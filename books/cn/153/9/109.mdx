《李安期》（出《朝野僉載》）“看判曰：‘書稍弱。’選人對曰：‘昨墜馬傷足。’安期曰：‘損足何廢好書？’”按此謔於英國名家小説中兩見。迭更司《滑稽外史》中一愚妄女子作書云： “吾父命我通書，因其足傷，不能把筆，醫言恐難復原”（My pa requests me to write to you，the doctors considering it doubt- ful whether he will ever recover the use of his legs which pre-vents his holding a pen）；蓋斯基爾夫人《鄉鎮舊聞》中一人致函言“勿許其妻作書，因妻足踝扭筋，握管不便”（His wife did not write，said the old gentleman，because he had forbidden it，she being indisposed with a sprained ankle，which（he said） incapacitated her from holding a pen）。
