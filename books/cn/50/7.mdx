richard feynman was worried about a number

in the 1940s he had worked out how

electrons interact with light an insight that earned him a nobel prize 

but a particular number bothered him

all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it

immediately you would like to know where this number comes from

nobody knows it's one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics 

a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man

that number was the fine structure constant it sits at the heart of feynman's theoretical success 

quantum electrodynamics 

it is a number that tells us about the strength of electromagnetism and has a value close to one divided by 137

feynman's theory cannot calculate this number and his equations are impotent until you measure its value in an experiment

and scientists today are still asking the same question that feynman did 70 years ago 

where does this number come from

and it is not alone

our physical theories are awash with constants of nature

they dictate how the fundamental pieces of the universe operate how electrons

repel electrons and how gravity draws matter together 

some of these constants are familiar such as the speed of light and planks constant 

others such as quark mixing and yukawa couplings are found within the complicated mathematics of physics on the edge 

and without measuring and calibrating these numbers all physical theories would be useless

the constants of nature are clearly central to all physics

but they appear to play a pivotal role in an even bigger question

how are we here to understand this 

we are going to have to take a journey into ourselves

peeling apart a human we find a complex mix of organs and fluids as we appear closer 

we find that these are built from a diverse range of individual cells 

each interacting to perform the task of the liver or muscle or the brain closer

still each cell is revealed to be a sea of complexity 

a wealth of smaller elements ribosomes and chromosomes

cytoplasm and mitochondria each playing a part in the running of the cell 

the pieces of these cells are composed of molecules proteins and lipids dna and rna 

each level so far has uncovered a wealth of complexity 

but as we go further simplicity appears molecules are built from atoms with 

each complex arrangement enabling the complex interactions with others 

but chemistry tells us that there are only 92 natural elements from hydrogen to uranium

so only 92 different kinds of atoms are available

entering the world of the subatomic and even simpler picture is uncovered with each atom being a mix of three different

particles protons and neutrons within the atomic nucleus with orbiting electrons and the protons and neutrons

are also composed of smaller particles

known as up and down quarks here at this fundamental level we find that matter

people trees planets and stars are nothing 

but different arrangements of these quarks and electrons

of course these pieces need glue to hold them together and for fundamental particles 

this is provided by the fundamental forces atomic nuclei are held together by the strong force atoms

hold on to electrons with the electromagnetic force gravity draws

matter together to form planets and

stars in the mix also is the weak force

which can influence the stability of atoms simply put 

we are built from the ground up our physical existence in this universe

is nothing more than the manifestation of a huge number of interactions of its fundamental pieces

and all these interactions are dictated by the values of the constants of nature

but where did these values come from

does the cosmos have to be this way

and was the fundamental universe primed from the big bang to now to necessarily

produce the complexity that appears to be essential for life

these seem like strange questions

we have only this universe with the values of these constants of nature

revealed to us by experiment

they appear to be written into the very fabric of existence

but science is built on what-if games

pondering how things would change if the situation were different

what if questions have the potential to answer not only the question of how we are here but maybe even why

the documentary streaming service question 

at the speed of light how long would it take to travel to andromeda our

nearest galaxy 

a 500 years 

b 2.5 million years or 

c 25 million years

that's right it's 2.5 million years and infinite energy

probably not worth it and so our recommendation this week is

thanks

standing here on earth it is easy to think that the universe was made for us

it feels like we are at the center of everything with the sun and the stars whirling around us

indeed as human civilization began our cosmic location was written into our developing religions

to the ancient babylonians our flat circular earth was surrounded by an infinite ocean of chaos

the greeks and romans saw the patterns in the stars as a storyboard of myths

and legends of gods and monsters in china the universe was arranged in rotating shells 

centered on the earth and containing the stars and planets

but science has since stripped away this illusion in 1543 

the astronomer and mathematician nicolaus copernicus displaced the earth 

placing the sun at the center of everything 

the dethroned earth orbited this fiery heart of the universe

the coming of the 20th century saw us

demoted further as massive telescopes

peered into the heavens it became clear

that the sun is but one of billions of

other stars within our milky way galaxy

and now we know the milky way is one of

potentially trillions of galaxies in the

observable universe

whilst hubble charted the cosmos

measuring immense distances between the

galaxies einstein friedman and lametra

found it to be evolving and expanding

born in an event 14 billion years ago we

now call the big bang

but where

does that leave us

one possible answer came from the ever

insightful douglas adams who wrote in

his comic novel hitchhiker's guide to

the galaxy

far out in the uncharted backwaters of

the unfashionable end of the western

spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small

unregarded yellow sun orbiting this at a

distance of roughly 92 million miles is

an utterly insignificant little

blue-green planet whose ape-descended

life forms are so amazingly primitive

that they still think digital watches

are a pretty neat idea

but far from just a punchline our

irrelevance in the cosmic scheme of

things has become a central tenet of

science

dubbed the copernican principle we have

developed our scientific theories based

on the idea that we are nowhere special

the view from the earth is essentially

the same as from any other vantage point

in the immense universe

we are little more than cosmological

bystanders

[Music]

or are we

in the 1960s princeton astronomer robert

dickey was seeking to understand the

origin of the universe

he was a polymath making important

discoveries in atomic physics and

einstein's general relativity

born from his thoughts on the birth of

the universe dickey had been thinking

about our cosmic location not in terms

of space

but in terms of time

he realized that living thinking beings

like us cannot exist at any random time

in the life of the universe

in the first couple of billion years the

universe was devoid of carbon oxygen and

other heavy elements as these were still

deep inside the first cosmic generation

of stars until these stars died the raw

material for complexity and life was

absent

and 100 billion years into the future

all stars like the sun would have died

and become white dwarfs the dominant

stars in the universe would be the puny

red dwarfs faint little stars whose

prospects for habitability are small

so he realized that there was a window

of time between the early and late

universe where life could thrive

a golden age of habitability

and of course we should not be surprised

to find ourselves living during this

time of cosmic history

we are not observing the universe at a

random point in its immense lifetime

decay posited but during a period that

allows us to be here

whilst this may not feel particularly

insightful it does shake the foundations

of the copernican principle a little

the situation became more complicated in

1973

at a conference held in krakow poland to

celebrate the 500th birthday of

copernicus australian physicist brandon

carter gave a speech

and he had copernicus squarely in his

sights

for humans observing the universe he

said

although our situation is not

necessarily central it is inevitably

privileged to some extent

for us to be here generations of stars

living over billions of years are

required to turn hydrogen into the

heavier elements essential for our

existence but carter went further

the lifespan of a star is determined by

the physical processes in its heart

gravity squeezes the stellar core

driving it to immense densities and

pressures in this environment new

elements are forged with the rate of

nuclear cooking determined by the other

fundamental forces electromagnetism and

the strong and weak nuclear forces

these elements forged in stars include

the iron in the earth's core and the

silicon in its crust it includes the

oxygen in the water of our oceans and

the carbon that is the basis for all

life on the planet

and so carter first coined a new concept

in contrast to the copernican principle

the anthropic principle

was born

our very existence some 14 billion years

after the birth of the universe is

because of the extremely delicate

balance of the fundamental forces that

govern the life cycles of stars

and so

taking all of this into account we are

left with a question

if

we are so privileged

what would happen

if that

were to change

what if gravity were a little stronger

or electromagnetism

a little weaker

what

if the rules of the universe

were different

in 1900 max planck was desperate

he had been struggling to understand how

objects glowed as you heated them from

red to white hot

like others he had been trying to use

the theory of light written into james

clark maxwell's theory of

electromagnetism

and

like the others he had failed

in his desperation he threw out the

classical ideas of heat and energy

thinking he had introduced little more

than a mathematical trick planck had

unknowingly invented quantum mechanics

but this trick this quantization worked

and planck would win the nobel prize in

1918 for his insight

nestled in his equation was a number

central to his result

today we call this number planck's

constant in honor of its discoverer and

this number now has a central role in

quantum physics explaining not only how

hot objects glow but atomic structure

the interaction of matter and light and

a myriad of strange quantum effects

it is a constant of nature

and these numbers are essential for

studying hypothetical other universes

[Music]

physics is written in the language of

mathematics

and through mathematical equations we

make predictions on how objects behave

when we want to understand the motion of

the moon we can combine newton's laws of

motion and gravity to predict where the

moon will be tomorrow or in a week or in

a thousand years

when we want to understand the flow of

electricity we can use maxwell's

equations of electromagnetism and the

properties of electrons to deduce the

expected reading on an amateur but the

equations of physics are not purely

mathematical you cannot determine how

things evolve from mathematical

manipulation alone there is another

vital ingredient that has to be added

the values of the constants of nature in

newton's theory of gravity there is the

gravitational constant and without

knowing its value the equations are

sterile in electromagnetism there are

the permeabilities and permittivities of

electricity and magnetism without

knowing their values maxwell's equations

are muted and to determine the value of

these constants scientists must ask

nature

they have to measure them

the year is 1798 and henry cavendish is

about to run his experiment

one more time

he places his eye to the telescope which

is not faced towards the heavens

but through brick poking through a small

hole in the wall of a shed in his garden

so as not to interrupt the incredibly

delicate apparatus he has placed it

inside a wooden box within the shed

protecting it from wind and the outside

world the equipment itself measures the

strength of gravity between lead balls

using an incredibly sensitive torsion

balance and with it cavendish was able

to measure the density of the entire

earth

weighing the world as he called it a

result which led directly to the

calculation of the gravitational

constant with accuracy not exceeded for

another hundred years

and this quest for exactness continues

to this very day with the constant g

known to six decimal places

and it's not just gravity measurements

for the speed of light which is the

ultimate constant for electromagnetism

and plonk's constant have been refined

over decades they are joined by more

esoteric values such as the strength of

the higgs field and the mixing angles of

quarks

as well as the constants of nature there

are other values of the universe that

cannot be deduced solely from

mathematics and so must be discovered

these include the masses of the

fundamental particles such as the quarks

and electrons that comprise all of

matter

these values are in fact so important

that physics textbooks tabulate them so

readers can use the equations of physics

between the covers

of course the constants tend to have

units and so changing from meters and

kilograms to feet and pounds will mean

that the value of the constants will

change

so scientists focus upon combinations of

the constants that are dimensionless a

proton for example is

1836 times heavier than an electron if

the masses are measured in kilograms

pounds or troy ounces

but why 1836

why do the constants have the particular

values they do

how would the universe have been

different if this ratio had been 18 or

18 000

and so we return to the fine structure

constant

why is it one divided by 137

theoretically these are questions we can

start to answer we can solve our

equations of physics when considering

different values for the fundamental

constants with this we can calculate

what would happen in the hypothetical

universe if gravity was a thousand times

stronger than in our universe gripping

the earth more tightly in the sun's grip

making us orbit more rapidly but this is

not quite what we are searching for

if we want to know how the universe

would have turned out if the constants

of nature had been different we must

consider the evolutionary history of the

cosmos with a different strength of

gravity or electromagnetism or heavier

electrons or some other mix of different

physics

we have to go back

to the beginning

naively we may think that this might

change the time period when complexity

and life could have arisen in the

universe if gravity was increased that

would increase the rate at which nuclear

reactions could happen meaning heavier

elements and hence life could have

appeared earlier in the universe

but this

as scientists have discovered

is thinking far

far too small

[Music]

astronomers have had great success in

explaining our universe playing

by the rules

around the globe teams of scientists are

building their own synthetic universes

translating the equations of cosmology

and astrophysics into computer code

with the aid of supercomputers they can

trace the complex interplay of matter

and radiation in an expanding universe

as computer power has grown so has the

scale of the synthetic universes with

projects such as the illustrious tng or

the next generation tracing the cosmic

evolution of a cubic chunk of synthetic

universe a billion light years on a side

over the billions of years within these

synthetic universes cosmic expansion

acts to pull mata further apart while

gravity acts to draw it together mass

clumps into proto-galaxies whilst the

computers solve the equations for the

flow of gas and the formation of stars

within these synthetic universes stars

live out their lives some exploding

spectacularly as supernovae whilst

others expire with a final puff

all the while the computer programs are

tracking the formation and dispersal of

elements as generations of stars come

and go

an inspection of these synthetic

universes reveals rich structure with

synthetic galaxies and clusters clouds

of pure gas left over from the big bang

and other clouds polluted with heavier

elements

these synthetic universes look just like

ours a confirmation that the universe we

see around us is imprinted and shaped by

the physics underlying the cosmos

and the same is true for our existence

the presence of complex molecules

composed of atoms is also a

manifestation of this physics of the

fundamental the result of stars being

able to undergo nuclear burning at their

cores

of course if we can generate a synthetic

universe on a computer or even with

paper and pencil for the physics of our

universe it seems that it should be

simple to think of different physics in

hypothetical universes all we need to do

is to change the numerical values of the

constants of nature maybe we just tweak

our computer code press go and see how

early or how late life arises or how

many arms or legs we end up with

but is it really

that straightforward

we are the result of a complex web of

physical interactions over the billions

of years of the life of the cosmos and

to truly answer the question of

habitability we must understand how

cutting the web or even forging new

pathways

impacts the existence of the complexity

needed for life

a limited view might come from

simplified cases but to truly capture

the complexity scientists turn to the

power of supercomputers to churn through

interweaved equations

they are still unraveling the

habitability of other universes

but as they survey the multiverse of

possibilities

the view

is a grim one

calculations reveal a vast ocean

of darkness

and death

almost every other possible universe

appears to be lifeless

and sterile

in many universes there is no structure

no galaxies stars and planets in others

no complexity no periodic table of

elements dotted among the dead universes

there are little islands of complexity

and potentially life

but these

are almost vanishingly rare

let's consider some examples of what

happens when you play

with the constants of nature

[Music]

in our universe the relative masses of

the fundamental up and down quarks mean

that the proton is lighter than the

neutron

this means that neutrons decay into

protons and so just after the big bang

the cosmos was awash with protons these

protons are the hearts of every hydrogen

atom providing the universe the

potential to form stars and heavier

elements

ultimately this endowed our universe

with the potential to create us

messing with the masses of the quarks

can have a radical effect if the down

quark was lighter the neutron would be

less massive than the proton in such a

universe the big bang would have

resulted in a sea of inert neutrons

stars of neutrons would form but no

nuclear fires would burn in this

universe there would be no periodic

table of elements there would be no

complexity

there would be

no life

instead of quarks we could consider the

mass of the electron zipping around the

nucleus these dictate the world of

chemistry of how mata can join into

molecules and crystals in our universe

the nuclear force is thousands of times

more massive than the electron but if

the electron were more massive its high

speed orbit would cause the nucleus to

rattle around in response this rattling

would impact the ability of atoms to

bond together and there becomes a point

where nothing but individual atoms could

exist

everything would be a gas

with no molecules

and no solids the prospects for life

are bleak

and a universe with a different force of

gravity is equally dramatic if not more

so firstly it is gravity that is

responsible for drawing mata together in

the early universe forming the first

stars and galaxies if gravity was too

weak then the expanding universe would

have remained an ever-thinning soup of

hydrogen gas if gravity were too strong

then mata would be quickly drawn into

numerous black holes locking away the

atomic material needed for life

and even between these two extremes

gravity plays a pivotal role

the lives of stars are dictated by the

influence of gravity squeezing the

stellar core to the point where nuclear

reactions can ignite

squeezing too weakly will result in

stars being nothing more than immense

balls of cooling gas

squeezing too hard means that the

nuclear reactor would kick into

overdrive burning through the available

material in much less than the 10

billion year lifetime of stars like the

sun

long-lived stable stars appear to walk a

knife edge when it comes to the strength

of gravity

and finally even changing the values of

things that we've only just discovered

would have an enormous impact on

habitability

in our universe today dark energy is the

dominant component and is driving the

expansion faster and faster in the early

universe mata dominated steadily slowing

expansion until dark energy took over

roughly 5 billion years ago this slowing

expansion in the early universe gave

gravity the time to draw mata into stars

and galaxies in the distant future dark

energy will dilute the universe to such

an extent that each galaxy will appear

alone in the darkness

but if there were more dark energy in

the universe it would have dominated

earlier it could have started its

accelerated expansion a lot earlier

before mata had the chance to collapse

into the first stars in such a universe

individual hydrogen atoms would find

themselves alone

in cold empty space the prospects for

life would have been negligible

and there are many more components of

the universe we could consider such as

the speed of light the scalar of quantum

mechanics or the stability of dark

matter for some of these the range over

which complexity and habitability

results can be relatively large but for

others a percentage change here or there

can have a dramatic impact

consideration of each aspect of physics

rules out a chunk of hypothetical

universes that could ever host life

in this sea of potential universes

ours is the exception

not the rule

in this sea of potential universes

we

are effectively

alone

and so we have answered the first

question

how are we here

we are the result of an almost perfectly

balanced selection of rules interacting

over 13.8 billion years

but now the second question rears its

head

why

[Music]

the constants of nature have always had

a mystical aura to some physicists

there must they feel be some reason for

their particular values

some have even turned to numerology

siratha eddington astronomer at the

university of cambridge and the first

person to conduct an experiment to

verify einstein's general theory of

relativity fell into this trap

like feynman he was consumed by the fine

structure constant thinking that it

might be exactly 1 over 137

he concluded that this value was related

to the total number of protons in the

observable universe but as measurements

of the fine structure constant became

more accurate it was realized that it

was not one divided by an integral value

and eddington's idea was quietly dropped

but the connections between the

constants of nature might be telling us

something deeper

as our scientific theories advance and

disparate pieces are united as one the

number of these constants needed to

describe the universe decreases

before maxwell two separate constants

were needed one to describe the action

of electric phenomena and another to

describe magnetism within maxwell's

equations these two numbers were united

into a single constant of nature

the speed of light

and so is this the answer if physicists

work hard enough to produce a theory of

everything will all of fundamental

physics be unified no constants left

just pure mathematics the notion of this

ultimate theory is currently a moonshot

idea in physics and it might not exist

but the moment's thought also reveals

that this would not really provide us

with an answer we would just change the

question

why then would these mathematical

expressions

allow us to be here

it offers us nothing but another vast

graveyard of dead alternate universes

with no explanation

and the question would still remain why

is the physics just right enough

for us to be here

to some this fine tuning of the physical

properties of our universe is because

there is a fine tuner a divine being

that made the universe for us

of course this fits neatly with a lot of

religious ideas around the globe and the

fine-tuning argument is often taken as

evidence for the existence of at least

one god

but there is an alternate idea

university of oxford philosopher nick

bostrom has noted that we understand the

universe by simulating pieces of it on a

computer in the future when computers

become more powerful we will be able to

simulate more of the complexities of the

universe to finer detail perhaps our

computers will grow so powerful that

conscious beings will be part of the

program and maybe these beings will

happily exist in their universe without

realizing their reality is nothing but a

simulation

and maybe in the future we won't just

simulate one universe but a variety of

universes each with differing laws of

physics and properties of course we will

not simulate boring universes where

nothing happens

no we will focus our resources on

interesting universes with interesting

things

like life

and bostrom takes this idea of simulated

universes one step further

and wonders if it has already happened

not inside our universe but with our

universe being simulated within someone

else's

our laws of physics are nothing but

executing computer code

so our thoughts and experiences of

reality

so we should not be surprised to find

ourselves in such universe

as the great programmer in the sky above

is expending their computational

resources on us

an interesting

simulation this idea is loved by

philosophers but scientists not so much

what can we do with this concept how do

we test we are in a simulation if all we

do is express computer code as the laws

of physics

and of course there is the problem of

whether the universe above is a

simulation also

and we are left with turtles

all the way up

but there is one more idea that science

has posited

what if all these possible universes

are not hypothetical

what if they are real distinct universes

out there in a real

multiverse

we don't yet have a definitive theory of

a multiverse it is more of a collection

of disparate ideas but perhaps within

the multiverse there is a process that

generates individual universes each

universe born with its own distinct set

of physical laws selected at random by

some role of the metaphorical dice even

our own universe if started again could

have been born with different physical

laws

of course in the multiverse picture most

of the individual universes are dead and

sterile

in this picture we were lucky we got

that roll of the dice that allows us to

be here

the concept of the multiverse is not

universally loved among cosmologists

with declarations that it is extremely

wasteful to have all these dead

universes so ours could live others

point out that the multiverse is not

really a theory as there is no

mathematics to back it up or predictions

we could test as those other universes

will always remain disconnected from us

and so the question remains

the whims of gods computer simulations

or multiverses

perhaps one of these will eventually

give us an answer

or something stranger

still

but before that time considering both

the how and why of our existence

still has a lot to tell us about the

universe
