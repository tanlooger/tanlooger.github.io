Dubai Creek Tower -  A massive construction project that was supposed to become the Tallest Structure in the World! But what has happened to the Dubai Creek Tower? Will this megaproject ever be finished? Let's find out!

迪拜云溪塔目标是争世界第一高塔的庞然大物，但只打了个地基就不停建了。迪拜云溪塔发生了什么变故？这个世界最高的塔为什么停了？请听解释！

迪拜云溪塔设计高度1300公尺，将打破世界记录。

2016年10月10日举行奠基仪式，六年过去了，还是只有个地基。

地面上没有任何建设，就是整个迪拜云溪港工程也只建了很小一部分。

为什么停工了？难道这个1300公尺的巨大工程官宣失败了？

尽管云溪塔工程很大，但也只是迪拜云溪港工程的一部分。

当然云溪塔将是云溪港的地标建筑。

云溪港附近的湿地有超过450种保护动物。

云溪港工程是个致力于人与自然和谐相处的现代生态工程。

这项工程会有大量植物空间并使用太阳能，尽量减少对自然环境的影响。

云溪港是迪拜控股和伊玛尔地产的主要合作项目。

伊玛尔地产就是目前世界最高楼哈利法塔的开发商。

云溪港计划未来20年为200,000个家庭，450,000人提供生活工作支持。

预计会是世界最大的步行区，且是个无障碍和可持续的未来城市。

但是迪拜控股和伊玛尔地产的合作项目，今年夏天变成了伊玛尔地产100%控股。

伊玛尔地产花了20亿美元从迪拜控股手中买断了这600万平方公尺的地产，相当于两个纽约中央公园大小。

这说明伊玛尔地产并没有放弃这个项目，也许不久就会复工。
 
建成后云溪塔是云溪港的中心，也是世界最高的建筑。

它的设计汇集了目前人类最先进的数学、技术和物理知识。

云溪塔外观似沙漠百合花蕾，清真寺的塔尖常用这种设计，属于伊斯兰教传统。

但要建一千多公尺高，难度非常大，几乎不可能完成。

为了达到这个高度，铁塔由110公里长的钢索阵列支撑，这些钢索也被用来创造视觉效果。

为使玻璃面产生特殊的视觉效果，云溪塔需要昼夜发光。

这需要太阳能和节水技术的帮助下自动完成。

玻璃墙的自清洁系统使用可持续冷却系统的水。

塔上的水，太阳能板及室内花园的水都会收集再利用。

此外，遮阳系统和翼门将有助于节省更多的能源。

塔顶的椭圆“花蕾”处设有十个观景台，包括塔尖的观景室，可以360度观看这个城市。

200层的建筑只有20层可用，也就是说云溪塔不能算是“摩天大楼”。

云溪塔算是一件昂贵的艺术品，用来吸引并鼓舞游客，也用来证明我们这个时代的建筑成就。

云溪塔具体高度还是个秘密，但在6年前开始建造时，有人暗示会远远超过1公里。

因为2013年沙特建的吉达塔对标828公尺高的哈利法塔，计划超过1公里。

你也许会说追求最高建筑的名头不明智，但如果看了哈利法塔带来的收益你就不会这么说了。

每年的2000万游客带来了300亿美元的旅游收入。

因而建造破记录的摩天建筑被认为是正确的经济策略。

保持世界最高建筑的头衔在经济和战略上都很重要。

云溪塔本想学历史上的埃菲尔铁塔，在2020年的迪拜世博会上开放，预示新时代的到来。

但2018年打好地基后就没了动静，更奇怪的是几乎同一时间吉达塔也没了动静。

从此这两个建筑就搁置了下来。

难道迪拜在观望沙特的吉达塔？

因为它们都在争世界最高塔的名头。

或者是全球性的疫情和经济衰退让这两个巨大工程无限期推迟。

由于政治阴谋导致两名关键人物入狱，吉达塔在建到300米高时停了下来。

几周这两人放了出来，吉达塔重新开工。

几个月后因为与承包商的劳工纠纷又停了下来。

新冠爆发后就一直停了下来。

云溪塔为什么也停了呢？

新冠爆发前云溪塔开发商曾与一家中国公司签了合同。

当疫情爆发时，这些建设计划被取消。

还有没有更深层的原因？

云溪塔的口号是“灵感来自国家，设计面向世界”，显示了迪拜对云溪塔的期待和雄心。

与人们普遍认为迪拜的巨大成功仅仅归功于石油的发现相反。

实际上是政府的免税政策和法律允许外国投资者购买房产，使迪拜有了今天的建筑奇迹。

石油只是迪拜正确迈出的一小步，让它的其他投资成为可能。

在2018年之前，阿联酋是最后几个免征所得税的增长经济体之一。

因有许多免税区，使生意很容易。

但自2018年1月以来，一切都变了。

阿联酋引入了增值税，但还只是个开始。

尽管税率适中，但这意味着企业现在必须计算税款，并要担心不遵守新法律会受到的处罚。

2021年，阿联酋引入了另一种税收——对公司利润征收公司税。

做生意变得更加复杂了，但还没结束。

除了税收负担，阿联酋还必须满足联合国2030年议程的复杂和昂贵的要求。

阿联酋1971年加入联合国。

《2030年可持续发展议程》于2015年在纽约举行的联合国峰会上提出。

旨在实现绿色、可持续和不损害气候和环境的智能增长。

承诺要拯救地球，免于毁灭。但这里有一个技巧。

每年都有新要求，不仅要基于设想的时间框架，还要基于新的科学研究和建议。

这说明云溪塔10亿美元的预算就不够了。
 
还有全球性的疫情和经济危机让更多人选择在家办公，很多大型办公楼都没人了。

伊玛尔地产的房产也不好卖了，迪拜的公寓和写字楼总体上出现了严重的供过于求。

显然这种情况下进行大量投资不是明智的选择。

总之，从阿联酋新引入的企业税，环保要求、断裂的供应链，到疫情影响、游客消费能力的下降，一起导致了云溪塔停工。

Dubai Creek Tower - the first tower to reach a record-breaking height of 1300 meters.

迪拜云溪塔设计高度1300公尺，将打破世界记录。

An architectural masterpiece designed to be the tallest man-made structure in the world.

Yet six years after construction began, the tower consists only of the foundation.

2016年10月10日举行奠基仪式，六年过去了，还是只有个地基。

No work has been done above the ground and only a small part of the original master plan for the Dubai Creek has been built.

地面上没有任何建设，就是整个迪拜湾工程也只建了很小一部分。

So what has happened?

为什么停工了？难道这个1300公尺的巨大工程官宣失败了？

Has this 1300-meter-tall megaproject officially failed?

Let’s find out!
 

While the Dubai Creek Tower is already massive on its own,

it is part of something even bigger.

The tower is the centerpiece of the Creek Harbour megaproject,

which is located on the banks of Dubai Creek, right next to a protected wildlife

wetland with more than 450 species of animals.

The Creek Harbour megaproject is dedicated to the conservation of wildlife and harmony with the natural environment,

using the most modern ecological solutions. 

The project will be interspersed with green spaces and powered by solar energy to minimize the impact on the environment.

Dubai Creek Harbour was started as a major joint project between Dubai Holding and Emaar Properties,

which also built the Burj Khalifa, the current world's tallest skyscraper.

The area will be built over the next 20 years and provide space for more than 200,000 residents and 450,000 living and working people.

It is set to become the largest pedestrian zone in the world,

creating an accessible and sustainable city of the future.

But what started as a partnership between Emaar Properties and the state-owned Dubai Holding, 
became 100% Emaar Properties in the summer of 2022.

Emaar Properties bought out Dubai Holding for $2 billion and will now have full control  over the development and future profit of 6 million square meters of real estate, roughly the size of 2 New York Central Parks. 

This shows that Emaar Properties hasn't abandoned  its big plans.

And that we may soon see the continuation of the Tower’s construction.
 

When completed, the Creek tower will be the centerpiece of the Harbor and one of the most  significant structures ever created.

The design is based on the most advanced mathematical,  technical and physical methods known today.

It is almost impossible to build a super-tall tower in  the shape of a desert lily flower.

A long, thin flower reminiscent of the traditional Islamic  architecture of minarets, an important part of mosques.

To achieve this height, the tower is  supported by a 110 kilometer array of steel cables that are also used to create visual effects.

Together with the special glass facade, the Creek tower will emit light both day and night.
 

And it will be completely self-sufficient with the help of solar energy and water conservation.

The  self-cleaning façade will use water from a sustainable cooling system.

Water will  be collected from the creek, solar panels, and hanging gardens.

In addition, a shading system and  wing doors will help to save even more energy.

At the top, an oval bud will house ten observation  platforms,
including the Pinnacle Room with 360-degree views of the city.

Yet of the 200  floors, only 20 will be usable,
which means that the tower will not be classified as a skyscraper.

The Creek Tower will primarily serve as a lavish art installation and inspiring tourist attraction,

testifying to the architectural achievements of our time.
 

While the exact height of the strucure remains a secret, when constructed started 6 years ago,

it was hinted that the Creek Tower would be much more than 1 km high.

This was because another record-breaking building was expected to reach one kilometer,
knocking Dubai’s 828-meter Burj Khalifa out of first place.

The Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, construction of which had begun only three years earlier.
 

It may seem nonsensical to chase the world title of the tallest building until you look at the profit that the Burj Khalifa has brought to Dubai.

20 million more visitors to the city and annual revenues equal to the $30 billion they spend every year.

Inspiring record-breaking architecture is thus rightly seen as an economic strategy in the Middle East.

Retaining the title of the tallest building in the world is economically and strategically important.

The Creek Tower was to be opened at Dubai 2020 Expo and herald a new era,

just as the Eiffel Tower did at the Paris World's Fair in 1889.

But in 2018, after the foundation work was completed, everything came to a halt.

And the strange thing is that this happened at the same time that the construction of the Jeddah Tower was halted.

So currently, both projects have been on hold for many years.

Could it be that Dubai is taking its time to see what happens with Jeddah Tower? 

Especially because they are not in danger of losing their title any time soon.

Or is it more likely that the global pandemic and recession has brought this megaproject to an indefinite stop?

The Jeddah Tower stopped at 300 meters after it was put on hold due to a political intrigue that saw two key players imprisoned.

After a few weeks, they were released from prison and construction resumed.

But not for long.

Just a few months later, the whole megaproject was halted again due to labor issues with a contractor.

COVID pandemic then sealed construction indefinitely.

But what about the Dubai Creek Tower?

Right before COVID hit, the developers of the tower were about to sign a contract with a Chinese company to continue construction and finish the project.

When the pandemic broke out, these construction plans were cancelled. 

But is there more to this story?

The Tower’s slogan “Inspired by the nation, designed for the world” underlines the great architectural ambition for which Dubai has become famous.

Contrary to popular belief that Dubai owes its majestic success only to the discovery of oil,
it was actually the government's tax-free policies and laws that allowed foreign investors to buy properties that made Dubai the architectural wonder it is today. 

Oil was just a nudge in the right direction that made other investments possible.

And until 2018, the UAE was one of the last growing economies to be free of income tax.

It was easy to do business thanks to the numerous free tax zones.

But since January 2018, everything has changed.

The UAE introduced Value Added Tax, and that was just the beginning.

Even though the tax rate was modest, it meant that businesses now had to calculate the taxes and worry about the penalties if they didn't comply with the new laws.

And in 2021, the UAE introduced another tax - a corporate tax on company profits.

Doing business got even more complicated.

But that’s not all.

In addition to the tax burden, the UAE must also meet the complex and costly requirements of the UN Agenda 2030.

The UAE has been a member of the UN since 1971.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was launched in 2015 at a UN summit 
in New York and aims to achieve green, sustainable and smart growth that doesn't harm the climate or the environment.

The commitment is to save the planet from destruction, but here's the trick.

The new requirements are set each year not only on the basis of the envisaged timeframe, but also on the basis of new scientific research and recommendations.

All this means that the original $1 billion budget for the Dubai Creek Tower is now absolutely insufficient to complete the project under the current circumstances.
 

Another major factor brought about by the pandemic and the global economic crisis is that more and more people have switched to telecommuting, leaving large office buildings empty.

Emaar Properties hasn't sold nearly enough properties, and there's a massive oversupply of flats and offices in Dubai in general.

So it does not seem like the right time to pursue another big business investment that is unlikely to pay off in the current circumstances.

Yes, everything has changed for the UAE, from newly introduced corporate taxes,

green requirements, and broken supply chains to new human behaviors and tourists' financial capabilities.

Great architecture has always been a witness to time,
so it is not surprising that everything our world has experienced globally in recent years is reflected in the Dubai Creek Tower - whose foundations are a hope for a new, glorious future that will hopefully be upon us.
