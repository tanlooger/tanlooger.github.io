title: CHAPTER 6 PUT IT IN THE VAULT
---

As the islander’s fish-savings increased, storage became an issue. People traditionally kept fish in their huts, but that proved too inefficient and even dangerous. Fish filchers became a big problem.

And while the islanders would have liked to use their excess savings to grow through loans and investments, most individual savers had neither the time nor the training to judge the merits of business propositions offered to them.

Sensing a solid business opportunity, an islander named Max Goodbank decided to launch a revolutionary service.

After guarding his own fish for years, Max knew there had to be a better way to store his savings. And after seeing so many of his neighbors get hoodwinked by slick fish borrowers, he also knew that most people needed help in deciding how their savings should be lent. With these thoughts in mind, he built a large, climate-controlled facility staffed by the toughest galoots on the island. The new “bank” would safely store the island’s collective fish savings and consequently solve the theft problem. But this was just the beginning.…

Being a true entrepreneur, Max knew that if all he did was charge a storage fee, his profit potential would be limited.

He understood the value of savings and he knew he could do a better job at lending than a typical islander. As a top-notch mathematician, Max was particularly good at evaluating business plans and structuring equitable loans.

With the fish earned from the loans of his neighbor’s fish, he would pay interest to depositors and wages to his galoots. He would keep the leftover profit for himself.

The Goodbank Savings and Loan was born!

Just like Able and Duffy, Max initially sought to benefit his own pocketbook. But to do so, he helped solve the island’s thorny issues of savings, credit, and theft.

Now, when the “Ables” of the island underconsume, they delegate their investment responsibility to Goodbank by depositing their fish savings in his bank.

Those requiring loans in order to finance capital projects, need only see Mr. Goodbank rather than anyone who seemed to be sitting on a tidy pile of fish.

For the scheme to work, Max had to keep a number of balls in the air at once. First, he had to keep his loan business profitable, which meant he had to carefully screen borrowers, scrupulously collect interest, and foreclose on collateral when loans failed. Second, he had to keep his depositors happy through regular interest payments. Last, he had to attract more borrowers to keep the cycle running. If he failed, he would be out of a job, and his investment would be wasted.

Naturally, with his ability to specialize in the tasks associated with efficient and profitable lending, Max became the island’s foremost expert on fish economics. And whereas less specialized lenders tended to be influenced by factors such as personal history, family relationship, and emotion, with Goodbank, it all boiled down to dollars and cents, or rather fins and scales.

## Interest Rates

With his personal well-being so intertwined with the success of the bank, Max was in the ideal position to determine the best interest rates to pay depositors and to charge borrowers.

On the lending side, he offered the lowest interest rate to the most secure borrowers (those with the highest ability to repay the loans). For dicier borrowers he charged a higher rate to compensate for the added risk.

These loan rates then determined how much interest the bank could pay depositors, who received payments on a similarly sliding scale. Longer-held deposits lowered the bank’s risk of a fish shortage. Accordingly, higher interest payments were offered to those willing to leave their fish on deposit for a while. People who could not commit to a longer time frame got lower rates.

Although Goodbank administered the rates, the entire interest rate system itself fluctuated according to market conditions that were largely beyond Goodbank’s control.

Sometimes big gains in productivity made the island’s savings swell. When the vault was filled to the rafters with fish, the bank would be willing to drop the rates charged on loans. That was because the losses would be easier to bear in relative terms, and the healthy economy that produced the savings in the first place would provide a fertile environment for new businesses.

With little need to attract new savings, and with lower rates charged to borrowers, such an environment would also lead to lower payments to depositors, which would discourage savings.

When savings dipped (which is dangerous for an economy), opposite forces would come into play that would tend to encourage savings, thereby replenishing bank coffers.

When the fish were few, Goodbank had to be extra careful with loans. With thin reserves, loan defaults could be critical. In order to compensate for the increased relative risk, Max charged higher rates to borrowers, and offered higher rates to depositors in order to encourage more savings.

Higher interest rates would discourage borrowing and slow business growth. But the higher rates would also encourage savings. Eventually coffers would build up again and rates would then start to drop.

In addition, a lower savings rate indicated a preference for more immediate consumption. As a result, long-term capital investments designed to provide goods for future consumption would be discouraged.

This cyclical interest rate mechanism—firmly regulated by the desire to maximize the returns on the bank’s deposits, the fear of losing capital on risky ventures, and individual time preferences for consumption—produced a rate of interest that would stabilize the market.

Most importantly, the safety and convenience of the bank encouraged people to save. Deferring consumption to a later date provided financing for capital projects that would increase future production and raise living standards.

Under Mr. Goodbank’s wise and conservative care, the island’s savings and commerce continue to grow.

## High-Risk Investment

Given his need to continually pay interest to his depositors, Mr. Goodbank tended to shy away from loans that had a high probability of default. He refused to risk the islanders’ savings on vacation loans, consumption loans, or any other “fish in the dish” ideas that promised the moon but could offer no realistic assumptions about potential success.

But some savers wanted to take greater risks for greater rewards. Occasionally potential breakthrough projects came along that were very enticing, but ultimately just too risky for the bank to fund.

Sling-Flight Airways pitched an idea that could revolutionize interisland travel.

But Goodbank, true to form, didn’t bite.

But that didn’t mean that the backers of Sling-Flight were out of options.

A new investment pool had arrived on the scene, run by the flamboyant fish tycoon Manny Fund. Manny took in fish from savers who were not content with the modest returns paid by Goodbank. With these fish he rolled the dice on high-profile projects.

Some of the projects he funded worked out, like the Paradise Beverage Company.

And others did not, like the Blubmarine Underwater Tour Company.

So, while Goodbank continued to finance capital growth through conservative forms of investment, Manny Fund became the choice for the risk takers.

TAKE AWAY

In addition to distorting the credit market by passing laws that favor certain types of loans and certain types of borrowers, government also influences the flow of credit in a more fundamental manner: through its control of interest rates. For almost 100 years, the Federal Reserve (in theory a private bank, but in practice an extension of the Treasury Department), has set the base level for interest rates upon which the entire rate structure rests.

By setting its “federal funds” rate higher or lower, the Fed (as the bank is known) does not dictate the particular rate any bank offers for every loan, but it does move the entire market up or down. Banks will always charge a higher rate to the public than they pay the Fed to borrow money. So when the Fed raises or lowers its rates, businesses and individuals will pay more, or less, to borrow.

The Fed was given this authority in order to keep the economy running smoothly in good times and bad. The theory goes that the collective wisdom of Fed economists could help keep the economy on track by determining the optimal interest rate for any particular moment in time.

For instance, the Fed could boost a struggling economy by lowering interest rates to the point where businesses and consumers would be more inclined to borrow. In very good times, when overconfidence often leads to foolishness, the Fed is supposed to do the opposite and raise rates so that people will think twice about taking out loans.

This system has two massive flaws.

First, it assumes that a small group of people at the Fed can make better decisions than millions of people making independent decisions (also known as “the marketplace”) about the proper level of interest rates. But, the Fed has “no skin in the game,” as the saying goes. It does not generate the savings and will not suffer if loans go bad. The people saved the money and the bank’s profits depend on its wise stewardship. Without this connection, lending is inherently inefficient.

Second, the Fed’s decisions are always determined by political, rather than economic, considerations. As low rates tend to make the economy appear better on the surface, push down the cost of servicing mortgages and other loans, and help financial firms make money, there are a great many people who want lower rates. Presidents seeking reelection will always bang the drum for lower rates, and they will pressure the Fed to help out. On their part, Fed policy makers naturally want to be seen as the good guys who help the economy, not the tightfisted Scrooges who push it into recession.

The members of society who would favor high rates, most notably the savers, have no well-organized interest group. Their voices are never heard. As a result, there is a consistent bias toward holding rates too low, rather than too high. Remember, low rates encourage borrowing and discourage saving. Not surprisingly, the United States has been transformed from a nation of savers to a nation of borrowers.

In addition, rates that are too low relative to the supply of savings send false signals to borrowers about the health of the economy and the viability of investments. Since consumption has not really been deferred to the future (which would be the case had interest rates fallen due to market forces), capital investments intended to satisfy future consumption will be much less likely to succeed. The result is phony booms followed by spectacular busts, such as those just experienced in stocks and real estate.
