A to Z of Nutritional Healing


While there is no substitute for individual assessment of nutrient needs, the following nutritional advice is helpful for people suffering from particular health problems. For the more serious conditions, it is best to follow these programs under the supervision of your doctor or nutrition consultant. The supplements recommended are for adults and are based on the formulas given in chapter 47. Since dosage is crucial, it is best to get supplements close to these formulas. When individual amounts of a nutrient are given, these are the total required. Check that you are not “doubling up” by receiving, for example, vitamin A in a multivitamin, an antioxidant, and a separate supplement.

For further guidance on supplement doses, stay within the ranges given in chapter 45, using the higher amounts for conditions that are specifically helped by these nutrients, or when symptoms of deficiency are present.

All the recommendations given here are for adults. For guidance on supplemental levels for children, see chapter 40. For babies and infants, I recommend you read my book Optimum Nutrition Before, During and After Pregnancy.

The recommendations given are aimed at helping to restore health in these conditions. They do not replace medical advice, nor should they be continued on an ongoing basis once the condition is corrected.

The basics for any supplement program, given on this page, are 2 × a high-strength multivitamin and mineral (you can’t get optimum levels in only one pill), 1 gram or more of vitamin C, and an essential omega-3 and omega-6 supplement. You can get daily packs of these “basics,” which is a good place to start, adding any extras. The supplement directory in the Resources section gives some “best fit” products that meet the recommendations given below.
