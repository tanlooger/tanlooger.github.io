title: 10. Sugar—The Sweet Truth
---




The human body is designed to run on carbohydrates. While we can use protein and fat for energy, the easiest and most “smoke-free” fuel is carbohydrate. Plants make carbohydrate by trapping the sun’s energy in a complex of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Water from the roots provides the hydrogen and oxygen (H2O), while carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air provides carbon and more oxygen. Vegetation consists mainly of carbohydrate. We eat the carbohydrate and, in the presence of oxygen from the air, break it down and release the stored solar energy that then provides energy for the body and mind.

When you eat complex carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables, beans, or lentils, or simpler carbohydrates such as fruit, the body does exactly what it is designed to do. It digests these foods and gradually releases their potential energy. What is more, all the nutrients that the body needs for digestion and metabolism are present in those whole foods. Such foods also contain a less digestible type of carbohydrate, classified as fiber, which helps keep the digestive system running smoothly.

While a cat likes the taste of protein, humans are principally attracted to the taste of carbohydrate—sweetness. This inherent attraction toward sweetness worked well for early man because most things in nature that are sweet are not poisonous. It worked well for plants too. They hid their seeds in their fruit, waiting for animals to pass by, eat the fruit, and deposit the seed some distance from the original plant, along with an “organic manure” starter kit!

But we have discovered how to extract the sweetness and leave the rest—bad news for our nutrition. All forms of concentrated sugar—white sugar, brown sugar, malt, glucose, honey, and syrup—are fast releasing, causing a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. If this sugar is not required by the body, it is put into storage, eventually emerging as fat. Most concentrated forms of sugar are also devoid of vitamins and minerals, unlike the natural sources such as fruit. White sugar has around 90 percent of its vitamins and minerals removed. Without vitamins and minerals our metabolism becomes inefficient, contributing to poor energy and poor weight control.



The carbohydrate family.

Fruit contains a simple sugar called fructose, which needs no digesting and can therefore enter the bloodstream quickly, like glucose or sucrose. However, unlike them it is classified as slow releasing. This is because the body cannot use fructose as it is, since cells run only on glucose. As a result, the fructose first has to be converted by the body into glucose, which effectively slows down this sugar’s effect on the metabolism. Lactose, milk sugar, is similar. It is made up of glucose and galactose. The glucose is fast releasing while the galactose is slow releasing. Some fruit, such as grapes and dates, also contain pure glucose and are therefore faster releasing. Apples, on the other hand, contain mainly fructose and so are slow releasing. Bananas contain both and therefore raise blood sugar levels quite speedily.



Lactose (milk sugar) versus sucrose (sugar) versus maltose (malt). Galactose and fructose (shown in gray) are slow-releasing sugars while glucose is fast Hence lactose and sucrose are much slower releasing than maltose, a grain sugar that is quickly digested into two glucose molecules.

Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice, and refined cereals have a similar effect to refined sugar, while oats are more “complex” and their release of sugar is slower. The process of refining or even cooking starts to break down complex carbohydrates into simple carbohydrates called malt (officially maltose), in effect predigesting them. When you eat simple carbohydrates you get a rapid increase in blood sugar level and a corresponding surge in energy. The surge, however, is followed by a drop as the body scrambles to balance your blood sugar level.





Balancing your blood sugar


Keeping your blood sugar balanced is probably the most important factor in maintaining even energy levels and weight. The level of glucose in your blood largely determines your appetite. When the level drops, you feel hungry. The glucose in your bloodstream is available to your cells to make energy. When the levels are too high, the body converts the excess to glycogen (a short-term fuel store mainly in the liver and muscle cells) or fat, our long-term energy reserve. When blood glucose levels are too low, we experience a whole host of symptoms including fatigue, poor concentration, irritability, nervousness, depression, sweating, headaches, and digestive problems. An estimated three in every ten people have impaired ability to keep their blood sugar level even. It may go too high, and then drop too low. The result, over the years, is that they become increasingly fat and lethargic. But if you can control your blood sugar levels, the result is even weight and constant energy.

Diabetes is an extreme form of blood sugar imbalance. This condition arises when the body can no longer produce sufficient insulin, a hormone that helps carry glucose out of the blood and into cells. The result is too much glucose in the blood and not enough for the cells. The early warning signs are similar to those of mild glucose imbalance, but they rarely go away as a result of simple dietary changes. One of the telltale signs is a continuous raging thirst as the body tries to dilute the excess blood sugar by stimulating us to drink.



Oats are more complex than glucose. Oats need digesting into single glucose units, which takes time and slows down the release of its sugars. This makes it slower releasing than sugar, which is a molecule of glucose and fructose that is slower in turn than a glucose molecule, which needs no digesting and directly enters the bloodstream.

Glucose-tolerance check

Answer the questions below, ticking those that you answer yes to. If you tick four or more, there is a strong possibility that your body is having difficulty keeping your blood sugar level even.

Are you rarely wide-awake within twenty minutes of rising?

Do you need a cup of tea or coffee, a cigarette, or something sweet to get you going in the morning?

Do you often feel drowsy or sleepy during the day or after meals?

Do you fall asleep in the early evening or need naps during the day?

Do you avoid exercise because you do not have the energy?

Do you get dizzy or irritable if you go six hours without food?

Is your energy level now less than it used to be?

Do you get night sweats or frequent headaches?



So what makes your blood sugar level unbalanced? The obvious answer is eating too much sugar and sweet foods. However, the kinds of foods that have the greatest effect are not always what you might expect.

The best way to achieve optimal blood sugar balance is to control the glycemic load, or what I call the “GL,” of your diet. This is way superior to “carbohydrate points” or the “glycemic index.” Put simply, the glycemic index (GI) of a food tells you whether the carbohydrate in the food is fast or slow releasing. It’s a quality measure. It doesn’t tell you, however, how much of the food is carbohydrate. Carbohydrate points or grams of carbohydrate tell you how much of the food is carbohydrate, but this doesn’t tell you what the particular carbohydrate does to your blood sugar. It’s a quantity measure. The glycemic load (GL) of a food is the quantity times the quality. The GL of a food is the best way of telling you how much weight you’ll gain if you choose a particular food.

Some foods that you eat a lot of, thinking they are good for you, have a high GL score so be ready for some surprises. Cornflakes and corn chips, for example, are very high, while ice cream and peanuts are not. One single date has the same effect on your blood sugar and weight as a small basket of strawberries.

As far as carbohydrates are concerned there are only two rules:

Rule 1: Eat no more than 50 GLs a day, 40 if you want to lose weight (10 per meal and 5 GLs each for two snacks).

Rule 2: For main meals eat low-GL carbohydrates with protein-rich foods.

It isn’t just about what you eat, it’s also about the quantity you eat, how you prepare it, what you eat it with—and what you drink. Let me give you an example.



Glycemic response: spaghetti. Within forty minutes of eating spaghetti, blood sugar levels are at a maximum. The body releases insulin to help get the glucose out of the blood and into body cells. Two hours later both blood glucose and insulin levels have returned to normal.

The graph above shows how blood sugar levels and insulin rise and fall after eating spaghetti. As the blood glucose level rises, the body produces insulin, and down it comes again.

In the graph on the next page, you can see what happens after eating bread. Now this particular bread and this spaghetti were made from the same flour, using the same amount of flour.13 So, in this case, the only difference is in the way it has been processed—in letting the dough rise and cooking it—and what it’s mixed with. Bread is made to rise by feeding yeast sugar, which makes bubbles, hence producing a lighter loaf. The bread is then cooked. Pasta is essentially wheat and some egg. It isn’t made to rise and isn’t cooked so long. Both contain the same amount of wheat, but this small difference in preparation makes a big difference in blood sugar response.

Notice that the blood sugar level not only peaks twice as high for bread as for pasta, but also dips twice as low. It’s the peaks that damage your arteries, making them less responsive to insulin, and the troughs that leave you tired, sleepy, and craving carbohydrates or stimulants. Again, you can see a massive increase in insulin release. In fact, almost four times as much insulin has been produced in the first two hours after eating! What this means is that bread will make you put on weight much more than pasta. It might sound hard to believe, but that is the truth.



Glycemic response: bread. Within forty minutes of eating bread, blood sugar levels are almost double those seen with spaghetti. The body produces more than three times as much insulin to bring blood glucose levels under control. The body overreacts and blood glucose goes to low, leading to strong cravings for something sweet or a stimulant such as caffeine, peaking three hours later.

Neither fat nor protein has any appreciable effect on blood sugar. Fat and protein can be converted into sugar, but not in the blood; hence their effect on your blood sugar level is negligible. In fact, I recommend you eat some fat and protein with your carbohydrate because this will further lessen the GL score of the carbohydrate you eat.





GL—beyond the glycemic index


It was the discovery that even quite similar foods could have very different effects on blood sugar that led to classifying foods as slow-releasing or fast-releasing carbohydrates. The fast-releasing foods are like rocket fuel, releasing their glucose in a sudden burst. They give a quick burst of energy with a rapid burnout.

But how do you know what is fast or slow releasing? The very measure of a food’s fast- or slow-releasing effect is linked to the degree to which it raises your blood sugar; this can be worked out on the aforementioned scale called the glycemic index (or GI for short). It involves measuring the level to which a food raises your blood glucose in relation to the effect glucose has.

If a food raises blood sugar level significantly, and for some time, the area under the curve made by glucose is great (as for bread, see figure on this page). Conversely, if a food hardly raises blood glucose levels at all, and only for a short time, the area under the curve is smaller (as for pasta, see figure on this page). The amount of food tested obviously affects how high the blood sugar level will go. The GI of a food is calculated by feeding a person however much of the food is needed to give 50 grams of carbohydrate. Below, you can see the glycemic index for a variety of foods. Generally, the high-GI foods are the ones to avoid, while the low-GI foods are the ones to eat. Some examples are given below. Here, apples and oats are slow releasing, while raisins and cornflakes are fast.

THE GLYCEMIC INDEX (GI) OF COMMON FOODS



The GI score of a food is very useful, but there’s one problem. Compare carrots with chocolate. Why do they have nearly the same scores? Wouldn’t you think intuitively that carrots would be good for you? You’d be dead right. The answer is that there is comparatively little carbohydrate in a carrot or a slice of watermelon. In fact, you’d have to eat seven carrots to get the same amount of carbohydrate, and the same effect on your weight, as 125 grams (4.4 oz) of chocolate would give you. This inconsistency is why the GI score of foods can be misleading.





Forget the GI—it’s the GL that counts


The GL score of a food—its glycemic load—solves this inconsistency. It’s a calculation based on the amount of carbohydrate in the food and its glycemic index. It takes both the quantity of carbohydrate in the food and the quality of the carbohydrate into account. This tells you exactly what a given serving of a food does to your blood sugar. See the chart in part 9 (this page–this page) to find out which foods have the lowest GLs.

You’ll see that oats are way better than any other cereal, whole-grain rye bread is much better than the others, brown basmati rice is much better than white rice, and whole wheat pasta is better than refined. Boiled potatoes are better than baked, while all peas, beans, and lentils have very low GLs. The best fruits are berries, plums, apples, and pears, while the worst are dates, raisins, and bananas.

When you eat carbohydrate foods with a low GL with protein foods, you stabilize your blood sugar level even more. Examples would be chicken with brown basmati rice, or salmon with whole wheat pasta, or a scrambled egg on whole rye toast. The fiber content of a food also lowers its GL, so I recommend high-fiber foods, from beans to brown rice. Lastly, when you eat is very important. It is better to graze, eating little and often, rather than gorge, as far as your blood sugar is concerned.





Breaking the habit


The taste for concentrated sweetness is often acquired in childhood. If sweet things are used as a reward or to cheer someone up, they become emotional comforters. The best way to break the habit is to avoid concentrated sweetness in the form of sugar, sweets, sweet desserts, dried fruit, and pure fruit juice. Instead, dilute fruit juice and get used to eating fruit instead of having a dessert. Sweeten breakfast cereals with fruit and have fruit instead of sweet snacks. If you gradually reduce the sweetness in your food, you will get used to the taste. Remember, we are designed to eat food that you can pick off a tree or pull out of the ground. Take a look at your average supermarket cart. Ever seen that stuff grow on trees?





Sugar alternatives


Alternatives to sugar, such as honey or maple syrup, are only marginally better. They both contain more minerals than refined sugar; however, most commercial honey is heated to make it more liquid so it can be cleaned up and put into jars. The heat turns honey’s natural sugar, levulose, into another, fast-releasing sugar more like glucose. If you like to eat honey, buy the untreated kind from local suppliers. Artificial sweeteners are not so great either. Some (admittedly in large quantities) have been shown to have harmful effects on health, and all perpetuate a sweet tooth. One of the best sugar alternatives is xylitol, a vegetable sugar that has a very low GL. It tastes much the same as regular sugar but has little effect on raising blood sugar—half that of fructose. Plums are rich in xylitol, which is part of the reason why they have a very low GL score.





Fiber


Not all types of carbohydrate can be digested and broken down into glucose. Indigestible carbohydrate is called fiber. This is a natural constituent of a healthy diet high in fruit, vegetables, lentils, beans, and whole grains, and, by eating a high-fiber diet containing these foods, you will be at less risk of bowel cancer, diabetes, and diverticular disease and unlikely to suffer from constipation.

Contrary to the popular image of fiber as “roughage,” it can absorb water. As it does so it makes fecal matter bulkier, less dense, and easier to pass along the digestive tract. This decreases the amount of time that food waste spends inside the body and reduces the risk of infection or cell changes due to carcinogens that are produced when some foods, particularly meat, degrade. A frequent meat eater with a low-fiber diet can increase the gut-transit time of food from twenty-four to seventy-two hours, giving time for some putrefaction to occur. So if you like meat, make sure you also eat high-fiber foods.

There are many different types of fiber, some of which are proteins and not carbohydrates. Some kinds, such as that found in oats, are called soluble fiber and combine with sugar molecules to slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. In this way, they help keep blood sugar levels balanced. Some fibers are much more water-absorbent than others. While wheat fiber swells to ten times its original volume in water, glucomannan fiber, from the Japanese konjac plant, swells to one hundred times its volume in water. By bulking up foods and releasing sugars slowly, highly absorbent types of fiber can help control appetite and play a part in weight maintenance.

An ideal intake of fiber is not less than 35 grams a day. Provided the right foods are eaten, this level can easily be achieved without adding extra fiber. Professor of nutrition John Dickerson from the University of Surrey (England) has stressed the danger of adding wheat bran to a nutrient-poor diet. The reason is that wheat bran contains high levels of phytate, an antinutrient that reduces the absorption of essential minerals, including zinc. Overall, it is probably best to get fiber from a mixture of sources such as oats, lentils, beans, seeds, fruit, and raw or lightly cooked vegetables. Much of the fiber in vegetables is destroyed by cooking, so they are best eaten crunchy.

To get enough of the right kinds of carbohydrates

Eat whole foods—whole grains, lentils, beans, nuts, seeds, fresh fruit, and vegetables—and avoid refined, and overcooked foods.

Eat five servings a day of dark green, leafy, and root vegetables, such as watercress, carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, spinach, green beans, and peppers, either raw or lightly cooked.

Eat three or more servings a day of fresh fruit, preferably apples, pears, or berries.

Eat four or more servings a day of legumes or whole grains such as rice, rye, oats, wheat, corn, quinoa whole-grain as cereal, or breads, or pasta.

Avoid any form of sugar, added sugar, and refined foods.

Dilute fruit juices and eat dried fruit only infrequently and in small quantities, preferably soaked.
