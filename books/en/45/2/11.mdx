title: 11. Stimulants—Are You Addicted?
---




Sugar is only one side of the coin, as far as blood sugar problems are concerned. Stimulants and stress are the other. As you can see from the figure on the next page, if your blood sugar level dips there are two ways to raise it. One is to eat more glucose, and the other is to increase your level of the stress hormones adrenaline and Cortisol. There are two ways in which you can raise adrenaline and Cortisol: consume a stimulant—tea, coffee, chocolate, or cigarettes—or react stressfully, causing an increase in your own production of adrenaline.

Knowing this, you can see how easy it is to get caught up in the vicious cycle of stress, sugar, and stimulants. It will leave you feeling tired, depressed, and stressed much of the time.

Here’s how it works. Through excess sugar, stress, and stimulants you lose your blood sugar control and wake up each morning with low blood sugar levels and not enough adrenaline to kick-start your day So you adopt one of two strategies:

Either you reluctantly crawl out of bed on remote control and head for the kettle, make yourself a strong cup of tea or coffee, light up a cigarette, or have some fast-releasing sugar in the form of toast, with some sugar on it called “jam.” Up go your blood sugar and adrenaline levels and you start to feel normal.

Or you lie in bed and start to think about all the things that have gone wrong, could go wrong, will go wrong. You start to worry about everything you’ve got to do, haven’t done, and should have done. About ten minutes of this gets enough adrenaline pumping to get you out of bed.



The sugar cycle. Eating sugar increases blood glucose levels. The body releases insulin into the blood to help escort glucose out of and into body cells to make energy or convert into fat. The result is low blood glucose. Either “real” stress, causing an increase in adrenaline, or stress induced by consuming a stimulant such as caffeine, which raises adrenal hormones, causes breakdown of stores of sugar in the liver and muscles, called glycogen, which raises blood sugar levels. Low blood glucose causes stress or cravings for either something sweet or a stimulant.

If this sounds like you, you’re caught in that vicious circle, with all its negative effects on your mind and mood.





Caffeine makes you tired


Here’s the irony. The reason that people get hooked on drinking coffee, particularly in the morning, is because it makes them feel better, more energized, and alert. But, wondered Dr. Peter Rogers, a psychologist at Bristol University in England, does coffee actually increase your energy and mental performance or just relieve the symptoms of withdrawal? When he researched this, he found that after that sacred cup of coffee, coffee drinkers don’t feel any better than people who never drink coffee. Coffee drinkers just feel better than they did when they woke up.14 In other words, drinking coffee relieves the symptoms of withdrawal from coffee. It’s addictive.

Not only is coffee addictive, but also it worsens mental performance. A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry looked at 1,500 psychology students and divided them into four categories depending on their coffee intake: abstainers, low consumers (one cup or equivalent a day), moderate (one to five cups a day), and high (five or more cups a day). The moderate and high consumers were found to have higher levels of anxiety and depression than the abstainers, and the high consumers had the greatest incidence of stress-related medical problems, as well as lower academic performance.15 A number of studies have shown that the ability to remember lists of words is reduced by caffeine. According to one researcher, “Caffeine may have a deleterious effect on the rapid processing of ambiguous or confusing stimuli.” That sounds like a description of modern living!

Caffeine blocks the receptors for a brain chemical called adenosine, whose function is to stop the release of the motivating neurotransmitters dopamine and adrenaline. With less adenosine activity, levels of dopamine and adrenaline increase, as does alertness and motivation. Peak concentration occurs thirty to sixty minutes after consumption.

The more caffeine you consume, the more your body and brain become insensitive to its own natural stimulants, dopamine and adrenaline. You then need more stimulants to feel normal and keep pushing the body to produce more dopamine and adrenaline. The net result is adrenal exhaustion—an inability to produce these important chemicals of motivation and communication. Apathy, depression, exhaustion, and an inability to cope set in.

Coffee isn’t the only source of caffeine. There’s as much in a cup of strong tea as in a cup of regular coffee. Caffeine is also the active ingredient in most cola and other energy drinks such as Red Bull, which sold over 100 million cans last year. Chocolate and green tea also contain caffeine, but much less than these drinks.





Kicking the habit


If you want to be in tip-top mental health, stay away from stimulants. This is doubly important for those with mental health problems because too much caffeine can, in some, produce symptoms that lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia or mania. This may happen because high caffeine consumers can become both allergic to coffee and unable to detoxify caffeine. The net effect is serious disruption of both mind and mood.16

Here’s how you can give up these stimulants.

Coffee contains three stimulants: caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Although caffeine is the strongest, theophylline is known to disturb normal sleep patterns, and theobromine has a similar effect to caffeine, although it is present in much smaller amounts in coffee. So decaffeinated coffee isn’t exactly stimulant free. As a nutritionist, I have seen many people cleared of minor health problems such as tiredness and headaches just from cutting out their two or three coffees a day. The best way to find out what effect it has on you is to quit for a trial period of two weeks. You may get withdrawal symptoms for up to three days. These reflect how addicted you’ve become. After this, if you begin to feel perky and your health improves, that’s a good indication that you’re better off without coffee. The most popular alternatives are Teeccino, Caro Extra, or Bambu (made with roasted chicory and malted barley) or herb teas.

Tea is the great British addiction. A cup of strong tea contains as much caffeine as a cup of regular coffee and is certainly addictive. Tea also contains tannin, which interferes with the absorption of essential minerals such as iron and zinc. Particularly addictive is Earl Grey tea containing bergamot, itself a stimulant. If you’re addicted to tea and can’t get going without a cup, it may be time to stop for two weeks and see how you feel. The best-tasting alternatives are Rooibos tea (red bush tea) with milk and herbal or fruit teas. Drinking very weak tea from time to time is unlikely to be a problem.

Chocolate bars are usually full of sugar. Cocoa, the active ingredient in chocolate, provides significant quantities of the stimulant theobromine, whose action is similar to caffeine’s, though not as strong. It also contains small amounts of caffeine. Theobromine is also obtained in cocoa drinks like hot chocolate. As chocolate is high in sugar and stimulants, and delicious as well, it’s all too easy to become a chocoholic. The best way to quit the habit is to have one month with no chocolate. Instead, eat healthy sweets from health food shops that are sugar free and don’t contain chocolate. After a month you will have lost the craving.

Cola and “energy” drinks contain anything from 46 to 80 mg of caffeine per can, which is as much as there is in a cup of coffee. In addition, these drinks are often high in sugar and colorings and their net stimulant effect can be considerable. Check the ingredients list and stay away from drinks containing caffeine and chemical additives or colorings.

Changing any food habit can be stressful in itself, so it is best not to quit everything in one go. A good strategy is to avoid something for a month and then see how you feel. One way to greatly reduce the cravings for foods you’ve got hooked on is by having an excellent diet. Since all stimulants affect blood sugar levels, you can keep yours even by always having something substantial for breakfast, such as an oat-based, not-too-refined cereal; unsweetened live yogurt with banana, ground sesame seeds, and wheat germ; or an egg. You can snack frequently on fresh fruit. The worst thing you can do is go for hours without eating. Eating a highly alkaline-forming diet can reduce cravings for cigarettes and alcohol. This means eating lots of fresh vegetables and fruit. These high-fiber foods also help keep your blood sugar level even.

As we will see in chapters 12 and 13, vitamins and minerals are important too, because they help regulate your blood sugar level and hence your appetite. They also minimize the effects of withdrawal from stimulants and the symptoms of food allergy. The key nutrients are vitamin C, the B complex vitamins, especially vitamin B6, and the minerals calcium, magnesium, and chromium. Fresh fruit and vegetables provide significant amounts of vitamin C and B vitamins, while vegetables and seeds such as sunflower and sesame are good sources of calcium and magnesium. For maximum effect, however, it is best to supplement these nutrients as well as eat foods rich in them.



ARE YOU DEPENDENT ON STIMULANTS?

To find out if you are stimulant-dependent, complete the “stimulant inventory” below, for a week.

Add up your total number of “units.” The ideal is five or fewer per week. If you are having more than ten stimulant units a week, this is going to have an effect on your mental well-being. If you score thirty or more this could well be contributing to mental health problems. It is strongly recommended that you reduce or avoid all these substances for at least a month and see how this helps your symptoms.

A few simple steps you can take to reduce your intake of and addiction to stimulants and balance your blood sugar

Avoid sugar and foods containing sugar.

Break your addiction to caffeine by avoiding coffee, tea, and caffeinated drinks for a month, while improving your diet. Once you are no longer craving caffeine, the occasional cup of weak tea or very occasional coffee is not a big deal.

Break your addiction to chocolate. Once you are no longer craving it, the occasional piece of chocolate is not a problem, but choose the dark, low-sugar kind.

Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner—choosing low-GL foods—plus two fruit snacks in between.

Take a high-strength multivitamin, plus 2,000 mg per day of vitamin C and 200 mcg of chromium.
