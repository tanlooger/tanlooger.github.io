title: 7. The Myth of the Well-Balanced Diet
---




A human being is made up of roughly 63 percent water, 22 percent protein, 13 percent fat, and 2 percent minerals and vitamins. Every single molecule comes from the food you eat and the water you drink. Eating the highest-quality food in the right quantities helps you achieve your highest potential for health, vitality, and freedom from disease.

Today’s diet has drifted a long way off the ideal intake and balance of nutrients. The pie charts on the next page show the percentage of calories we consume that come from fat, protein, and carbohydrate. While little overall change has occurred throughout 99 percent of humanity’s history, in the last hundred or so years, particularly the last three decades, we have started eating much more saturated fat and sugar and less starch (complex carbohydrates) and polyunsaturated fats. Even the government guidelines fall a long way short of our ancestors’ diets or what are generally considered to be ideal dietary guidelines.

Part of the problem is propaganda. We are led to believe that as long as you eat a well-balanced diet you get all the nutrients you need. Yet survey after survey has shown that even those who believe they eat a well-balanced diet fail to get anything like the ideal intake of vitamins, minerals, essential fats, and complex carbohydrates. It is not easy in today’s society, in which food production is inextricably linked to profit. Refining foods makes them last, which makes them more profitable but at the same time deficient in essential nutrients.

The food industry has gradually conditioned us to buy sugar-sweetened foods to the tune of 8.68 million tons of sugar a year—that’s 73 pounds per person per year! The U.S. consumption of sugar now approaches 25 percent of total calories. The World Health Organization recommends that no more than 10 percent of calories come from sugar, but does little to discourage us from eating it. Sugar sells, and the more of it we eat the less room there is for less sweet, “slow-releasing” carbohydrates. As our lives speed up, we spend less time preparing fresh food and become ever more reliant on prepared meals from companies more concerned about their profit than about our health.



Ancient and modern diets.

Since 1984, the Institute for Optimum Nutrition has been researching what a perfect diet would be. Our conclusions to date are shown in the top ten daily diet tips on this page. While for many people this kind of balance of foods is not going to be achievable overnight, it does give a clear indication of where your diet should be heading. The general guidelines, which are substantiated in later chapters, are as follows.





Fat


There are two basic kinds of fat: saturated (hard) fat and unsaturated fat. It is neither essential to eat saturated fat nor ideal to eat too much. The main sources are meat and dairy products. There are also two kinds of unsaturated fat: monounsaturated fats, of which olive oil is a rich source; and polyunsaturated fats, found in nut and seed oils and fish.

Certain polyunsaturated fats, called linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid or omega-6 and omega-3 oils, are essential for the brain and nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, and skin. A common sign of deficiency of these substances is dry skin. The optimal diet provides a balance of these two essential fats. Pumpkin and flax seeds are rich in linolenic acid (omega-3), while sesame and sunflower seeds are rich in linoleic acid (omega-6). Linolenic acid is converted in the body into DHA (docoso-hexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), which are also found in mackerel, herring, salmon, and tuna. These essential fats are easily destroyed by heating or exposure to oxygen, so having a fresh daily source is important. Processed foods often contain hardened or “hydrogenated” polyunsaturated fats. These are worse for you than saturated fat and are best avoided.

Eat one tablespoon of cold-pressed seed oil (sesame, sunflower, pumpkin, flaxseed, and so on) or one heaping tablespoon of ground seeds a day.

Avoid fried food, burnt or browned fat, saturated and hydrogenated fat.





Protein


The twenty-five amino acids—the compounds that make up protein—are the building blocks of the body. As well as being essential for growth and the repair of body tissue, they are used to make hormones, enzymes, antibodies, and neurotransmitters and help transport substances around the body. Both the quality of the protein you eat, determined by the balance of these amino acids, and the quantities you eat are important.

The USDA recommends that we obtain 15 percent of our total calorie intake from protein, but gives little guidance as to the kind of protein. The average breast-fed baby receives just 1 percent of its total calories from protein and manages to double its birth weight in six months. This is because the protein from breast milk is of a very good quality and easily absorbed. Assuming good-quality protein, 10 percent of calorie intake, or around 35 grams of protein a day, is an optimal intake for most adults, unless pregnant, recovering from surgery, or undertaking large amounts of exercise or heavy manual work.

The current diet trend toward high protein (30 percent of calories), high fat (50 percent of calories), and low carbohydrate (20 percent of calories) provides way more protein than the body needs, let alone fat, and taxes the kidneys heavily.

The best-quality protein foods in terms of amino acid balance include eggs, quinoa, soybeans, meat, fish, beans, and lentils. Animal protein sources tend to contain a lot of undesirable saturated fat. Vegetable protein sources tend to contain additional beneficial complex carbohydrates and are less acid forming (see page the chart in part 9) than meat. It is best to limit meat to three meals a week. It is difficult not to take in enough protein from any diet that includes three meals a day whether vegan, vegetarian, or including meat. Many vegetables, especially “seed” foods like runner beans, peas, corn, and broccoli, contain good levels of protein and help neutralize excess acidity, which can lead to losses of minerals, including calcium—hence the higher risk of osteoporosis among frequent meat eaters.

Eat two daily servings of beans, lentils, quinoa, tofu (soy), “seed” vegetables (such as peas or fava beans), or other vegetable protein, or one small serving of meat, fish, or cheese, or a free-range egg.

Avoid too much animal protein.





Carbohydrate


The main fuel for the body, carbohydrate, comes in two forms: fast releasing, as in sugar, honey, malt, sweets, and most refined foods, and slow releasing, as in whole grains, vegetables, and fresh fruit. The latter foods contain more complex carbohydrate and/or more fiber, both of which help slow down the release of sugar. Fast-releasing carbohydrates tend to give a sudden burst of energy followed by a slump, while slow-releasing carbohydrates provide more sustained energy and are therefore preferable.

Refined foods like sugar and white flour lack the vitamins and minerals needed for the body to use them properly and are best avoided. The perpetual use of fast-releasing carbohydrates can give rise to complex symptoms and health problems. Some fruits, like bananas, dates, and raisins, contain faster-releasing sugars and are best kept to a minimum by people with glucose-related health problems. Slow-releasing carbohydrate foods—fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains—should make up two-thirds of what you eat, or around 65 percent of your total calorie intake. Every day, aim to:

Eat three or more servings of dark green, leafy, and root vegetables, such as watercress, carrots, sweet potatoes, Broccolini, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, spinach, green beans, or peppers, raw or lightly cooked.

Eat three or more servings of fresh fruit, such as apples, pears, bananas, berries, melon, or citrus fruit.

Eat four or more servings of legumes or whole grains such as rice, millet, rye, oats, whole wheat, corn, quinoa or whole-grain bread, or pasta.

Avoid any form of sugar, foods with added sugar, or refined foods.





Fiber


Rural Africans eat about 55 grams of dietary fiber a day compared with the UK average intake of 15 grams, and have the lowest incidence of bowel diseases such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, colitis, and bowel cancer. The ideal intake is not less than 35 grams a day. It is easy to take in this amount of fiber—which absorbs water in the digestive tract, making the food contents bulkier and easier to pass through the body—by eating whole grains, vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, lentils, and beans on a daily basis. Fruit and vegetable fiber slows down the absorption of sugar into the blood, helping to maintain good energy levels. Cereal fiber is particularly good at preventing constipation and putrefaction of food, which are underlying causes of many digestive complaints. Diets high in refined foods that are oriented toward meat, eggs, fish, and dairy products will undoubtedly lack fiber.

Eat whole foods—whole grains, lentils, beans, nuts, seeds, fresh fruit, and vegetables.

Avoid refined, and overcooked foods.





Water


Two-thirds of the body consists of water, which is therefore our most important nutrient. The body loses three pints of water a day through the skin, lungs, and gut and via the kidneys as urine, ensuring that toxic substances are eliminated from the body. We also make about a third of a quart of water a day when glucose is “burned” for energy. Therefore, our minimum water intake from food and drink needs to be more than one quart a day. The ideal daily intake is around two quarts. This is best achieved by drinking eight glasses of water a day, including hot drinks.

Fruit and vegetables consist of around 90 percent water. They supply it in a form that is very easy for the body to use, at the same time providing the body with a high percentage of its vitamins and minerals. Four pieces of fruit and four servings of vegetables, amounting to about thirty-nine ounces of these foods, can provide a quart of water, leaving a daily one quart to be taken as water or in the form of diluted juices or herb or fruit teas. Alcohol acts as a diuretic and causes considerable losses of vitamins and minerals, so it doesn’t count in this regard.

Drink six to eight glasses of water a day as water or in diluted juices or herb or fruit teas.

Minimize your intake of alcohol, coffee, and tea.

The nutritional benefits of water are explained more fully in chapter 18.





Vitamins


Although needed in much smaller amounts than fat, protein, or carbohydrate, vitamins are no less important. They “turn on” enzymes, which in turn make all body processes happen. Vitamins are needed to balance hormones, produce energy, boost the immune system, make healthy skin, and protect the arteries; they are vital for the brain, nervous system, and just about every body process. Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants; they slow down the aging process and protect the body from cancer, heart disease, and pollution. B and C vitamins are vital for turning food into mental and physical energy. Vitamin D, found in milk, eggs, fish, and meat, helps control calcium balance. It can also be made in the skin in the presence of sunshine. B and C vitamins are most abundant in fresh fruit and vegetables. Vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, the animal form found in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products; and beta-carotene, found in red, yellow, and orange fruit and vegetables. Vitamin E is found in seeds, nuts, and their oils and helps protect essential fats from going rancid.

Eat three or more servings of dark green, leafy, and root vegetables, and three or more servings of fresh fruit, plus some nuts or seeds, every day.

Supplement a multivitamin containing at least the following: vitamin A 5,000 IU, vitamin D 200 IU, vitamin E 100 IU, vitamin B1 25 mg, vitamin B2 25 mg, vitamin B3 (niacin) 50 mg, vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) 50 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, vitamin B12 10 mcg, folic acid 200 mcg, biotin 50 mcg. Also supplement 1,000 mg of vitamin C a day.

The nutritional benefits of vitamins are explained more fully in chapter 12.





Minerals


Like vitamins, minerals are essential for just about every body process. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus help make up the bones and teeth. Nerve signals, vital for the brain and muscles, depend on calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Oxygen is carried in the blood by an iron compound. Chromium helps control blood sugar levels. Zinc is essential for all body repair, renewal, and development. Selenium and zinc help boost the immune system. Brain function depends on adequate magnesium, manganese, zinc, and other essential minerals. These are but a few of thousands of key roles that minerals play in human health.

We need large daily amounts of calcium and magnesium, which are found in vegetables such as kale, cabbage, and root vegetables. They are also abundant in nuts and seeds. Calcium alone is found in large quantities in dairy products. Fruit and vegetables provide lots of potassium and small amounts of sodium, which is the right balance. All “seed” foods—which include seeds, nuts, lentils, and dried beans, as well as peas, fava beans, runner beans, and whole grains—are good sources of iron, zinc, manganese, and chromium. Selenium is abundant in nuts, seafood, seaweed, and seeds, especially sesame.

Eat one serving of mineral-rich foods such as kale, cabbage, root vegetables, low-fat dairy products (such as yogurt), seeds, or nuts, as well as plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole foods such as lentils, beans, and whole grains.

Supplement a multimineral containing at least the following: calcium 100 mg, magnesium 100 mg, iron 10 mg, zinc 10 mg, manganese 2.5 mg, chromium 25 mcg, selenium 25 mcg.

The nutritional benefits of minerals are explained more in chapter 13.





Pure food


Organic, unadulterated whole foods have formed the basis of the human diet through the ages. Only in the twentieth century did we begin to be subjected to countless man-made chemicals in food and in the environment.

One foundation for health is to eat foods that provide exactly the amount of energy required to keep the body in perfect balance. A good deal of energy is wasted in trying to disarm these alien and often toxic chemicals, some of which cannot be eliminated and so accumulate in body tissue. It is now impossible to avoid all these substances, as there is nowhere on this planet that is not contaminated in some way as a result of the by-products of our modern chemical age. Choosing organic foods whenever possible is the nearest we can get to eating a pure diet today. By supporting the movement back to these kinds of foods we are helping to minimize the damage of chemical pollution, which poses a real threat to the future of humanity.

Eating raw, organic food is the most natural and beneficial way to take food into the body. Many foods contain enzymes that help digest them once chewed. Raw food is full of vital phytochemicals (see chapter 17), whose effects on our health may prove as important as those of vitamins and minerals. Cooking food destroys enzymes and reduces the activity of phytochemicals.

Eat organic as much as you can. Make sure that at least half your diet consists of raw fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.

Avoid processed food with additives, and cook food as little as possible.
