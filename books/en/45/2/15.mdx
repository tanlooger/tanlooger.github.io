title: 15. Antioxidants—The Power of Prevention
---




Since the 1980s, more and more research has confirmed that many of the twentieth century’s most common diseases are associated with a shortage of antioxidant nutrients and helped by their supplementation. So important is the role of antioxidants that medical science is beginning to consider the presence of any one of the diseases listed below as a sign of probable antioxidant deficiency, in the same way that scurvy is a sign of vitamin C deficiency.

In the future, we may be tested for blood levels of antioxidant nutrients alongside levels of blood sugar and cholesterol and blood pressure. Capable of predicting your biological age and expected life span, your antioxidant-nutrient status may prove to be your most vital statistic.





PROBABLE ANTIOXIDANT-DEFICIENCY DISEASES

Alzheimer’s disease Macular (eye lens) degeneration

Cancer Measles

Cardiovascular disease Mental illness

Cataracts Periodontal (tooth) disease

Diabetes Respiratory tract infections

Hypertension Rheumatoid arthritis

Infertility



The common denominator in the process of aging and its associated diseases is called oxidative damage. This has put the spotlight on the use of antioxidants—nutrients that help protect the body from this damage by preventing and treating disease. So far, over a hundred antioxidant nutrients have been discovered and hundreds, if not thousands, of research papers have extolled their benefits. The main players are vitamins A, C, and E, plus beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A that is found in fruit and vegetables. Their presence in your diet and levels in your blood may prove to be the best marker yet of your power to delay death and prevent disease.





What is an antioxidant?


Oxygen is the basis of all plant and animal life. It is our most important nutrient, needed by every cell every second of every day. Without it we cannot release the energy in food that drives all body processes. But oxygen is chemically reactive and highly dangerous: in normal biochemical reactions oxygen can become unstable and capable of “oxidizing” neighboring molecules. This can lead to cellular damage that triggers cancer, inflammation, arterial damage, and aging. Known as free oxidizing radicals, this bodily equivalent of nuclear waste must be disarmed to remove the danger. Free radicals are made in all combustion processes including smoking, the burning of gasoline to create exhaust fumes, radiation, frying or barbecuing food, and normal body processes. Chemicals capable of disarming free radicals are called antioxidants. Some are known essential nutrients, like vitamin A and beta-carotene, and vitamins C and E. Others, like bioflavonoids, anthocyanidins, pyenogenol, and over a hundred other recently identified protectors found in common foods, are not.

The balance between your intake of antioxidants and your exposure to free radicals may be the balance between life and death. You can tip the scales in your favor by making simple changes to your diet and by antioxidant supplementation.





Antioxidants in health and disease


Slowing down the aging process is no longer a mystery. The best results in research studies have consistently been achieved by giving animals low-calorie diets high in antioxidant nutrients—in other words, exactly what they need and no more. This reduces “oxidative stress” and ensures maximum antioxidant protection. Animals fed in this way not only live up to 40 percent longer, but also are more active during their lives. Although long-term studies have yet to be completed, there is every reason to assume that the same principles apply to humans. Already, large-scale surveys show that the risk of death is substantially reduced in those with either high levels of antioxidants in their blood or high dietary intakes.



Burnt foods harm the body. Free radicals, or oxidants, from anything burnt, damage the body resulting in ageing and disease and are disarmed by antioxidant nutrients. In this diagram, GP stands for the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and SOD is the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.

Conversely, a lower level of vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The blood levels of vitamin E and beta-carotene in sufferers are half those of elderly people who do not have Alzheimer’s.46 A U.S. study gave 633 disease-free sixty-five-year-olds large amounts of either vitamin E or vitamin C. A small number in each group would have been expected to show the signs of AD five years later. None did.47 Another study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the risk of developing AD was 67 percent lower in those with a high dietary intake of vitamin E than in those with a low intake.48

Elderly people with low levels of vitamin C in their blood have eleven times the risk of developing cataracts compared with those with high levels.49 Similarly, those with low vitamin E blood levels have almost double the risk, while people consuming 450 IU of vitamin E a day have half the risk of developing cataracts.50 51

Levels of vitamin A are consistently found to be low in people with lung cancer. In fact, having a low vitamin A level doubles the risk of lung cancer. Similarly, a high intake of beta-carotene from raw fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking men and women.52 In one study, giving a 8,300 IU per day supplement of beta-carotene resulted in 71 percent of patients with oral precancer (leukoplakia) improving, while 57 percent of patients given 200,000 IU of vitamin A per day had complete remission.53 Beta-carotene on its own, however, may not be wise to supplement if you are a smoker (see this page).

Supplementing vitamins E and C effectively halves the risk of ever having a heart attack, while in a massive study on nurses, those who consumed 15 to 5,500 IU of beta-carotene per day had a 40 percent lower risk of a stroke and a 22 percent lower risk of a heart attack compared with those consuming only 1,600 IU per day.54 Those with high dietary intakes of beta-carotene had half the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Supplementing 1,000 mg of vitamin C also reduces blood pressure.55

Antioxidants also help boost your immune system and increase your resistance to infection. In children, regular supplementation of vitamin A significantly reduces respiratory tract infections. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce the symptoms of AIDS and, in a small number of cases, to reverse the condition. They increase fertility, reduce inflammation in arthritis, and have key roles to play in many conditions, including colds and chronic fatigue syndrome. (For more information on specific diseases see part 7.)





The synergy of antioxidants is vital


As we saw in the chart on this page, antioxidants are team players. You need a combination of vitamins E and C and beta-carotene, as well as glutathione, anthocyanidins, lipoic acid, and coenzyme Q10, to do the job of disarming oxidants properly Taking only one of these antioxidants not only is unwise, but also could be dangerous. While more than two hundred studies have shown that beta-carotene reduces your risk for a variety of cancers, three studies have shown that supplementing beta-carotene on its own can raise the risk of cancer, although only if you smoke. Why the apparent contradiction?

Let’s examine the most recent negative trial, conducted by the National Cancer Institute. They divided people with a history of colorectal tumors into four groups. One group was given 6,900 IU of beta-carotene, a second group was given 100 mg of vitamin C and 600 IU of vitamin E, a third group received the beta-carotene and vitamins C and E, and the fourth group received a placebo. While there was less recurrence of colorectal tumors in the first three groups, there was a modest increase in cancer recurrence among those who took only beta-carotene supplements and both smoked and drank alcohol every day.

Does this mean that beta-carotene is a moralistic vitamin, adding risk to those who both smoke and drink, but saving those who don’t? Of course not. What is almost certainly happening here is that the oxidants in cigarettes are oxidizing beta-carotene and, in the absence of other synergistic vitamins such as vitamin C and E, this does more harm than good. My advice is to quit the cigarettes, eat foods high in antioxidants including beta-carotene, and supplement either a multivitamin containing antioxidants or a good, all-round antioxidant formula. I take both.





Testing your antioxidant potential


Your ability to stay free of these diseases depends on the balance between your intake of harmful free radicals and your intake of protective antioxidants. As the scales start to tip away from health, early warning signs start to develop, such as frequent infections, difficulty shaking an infection, easy bruising, slow healing, thinner skin, or excessive wrinkles for your age.

Another sign of impaired antioxidant status is a reduced ability to detoxify the body after an onslaught of free radicals. So, for example, if you feel groggy or achy after a burst of exercise or after exposure to pollution (such as being stuck in a traffic jam or a room full of cigarette smoke), your antioxidant potential may need a boost.

A more accurate way to determine your antioxidant status is to have a biochemical antioxidant profile done. This blood test measures the levels of beta-carotene and vitamins C and E in your blood and determines how well your antioxidant enzyme systems (such as glutathione peroxidase) are functioning. Most nutritional laboratories offer this kind of test. A less expensive and less extensive total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP) test is also available. But while this will indicate if there is an antioxidant problem, it will not define which nutrients are missing. Ask your doctor or nutritionist about these tests, as they are rarely available directly to the public.





Antioxidants—the best foods


Every year more and more antioxidants are found in nature, including substances in berries, grapes, tomatoes, mustard, and broccoli, and in herbs such as turmeric and ginkgo biloba. These substances, such as bioflavonoids, lycopene, and anthocyanidins, are not essential nutrients but are highly beneficial. They are classified as phytochemicals and are discussed fully in chapter 17.

21+. This is a bad score, putting you in the high-risk group for rapid aging. See a nutritionist and ask for an antioxidant profile blood test. You will need to make changes to your diet and lifestyle, plus supplementing antioxidants, to reverse or slow down the aging process.



The main essential antioxidant vitamins are A, C, and E and the precursor of vitamin A, beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is found in red/orange/yellow vegetables and fruits. Vitamin C is also abundant in vegetables and fruit eaten raw, but heat rapidly destroys it. Vitamin E is found in “seed” foods, including nuts, seeds and their oils, and vegetables like peas, fava beans, corn, and whole grains—all of which are classified as seed foods. The best all-round foods are shown in the table on the next page. Eating sweet potatoes, carrots, watercress, peas, and broccoli frequently is a great way to increase your antioxidant potential—provided, of course, that you do not fry them.

Thanks to groundbreaking research at Tufts University in Boston, there’s a new way to rate a food’s overall antioxidant power. Each food can now be assigned a certain number of ORAC units (short for “oxygen radical absorbance capacity”). Foods that score high in these units are especially helpful in countering oxidant, or free radical, damage in your body.

Top-scoring foods include prunes, raisins, blueberries, and blackberries. Other top-scoring foods include kale, spinach, strawberries, raspberries, plums, broccoli, and alfalfa spouts. These and other fresh fruits and vegetables are the kinds of foods you need to eat every day to keep young and energetic. (See the chart below for the ORAC ratings for several foods. You can find a more comprehensive listing of ORAC ratings in part 9)

We should all obtain 3,500 ORAC units a day, although 5,000 to 6,000 will give you even more protection against aging. You’ll also be better protected against many diseases, including cancer and heart disease. What this means in practice is eating a cup of blueberries (3,240 ORAC units), a quarter of a cup of raisins, and three prunes; or a half-pint of strawberries and two servings of kale, Broccolini, or broccoli. Alternatively, you could eat five servings of fresh fruit and vegetables every day.

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH ANTIOXIDANT POWER





The best fruits are berries. Another great antioxidant fruit is watermelon. The flesh is high in beta-carotene and vitamin C, while the seeds are high in vitamin E and in the antioxidant minerals zinc and selenium. You can make a great antioxidant cocktail by blending the flesh and seeds into a great-tasting drink. Seeds and seafood are the best all-round dietary sources of selenium and zinc.

Including vegetables such as Broccolini, broccoli, spinach, and avocado in your diet on a regular basis is another great way to up your antioxidant intake. The amino acids cysteine and glutathione also act as antioxidants. They help make one of the body’s key antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase, which is itself dependent on selenium. This enzyme helps detoxify the body, protecting us against car exhaust fumes, carcinogens, infections, too much alcohol, and toxic metals. Cysteine and glutathione are particularly high in white meat, tuna, lentils, beans, nuts, seeds, onions, and garlic, and have been shown to boost the immune system as well as to increase antioxidant power.





Supplementary benefit


Given the unquestionable value of increasing your antioxidant status, it is wise to make sure that your daily supplement program contains significant quantities of antioxidants, especially if you are middle-aged or older, live in a polluted city, or suffer any other unavoidable exposure to free radicals. The easiest way to do this is to take a comprehensive antioxidant supplement. Most reputable supplement companies produce formulas containing a combination of the following nutrients: vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, selenium, glutathione, and cysteine, plus plant-based antioxidants like bilberry or pyenogenol. Also important are lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).

Lipoic acid is a sulfur-containing, vitamin-like substance that has very effective antioxidant properties. As an antioxidant, it is particularly useful because it is one of the few that is both water- and fat-soluble, which means that it can protect a wider range of molecules than, say, just vitamin C or vitamin E. Foods said to be high in lipoic acid are liver and brewer’s yeast. CoQ10 is a vital antioxidant helping protect cells from carcinogens and also helping recycle vitamin E. CoQ10’s magical properties lie in its ability to improve the cell’s use of oxygen. CoQ10 works by controlling the flow of oxygen, making the production of energy most efficient and preventing damage caused by these oxidants. CoQ10 is found in meat, fish, nuts, and seeds.

The kind of total supplementary intake (which may come in part from a multivitamin and extra vitamin C) to aim for is shown below:



Vitamin A (retinol/beta-carotene) 7500 IU to 20,000 IU

Glutathione (reduced) 25 mg to 75 mg

Vitamin E 100 IU to 500 IU

Vitamin C 1,000 mg to 3,000 mg

CoQ10 10 mg to 50 mg

Lipoic acid 10 mg to 50 mg

Anthocyanidin 50 mg to 250 mg

Selenium 30 mcg to 100 mcg

Zinc 10 mg to 20 mg



Simple tips for improving your antioxidant potential and boosting your power of prevention

Eat lots of fresh fruit, especially berries.

Eat lots of vegetables, especially Broccolini, spinach, avocado, sweet potatoes, carrots, peas, watercress, and broccoli.

Take a multivitamin and/or a good antioxidant supplement daily containing all the above nutrients.

Do your best to avoid pollution, smoky places, direct exposure to strong sunlight, and fried foods.

Don’t overexercise or exercise beyond your aerobic potential.
