title: 17. Living Food—The Phytochemical Revolution
---




Every time you eat a natural food, for example, a piece of broccoli, you are receiving a cocktail of a vast number of active compounds that will influence your health for the better. Some of these, as we’ve seen, are classified as vitamins, minerals, essential fats, or amino acids. However, there are many more substances that play a very important part in your health. These are called phytochemicals (phyton means “plant” in Greek) and have a major impact on our body systems, helping to promote health and prevent disease.

Phytochemicals are biologically active compounds in food; they are not classified as nutrients, in that our lives do not depend on them as they do on vitamins. However, they do play a vital role in the body’s biochemistry in ways that affect our health as significantly as vitamins and minerals. In this sense, they are best thought of as semiessential nutrients. As they are not stored in the body, it is best to eat foods rich in phytochemicals on a regular basis. Over a hundred phytochemicals have been identified, some of which act as antioxidants, immune system boosters, and hormone stabilizers. Listed below are those with proven health benefits.

Curcumin Lycopene Zeanxanthin



Now let’s take a look at how some of these phytochemicals can support your health.





Phytochemicals—nature’s pharmacy


Allium compounds: Members of the Allium genus include garlic, onions, leeks, chives, and shallots. Garlic has long been renowned as a health food, with many benefits attributed to it. Though it is rich in many vitamins and minerals, the main active ingredients seem to be sulfur compounds. These include allicin, allixin, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide.

Studies from China show that people who eat a lot of garlic are protected against stomach cancer.64 This may be because garlic is able to block the conversion of nitrites and nitrates (found in many preserved foods) into cancer-causing nitrosamines. Garlic can also inhibit the action of aflatoxins, which are naturally occurring substances found in peanuts and other foods, which can cause cancer. The results of a large study involving 41,837 women from Iowa aged between fifty-five and sixty-nine indicated that garlic was the most protective type of vegetable against colon cancer. Women who said they ate garlic at least once a week were 50 percent less likely to contract colon cancer than those who said they never ate it.65 By acting as an antioxidant, garlic helps prevent both cancer and heart disease.

Garlic significantly lowers cholesterol in the blood and prevents atherosclerosis. A three-year study at Tagore Medical College in India divided over four hundred patients who had already suffered heart attacks into two groups. One group was given garlic supplements (equal to six to ten cloves per day)—they suffered fewer heart attacks and had significantly lower cholesterol counts than those who did not take garlic.66 Garlic also helps prevent blood clots—probably a safer way to maintain thin blood than taking an aspirin a day, which can cause stomach bleeding.

Anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins: These are particularly plentiful in berries and grapes. These are types of bioflavonoids (see below), reputedly good against gout and certain types of arthritis.

Bioflavonoids: These have a number of beneficial roles. They act as potent antioxidants; they can bind to toxic metals and escort them out of the body; they have a synergistic effect on vitamin C, stabilizing it in human tissue; they have a bacteriostatic and/or antibiotic effect, which accounts for their anti-infection properties; and they are also anticarcinogenic. They are used to deal with capillary fragility, bleeding gums, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, bruises, strain injuries, and thrombosis. Bioflavonoids include rutin (lots in buckwheat) and hesperidin, found particularly in citrus fruits. The best food sources are rosehips, buckwheat leaves, citrus fruit, berries, broccoli, cherries, grapes, papaya, cantaloupe melon, plums, tea, red wine, and tomatoes. There are also special bioflavonoids in cucumbers that stop cancer-causing hormones from binding to cells.

Boswellic acid: This is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, and therefore helpful with conditions such as arthritis; it is found in the herb frankincense.

Capsaicin: Abundant in hot peppers, it helps protect DNA from damage.

Carotenoids: As the name implies, carotenoids—one type of which is beta-carotene—are plentiful in carrots. They are also abundant in other fruit and vegetables including sweet potato, watercress, and peas. They act as important antiaging antioxidants.

Chlorophyll: This is the substance that makes green plants green. Chlorophyll-rich foods like wheat grass, algae, seaweeds, and green vegetables help “build” the blood. Vitamins C, B12, B6, A, K, and folic acid are among the nutrients needed to keep blood healthy. Research has shown that components of chlorophyll found in foods, when fed in very small, purified amounts, may stimulate the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Chlorophyll has been shown to help protect against cancer and certain forms of radiation, to kill germs, and to act as a powerful wound healer. Cereal grasses have the nutrient profile of a dark green vegetable rather than that of a grain, so they are gluten-free and safe for those who have celiac disease (due to allergy to gluten).

Coumarins and chlorogenic acid: These substances prevent the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines and are found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, green peppers, pineapple, strawberries, and carrots.

Curcumin: A powerful antioxidant found in mustard, turmeric, corn, and yellow peppers.

Ellagic acid: Present in strawberries, grapes, and raspberries, ellagic acid neutralizes carcinogens before they can damage DNA. A common cancer-producing chemical found in some meat, called nitrosamine, is put out of action by strawberries. In fact, research has shown that strawberries are second only to garlic for their anticancer properties against nitrosamines.67 One of the reasons, apart from their high antioxidant levels, that strawberries and raspberries come out on top is that they are very high in ellagic acid, also an anticancer nutrient. According to research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, ellagic acid in strawberries and raspberries protects healthy cells from developing into cancer cells.68 Ellagic acid also protects you from another common carcinogen, aflatoxin.69 This is found in low levels in a number of foods, including peanuts.

Genistein: Abundant in soybeans, this substance, a type of phytoestrogen (see below), prevents breast, prostate, and other lumps from growing and spreading. Research is beginning to focus on two isoflavonoids—genistein and daidzein. Japanese women, who generally have a lower risk of breast cancer than women in other industrialized societies, have been found to have higher levels of these in their bodies. They may protect against the harmful effects of unopposed estrogen. In fact, a recent study from Singapore, which monitored a group of women for early signs of breast cancer, found that the more soy a woman ate, the less chance there was of her having precancer changes in her breast cells.

A likely ideal intake for cancer prevention is around 5 mg a day of genistein and daidzein, which you can get from a 12 oz. serving of soy milk or a serving of tofu. Soy milk can be used in drinks and on cereal like cow’s milk, while tofu is excellent in stir-fries. Tofu is the richest source of isoflavones, while very processed soy products are the poorest source. However, I don’t advise having much more than this. Even plant estrogens could, theoretically, be estrogenic in excess, and you can develop allergies to soy if you eat too much of it.

Glucosinolates: These are one of the most important anticancer and liver-friendly nutrients found in food. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, there’s convincing evidence that foods high in glucosinolates reduce risk for lung cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, and probably breast cancer. That’s why broccoli is considered so good for you. Broccolini is by far the richest source discovered, followed by broccoli and Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables. Glucosinolates have this profound anticancer effect by helping the liver detoxify.

In an ingenious study, volunteers were given Brussels sprouts that had their glucosinolates removed, versus regular Brussels sprouts. Those eating the regular Brussels sprouts had 30 percent more active liver enzyme function, showing just how powerful glucosinolates are for boosting your ability to detoxify.

Isothiocyanates (ITCs) and indoles: These are plentiful in cruciferous vegetables, which include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, cress, horseradish, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, radishes, and turnips. One of the highest food sources is Broccolini, which is a cross between kale and broccoli. Strawberries and raspberries are another rich source.

Eating fruit or vegetables rich in ITCs is now linked to a lower incidence of cancer, particularly of the colon. Research has shown that if you eat cabbage more than once a week, you are only one-third as likely to develop colon cancer as someone who never eats cabbage. This means that one serving of cabbage a week could cut your chances of colon cancer by 60 percent. Both broccoli and Brussels sprouts also show a dose-dependent protective response against cancer. Isiothiocyanates don’t just help prevent cancer; they reverse it by killing cancer cells. Strawberries and raspberries, for example, have been shown to inhibit cancer development in cervical,70 esophageal,71 and oral cancer,72 and probably prostate cancer.

Lentinan: Two species of mushrooms, shiitake and reishi, are rich sources of this powerful anticancer agent. In animal studies, it has shown antitumor properties. Lentinan is widely used in Japanese hospitals to treat cancer. It also induces the production of interferon, the body’s own antiviral chemical used to fight off infection. Other research suggests that lentinan may have potential in the fight against AIDS. It has demonstrated anti-HIV activity, and in one U.S. study, 30 percent of patients taking lentinan who were HIV positive showed an increase in their T-cell counts after twelve weeks.

Lignans: These are part of the group of compounds known as phytoestrogens (see below), plant substances that can induce biological responses in the body. They do this by mimicking the actions of the body’s own estrogens, usually by binding to the estrogen receptors. They are ingested as inactive compounds and then activated by the gut microflora. The main source of lignans is flaxseeds and they are also found in beans, nuts, fruit, and cereals in smaller quantities.

Lutein: This is a powerful antioxidant found in many fruits and vegetables. It is remarkably heat stable and can survive cooking. A recent study by the Florida International University found that people whose eyes contained higher amounts of lutein were up to 80 percent less likely to be suffering from age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), a condition that includes cataracts. Lutein protects the eye by forming pigments in the macula—the part of the eye right behind the lens in the center of the retina. These pigments help with vision by filtering out harmful blue light wavelengths that can damage the eye. The more pigments your eye contains, the less likely it is to fall prey to ARMD.

As the body does not naturally generate lutein, you need to make sure you are getting enough from other sources. The best are green, leafy vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating a teaspoon of green, leafy vegetables (with a small amount of fat) raised blood lutein levels by nearly 90 percent.

Lycopene: This is a powerful antioxidant with anticancer properties, found in tomatoes.73 Tomatoes also contain many other antioxidants. Lycopene in tomatoes becomes considerably more bioavailable when you juice, mash, or cook the tomatoes. Lycopene is also found in other red foods, including watermelon. It’s worth eating something red most days.

Phenols: These are potent antioxidants particularly plentiful in green tea. These substances have been investigated for their cancer-protective effects, which have been found to be even more powerful than those in vitamins C and E. It’s believed that green tea consumption in Japan, which averages about three cups a day, is partly responsible for the low levels of cancer found in that country.

Phytoestrogens: These substances play a protective role by binding excess estrogens, made in the body or taken in from the environment via pesticides, plastics, and other sources of estrogen-like chemicals, to a protein made in the blood. This action reduces the amount of estrogens available to estrogen-sensitive tissues. Foods rich in phytoestrogens include soy, particularly in the forms tofu and miso, other legumes, citrus fruits, wheat, licorice, alfalfa, fennel, and celery. A high intake of phytoestrogens is associated with a low risk for breast and prostate cancer, menopausal symptoms, fibroids, and other hormone-related diseases. For a complete list of the phytoestrogen content of different foods, please see my website, www.patrickholford.com.

Phytosterols: The term phytosterols covers plant sterols and plant stanols. These are naturally occurring substances present in the diet, principally in vegetable oils, and are effective in lowering plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. They do this by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine. In order to achieve a cholesterol-lowering benefit, approximately 1 gram a day of plant sterols or plant stanols needs to be consumed. In comparison, the normal dietary intake is between 200 and 400 mg a day. The best food sources are seeds, beans, and lentils, plus seed oils. Some margarine is now being enriched with phytosterols.

Pipeline: This is found in black pepper and actually helps you absorb more nutrients from your food. So effective is pipeline at improving the uptake of nutrients that you might literally double the nutrients you take in from food simply by going heavy on the pepper. Piperine is particularly high in black pepper, not white, and it’s not present in the other so-called peppers, such as chiles, paprika, and cayenne; these are all fruits from the capsicum family with their own interesting properties. Chiles, for example, are one of the richest known sources of vitamin C. Some people are allergic to these capsicum peppers, but allergy to black pepper is rare. (It can, however, make you sneeze.)

Quercetin: Nature usually provides a solution to cope with ailments—and in the case of hay fever it’s strawberries. Why? Because strawberries, as well as other berries, are especially high in a quirky bioflavonoid called quercetin. Quercetin, along with other bioflavonoids in berries, can also improve the health of capillaries and connective tissues. Because of this, the many benefits of quercetin include alleviating bruising, edema, varicose veins, and fragile capillaries.

A major benefit of quercetin is its ability to inhibit the release of histamine. It is said to help mitigate conditions brought on by some types of allergen (for example, eczema, asthma, hay fever) and has been ascribed anti-inflammatory properties, which means that berries could be good for arthritis sufferers as well.

At the prestigious Mayo Clinic, research has been conducted into quercetin to help treat and prevent prostate cancer, the fastest-rising cancer, now affecting one in six men at some point in their life. In the words of the Mayo Clinic researcher Dr. Nianzeng Xing, “Our laboratory results showed quercetin blocks the androgen activity in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells. By blocking the androgen activity,” he continued, “the growth of prostate cancer cells can be prevented or stopped.”

Sulforaphane: This is another of nature’s great healers found in brassicas—broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, turnips, kale, and especially Broccolini. Originally, it was discovered to reduce risk of stomach cancer and stomach ulcers, but now we know this is mainly because sulforaphane is one of nature’s best antibacterial compounds. As many as half of all stomach ulcers are triggered by infection with the Helicobacter pylori bacterium. Sulforaphane kills off this unpleasant bacterium, helping to keep your digestive tract healthy. Sulforaphane also lessens the incidence of breast cancer in animals.

Zeanxanthin: This is an antioxidant that gives corn its yellow color. It is also found in spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and peas.

When you realize just how many active compounds there are in natural foods, the idea of separating and concentrating each nutrient and supplementing it on its own seems ridiculous. That is why the foundation of optimum nutrition is to eat as much whole, unadulterated natural food as possible and then supplement on top. Natural foods also contain enzymes that help you derive the most benefit from these foods.





Enzymes—the keys of life


We are what we eat, runs the familiar saying. Well, not quite—we are what we can digest and absorb. The food we eat cannot nourish us unless it is first prepared for absorption into the body. This is done by enzymes, chemical compounds that digest and break down large food particles into smaller units. Protein is broken down into amino acids; complex carbohydrate into simple sugars; and fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Every day ten quarts of digestive juices, mainly produced by the pancreas, liver, stomach, and intestinal wall, pour into the digestive tract.

For the body to make these enzymes it needs nutrients. If you become nutrient deficient, enzyme deficiency soon follows (which means your body will be less able to make use of the nutrients it does take in, which makes you become even more enzyme deficient—and so the cycle continues). For example, zinc is needed to make both stomach acid and protein-splitting enzymes called proteases. A zinc-deficient person soon stops breaking down protein efficiently. This makes large food molecules end up where they should not, in the small intestine. If the intestinal wall is not 100 percent intact—a common defect in zinc deficiency—these undigested food particles can get inside the body, where they are seen as invaders and attacked. This is the basis of most food allergies.

Once a food becomes the subject of an allergy, every time it is eaten the reaction in the gut leads to inflammation. This reaction disturbs the normal balance of beneficial bacteria and other microorganisms in the gut. Food allergy triggered by digestive enzyme deficiency is always a possible cause if you are suffering from indigestion, bloating, flatulence, digestive pain, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or candidiasis.

The main families of digestive enzymes are amylases, which digest carbohydrate; proteases, which digest protein; and lipases, which digest fat. As an aid to digestion, many nutritional supplements contain these enzymes. Freeze-dried plant enzymes are often used for this purpose. The most common of them are bromelain from pineapples and papain from papaya, which is chemically similar to pepsin, a powerful protein-digesting enzyme capable of digesting between thirty-five and one hundred times its own weight in protein.





Enzymes from raw food


A good way of boosting your enzyme potential is to eat foods raw, because in this state they contain significant amounts of enzymes. The cooking process tends to destroy enzymes. Professor Artturi Virtanen, Helsinki biochemist and Nobel Prize winner, showed that enzymes are released in the mouth when raw vegetables are chewed; they come into contact with the food and start the act of digestion. These food enzymes are not denatured by stomach acid, as some researchers have suggested, but remain active throughout the digestive tract.

Extensive tests by Kaspar Tropp in Würzburg, Germany, have shown that the human body has a way of protecting enzymes that pass through the gut so more than half reach the colon intact. There they alter the intestinal flora by binding free oxygen, reducing the potential for fermentation and putrefaction in the intestines, a factor linked to cancer of the colon. In so doing, they also help create conditions in which lactic acid-forming beneficial bacteria can grow.

Some foods unfortunately contain enzyme blockers. For example, lentils, beans, and chickpeas contain trypsin inhibitors, preventing protein from being completely digested. However, this antienzyme factor is destroyed either by sprouting these legumes or by cooking them. So bean sprouts or cooked beans are okay. The same is true for grains rich in phytates, which can bind to beneficial minerals.

The two main digestive enzymes, amylase and protease, are found in many foods. For centuries humans have put these food enzymes to work by predigesting foods before eating them. Fermented and aged foods are examples of this. However, raw foods also contain these enzymes, which become active when we chew them. These foods need to be chewed properly, which helps liberate and activate the enzymes they contain. Some foods, like apples, grapes, and mangoes, also contain the antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and catalase, which help disarm free radicals. The chart below shows those foods that have so far been found to contain significant levels of health-promoting enzymes; many foods have still not been investigated.

ENZYMES NATURALLY PRESENT IN RAW FOODS





Probiotics—the inside story


Inside our bodies are twenty times as many bacteria as living cells, and the role they play in keeping you healthy is no less important. Having the right bacteria is vital for healthy digestion, keeping your immune system strong and consequently for fighting infections.

However, not all bacteria are good for you. There are harmful or pathogenic bacteria that can either cause infection directly or produce toxic substances that contribute to inflammation or cancer, particularly of the digestive tract. The good guys, principally two families of bacteria called lactobacillus and bifodobacteria, to a large extent keep the bad guys under control.

What you eat and supplement makes a big difference to the balance of bacteria inside you and consequently your health. The ingesting of beneficial bacteria, known as probiotics, has a number of proven benefits.

THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF PROBIOTICS

Improving your digestion

Producing vitamins

Lowering cholesterol levels

Regulating hormones

Boosting your immunity

Increasing resistance to infections

Relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

Relieving symptoms of thrush

Reducing risk for certain cancers



The value of probiotics was first brought to light in 1907 by Metchnikoff, a Nobel laureate working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who was impressed by the robust health and longevity of Bulgarian peasants who were in the habit of drinking fermented milk. In the 1930s, Dr. Minoru in Japan isolated a strain of lactobacillus bacteria now used in the yogurt drink Yakult, and by the 1990s an estimated twenty million people in Asia were consuming probiotics. In the U.S., about 5 million people consume probiotic supplements or food. Interestingly, the addition of probiotics into animal feed has increased fivefold in the last ten years because this has proven to increase the animals’ growth and reduce signs of stress. This potential benefit has yet to be studied in humans.





When you need probiotics


There is a good case for recommending probiotics, either in fermented foods or as supplements, every single day to promote health and prevent disease. It certainly worked for the Bulgarians. The case is even stronger for the elderly since the amount of colonic bacteria decreases with age. The same is probably true for those under continuous stress. In animal studies, probiotics have been shown to help reduce the symptoms of stress when animals are transported—so if you’re a stressed-out commuter they may help you too! Probiotics may help:

Infections, especially sore throats, candida, or bladder infections

Food poisoning, traveler’s diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome

Inflammatory bowel problems such as Crohn’s disease or colitis

Cancer, especially of the stomach or bowel

Constipation or any digestive disturbance, including indigestion

After a course of antibiotics

After surgery

At times of prolonged stress





Choosing the best probiotic foods and supplements


Many cultures have observed the health-promoting effects of fermented foods and include them as a regular part of their diet. These foods include:

Yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir (from dairy products)

Sauerkraut, pickles (from vegetables)

Miso, tofu, natto, tempeh, tamari, shoyu, soy yogurt (from soybeans)

Wine (from grapes)

Sourdough bread (from wheat or rye)



However, most of these foods don’t contain strains of lactobacillus or bifidobacteria that can colonize in the digestive tract. Yogurt and other fermented dairy products often contain Lactobacillus thermophilus or L. bulgaricus. These bacteria will hang around for a week or so doing good work. They, like the other beneficial bacteria, can make vitamins as well as turn lactose, the main sugar in milk, into lactic acid. This makes the digestive tract slightly more acidic, which inhibits disease-causing microbes. Including these foods in your diet is a good way to promote healthy intestinal flora, although it is not as powerful as supplementing the strains of bacteria that can easily colonize the digestive tract. These resident strains are shown below. The most effective probiotic supplements provide these strains, often in combination.

RESIDENT AND TRANSIENT BACTERIA STRAINS IN ADULTS





“Good” and “bad” bacteria. Not all the “good” bacteria shown on the right take up residence in you. The nonresidents do good work on their way through, but the best bacteria are Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria (think of A and B). Some bacteria, such as E. coli, are often present in the gut in tiny amounts. If they proliferate, they become bad news. Other bacteria, such as salmonella, shouldn’t be there at all and cause diseases such as food poisoning.

Another way to boost the healthy bacteria inside you is to eat foods that feed them. The best food for your health-promoting bacteria are something called fructo-oligosaccharides, or FOS for short, sometimes known as a prebiotic. Bananas are especially rich in these, as are other fruit, barley, garlic, Jerusalem artichokes, onions, soybeans, and wheat. One study found that eating banana powder thickened the stomach lining, as opposed to aspirin, which thins the stomach lining.74

The best probiotic supplements also contain FOS for the bacteria to feed off, promoting their rapid multiplication. FOS can also be supplemented alone and have been shown to help promote more of the good guys and less of the bad guys, as well as relieve constipation.75

Overall, eating a plant-based diet, high in fruit and vegetables, which are naturally high in fiber and FOS, is much more likely to encourage healthy bacteria than a diet that does not include many of these ingredients. On the other hand, a diet high in meat is—apart from being the primary source of gastrointestinal infections—more likely to introduce toxic breakdown products as well as slow down gastrointestinal transit time.





Are your probiotics getting through?


Even if you supplement the right probiotics, in food, powders, or capsules, the next question is to what extent they make it through your stomach to the small and large intestines. The vast majority of gut bacteria reside in the colon—about 100 trillion in one individual, to be precise, which is more than the total number of people on this planet. Stomach acid kills off a lot of bacteria, but certainly not all. There are four ways you can help more get through:

Supplement at least 100 million viable organisms.

Supplement with FOS.

Supplement away from food.

Use enteric-coated supplements.

Use spore-form lactobacillus supplements.



Supplementing enough bacteria is the starting point. You probably need 100 million to a billion viable bacteria to start with. Supplements are made by culturing bacteria, then freeze-drying them. If this is done properly, probiotic supplements are stable for many months, if not years, and do not need to be kept in the refrigerator. When you swallow them and they come into contact with moisture, they come back to life.

A supplement containing FOS will promote rapid multiplication, so you may not need so many as is suggested above. The same is true for microencapsulated or enterically coated supplements, which should be taken with food; otherwise, take supplements away from meals to minimize their destruction from gastric acid in the stomach (stomach acid will normally destroy a percentage of the bacteria you ingest—good and bad). Lactobacilli and Bacillus coagulans (formerly known as Lactobacillus sporogenes) are particularly resistant to stomach acid and are therefore a good choice as a supplement. Bacillus coagulans is especially effective at producing lactic acid, which is the primary way in which probiotics fight infection. Although not resident, Bacillus coagulans hangs around for a week or so doing good work.

If you are taking probiotics therapeutically (for example, to reinoculate the digestive tract after antibiotics or as part of an anti-infection strategy, for instance, to kill off candidiasis), you may need three times the amount needed for general health promotion. Higher levels of probiotics and prebiotics such as FOS do sometimes result in increased flatulence, at least in the short term. This is not necessarily a bad sign—as less desirable organisms die off, symptoms sometimes get worse before they get better.





Living food in action


Every time you eat a combination of fresh, living foods, such as fruit and vegetables, you are giving yourself a cocktail of essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, enzymes, probiotics, and phytochemicals that work together synergistically to promote your health. The idea of separating out each ingredient and then treating it like a drug to cure a specific illness is not just impractical but nonsensical. The moral of this story is to eat foods that you can pick out of the ground or pluck from a tree.

Good habits to develop to ensure that living foods, and the nutrients they contain, form a regular part of your diet

Eat at least three pieces of fresh fruit a day.

Have a salad as a major part of one meal each day.

Eat frequently the many foods rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, watercress, peas, carrots, and berries.

Eat a multicolored variety of foods, as each natural color contains different health-promoting phytochemicals.

Eat whole foods, rather than refined or processed foods full of artificial chemicals.

Eat as much raw food as possible. Steam food where you can, and fry as little as possible.

Wherever possible, buy organic food. If this is not possible, peel or throw away outer leaves and wash to reduce pesticide residues.

Buy fresh foods when you need them, rather than buying ahead and storing them. The longer you keep them, the more their nutrients are destroyed.

Eat fermented foods such as yogurt, cottage cheese, miso, shoyu, sauerkraut, and sourdough bread, especially those cultured with lactobacillus or bifodobacteria.

Take a probiotic supplement containing beneficial strains of bacteria as well as FOS.

Supplement your diet with a synergistic collection of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other phytochemicals (see part 6).
