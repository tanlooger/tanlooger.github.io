title: 12. The Vitamin Scandal
---




Every survey of eating habits conducted in the U.S. since the 1980s shows that even those who said they ate a balanced diet failed to eat anything like the U.S., EU, or World Health Organization recommended daily allowances (RDAs). But these RDAs of nutrients are set by governments to prevent deficiency diseases like scurvy; they are certainly not designed to ensure optimal health, and there is a big difference between a lack of illness and the presence of wellness. For example, the average person gets 3.5 colds a year. In a study of 1,038 doctors and their wives, those who took 410 mg of vitamin C a day had the least signs of illness and lowest incidence of colds. This intake is roughly seven times the RDA for vitamin C.

RDAs are set by panels of scientists in different countries, based on what is known to prevent classic nutrient-deficiency diseases. The trouble is that the scientists cannot agree. From country to country there is often a tenfold variation in recommended levels of nutrients. Dr. Stephen Davies, a medical researcher, tested blood levels of B vitamins in thousands of people and found more than seven in every ten to be deficient.17 The RDAs do not take into account an individual’s circumstances, nor do they consider the question of what is optimal. For example, if you smoke; drink alcohol; live in a polluted city; are premenstrual, menopausal, or on the Pill; exercise a lot; or are fighting an infection or stressed out, your nutrient needs can easily double.

What is more, it is very difficult to eat a diet that meets the RDA levels. What most people conceive of as a well-balanced diet fails to meet RDA requirements. The Bateman Report, published in 1985,18 found that more than 85 percent of people who generally thought they ate a well-balanced diet failed to meet the recommendations. At the other end of the scale, 25 percent of women on income support take in smaller quantities of eight nutrients than the level known to result in serious deficiency diseases (Food Commission, 1992). In truth, fewer than one in ten people eat a diet that meets even UK RDA requirements.

While you might think that our diets are getting better, comparison with a similar survey in 1986–87 shows that our intakes of vitamins A and B12, iron, magnesium, and zinc have all fallen. These vitamins and minerals are vital for health and the evidence is that we need more, not less, for optimal health. B12, for example, is often low in older people and helps lower homocysteine thereby reducing risk for heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Yet if you give older people with raised homocysteine levels 10 mcg of B12, which is about twice the RDA, it neither corrects their deficiency nor lowers homocysteine. Only levels of 50 mcg (that’s over eight times the RDA) bring them back to optimal health.19





Empty calories


As much as two-thirds of the average calorie intake is from fat, sugar, and refined flours. The calories in these foods are called “empty” because they provide no nutrients and are often hidden in processed foods and snacks that usually weigh little but satisfy our appetite instantly. For instance, two cookies provide more calories than 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of carrots and are considerably easier to eat—but they provide no vitamins or minerals. If a quarter of your diet by weight, and two-thirds by calories, consists of such dismembered foods, there is little room left to accommodate the necessary levels of the essential nutrients. Wheat, for example, has twenty-five nutrients removed in the refining process that turns it into white flour, yet only four (iron, B1, B2, and B3) are replaced. On average, 87 percent of the essential minerals zinc, chromium, and manganese are lost. Have we been shortchanged?

This raises three questions. What is “need”? Are the RDA levels enough? How can we achieve the necessary intake?





Why feeling just “all right” is not all right


To date the evidence is that most people are being shortchanged on health, owing to inadequate intakes of vitamins and minerals. Since the 1980s, proper scientific studies using multinutrient supplements have shown that they boost immunity, increase IQ, reduce birth defects, improve childhood development, reduce colds, stop PMS, improve bone density, balance moods, reduce aggression, increase energy, reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, and basically promote a long and healthy life. Most people are putting up with “feeling all right”—accepting the odd cold, headache, mouth ulcer, muscle cramp or bout of PMS, mood fluctuations, poor concentration, and lack of energy. Back in 1982 at the Institute for Optimum Nutrition we put seventy-six volunteers on a six-month supplement program.20 At the end of this time, 79 percent reported a definite improvement in energy, 60 percent spoke of better memory and mental alertness, 66 percent felt more emotionally balanced, 57 percent had fewer colds and infections, and 55 percent had better skin.





What is optimum?


The RDAs are not enough for optimum health. Thanks to Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin and colleagues from the University of Alabama, we are getting closer to defining optimum nutrition.21 Over a fifteen-year period they studied 13,500 people living in six regions of the United States. Each participant completed in-depth health questionnaires and was given physical, dental, eye, and other examinations, as well as numerous blood tests, cardiac function tests, and a detailed dietary analysis. The object was to find which nutrient-intake levels were associated with the highest health ratings.

The results consistently revealed that the healthiest individuals, meaning those with the fewest clinical signs and symptoms, were taking supplements and eating diets rich in nutrients relative to calories. The researchers found that the intake of nutrients associated with optimal health was often ten or more times higher than the RDA levels. At the Institute for Optimum Nutrition we’ve continued this research and have identified the levels of intakes of nutrients that are optimum by looking at studies that prove better health with additional intakes of nutrients above the so-called “well-balanced diet.”

For example, ninety-six healthy elderly people were given a high-strength multivitamin and mineral supplement or placebo. Those on the supplement had fewer infections and their blood tests revealed a stronger immune system; in fact, they were healthier overall. Of twenty-two thousand pregnant women, some on supplements, some not, the group taking supplements gave birth to 75 percent fewer babies with birth defects.22 In another study, ninety schoolchildren were given a high-strength multivitamin and mineral supplement, placebo, or nothing. Seven months later the IQ scores of those on supplements were 10 percent higher than those of the other two groups.

A similar study was carried out on a group of ninety-six people over the age of sixty-five. They too had dramatic improvements in mental performance and memory.23 The same research group gave multivitamins to elderly people and found it halved their risk of infection.24 A professor of medicine examined all studies looking at vitamin C versus the common cold, selecting only those where 1,000 mg or more was given and involving a placebo group (known as double-blind testing).25 Of these tests, thirty-seven out of thirty-eight concluded that supplementing 1,000 mg, twenty times the RDA, had a protective effect. Professor Morris Brown at Cambridge University gave two thousand patients with heart disease vitamin E or a placebo. Those taking vitamin E had 75 percent fewer heart attacks.26

These are just some of the hundreds of scientific studies published in respected medical journals proving that an intake of vitamins above RDA levels enhances resistance to infection, improves intellectual performance, and reduces the risk of birth defects, cancer, and heart disease. By reviewing all this research, we have established our suggested optimal intakes of nutrients. At ION we call these levels the optimum daily allowances, or ODAs for short, shown on the next page. Also shown is what you can reasonably be expected to achieve from your diet. The shortfall between this and our ODAs is well worth supplementing.

Despite this, some “flat-earthers” continue to say that supplements are a waste of money. To quote one antisupplement survey of people who took supplements, published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, “It is ironic that adults who were not overweight and whose health was good used supplements more frequently than did less healthy individuals.” What a strange coincidence! I think of supplements like clothes—they are not strictly natural, although they are made from natural ingredients. They don’t have any downsides if used properly and, as every year passes, have more and more proven benefits. I think soon everyone will be taking them in addition to, I hope, eating a healthy diet.





Vitamin A


This vitamin is essential for reproduction and for the maintenance of epithelial tissue found in skin, outside and in, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and so on. Beta-carotene is the most active precursor of vitamin A, and in high doses, unlike vitamin A itself, is not toxic. Vitamin A is important in cancer prevention and treatment of precancerous conditions. It is also essential for vision. Many autistic children have problems with visual perception and don’t look straight at you. This is because there are more receptors for black and white vision—called rods—in the periphery of the eye. Give these kids natural vitamin A from fish oil and they look straight at you. In regard to cancer, people with low beta-carotene intake have a 30 to 220 percent higher risk of developing lung cancer, for example. The optimal intake of vitamin A is likely to be at least double the RDA. Even higher levels of beta-carotene may confer extra benefits.



RDAs versus ODAs and dietary intakes. This chart shows the differences between the RDA, (now shown as Dietary Value [DV] on labels) our average intake, and our ideal intake. The gray amounts are the levels we could reach if we ate a good variety of fruit and vegetables daily—that is, a good diet.

Using vitamin C as an example, the RDA is 60 mg. The average intake is 100 mg. If you eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, you could achieve 200 mg. The optimal intake is somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 mg. The ODA is set at the midpoint of 2,000 mg. The shortfall between a good diet (200 mg) and the ODA (2,000 mg) is 1,800 mg. This is the kind of level worth supplementing.





Vitamin B complex


This group of vitamins includes eight essential nutrients. These five are most commonly deficient.

B1 (thiamine) is unlikely to be needed at levels more than eleven times the RDA unless you are consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates. A study of 1,009 dentists and their wives found the healthiest to consume on average 9 mg of thiamine a day.

vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is needed in greater quantities by those who exercise frequently. To date there is insufficient evidence to recommend more than double the RDA.

vitamin B3 (niacin) is famous for its ability to help remove unwanted cholesterol but notorious for its vasodilatory or blushing effect in high doses. According to one study, the healthiest people consume 115 mg a day, which is about six times the RDA.

vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is another B vitamin that appears to have considerable benefit at levels ten times higher than the RDA. It is essential for all protein utilization and has been helpful in a variety of conditions from PMS to carpal tunnel syndrome (a strain condition affecting nerves in the wrist) and cardiovascular disease.

Folic acid is now recognized as essential for the prevention of neural tube defects in pregnancy, and the U.S. Public Health Service recommends pregnant women take a daily 400 mcg supplement. Optimal levels, especially in the elderly, may be much higher. There is one caution, however: folic acid supplementation can mask B12-deficiency anemia, so it is best to supplement extra folic acid with vitamin B12.





Vitamin C


This one is necessary for a strong immune system, for collagen and bone formation, for energy production, and as an antioxidant. In a study of 1,038 doctors and their wives, those with a daily intake of 410 mg of vitamin C had the fewest signs of illness or degenerative disease.27 This intake, roughly ten times the RDA, is close to that of our primitive ancestors. A large number of studies have found a reduced risk of cancer in those with a high vitamin C intake. Vitamin C status and bone density decline from the age of thirty-five. Numerous studies have shown vitamin C to be associated with improved bone density as well as keeping the absorption of iron, giving us good reason to increase our intake as we get older.

The protective role of vitamin C against various cancers, cardiovascular disease, and the common cold becomes significant only when the intake is above 400 to 1,000 mg a day. In a large survey in the United States, analyzed by Dr. Paul Enstrom and Dr. Linus Pauling, significant reductions in overall mortality and mortality from cancer and cardiovascular disease were reported in those who took vitamin E and C supplements. Since 1,000 mg of vitamin C is equivalent to twenty-two oranges, supplementation is essential. The RDA for vitamin C is only 60 mg—the equivalent of an orange a day.





Vitamin E


One of the most essential antioxidants, vitamin E helps the body use oxygen properly. A number of studies have found low vitamin E status to be associated with high cancer incidence. Supplementation of this vitamin has been shown to boost immunity and reduce infections in the elderly as well as halve the risk of cataracts. The optimal intake of vitamin E is fifteen times the RDA.





Vitamins D and K


These are not commonly deficient. Vitamin K is made by bacteria in the gut, while vitamin D can be made in the skin on exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D is also found in milk, meat, and eggs. Deficiency is likely only in dark-skinned vegans who have little exposure to the sun.





The decline of fruit and vegetables


The sad truth is that food today is not what it used to be. Fruit and vegetables are only as good as the soil in which they are grown. Minerals pass from the soil to the plant and in turn help the plant grow and produce vitamins. The trouble is that modern farming, which relies heavily on artificial fertilizers and pesticides, robs the soil of nutrients and does not replace them. Phosphates found in fertilizers and pesticides bind to the minerals in the soil, making them less available to the plant. Through overfarming, the soil becomes nutrient-deficient anyway. However, adding fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium) enables plants to go on growing, but without the full complement of minerals. So the plant does not make its full complement of vitamins and we too end up deficient.

For these reasons, plus the length of time we store foods, there is a staggering range of nutrient content in fruit and vegetables. An orange may provide from 180 mg of vitamin C to none at all, the average being around 60 mg. Yes, some supermarket oranges contain no vitamin C! A hundred grams of wheat germ (about three cups) provides from 3.2 to 21 IU of vitamin E. A large (3.5 oz. or 100 g) carrot can provide from 70 to 18,500 IU of vitamin A. While it’s great to eat lots of fruit and vegetables, the quality is just as important as the quantity. For this reason, it is best to buy local produce in season and consume it quickly. The worst thing you can do is buy fruit shipped in from the other side of the world and leave it hanging around for two weeks before you eat it. Organic food also tends to have much higher levels of both vitamins and minerals and other antioxidants.





VARIATIONS IN NUTRIENT CONTENT IN COMMON FOODS

Nutrient

Variation (per 3.5 oz. of food)



Vitamin A in carrots

70 to 18,500 IU



vitamin B5 in whole wheat flour

0.3 to 3.3 mg



Vitamin C in oranges

0 to 116 mg



Vitamin E in wheat germ

3.2 to 21 IU



Iron in spinach

0.1 to 158 mg



Manganese in lettuce

0.1 to 16.9 mg





Good food goes off


Food manufacturing, even more than farming practices, is the greatest cause of vitamin loss. Foods are refined so they last longer. Flour, rice, and sugar lose more than 77 percent of their zinc, chromium, and manganese in the refining process. Other essential nutrients, such as essential fats, will not be present in processed foods because these and other nutrients (except antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E, which preserve foods) can decrease shelf life. There is an old saying among nutritionists that “good food goes off”—the trick is to eat it first.





What about cooking?


More than half the nutrients in the food you eat are destroyed before they reach your plate, depending on the food you choose, how you store it, and how you cook it. Every process that food goes through, whether boiling, baking, frying, or freezing, takes its toll. Think about the life of a scarlet runner bean. It is picked, stored, cooked, frozen, stored in the supermarket until you buy it, partially defrosted on the way home, refrozen, boiled, and eaten. Just how much goodness is left?

The three main enemies of vitamins and minerals are heating, water, and oxidation. Vitamin C is very prone to oxidation, sacrificing itself to harmful oxides that make food go rancid. While it might protect your food, it will not protect you if there is none left by the time you eat it. The longer your food has been stored, and the more surface area is exposed to air and light, the less vitamin C there is likely to be. Orange juice, which is packed using a special process to minimize oxide exposure on packing, suffers a 33 percent loss of vitamin C in twenty-two weeks, which is a conceivable time lag between orange grove and breakfast glass. Once you open the carton, oxidation occurs rapidly, especially if you fail to put it back in the refrigerator, which also protects it from light. Analyses of rosehip tea bags have shown negligible traces of vitamin C or none at all, even before they are immersed in boiling water that is likely to kill off any remaining traces.

Nor is vitamin C the only vitamin susceptible to oxidation: the antioxidant vitamins A and E are also prone to damage. Being fat soluble, they tend to be protected by being in fattier foods. Beta-carotene, the vegetable form of vitamin A, is water soluble and highly prone to oxidation. While storing foods in cool, dark places tends to help, oxidation still occurs even in the refrigerator. Spinach stored in an open container will lose 10 percent of its vitamin C content every day.

On the whole, frozen foods keep their nutrient content much better. Chilled foods, kept for two weeks in the supermarket and one week in your refrigerator, will have lost their vitamin vitality, while there is little difference in nutrient loss between frozen peas and fresh peas, once boiled.

Any form of heating destroys nutrients. The degree of destruction depends on the cooking time and on whether the container disperses the heat evenly, but most of all on the temperature. On average, 20 to 70 percent of the nutrient content of leafy vegetables is lost in cooking.

Deep-frying produces temperatures in excess of 392°F, which oxidize fat and turn essential fatty acids into trans fats that are no good for anything. Animals fed such oils develop atherosclerosis. Refined oils, left for weeks on supermarket shelves exposed to light, are already damaged. These oils should not be used for frying as they increase the destruction of antioxidant nutrients like vitamins A, C, and E both in the food and later in the body See this page, this page, this page for the best way to fry food if you still want to use this cooking method.

Minerals and water-soluble vitamins leach into cooking water. The more water you use and the longer the cooking time, the more this is likely to occur. If the temperature is above 122°F, cell structures begin to break down, which enables nutrients within them to be leached out. High temperatures can also destroy some of the vitamins, though not the minerals. If you boil or steam food for a short while, the temperature at the core of the food will be much lower than at the outside. Foods can therefore be protected by being cooked whole or in large pieces. The loss of nutrients in boiled food tends to be around 20 to 50 percent. It is a good idea to use the mineral-rich water as stock for soups or sauces.

Microwaving water-based foods such as vegetables generates heat by vibrating the water particles in the food and vitamin and mineral losses are minimal. However, as far as essential fats are concerned, the heat generated by microwaving rapidly destroys them, so never microwave a dish with oils, nuts, or seeds in it. And if you do microwave your food, stand well back. You need to be about ten feet away to no longer be exposed to its electromagnetic radiation.

Some guidelines for getting the most vitamins out of your food

Eat foods as fresh and unprocessed as possible.

Keep fresh food cool and in the dark in the refrigerator in sealed containers.

Eat more raw food. Be adventurous: try raw beet and carrot tops in salad.

Prepare foods cold where possible (for example, carrot soup, see this page) and heat to serve.

Cook foods as whole as possible, slicing or blending before serving.

Steam or boil foods with as little water as possible, and keep the water for stock.

Fry as little food as possible and do not overcook, burn, or brown it.

Supplement your diet to ensure optimum levels of vitamins.
