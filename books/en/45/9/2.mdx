title: Which fats and oils?
---




Foods vary in the quality and quantity of fat they contain. The perfect diet provides no more than 20 per cent of its calories from fat. However, more important is the kind of fat. Polyunsaturated fats, or rather oils since they are always liquid, are essential, while monounsaturated and saturated fats are not. So, in an ideal food more of the fat is polyunsaturated. The table on the next page shows which fat-containing foods to avoid and which to increase. Those in bold type are best avoided, or limited, because they contain few essential fats, are high in saturated fat, and have an overall high fat percentage.

There are different families of unsaturated fats. The omega-6 and omega-3 families are essential. Ideally, your diet should provide roughly equal amounts of these. The omega-9 family derive from the monounsaturated fat oleic acid, of which olive oil is a good source. These are not essential, but not harmful, except in excess. The table below shows which cold-pressed oils contain which unsaturated fats.
