title: Which foods are rich in phytoestrogens?
---




Phytoestrogens are plant-based estrogen-like chemicals that appear to protect against hormone-related cancers. There are many types of phytoestrogen—more than eight hundred in total. One of the most potent forms that is used in a lot of the cancer research is called isoflavones—in particular compounds called genistein and daidzein—and these are found in highest concentrations in soybean products. Others called ligands are abundant in flaxseeds, black and green tea, coffee, fruit and vegetables, split peas, lentils, and beans. And another common category called coumestans is found in alfalfa, beans, split peas, and lentils.

Cultures whose diets include such foods have much lower risk for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and menopausal symptoms. I recommend you aim for around 15 mg (15,000 mcg) a day, which is equivalent to an Asian diet, ideally eating a phytoestrogen-rich food source twice a day, as they are only in circulation for about six hours. This is easily achieved by a small portion of tofu (a 3.5 oz. serving provides 78 mg), half a cup of soy milk or soy yogurt (11 mg), or a portion of chickpeas, perhaps as hummus (2 mg). Eating rye bread, bean sprouts, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds helps.

The table below is adapted from the Phytoestrogen Database 2004, compiled by Dr. Margaret Ritchie, Bute Medical School at the University of St. Andrews (Scotland) and reproduced with her kind permission. It provides a measure of the isoflavone phytoestrogen level in common foods per 100 g, which is roughly per serving.
