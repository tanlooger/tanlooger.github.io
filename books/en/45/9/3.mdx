title: Which carbohydrates?
---




Carbohydrates should make up the major part of your diet, accounting for two-thirds of the calories you consume. Since there are more calories per gram of both protein and fat, this means that, by weight, carbohydrates should make up more than two-thirds of your diet.

The type of carbohydrate is as important as the amount. Some carbohydrates, such as sugar, are “fast releasing,” which means they raise your blood sugar level quickly. Others, such as oats, are “slow releasing.” The most accurate way to gauge whether or not you should eat a food is by checking the glycemic load (GL) of a food, which is a calculation based on both the quantity of carbohydrate in a food and the quality of that carbohydrate.

A GL of 10 or less is good, shown in bold

A GL of 11–14 is okay, shown in normal text

A GL of 15 or more is bad, shown in italics

However, even this is only a guide, because the amount you eat of a food will obviously alter its effect on your blood sugar, and hence your weight. So, while I generally say liberally eat the foods in bold text with a low GL, limit the foods in normal text, and avoid the foods in italics, what is most important is to limit the total GL of your diet. Eat no more than 50 GL points a day, or 15 with each meal.

If you want to lose weight, eat no more than 40 GL points a day. This means roughly 10 for breakfast, 10 for lunch, 10 for dinner, and 5 in each of two snacks, midmorning and midafternoon. If you choose the good, low-GL foods, you’ll be able to eat more food. If you choose the bad, high-GL foods, you’ll have to eat much less.

In the chart below, mainly select from the bold foods, then use the right-hand column to work out how much to eat for 10 GL points. Foods containing no carbohydrate, composed entirely of protein or fat (meat, fish, eggs, cheese, mayonnaise) have, in effect, a GL of 0, and are not included in this chart.
