title: Balancing acid and alkaline foods
---




When foods are metabolized by the body, a residue is left that can alter the body’s acidity and alkalinity Depending on the chemical composition of the “ash,” the food is called “acid forming” or “alkaline forming.” This is not to be confused with the immediate acidity of a food. Oranges, for example, are acid due to their citric acid content. However, citric acid is completely metabolized and the net effect of eating an orange is to alkalize the body, hence it is classified as alkaline forming. Roughly 80 percent of our diet should come from alkaline-forming foods and 20 per cent from acid-forming foods. The table below shows which foods are which.
