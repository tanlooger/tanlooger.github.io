title: Glycemic load (GL) of common drinks
---






The GI and GL values of foods listed here are derived from research published by K, Foster-Powell, S. H. Holt, and J. C. Brand-Miller. 2002. International table of glycemic index and glycemic load values. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 76 (1): 5–56.

Foods marked “E” are estimated values, while other foods have measured values. As the GLs of more foods are calculated, this table is updated on www.theholforddiet.com.





NOTES


Serving size notes:

All pasta serving sizes are for cooked food. For the equivalent of dry weight, halve the score. So, if you’re cooking spaghetti and the serving size is 120 g (4 oz.), that means you put 60 g (2 oz.) in the pot. Portion guide at a glance:

All servings provide 7 GLs.
