title: How much fiber?
---




Foods vary in both the amount of fiber they contain and its quality. One measure of quality is the amount of water that the fiber absorbs, which indicates to what extent it can make fecal matter lighter, bulkier, and easier to move through the digestive tract. The ideal intake of fiber is not less than 35 grams a day. The following table shows you how much of given foods provides 10 grams of fiber (or the equivalent effect of 10 grams of grain fiber if the type of fiber is substantially more absorbent and therefore the amount you need in comparison is less). All measures are based on raw or dry foods. Please note that cooking decreases the fiber content of foods. So four servings of any of these foods will provide an ideal intake of fiber. All foods are raw, unless otherwise stated.
