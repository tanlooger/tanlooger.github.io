title: Which protein foods?
---




The protein in foods varies in both its quantity and quality. The table below-shows you how much protein is in the listed foods (percentage of calories as protein), how much of the food you would need to eat to obtain 20 grams of protein, and how “usable” the protein is, which is a measure of its quality in isolation. Less “usable” protein sources may become highly usable when combined with other foods (see this page). Most people need no more than 35 grams a day, so two of any of the servings below would suffice. If the quality of the protein is high, one and a half servings may be enough. Pregnant women, people recovering from surgery, athletes, and anyone who does heavy manual work may need three servings a day.
