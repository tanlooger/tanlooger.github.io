title: 39. Birthrights and Wrongs

We are all older than we like to think. From a health perspective, the nine months spent in the womb and the months before conception are the most critical periods of our lives. Scientists are increasingly discovering that a mother’s health and nutrition during preconception and pregnancy have a profound effect on the health of the infant, and that patterns of disease in adulthood can be traced to infant nutrition. Optimum nutrition increases fertility, the health of a pregnancy, and the chances of having a healthy baby with strong resilience to disease.





Maximizing fertility


One in every four couples suffers from some degree of infertility. For some, this means having fewer children than they want; for many, it means no children at all. And even for couples who are fertile, getting pregnant is not the easy matter that it is commonly thought to be. The average length of time taken to get pregnant is six months, although eighteen months is not uncommon. But unless fertility tests show otherwise, failure to conceive within eighteen months does not necessarily mean that you are completely infertile.

While it’s well known that a woman’s fertility decreases with age, did you know that a man’s does too? A couple’s chances of conceiving within six months of trying decrease by 2 percent for every year the man is over twenty-four, regardless of how young his partner is. And if she’s in her thirties, then she’ll take twice as long to conceive as a woman in her twenties. Yet, despite these statistics, research has shown that if both partners are in good health and receiving optimum levels of all the right nutrients, the effect of their age on their chances of conceiving and having a successful pregnancy can be reduced.

Fertility and the speed of conception depend on many factors, some psychological, some physical, and some nutritional. Conception rate is very high during holiday periods, for example, since stress—a major factor in infertility—is reduced. Knowing how to time intercourse to coincide with ovulation (the release of the female egg to be fertilized by the sperm) greatly increases the chances of conception. Also, your nutrition and especially your vitamin status play a crucial role.





Vitamins for fertility


The male partner is responsible in about a third of infertility cases. (It should be stressed that infertility has nothing to do with sexual virility, which is usually not affected.) The usual test for infertility in a man involves a sperm count—the higher the sperm count, the greater the fertility. One study has shown that extra vitamin C increased sperm count as well as sperm mobility.1 Likewise, vitamin E or essential fat deficiency has been found to induce sterility in both sexes by causing damage to the reproductive tissues. Unfortunately, however, simply taking vitamin E will not reverse the condition if you are sterile.

The high rate of infertility among diabetics may provide us with a clue. Diabetics are frequently low in vitamin A, which is essential for making the male sex hormones. Vitamin A is dependent on the release of zinc from the liver. Of all the nutrients known to affect male fertility, zinc is perhaps the best researched. Signs of zinc deficiency include late sexual maturation, small sex organs, and infertility. With adequate supplements of zinc, these problems can be corrected.

Dr. Carl Pfeiffer, director of the Princeton Biocenter, one of the first research groups to identify the importance of zinc, also found a high degree of impotence and infertility in male patients who suffer from zinc deficiency. “With adequate dosage of vitamin B6 and zinc,” he wrote, “the sexual ability of the male should return in one or two months’ time.” In view of the fact that the average dietary intake of zinc is half the RDA, the effects of zinc on fertility may be quite substantial and widespread. Zinc is found in high concentrations in male sex glands and in the sperm itself, where it is needed to make the outer layer and the tail.





Care prior to conception


The best odds for a healthy offspring are achieved when both partners prepare for pregnancy. It takes three months for sperm to mature, while the egg or ovum takes a month. If, during these preconceptual months, each partner pursues optimum nutrition, minimizes intake of antinutrients, especially alcohol, and stays healthy, the chances of a healthy conception are high, especially if the couple abstains from sex during the nonfertile phases of the month.

One in three conceptions is spontaneously aborted during the first three months of pregnancy. This risk is reduced when both partners are optimally nourished and healthy. A common cause of miscarriage is a lack of progesterone, which is needed to maintain the pregnancy in the early weeks. This can be a result of estrogen dominance (see chapter 25).

Homocysteine is a new health marker that’s been making headlines for its association with more than one hundred different health conditions including infertility and pregnancy complications. One study, which looked at nearly six thousand women, found that those with high homocysteine levels were up to 100 percent more likely to have suffered problems with their pregnancies or had babies with birth defects. It’s now easy to have your homocysteine tested, and if a high level is found, this can be reduced to a healthy level in around three months with the right nutritional supplements. It’s well worth checking your homocysteine level before trying to conceive, and lowering your score, if it’s above six, by supplementing folic acid, B12, B6, and TMG (see chapter 16).

Anyone considering IVF (in vitro fertilization; where a woman’s egg and her partner’s sperm are fertilized outside her body and then implanted in the womb) should cover all these “optimum nutrition” bases first. While IVF has an average success rate of 21.8 percent (and that’s among the “cream of the crop,” who are selected for this expensive treatment), the holistic approach—where both partners are given an optimum nutrition method of treatment and any underlying health problems resolved—has a success rate of more than 78 percent, according to the preconception care organization Foresight, which followed up the pregnancies of 1,076 couples, 779 of which resulted in a live birth.





Vitamins for a healthy pregnancy


Optimum nutrition can greatly improve your chances of having a healthy pregnancy. Even the slightest deficiencies during pregnancy can have serious effects on the health of the offspring, and the idea that birth defects are often caused by nutritional imbalances in the mother is rapidly gaining wider acceptance. So far, slight deficiencies of vitamins B1, B2, and B6, folic acid, zinc, iron, calcium, and magnesium have all been linked to birth abnormalities. So too have excesses of toxic metals, especially lead, cadmium, and copper.

Severe deficiencies of any vitamin will cause birth abnormalities, since a vitamin is by definition necessary for maintaining normal growth. A healthy pregnancy will of course depend on a greater supply than normal of all these nutrients, since accommodating the needs of a growing fetus as well as her own body puts extra demands on the expectant mother.





Spina bifida


As many as 5 percent of births show some developmental defect, many of which affect the central nervous system. Spina bifida, a condition in which the spinal cord does not develop properly, has been strongly linked to a lack of folic acid and probably of other nutrients, too, in the mother’s diet. A survey of twenty-three thousand women found that those who supplemented their diet during the first six weeks of pregnancy had a 75 percent lower incidence of neural tube defects than those who did not.2 The incidence of this condition is far higher when mothers have had a nutritionally poor diet for the first three months of pregnancy. One study found that dietary counseling alone lowered the rate of spina bifida in babies born to mothers at risk, but that the administration of extra folic acid, on its own or in a multivitamin, resulted in a much lower number of babies with neural tube defects. Since the optimum daily allowance for folic acid intake is 800 mcg per day, with a good diet providing 400 mcg per day, a supplement of at least 400 mcg per day is recommended for women intending to become pregnant.





Morning sickness


In the first three months of pregnancy, all the organs of the baby’s body are completely formed, so during this period optimum nutrition is extremely important. Yet at this time many women experience continual sickness and do not feel like eating healthily. Misnamed “morning sickness,” this condition has been accepted as normal during the first three months of pregnancy and is probably due to increases in a hormone called HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). Women with poor diets are particularly at risk.

During pregnancy, the need for vitamins B6 and B12, folic acid, iron, and zinc increases; supplements of these usually stop even the worst cases of pregnancy sickness. Eating small, frequent amounts of fruit or complex carbohydrates like nuts, seeds, or whole grains often helps. However, the best approach is to ensure optimum nutrition well before pregnancy. At the Institute for Optimum Nutrition, we followed up four women on optimum programs before and during pregnancy—the average number of days on which nausea or sickness was reported was two. Yet for some women nausea continues throughout pregnancy!





Preeclamptic toxemia


Another common complication of pregnancy is preeclamptic toxemia, characterized by an increase in blood pressure, edema (swelling), and excessive protein in the urine. Many theories abound as to why this occurs, but once more, optimum nutrition is a vital factor. One of my clients who had preeclamptic toxemia during her first pregnancy improved her diet and added nutritional supplements; her second pregnancy was entirely healthy.





Think zinc


Getting through pregnancy without developing any stretch marks isn’t just down to luck—it’s related to a woman’s nutritional status. So for smooth, elastic skin, boost zinc levels by eating nuts, fish, peas, and egg yolks, supplementing 15 mg a day, and ensuring a good daily source of vitamins C and E.

Food cravings in pregnancy are usually a sign of mineral deficiencies. When a mother-to-be boosts levels of zinc, for example, cravings usually disappear, while replenishing iron can remove cravings for strange, sometimes harmful, substances such as chalk or coal.





Vitamin and mineral supplements


For the mother, optimum nutrition before and during pregnancy ensures a healthier pregnancy with fewer complications, resulting in a healthier and heavier baby. Your daily supplement program should include 400 mcg of folic acid, 20 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 mg of vitamin B6, 15 mg of zinc, 300 mg of calcium, 200 mg of magnesium, and 12 mg of iron. Do not take more than 10,000 IU of vitamin A and have a hair-mineral analysis carried out to check for excesses of copper, lead, or cadmium.





Essential fats


Also crucial during pregnancy are essential fats, especially the omega-3 fat DHA, and choline.

Research shows that getting a good supply of choline during pregnancy helps restructure a baby’s developing brain for improved performance (it also improves memory in adults). To boost levels, eat lots of free-range eggs and sprinkle lecithin granules (available from health food shops) on your cereal every morning. It is also well worth supplementing the essential omega-3 and omega-6 fats GLA, EPA, and DHA as well as eating fish. However, large fish such as swordfish, marlin, and tuna contain higher levels of mercury than salmon and sardines, which have very little by comparison and still provide plenty of omega-3 (see also this page–this page).





Boosters after birth


Optimum nutrition is doubly important after birth, when the mother has to continue nourishing herself and her child. The stress of motherhood and the sleepless nights, coupled with extra nutritional needs, often make the first few months hard work. Breast-feeding (see also below) is not just best for a baby, it’s also beneficial for the mother. It burns up five hundred calories a day (making getting back in shape easier), stimulates the uterus to contract to its prebirth size, reduces the mother’s risk of developing breast cancer in later life, and saves a considerable amount in money in formula and bottles in the first year. Any nutrients you supplement also get delivered straight to your baby, as well as give your energy a boost. So, continue supplementing the recommended levels for pregnancy. Also make sure you have good support and a good supply of easy-to-prepare nutritious foods, especially during the first few weeks.





Postpartum depression


It is not uncommon for mothers to experience depression immediately after the birth. No doubt there is a psychological component to consider: now you have a baby—a big responsibility. However, many researchers believe that postpartum depression is brought on by hormonal and chemical changes that can be stopped with good nutrition.

One possibility is an excess of copper. The levels of copper tend to rise during pregnancy, while zinc levels tend to fall because the baby requires more. In most women, the zinc content in breast milk declines rapidly as the infant uses up the mother’s reserves. With a World Health Organization estimated requirement of 25 mg a day, and an average intake of 7.5 mg a day, yet no medical advice to increase zinc-rich foods or take supplements, zinc deficiency in mothers after giving birth is commonplace. Depression is a classic symptom, which can be corrected by supplementation with zinc and vitamin B6. According to Dr. Carl Pfeiffer, who helped establish the importance of zinc for brain function, “We have never seen postnatal depression or psychosis in any of our patients treated with zinc and B6.”

Another potential cause is lack of omega-3 fats. Eating oily fish, and supplementing fish oils, zinc, and B complex, can ensure that a new mother doesn’t develop postpartum depression.





The importance of breast-feeding


While breast-feeding does not guarantee optimum nutrition for the baby, there is little doubt that breast is best, especially when the mother is optimally nourished. The balance of nutrients in breast milk in an optimally nourished woman is far superior to that in formula milks. One key factor is the high levels of essential fatty acids necessary for intellectual development. In fact, the discovery that breast-fed babies later achieved better intellectual performance than bottle-fed babies led to the realization of the importance of giving infants high levels of essential fatty acids.

One other great disadvantage of bottle-feeding is the milk itself. The consumption of cow’s milk is strongly discouraged in infants before they are at least six months old. This is because their digestive and immune systems are too immature to deal with this complex protein—the result is often allergy. The recent discovery that child-onset diabetes results from the immune system becoming allergic to a protein in cow’s milk and beef, and then cross-reacting with a virtually identical protein in the pancreas, resulting in the destruction of pancreatic tissue, has led many pediatricians not only to caution against giving infants cow’s milk before the age of six months, but also to advise mothers to keep off beef and milk for as long as they are breast-feeding. If this finding proves correct, simply avoiding cow’s milk and beef, for both infants and mothers, could eliminate child-onset diabetes (see chapter 8 for a fuller discussion).





Weaning—when and what?


Once infants can sleep through the night without a feed, or are developing teeth, this is a good sign that it could be time to wean them on to solid foods—usually when they are around six months old. An infant’s chewing on a piece of cucumber or carrot also helps encourage other teeth to come through. Since the longest time between meals should be dinner to breakfast, introducing some solid food for dinner may help the child sleep through the night.

Healthy babies, like healthy adults, need food that is fresh, unprocessed, additive free, sugar free (which includes sucrose, glucose, dextrose, maltose, and fructose), salt-free, and low in fat. In other words, they should be given food that is close to how it is found in nature. The baby will eventually be eating the food that you eat (which is, of course, completely healthy if you are following the recommendations in this book) and so will need to get used to eating this way right from the start. Below are a number of suggestions on how to eat healthily without using lots of packaged baby foods.

To be fair, packaged baby foods are improving all the time; they no longer contain artificial additives, and some are sugar free. However, the idea that a baby needs fiber or should not have sugar on his pureed roast beef dinner has not yet filtered through to all baby food manufacturers. As in the case of adult food, if you are going to use the occasional prepared food, read the label. If it contains cereal, it should be whole wheat and unrefined; it should not contain any of the sugars listed above, modified starch, hydrogenated fat, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, or any ingredient that you do not understand.





Fiber for babies


Some mothers will not give their baby a high-fiber diet as it “goes straight through them.” What they often mean is that they are getting three dirty diapers a day and cannot be bothered to change them that often. Frankly, I would rather change three dirty diapers a day for a year or two than nurse an older person through the horrors of bowel cancer when the “baby” is grown up. As in the case of an adult, a healthy infant bowel should be emptying itself two to three times a day. Much of the food will come out as, for example, recognizable lentils or grape skins, owing to the fact that a baby cannot chew foods properly.





Preventing allergies


If there’s a family history of allergies or related conditions such as eczema or asthma, then it’s possible to reduce the chances of passing these from mother to baby by 50 percent simply by taking a “probiotic” supplement during pregnancy. Biotic means “life,” and a probiotic encourages friendly bacteria to thrive in the digestive tract. Modern living means that many people’s digestive bacteria are compromised by stress, a diet high in refined carbohydrates, antibiotics, and steroid drugs such as birth control pills—and these contribute to digestive problems, allergies, eczema, and asthma.

At the start of weaning, give your baby food that is very easily digested and unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. Cooked, pureed vegetables and fruit are a good start. If a fruit or vegetable can be given raw, leave it like that, for example, bananas, avocados, very ripe pears, or papayas. The later you introduce a food, the less likelihood there is of its producing an allergic reaction. So if you suspect that your child may have an allergic reaction (if there is, for instance, a family history of allergy) or you just want to be absolutely certain that your child does not develop any allergies, introduce potential allergens as late as you can. Below is a list of foods and food groups in increasing order of being likely to give an allergic reaction. Start by giving the foods at the top and, as each one is cleared, move down the list.

Vegetables

Fruit (except oranges)

Nuts and seeds

Legumes and beans

Rice

Meat

Oats, barley, and rye

Oranges

Wheat

Milk products

Eggs



Introduce one or two foods each day and make a note of which ones you have given and any possible reaction, which may be anything from mild to severe eczema, excessive sleepiness, a runny nose, or colic, to an ear infection, excessive thirst, overactivity, or asthmatic breathing. If you notice a reaction, withdraw that food and carry on with new foods once the reaction has died down. You can double-check your observations a few months later; the reaction may disappear as the digestive system matures. The last four foods should not be introduced until your baby is nine or ten months old; this also applies to any foods that either parent is known to have a reaction to.





Baby food purees


Your partly weaned baby will still be getting plenty of nourishment from breast milk, and you may well find that you are breast-feeding as much as before. This is quite all right—in fact, mothers should ideally breast-feed a lot right up until the baby is a year old. Assuming your baby is getting most of his protein, fat, and carbohydrate from breast milk, you would do best to feed him plenty of vitamin- and mineral-rich vegetables and fruit. Simply cook a combination of vegetables or fruit (there is no need to add sugar) and puree them. Here are some good combinations:

Carrots alone

Cauliflower and turnip

Carrots, spinach, and cauliflower

Fava beans and cauliflower or carrot, plus a very little celery

Jerusalem artichokes and carrot

Peeled zucchini (the skins can be bitter) and fennel

Leek and potato

Rutabaga, turnip, and potato



Do experiment. To save time and effort, not to mention disappointment when your baby rejects your lovingly prepared purees, you can freeze these mixtures. Start by using ice trays for the tiniest amounts (you can also express breast milk and freeze it in sterilized ice trays to mix with purées and make them taste more like what your baby is used to) and progress to small jars and yogurt containers with lids.

You can slowly add other ingredients to these purees. Try red split lentils, cooked bean sprouts, well-cooked brown rice, black-eyed peas, other legumes, milk, cheese, yogurt, or soy milk. Breakfast can consist of more pureed vegetables—babies do not have to have sweet breakfast cereals or fruit, which only encourage a sweet tooth. As you introduce more cereals into the diet, you can cook brown rice flour as you would semolina and add pureed fruit for a lovely breakfast. An easier alternative is to pour some boiling water onto three teaspoons of fine oatmeal and leave this to stand for a few minutes. Pureed fruit, mashed banana, yogurt, or expressed breast or rice milk may be added. Millet flakes, which can be bought in health food shops, can be prepared in the same way as oatmeal. As the child gets older, quick oats may be used in place of oatmeal and the banana can be sliced instead of mashed.
