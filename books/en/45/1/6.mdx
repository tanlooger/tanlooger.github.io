title: 6. Antinutrients—Avoiding the Vitamin Robbers
---




Optimum nutrition is not just about what you eat—what you do not eat is equally important. Since the 1950s over thirty-five hundred man-made chemicals have found their way into manufactured food, along with pesticides, antibiotics, and hormone residues from staple foods such as grains and meat. Many of these chemicals are “antinutrients” in that they stop nutrients from being absorbed and used, or promote their excretion.

Gone are the days when healthy eating meant simply getting the right balance of nutrients from your food. Now an equally important part of the equation is avoiding harmful chemicals and protecting yourself against those that cannot be avoided. Many of today’s diseases are caused just as much by an excess of antinutrients as by a deficiency of nutrients. Take cancer, for example. Three-quarters of all cancers are associated with an excess of antinutrients, be it cancer-causing chemicals or excessive free radicals as a result of smoking. Many health problems, from arthritis to chronic fatigue, can follow from an overload of antinutrients exceeding the body’s capacity to detoxify itself. Once this threshold is exceeded, toxins such as pesticide residues accumulate in fat tissue, common drugs from alcohol to painkillers become increasingly toxic, and even the otherwise harmless by-products of the body making energy from carbohydrates start to accumulate, bringing on muscle aches and fatigue.

Nowadays in the U.S. alone we get through every year a staggering two million tons of food chemicals, one hundred nineteen billion alcoholic drinks, three hundred seventy-five billion cigarettes, four hundred million prescriptions for painkillers, and two hundred fifty million prescriptions for antibiotics. In addition, fifty thousand chemicals are released into the environment by industry and five hundred million gallons of pesticides and herbicides are sprayed onto food and pastures. Together, this constitutes a staggering onslaught of man-made chemicals and pollutants, with undeniable global health and environmental repercussions.





Making up the deficit


Even refined food that is free from artificial additives is not neutral. Any food you eat that requires more nutrients for the body to make use of it than the food itself provides is effectively an antinutrient. Living on these foods gradually robs the body of vital nutrients. In fact, two-thirds of the calories in the average person’s diet in the Western world come from these foods. That leaves one-third of the diet to provide not only enough nutrients for general health, but also enough to make up the deficit resulting from nutrient-deficient food and to combat other antinutrients, from car pollution to pesticides.

Exactly what extra quantities of key nutrients we need to combat these antinutrients is not known, but it is certainly well in excess of recommended daily allowance (RDA) levels. Take vitamin C, for example. How much does a smoker need to consume every day to have the same blood level of vitamin C as a nonsmoker, assuming they both start with the same dietary intake equivalent to the RDA level? The answer is in excess of 200 mg, roughly quadruple the RDA, according to research by Dr. Gerald Schectman and colleagues at the Medical College of Wisconsin.18 The same is true if you compare heavy drinkers with teetotalers. A heavy drinker needs to take in at least 500 mg a day, six times the RDA, to have the same vitamin C blood level as a nondrinker. And what about pollution? If you live or work in an inner city, what is your need for antioxidant protection? Certainly it will be higher than the RDA and, in the case of vitamin C, which detoxifies over fifty undesirable substances including exhaust fumes, a daily intake of 1,000 mg (1 gram) is more likely to be optimal.





Chemical self-defense


To a large extent, man-made chemicals have been allowed into the food chain as long as they have not been associated with any health risks. Their “antinutrient” status has never been an issue. Tartrazine or E102, one of the more common food-coloring agents, is a case in point. It has long been known to cause allergic reactions and hyperactivity in sensitive children, and Dr. Neil Ward and his team from the University of Surrey in England wanted to know why.19 They gave two groups of children identical-looking and identical-tasting drinks, except that one contained tartrazine. They measured the children’s mineral levels before and after they consumed the drink. Those who had the drink containing tartrazine became hyperactive and exhibited a decrease in their blood levels of zinc and an increase in the amount of zinc excreted in the urine. What the researchers had found was that tartrazine robbed the children of zinc, a deficiency of which is associated with increased risk of behavioral and immune system problems.

This is only one of hundreds of food chemicals to be tested in this way and, of course, it raises the question as to what safety criteria a chemical must meet before being allowed to enter the food chain. Or are new chemicals simply innocent until proven guilty? While the legislation on “novel foods” is becoming more stringent, the concept of testing for antinutrient effects is not yet on the checklist.





The pesticide problem


Labeling on food does not tell you everything. Unless you eat only organic food, one in three of all the foods you eat contains traces of pesticides.20 In fact, the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed by the average person in a year has the equivalent of up to one gallon of pesticides sprayed on it.

The first family of pesticides was organochlorines. These proved so toxic and nonbiodegradable that most have been banned in the U.S. and Europe (though not in many food-exporting developing countries). They were replaced by organophosphates, and in the United Kingdom alone more than ten tons of pesticides are now applied to crops every year. Many of these compounds are known to be carcinogenic, linked to birth defects or decreased fertility, and toxic to the brain and nervous system. Pesticide exposure is associated with depression, memory decline, aggressive outbursts, and Parkinson’s disease. According to Professor William Rea, director of the Environmental Health Center in Dallas, Texas, it is also linked to asthma, eczema, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, and rhinitis. We are exposed to pesticides not just in our food but also in our homes via pest control, as well as in the wider environment, especially if we live in or near agricultural areas, where there are now numerous campaigns to ban pesticide sprays drifting over neighboring communities.

You may be wondering why the government allows pesticides in foods if they are so harmful. The argument given is that at very low levels they are not harmful to humans, yet the tests used to establish the safety levels are done only on individual pesticides. No one has tested or can test the infinite number of combinations of pesticides we are all regularly exposed to. In 1998, three of every four lettuces tested carried more than one pesticide residue, and up to seven different compounds were found on individual lettuces.21 Multiple residues on other foods, including apples, pears, carrots, oranges, celery, and strawberries, are common, and of course several different foods are usually eaten at any given meal. It all adds up to a cocktail of pesticide residues, the combined toxicity of which is almost completely unknown.

Studies have shown that pesticides in combination may be hundreds of times more toxic than the same compounds alone.22 Also, individuals with poor detox function, the young, the elderly, and the stressed, are far more susceptible to toxins than the average healthy adult, so “safe levels” are relatively meaningless for many. Washing produce with water has little effect on these residues as most are formulated to resist being washed off by the rain. Tests with potatoes, apples, and broccoli have shown that between 50 and 93 percent of residues remained on produce after washing with water.23 You should aim to reduce your exposure to pesticides in your diet by choosing organic foods as often as you can.





Genetically engineered food


The long-term consequences on the ecosystem and on our health of genetically modified (GM) foods are also unknown. One of the main aims of the genetic engineers is to make crops such as soybeans or corn resistant to particular types of herbicide. In other words, the crop can be sprayed, all weeds will die, the plant will be contaminated, and the yield will be increased. Guess who profits from the increased sales of the herbicides and the GM seeds?

The biotechnology industry asserts that GM technology will reduce the use of herbicides on crops, yet analyses of the U.S. agricultural industry show that the use of herbicides has actually increased significantly since GM planting started in 1996. Although herbicide use decreased slightly in the first three years of GM crop growing, use increased subsequently. During 2002 and 2003 in the United States, an average of 29 percent more herbicide was applied per acre on GM herbicide-tolerant corn than on non-GM corn. Dr. Charles Benbrook of the Northwest Science and Environmental Policy Center in Sandpoint, Idaho, points out that GM “herbicide-tolerant crops have increased pesticide use an estimated seventy million pounds over the first eight years of cultivation.”24

We, the consumers, pay the price, while the farmers and agrochemical companies (who own both the patent for the new strain of soybean and the herbicide to which it is resistant) profit—and we are told that this technological advance is for the benefit of humanity! Consumer groups are campaigning for clear labeling to state when a food contains genetically engineered ingredients, and consumers are advised to avoid these products. Because pollen is carried by bees, insects, and the wind, contamination of other crops, including organic ones, will be inevitable if GM crops become widely grown.

The implications for human health and the environment remain unknown, though there are concerns that GM food could pose a serious health risk, with possible health problems involving antibiotic resistance, the creation of new toxins, and unexpected allergic reactions. The reality is that these concerns remain largely speculative because no one can predict what the outcome of the introduction of GM food into the food chain will be. No adequate safety tests have been carried out and no one is monitoring the impact of GM food on the diets of those countries now selling significant quantities of GM products for human consumption. Far too little is known about genes and DNA to predict what the possible unexpected effects of genetic engineering will be.

The only known trial of GM food on humans was commissioned by the British government’s Food Standards Agency and carried out by the University of Newcastle in 2002. Seven people were given a meal containing GM soy. It was found that in at least three people the GM material moved out of the food and entered their gut bacteria after only one meal! A Faustian feast, no less. Our gut bacteria perform an important role in digestion and any changes to their characteristics are a cause for concern.





Is your water fit to drink?


Water is not simply H2O. Natural water provides significant quantities of minerals: typical springwater, for instance, provides 100 mg of calcium per quart. The recommended daily intake of water is at least 1.5 to 2 quarts a day (that’s eight glasses), while for calcium it is 600 mg. So natural mineral water can provide a sixth of your calcium requirements. However, not all bottled water is the same. In the European Union (EU), only water that comes from an uncontaminated spring that has a consistent level of minerals across the seasons and the years (which means the source of the water is very deep and hence the water is very old) can be called “natural mineral water.” Other bottled water is not as reliable.

Tap water in a soft-water area provides as little as 30 mg of calcium a day. In addition, tap water contains significant levels of nitrates, trihalomethanes, lead, and aluminum, all antinutrients in their own right. In much of Britain and the United States, the levels of these antinutrients exceed safety limits. Approximately a quarter of all British tap water contains pesticides at levels above maximum admissible concentrations set by the EU for safety. Concerns over pollutants in water have led many people to switch to bottled, distilled, or filtered water. However, filtering or distilling water removes not only the impurities, but also many of the naturally occurring minerals. This again pushes up the need for minerals from food.





Out of the frying pan


What we do to food in the kitchen can alter the balance between nutrients and antinutrients. Frying food in oil produces what are known as free radicals, highly reactive chemicals that destroy essential fats in food and can damage cells, increasing the risk of cancer, heart disease, and premature aging, as well as destroying the very nutrients, such as vitamins A and E, that protect us from these dangerous substances.

The damaging effects of frying depend on the oil type, the temperature of the oil, and the length of time the food is fried. Ironically, it is the good polyunsaturated oils (see this page) that oxidize most rapidly, becoming undesirable trans fats. Frying with butter or coconut oil (saturated fat) or olive oil (monounsaturated fat) is therefore safer. Deep-frying is much worse than a two-minute sauté followed by adding a water-based sauce and putting a lid on the pan so the food “steam-fries” at a much lower temperature. Grilling, steaming, boiling, or baking, however, are better cooking methods than any form of frying. Finally, any form of overcooking will increasingly reduce the nutrient content of the food.

We used to think the main danger of frying was that fats cooked at high temperatures produce oxidants that are powerful cancer-promoting chemicals, hence the very strong association with burnt meat, rich in fat, whether fried or barbecued. However, alarming research has found another cancer-promoting substance, acrylamide, in foods cooked at high temperatures, with or without fat. While the safe limit set for acrylamide in food is ten parts per billion (ppb), French fries and potato chips have been found to contain more than one hundred times this amount!

The worst foods are fast-food French fries, potato chips, and crispbread. According to British research, Lay’s Classic Potato Chips averaged 1350 ppb and Pringles 1,500 ppb in surveys conducted in 2003. Ryvita contained between 1,340 and 4,000 ppb. In America, McDonald’s French fries, followed by Burger King’s, came out worst. However, even home-cooked French fries were found to be high. Acrylamide is produced by frying, barbecuing, baking, and even microwaving.

Anything browned or burnt, or cooked or processed using high heat, is therefore likely to be bad for you. The bottom line is this: Eat more raw food, and steam-fry or boil food, rather than cook it at a high heat. To steam-fry foods rather than stir-fry them, add a very small amount of olive oil to a pan and sauté the ingredients for literally a minute, just enough to generate enough heat so you can then add a water-based sauce, such as one-third each soy sauce, lemon juice, and water. This then steams the food when you put on the lid and gives you hot food, full of flavor, but not full of oxidants or acrylamide because nothing is burnt.

It is not just what is in your food that matters—what your food is in is also important. The mid-1990s scare concerning phthalates, substances used to soften plastics, being found in nine brands of infant food raised the question as to how significant quantities of such hormone-disrupting chemicals are finding their way into the food chain. Inspection of an average shopping cart will tell you how. Not only is fresh produce usually wrapped in soft plastics, but so also are drinks in cartons, which contain an inner plastic lining. An analysis of twenty brands of food in cans, now also lined with plastic, found significant levels of bisphenol A—some twenty-seven times higher than levels known to cause breast cancer cells to proliferate.

Unfortunately, plastics manufacturers are not required to state which chemicals are present in their products. Also, while the list of hormone-disrupting chemicals is growing, there is as yet no definitive list of what we should be avoiding and what is safe. For now, the best advice is to minimize the amount of food, especially wet or fatty food, that you buy in direct contact with soft plastic. Hard plastic is less likely to be a problem. So store cheese, for example, in a plastic container rather than wrapping it in plastic film, although you can now get “non-PVC” cling wrap.

What’s your antinutrient load?

Score 1 point for each yes answer.

Do you drink tap water?

Is more than half the food you eat not organic?

Do you spend an hour or more a day in traffic?

Do you live in a city?

Do you smoke or live or work with smokers?

Do you often eat fried food?

Do you eat nonorganic meat or fish or large fish like tuna or swordfish?

Do you take more than twenty painkillers in a year?

Do you take, on average, one course of antibiotics each year?

Is most of the food you eat or drink in contact with soft plastic or cling wrap?

Do you have an alcoholic drink on most days?



The ideal score is 0. A score of 5 or more means you are likely to be taking in a significant quantity of antinutrients. Any yes answer highlights areas in your diet and lifestyle that warrant attention.





Minimize pharmaceutical drugs


Many common medicines are also antinutrients. In Britain alone, 650 million prescriptions are written every year, and the total cost has doubled in the last ten years to £7 billion. The U.S. annual drug bill is a staggering $200 billion. In Britain, £260 million is spent each year on painkillers such as aspirin and acetaminophen (Tylenol).

Salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin and other painkillers, is a gastrointestinal irritant, increasing the permeability of the gut wall. This in turn upsets the absorption of nutrients, allowing incompletely digested foods to pass into the bloodstream, alerting the immune system and triggering allergy responses to common foods. In the long term, this weakens the immune system, encourages inflammation, and burns up vital vitamins and minerals needed for healthy immunity, as well as triggers intestinal bleeding.

The alternative is acetaminophen, of which four billion tablets are taken worldwide every year. While acetaminophen does not irritate the gut like aspirin, it is bad news for the liver. As a result, in Britain alone thirty thousand people a year end up in the hospital as a result of taking acetaminophen, and in 1994, 115 acetaminophen-related deaths were reported. According to Professor Sir David Carter of Edinburgh University, one in ten liver transplants is made necessary because of damage caused by acetaminophen overdose. While twenty acetaminophen can kill you, even one is extra work for the liver. If a person takes six a day and lacks the nutrients that help the liver to detoxify, this can reduce their ability to deal with other toxins such as alcohol. The combination of alcohol and acetaminophen is particularly dangerous; acetaminophen produces a toxic by-product that can be broken down by the liver only if the body contains sufficient stores of the amino acid glutathione. If you run out, the result is trouble.

Many common drugs have direct or indirect effects on your nutritional status. Antibiotics, for example, wipe out the healthy gut bacteria that manufacture significant amounts of B vitamins. They also pave the way for unfriendly bacteria to multiply, which increases the risk of infection, thereby stressing the immune system. This can then lead to nutrient deficiency. Meanwhile, the U.S. National Institutes of Health estimates that more than fifty thousand tons of antibiotics are used every year throughout the world.

In summary, the twentieth century has fundamentally changed the chemical environment of every species. Let us hope that the twenty-first century will pursue, with equal fervor, cleaning up the mess. As far as nutrition is concerned, we will all need to consider what optimum nutrition is, in the light not only of what our bodies need to be healthy, but also of what extra they need for antinutrient protection. There are also simple changes that we can make to our diets and lifestyles to reduce our environmental load, which is a fundamental principle of optimum nutrition.

Tips to help decrease your environmental load

Invest in a good-quality, plumbed-in water filter and replace the cartridge every six months. Jug filters are also good if you replace the cartridge as instructed. Or drink natural mineral water.

Buy organic food. When not possible, wash or peel fruits and vegetables.

Never deep-fry foods, and switch to steam-frying instead of sautéing.

Don’t use cling wrap unless it states “non-PVC.”

Rearrange your daily schedule to minimize time spent in traffic.

Drink alcohol very infrequently, and avoid smoky places.

Avoid medical drugs unless they are the only viable option for treating a health problem. If you get frequent infections or aches, investigate the underlying cause rather than relying on painkillers or antibiotics.
