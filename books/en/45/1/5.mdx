title: 5. Synergy—The Whole Is Greater
---




The science fiction of the 1960s envisaged a future in which humans would simply eat pills or powder containing the finite number of nutrients proved to be essential for the human machine to function. Yet, as each decade passes, we learn more and more about the complexities of the human body and nutrition. Of the fifty currently known essential nutrients (see this page), all interact with other nutrients and can be said to work in synergy.

Knowing this, it would be unrealistic to deprive a body of one nutrient, for experimental purposes, or to prescribe one nutrient for the treatment of disease. For example, deficiencies of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid and iron, zinc, and manganese can all contribute to anemia. Indeed, in some circumstances prescribing one nutrient can exacerbate deficiency of another. Iron is, for example, a zinc antagonist. Both are frequently deficient. Prescribing excessive amounts of iron exacerbates an undiagnosed or untreated zinc deficiency. Since zinc is a critical nutrient for fetal development, this could have serious detrimental effects during pregnancy.





Greater than the sum of the parts


Some nutrients simply will not work without their synergistic mates. Vitamin B6, pyridoxine, is useless in the body until it is converted into pyridoxal-5-phosphate, a job done by a zinc- and magnesium-dependent enzyme. If you are zinc or magnesium deficient and take a vitamin B6 supplement to help relieve premenstrual syndrome (PMS), it may not make any difference. Studies have shown that giving women zinc, magnesium, and B6 relieves the symptoms of PMS much more effectively.

The vast majority of research in nutrition, however, has looked at the effects on health of a single nutrient. The results are not comparable with the effects of giving a person optimum nutrition, the right balance of all essential nutrients. For instance, there is little evidence that individual vitamins or minerals can increase IQ scores in children. However, the combination of all vitamins and minerals, even if given only at recommended daily allowance (RDA) levels, has consistently been shown to produce a four- to five-point increase in children’s IQ scores.15 Similar combinations of vitamins, minerals, and essential fats have produced massive reductions in aggression in prison inmates, compared with placebo, in only two weeks.16 These kinds of results are simply not seen with individual nutrients.



Many nutrients work together to keep you healthy.

There are now hundreds of studies that show that the right nutrients in combination can produce improvements in health of a different league from those provided by individual nutrients. A classic example is the combination of B vitamins needed to lower homocysteine. This toxic protein in the blood is an incredible predictor of disease risk, not only for cardiovascular disease, but also for depression, Alzheimer’s disease, miscarriage and the risk of birth defects, and many more conditions (see chapter 16). Lowering homocysteine, and hence lowering risk, is easy if you know how. You need an optimal intake of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid, plus B2, zinc, magnesium, and trimethyl glycine (TMG).

Few medical studies, however, have taken this on board. Most just indicate that folic acid should be taken. This, by the way, is why folic acid is given during pregnancy—to lower homocysteine and reduce the risk of birth defects. So, let’s take a look at what happens if you give one, two, three, or all of these nutrients together. In a research study in Japan, patients with kidney disease, a condition strongly linked to high homocysteine, were divided into four groups: one was given folic acid alone, another B12 alone, another folic acid and B12 together, and another folic acid, B12, and B6 together. The trial lasted for three weeks.17

Here are the results of this remarkable study:





SUPPLEMENT GROUP HOMOCYSTEINE CHANGE

Folic acid alone

17.3% reduction



B12 alone

18.7% reduction



Folic acid plus B12

57.4% reduction



Folic acid, B12, and B6

59.9% reduction





Notice that this extraordinary study revealed two very important principles:

The more nutrients were provided, the greater was the reduction in homocysteine.

The right combination of nutrients at the right dose can more than halve your hymocysteine level and your risk for homocysteine-related conditions, such as heart attack and stroke, in as little as three weeks!



Notice also that no group was given all the nutrients that lower homocysteine, including B2, zinc, magnesium, and TMG. So we took six volunteers with raised homocysteine levels and gave them these nutrients. Their homocysteine levels dropped by 77 percent—more than four times as effective as the conventional medical prescription of folic acid to lower homocysteine. That is the power of synergy and that is why the results provided by optimum nutrition are in a different league from those you read about in single-nutrient trials designed by “pill for an ill” medics.

Another example of this is provided by the interplay of antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, glutathione, coenzyme Q10, lipoic acid, and anthocyanidins, which are abundant in berries. They have some effect in isolation but are much more effective when they work together. They, like all nutrients, are team players.



How antioxidants work together. A free radical, for example, from a French fry, is disarmed by vitamin E, which is recycled by vitamin C, which is recycled by glutathione, which is recycled by anthocyanidins. Coenzyme Q10, beta-carotene, and lipoic acid also help. These are the essential antioxidants and they work together.

In the figure above you can see why. Free-oxidizing radicals, sometimes called free radicals or oxidants, are the bad guys produced from anything burnt, be it a cigarette, exhaust fumes, fried fat, or burnt meat. The free radicals are like red-hot sparks that can damage your body. The antioxidants are like flameproof gloves that pass these hot potatoes along the line, gradually dissipating their potentially damaging properties. You need all of them to do the job properly, and that’s why I pay less attention to studies using just one nutrient than to multinutrient approaches.

The principle of synergy is a fundamental aspect of the optimum nutrition approach. This book enables you to assess your own needs taking into account the principle of synergy. You may achieve better results by eating the right foods and taking the right combination of nutrients at lower doses than those you have supplemented before. Such is the power of the synergistic effect of nutrients.

A few tips on nutrition synergy

There is no substitute for whole foods (any unrefined and unprocessed foods), which contain hundreds of health-promoting substances, the importance of many of which we have yet to discover.

Eat a varied diet, choosing from a wide range of different kinds of food.

Do not supplement your diet with individual nutrients without also taking a good all-round multivitamin and mineral supplement.

Do not take a large amount of an individual B vitamin without also taking a B complex or a multivitamin.

Do not supplement your diet with a large amount of an isolated antioxidant nutrient (for example, vitamin C, E, or beta-carotene) without also taking a good all-round multivitamin or antioxidant formula.
