Nutrient Fact File A to Z


What does each nutrient do? What are the symptoms of deficiency? How much should you take in from food and from supplements? How much is too much? These are the questions answered here for each key nutrient—vitamins, minerals, essential fats, and other key nutrients.

DV stands for Dietary Value and has now replaced Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as the basic measure you see on foods and supplements in the United States. It represents the minimum you need to not be overtly malnourished. The level given here is the average basic need for adults and children of 4 or more years of age. It does not represent your optimum.

ODA is the average optimum daily amount for an adult. In truth, there is a range of ODAs depending on the individual (see chapter 45 to define your needs).

SUPPLEMENTARY RANGE is the difference between this range and what you are likely to get from your diet. This defines the minimum you should supplement daily and the maximum, if your needs are very high. Supplementary ranges for babies and children, according to their age, are given in chapter 40.

TOXICITY is the level at which adverse effects can occur.

Best food sources lists foods with the highest nutrient amount per calorie, in descending order, with the figures in parentheses being the amount per 3.5 oz. serving. This tells you both which nutrient-rich foods to choose and how much you’ll be getting in a serving.

Best supplement details the most easily absorbed and used form of this nutrient.

Helpers and Robbers are the factors that assist or hinder absorption or utilization of this nutrient.
