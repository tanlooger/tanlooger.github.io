<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Balancing Hormones Naturally</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Some of the most powerful chemicals in the body are hormones. These are biochemicals produced in special glands and, when present in the bloodstream, they give instructions to body cells. Insulin, for example, tells the cells to take up glucose from the blood. Thyroxine, from the thyroid gland, speeds up the metabolism of cells, generating energy and burning fat. Estrogen and progesterone, from the ovaries, control a sequence of changes that maintain fertility and the menstrual cycle. Hormone imbalances can wreak havoc on your health.</p>
<p class="indent">Hormones are either fatlike, called steroid hormones, or proteinlike, such as insulin. They are made from components of your food, and diet can play a crucial part in keeping your hormone levels in balance. Most hormones work on feedback loops, with the pituitary gland as the conductor of the orchestra. For example, the pituitary releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which tells the thyroid gland to release thyroxine, which speeds up the metabolism of the cells in the body. When the blood level of thyroxine reaches a certain point, the pituitary stops producing TSH.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c25-s01"><strong>The thyroid gland and metabolism</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The thyroid hormone thyroxine is made from the amino acid tyrosine. The enzyme that converts one into the other is dependent on iodine, zinc, and selenium. A lack either of tyrosine or of iodine, zinc, or selenium can reduce thyroxine levels. However, an underactive thyroid, which can cause symptoms such as weight gain, mental and physical lethargy, constipation, and thickening skin, is quite common. Many people suspected of having thyroid problems have borderline “normal” thyroxine levels on being tested, but experience amazing health transformations after taking a low dose of thyroxine. Some people develop underactive thyroids because their body is destroying their thyroxine. These people test positive to “antithyroid antibodies.” <a id="page217"/>This is often due to gluten allergy. The immune system, it seems, becomes hypersensitive to a food and attacks thyroid tissue by mistake. Therefore, if you have an underactive thyroid, it’s worth testing yourself for allergies, as well as antithyroid antibodies.</p>

<h3 class="section" id="c25-s01-s01"><em>Maintaining calcium balance</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The thyroid gland also produces a hormone responsible for maintaining calcium balance in the body. Calcitonin from the thyroid works in balance with parathormone (PTH) from the parathyroid glands, four tiny glands attached to the thyroid. PTH converts vitamin D into an active hormone that helps increase available calcium. While most of the body’s calcium is in the bones, a small amount is in the blood and cells because every single nerve and muscle reaction uses calcium. PTH stimulates the bones to give up calcium, while calcitonin puts calcium back into the bones.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c25-s02"><strong>Stress and the adrenals</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys and produce hormones that, among other things, help us adapt to stress. The hormones adrenaline, cortisol, and DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) help us respond to emergencies by channeling the body’s energy toward being able to “fight or take flight,” improving oxygen and glucose supply to the muscles and generating mental and physical energy. It is a design that helped our remote ancestors cope with truly life-threatening situations.</p>
<p class="indent">During a stress reaction, the blood thickens to help wounds to heal. In modern life, all this happens when you open your bank statement to find you are overdrawn, get stuck in a traffic jam, or have an argument with your partner. Tea, coffee, chocolate, and cigarettes have the same effect as they contain caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, or nicotine, which stimulate the release of adrenaline. This instant energy has a downside. The body slows down digestion, repair, and maintenance to channel energy into dealing with stress. As a consequence, prolonged stress is associated with speeding up the aging process, with a number of the diseases of the digestion, and with hormone balance.</p>
<p class="indent">By living off stimulants such as coffee and cigarettes, a high-sugar diet, or stress itself, you increase your risk of upsetting your thyroid balance (which means your metabolism will slow down and you will gain weight) or calcium balance (resulting in arthritis) or of getting problems associated with sex-hormone imbalances and excessive Cortisol. These are the long-term side <a id="page219"/>effects of prolonged stress, because any body system that is overstimulated will eventually underfunction.</p>
<p class="indent">After only two weeks of the raised Cortisol levels of stress, the dendrite “arms” of brain cells that reach out to connect with other brain cells start to shrivel up, according to research carried out at Stanford University in California by Robert Sapolsky, professor of neuroscience.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c25-nts029" id="c25-nts029a"><sup class="frac">29</sup></a> The good news is that such damage isn’t permanent. Stop the stress and the dendrites grow back. One way to reduce your stress levels is to reduce your intake of sugar and stimulants. The more dependent on stimulants you are, the more your blood sugar levels fluctuate, with more “rebound” low blood sugar levels triggering the release of adrenal hormones. Your adrenals think you’re starving and go into “fight or flight” mode, when in truth you are just having a blood sugar dip as the body overcompensates after one more high-sugar food.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c25-s02-s01"><em>Nutrients for the stress hormones</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The stress hormones rely on certain nutrients for their production. For adrenaline you need enough of vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub> (niacin), B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and C. Cortisol, which is also a natural anti-inflammatory substance, cannot be produced without enough vitamin B<sub class="frac">5</sub> (pantothenic acid). Your need for all these nutrients, along with those needed for energy production such as vitamins B and C, goes up with prolonged stress.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c25-s02-s02"><em>Supplementing DHEA</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Levels of DHEA, a vital adrenal hormone, fall as a result of prolonged stress. This hormone, which can be bought over the counter in the United States, can be supplemented in small amounts to restore stress resistance.</p>
<p class="indent">A new kind of test can tell you where you are on the stress cycle. Saliva taken at five specific times of the day is analyzed to determine its levels of Cortisol and DHEA. DHEA can also be used to make the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen and is considered “antiaging.” However, too much can also overstimulate the adrenal glands and, for example, induce insomnia. So it is best not to take it unless you need it, as revealed by an adrenal stress test (see Resources).</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c25-s03"><strong>Sex hormones</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In women, the balance between progesterone and estrogen is critical. A relative excess of estrogen, called estrogen dominance, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and PMS. The early warning symptoms of estrogen dominance include PMS, depression, loss of sex drive, sweet cravings, heavy periods, weight gain, breast swelling, and water retention.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_048_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page220"/><strong><em>Hormones in the menstrual cycle</em></strong>. <em>In the first half of the menstrual cycle, a woman’s body produces estrogen, which makes the lining of the womb grow, ready to receive a fertilized egg. If the egg is released, the remaining sac then produces progesterone, which rises in the second half of the cycle, keeping the womb healthy. If no fertilized egg is implanted, the sac (the corpus luteum) shrivels up and progesterone levels plummet. This triggers menstruation</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Estrogen dominance can be due to excess exposure to estrogenic substances or a lack of progesterone or a combination of both. Estrogenic compounds are found in meat, much of which is hormone-fed; in dairy products; in many pesticides; and in soft plastics, some of which leach into food when used for wrapping. Estrogen is also contained in most birth control pills and HRT.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page221"/>If a woman does not ovulate, which ironically can be because of a slight lack of estrogen, no progesterone is produced. This is because progesterone is produced in the sac that contains the ovum, once the ovum is released. If no progesterone is produced, there is a relative estrogen dominance.</p>
<p class="indent">Stress raises levels of the adrenal hormone Cortisol, which competes with progesterone and lowers levels of DHEA, the precursor of progesterone. DHEA is also a precursor of testosterone, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that men too can suffer from estrogen dominance and testosterone deficiency. While men produce very little estrogen, they are exposed to this hormone in their diet and in the environment. Some substances, such as breakdown products of the pesticide DDT and Vinclozalin, used to spray lettuces, are known to interfere with the body’s testosterone, creating a deficiency. This may explain the increase in the incidence of genital defects and undescended testes in male infants and the rise in infertility as well as prostate and testicular cancer. In later life, some men have the equivalent of a “male menopause.” The symptoms, according to male-hormone expert Dr. Malcolm Carruthers, include fatigue, depression, decreased sexual performance, redistribution and gain in weight, including growth of excessive breast tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Prostaglandins, made from essential fatty acids, sensitize cells to hormones. There is considerable interaction between prostaglandins and hormones, especially sex hormones. Deficiency in essential fats, which is endemic in the Western world, or deficiency in the nutrients needed to convert essential fats into prostaglandins (vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, and C and biotin, magnesium, and zinc), can also create the equivalent of hormonal imbalances.</p>
<p class="indent">These nutrients, plus essential fats, have proved very helpful in relieving PMS and menopausal symptoms. So too have the herbs agnus castus, dong quai, black cohosh, and St. John’s wort. Vitamin E is also helpful for menopausal symptoms. One possible explanation is that vitamin E protects essential fats and prostaglandins from oxidation.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c25-s04"><strong>Balancing your hormones</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The following guidelines will help you keep your hormones in balance. However, if you are suffering from a major hormone imbalance such as estrogen dominance, it may be necessary also to take small amounts of natural progesterone. This is very different from synthetic progestins, which are included in some birth control pills and HRT, often in massive amounts in comparison to what the body naturally produces. Natural progesterone (and, for men, testosterone) is available only on prescription.</p>
<p class="center2"><a id="page222"/><strong>To keep your hormones in balance</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Keep animal fats very low in your diet.</li>
<li>Choose organic vegetables and meat wherever possible to reduce pesticide and hormone exposure.</li>
<li>Don’t eat fatty foods wrapped in PVC cling film.</li>
<li>Use stimulants such as coffee, tea, chocolate, sugar, and cigarettes infrequently, if at all. If you are addicted to any of these, break the habit.</li>
<li>Do not let stress become a habit in your life. Identify sources of stress and make some positive changes to your circumstances and the way you react to them.</li>
<li>Make sure you are getting enough essential fats from seeds, their oils, or supplements of evening primrose or borage oil (omega-6) or flax oil (omega-3).</li>
<li>Make sure your supplement program includes optimal levels of vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub> and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, biotin, magnesium, and zinc.</li>
<li>If you have PMS or menopausal symptoms, consider taking a hormone-friendly supplement containing extra vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, and C, and biotin, magnesium, and zinc, and/or the herbs agnus castus, dong quai, black cohosh, and St. John’s wort (see Resources).</li>
