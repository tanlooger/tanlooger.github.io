<h1 class="chapter" id="c13"><a id="page108"/><span class="big">13</span></h1>
<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Elemental Health from</strong> <strong>Calcium to Zinc</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">More than a hundred years ago, the Russian chemist Mendeleyev noticed that all the basic constituents of matter, the elements, could be arranged in a pattern according to their chemical properties. From this he produced what is known as the periodic table. There were many gaps where elements should be, and sure enough, over the years these missing elements have been discovered. All matter, including your body, is made out of these elements.</p>
<p class="indent">At normal temperature, some of these are gases, like oxygen and hydrogen; some are liquids; and some, such as iron, zinc, and chromium, are solids. Ninety-six percent of the body is made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, which form carbohydrate, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins. The remaining 4 percent is made from minerals.</p>
<p class="indent">These minerals are mainly used to regulate and balance our body chemistry; the exceptions are calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which are the major constituents of bone. These three, plus sodium and potassium, which control the water balance in the body, are called macrominerals because we need relatively large amounts each day (300 to 3,000 mg). The remaining elements are called trace minerals because we need only traces each day (30 mcg to 30 mg). But all these minerals are required in tiny amounts compared with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. For instance, a 140-pound man needs 400 grams (14 oz.) of carbohydrate a day but only 40 micrograms of chromium, which is less than a millionth of the amount. Yet chromium is no less important.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c13-s01"><strong>Mineral deficiency is widespread</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Minerals are extracted from the soil in the first place by plants. Like vitamins, they may be obtained directly from those plants or indirectly via meat. And, <a id="page109"/>again like vitamins, they are frequently deficient in our modern diets. There are three primary reasons for this.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s01-s01"><em>Mineral levels in natural foods are declining</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This is partly because soil gradually loses its mineral content through overfarming unless the farmer replaces the minerals by adding back mineral-rich manure. But many of the minerals that pass from plant to us are not needed to make the plant grow, so there is no incentive for the farmer to add them back. The minerals that are added back in fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium) make the plant grow faster and, in the case of phosphate, bind to trace minerals like zinc and make them harder for the plant to take up. Analyses of mineral levels in plants in 1939 compared with those in 1991 show, on average, a drop of 22 percent. (The accuracy of this data is, however, a little suspect as analytical methods have improved dramatically over this period.)</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s01-s02"><em>Essential minerals are refined out of food</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Refining food to make white rice, white flour, and white sugar removes up to 90 percent of the trace minerals. Foods like refined cereals must meet a legal minimum nutrient requirement and therefore have some calcium, iron, and B vitamins added back. To help sell them the package says “enriched” or “with added vitamins and minerals.” The irony is that the number of required vitamins and minerals keeps increasing. The United States now enriches flour with folic acid and Britain is thinking of following suit. This would not be necessary if the food we ate was not refined in the first place.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s01-s03"><em>Our mineral needs are increasing</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Dr. Stephen Davies from London’s Biolab Medical Unit has analyzed sixty-five thousand samples of blood, hair, and sweat over the past fifteen years. Without exception, the results, when looked at alongside the ages of the patients, show that levels of lead, cadmium, aluminum, and mercury are increasing, while those of magnesium, zinc, chromium, manganese, and selenium are decreasing. The first group is toxic minerals, antinutrients that compete with essential minerals. As we age, these toxic elements accumulate. Today we need more “good” minerals than ever to protect us from the unavoidable toxic minerals that reach us via polluted food, air, and water.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="center"><a id="page110"/><strong><span class="small2">MINERAL LOSS CAUSED BY FOOD PROCESSING</span></strong></p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_025_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">For these reasons, and because many of us choose to eat foods such as refined bread, pasta, and cereal and avoid the mineral-rich foods such as seeds and nuts, modern humans are mineral deficient. The average dietary intake of zinc (7.8 mg according to one survey) is a lot less than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 15 mg. The recommended intake for a breastfeeding woman is 25 mg, more than three times the average intake, leaving breast-fed infants hopelessly deficient in a mineral that is essential for all growth processes including intellectual development.</p>
<p class="indent">The average intake of iron is well below RDAs. The average intake is 10 mg compared with the RDA of 18 mg. While no RDAs exist for manganese, chromium, and selenium, dietary intakes are certainly below estimates of what we need for optimal health.</p>
<p class="indent">In animals such a state of mineral malnutrition is a known cause of a wide range of illnesses. For this reason livestock feed is enriched with minerals. Not so with humans. Is it any wonder we are not healthy?</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_023_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>Percentage of minerals lost in refining flour</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c13-s02"><a id="page111"/><strong>The macrominerals</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The minerals that are present in the body in relatively large amounts include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s02-s01"><em>Calcium—the bone builder</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Nearly 3 pounds of your body weight is calcium, and 99 percent of this is in your bones and teeth. Calcium is needed to provide the rigid structure of the skeleton. It is particularly important in childhood when bones are growing and also in the elderly because the ability to absorb calcium becomes impaired with age. The remaining 10 or so grams of calcium are found in the nerves, muscles, and blood. Working together with magnesium, calcium is needed to enable nerves and muscles to “fire.” It also assists the blood in clotting and helps maintain the right acid-alkaline balance.</p>
<p class="indent">The average Western diet provides marginally more than the RDA for calcium. Most of it comes from milk and cheese, which are poor sources. However, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and water provide significant quantities of both calcium and magnesium, and it is likely that our ancestors relied on these for their calcium.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_026_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>Calcium—how much is absorbed?</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page112"/>The ability to use calcium depends not only on its intake but also on its absorption. The amount absorbed depends on the food, but is normally around 20 to 30 percent. The calcium balance of the body is improved by adequate vitamin D intake and by weight-bearing exercise. It is made worse by vitamin D deficiency, exposure to lead, consumption of alcohol, coffee, and tea, or a lack of hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach. The presence of naturally occurring chemicals called phytates, which are found in grains, and excessive phosphorus or fat in the diet also interferes with absorption. Excessive protein consumption also causes loss of calcium from the bones.</p>
<p class="indent">Symptoms of deficiency include muscle cramps, tremors, or spasms, insomnia, nervousness, joint pain, osteoarthritis, tooth decay, and high blood pressure. Severe deficiency causes osteoporosis. However, this is more likely to be connected with protein and excess hormone imbalances (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c08_r1.htm">chapters 8</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c20_r1.htm">20</a>).</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s02-s02"><em>Magnesium—calcium’s comrade in arms</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Magnesium works with calcium in maintaining both bone density and nerve and muscle impulses. The average diet is relatively high in calcium but deficient in magnesium, because milk, our major source of calcium, is not a very good source of magnesium. Both minerals are present in green, leafy vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Magnesium is a vital component of chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color and is therefore present in all green vegetables. However, only a small proportion of the magnesium within plants is in the form of chlorophyll.</p>
<p class="indent">Magnesium is essential for many enzymes in the body, working together with vitamins B<sub class="frac">1</sub> and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. It is also involved in protein synthesis and is therefore essential for production of some hormones. It may be its role in hormone production or prostaglandin production that is responsible for its beneficial effects on premenstrual problems.</p>
<p class="indent">A lack of magnesium is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease: people who die from this cause have abnormally low levels of the mineral in their hearts. Lack of magnesium causes muscles to go into spasm, and there is considerable evidence that some heart attacks are caused not by obstruction of the coronary arteries but by cramping of them, resulting in the heart being deprived of oxygen.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s02-s03"><em>Sodium—for nerve transmission and water balance</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium is eaten mainly in the form of sodium chloride, more familiarly known as salt; there is 92 grams of sodium in the human body. More than half <a id="page113"/>is in the fluids surrounding cells, where it plays a vital role both in nerve transmission and in the maintenance of water concentration in blood and body fluids.</p>
<p class="indent">Sodium deficiency is exceedingly rare, because too much is added to foods and also because its excretion is carefully controlled by the kidneys. It is present in small amounts in most natural foods and is mainly supplied in processed foods. There is no need to add it to food and good reasons not to. Excess sodium is associated with raised blood pressure, although it appears that some people are not salt-sensitive in this way. As sodium levels in the body rise, fluids are made less concentrated by retaining more water. This gives rise to edema or fluid retention.</p>
<p class="indent">Not all salts are bad news. One I sometimes use is Solo salt. This is a type of sea salt that has 46 percent less sodium, and more potassium and magnesium, than other types of salt. A study in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> gave this salt to people with high blood pressure and blood sugar came down.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c13-nts028" id="c13-nts028a"><sup class="frac">28</sup></a> This is because potassium and magnesium are good news as far as the arteries and your blood pressure are concerned.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s02-s04"><em>Potassium—sodium’s partner</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This mineral works in conjunction with sodium in maintaining water balance and proper nerve and muscle impulses. Most of the potassium in the body is inside the cells. The more sodium (salt) is eaten, the more potassium is required, and since the average daily intake of potassium is only 4 grams, relative deficiency is widespread. The same level of intake of these two minerals is more consistent with good health. Fruit, vegetables, and whole grains are rich in potassium.</p>
<p class="indent">Severe potassium deficiency may result in vomiting, abdominal bloating, muscular weakness, and loss of appetite. Potassium deficiency is most likely to occur in people taking diuretic drugs or laxatives or using corticosteroid drugs over a long period.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c13-s03"><strong>The trace minerals</strong></h2>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s01"><em>Iron—the oxygen carrier</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Iron is a vital component of hemoglobin, which transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from cells. Sixty percent of the iron within us is in the form of red pigment or heme. This is the form present in meat and is much more readily absorbed than the nonheme iron present in nonmeat food sources. Nonheme iron occurs in the oxidized or ferric state in food and not <a id="page114"/>until it is reduced to the ferrous state (for example by vitamin C) during digestion can it be absorbed.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of iron deficiency include pale skin, sore tongue, fatigue or listlessness, loss of appetite, and nausea. Anemia is clinically diagnosed by checking hemoglobin levels in the blood. However, symptoms of anemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub> or folic acid. Iron-deficiency anemia is most likely to occur in women, especially during pregnancy. Since iron is an antagonist to zinc, increasing the requirement for zinc, supplements containing more than 30 mg of iron—almost twice the RDA—should not be taken without ensuring that enough zinc is also being consumed. Although iron supplements are often given in doses above 50 mg, there is little evidence that this is more effective than lower doses in raising hemoglobin levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Too much iron may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. According to a Finnish study of 1,900 men, those with higher iron stores were more than twice as likely to have a heart attack as those with lower iron stores. Jerome Sullivan, a pathologist at the Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center in South Carolina, found a correlation between blood ferritin levels (most iron reserves in the body are stored as ferritin) and cardiovascular risk and thinks that this might explain why menstruating women, who lose iron each month, have a lesser risk of cardiovascular disease than men up until menopause.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c13-nts029" id="c13-nts029a"><sup class="frac">29</sup></a> This theory is yet to be proven, but it suggests that meat-eating men should not go overboard on iron supplements. In practice, this means limiting the dose to 10 mg a day unless you are deficient.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s02"><em>Zinc—a major role player</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">A large part of the population is at risk of being zinc-deficient. With half the population eating less than half the recommended daily allowance (RDA), few people get enough from their diet. Deficiency symptoms are white marks on the nails, lack of appetite or lack of appetite control, pallor, infertility, lack of resistance to infection, poor growth (including hair growth), poor skin including acne, dermatitis, and stretch marks, plus mental and emotional problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Zinc deficiency plays a role in nearly every major disease, including diabetes and cancer. Zinc is needed to make insulin, to boost the immune system, and to make the antioxidant enzyme SOD (superoxide dismutase). It is also required to make prostaglandins from essential fatty acids. These hormonelike substances help balance hormones and control inflammation and the stickiness of the blood. Sucking zinc lozenges helps shorten the life of a cold.</p>
<p class="indent">Zinc’s main role is the protection and repair of DNA, and for this reason it is found in higher levels in animals and fish than in plants—animals have higher levels of DNA. A vegetarian diet may therefore be low in zinc. Stress, smoking, and alcohol deplete zinc, as does frequent sex, at least for men, since semen contains very high concentrations of zinc. Oysters are popularly said to be aphrodisiacs. They are also the highest dietary source of zinc, providing about 15 mg per oyster, and for both men and women zinc is essential for fertility.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_027_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page115"/><em>How much iron is absorbed?</em></p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s03"><em>Manganese—the forgotten mineral</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This mineral is known to be involved in no fewer than twenty enzyme systems in the body. One of the most critical is SOD, which acts as an antioxidant, helping disarm free radicals. In animals, manganese deficiency results in reduced insulin production. Since diabetics frequently have low manganese levels, it is thought to be involved in maintaining blood sugar balance. It is also involved in the formation of mucopolysaccharides, a constituent of cartilage. One of the first signs associated with deficiency is joint pain.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page116"/>Manganese is also required for proper brain function. Deficiency has been associated with schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy. It is frequently deficient in the diet and the best sources include tropical fruit, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Tea is also a significant source of this mineral and can supply half our daily intake. Little more than 5 percent of the manganese eaten in the diet is absorbed, though exactly why is unknown. Similarly, supplements are poorly absorbed, the best forms being manganese citrate or manganese amino acid chelate.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s04"><em>Copper—good and bad</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Both a nutritional and a toxic element, copper is required by humans in doses as little as 2 mg a day. It is rarely deficient for the simple reason that most water supplies are contaminated by copper pipes. It is needed among other things for the formation of the insulating myelin sheath around nerves. Copper and zinc are strongly antagonistic, and zinc deficiency may lead to a greater uptake of copper. Likewise, excessive zinc supplementation can induce copper deficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">In reality, excess is a more common problem than deficiency. If you are on a whole-food diet, there is no actual need to supplement copper, yet it is often included in multimineral tablets. A good multi should contain roughly ten times more zinc than copper (for example, zinc 10 mg, copper 1 mg). Taking birth control pills or HRT also increases your copper stores. All these factors make it relatively easy to accumulate too much copper, which is associated with schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease, and possibly rheumatoid arthritis. However, copper deficiency has also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Copper is a constituent of an antioxidant enzyme involved in some inflammatory reactions. This may be the reason why too much or too little can result in greater inflammation in sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis. Copper levels rise during pregnancy, and it is speculated that it plays a role in bringing on labor and, in excess, postnatal depression.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s05"><em>Chromium—the energy factor</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This is a vital constituent of glucose tolerance factor, a compound produced in the liver that helps transport glucose from the blood to the cells. vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> and the amino acids glycine, glutamic acid, and cystine are also required for glucose tolerance factor. Continued stress or frequent sugar consumption therefore deplete the body of chromium. A diet high in refined foods is also likely to be deficient in this mineral since it is found in whole grains, legumes, <a id="page117"/>nuts, seeds, and especially in mushrooms and asparagus. Chromium supplements have been used successfully in the treatment of diabetes and glucose intolerance.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c13-s03-s06"><em>Selenium—the anticancer mineral</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Deficiency of this mineral was first discovered in China as the cause of Keshan disease, a type of heart disease prevalent in areas in which the soil was deficient in selenium. It has since been associated with another regional disease, this time in Russia, involving joint degeneration. Perhaps the most significant finding is selenium’s association with a low risk of certain kinds of cancer.</p>
<p class="indent">Selenium is the vital constituent of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. A tenfold increase in dietary selenium causes a doubling of the quantity of this enzyme in the body. Since many oxides are cancer-producing, and since cancer cells destroy other cells by releasing oxides, it is likely to be selenium’s role in glutathione peroxidase production that gives it protective properties against cancer and premature aging. It may also be essential for the thyroid gland, which controls the body’s rate of metabolism. Selenium is found predominantly in whole foods, particularly seafood and sesame seeds. If you grind the seeds, the nutrients become more readily available.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c13-s04"><strong>The unknown minerals</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">As research unfolds and analytic techniques improve, we will probably find that many more minerals have an important role to play. Some are already proven, although not widely known. They include boron, which helps the body use calcium and may be beneficial for arthritis sufferers; molybdenum, which helps remove undesirable free radicals, petrochemicals, and sulfites from the body and is therefore useful for city dwellers who want protection from pollution; vanadium, proved to be essential in some animals, which may be useful for the treatment of manic depression; and germanium, which has antioxidant potential.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the 1970s, analytical chemists have moved from being able to detect minerals in food, blood, hair, and so on, at a level of one part in a million, to being able to detect one part in a trillion—that’s a millionth of a million, or the equivalent of dissolving a lump of sugar in the Mediterranean and being able to detect the difference. It is highly likely that we have much more to learn about the magic of minerals.</p>
