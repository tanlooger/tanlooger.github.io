<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Fighting Infections</strong> <strong>Naturally</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Prevention is better than cure and, as Louis Pasteur said on his deathbed, the host is more important than the invader. Medical scientists are increasingly finding that we succumb to bugs only when we are run-down, so your best line of defense is to keep your immune system strong so that it is ready to attack when an invader comes along (read <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c24_r1.htm">chapter 24</a> on boosting the immune system). Invaders come in many shapes and sizes: there are bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as parasites. It is important to know which you are dealing with, as each requires slightly different treatment. A cold, flu, herpes, and measles are all viruses. Most ear infections, stomachaches, and chest and sinus infections (usually following a cold) are bacterial. Thrush and athlete’s foot are fungal infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Immune-boosting nutrients are good year-round, especially if you are rundown or exposed to people with infections. During an infection, both the invader and our own immune army produce free radicals to destroy each other. We can minesweep these dangerous chemicals with antioxidant nutrients, which are good for everybody at any time. Antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents are best increased when dealing with a specific invader. Judging by the results of research on vitamin C, it would be wrong to believe that immune-healthy people get no infections. They just have “precolds” that are all over in twenty-four hours, where less healthy people end up horizontal for a week. So the aim is to boost your immune system by giving it the right food and the right environment, so it can adapt quickly to attempted invasions.</p>
<p class="indent">While vitamin C’s main strength is against viruses, grapefruit seed extract, for example, is antibacterial or “antibiotic.” The table below shows which natural remedies work best against different kinds of invaders (see also the A to Z of natural infection-fighters on <a class="hlink" href="#page291">this page</a>).</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page288"/><strong><span class="small2">WHICH INVADERS, WHICH NATURAL REMEDY?</span></strong></p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_056_r1.jpg"/></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c33-s01"><strong>Get in fast</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The best form of defense is attack, and the quicker you get in there the more chance you have of restoring your health before an infection sets in. All invaders produce toxins as part of their weapons of war. If you wake up feeling more tired than usual, perhaps with bloodshot eyes, a slight headache, <a id="page289"/>itchy throat, slightly blocked nose, or foggy brain—and you haven’t been drinking the night before—you are probably under attack! Just as when you have consumed alcohol, these are signs that your body is trying to eliminate an undesirable agent. If the war is raging, turn up the heat.</p>
<p class="indent">The immune system works best in a warm environment, which is why the body creates a fever to turn up the temperature. So keep yourself warm and get plenty of rest. One day taking it easy can make all the difference, especially if you boost your immune army with natural remedies. Lack of sleep depletes your energy reserves. Also avoid all the other ways in which we habitually dissipate energy: alcohol consumption, exposure to smoky atmospheres, strong sunlight and stress, overeating, engaging in arguments, overexertion, having sex, and taking antibiotics. You can tilt the balance in your favor by reducing these energy robbers.</p>
<p class="indent">There is some truth in the old saying “Starve a fever, feed a cold.” During an infection, listen to your body. It is fine not to eat for a day, but if an infection goes on for a long time, your immune system does need a number of nutrients, plus protein, to replenish the troops. It is best to eat lightly—small meals made from high-energy natural foods, raw or lightly cooked. During an infection, the body fights hard to eliminate the waste products of war, so drink plenty of water or herb tea to help your body detoxify and reduce mucus. Avoid salt and mucus-forming and fatty foods, such as meat, eggs, and dairy products.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c33-s02"><strong>How to kill a cold</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">There is some dispute among nutritionists about the effect of vitamin C on the common cold. At an amount below 1 gram of vitamin C a day, there is little evidence of substantial reduction in colds. At 1 gram a day, some studies show fewer colds, and most studies show shorter or less severe colds.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c33-nts051" id="c33-nts051a"><sup class="frac">51</sup></a> I estimate that the optimal daily intake of vitamin C for cold prevention, especially if you are over forty, have a stressful lifestyle, live in a city, and meet lots of people, is 2 grams a day.</p>
<p class="indent">While 1 or 2 grams of vitamin C a day helps to reduce the severity and incidence of colds, achieving “tissue saturation” during a cold has even greater results. In order to take hold, a cold virus must get inside cells and reprogram them to make more cold viruses, which then infect other cells. However, if the body’s tissues are high in vitamin C, the virus cannot survive. Tissue saturation is more likely to be achieved by taking in around 10 to 15 grams a day, or 2 grams every four hours, which is 250 times <a id="page290"/>the recommended daily allowance (RDA)! Fortunately vitamin C is one of the least toxic substances known. A daily intake of 2 to 3 grams, spread out through the day, may be sufficient to maintain a high level of immune protection.</p>
<p class="indent">Viruses get into body cells by puncturing their walls with tiny spikes made of a substance called hemagglutinin. According to research by virologist Madeleine Mumcuoglu, working with Dr. Jean Linderman, who discovered interferon, an extract of elderberry disarms these spikes by binding to them and preventing them from penetrating the cell membrane. “This was the first discovery,” says Mumcuoglu. “Later I found evidence that elderberry also fights flu virus in other ways. Viral spikes are covered with an enzyme called neuraminidase, which helps break down the cell wall. The elderberry inhibits the action of that enzyme. My guess is that we’ll find elderberry acts against viruses in other ways as well.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c33-nts052" id="c33-nts052a"><sup class="frac">52</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In a double-blind controlled trial she tested the effects of the elderberry extract on people diagnosed with any one of a number of strains of flu virus. The results, published in 1995, showed a significant improvement in symptoms—fever, cough, muscle pain—in 20 percent of patients within twenty-four hours, and in a further 73 percent of patients within forty-eight hours. After three days, 90 percent had complete relief from their symptoms compared with another group on a placebo, who look at least six days to recover. While this is the first published trial of elderberry extract, I have heard many success stories from my clients who have successfully speeded up recovery from colds and flu by taking elderberry extract.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c33-s03"><strong>Immune-boosting herbs</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">More and more immune-boosting herbs are being discovered to help fight infections. Four excellent ones, covered in greater detail in the list below, are cat’s claw, echinacea, garlic, and grapefruit seed extract. Cat’s claw tea tastes good with added black currant and apple concentrate, and one cup a day helps maintain immune power. If you have a sore throat or stomach upset, add four slices of root ginger. Echinacea is the original Native American “snakeroot”, which later became known as snake oil. The great advantage of grapefruit seed extract is that it has a similar effect to antibiotics but without damaging beneficial gut bacteria as conventional antibiotics do. Even if you are taking probiotics like acidophilus, it is best to take them separately from grapefruit seed extract.</p>
<p class="center2"><a id="page291"/><strong>Steps to help you fight an infection</strong> <strong>(for more specific information on dosages see the list further below)</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Eat lightly, making sure you get enough protein, which is needed to build immune cells, and keep warm. If you have a mucus-related infection, avoid dairy products.</li>
<li>Increase your intake of vitamin C to 3 grams every four hours.</li>
<li>Drink cat’s claw tea and consider adding ginger and echinacea drops and taking garlic capsules or cloves.</li>
<li>If you have a cold, take one tablespoon of Sambucol four times a day.</li>
<li>If you have a bacterial, fungal, or parasitical infection, take ten drops of grapefruit seed extract two or three times a day.</li>
<li>Find out what your infection is and, if necessary see your doctor, especially if you are not better within five days.</li>
<li>Consider other remedies in the A to Z of natural infection fighters below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c33-s04"><strong>A to Z of natural infection fighters</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Two doses are given below: the first for pulling out the plug when under attack, the second for general maintenance. Once an invasion is over, wait forty-eight hours before going on to the maintenance dose. Some natural remedies have no maintenance dose and are recommended only to fight an infection.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c33-s04-s01"><em>Vitamin A</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Vitamin A is one of the key immune-boosting nutrients. It helps strengthen the skin, inside and out, and therefore acts as a first line of defense, keeping the lungs, digestive tract, and skin intact. By strengthening cell walls, it keeps viruses out. Vitamin A can be toxic in large doses, so levels above 10,000 IU are recommended only on a short-term basis.</p>
