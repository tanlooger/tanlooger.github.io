<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Turning Back the Clock</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">The quest for immortality, or at least extended life span, is nothing new. Since the beginning of history, myths and legends about magic potions and immensely long-lived people have abounded. Now, however, many scientists and gerontologists (gerontology is the study of aging) are predicting that a life span of 110 years will soon be commonplace.</p>
<p class="indent">To date, the oldest person ever recorded is Madame Jeanne Calmant from Aries in France, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, thus breaking the record of a Japanese fisherman named Izumi, who died at the age of 120 having been essentially healthy and active until he was 113. A bit of a rogue as far as healthy living is concerned, Madame Calmant was not a health fanatic, gave up smoking at the age of 117, and drank two glasses of port every day until her last decade. With most of her relatives and family living to ripe old ages, scientists think she was genetically strong and maintained a good mental attitude, resisting stress and depression. However, the most significant factor in increasing your chances for a long and healthy life is what you eat—or do not eat.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s01"><strong>Preventing premature death</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The vast majority of people die from preventable diseases. The U.S. Surgeon General states that “of the 2.2 million Americans who die each year 1.8 [million] die from diet-related diseases.” Three-quarters of all deaths are caused by cancer, heart disease, bronchial infections, Alzheimer’s, or accidents. Eradicate these and you instantly extend your probable healthy life span by ten to twenty-five years, the key words being “healthy life span.” By preventing these diseases, and all the degenerative changes that lead up to them, <a id="page270"/>through optimum nutrition, you effectively turn back the clock and slow down the aging process.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the challenge that has occupied gerontologists is not how to prevent the diseases responsible for premature aging and death, but to discover what determines the maximum possible life span. Why, for example, can an elephant live a hundred years or more, while most insects have a life span of days? The big question, of course, is how we can extend the maximum possible life span.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s02"><strong>Extending your maximum life span</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">While the likely maximum life span of a human being is in the region of 110 to 120 years or more, you may be surprised to know that a proven method already exists for extending this length of time. It is, at least, proven in all animal species so far tested, and it is achieved by restricting calorie intake while providing optimum nutrition.</p>
<p class="indent">Pioneered by Dr. Roy Walford, calorie restriction has been shown to promote health, reduce disease, and extend life span by 10 to 300 percent. Studies with fish have achieved a remarkable 300 percent extension, while with rats the maximum increase has been 60 percent.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c31-nts022" id="c31-nts022a"><sup class="frac">22</sup></a> Although this effect has been proved in many species by U.S. government-backed research groups, it is too soon to complete human trials, but there is little doubt that the same approach will produce results. The unknown factor is, How much calorie restriction, and at what level, is required to produce a result? Even a 10 percent extension means increasing maximum life span to over 130 years—a concept now accepted by many gerontologists, although considered fantasy twenty years ago.</p>
<p class="indent">Ongoing research is aimed at discovering why optimum nutrition with calorie restriction is so effective, and the answer to this question, once found, will probably shed light on the process of aging. Current theories focus on the energy factories within cells, called mitochondria. The mitochondria are responsible for the rate of metabolism or energy production. The harder they work, the more oxidizing free radicals are produced (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c15_r1.htm">chapter 15</a>), which in turn age the mitochondria and have the potential to damage the cell’s DNA, the blueprint for new cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Ron Hart from the National Institutes of Health has demonstrated that the aging of species is also linked to the ability to repair DNA. According to Professor Denham Harman, from the University of Nebraska Medical School, the “chances are 99 percent that free radicals are the basis for aging.” There is growing consensus that the process of aging hinges on declining ability to repair the damage caused by free radicals.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page271"/>This also means that the key to longevity lies in reducing our exposure to free radicals and increasing the body’s protection against them by increasing our intake of antioxidants. When animals are given very high-quality, low-calorie diets, this is exactly what is achieved. They receive exactly what they need in the way of fuel, so there is no wasted “burning” by the body—this process is the major generator of free radicals, the toxic by-product of energy metabolism. By being provided with optimum nutrition, especially a high intake of antioxidant nutrients, the animals have both maximum protection from free radicals and all the cofactor nutrients necessary to make sure that energy metabolism takes place as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">While the roles of antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E are well known, there are other important antioxidant nutrients. Two of these are lipoic acid and carnitine. Studies involving the feeding of these to old rats have shown amazing reversals of aging.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c31-nts023" id="c31-nts023a"><sup class="frac">23</sup></a> Professor Bruce Ames, a molecular biologist at the University of California, who led this research, said of the animals who had been on supplements of lipoic acid plus acetyl-L-carnitine, “The brain looks better, they are full of energy—everything we looked at looks like a younger animal. It’s the equivalent of making a seventy-five- to eighty-year-old person act middle-aged.”</p>
<p class="indent">But can we apply all this to humans? To date, the circumstantial evidence is remarkably consistent across a wide variety of species and there is no reason to believe that humanity will be any different. Longevity, or the risk of mortality, correlates very well with blood levels or dietary intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A, and beta-carotene.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, in a study published in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>, which followed 11,178 people between the ages of 67 and 105 over ten years, the overall risk of death was reduced by 42 percent for those who took supplements of both vitamin C and vitamin E.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c31-nts024" id="c31-nts024a"><sup class="frac">24</sup></a> This is a remarkable finding that confirms earlier studies. What is not known, however, is how much of the reduction is due to the prevention of premature death from disease and how much to the extension of the maximum life span.</p>
<p class="indent">In practical terms, there is only one way to maximize your life span, having reduced the risk of dying prematurely from disease. Restrict calories and nourish yourself optimally, especially where antioxidants are concerned.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s03"><strong>Eat less, live longer</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">It is more than likely that the leaner you are the longer you will live. Calorie restriction, however, is not the same as malnutrition. It is about giving the body exactly what it needs and no more. Many foods in today’s diet provide “empty” calories—sugar or saturated fat, but none of the micronutrients <a id="page272"/>needed to process them. These foods are out if you want to extend your life span. Nutrient-dense foods such as organic carrots, apples, nuts, and seeds provide as many nutrients as calories plus, in the case of fresh fruit and vegetables, plenty of essential and calorie-free water.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to restrict calories is simply to eat less. Another is to fast or have a modified fast one day a week. This may mean, for example, just eating fruit. I keep my overall calorie intake low by eating a substantial breakfast and dinner but a small lunch (sometimes no lunch at all) and snacking on fruit throughout the day. Life insurance companies are well aware of the correlation between weight and longevity. Weight charts give an ideal weight range for your height; generally, the ideal weight for increased life expectancy is at the low end of this range. What really counts is keeping down the percentage of your body weight that consists of fat.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s04"><strong>Lower your homocysteine</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Aging isn’t determined just by oxidation, which damages cells. It’s also determined by methylation. This fundamental process, explained in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a>, is vital for repairing DNA in your cells and picking up the right information in the first place. How good you are at methylation, which is best reflected by measuring your homocysteine level, determines how long you’ll live.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a>, I told you about the extraordinary findings of a comprehensive research study at the University of Bergen in Norway, published in 2001.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c31-nts025" id="c31-nts025a"><sup class="frac">25</sup></a> The researchers measured the homocysteine levels of 4,766 men and women, aged sixty-five to sixty-seven in 1992, and then recorded any deaths over the next five years, during which 162 men and 97 women died. They then looked at the risk of death in relation to their homocysteine levels. They discovered that “a strong relation was found between homocysteine and all causes of mortality.” In other words, homocysteine is an accurate predictor of death, whatever the cause.</p>
<p class="indent">What they found was that the chances of a person of sixty-five to sixty-seven years dying from any cause increased by almost 50 percent for every 5-unit increase in homocysteine! This strongly reflects how central homocysteine and methylation are to the underlying causes of the common diseases that kill most of us prematurely in the twenty-first century. Turn this equation around and what it suggests is that if, for example, your homocysteine level was 15, and you drop it to 6 units or less and maintain it there, you can probably add around ten years to your life! And it will be a lively decade because, as you will see, if you lower your homocysteine level below 6 units with the proper balance of diet and supplementation, and alleviate <a id="page273"/>your methylation problems, your cells will age more slowly, you’ll have increased vitality, and you’ll feel younger than your years. In practical terms, this means eating more greens and beans and supplementing B vitamins. See <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a> for the full strategy for keeping your hymocysteine score low.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s05"><strong>Exercise keeps you young</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Regular exercise can add seven years to your life span, conclude Dr. Rose and Dr. Cohen of the Veterans’ Administration Hospital in Boston. But the exercise must be continued late into life and must be aerobic—that is, your heart rate must reach 80 percent of its maximum for at least twenty minutes. Cycling, swimming, and running are good; weight lifting and strengthening exercises, on the other hand, do little to extend your life. Aerobic exercise reduces blood cholesterol levels, pulse rate, and blood pressure, promoting better cardiovascular health as well as increasing mental function. It also helps you maintain proper blood sugar control and is therefore especially helpful for diabetics.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c31-s06"><strong>Keeping cool</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">One method of extending life span in animals has yet to prove practical or popular: it involves lowering the body temperature. Certain drugs have the ability to do this, but have undesirable side effects.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping cool in terms of avoiding stress, however, may prove to be an important life-extension factor. Prolonged stress causes depletion of the adrenal hormone DHEA. Low DHEA levels are associated with an increased risk of many killers, including Alzheimer’s, cancer, and heart disease, and of aging in general. DHEA also helps the body burn fat and stay lean. DHEA levels, if low, can be restored by supplementation. Nutrition consultants can determine your DHEA status through analysis of saliva samples. Although freely available in the United States, DHEA is not available over the counter in the UK, where it is classified as a medicine.</p>
