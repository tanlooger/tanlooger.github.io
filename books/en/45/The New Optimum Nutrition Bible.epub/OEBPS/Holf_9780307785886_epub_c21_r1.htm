<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>You Are What You Eat</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Nothing created by man compares to the magnificent design of the human body. As you read this book, 2.5 million red blood cells are being made every second within your bone marrow in order to keep your body cells supplied with oxygen. Meanwhile, today you will produce ten quarts of digestive juices to break down the food you eat and enable it to pass through your “inside skin,” the gastrointestinal wall, a thirty-foot-long tract with a surface area of about twenty-two yards that effectively replaces itself every four days.</p>
<p class="indent">The health of your gastrointestinal tract is maintained by a team of some three hundred different strains of bacteria and other microorganisms, as unique to you as your fingerprint, which exceed the total number of cells in your entire body. Meanwhile, your immune system replaces its entire army every week and, when under viral attack, has the capacity to produce two hundred thousand new immune cells every minute. Even your outside skin is effectively replaced every month, while most of your body is renewed over a seven-year period. Your brain, a mere 3 lb. (1.4 kg) of mainly fat and water, is processing information of immense complexity through its trillion nerve cells, each connected to ten thousand others in a network whose connections are formed as our life, and the meaning we attach to it, unfolds. In fact, by the time you finish this chapter you will have hard-wired thirty new connections between your brain cells.</p>
<p class="indent">The energy produced from a small amount of food powers all these unseen processes, with plenty left over to keep us warm and allow us to undertake a wide range of physical activities. The by-products are water and carbon dioxide, both of which are essential for plants, which in turn produce carbohydrate, our fuel, and oxygen, the spark that lights our cellular fires. It is <a id="page181"/>estimated that we use only a quarter of a percent of our brain’s capacity and, in many cases, half the potential life span of our bodies. The design, the capacity, and the resilience of the human body is truly awesome.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, unlike a new car, we arrive without a maintenance manual and rely on instructions developed by those who have made their livelihood from a study of the human body—usually sick bodies at that. These instructions are in their infancy, a fact that is obvious when you consider how much of medicine is based on giving drugs that poison the body, radiation that burns it, and surgery that removes defective parts. Most of us begin to think about body maintenance only when something goes wrong. Yet, because of the body’s incredible resilience, most serious diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease take twenty to thirty years to develop. By the time we notice the symptoms, it may already be too late.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c21-s01"><strong>Learning from experience</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Once you realize that your body is a collection of highly organized cells, designed by the forces of nature, adapting to the changing environment over millions of years, it becomes natural to give that body what it needs, with the tangible benefit of health. Experience is, of course, the greatest motivator. If something you eat makes you feel good, you are likely to continue eating it, while if something makes you feel bad, you are likely to stop—unless you have become addicted. But in order to learn from experience, we must first understand something called the general adaptation syndrome. It was first described in 1956 by Professor Hans Selye, who proposed three basic stages of reaction to any event. This can be applied to a cigarette, a food, a stress, or a physical activity. Let’s see these stages, using your reaction to a stimulant such as caffeinated drinks or cigarettes as an example.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_039_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page182"/><em>The general adaptation syndrome</em>.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page183"/><strong>Stage</strong> 1: <strong>the initial response</strong>. Your first response to any event or substance is the best indicator of whether or not it suits you. Remember your first cigarette, your first alcoholic drink, or your first cup of coffee? You are unlikely to remember your first taste of sugar, meat, or milk or other foods introduced when you were very young.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Stage 2: adaptation</strong>. Very quickly your body learns to adapt. Gone is the pounding heart after a cup of coffee or coughing after a cigarette. An example of this stage is the rise and subsequent fall to normal levels of the blood pressure of country dwellers, not normally exposed to air pollution, who move to a city. The cells in the lungs of a smoker change form to protect themselves from smoke. Plaque develops in the arteries to repair damaged tissue. What is going on behind the scenes in all these cases? The body is trying to protect itself and in so doing is in an unseen state of stress.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Stage 3: exhaustion</strong>. Continue the insult for long enough and one day you are sick. Your energy is gone, your digestive system is not functioning properly, your blood pressure is raised, and you develop anything from chest infections to cancer. The body cannot cope; it cannot adapt any more. This is the stage at which most people seek help from a health practitioner.</p>
<p class="indent">We could add two further stages to this process.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Stage 4: recovery</strong>. To enable the body to recover, it is usually necessary to avoid or greatly restrict the initial insult and other undesirable substances. This means being as puritanical as possible for a period during which you may have to wean yourself off all sorts of things to which you have become addicted or allergic. Generally, these are the substances of which you would say, “I can give up anything but not my …” This is the nature of addiction. To help the body recover, much larger amounts of vitamins and minerals are needed than would normally be required just to maintain good health.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Stage 5: hypersensitivity</strong>. Once you have recovered and your body is basically healthy, which can take years, you are effectively back to stage one. But this time, because your diet and lifestyle are much improved, you may seem to be hypersensitive and react to all sorts of things that you never reacted to before: certain wines that contain additives, ordinary foods like wheat or milk, fumes, and so on. This is healthy because, just as in an initial reaction, your body is telling you what suits you. The more you follow this guidance, <a id="page184"/>the healthier you will become. In due course, as your reserve strength builds up, you can tolerate the odd insult without such hypersensitivity, but by then it is to be hoped that you will have learned (or suffered) enough not to indulge those old bad habits!</p>
<p class="indent">Once you understand this cycle and why it is that you can sometimes apparently abuse the body without noticeable ill effects, and at other times react strongly to small insults, it is easier to interpret what happens to you and alter your diet or lifestyle accordingly. Think about the substances that you have suspected may not suit you. What do they have in common? Perhaps there are subtle signs that you have chosen to ignore. Here is a list of the most common suspects that my clients have found they react to.</p>

<p class="indent">It is interesting that our ancestors, who until relatively recently in evolutionary terms were not cultivating grains or milking animals, were not exposed to any of these substances.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c21-s02"><strong>The delayed effect</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Another noteworthy phenomenon is the delayed effect. The general adaptation syndrome describes a long-term delayed effect, but with many foods there is a short-term delay of up to twenty-four hours before you notice their effect on you. For example, if you eat something very sweet, you may feel fine as your blood sugar level rises. But when it plummets four hours later, you may fall asleep. And alcohol has its worst effects many hours later. This is largely because, once the liver’s ability to detoxify alcohol is exceeded, the remaining alcohol is changed into a toxic by-product, which is what induces headaches and nausea. Many substances that are not good for you show an initial reaction within twenty-four hours.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c21-s03"><a id="page185"/><strong>A hairy bag of salty soup</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Scientists believe that we, like all other mammals, evolved from the sea. We carry our “sea” around inside us: we have many of the same constituents as the oceans from which we came. We are 66 percent water, 25 percent protein, and 8 percent fat, the rest being carbohydrate plus minerals and vitamins. Saddam Hussein, Tony Blair, Siegfried and Roy, you, and I are all just 66 percent water. “Hairy bags of salty soup,” said Dr. Michael Colgan, a British-born scientist who has pioneered the optimum nutrition approach. Yet if you were to throw all these compounds together, you would not end up with a human being. So what is it that makes life happen?</p>
<p class="indent">The answer, as explained in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c22_r1.htm">chapter 22</a>, is enzymes. They turn the food we eat into fuel for every single cell, be it a muscle cell, a brain cell, an immune cell, or a blood cell. Further enzymes within these cells turn the fuel into usable energy that makes our heart beat, our nerves fire, and all other bodily functions take place.</p>
<p class="indent">Everything in this universe is part of a vast ongoing chemical reaction. Our part, as temporary living organisms, is to provide ourselves and others with the best possible components to allow this process to continue in such a way that we all have a good, long, enjoyable life. And what makes our life-giving enzymes function at their peak? The answer is vitamins and minerals. Nearly all the thousands of enzymes in the body depend directly or indirectly on the presence of vitamins and minerals. Once you understand that the body and health itself depend on this vast and complex interacting network, you will appreciate that there is little point in taking extra quantities of a single vitamin. That would be like replacing only one dirty spark plug and expecting your car to run smoothly. Yet most medical research into nutrition has done just that, by taking one nutrient and measuring its effect on one aspect of health.</p>
<p class="indent">As you will see, the research that has produced the most astonishing results in improving energy, mental performance, longevity, fertility, and resistance to disease has involved a multinutrient approach that recognizes the fact that nutrients interact. <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p04_r1.htm">Parts 4</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p05_r1.htm">5</a> of this book explain the kinds of results that can be achieved and the conditions helped by applying the optimum nutrition approach.</p>
