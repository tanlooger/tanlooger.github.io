<h1 class="chapter2" id="c50"><a id="page438"/><strong>A to Z of Nutritional Healing</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">While there is no substitute for individual assessment of nutrient needs, the following nutritional advice is helpful for people suffering from particular health problems. For the more serious conditions, it is best to follow these programs under the supervision of your doctor or nutrition consultant. The supplements recommended are for adults and are based on the formulas given in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c47_r1.htm">chapter 47</a>. Since dosage is crucial, it is best to get supplements close to these formulas. When individual amounts of a nutrient are given, these are the total required. Check that you are not “doubling up” by receiving, for example, vitamin A in a multivitamin, an antioxidant, and a separate supplement.</p>
<p class="indent">For further guidance on supplement doses, stay within the ranges given in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c45_r1.htm">chapter 45</a>, using the higher amounts for conditions that are specifically helped by these nutrients, or when symptoms of deficiency are present.</p>
<p class="indent">All the recommendations given here are for adults. For guidance on supplemental levels for children, see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c40_r1.htm">chapter 40</a>. For babies and infants, I recommend you read my book <em>Optimum Nutrition Before, During and After Pregnancy</em>.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The recommendations given are aimed at helping to restore health in these conditions. They do not replace medical advice, nor should they be continued on an ongoing basis once the condition is corrected.</p>
<p class="indent">The basics for any supplement program, given on <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c47_r1.htm#page413">this page</a>, are 2 × a high-strength multivitamin and mineral (you can’t get optimum levels in only one pill), 1 gram or more of vitamin C, and an essential omega-3 and omega-6 supplement. You can get daily packs of these “basics,” which is a good place to start, adding any extras. The supplement directory in the Resources section gives some “best fit” products that meet the recommendations given below.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s01"><a id="page439"/><strong>Acne</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">This condition is most prevalent among teenagers, and the hormonal changes that take place at this age are certainly at the root of many skin problems. These changes cause the sebaceous glands to produce too much sebum and keratin, which block up the skin pores making them more likely to get infected. A diet high in saturated fat or fried food also makes pores more likely to get blocked. Vitamin A deficiency produces skin congestion through excessive keratinization of skin cells. Vitamin A and zinc deficiency leads to lowered ability to fight infection, as does lack of beneficial bacteria (through overuse of antibiotics). Optimum nutrition helps by balancing hormones as well as reducing the risk of infection. The most important nutrients are vitamins A, B complex (especially B<sub class="frac">6</sub>), C, and E, zinc, niacin for skin flushing, and vitamin E for wound healing. Good diet and cleanliness are essential. Be careful of supplements with added iodine, which can make acne worse.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s01-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow an optimum diet and drink plenty of water. Sulfur-rich foods such as eggs, onions, and garlic are also helpful. Avoid sugar, cigarettes, and fried and high-fat foods. Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (high-water-content foods).</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s01-s02"><em>Supplements</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>2 × multivitamin and multimineral</li>
<li>2 × antioxidant complex</li>
<li>2 × vitamin C 1,000 mg</li>
<li>Niacin (B<sub class="frac">3</sub>) 100 mg for thirty days (for flushing and cleansing the skin)</li>
<li>Zinc 15 mg</li>
<li>Vitamin E 600 IU (helps heal the skin)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Use topical vitamin A cream (see Resources). Also read <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c27_r1.htm">chapter 27</a>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s02"><strong>Alcoholism</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Particularly prevalent among histadelic (high-histamine) people (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c38_r1.htm#page337">this page</a>), alcoholism may in part be a way of coping with the excess energy that such individuals produce. B vitamins, especially B<sub class="frac">l</sub>, B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, are <a id="page440"/>destroyed by alcohol, which primarily affects the liver and nervous system. Vitamins A and C help protect the liver. Glutamine heals the gut and reduces cravings. A very alkaline diet reduces the craving for alcohol. Tyrosine and adaptogens help prevent emotional and physicals lows after stopping. Emotional problems almost always underlie alcoholism, and these, as well as the addiction—which usually also exists for sugar—must be addressed.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s02-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the recommended diet and eat plenty of whole grains, beans, and lentils. Drink plenty of water. Often, sugar addiction is substituted for dependency on alcohol, which is just another form of sugar, so sugar and stimulants are also best avoided. Eat frequent meals containing some protein foods such as nuts, seeds, fish, chicken, eggs, or milk products.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s02-s02"><em>Supplements</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>3 × multivitamin and multimineral</li>
<li>2 × antioxidant complex</li>
<li>3 × vitamin C 1,000 mg</li>
<li>Adaptogen herbs, plus tyrosine</li>
<li>Bone mineral complex (providing 500 mg calcium and 300 mg magnesium)</li>
<li>Glutamine powder 5 g twice a day in water on an empty stomach</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Also read <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c35_r1.htm">chapters 35</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c38_r1.htm">38</a>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s03"><strong>Allergies</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">“Allergy” is a word that often invokes connotations beyond its original meaning. An allergy is an intolerance to a particular substance. We have an intolerance to coffee, for example, if large amounts produce symptoms. Some people have more pronounced symptoms, even in reaction to simple foods like wheat or milk. Since an allergy is like an addiction, it is often the foods that one is most “addicted” to that are suspect. If you feel that you might have allergies but do not know what they are, it is best to see a nutrition consultant or an allergy specialist who can test you and solve any underlying digestive imbalances that provoke allergies. Optimum nutrition will greatly reduce or clear up allergic reactions in most cases. Vitamin C, calcium, and <a id="page441"/>magnesium help reduce the severity of allergic reactions. L-glutamine heals the gut and supports the immune system, reducing allergic potential.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s03-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow a general healthy diet. Avoid suspect foods, dairy products, and grains (the most common allergens), especially wheat. After two months you may be able to reintroduce suspect foods every fourth day without having a reaction. Eventually, you may be able to tolerate your allergens in small amounts on a daily basis.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s04"><strong>Alzheimer’s and dementia</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Like many degenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s stems primarily from not looking after your diet and lifestyle. The actual damage in the brain is caused by inflammation linked to too many oxidants, blood sugar problems, raised Cortisol, high homocysteine, and exposure to toxic metals. These include aluminum, copper, and mercury. Trace amounts of mercury can cause the type of damage to nerves that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s. If you are experiencing significant decline in mental function and have a mouth full of amalgam fillings, I’d recommend you seriously consider having them replaced. One of the best predictors of dementia and Alzheimer’s risk is your blood level of homocysteine. If it’s high, supplementing large amounts of B<sub class="frac">6</sub> (100 mg), B<sub class="frac">12</sub> (100 mcg), and folic acid (800 mcg) helps lower it.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s04-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (aim for a mix of all colors, combining blueberries, beets, carrots, yellow peppers, and green vegetables), seeds, <a id="page442"/>and fish such as mackerel, salmon, or tuna, rich in omega-3 and vitamin E. Eat whole foods, and avoid refined foods and sugar, smoking, alcohol, and fried foods.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s04-s02"><em>Supplements</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>2 × multivitamin and mineral</li>
<li>3 × antioxidant complex</li>
<li>4 × vitamin C 1,000 mg</li>
<li>3 × brain-food formula</li>
<li>3 × omega-3 fish oils</li>
<li>Homocysteine-lowering formula, if your homocysteine score is high</li>
<li>Lecithin granules (1 tablespoon)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Also read <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c28_r1.htm">chapters 28</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c42_r1.htm">42</a>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s05"><strong>Anemia</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Anemia can be caused by iron, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, or folic acid deficiency. A blood test can determine if you have such deficiencies. Iron is needed in the body to make hemoglobin—a key part of blood responsible for the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to your tissues, brain, muscles, and organs. If you’re low in iron, you can’t make enough red blood cells, hence your pale appearance, and with fewer red blood cells, your brain and body don’t get the levels of oxygen and other nutrients they need. If you’re low in folic acid or B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, the hemoglobin is misshapen and doesn’t work properly. The result? Tiredness.</p>
<p class="indent">Two simple tests of your iron status involve your eyelids and fingernails. Look in the area under your lower eyelids—it should be a rich pink/red color, not pale; press on the end of your fingernail, turning the bed white—it should come back to red quickly when you release it, not stay pale.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s05-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Red meat is well known as a good source of iron, but can also be rich in saturated fat. Sources that do not have a high fat content include eggs, spinach and other greens, beans, lentils, prunes, dried apricots, molasses, and pumpkin seeds, so eat plenty of these, as well as green vegetables and beans, which are rich in folate. Only foods of animal origin contain vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub>.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s05-s02"><a id="page443"/><em>Supplements</em></h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>2 × multivitamin and mineral</li>
<li>Amino acid–chelated iron 10 mg</li>
<li>2 × vitamin C 1,000 mg</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s06"><strong>Angina and atherosclerosis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Atherosclerosis is a narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits. When the condition becomes more pronounced, blood pressure begins to increase. If a pronounced block occurs in the arteries that supply the heart with oxygen, then angina, experienced as chest pain on exertion, may result. Optimum nutrition is the primary method for preventing both of these conditions. Antioxidant nutrients help prevent the cellular damage that may underlie these problems. Vitamin C and lysine help reverse atherosclerosis. Vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> (niacin) raises HDL, the cholesterol remover. Fish oils, rich in EPA and DHA, thin the blood and reduce cholesterol.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s06-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the dietary advice in this book strictly, avoiding sugar, salt, foods high in saturated fat, coffee, and excess alcohol. Ensure there are sufficient essential fats in the diet by eating seeds. Take plenty of exercise within your capacity.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s07"><a id="page444"/><strong>Arthritis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are two major forms of arthritis and many different causes of both. Osteoarthritis, more common in the elderly, describes a condition in which the cartilage in the joints wears away, inducing pain and stiffness mainly in weight-bearing joints. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the whole body, not just certain joints. Antioxidant nutrients, essential fats, and herbs such as boswellia, curcumin, and certain hop extracts reduce inflammation. B vitamins and vitamin C support the endocrine system, which controls calcium balance. Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and boron support bone health. Glucosamine and MSM help build healthy joints.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s07-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the optimum diet in this book and be sure to avoid adrenal stimulants such as tea, coffee, sugar, and refined carbohydrates. Drink plenty of water and herb teas. Check for allergies, and have a hair mineral analysis done to check your mineral levels.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s08"><strong>Asthma</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">This inflammatory condition affects the lungs and respiration and is characterized by difficulty in breathing and frequent coughing. Often attacks are brought on by underlying allergies, stressful events, or changes in environmental conditions like the weather. Vitamin A helps protect the lining of the lungs, while vitamin C helps deal with environmental toxins. Antioxidant nutrients and essential fats are anti-inflammatory.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s08-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s09"><strong>Breast cancer</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Most breast cancers are hormonally related, linked to estrogen dominance and progesterone deficiency. Stress, excessive use of stimulants, and exposure to pesticides all disrupt hormone balance. Some forms of breast cancer, however, are linked more to carcinogens. Antioxidant nutrients have been shown to decrease risk and increase survival. Use of natural progesterone has been shown to reverse the proliferation of tumor cells. See your doctor or a nutrition consultant to get your hormone levels tested and consider natural progesterone cream.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s09-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the diet in this book, with an emphasis on foods high in antioxidants, avoiding milk and meat, beef in particular, because of their IGF hormone content, and eating organic as much as possible. Have plenty of phytoestrogen-rich foods—beans, lentils, seeds, and nuts—and lots of fresh organic fruit and vegetables. Keep saturated fat very low and ensure you have adequate essential fats from seeds and their cold-pressed oils.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s10"><strong>Bronchitis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In this condition, the tissues of the lung get inflamed. Optimum nutrition can help prevent it by strengthening the immune system and helping to maintain healthy lung tissue. Vitamins A, B complex, C, and E and the minerals <a id="page446"/>selenium and zinc all strengthen the immune system. Vitamins A and C protect lung tissue.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s10-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the diet in this book and do not smoke. You may also find some relief from following a diet low in mucus-forming foods, such as milk and milk products. Keep saturated fat very low and ensure you have adequate essential fats from seeds and their cold-pressed oils.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s11"><strong>Burns, cuts, and bruises</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">All these conditions require skin to heal, which depends on a good supply of vitamins A, C, and E and zinc and bioflavonoids. These reduce bruising, speed up healing, and minimize scar tissue. Vitamin E oil can be rubbed around, but not on, cuts and burns; you can get it by piercing a vitamin E capsule. Also useful are creams rich in vitamin A, C, or E in a form that can penetrate the skin, such as retinyl, ascorbyl, or locopheryl palmitate.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c50-s12"><a id="page447"/><strong>Cancer</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are many different kinds of cancer, with different causes. Most cancers are associated with exposure to or ingestion of cancer-causing agents, coupled with immune insufficiency Often there is an association with free radical damage of cells, which then become cancerous. Depending on the type of cancer, the first step is to eliminate cancer-stimulating agents such as smoking, a high-fat diet, HRT, excessive exposure to sunlight or pesticides, a high-meat diet, alcohol, and so on. The next step is to build up the strength of the immune system with diet and supplements and to increase your intake of antioxidant nutrients.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s12-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Stick strictly to the diet advice in this book. Increase the amount of high-antioxidant foods you eat (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c15_r1.htm#page134">this page</a>). Cut out red meat and alcohol and reduce your intake of all sources of saturated fat. A vegan-type diet is best. Also, drink plenty of water and herb tea, especially cat’s claw, which is a potent immune booster.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s13"><strong>Candidiasis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The overgrowth of <em>Candida albicans</em>, a yeastlike fungus, can occur anywhere in the body, most commonly in the digestive tract or the vagina, and causes thrush or yeast infection. Mild overgrowth can be eliminated by a four-point plan: antifungal agents such as caprylic acid and grapefruit seed extract; supplementation of beneficial bacteria; an immune-boosting diet and supplements; and an “anticandida” diet (see below). It is usually best to work with a nutrition consultant, who can confirm the extent of the infection with proper tests.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s13-s01"><a id="page448"/><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Avoid all sources of sugar and especially fast-releasing sugars (including fruit for the first month). Also stay away from yeast-containing foods, mushrooms, and fermented foods such as alcohol and vinegar. Intake of wheat is often best reduced since it irritates the gut. This means living off vegetables, grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. It is worth getting a good anticandida recipe book!</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s14"><strong>Chronic fatigue</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are many causes of chronic fatigue, the most common of which is suboptimum nutrition. Nutrients needed in energy production include vitamins C and B complex, iron, and magnesium. However, more pronounced symptoms, sometimes called ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis), can include extreme tiredness on exertion. These can result from the body’s ability to detoxify being overloaded. Any generation of energy (exercise) or digestion (eating) produces toxins for the body to deal with. If symptoms occur after eating or exercise, see a nutrition consultant who can test your liver detoxification potential.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s14-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Eat little and often, choosing from slow-releasing carbohydrates and snacking on fruit. Avoid sugar and stimulants such as tea, coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. In general, follow the dietary recommendations in this book.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s15"><strong>Colds and flu</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Exposure to viruses is unavoidable, unless you live like a hermit. However, whether you succumb to a virus depends on the strength of your immune system at the time of infection. Studies have repeatedly shown that taking a daily supplement of 1 gram of vitamin C or more reduces the incidence, severity, and duration of colds. However, optimum nutrition, together with immune-boosting nutrients during cold epidemics, can produce even better results.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s15-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Avoid all dairy products, eggs, and excessive meat or soy consumption, since these foods are mucus forming.

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s16"><strong>Colitis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In this condition, part of the large intestine is inflamed. It is often stress induced; however, it can also be due to poor diet, poor elimination, an allergy, or suboptimum nutrition. Since there is inflammation, the first step is to <a id="page450"/>reduce any aggravating foods including alcohol, coffee, and wheat. These can be replaced by foods and drinks that pass easily through the digestive tract, such as steamed vegetables, rice, fish, and fruit, plus digestive enzyme supplements. Essential fats rich in GLA are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. Antioxidants also help reduce inflammation.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s16-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">While the diet recommended in this book is a good one, the high fiber content can act as an irritant in this condition. So a diet of lightly steamed vegetables, fish, and cooked grains is often preferable, with easy-to-digest fruit as snacks. Avoid all digestive irritants, which can include any food you are allergic to, wheat, alcohol, coffee, and spices.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s17"><strong>Constipation</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Contrary to popular belief, we should empty our bowels not once but two or three times a day. A healthy stool should break up easily and be no strain to pass. By these criteria, a large majority of people suffer from constipation. A high-fiber diet will help, as will a reduction in meat and milk products. Exercise is crucial, as it strengthens the abdominal muscles. Vitamins B<sub class="frac">1</sub> and E help, while vitamin C may loosen the bowels. A nonirritant laxative, fructo-oligosaccharides powder, helps relieve severe constipation.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s17-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the diet advice in this book, in particular eating high-fiber foods. Drink at least 1¾ pints of water a day, preferably between meals. Reduce your consumption of meat and milk products. Include oats and prunes in your diet, as well as flaxseeds, which can be ground and sprinkled on food.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s18"><strong>Crohn’s disease</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disorder that responds very well to nutritional therapy. A few factors should be considered. Sensitivity to certain foods, most commonly gluten (the protein found in wheat, oats, rye, and barley) and milk, can aggravate Crohn’s, so avoiding them can help. The amount of good bacteria in the gut is likely to be low, so restore the balance with a probiotic supplement such as <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>. Taking some omega-3-rich fish or flax oil helps calm the inflammation. Certain herbs such as slippery elm or marshmallow are very soothing to the gut lining, while others such as boswellia and curcumin can reduce inflammation. The amino acid glutamine, 5 to 10 grams taken as a powder in water last thing at night, also helps repair the gut.</p>
<p class="indent">Most people with Crohn’s are allergic to certain foods, most commonly gluten, and also have raised homocysteine levels. It is well worth working with a nutritional therapist, who can test for these factors and help you find your perfect diet and supplement program.</p>
<p class="indent">You can’t avoid fiber completely and wouldn’t want to. Fiber is a natural constituent of a healthy diet high in fruit, vegetables, lentils, beans, and whole grains, and by eating such a diet you have less risk of bowel cancer, diabetes, or diverticular disease and are unlikely to suffer from constipation. However, be really careful with insoluble fiber found in bran and whole grains. It’s harsh on the bowel and doesn’t suit a sensitive or inflamed digestive system. There are, however, many different kinds of fiber. Soluble fibers, found in oats, lentils, beans, fruit, vegetables, and flaxseeds (which you should continue to eat plenty of), are another story. Foods rich in soluble fiber contain many other nutrients as well, so are an important part of any healthy diet, including the diets of Crohn’s sufferers.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s18-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Avoid coffee, alcohol, and sugar, drink 1.5 quarts of water daily, and eat fresh whole foods that are naturally high in soluble fiber, such as lentils, beans, <a id="page452"/>ground seeds, fruit, and lightly cooked vegetables. Have ground flaxseeds or soaked flaxseeds.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s20"><strong>Depression</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">There are many nutritionally related causes of depression, the most common being suboptimum nutrition resulting in poor mental and physical energy. Disturbed blood sugar balance can result in periods of depression. Lack of omega-3 fats can make you depressed. If you are low in serotonin, you may benefit from 5-HTP. People who produce excessive amounts of histamine are also prone to depression. Adrenal exhaustion, usually brought on by stress and overuse of stimulants, can result in it. Allergies too can bring on depression. A nutrition consultant can help identify any factor that can be corrected by nutrition.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s21"><strong>Dermatitis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">This condition literally means “skin inflammation” and is similar to eczema. Usually the term “dermatitis” is used when the primary cause appears to be a contact allergy. Go through all possibilities such as metals in jewelry and watches, perfumes, cosmetics, detergents, soaps, and shampoos. Where there is a contact allergy there is often a food allergy too: common culprits are dairy products and wheat. Sometimes a combination of eating an allergy-provoking food and contact with an external allergen is needed in order for symptoms to develop. Another frequently encountered factor is a lack of essential fatty acids from seeds and their oils, which in the body turn into anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. Their formation is also blocked by too much saturated fat or fried food or a lack of certain key vitamins and minerals. The skin is also a route that the body can use to get rid of toxins. A certain kind of dermatitis, called acrodermatitis, responds exceptionally well to zinc supplementation and is primarily caused by zinc deficiency.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s21-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Generally a vegan-type diet, low in saturated fat but with enough essential fats from seeds, is best. If you suspect an allergy to dairy products or wheat, test for this by avoiding these foods.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s22"><strong>Diabetes</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Both child-onset diabetes and adult-onset diabetes are conditions caused by too high blood sugar. Child-onset diabetes is thought to develop through a cross-reaction between a protein in milk and beef and a protein in the pancreas. This can occur if genetically susceptible infants are fed dairy products or beef in their first few months, before their digestive tract and immune system are fully matured. Adult-onset diabetes is usually a consequence of poor eating habits (too much sugar and stimulants), often preceded by hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. Ensuring that adrenal hormones, insulin, and glucose tolerance factor are properly produced by the liver is fundamental in dealing with all forms of glucose intolerance and diabetes. Particularly important are vitamins C, B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, B<sub class="frac">5</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">6</sub> and zinc and chromium. It is best to discuss any proposed changes in your diet with your doctor.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s22-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The key to a diabetic diet is to keep your blood sugar level even. This is achieved best by eating little and often, choosing foods that contain slow-releasing carbohydrates plus some protein. This means eating some nuts with fruit, “seed” vegetables like corn, peas, green beans, or whole grains, beans, or lentils, which contain both slow-releasing carbohydrate and protein. Avoid all sugar and forms of concentrated sweetness, such as concentrated fruit juice, and even excesses of faster-releasing fruit such as dates and bananas or of dried fruit. Also avoid too many adrenal stimulants such as tea, coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and salt.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This is a condition of the small and large intestine, in which pockets in the intestinal wall become distended and are then more likely to get infected and inflamed. The condition, probably the result of not enough fiber and exercise, is rarely seen in primitive cultures. A general vitamin program is recommended to support the muscle tone surrounding the intestines and to maintain a strong infection-fighting system. Increased soluble fiber and regular exercise such as swimming are the key treatments.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s23-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the recommended diet in this book, with particular reference to the high-fiber foods (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p09_r1.htm">part 9</a>). However, if the inflammation is severe, it is best to eat lightly steamed vegetables, oats (which contain soluble fiber), and ground seeds or nuts and to stay away from added “hard” fibers like wheat bran. It is best to soak grain like oats so as to maximize their water content; these foods provide fiber without irritating the inflamed area. Also have a cold-pressed oil blend rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, as these help calm down inflammation.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s24"><strong>Ear infections</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Infections of this kind are most frequently the result of an underlying allergy. An allergic reaction induces inflammation that blocks the thin tube that runs from the sinuses to the ears. Once this swells and blocks, the inner ear chamber becomes a favorite site for infection. Treatment with antibiotics quadruples the risk of another infection. This may be because antibiotics irritate the gut wall, making it more leaky, which exacerbates underlying allergies.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s24-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the diet recommended in this book. Eat and drink plenty of fruit, vegetables, and their juices. Drink plenty of water, herb teas, and three cups of cat’s claw tea a day.

<p class="nonindent">These are accumulations of calcium or cholesterol in the duct running from the liver to the gallbladder, which stores bile used for digesting fats. If this duct is blocked, fats cannot be properly absorbed and jaundice occurs. It is not excesses of calcium or cholesterol in the diet that are to blame, but rather how these substances are dealt with in the body. Often, gallstone victims have inherited very narrow bile ducts, increasing their risk of this condition. Lecithin helps to emulsify cholesterol, and optimum nutrition in general should help prevent such abnormalities occurring. Digestive enzyme supplements contain lipase to help digest fat.</p>

<p class="nonindent">There are many different kinds of hair problems, from dry or oily hair to premature hair loss, but most are linked to what you eat. Oily hair can occur <a id="page459"/>with vitamin B deficiency. Dry or brittle hair is often a sign of essential fat deficiency. Poor hair growth, or loss of color, is a sign of zinc deficiency. Hair loss is connected with general nutritional deficiency, especially a lack of iron, vitamin B<sub class="frac">1</sub>, vitamin C, or lysine (an amino acid). Some hair supplements contain all these. Massaging the scalp also helps, as does hanging upside down, including doing headstands and “inversion” poses in yoga, which improve circulation to the scalp. The combination of optimum nutrition, stimulating scalp circulation, and correcting underlying hormonal imbalances (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c25_r1.htm">chapter 25</a>) has proved the most effective answer for hair loss.

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s31"><strong>Hay fever</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Even though allergic reactions to pollen are the identified cause of hay fever, other factors make one person more likely to sneeze than another. The incidence of hay fever has risen dramatically in cities compared with rural areas, which led to the discovery that pollutants such as exhaust fumes prime the immune system to react. During the summer, the air in polluted areas contains more free radicals due to the action of sunlight on oxygen molecules, so city dwellers breathe in more pollutants. Taking a good all-round antioxidant supplement containing vitamins A, C, and E, beta-carotene, selenium, and zinc, plus the amino acids cysteine or glutathione, helps increase your resistance (the most effective forms of these amino acids are N-acetyl cysteine, sometimes called NAC, and “reduced” glutathione). The amino acid methionine, in combination with calcium, is an effective antihistamine. You need to take 500 mg of L-methionine with 400 mg of calcium twice a day. Vitamin C helps control excessive histamine levels. vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub> and zinc have a role to play in balancing histamine levels and strengthening the immune system. vitamin B<sub class="frac">5</sub> helps reduce symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">The three most common substances reacted to are pollen, wheat, and milk. Although there is no proven connection, it is interesting to note that all these are originally grass products. It may be that some hay fever sufferers become sensitized to proteins that are common to grains, grasses, and possibly milk. In any event, dairy products encourage mucus production. Similarly, modern strains of wheat are high in gluten, which irritates the digestive tract and stimulates mucus production.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s31-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>

<p class="nonindent">There are many causes of headaches and migraines, ranging from blood sugar drops, dehydration, and allergy, to stress and tension, or a critical combination. Peaks and troughs in adrenaline and blood sugar can bring on a headache. Often headaches go away with optimum nutrition. If they persist, look carefully at the possibility of allergy. See if you can notice any correlation between the foods you eat and the incidence of headaches.</p>
<p class="indent">For migraine sufferers, instead of taking an aspirin or migraine drugs that constrict the blood vessels, try taking 100 to 200 mg of vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> in the niacin form, which is a vasodilator. Start with the smaller dose: this will often stop or reduce a migraine in the early stages.

I recommend supplementing 1,000 mg of lysine every day, away from food, to keep the virus at bay. When you have an active infection, supplement 3,000 mg of lysine a day and cut back on foods rich in arginine, which include beans, lentils, nuts, and chocolate. The more stressed you are, the weaker your immune system becomes and the more chances the virus has to become active. A good way to boost your immune system is to supplement 2,000 mg of vitamin C every day. Some people also find MSM reduces an infection. It’s worth trying if lysine doesn’t clear things up.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Hypertension or high blood pressure can be caused by atherosclerosis (a narrowing and thickening of the arteries), arterial tension, or thicker blood. Arterial tension is controlled by the balance of calcium, magnesium, and potassium in relation to sodium (salt). Stress also plays a part. Correcting this balance can lower blood pressure in thirty days. Vitamins C and E and fish oils high in EPA and DHA help keep the blood thin.

<p class="nonindent">The main focus of current research is on antioxidant nutrients that strengthen the immune system. Leading researcher Dr. Raxit Jariwalla from the Linus Pauling Institute in California has shown vitamin C’s ability to suppress the HIV virus in laboratory cultures of infected cells. He found that with continuous exposure to ascorbic acid (vitamin C), in concentrations not harmful to cells, the growth of HIV in immune cells could be reduced by 99.5 percent. Dr. Jariwalla suggests that in healthy humans a daily dose of at least 10 g is needed for an antiviral effect. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an altered form of the amino acid cysteine that is a powerful antioxidant, has also been found to have antiviral properties. Dr. Jariwalla discovered that adding vitamin C to NAC created an eightfold increase in anti-HIV activity.</p>

<p class="nonindent">This unpleasant state can be caused by many different factors, including too much or too little hydrochloric acid production in the stomach. Excessive stomach acid or a hiatal hernia usually causes heartburn. Insufficient hydrochloric acid or digestive-enzyme deficiency usually causes a feeling of indigestion and reduced well-being after a meal. A bacterial imbalance or fungal infection in the gut can also result in these symptoms, plus bloating after a meal, because undesirable organisms multiply on feeding.

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s40"><strong>Inflammation</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Many health problems, including all those ending in “itis,” are inflammatory. This means that a part of the body such as a muscle or joint, the gut, or the respiratory tract, is inflamed. This is a sign that the body is reacting, or overreacting, to something. A tendency to overreact can arise if a person is deficient in essential fats and their supportive nutrients, vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub> and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, biotin, vitamin C, zinc, and magnesium. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B<sub class="frac">5</sub>) is also needed to make Cortisol, the body’s anti-inflammatory hormone. Boswellic acid, found in the plant frankincense, is a natural anti-inflammatory agent that is available in the form of a cream for inflamed joints and muscles. L-glutamine helps to calm gut inflammation. Antioxidant nutrients are also intimately involved in inflammatory responses. However, there is little point in calming down an inflammation if the source of irritation remains. This may be a food allergy or an irritating substance such as alcohol.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s40-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Avoid immune-suppressing or potentially irritating substances such as coffee, alcohol, and strong spices. Avoid suspect foods such as wheat and dairy products for ten days to gauge your reaction to them. Otherwise, just follow the diet guidelines in this book.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s42"><strong>Kidney stones</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Kidney stones are abnormal accumulations of mineral salts found in the kidneys, bladder, or anywhere along the urinary tract and can range in size from a grain of sand to a fingertip. There are various kinds, but 80 percent of kidney stones are calcium oxalate stones. Excessive calcium in too-alkaline urine crystallizes and stones begin to form.</p>
<p class="indent">By far, the most important thing to do to prevent kidney stones is to drink plenty of filtered or bottled water—at least two quarts a day—to flush the kidneys and urinary tract regularly. Nutrient deficiencies can also contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially lack of magnesium, <a id="page468"/>vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, vitamin D, and potassium, all of which are involved in proper calcium metabolism.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s42-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Green leafy vegetables, whole grains, bananas, nuts, and seeds should be consumed regularly. Vitamin A, abundant in carrots, red peppers, sweet potatoes, and green leafy vegetables, also benefits the urinary tract and helps inhibit the formation of stones. Avoid antacids and minimize your consumption of animal protein, as they cause the body to excrete calcium and uric acid, the key components in the two most common forms of kidney stones.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Cramps are most commonly due to calcium-magnesium imbalances and are corrected by supplementing 500 mg of calcium and 300 mg of magnesium. Despite popular belief, the condition is very rarely due to a lack of salt. In fact, it is best to avoid added salt and to keep fluid intake high. Fruit is naturally rich in potassium and water and contains sufficient sodium for the body’s needs. Muscle aches can occur for the same reason or when muscle cells are not able to make energy efficiently from glucose. Magnesium, particularly in the form of magnesium malate, helps here too, as do B vitamins. Aches can also occur as a result of inflammation (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c26_r1.htm#page228">this page</a>).</p>

<p class="nonindent">As well as eating no more than you need, choosing foods that keep the blood sugar even, backed up by an optimal intake of nutrients that help stabilize blood sugar, will help you lose weight by stabilizing your appetite and burning fat. These nutrients include vitamins B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, and C and zinc and chromium. Konjac fiber, a source of glucomannan, also helps to stabilize blood sugar levels. Also helpful is HCA, which slows down the ability of the body to turn excess fuel into body fat, and 5-HTP, which stabilizes appetite. <a id="page470"/>In some people, food allergies cause water retention that can contribute to obesity. If you suspect any foods, the most common being wheat and dairy products, eliminate them for ten days to test whether they are associated with your weight gain. Thyroid problems can also be a factor in obesity. If all else fails, ask your doctor to check your thyroid.</p>

<p class="nonindent">In this condition, the density of the bones decreases, increasing the risk of fracture and compression of the spinal vertebrae. From a nutritional perspective, there are three main contributors. These are excessive protein consumption, leading to leaching of calcium from the bone to neutralize excess blood acidity; relative dominance of estrogen to progesterone, the latter being a major trigger for bone growth; and deficiency of bone-building nutrients, which include calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, silica, phosphorus, and boron.

<p class="nonindent">Premenstrual syndrome describes the occurrence of a cluster of symptoms including bloating, tiredness, irritability, depression, breast tenderness, and headaches, occurring most commonly in the week leading up to menstruation. There are three main causes: estrogen dominance and relative progesterone deficiency—corrected by natural progesterone and avoiding sources of estrogen; glucose intolerance, marked by a craving for sweet foods and stimulants; and deficiency in essential fatty acids and vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, zinc, and magnesium, which together create prostaglandins, which help balance hormone levels. While the need for these is greatest just before a period is due, it is wise to take the supplements throughout the month. If dietary and supplementary intervention does not result in significant improvement, consider seeing a nutrition consultant and having your hormone balance checked.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s51"><a id="page474"/><strong>Sinusitis</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">An inflammation of the sinus and nasal passages, sinusitis often leads to sinus infections. Contributory factors are nasal irritants such as exhaust fumes, cigarettes, smoky places, dust, and pollen; allergies, often to dairy products and wheat, which are mucus forming; plus a weakened immune system. Too much alcohol, fried food, or stress; lack of sleep; and overeating all weaken the immune system. Vitamins A and C and zinc, among other nutrients, help boost immunity. Essential fats are also needed to control inflammation.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s51-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Eat lightly, but do eat—lots of essential foods such as the best organic fruit and vegetables (baby vegetables, just sprouted), plus seeds. You do need protein (from quinoa, seeds, nuts, fish, tofu, and so on) but avoid mucus-forming foods such as milk, eggs, and meat.</p>
<p class="indent">Also inhale tea tree oil or Olbas Oil, in the bath or by holding it under your nose (be careful not to irritate the skin too much) to stop your nasal passages from blocking. Tiger balm is good on the chest. Drink homemade ginger and cinnamon tea (five slices of fresh ginger root and one stick of cinnamon in a thermos with 1 cup of boiling water) or cat’s claw tea to boost the immune system.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s52"><strong>Sleeping problems</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">For some sufferers, the major problem of insomnia is waking up in the middle of the night; for others it is not getting to sleep in the first place. Both can be the effect on the nervous system of poor nutrition or too much stress and anxiety. Calcium and magnesium have a tranquilizing effect, as does vitamin <a id="page475"/>B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. Tryptophan, a constituent of protein, has the strongest tranquilizing effect and, if taken in doses of 1,000 to 3,000 mg, it is highly effective for insomnia. It takes about an hour to work and remains effective for up to four hours. While tryptophan is nonaddictive and has no known side effects, its regular use in not recommended—it is better to adjust your lifestyle so that no tranquilizing agents are needed.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s53"><strong>Thyroid problems</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The thyroid gland, situated at the base of the throat, controls our rate of metabolism. In hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid, symptoms such as overactivity, loss of weight, and nervousness are common; in hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid, the symptoms are lack of energy, becoming overweight, and goiter, in which the throat region swells. Overstimulation of the endocrine system through living off stress and stimulants and estrogen dominance are common causes of an underactive thyroid later in life. This can also be caused by a lack of iodine, although this is rare, and taking iodine in kelp is advised to help the condition. Since the thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary and adrenal glands, the nutrients involved in hormone production and regulation for all three glands are particularly important. These are vitamins C and B complex (especially B<sub class="frac">3</sub> and B<sub class="frac">5</sub>), manganese, and zinc. Selenium also appears to have a role to play in thyroid health, as does the amino acid tyrosine from which thyroxine is made. Often, a low dose of thyroxine is required to correct this condition.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s54"><strong>Ulcers</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">These can occur in the stomach and duodenum—the first section of the small intestine, which is not as well protected as the rest of the intestines against the acid secretions of the stomach. In prolonged stress, the stomach can over-secrete acid, so stress can be a cause. Also, diets that are too acid forming are to be avoided. Vitamin A is the primary nutrient needed to protect the lining of the duodenum. While vitamin C does help people with duodenal ulcers, not more than 500 mg should be taken as it can cause irritation. If a burning sensation is experienced after taking vitamin C, the dose is too high. The most common cause of ulcers is infection with <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>. This should be tested for by your doctor and treated with a specific antibacterial agent. Also, check for food allergies.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c50-s55"><a id="page477"/><strong>Varicose veins</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Veins carry blood returning to the heart. A varicose vein is one that has become enlarged and swollen; the condition usually occurs in the legs, where circulation is most difficult. It is unlikely that optimum nutrition can do much for veins that are already varicose; however, adequate vitamins C and E as well as other antioxidants can help prevent further occurrences. Also, there is some evidence that a high-fiber diet can help prevent varicose veins.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c50-s55-s01"><em>Diet advice</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Follow the diet recommended in this book. Regular exercise, especially swimming, will improve the circulation. Putting your feet up and gentle leg massages are all helpful. Application of vitamin E cream is beneficial.</p>
