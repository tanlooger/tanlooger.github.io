<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Secrets for a Healthy Heart</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">You have a 50 percent chance of dying from heart or artery disease. That is the bad news. The good news is that heart disease is, in most cases, completely preventable. Yet so widespread is this epidemic that we almost take it for granted. We fail to protect ourselves from a disease more life threatening than AIDS, a condition whose cause for the most part is known and whose cure is already proven.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing natural about dying from heart disease. Many cultures do not experience a high incidence of strokes or heart attacks. By contrast, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women, with a quarter of a million Americans dying of heart disease in 2001. Autopsies performed on the mummified remains of Egyptians who died around 3000 <span class="small">B.C</span>. showed signs of deposits in the arteries but no actual blockages that would result in strokes or heart attacks.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the obvious signs (severe chest pain, cold sweats, nausea, fall in blood pressure, and weak pulse), in the 1930s a heart attack was so rare that it took a specialist to make the diagnosis. According to American health records, the incidence of heart attacks per one hundred thousand people was none in 1890 and had risen to 340 by 1970. Although deaths did occur from other forms of heart disease, including calcified valves, rheumatic heart, and other congenital defects, the incidence of actual blockages in the arteries causing a stroke or heart attack used to be minimal.</p>
<p class="indent">Even more worrying is the fact that heart disease is occurring earlier and earlier. Autopsies performed in Vietnam showed that one in two soldiers killed in action, with an average age of twenty-two, already had arterial blockages (atherosclerosis). Nowadays, most teenagers can be expected to show signs <a id="page195"/>of atherosclerosis, heralding the beginning of heart disease. Obviously, something about our lifestyle, diet, or environment has changed radically in the last sixty years to bring on this modern epidemic.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_042_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>The respiratory and cardiovascular system</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s01"><a id="page196"/><strong>What is heart disease?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The cardiovascular system consists of blood vessels that carry oxygen, fuel (glucose), building materials (amino acids), vitamins, and minerals to every single cell in your body. The blood is oxygenated when tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, absorb oxygen from the lungs and in turn discharge carbon dioxide, which we then exhale. These blood vessels feed into the heart, which pumps the oxygenated blood to all cells. At the cells, the blood vessels once more become a network of extremely thin capillaries, which give off oxygen plus other nutrients and in return receive waste products. Oxygen plus glucose is needed to make energy within every cell of the body; the waste products are carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p class="indent">The blood vessels that supply cells with nutrients and oxygen are called arteries, while the blood vessels that carry away waste products and carbon dioxide are called veins. Arterial blood is a brighter red than venous blood because oxygen is carried on a complex called hemoglobin, which contains iron. The pressure in the arteries is also greater than in the veins. As well as returning to the heart after it has visited the cells, all blood passes through the kidneys. Here, waste products are removed and formed into urine that is stored in the bladder.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c23-s01-s01"><em>Diseases of the arteries</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Heart disease is wrongly named. The main life-threatening diseases are diseases of the arteries. Over a number of years, deposits can start to form in the artery wall. This is called arterial plaque or atheroma, from the Greek word for porridge, because of the porridgelike consistency of these deposits. The presence of arterial deposits is called atherosclerosis, and it occurs only in certain parts of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Atherosclerosis, coupled with thicker-than-normal blood containing clots, can lead to a blockage in an artery, which stops the flow of blood. If this occurs in the arteries feeding the heart, the part of the heart fed by these blood vessels will die from lack of oxygen. This is called a myocardial infarction or heart attack. Before this occurs, many people are diagnosed as having angina, a condition in which there is a limited supply of oxygen to the heart owing to partial blockage of coronary arteries that feed oxygen plus glucose to the heart muscle, causing chest pain, most classically on exertion or when under stress.</p>
<p class="indent">If a blockage occurs in the brain, part of the brain may die. This is called a stroke. The arteries in the brain are especially fragile and sometimes a stroke occurs not as a result of a blockage but because an artery ruptures. <a id="page197"/>This is called a cerebral hemorrhage. If a blockage occurs in the legs, it can result in leg pain, which is a form of thrombosis (a thrombus is a blood clot). When peripheral arteries get blocked, this can result in poor peripheral circulation, for example, in the hands and feet.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s02"><strong>Reversing high blood pressure</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">So two main factors are responsible for so-called heart disease: atherosclerosis (the formation of deposits) and the presence of blood clots (thick blood). However, there is a third problem that can and usually does occur along with atherosclerosis. That is arteriosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries. Arteries are elastic and, whether or not atherosclerosis is present, tend to lose their elasticity and harden with age. One reason for this is a lack of vitamin C, which is needed to make collagen, the intercellular “glue” that keeps skin and arteries supple. Arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and thick blood can all raise blood pressure, putting you at greater risk of thrombosis, angina, a heart attack, or a stroke.</p>
<p class="indent">In the same way that the pressure in a hose increases and decreases as the tap is turned on and off, the pressure in the arteries increases when the heart beats and decreases in the lull before the next beat. These are called your systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, and a normal reading should be 120/80 irrespective of age. However, if the arteries are blocked, or if the blood is too thick, the pressure increases. Given that blood pressure increases with age in most people, conventional medical wisdom is that a systolic blood pressure of 100 plus your age (say 150 for a fifty-year-old) means that you are in “normal” health. Yet, these are the very same normal people who drop dead unexpectedly from heart attacks. These guidelines are certainly not ideal.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c23-s02-s01"><em>Strategies for lowering blood pressure</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">There are four ways to lower blood pressure.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c23-s02-s01-s01"><span class="small2">TAKING EXTRA MINERALS AND AVOIDING SALT</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">The arteries are surrounded by a layer of muscle, and an excess of sodium, or a lack of calcium, magnesium, or potassium, can increase the muscular pressure. Increasing your intake of these minerals, while avoiding added salt (sodium chloride), can make a substantial difference to blood pressure in just a month. Of these, magnesium is the most important. There is a strong association between magnesium deficiency and heart attack risk. A pronounced magnesium deficiency can cause a heart attack by cramping a coronary artery <a id="page198"/>even in the absence of an atherosclerotic blockage. So checking your magnesium level is essential.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c23-s02-s01-s02"><span class="small2">VITAMIN E PROTECTS YOUR ARTERIES</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Another way to change blood pressure is to thin the blood. Conventionally, aspirin is used and reduces the risk of a heart attack by 20 percent. Vitamin E, however, was four times as effective, according to Professor Morris Brown, whose double-blind controlled trial of vitamin E at Cambridge University Medical School showed a 75 percent reduction in heart attack risk.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts006" id="c23-nts006a"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">These results are consistent with many studies that show a reduced risk of heart attack, especially if vitamin E is given before a problem develops. In one study, whose findings were published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, 87,200 nurses were given 100 IU of vitamin E daily for more than two years. A 40 percent drop in fatal and nonfatal heart attacks was reported compared with the rate among those not taking vitamin E supplements.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts007" id="c23-nts007a"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a> In another study, 39,000 male health professionals were given 100 IU of vitamin E for the same length of time and achieved a 39 percent reduction in heart attacks.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts008" id="c23-nts008a"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">While these results confirm the first reports of vitamin E’s protective effect, made in the 1950s by Drs. Wilfred and Evan Shute, who treated thirty thousand patients with heart disease with an 80 percent success rate, not all trials have been positive. A trial at Oxford University, giving people who had had a heart attack 900 IU of vitamin E, plus 250 mg of vitamin C and beta-carotene, failed to find a reduction in mortality.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts009" id="c23-nts009a"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> I would suggest that if a person has had a heart attack, much better results could be achieved by making dietary changes, plus taking more substantial supplementation, including omega-3 fats.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c23-s02-s01-s03"><span class="small2">THE BENEFITS OF FISH OILS</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">The omega-3 fish oils, which contain EPA and DHA, have also been shown to reduce risk of heart disease. So too has eating fish. If you’ve had a heart attack and start eating omega-3-rich fish three times a week, you could halve your risk of a further heart attack. Other trials giving people omega-3 fish oils have found that they do indeed confer protection from heart disease.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts010" id="c23-nts010a"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> Exactly how they work is still under investigation. Omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory, and artery damage involves inflammation. They also thin the blood and, in combination with vitamin E, are much more effective and considerably safer than aspirin.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c23-s02-s01-s04"><a id="page199"/><span class="small2">NUTRITIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR NARROWING ARTERIES</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">However, the major risk associated with high blood pressure is the narrowing of arteries caused by atherosclerosis. A number of nutritional strategies have been shown to stop and even reverse this process. The main results have been produced by supplements of antioxidants, fish oil, and a combination of vitamin C and lysine. Vitamin C also helps stop arterial tissue from hardening, another cause of high blood pressure. Supplementing a combination of these nutrients is more effective in the long term than taking drugs designed to lower blood pressure—they deal with the cause of the problem, rather than the symptom. The results of a survey in Sweden showed that people who took supplements had a much lower risk of having a heart attack, with women reducing their risk by 34 percent and men by 21 percent.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts011" id="c23-nts011a"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">At the Institute for Optimum Nutrition we conducted a three-month trial on people with high blood pressure and achieved an average 8-point drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with the greatest decreases in those with the highest initial blood pressure.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts012" id="c23-nts012a"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a> Dr. Michael Colgan found that, irrespective of age, people placed on comprehensive nutritional supplement programs showed gradual decreases in blood pressure from an average of slightly above 140/90 to below 120/80. The optimal range is a systolic blood pressure no higher than 125 and a diastolic blood pressure no higher than 85, irrespective of age. Certainly blood pressure above 140/90 is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Colgan also found that pulse rate, which is more a measure of heart strength and is therefore lower in fitter people, decreased from 76 to an average of 65 over a period of five years among those on nutritional supplements. An ideal pulse rate is probably below 65 beats per minute.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s03"><strong>What causes heart disease?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">To understand how nutritional supplementation as well as dietary changes make all the difference, we need to examine the underlying cause of arterial disease. Back in 1913 a Russian scientist, Dr. Anitschkov, thought he had the answer. He found that feeding cholesterol (an animal fat) to rabbits induced heart disease. What he failed to realize was that rabbits, being vegetarians, have no means of dealing with this animal fat. Since the fatty deposits in the arteries of people with heart disease had also been found to be high in cholesterol, it was soon thought that these deposits were the result of excess cholesterol in the blood, possibly caused by excess cholesterol in the diet. <a id="page200"/>Such a simple theory had its attractions, and many doctors still advocate a low-cholesterol diet as the answer to heart disease—despite a consistent lack of results.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s04"><strong>The cholesterol myth</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In 1975, a research team headed by Dr. Alfin-Slater from the University of California decided to test the cholesterol theory.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts013" id="c23-nts013a"><sup class="frac">13</sup></a> They selected fifty healthy people with normal blood cholesterol levels. Half of them were given two eggs per day (in addition to the other cholesterol-rich foods they were already eating as part of their normal diet) for eight weeks. The other half were given one extra egg per day for four weeks, then two extra eggs per day for the next four weeks. The results showed no change in blood cholesterol. Later Dr. Alfin-Slater commented, “Our findings surprised us as much as ever.”</p>
<p class="indent">Many other studies have also found no rise in blood cholesterol levels caused by eating eggs. In fact, as long ago as 1974 a British advisory panel set up by the government to look at “medical aspects of food policy on diet related to cardiovascular disease” issued this statement: “Most of the dietary cholesterol in Western communities is derived from eggs, but we have found no evidence that relates the number of eggs consumed to heart disease.”</p>
<p class="indent">A review in 2000 of all studies that had investigated cholesterol and egg intake and heart disease, published in the <em>Journal of the American College of Nutrition</em>, concluded that “no association was seen between consumption of more than one egg per day and the risk of heart disease.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts014" id="c23-nts014a"><sup class="frac">14</sup></a> The bottom line is that there’s no evidence that eating up to seven eggs a week makes any difference to your cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Since high blood cholesterol levels are associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease, it is assumed that having a low cholesterol level is good news. Not so, according to three independent research groups. One, in Japan, found that while high levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, which is low in Japan, low levels are associated with strokes. As cholesterol levels dropped below 190 mg/dl in the blood in this group of 6,500 Japanese men, incidence of strokes increased. Meanwhile, a Finnish researcher, Jyrki Penttinen, has found low levels to be associated with a higher rate of depression, suicide, and death from violent causes.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts015" id="c23-nts015a"><sup class="frac">15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">These findings were confirmed by David Freedman of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta—he found that people with antisocial personality disorders had lower cholesterol levels. Freedman believes that very low levels of cholesterol lead to aggression.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page201"/>While there is no doubt that high blood cholesterol represents a risk factor for arterial disease, eating a diet containing moderate amounts of cholesterol, for example in eggs, is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease. So what is ideal? According to a survey carried out by medical researcher Dr. Cheraskin, comparing overall health with cholesterol levels, there is a very narrow band that represents a “healthy” cholesterol level in the blood.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts016" id="c23-nts016a"><sup class="frac">16</sup></a> This is between 190 and 210 mg/dl or 4.9 and 5.4 mmol/l. (Some countries, including Britain, measure cholesterol in mmol/l [millimoles per liter], while others, including the United States, use mg/dl [milligrams per deciliter].) Variations on either side correlate with increasing rates of disease. The British National Heart Forum recommends a cholesterol level below 5 mmol/l, while the national average is more like 5.5 mmol/l. They, however, set no minimum level, implying that the lower one’s cholesterol the better. This denies the fact that cholesterol is a vital precursor of hormones and much needed by the body and brain.</p>
<p class="center"><strong><span class="small2">TEST SCORES FOR CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH</span></strong></p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_043_r1.jpg"/></p>
<h3 class="section" id="c23-s04-s01"><em>Good cholesterol</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Of course, the nail in the coffin of the dietary cholesterol hypothesis was hammered in by the Inuit (Eskimos). Although they have one of the highest-cholesterol diets in the world, they also have one of the lowest incidences of cardiovascular disease. We now know that there is “good” and “bad” cholesterol.</p>
<p class="indent">When cholesterol, which is a component of bile, is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, it is carried to the arteries by a lipoprotein (fat-protein complex) called LDL (short for low-density lipoprotein). If a large proportion of a person’s cholesterol is combined with LDL, it is more likely to be deposited in the artery walls. Another lipoprotein called HDL (short for high-density lipoprotein) can take cholesterol out of the arteries and back to the liver. Not surprisingly, it has been popularized as “good” cholesterol—the higher a person’s HDL cholesterol compared with their LDL cholesterol, the lower <a id="page202"/>the risk. The ideal ratio is one part HDL cholesterol to three parts total cholesterol.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, multivitamin and mineral programs are highly effective at achieving this ideal cholesterol balance. Dr. Michael Colgan has demonstrated that by putting people on a supplement program for six months, then taking them off for three months, and doing this repeatedly over two years, he could consistently lower blood cholesterol and increase the ratio of HDL to LDL.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts017" id="c23-nts017a"><sup class="frac">17</sup></a> vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> (niacin) is also highly effective at increasing HDL levels, although you need to supplement 500 to 1,000 mg a day. Because niacin can produce an unfortunate blushing effect, many people take niacin inositolate or “no-flush” niacin.</p>
<p class="indent">Another effective way to raise HDL and lower LDL and total cholesterol is by consuming significant quantities of omega-3 oils.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts018" id="c23-nts018a"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a> In practical terms, this means taking an EPA fish oil supplement or eating a lot of oily fish. This is what is understood to have protected the Inuit.</p>
<p class="indent">Another important point about cholesterol is that, like any fat, it can be damaged by oxidation. Cigarette smoking, for instance, increases the oxidation of fats. Once damaged, cholesterol becomes more difficult to clear from the arteries. Oxidation can also injure the cells that line the artery wall, causing them to get clogged up. Antioxidant nutrients are protective, while low dietary and blood levels of beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E have repeatedly been shown to increase the risk of heart disease. By increasing intake of antioxidants and decreasing your exposure to free radicals (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c15_r1.htm">chapter 15</a>), you can reduce your risk.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of the right diet plus supplements is likely to be far quicker and more effective than the current main medical treatment—statin drugs. While these do lower the risks of both heart attack and stroke in the long term (there is usually no risk reduction in the first year) by blocking the enzyme that makes cholesterol, this enzyme also makes an important heart nutrient, coenzyme Q<sub class="frac">10</sub>, so blocking it potentially increases risk for heart failure since CoQ<sub class="frac">10</sub> is vital for the proper functioning of the heart itself. If you are on a statin drug, make sure you supplement at least 30 mg of CoQ<sub class="frac">10</sub>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s05"><strong>New theory on heart disease—lipoprotein A</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">According to Dr. Linus Pauling and Dr. Matthias Rath, even these factors may be but a small part of the underlying cause of atherosclerosis.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts019" id="c23-nts019a"><sup class="frac">19</sup></a> On the understanding that our ancestors lost the ability to make vitamin C when living in a tropical environment, Pauling and Rath wondered how we survived through repeated ice ages without dying from scurvy, a disease that once used <a id="page203"/>to decimate ships’ crews. The first sign of scurvy is vascular bleeding, as blood vessels start to leak—nowhere else in the body is membrane under such pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Pauling and Rath, we may have developed the ability to deposit lipoproteins along the artery wall in order to increase our chances of surviving during vitamin C-deficient times. Two groups of proteins that normally accumulate at injury sites to carry out repairs are fibrinogen and apoprotein. Apoproteins have a natural affinity with fat (lipids) and become lipoprotein A (LpA), which can repair damaged or leaky blood vessels. However, it also increases the risk of heart disease by building up deposits on artery walls. In fact, of all the factors that can be measured, a person’s level of lipoprotein A is the best indicator of risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Genetic research is now strongly suggesting that the development of lipoprotein A was most likely a genetic response to a threat of extinction through leaky blood vessels. Could this have been nature’s way of dealing with life-threatening scurvy? The estimated dates for the development of lipoprotein A in monkeys correlate with the period in which primates are thought to have lost the ability to produce vitamin C.</p>
<p class="indent">How well does the theory of vitamin C deficiency as a root cause for cardiovascular disease fit with the facts? Vitamin C deficiency raises cholesterol, triglycerides (fats in the blood), bad LDLs, apoprotein, and lipoprotein A and lowers the beneficial HDLs. Conversely, increasing vitamin C intake lowers a high cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, or LpA level and raises HDLs.</p>
<p class="indent">The significance of all these beneficial effects for our ancestors could have been that during the summer, when they could take in enough vitamin C, the increased HDL production would remove excess cholesterol. Vitamin C also inhibits excessive cholesterol production and helps convert cholesterol to bile. All this would lead to a decrease in unnecessary atherosclerotic deposits. In one study, it was shown that a daily 500 mg of vitamin C can lead to a reduction in atherosclerotic deposits within two to six months. “This concept also explains why heart attacks and strokes occur today with a much higher frequency in winter than during spring and summer, the seasons with increased ascorbate intake,” said Pauling.</p>
<p class="indent">If vitamin C deficiency does prove to be the common cause of human cardiovascular disease, then vitamin C supplementation is destined to become the universal treatment for this disease. Pauling and Rath recommend somewhere between 3 and 10 grams a day and, for those with cardiovascular disease, the addition of the amino acid lysine at around 3 grams a day. The combination of these two nutrients appears to reverse atherosclerosis.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s06"><a id="page204"/><strong>Homocysteine—the heart attacker</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">While a lack of vitamin C may weaken arteries, what actually causes the damage? One answer is a dangerous amino acid called homocysteine. If you’ve had a heart attack or stroke, there’s a more than 50 percent chance you have a high homocysteine level.</p>
<p class="indent">The homocysteine theory was first proposed by Dr. Kilmer McCully, a pathologist at the VA Medical Center in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1969. It wasn’t until the 1990s that the evidence for the homocysteine theory started to become very convincing.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts020" id="c23-nts020a"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a> In 1992, a study of fourteen thousand male doctors found that those with homocysteine levels in the top 5 percent had three times the heart attack risk, compared with those in the bottom 5 percent. This increased risk was confirmed by the Massachusetts-based Framingham Heart Study in 1995, which found that having more than 11.4 units of homocysteine in the blood increased the risk.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts021" id="c23-nts021a"><sup class="frac">21</sup></a> Another study at the University of Washington found that having high homocysteine doubles the risk of heart attack in young women.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_044_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>How lipoprotein A causes heart disease</em>.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_045_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page205"/><em>How homocysteine causes heart disease</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The real clincher was a study carried out by the European Concerted Action Group, a consortium of doctors and researchers from nineteen medical centers in nine European countries.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c23-nts022" id="c23-nts022a"><sup class="frac">22</sup></a> They studied 750 people under the age of sixty with atherosclerosis, compared with 800 people without such cardiovascular disease. They found that having a high level of homocysteine in the blood was as great a risk factor for cardiovascular disease as smoking or having a high blood cholesterol level.</p>
<p class="indent">To put this in perspective, every 12 percent increase in your homocysteine score triples your risk of a heart attack if you are a man. If you have both a high homocysteine score and a family history of heart disease, this increases your personal risk of heart attack, regardless of sex, a whopping thirteen to fourteen times! Those with a homocysteine level above 14 units have an 82 percent increased risk of total stroke, compared with those below 9.2 units. Since this study in 1998, more than a thousand studies have confirmed the incredibly strong link between homocysteine and heart disease—much stronger and more important than cholesterol, yet hardly ever tested.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page206"/>While much of the spotlight on heart disease diagnosis has been on cholesterol, the fact is that your homocysteine level is roughly forty times more predictive of a heart attack than your cholesterol level. Time and time again I encounter heart attack patients who don’t have high cholesterol levels, haven’t been checked for homocysteine, and are still put on cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins. While these drugs do decrease the rate of death from heart attacks, they don’t have as great an effect on overall mortality, adding, on average, a mere eighteen months to life. Lowering your homocysteine score, on the other hand, dramatically reduces death from all causes, not just heart attacks.</p>
<p class="indent">So the question is: how do you lower your homocysteine level? The answer is with B vitamins, not drugs. Specifically, folic acid, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. The ideal amount to supplement depends on your homocysteine level, but suffice it to say that anyone at any risk should be supplementing at least 400 mcg of folic acid, 12 mcg of vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and 50 mg of B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. Much larger amounts are needed to lower very raised homocysteine scores. Since homocysteine not only damages arteries but also damages cholesterol, making it accumulate in arteries, lowering your homocysteine can be expected to lower your cholesterol too. Homocysteine is discussed in full in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a>, together with details on how to lower it.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c23-s07"><strong>Supernutrition for a healthy heart</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Much is known about the causes of cardiovascular disease and how to prevent it, and no doubt more is yet to be discovered. However, few if any general practitioners are applying what is already known to prevent and reverse heart disease.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>The following guidelines apply to us all as a means of eliminating risk and adding at least ten healthy years to our life span</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Avoid fried food and limit your intake of meat and foods high in saturated fat. Oily fish such as mackerel, herring, salmon, and tuna are better.</li>
<li>Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, which are high in calcium, magnesium, and potassium, especially green, leafy vegetables and beans, which are high in folate.</li>
<li>Eat seeds, high in vitamin E, essential fats, and minerals.</li>
<li><a id="page207"/>Do not add salt when cooking, or to your plate, and restrict your consumption of foods with added salt. If you do use salt, use Solo salt.</li>
<li>Keep fit, not fat.</li>
<li>Don’t smoke.</li>
<li>Avoid prolonged stress.</li>
<li>Know your blood pressure and have your blood lipid level checked every five years.</li>
<li>Take a supplement of antioxidant nutrients, including at least 600 IU of vitamin E and 2 g of vitamin C, plus the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA and a multivitamin containing B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and folic acid.</li>
</ul>
<p class="center2"><strong>If you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, the following also apply</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>See a nutritionist and have your blood lipid levels and homocysteine measured.</li>
<li>If you have low HDL, take 1 gram of “no-flush” niacin a day.</li>
<li>If you have high cholesterol or triglycerides, take an EPA fish oil supplement giving you 1,000 mg of EPA.</li>
<li>If you have high lipoprotein A, take a supplement of at least 5 g of vitamin C and 3 g of lysine.</li>
<li>If you have high homocysteine, increase your intake of vitamins B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and folic acid (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a> for amounts).</li>
<li>If you have high blood pressure, take a magnesium supplement.</li>
<li>Do all you can to improve your diet and lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
