<h1 class="chapter" id="c01"><a id="page6"/><span class="big">1</span></h1>
<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Health—Who Wants to Be Average?</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">This book is a means to a goal—health. And that means not just an absence of disease, but also an abundance of vitality. Positive health, sometimes called functional health, can be measured in three ways:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Performance—how you perform physically and mentally</li>
<li>Absence of ill health—lack of disease signs and symptoms</li>
<li>Longevity—healthy life span</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">I believe the experience of a profound sense of well-being can be achieved by everyone. It is characterized by a consistent, clear, high level of energy; emotional balance; a sharp mind; a desire to maintain physical fitness; and a direct awareness of what suits our bodies, what enhances our health, and what our needs are in any given moment. This state of health includes resilience to infectious diseases and protection from the major killer diseases such as heart disease and cancer. As a result, the aging process is slowed down and we can live a long and healthy life. At its most profound level, health is not merely the absence of pain or tension, but a joy in living, a real appreciation of what it is to have a healthy body with which to taste the many pleasures of this world.</p>
<p class="indent">For me, this is not just a belief but also an experience that I have had personally and have also witnessed in many other people with whom I have worked over the years since I started to pursue optimum nutrition. Health has not been a static state, but an endless journey of learning about myself from the diseases and imbalances that I have suffered and a continuing discovery of even higher and clearer levels of energy. From these experiences, and those gained through working with thousands of people suffering from all categories of disease, I am totally convinced that, by means of optimum <a id="page7"/>nutrition, exercise, living in the right environment, and being willing to change obsolete beliefs and behavior patterns that create tension and stress, virtually all disease can be prevented.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s01"><strong>Health care—the fastest-growing failing business</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Nothing in Western culture really teaches us to be healthy. Apart from a little wisdom imparted by our parents, most of whom spend their later years in increasing pain, we are not taught how to be healthy at school, in college, or by the media. Government campaigns may advise against smoking and drinking, but there is little real guidance and few results. In the United States 2.3 billion alcoholic drinks are consumed each week, and an estimated 26 million men and 23 million women are smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p class="indent">What we call “health care” is really “disease care.” Described by Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, professor emeritus at the University of Alabama Medical School, as “the fastest-growing failing business,” modern medicine is failing to provide true health care and making a lot of money out of it. It is, says Cheraskin, “primary prevention of health deterioration.”</p>
<p class="indent">Take heart disease as an example. Currently, you have a 50 percent chance of acquiring heart disease during your life. It accounts for a quarter of all deaths before the age of sixty-five, and one in four men has a heart attack before retiring from work—half of these men don’t have high cholesterol levels! It is well accepted that high blood pressure is the leading warning of serious cardiovascular problems. Conventional medicine recommends weight loss and drugs to lower high blood pressure and cholesterol, but little heed is paid to the many dietary factors also known to achieve this end. Even 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily can significantly lower blood pressure, yet this is rarely recommended. A mere 750 IU of vitamin E daily reduces the risk of a heart attack in those with cardiovascular disease by 75 percent, according to a large-scale placebo-controlled trial undertaken at Cambridge University Medical School.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c01-nts001" id="c01-nts001a"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> Supplementing B vitamins, which lower homocysteine, an often ignored risk factor greater than cholesterol, can also halve the risks of both heart attacks and strokes.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c01-nts002" id="c01-nts002a"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to popular belief, the risk of death from many common types of cancer is increasing, not declining. Consider breast cancer, which accounts for one-third of all cancers diagnosed in women and around forty thousand deaths each year in the U.S. If treatments were working, women with breast cancer would live longer and be at less risk of dying. We are told that, in the last thirty years, the survival rate has increased from 60 to 75 percent. However, the death rate from cancer over the same period has steadily <a id="page8"/>increased. What has happened is that people are being diagnosed earlier and so appear to survive longer. We are losing the cancer war, not winning it.</p>
<p class="indent">According to medical expert Dr. John Lee, breast cancer is occurring more frequently and earlier in women’s lives than in the mid-1980s. Mammograms show microcalcifications in the breasts that could never have been picked up before. These are not the invasive tumors we need worry about, but they skew the statistics to show better survival rates. The usual treatment is surgery followed by the drug tamoxifen, yet medicated and nonmedicated patients do just as well. Dr. Lee believes the major cause of breast cancer is “unopposed estrogen” (normally balanced in the body with progesterone), and there are many factors that would lead to this situation. Stress, for example, raises levels of the hormone Cortisol, which competes with progesterone. So does insulin resistance, which is the consequence of eating too much sugar and refined carbohydrates. Xenoestrogens from the environment, found in pesticides and plastics among other common sources, can damage tissue and lead to increased cancer risk later in life. Milk, too, is a known promoter of breast and prostate cancer growth.</p>
<p class="indent">Clearly, there are also nutritional elements to consider. Yet doctors have continued to prescribe unopposed estrogen for women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for decades, despite clear evidence of risk back in 1989, when Dr. Bergfist’s study in Scandinavia showed that if a woman is on HRT for longer than five years she doubles her risk of breast cancer.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c01-nts003" id="c01-nts003a"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> This was followed by a study by the Rollins School of Public Health at Emery University in Atlanta, Georgia, which followed 240,000 women for eight years and found that the risk of fatal ovarian cancer was 72 percent higher in women given estrogen.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c01-nts004" id="c01-nts004a"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> However, it was only when the Million Women Study was published in <em>The Lancet</em> that HRT started to be phased out. The authors, whose research showed that use of combined estrogen-progestin HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 66 percent and risk of death by 22 percent, estimated that twenty thousand women had contracted breast cancer because of HRT in the last decade.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c01-nts005" id="c01-nts005a"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Taking another example, by the age of sixty, nine in every ten people have arthritis. Once the level of pain is unbearable, sufferers are recommended steroidal or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While both classes of drugs reduce the pain and swelling, they also speed up the progression of the disease. In the United States, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are a $30 billion industry—$17 billion for the drugs and $13 billion for treating the side effects. Thousands of people die from the side effects of these drugs alone. Yet there are proven, safe nutritional alternatives that have as great an anti-inflammatory effect without the harmful side effects.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page9"/>Put all these and other risks into the health equation and it is easy to understand why the average person today is destined to live a measly seventy-five years and spend the last twenty in poor health, when it is an established fact that a healthy human life span should be at least a hundred years. And the sad truth is that the statistics are not getting any better. For all our advances in drugs, surgical procedures, and medical technology, a man aged forty-five today can expect to live for only two more years than the same man in 1920, until seventy-four, instead of seventy-two. Conventional approaches to health care are clearly barking up the wrong tree. Perhaps what is needed is a new tree.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s02"><strong>The new idea of health</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Instead of thinking of the body as a machine, and disease as a monkey wrench in the works that must be removed or destroyed with drugs or surgery, medical scientists are now beginning to look at human beings as complex adaptive systems, more like a self-organizing jungle than a complicated computer. Rather than trying to “control” a person’s health by playing God with high-tech medicine, a new way of looking at health has emerged that considers a human being as a whole, with an interconnected mind and body designed to adapt to health if the circumstances are right.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, this adaptive capacity is not the same for everyone. We are each born with different strengths and weaknesses and different levels of resilience—some of us have what is popularly called “good genes” or come from “good stock,” and some of us do not. So, according to this new concept, our health is a result of the interaction between our inherited adaptive capacity and our circumstances. On a physical/chemical level, for example, that interaction would be between our genes and our environment. If our environment is sufficiently hostile (bad diet, pollution, exposure to viruses, allergens, and so on), we exceed our ability to adapt and we get sick.</p>
<p class="indent">Going back to cancer, we know that the risk is increased if we smoke, regularly drink alcohol, eat beef and dairy products, take certain drugs and hormones, and are exposed to exhaust fumes and other pollutants—to name a few. The risk, on the other hand, is lower if we have a high intake of certain vegetables, fibers, and antioxidants, such as beta-carotene and vitamins C and E, and live in an unpolluted environment. Evidence shows that, when the pluses significantly outweigh the minuses, health can be improved.</p>
<p class="indent">Genes and the environment are like the chicken and the egg. Science is proving that our genes are influenced by the environment in which we have evolved. Similarly, how we interact with our environment—for example, our ability to digest certain nutrients—depends on our genetics. I believe that the future of medicine will focus primarily on genetics and on environmental medicine, of which nutrition plays a major part, as the means to influence health. Genes, however, are harder to change than diet, so it is likely that nutrition will form the major part of the new approach to health care, along with strategies to reduce “antinutrients”—substances such as environmental pollutants, pesticides, and chemical food additives, which all interfere with the action of nutrients.</p>

<p class="figure"><a id="page10"/><strong><em>The new model of health</em></strong>. <em>Your genes interact with your environment (everything you eat, drink, and breathe) to create you. If you have good nutrition, the result is that you have the capacity to adapt to the stresses of life. That’s health. If your total environmental load exceeds your genetic capacity to adapt, you may develop disease</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, we are always being challenged—be it as the result of the neighbor’s cold or unavoidable exhaust fumes. What we take into our bodies—be it healthy food, drink, drugs, or junk—can dramatically affect our ability to stay healthy.</p>
