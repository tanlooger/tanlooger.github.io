<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Your Body Is 66</strong> <strong>Percent Water</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">It is an astonishing fact that the human body is basically two-thirds water. Without it most people are dead in four days. In normal circumstances, in twenty-four hours we lose 1.5 quarts of water in urine, 25.4 fl oz through the skin, 13.5 fl oz in the breath, and 5.1 fl oz in feces. That’s a total of 2.8 quarts a day.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c18-nts076" id="c18-nts076a"><sup class="frac">76</sup></a> A simple equation would suggest that this is what you need to drink.</p>
<p class="indent">It isn’t quite that simple, however. Firstly, the body makes water by metabolizing food, normally around 10.2 fl oz a day. Then there is the water in food itself, which normally provides around 1 quart a day. This totals 1.3 quarts, leaving the average person 1.5 quarts short on an average day. That’s the equivalent of six glasses of water.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s01"><strong>Why eight glasses is better</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Drinking a total of 1.5 quarts of water a day is really a minimum since, if it is hot or if you exercise, you will need more because you will sweat more. Also, drinking more is generally helpful for the kidneys. This is because many toxins, both those generated by the body and the ones that are consumed, are eliminated via the kidneys. By diluting the concentration of these toxins in the blood you give your kidneys an easier time, up to a point.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, it’s essential to ensure that enough fluid is available for the excretion of soluble minerals in the blood and nitrogenous waste material, especially from protein metabolism. The maximum intake from oral liquids should be that which the kidneys can reasonably excrete in twenty-four hours, and in adults this is around 2 quarts per day (2.45 to 2.7 fl oz/5 lbs body weight), <a id="page164"/>according to research by S. M. Kleiner at the University of Washington, published in the <em>Journal of the American Dietetics Association</em> in 1999.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c18-nts077" id="c18-nts077a"><sup class="frac">77</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to popular opinion, drinking more water doesn’t leach minerals from the body according to mineral expert Dr. Neil Ward of the University of Surrey (England), who has never found any evidence of this or reason why it would happen.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s02"><strong>Why more than eight glasses is worse</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Drinking more than you need, which is around 1.5 to 2 quarts a day in normal circumstances, isn’t better for you, and may be worse. This is because too much water taxes the kidneys and can lead to overhydration. Taken to the extreme this can kill you. A man died recently after drinking ten quarts in a few hours, while almost every year somebody dies from drinking too much water while on Ecstasy, for fear of drinking too little. This drug, and others, disturbs the normal thirst reflex. Far more people die as a consequence of drinking too little.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s03"><strong>What happens if you don’t get enough?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Water has many roles throughout the body other than flushing the kidneys, including dissolving minerals and acting as a delivery system, a lubricant, and a temperature regulator.</p>
<p class="indent">Even very mild dehydration can lead to constipation, headaches, lethargy, and mental confusion, while increasing the risk of urinary tract infections and kidney stones. When just 1 percent of body fluids are lost, body temperature goes up and concentration becomes more difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">The thirst mechanism kicks in when we’ve lost between 1 and 2 percent of body water. However, the thirst reflex is often mistaken for hunger. If we ignore it or mistake it for hunger, dehydration can continue to around 3 percent, where it seriously affects both mental and physical performance. Sports nutritionists have found that a 3 percent loss of body water results in an 8 percent loss in muscle strength.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Batmanghelidj, author of <em>Your Body’s Many Cries for Water</em>, cites many other health problems resulting from chronic low-level dehydration, including gastric ulcers (water is needed for the mucosal lining of your stomach and digestive system to protect it from your digestive juices), joint pain (the discs and cartilage cushioning joints are dependent on their water content for proper functioning), asthma and allergies (concentrated blood reaching the lungs results in increased production of histamine), and many more conditions. <a id="page165"/>After more than a decade of research, he confirms that we need a minimum of six to eight 8 oz. glasses of water per day.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c18-nts078" id="c18-nts078a"><sup class="frac">78</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s04"><strong>How to tell how much water you need</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">At first glance you’d think that thirst indicates only that you need more water. While this is obviously true in most circumstances, there are other factors that can trigger the thirst reflex. So if you’re constantly thirsty, it can mean that you don’t drink enough, but it could mean something else. The two most common reasons other than water deficiency are blood sugar problems and essential fat deficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">People with diabetes, or borderline diabetes, are often thirsty. This is because their blood sugar levels are too high—in these cases, the body wants to dilute glucose in the blood, which can be toxic to cells, by drinking more. This is why very sweet drinks make you drink more. It wouldn’t surprise me if the sugared-drink industry hadn’t worked out the perfect balance here to keep you drinking all day long!</p>
<p class="indent">The other reason for thirst is essential fat deficiency. Many people, especially children, are deficient in essential fats from fish and seeds and their oils. Without the right fats, cells can’t maintain their right water balance, and excessive thirst can result. The solution, of course, is to eat more fish, seeds, and cold-pressed seed oils or to supplement the essential fats.</p>
<p class="indent">Any combination of the symptoms below might help you become more in tune with your body’s cries for water.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Are you prone to constipation?</li>
<li>Are you often thirsty?</li>
<li>Do you have joint problems?</li>
<li>Do you feel tired?</li>
<li>Are you having difficulty concentrating?</li>
<li>Are you overheating?</li>
<li>Do you have dry skin, mouth, or lips?</li>
<li>Do you get frequent infections?</li>
<li>Do you have dry, brittle hair?</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The other way to tell whether you need to drink more is by checking the color of your urine. If your urine is very strongly colored, then you’re not drinking enough. This simple gauge is, however, complicated by the fact that riboflavin (vitamin B<sub class="frac">2</sub>) makes the urine a fluorescent kind of yellow. This is different from dark yellow, once you get used to it. Ideally, your urine should <a id="page166"/>be a light, straw-colored yellow. If, however, your urine is often clear, like water, you may be drinking too much and not taking in enough nutrients.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s05"><strong>Do tea and coffee count?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Water-consumption advice almost always specifically discounts caffeinated beverages, but this is now being questioned and may need revising. Caffeine does cause a loss of water, but only a fraction of what you’re adding by drinking the beverage. In people who don’t regularly consume caffeine, for example, researchers say that a cup of coffee actually adds about two-thirds the amount of hydrating fluid that’s in a cup of water.</p>
<p class="indent">Regular coffee and tea drinkers become accustomed to caffeine and lose little, if any, fluid. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American College of Nutrition</em>, researchers at the Center for Human Nutrition in Omaha, Nebraska, measured how different combinations of water, coffee, and caffeinated sodas affected the hydration status of eighteen healthy adults who drank caffeinated beverages routinely.<sup class="frac">79</sup> “We found no significant differences at all,” said nutritionist Ann Grandjean, the study’s leading author. “The purpose of the study was to find out if caffeine is dehydrating in healthy people who are drinking normal amounts of it. It is not.”</p>
<p class="indent">The same goes for tea, juice, milk, and caffeinated sodas: one glass provides about the same amount of hydrating fluid as a glass of water. The only common drinks that produce a net loss of fluids are those containing alcohol—and usually it takes more than one of those to cause noticeable dehydration, doctors say.</p>
<p class="indent">I would still advise the consumption of pure filtered or bottled water in preference to tea, coffee, sugary drinks, and juice because these drinks have effects other than just hydrating you. They all disrupt your blood sugar balance; tea, coffee, and cola rob the body of minerals; and sugary drinks (including some juice drinks) provide calories but few nutrients, hindering an optimal nutrient intake, as well as potentially causing too-high concentrations of glucose in the blood.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want hydration, go for water. If you don’t like water, try flavoring it with lemon, lime, ginger, mint, or herbal teas.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c18-s06"><strong>What’s the best water?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The best water to drink is natural mineral water, which contains significant amounts of minerals—for example, 60 to 100 mg of calcium in two quarts of water. This can be still or sparkling. Carbonation makes no difference to calcium <a id="page167"/>absorption. However, fizzy drinks containing phosphorus can inhibit calcium absorption, as can drinks containing caffeine. A cola drink that contains both is therefore bad news. If you drink only pure water or distilled water, ensure that you are getting all the minerals you need from your diet and supplements. The majority of water filters cannot help but remove some of the good minerals along with the bad, so the same applies. Most important of all, whatever kind of water you drink, make sure you drink enough.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Drink the equivalent of eight glasses of water a day, as water, diluted juices, or caffeine-free drinks.</li>
<li>Choose natural mineral water, pure water, or filtered tap water.</li>
</ul>
