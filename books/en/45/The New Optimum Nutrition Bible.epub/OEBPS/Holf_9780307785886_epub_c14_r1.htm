<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Toxic Minerals from</strong> <strong>Aluminum to Mercury</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Since optimum nutrition is about both increasing your intake of nutrients and avoiding antinutrients, it is well worth being aware of the toxic minerals that we are exposed to. These include aluminum, cadmium, copper, lead, and mercury. We are also exposed to some arsenic, present in some pesticides and herbicides, although this is most easily avoided by eating organic foods. There are others, but these are the major toxic minerals of concern because just about everybody is being unwittingly exposed to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Analyses of hair show that these undesirable elements tend to accumulate with age, suggesting that our exposure generally exceeds our ability to get rid of them. However, with some simple strategies you can dramatically reduce your load and increase your body’s ability to detoxify any residues in your body.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s how.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s01"><strong>Aluminum</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Aluminum is in widespread use in food packaging and turns up in many common household products. It’s in antacids, toothpaste tubes, deodorants, aluminum foil, pots and pans, and water. Not all aluminum will enter the body. Only in certain circumstances will aluminum leach, for example, from a pan. Old-fashioned aluminum cookware, if used to heat something acidic like tea, tomatoes, or rhubarb, will leach particles of aluminum into the water. Also, the more zinc-deficient you are the more you absorb.</p>
<p class="indent">Like many toxic metals, aluminum binds to essential vitamins and minerals, thus seriously compromising nutritional status. Although we know it interferes with brain function and memory, aluminum has also has been linked to kidney problems in babies and behavioral problems and autism in older children.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts030" id="c14-nts030a"><sup class="frac">30</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page119"/>In areas where there are high levels of aluminum in the water, studies have shown that there is a 50 percent greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD).<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts030"><sup class="frac">30</sup></a> While plenty of studies have shown increased accumulation of aluminum in people with AD, what isn’t clear is whether this is a cause or a consequence of the disease. The likelihood is that it’s a bit of both and still a significant contributor to memory problems. Numerous epidemiological surveys have linked aluminum intake from water to increased risk of AD. Other sources (food, medicines, toiletries, and cosmetics) are less well investigated.</p>
<p class="indent">In a study in the 1980s of 647 Canadian gold miners who had routinely inhaled aluminum since the 1940s (this used to be a common practice, thought to prevent silica poisoning), all tested in the “impaired” range for cognitive function, suggesting a clear link between aluminum and memory loss.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts031" id="c14-nts031a"><sup class="frac">31</sup></a> A number of recent review papers have kept aluminum firmly on the map of potential contributors to dementia and AD.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts032" id="c14-nts032a"><sup class="frac">32</sup></a> While the mechanism for action of aluminum in brain degeneration is far from clear, aluminum acts as an oxidant in the brain, especially in combination with excess copper.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts033" id="c14-nts033a"><sup class="frac">33</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s02"><strong>Cadmium</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Cadmium accumulates in the body and brain when zinc is low and builds up in the kidneys and liver, where it binds to other essential minerals and vitamins, thus preventing their utilization. In their study on mineral status in new babies, Professor Derek Bryce-Smith and Dr. Neil Ward, then at Reading University (England), found that cadmium levels are higher in the placentas of stillborn babies or those born with spina bifida. Greater accumulation of cadmium is also associated with low birth weight and small head circumference (therefore reduced brain size); and it reduces fertility in both men and women.</p>
<p class="indent">Our main sources of cadmium are cigarette smoke (directly or passively inhaled—according to the British Health Education Authority, only 15 percent of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker; the rest goes into the air and is inhaled by those close by) and refined grains found in processed foods. Cadmium is also widely used by the manufacturing industries and has even been found in shellfish from polluted waters.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s03"><strong>Copper</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Copper is both an essential element and a toxic one. Owing to the widespread use of copper in water pipes, plus exposure from jewelry, kitchen utensils, and even swimming pool antifungal agents, we are today more at risk from toxicity than from deficiency. The 2 mg we need each day is supplied simply <a id="page120"/>from drinking water that has passed through copper pipes, irrespective of any copper that is absorbed from our food. What’s more, long-term use of contraceptive pills, IUDs, and fertility hormones such as Clomid further increases copper levels in the body. Yet high levels of copper antagonize zinc and can induce deficiency.</p>
<p class="indent">Once a woman is pregnant, copper levels in her blood tend to rise dramatically and remain elevated until about a month after her child’s birth. The reason is believed to be because copper acts as a stimulus for the uterus. But if there’s already a high level to start with, the additional accumulation can cause copper toxicity, and this is far more common during pregnancy than at other times. In fact, too much too soon may be a factor in inducing premature babies or miscarriages.</p>
<p class="indent">High levels of copper may also be a factor in postpartum depression or mental illness, especially anxiety, paranoia, and schizophrenia. Consider this story. On vacation, I once met a headmaster of a school for “problem” children. We got talking about the effects of lead and other toxic metals on behavior and decided to set up a challenge. When we returned from vacation, he would send me a dozen hair samples from different students, which I would analyze and use to predict their behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">After receiving the hair samples, I ran the hair mineral analyses and found three abnormal results. One had a very high lead level. I predicted aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, and poor attention span. I was right. The child in question was the worst-behaved in the school! Two others had high copper levels. I predicted anxiety. They turned out to be a schoolteacher and his wife. They had recently moved into a new house, built in the grounds of the school, with new copper pipes in a soft-water area. The wife had started to become more and more anxious and had been prescribed medication. The husband was apparently free of symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">This story illustrates how easy it is to be copper toxic without knowing it. Copper excess, which can cause extreme fears, paranoia, and hallucinations, is rarely checked or tested in those with mental health problems, despite the fact that this link has been often reported in people with schizophrenia.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts034" id="c14-nts034a"><sup class="frac">34</sup></a> The copper may be the result of drinking water passing through copper pipes, or using copper pots and pans, birth control pills, and even copper IUDs. Or it could be the result of a deficiency of zinc, or of vitamin C or B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, which are copper antagonists. It also highlights the importance of drinking filtered or bottled water.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s04"><a id="page121"/><strong>Lead</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The first study to shake the status quo on lead toxicity was the Needleman study. Herbert Needleman, an associate professor of child psychiatry, looked at a group of 2,146 children in first- and second-grade schools in Birmingham, Alabama. He examined lead concentrations in shed baby teeth to obtain more long-term levels than shown by a simple blood test. He then asked the schoolteachers to rate the behavior of children they had taught for at least two months. This was done using a questionnaire designed to measure the teachers’ rating of children for a number of characteristics. He also ran a series of behavioral, intellectual, and physiological tests on each child before dividing the children into six groups according to the lead concentration in their teeth.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_028_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><strong><em>Classroom behavior in relation to dentine lead concentration: results for 2,146 children</em></strong>. <em>The higher the level of lead in a child’s baby teeth, the worse their behavior and learning ability is likely to be. By comparing 1 and 6 in each category (that is, the lowest and highest levels of lead), you can see a clear difference in behavior</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page122"/>As you can see, his results showed a clear relationship between lead concentrations and bad school behavior, as rated by the teachers without any knowledge of the children’s lead levels. Needleman also found that the average IQ for the high-lead children was 4.5 points below that of the low-lead group. Reaction time (a measure of attention capability) was also consistently worse in those with higher lead levels. EEG readings (which measure brainwave patterns) showed clear differences based on lead concentration. Perhaps the most interesting result was that none of the high-lead children had an IQ above 125 points (100 is average), compared with 5 percent in the low-lead group.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts035" id="c14-nts035a"><sup class="frac">35</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Richard Lansdown, principal psychologist at the London Hospital for Sick Children, and William Yule, psychologist at the University of London, decided to replicate the essentials of Needleman’s study on London children using lead levels in the blood instead of teeth. The 160 children involved had blood lead levels from 7 to 33 micrograms per decilitre, averaging 13.5 mcg/dl (35 mcg/dl is the “safe” level recommended by the Lawther report <em>Lead and Health</em>, 1980). This is similar to other national studies of mean lead levels. Again, the teachers rated the children’s behavior, and IQ and other tests were made. Lansdown’s results were even more striking than Needleman’s. The difference in IQ score between high- and low-lead children was seven IQ points. Once again, none of the high-lead children had an IQ above 125, while in the low-lead group, 5 percent did.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts036" id="c14-nts036a"><sup class="frac">36</sup></a> His findings have long since been proven by many other researchers and in fact helped bring about the banning of lead in gasoline.</p>
<p class="indent">Professor Derek Bryce-Smith has also found elevated levels of lead in the placentas of stillborn babies and those born with spina bifida or “water on the brain” (hydrocephalus).<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts037" id="c14-nts037a"><sup class="frac">37</sup></a> An American study also found higher levels of lead in babies who died of crib death.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts038" id="c14-nts038a"><sup class="frac">38</sup></a> Perhaps more interesting is the fact that this correlation exists even in mothers whose lead levels would be considered normal. As with many environmental poisons, there appears to be no threshold at which lead can categorically be called safe.</p>
<p class="indent">The important lesson to learn from lead is that tiny changes in what we ingest can have vast consequences for our health, which, although invisible to the eye, have been proven by research. Banning lead in gasoline was the first campaign of the Institute for Optimum Nutrition, working with Professor Bryce-Smith. There are many others yet to be won.</p>
<p class="indent">Although our lead exposure today may be less than it was in previous decades, lead pollution is still present in the atmosphere (it’s even been found in the polar ice caps) and also comes from water contaminated by lead piping and from flaking paint and paint dust, pesticides, cosmetics, and industrial <a id="page123"/>exposure. When intakes of the essential minerals calcium, zinc, or iron are low, lead becomes that much more toxic. Given that many people are deficient in all three, it’s important to redress the balance through diet and supplements.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s05"><strong>Mercury</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Mercury is the reason nineteenth-century hatters went mad. By polishing top hats with mercury, they became overloaded with this toxic element, which disturbs brain function and makes you crazy. Mercury is very toxic indeed and small amounts reach us from contaminated foods and from tooth fillings. Of particular concern is fish caught in polluted waters.</p>
<p class="indent">Mercury is used in a number of chemical processes, and accidents and illegal dumping have led to increased mercury levels in some areas, including the seashores and lakes of the U.S. Fish, especially larger species like tuna, store the mercury, which we then ingest. Fortunately, tuna is high in selenium, a mercury protector. Mercury has also been used as a constituent of thimerosal, found in diphtheria and hepatitis vaccines. This practice has recently been stopped.</p>
<p class="indent">Sadly, owing to widespread pollution, fish are one of our biggest sources of mercury. The larger and fattier, the greater the accumulation—up to two million times the amount found in the water.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts039" id="c14-nts039a"><sup class="frac">39</sup></a> One in twelve American women of childbearing age has potentially hazardous levels of mercury in her blood as a result of consuming fish, according to government scientists.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts040" id="c14-nts040a"><sup class="frac">40</sup></a> As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that pregnant women don’t eat tuna, shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. In the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency advises women who intend to become pregnant and those who are pregnant or breast-feeding to limit their consumption of tuna to no more than two medium-size cans or one fresh tuna steak per week. It also advises avoiding shark, swordfish, and marlin altogether.</p>
<p class="indent">Mercury is also found in water contaminated by industrial processes and in pesticides, but besides fish, our other most common source of this toxic metal is dental fillings. The mercury in teeth is not totally immobile and it’s possible to detect traces of mercury in the breath of people with mercury fillings. After fillings have been fitted or removed, urinary mercury may also show a slight increase. Sweden has now banned mercury fillings for pregnant women.</p>
<p class="indent">Autopsies on brains from AD patients, compared with those of control patients of the same age, have shown raised levels of mercury.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts041" id="c14-nts041a"><sup class="frac">41</sup></a> Researchers from the University of Basle, Switzerland, have also found high blood mercury levels, more than double those of the control groups, in AD patients, <a id="page124"/>with early-onset AD patients having the highest mercury levels of all.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts042" id="c14-nts042a"><sup class="frac">42</sup></a> Trace amounts of mercury can cause the type of damage to nerves that is characteristic of AD, according to recent research at the University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine, strongly suggesting that the small amounts we are exposed to, for example, from amalgam fillings, may be contributing to memory loss.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts043" id="c14-nts043a"><sup class="frac">43</sup></a> Although the research on the link of mercury to AD is in its infancy, it is certainly logical to reduce exposure to this highly toxic metal.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s06"><strong>Detoxifying your body</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">You can easily test your own mineral levels with a hair mineral analysis (see Resources). But what do you do if you have raised levels of toxic minerals?</p>
<p class="indent">Once we’ve ingested toxic minerals, they must compete with other minerals for absorption. These minerals are called antagonists and form our first line of defense. Once a mineral has been absorbed, some natural body substances latch on to it and try to take it out of the body. These are called chelators (pronounced key-lay-tors).</p>
<p class="indent">It is the latter principle that lies behind the administration of two drugs, penicillamine and EDTA, given to get rid of heavy metals. However, vitamin C is even better. In a study of rats with high concentrations of lead in their brains, administering EDTA resulted in an 8 percent lowering of lead, while vitamin C decreased levels by 22 percent.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts044" id="c14-nts044a"><sup class="frac">44</sup></a> Vitamin C is a virtuoso with the ability to latch on to most heavy metals in the blood and escort them out, sacrificing itself in the process. So high metal burdens call for more vitamin C. It is effective in removing lead, arsenic, and cadmium and is a most important part of any detoxification program.</p>
<p class="indent">Another substance that is known to lower lead levels is zinc, which acts as an antagonist to lead by preventing its absorption in the gut. Zinc also lowers body and brain levels of cadmium. Indeed, most of us could benefit from extra zinc. In addition, calcium is effective at keeping down lead levels, since lead otherwise stores more easily in our bones.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping calcium levels full to capacity pushes lead out and prevents the rapid rise in toxic minerals that, according to research by Dr. Ellen O’Flaherty at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, occurs at a rate of 15 percent following menopause.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c14-nts045" id="c14-nts045a"><sup class="frac">45</sup></a> Calcium is particularly effective at keeping down cadmium and aluminum levels. Toxic elements such as lead and uranium accumulate in bone tissue over a lifetime of repeated exposure and are released into the bloodstream as bone tissue breaks down. Bone loss can increase dramatically following menopause, which explains the rise in blood lead levels found in O’Flaherty’s research.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page125"/>Selenium is specifically a mercury antagonist and normally protects us from the mercury present in most seafood. Supplementing an extra dose is always a good idea if there are signs of excess mercury. It also has a similar protective effect with arsenic and cadmium, although it is not so pronounced.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s06-s01"><em>Foods that fight heavy metals</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">In terms of specific foods, there are a few that can help keep your brain clean. Sulfur-containing amino acids are found as the proteins in garlic, onions, and eggs. The specific amino acids are called methionine and cystine and protect against mercury, cadmium, and lead toxicity. Alginic acid in seaweed and pectin in apples, carrots, and citrus fruits also help chelate and remove heavy metals, thereby promoting your health. One more reason for an apple a day.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>A few simple steps</strong> <strong>you can take to avoid toxic minerals</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Avoid busy roads and smoky atmospheres where possible.</li>
<li>Remove outer leaves of vegetables and thoroughly wash all fresh produce in a vinegar solution (just add a teaspoonful to a bowl of water) to remove pollutants.</li>
<li>Limit your intake of marlin, swordfish, or tuna to no more than twice a month.</li>
<li>Avoid copper or aluminum cookware and don’t wrap food in aluminum foil (or if you do, put a layer of greaseproof paper in between foil and food).</li>
<li>Cut down on alcohol, as this increases lead and cadmium absorption.</li>
<li>Avoid antacids, which can contain aluminum salts.</li>
<li>Check whether your water pipes are made of lead or copper. If they are, don’t use a water softener, as soft water dissolves lead or copper more easily; do not drink or cook with hot tap water; use a water filter or drink distilled or natural water.</li>
<li>Take a good antioxidant supplement.</li>
<li>Eat mineral-rich foods, such as seeds and nuts.</li>
<li>Eat fruit rich in pectin and vitamin C.</li>
<li>Supplement vitamin C every day, as this protects you from toxic minerals, plus a multimineral containing zinc, calcium, and selenium.</li>
</ul>
