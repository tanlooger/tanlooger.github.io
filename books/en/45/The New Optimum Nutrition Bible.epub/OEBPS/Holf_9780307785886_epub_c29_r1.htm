<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Increasing Your Energy</strong> <strong>and Resistance to Stress</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">As a nutritionist, the two most common complaints I hear from my clients are that they lack energy and are under too much stress. The net result is tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy, apathy, poor concentration, lack of motivation—whatever expression you use, the feeling is the same. Many people turn to sugary food, coffee, or cigarettes or become “adrenaline junkies” with high-powered jobs or exhilarating pastimes to regain this feeling of energy. Yet often these attempted solutions only generate more stress, and soon they feel out of control and stressed-out on the roller coaster of life. Stress is one of the most common health problems, associated with a wide variety of illnesses and accounting for the loss of 200 million working days a year in the U.S. But what has it got to do with nutrition?</p>
<p class="indent">One surprising result that emerged from a survey of patients seen at the Institute for Optimum Nutrition clinic was that, before consulting a nutritionist, 54 percent of them scored high on a questionnaire concerning their ability to cope with stress, yet within six months of starting their optimum nutrition regimes only 28 percent still had a high stress rating. For the rest, whatever happened during those six months improved their ability to cope.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c29-s01"><strong>The chemistry of stress</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Your body chemistry changes fundamentally every time you react stressfully. Stress starts in the mind. We perceive a situation as requiring our immediate attention—a young child stepping into the road, a car driving too close to us, a hostile reaction from a colleague, a financial crisis, an impossible deadline. Rapid signals stimulate the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline. Within seconds, your heart is pounding, your breathing changes, stores of glucose <a id="page256"/>are released into the blood, the muscles tense, the eyes dilate, even the blood thickens. You are ready for fight or flight—the average adrenaline rush of a commuter stuck in a traffic jam is enough to keep her running for a mile. That represents how much glucose is released, mainly by breaking down glycogen held in muscles and the liver.</p>
<p class="indent">To get the fuel into the body, the pancreas releases two hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin, aided by a substance released from the liver, glucose tolerance factor, helps carry the fuel out of the blood; glucagon replenishes the blood sugar if its levels get too low. All this happens as a result of a stressful thought. Where, you might wonder, does all this extra energy and increased alertness come from? The answer is from a diversion of energy from the body’s normal repair and maintenance jobs such as digesting, cleansing, and rejuvenating. So every moment you spend in a state of stress speeds up the aging process in your body. It is stressful just thinking about it!</p>
<p class="indent">The effects of prolonged stress are even more insidious than that. Imagine your pituitary, adrenals, pancreas, and liver perpetually pumping out hormones to control blood sugar that you do not even need. Like a car driven too fast, the body goes out of balance and parts start to wear out. Levels of the antiaging adrenal hormone start to fall, as do those of Cortisol, and before long your body simply cannot respond to stress as it used to.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c29-s01-s01"><em>The blood sugar blues</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">As a consequence, your energy level drops, you lose concentration, get confused, suffer from bouts of “brain fatigue,” fall asleep after meals, get irritable, freak out, cannot sleep, cannot wake up, sweat too much, get headaches … sound familiar? In an attempt to regain control, most people turn to stimulants. Legal stimulants include coffee (containing theobromine, theophylline, and caffeine), tea (containing caffeine), cola drinks (containing caffeine), chocolate (containing caffeine and theobromine), cigarettes (containing nicotine), and psychological stimulants such as horror films or bungee jumping—something to put you on the edge. Illegal stimulants include amphetamines and other “uppers,” cocaine, crack, and crime. Naturally, it becomes increasingly difficult to relax while living on stimulants, so most people learn to use relaxants such as alcohol, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, cannabis, and so on.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c29-s01-s02"><em>Addicted to stress</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Of course, you cannot live like this forever, so most people burn out and have to head for the beach to recover. Yet as they wait in the airport, what better <a id="page257"/>way to relax than by reading a paperback thriller? The cover promises “murder, mystery, greed, lust, gripping suspense.” Sounds good. Backed up by a cup of coffee, a glass of wine, and a stressful journey, they arrive ready for the beach. Then, after two blissful hours engrossed in raunchy pulp fiction on the beach, it is time for some excitement—windsurfing, waterskiing, something exhilarating. The point is that most people become addicted to stress, because without it they come crashing down, revealing their true state of adrenal exhaustion. This is why people feel exhausted or get ill when they take time off.</p>

<p class="indent">If you have three or more of the symptoms printed in bold type, you may have an adrenal hormonal imbalance. If you also have five or more of the other symptoms, this warrants investigation by a nutritionist.</p>
<h3 class="section"><em>Energy consumers</em></h3>
<p class="indent">Yet in a very real sense, all stressors and stimulants consume our energy The “high” is literally energy leaving the system, like a wave that breaks and seems for a few seconds to be full of energy. Yet a few seconds later there is no wave at all—likewise the energy is gone.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page258"/>In an article on drug abuse, psychologist and philosopher Oscar Ichazo says, “Drugs (all of them) can be characterized as ‘energy consumers,’ consuming energy at a rate much greater than our natural ability to replace it. As drugs burn all our accumulated vitality in short periods of time, the brief exaltation is inevitably followed by depletion of vital energy, felt as the ‘down,’ the depressant effect of drugs. Nothing can replace a natural, clean body capable of producing natural and clean vital energy.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c29-nts020" id="c29-nts020a"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a> He rates the drugs most damaging to our vital energy, in descending order of harmfulness, as alcohol, heroin and opiates, tobacco, cocaine, barbiturates, antidepressants, amphetamines, marijuana, and caffeine.</p>
<p class="indent">But what does it mean to “consume energy”? It means that body cells are starved of fuel nutrients like glucose and catalyst nutrients like B vitamins, which drive the enzyme systems necessary to release energy from fuel nutrients. The nutrients necessary to make messenger molecules like neurotransmitters, or carrier molecules like insulin, are also depleted. So every moment you spend in a stressful state you are using up valuable nutrients. Consider this: Have you ever had a massage, after which you felt as if a whole load of muscular tension had gone? Every single muscle cell that you hold in tension, often for decades, even when you are asleep, is consuming energy, B vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium—to name but a few—just to stay in that state of tension. If you could relax all the muscles in your body, think how much you would save in nutritional supplements! Conservative estimates suggest that you double your need for vitamins when you are in a stressed state.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c29-s02"><strong>The energy equation</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">If you want to maximize your available energy for life, and to retain that energy rather than burning out, the nutritional message is simple:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Eat slow-releasing carbohydrates—ones that release their “fuel” slowly.</li>
<li>Ensure you have optimal intakes of all essential nutrients—vitamins, minerals, and others.</li>
<li>Avoid stimulants and depressants.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The resultant increase in energy will help you cope with the stresses and strains of life. The optimum nutrition approach is both a way of breaking energy-consuming patterns that keep depleting us and a method of regenerating energy for breaking the mental habits that initiate a stress response in the first place. So let’s examine what stress-busting optimum nutrition actually means.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c29-s03"><a id="page259"/><strong>The antistress diet</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Fast-releasing sugars create a state of stress in the body, stimulating the release of Cortisol. So avoid eating white bread, sweets, and breakfast cereals or other foods with added sugar. Slow-releasing carbohydrates, on the other hand, provide an “even keel” of consistent energy. Scientists have investigated exactly what effect different sources of carbohydrates have on blood sugar, energy, and mood. In general, the slow-releasing carbohydrates are fruit, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds; a more complete list of these foods is given in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c10_r1.htm">chapter 10</a>. Contrary to the rules of classic food combining (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c19_r1.htm#page169">this page</a>), recent research has found that eating some protein with carbohydrate provides additional adrenal support by reducing the stimulation of Cortisol. So if you are stressed out, eat your fruit with some nuts, or brown rice with fish. Nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils already contain both protein and carbohydrate and are therefore good antistress foods.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c29-s04"><strong>The energy nutrients</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Energy nutrients include vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub> and zinc, which help insulin work; vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> and chromium, which are part of the glucose tolerance factor and now available as a complex called chromium polynicotinate; and a whole host of nutrients required to turn glucose within cells into energy. These include vitamins B<sub class="frac">1</sub>, B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, B<sub class="frac">3</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">5</sub> and coenzyme Q<sub class="frac">10</sub>, vitamin C, iron, copper, and magnesium. vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub> is required to make adrenaline, while B<sub class="frac">5</sub> (pantothenic acid) is required to make another class of adrenal hormones called glucocorticoids. Muscle and nerve transmission, the end result of turning fuel into energy, requires yet more B<sub class="frac">5</sub> and large amounts of the semiessential nutrient choline, plus the minerals calcium and magnesium. Choline is also needed to produce stress hormones. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are also the building blocks of stress hormones and neurotransmitters. Methionine, an amino acid that is commonly deficient, is required to make adrenal hormones. Insulin is a complex of fifty-one amino acids and zinc. Adrenaline is synthesized from the amino acids phenylalanine or tyrosine.</p>
<p class="indent">The ideal quantity to take in supplement form to provide top-level support for stressed people, and to maximize energy, depends very much on individual circumstances. Optimal daily requirements, however, are likely to be in the ranges shown in the following table.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c29-s05"><strong>Stimulants and their alternatives</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Consumption of coffee, tea, sugar, or chocolate is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. In the short term, it may give a boost, but in the long term high stimulant consumption can kill you prematurely. Try this simple experiment. Give up all these stimulants for one month, and notice what happens. The more damage the stimulants are doing to you, the greater the withdrawal effect such as headaches, lack of concentration, fatigue, and nausea. (Fortunately, by eating slow-releasing carbohydrates and taking energy nutrients as supplements, you can minimize the withdrawal symptoms, which usually last no more than four days.)</p>
<p class="indent">Then start again and notice what happens with your first cup of tea or coffee, your first spoonful of sugar or bite of chocolate. You will experience what stress expert Dr. Hans Selye called the “initial response”—in other words, a true response to these powerful chemicals (a pounding head, hyperactive mind, fast heartbeat, and insomnia, followed by extreme drowsiness). Keep on the stimulants and you will adapt (phase 2). Keep doing this long enough and eventually you hit exhaustion (phase 3). This happens to everybody. The only variation is how long it will take you to get to the exhaustion phase.</p>
<p class="indent">Recovery is not only possible, it is usually rapid. Most people experience substantially more energy and ability to cope with stress within thirty days of <a id="page261"/>cutting out stimulants and simultaneously taking nutritional support. Coffee, tea, and chocolate are best omitted from your diet altogether, since even decaffeinated coffee and tea still contain stimulants. Nowadays, there are plenty of coffee alternatives and herb and fruit teas. Health food stores also have sugar-free “candy” and bars. Check the label for hidden sugar.</p>
<p class="indent">It is best to reduce the sugar content of your diet slowly. Gradually get used to less sweetness. For example, sweeten breakfast cereal with fruit. Dilute fruit juices by half with water. Avoid foods with added sugar. Limit your intake of dried fruit. Eat fruits that contain fast-releasing sugars, like bananas, with slow-releasing carbohydrates, such as oats.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c29-s05-s01"><em>Natural stimulants</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">If you still need a boost, especially during the first week off caffeine, you can do it the natural way. The body makes adrenaline, and its cousins the “feel-good” neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline, directly from an amino acid called tyrosine. Supplementing 1,000 mg of tyrosine on an empty stomach or with some carbohydrate, such as a piece of fruit, gives a positive lift. This is well worth it in the week you’re quitting caffeine.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to tyrosine, there are a number of “adaptogenic” herbs. These include Asian ginseng, Siberian ginseng, reishi mushrooms, and rhodiola. While rhodiola was a favorite in Siberia, reishi mushroom is one of the most respected tonics in Chinese medicine. In Asia, it has been revered for as long as five thousand years. These herbs are called adaptogens because they help even out and maintain normal levels of another energy-giving adrenal hormone called Cortisol. These are all available as herbal supplements, and you can also find them combined with tyrosine (see Resources).</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c29-s06"><strong>The exercise factor</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Exercise plays an essential role in both energy and stress resistance, but it has to be the right kind. Becoming muscle-bound doesn’t necessarily enable vital energy to flow easily in the body, nor does an unfit body or a body full of tension. This tension eats up our energy—it takes a lot of energy to keep muscle cells in tension. Conversely, being unfit and overweight places a strain on the body, again depleting vital energy.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c29-s06-s01"><em>Strength, suppleness, and stamina</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Somewhere in the middle there is an optimal balance where the body is relaxed but strong, supple, with good posture, and sufficiently fit to have the <a id="page262"/>stamina necessary for physical tasks. Remember the three Ss—strength, suppleness, and stamina. The body produces energy when carbohydrate foods react with oxygen from the air we breathe. Oxygen is the most vital nutrient of all, yet most of us breathe shallowly and use only a third of our lung capacity. Deeper breathing not only energizes the body; it also clears the mind. Mastering the right way to breathe is the first step in most forms of meditation, yoga, and tai chi. Most types of exercise ignore this, so you get out of breath. The resultant oxygen deficiency allows toxic substances to build up, generating tension in the body. If you feel exhausted or stiff after exercising, something is unbalanced in your exercise program.</p>
<p class="indent">If you could develop stamina, suppleness, strength, and a beautiful body by spending fifteen minutes a day on an exercise system that anyone can do anywhere, that leaves you feeling physically energized, emotionally balanced, and mentally clear, would you do it? Such an exercise system exists. It is called Psychocalisthenics®, and was developed by Oscar Ichazo, founder of the Arica Institute.<a class="hlink" href="#c29-ftn1" id="c29-ftn1a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> The word means strength (<em>sthenos</em>) and beauty (<em>kallos</em>) through the breath (psyche) and involves a unique series of twenty-two exercises that develop the three Ss and oxygenate the whole body. Psychocalisthenics is suitable for anyone, young or old, and takes only a day to learn. Classes take place all over the United States and Britain (for details see Resources), or you can do it by yourself accompanied by a CD or DVD.</p>
<p class="indent">Too much exercise can elevate levels of the stress hormone Cortisol and is not recommended if you are stressed out. On the other hand, Psychocalisthenics, yoga, tai chi, walking for half an hour, or meditation can help to rebalance stress hormones.</p>
<p class="indent">Meditation is as important to the mind as food is to the body. While food makes the body, thoughts make the mind. For maximum energy, eat pure food and have pure thoughts. Meditation is a time you set aside to sit in silence, focusing on something simple (the breath, a mantra, a prayer), letting go of your endless stream of thoughts, and tapping into the source of energy within every human being, from which come creativity, joy, natural humor, and lightness.</p>
<p class="indent">I like to start each day with fifteen minutes of meditation, followed by fifteen minutes of Psychocalisthenics, followed by Get Up and Go, my special breakfast made from high-energy whole foods plus energy nutrients. (Get Up and Go is available from health food stores, or by mail order, see Resources.) The result is a consistent level of energy and resistance to stress.</p>
