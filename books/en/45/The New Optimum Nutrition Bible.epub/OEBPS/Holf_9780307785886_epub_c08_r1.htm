<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>The Protein Controversy</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">What words do you associate with protein?… Meat, eggs, cheese, muscles, growth. You have to eat these foods to get enough protein to grow big and strong. The protein in meat is more usable than the protein in plants. If you do muscle-building exercise, you need more protein … Right or wrong? Many myths abound about protein, how much you need and the best food sources.</p>
<p class="indent">The word <em>protein</em> itself is derived from <em>protos</em>, a Greek word meaning “first,” since protein is the basic material of all living cells. The human body, for example, contains approximately 65 percent water and 25 percent protein. Protein is made out of nitrogen-containing molecules called amino acids. Some twenty-five different amino acids are pieced together in varying combinations to make different kinds of protein, which form the material for our cells and organs in much the same way that letters make words that combine to form sentences and paragraphs.</p>
<p class="indent">From the eight basic amino acids most of the remaining seventeen can be made. These eight are termed essential amino acids and the body cannot function without them, although others are semiessential under certain conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of the basic eight deserves its own optimal daily allowance, although these have yet to be set. The balance of these eight amino acids in the protein of any given food determines its quality or usability. So how much protein do you need, and what is the best-quality protein?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s01"><strong>Protein—are you getting enough?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Estimates for protein requirement vary depending on whom you speak to. This is not so surprising, since there may be widespread “biochemical individuality.” <a id="page53"/>In some countries, the estimate is as low as 2.5 percent of total calorie intake. The World Health Organization estimates that we need 4.5 percent of total calories from protein, while the U.S. National Research Council adds a safety margin and regards 8 percent as adequate for 95 percent of the population. The World Health Organization builds in a safety margin and recommends around 10 percent of total calories from protein, or about 35 grams of protein a day. The estimated average daily requirement, according to the UK Department of Health, is 36 grams for women and 44 grams for men. If the quality of protein is high, less needs to be eaten. At the other end of the spectrum are very high-protein diets, unwisely recommended for weight loss. These often contain 100 to 200 grams of protein a day. This is much too high.</p>
<p class="indent">So which foods provide more than 10 percent of their calories from protein? You may be surprised to learn that virtually every lentil, bean, nut, seed, and grain and most vegetables and fruit provide more than 10 percent protein. In soybeans, 54 percent of the calories come from protein, compared with 26 percent in kidney beans. Grains vary from 16 percent for quinoa to 4 percent for corn. Nuts and seeds range from 21 percent for pumpkin seeds to 12 percent for cashews. Fruit goes from 16 percent for lemons down to 1 percent for apples. Vegetables vary from 49 percent for spinach to 11 percent for potatoes.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_007_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><strong><em>The amino acid family</em></strong>. <em>For a protein food source to contain “complete” protein, it must contain the eight essential amino acids. This is what you find in meat, fish, eggs, soybeans, and quinoa. The semiessential amino acids are also found in these foods. Taurine appears to be essential in infancy</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page54"/>What this means is that if you are eating enough calories you are almost certainly getting enough protein, unless you are living off high-sugar, high-fat junk food. This may come as a surprise, contradicting all we are taught about protein. Yet the fact of the matter is, to quote a team of Harvard scientists investigating vegetarian diets, “It is difficult to obtain a mixed vegetable diet that will produce an appreciable loss of body protein.” But surely animal protein is better quality than plant protein?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s02"><strong>Animal or vegetable?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Once again, there are a few surprises. Top of the class is quinoa (pronounced keenwa), a high-protein grain from South America that was a staple food of the Incas and Aztecs. Soybeans also do well. Most vegetables are relatively low in the amino acids methionine and lysine; however, beans and lentils are rich in methionine. Soybeans and quinoa are excellent sources of both lysine and methionine.</p>
<p class="indent">Early theories, such as those first expounded by Frances Moore Lappe in her groundbreaking vegetarian cookbook <em>Diet for a Small Planet</em>, suggested that vegetable proteins had to be carefully combined with complementary proteins in order to match the quality of animal proteins. However, we have since learned that careful combining of plant-based proteins is quite unnecessary. As Lappe says in the revised edition of her book, “With a healthy, varied diet, concern about protein complementarity is not necessary for most of us.”</p>
<p class="indent">Even so, you can increase the effective quality of the protein you eat by combining foods from different groups so low levels of certain amino acids in one food group are made up by high levels in another. Over a forty-eight-hour period, aim to eat a varied diet across the food groups shown in the illustration below. The combination of rice with lentils, for example, increases the protein value by a third. This is, of course, the basis of the diet in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_008_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page55"/><em>Combining foods for more complete protein</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s03"><a id="page56"/><strong>The best protein foods</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The best foods to eat for protein are not necessarily those that are highest in protein. The pros and cons of a food’s other nutritional constituents have to be taken into account. A lamb chop, for example, provides 25 percent of total calories as protein and 75 percent as fat, much of which is saturated fat. Half the calories in soybeans come from protein, so they are actually a better source of protein than lamb, but their real advantage is that the rest of the calories come from desirable complex carbohydrates. They also contain no saturated fat. This makes foods made from soy ideal, especially for vegetarians.</p>
<p class="indent">The easiest way to eat soy is in the form of tofu, a curd made from the beans. There are many kinds of tofu—soft, hard, marinated, smoked, and braised. Soft tofu can be used to give a creamy texture to soups. Hard tofu can be cubed and used in vegetable stir-fries, stews, and casseroles. Since tofu is quite tasteless, it is best to use it with well-flavored foods or sauces.</p>
<p class="indent">Quinoa has been grown in South America for five thousand years and has a long-standing reputation as a source of strength for those working at high altitudes. Called the “mother grain” because of its sustaining properties, it contains protein of a better quality than that of meat. Although known as a grain, quinoa is technically a seed. Like other seeds, it’s rich in essential fats, vitamins, and minerals, providing almost four times as much calcium as wheat, plus extra iron, B vitamins, and vitamin E. Quinoa is also low in fat: the majority of its oil is polyunsaturated, providing essential fatty acids. Quinoa is about as close to a perfect food as you can get.</p>
<p class="indent">Quinoa can be found in many health food stores and used as an alternative to rice. To cook it, rinse well, then add two parts water to one of quinoa and boil for fifteen minutes.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s04"><strong>Meat</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The average person in the U.S. eats over 200 pounds of meat each year. This is 60 pounds above the average annual consumption in the 1950s. The traditional view is that meat is good for you, being high in protein and iron. But the recent BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease”) scare has fueled a growing concern that modern farming methods have gone too far. Meat consumption is going down as more and more people are becoming vegetarian and vegan. Leaving moral considerations aside, there are a number of safety issues that give cause for genuine concern: they include the use of antibiotics, growth hormones, and pesticide dips.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_009_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page57"/><em>Protein quality and quantity</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Described by the microbiologist Professor Richard Lacey as “fake meat,” much of what is for sale in supermarkets and butcher’s shops contains growth hormones, antibiotics, and pesticide residues and, at worst, could be infected with BSE.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s05"><strong>BSE—is it a serious risk?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The infectious agent thought to be responsible for BSE is called a prion. It latches on to proteins in the brain, changing them and thereby triggering disease. It is now proven to pass from species to species and into humans.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of writing over 130 people have died of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in Great Britain, and the leading theory as to the source of vCJD is that it results from eating infected beef. The amount of infected meat that needs to be eaten to get vCJD is unknown, as is the incubation period in humans. Some models have estimated that up to one hundred thousand people may eventually fall victim to vCJD, though increasingly, as time goes by, these estimates are being revised downward, and Dr. James Ironside, a member of the British CJD Surveillance Unit, whose paper was published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 1997, believes that “a total number of cases over the whole course of the disease will be in the hundreds, rather than thousands.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page58"/>With considerable uncertainty persisting about the nature of both BSE and its link to vCJD in humans, it’s worth noting that there has never been a case of BSE in an organically born and reared cow. Organic farmers stopped the unnatural practice of feeding cows to cows long before the BSE epidemic began in the 1980s and are also prohibited from the conventional practice of pouring warble-fly insecticide along the animals’ spines, which is also thought to make cattle more susceptible to BSE. Only time will tell how big a health problem BSE and vCJD will eventually be, and in the meantime the safest option is to eat only organic beef.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s06"><strong>Hormones—a growing problem</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Most meat today, whether chicken, beef, pork, or lamb, has received hormone treatment of one kind or another. Milk, too, is a rich source of hormones, particularly estrogen. Some hormones used widely in the United States are banned in Europe, although there are commercial pressures to rescind the ban. These hormones, including synthetic estradiol and testosterone, are used to force growth rates and increase milk yields. These are the same chemicals that are at the center of the concern about “estrogen dominance,” an increasingly common syndrome found in men and women with hormone-related disease. So far, breast cancer, fibroids, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, prostate and testicular cancer, and endometriosis have all been linked to excessive estrogen levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, it is not easy to find out what long-term effects the introduction of hormones into our food is having. Dr. Malcolm Carruthers, a specialist in male hormone-related disease, investigated one thousand cases of patients exhibiting symptoms of “male menopause” over seven years. The most common symptoms are fatigue, depression, loss of libido, testicular atrophy, impotence, and breast enlargement. Of these one thousand cases, the highest occupational risk group was farmers, the “front-line” troops in the agrochemical arms race.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Carruthers, “For some the causative agent appeared obvious. They had worked on farms caponizing chickens or turkeys with estrogen pellet implants, to make the birds plumper and more tender. Unfortunately, though it might be considered poetic justice, they must have taken in large amounts of estrogen which caused them to become partly caponized themselves.” Farmers less directly exposed to hormones—and to pesticides, which are also known to interfere with male hormone balance—were also at high risk of “male menopause” symptoms.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s06-s01"><a id="page59"/><em>Is your meat bugged?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Antibiotics are in widespread use in both humans and animals. Over five hundred tons are dished out every year in Britain alone. Unlike human medicines, which are given for a limited period for the treatment of an infection, antibiotics are routinely added to animal feed to prevent infection and enhance growth: the aim is higher profits faster. The consumer, however, is being hit with a double whammy.</p>
<p class="indent">Antibiotic residues are frequently found in samples of meat, fish, and eggs. So are infectious agents that have become resistant to antibiotics—superbugs. There is growing concern about a strain of <em>Enterococci faecium</em>, a dangerous bacterium found in chickens that is resistant to vancomycin, one of the strongest “last resort” antibiotics. Fortunately, infection with enterococci is rare compared with salmonella or Campylobacter. With 1,500,000 cases of salmonella and 2,500,000 cases of Campylobacter infection from meat and eggs per year in Britain, it’s potentially a huge problem that these common strains of bacteria causing food poisoning are becoming resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p class="indent">The World Health Organization has called for a reduction in the use of antibiotics in agriculture because of the risk to human health, while the American Medical Association has warned that “The risk to human health from antibiotic resistance developing in micro-organisms is one of the major public health threats that will be faced in the twenty-first century.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts001" id="c08-nts001a"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s06-s02"><em>Too much meat could be bad for your health and your bones</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Meat eaters have a low health rating. The risk of heart disease and cancer, particularly cancer of the stomach and colon, is directly related to meat consumption. So too are other diseases of the digestive system such as diverticulitis, colitis, and appendicitis. Even more likely to result in cardiovascular disease is a high consumption of milk and dairy products. Overall, a meat eater is likely to visit the doctor, or be admitted to the hospital, twice as often as a vegetarian and is likely to suffer from degenerative diseases ten years earlier than a vegetarian, according to a survey by Professors John Dickerson and Jill Davies from the University of Surrey (England).<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts002" id="c08-nts002a"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Most people are in more danger of eating too much protein than too little. Excess protein is a contributor to osteoporosis, overacidity, and many other common health problems. Protein-rich foods—including calcium-packed dairy foods—produce acid when broken down (or metabolized) by your body But we cannot tolerate substantial changes in the pH of blood, so our bodies neutralize or “buffer” this effect through two main alkaline agents—sodium <a id="page60"/>and calcium. When body reserves of sodium are used up, calcium is taken from the bone. Therefore, the more protein you eat, the more calcium you lose.</p>
<p class="indent">The negative effects of too much protein have also been clearly demonstrated in people with osteoporosis. This disease is reaching epidemic proportions—the rate of hip fractures has more than doubled in the last fifty years, even after you take into account the aging population. Yet the traditional risk factors—menopause (when estrogen, the hormone that assists the retention of calcium in bones, ceases to be produced), lack of calcium in the diet, and a couch-potato lifestyle—account for less than half of all hip fractures. This data has been collected by the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, which is the largest research project of its kind to date and has followed nearly ten thousand elderly women since 1986. “Dietary acid load is probably up there at the top of the list of risk factors,” says Uriel Barzel, an endocrinologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, this raises the question as to whether eating a lot of dairy products, high in both protein and calcium, would be protective or contribute to osteoporosis risk. A twelve-year study that involved over 120,000 women throughout the United States found that women who drink two or more glasses of milk per day actually had a 45 percent higher risk of hip fractures and a 5 percent higher risk of forearm fractures than women who drank less. The director of the study, Diane Feskanich, says, “I certainly would want women to have adequate calcium in their diets, but I would not rely on that as the prime prevention against osteoporosis.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts003" id="c08-nts003a"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s07"><strong>Why high-protein, high-fat diets are dangerous</strong></h2>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s07-s01"><em>Kidney problems</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Protein produces breakdown products that are hard work for the kidneys. If your kidneys are healthy and your protein excess isn’t too high, no problem. But, how far can you push it? U.S. researchers tested 1,624 women aged between forty-two and sixty-eight and found that almost one in three had less than ideal kidney function. In the women who had normal kidney function, high protein intakes caused no decline in renal function. However, those who already had a mild kidney problem who ate a high-protein diet, particularly one high in meat protein, showed a further deterioration.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts004" id="c08-nts004a"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> Dairy or vegetable protein was not associated with worsening kidney function. The Atkins diet involves even higher protein intakes than were used in these studies, so you can see the problems it may cause.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s07-s02"><a id="page61"/><em>Bone problems</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Protein is acidic. Too much in the blood has to be neutralized. The Nurses’ Health Study recently found that women who consumed 3.1 oz. (95 g) of protein a day compared with those who consumed less than 2.2 oz. (68 g) a day had a 22 percent greater risk of forearm fractures.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts005" id="c08-nts005a"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">“Consumption of a low-carb/high-protein diet for six weeks delivers a marked acid load to the kidney, increases the risk for stone formation, decreases estimated calcium balance, and may increase the risk for bone loss,” said Dr. Shalini T. Reddy from the University of Chicago, who conducted a six-week study on ten healthy adults on a low-carb diet.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts006" id="c08-nts006a"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a> Volunteers lost an average of 9 pounds (that’s 1.5 pounds a week), but most developed ketones—compounds that are formed when the body uses its own fat as fuel and can raise acid levels in the blood. Acid excretion, a marker of acid levels in the blood, rose by 90 percent in some volunteers. There was also a sharp rise in urinary calcium levels during the diet despite only a slight decrease in calcium intake. Urinary citrate, a compound that inhibits kidney stone formation, decreased. While it is not clear from the study whether bone mass was affected, the findings indicate that such diets may increase the risk of bone loss over the long term.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s07-s03"><em>The meat muscle myth</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Whether you eat steak, in which 52 percent of the calories come from protein, or spinach (the reputed source of Popeye’s strength), in which 49 percent of the calories come from protein, surely you need more to make strong muscles. According to Dr. Michael Colgan, Sylvester Stallone’s former nutritionist and adviser to many U.S. Olympic athletes, this is a myth. He points out that, with hard training, the maximum amount of extra muscle you could build in a year would be less than 8 lb. (3.6 kg). That represents a gain of 2.5 oz. (70 g) a week, or 0.3 oz. (9.5 g) a day. Muscle is only 22 percent protein, so an increased consumption of less than a tenth of an ounce, or 2.8 g a day, equivalent to a quarter of a teaspoonful, is all that is needed to bring about the greatest possible muscle gain! So instead of loading in unnecessary protein, which taxes the body more than it helps it, follow the rules of optimum nutrition to ensure that you make proper use of the protein in your diet.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s08"><strong>Fish</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">While there is no doubt about the immense value of protein and essential fats in fish, fish is contaminated with man-made nonbiodegradable toxins that tend to accumulate up the food chain (from plankton to small fish to bigger <a id="page62"/>fish that eat the small fish, and so on). The same, of course, is true for animals that eat animals that ate pesticide-laden feed. A survey of salmon, published in 2004 in <em>Science</em> magazine, showed that all salmon have some contamination with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxins—industrial pollutants that don’t biodegrade—and with dieldrins and toxaphene, which are pesticides. Fish caught in the Pacific have consistently lower levels than fish caught in the Atlantic. The survey also showed that farmed salmon consistently had higher levels than wild salmon.</p>
<p class="indent">While I generally recommend eating more fish, it’s easy to get confused by recommendations to avoid fish because of contamination with PCBs, dioxins, and other toxic chemicals. In the case of dioxins and PCBs, these contaminants are in the food chain, and both wild fish and farmed fish eat fish or fish feed. Toxaphene, dieldrin, and other pesticide residues are likely to accumulate more from feed fed to farmed fish. You can buy “organic” fish, which are fed less-contaminated feed, though at least half the feed must be of aquatic origin, meaning other fish, which may also be contaminated to some degree with PCBs and dioxins, depending on the sea in which they swim.</p>
<p class="indent">Then there’s the mercury question. All fish contain mercury, and generally the larger the fish, the more the mercury. So, for example, the highest content is found in shark (0.68 mcg per pound), followed by swordfish (0.64), marlin (0.49), and tuna (0.18). Salmon and trout tend to be very low (around 0.02 mcg). Where does the mercury come from, you might wonder. Contrary to popular opinion, most of it isn’t from man-made pollution. Humans have always been exposed to mercury from volcanoes, and there are plenty on the ocean bed. We all consume, on average, 1 mcg of mercury a day from food, water, and air. Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston studied children in the Faeroe Islands, north of Scotland, who eat large amounts of fish and mercury-laden whale meat. At age seven they had a slower transmission of electrical signals along a particular circuit in their brain than normal, and it had worsened further by the age of fourteen.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts007" id="c08-nts007a"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The problem of mercury is substantial only if either you are eating a lot of large, carnivorous fish, or you are already mercury toxic, possibly from a mouthful of amalgam fillings, which can further add to your load. In this case, you should decrease your large-fish consumption and double or triple my recommendations for supplementing zinc and selenium—and consider having your mercury amalgam fillings removed.</p>
<p class="indent">So what’s the bottom line on fish? Given that it’s a great source of protein and essential fats, my advice is to limit large fish such as tuna and swordfish <a id="page63"/>(by eating them only twice a month) and, where possible, eat wild Pacific salmon, followed by wild Atlantic salmon, followed by organic farmed salmon or other, smaller carnivorous fish three times a week. Sardines are an excellent choice—because they’re small they are less likely to have accumulated toxins than other, larger fish.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s09"><strong>Milk</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Milk and other dairy products are the mainstay of the American diet. It is considered an essential source of protein, iron, and calcium. So beneficial is it to our health, according to the National Dairy Council, that you may wonder how we ever existed without it. So why do some authorities not encourage milk drinking if it is such a good source of minerals?</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s09-s01"><em>Ignore the hype</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The truth is that milk is not a very good source of many minerals. Manganese, chromium, selenium, and magnesium are all found in higher levels in fruit and vegetables. Most important is magnesium, which works alongside calcium. The ideal calcium to magnesium ratio is 2:1—you need twice as much calcium as magnesium. Milk’s ratio is 10:1, while cheese is 28:1. Relying on dairy products for calcium is likely to lead to magnesium deficiency and imbalance. Seeds, nuts, and crunchy vegetables like kale, cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower give us both these minerals and others, more in line with our needs. Milk is, after all, designed for young calves, not adult humans.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s09-s02"><em>Not recommended for babies</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Another common myth is that a breast-feeding mother needs to drink milk in order to make milk. This, of course, is nonsense. The move away from breast-feeding led to the substitution of human milk with cow’s milk. Cow’s milk is designed for calves, and is very different from human milk in a number of respects, including its protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and essential fatty acid content. Early feeding of human babies on cow’s milk is now known to increase the likelihood of developing a cow’s milk allergy, which affects close to one in ten babies. Common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, persistent colic, eczema, hives, catarrh, bronchitis, asthma, and sleeplessness. The American Society of Microbiologists has suggested that some crib deaths may be attributable to cow’s milk allergy. Cow’s milk should not be given to infants under four months.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page64"/>Conversely, breast milk is nothing but good news. A breast-fed baby has, on average, a four point higher IQ.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts008" id="c08-nts008a"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> This advantage can be doubled by giving the pregnant and breast-feeding mother a supplement of omega-3 fish oils.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s09-s03"><em>Milk, heart disease, and breast and prostate cancer</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Milk consumption is strongly linked with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and also breast and prostate cancer. The higher a country’s intake of milk, the higher its incidence of cardiovascular disease.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts009" id="c08-nts009a"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> Why is this? Well, contrary to popular opinion, it may not be because of the fat content in milk. A candidate for why milk increases heart disease is its poor calcium to magnesium ratio—more than any other mineral, magnesium protects against heart disease. Another candidate is the discovery of a link between heart disease risk and the presence of an antimilk antibody in the blood. Our bodies actually produce an antibody against milk, which certainly suggests it isn’t an ideal food. On top of that, 70 percent of people stop producing lactase, the enzyme to digest milk sugar, once they’ve been weaned. Is nature trying to tell us something?</p>
<p class="indent">Even more insidious than the link to heart disease is new research suggesting that dairy consumption may be the main reason that people in the West have a massive risk of breast and prostate cancer, while Asians don’t. The figures for the chances of women in China dying from breast cancer are one in ten thousand, as opposed to close to one in thirty-three for the U.S. For prostate cancer, the difference is even greater. In rural China, the incidence is 0.5 in one hundred thousand, yet it is estimated that, by 2015, one in six men in the U.S. will have a diagnosis of prostate cancer at some point in their lives. Why is a disease that is virtually nonexistent in China ruining and often prematurely ending the lives of so many men in Britain? Is it genes, diet, or environment? It is obviously not genetics since Chinese men emigrating to Europe soon end up with similar risk. Is China more rural, with less urban pollution? This too is unlikely to be the main reason, although it may be part of the problem. In highly urbanized Hong Kong, the rate of breast cancer rises to one in every three hundred women, but that’s still along way off one in ten in the West. So, is it diet and, if so, what is it about our Western diet and lifestyle that is tipping us toward breast and prostate cancer?</p>
<p class="indent">If you asked me to take an educated guess, I’d put my money on hormone-disrupting chemicals, both because of the evidence that’s emerging and because of the logic. Prostate and breast cells are stimulated to grow by hormonal messages. Ask oncologists and they’ll tell you that these hormone-sensitive cells go into overgrowth when exposed to too much estrogen or <a id="page65"/>estrogen-like chemicals. The late Dr. John Lee argued eloquently in favor of “estrogen dominance” being a primary cause of breast cancer. He explained in his excellent book, <em>What Your Doctor May Not Tell You about Breast Cancer</em>, that estrogen is the hormone that makes things grow and that progesterone keeps cells healthy. Too much of the former and not enough of the latter could tip the scales to abnormal cell growth. Too much stress and sugar, leading to insulin resistance, along with exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals (from DDT, dioxins, and PCB to estrogen and synthetic-progestin HRT) could swing the balance, but there’s another growth promoter. It’s called insulin-like growth factor (IGF). There are different types—IGF-1, IGF-2, and so on, although much of the focus is on IGF-1.</p>
<p class="indent">Milk is rich in IGF-1. Modern milk is doubly abundant in it, partly because cows have been selectively reared to produce milk during pregnancy. This milk is especially rich in estrogen. On top of that, in the United States cows are treated with bovine growth hormone (BGH), which is a growth hormone capable of further increasing milk yield by about 12 percent. All this means a cow’s daily milk production has gone from three to thirty quarts. Not surprisingly, this milk has two to five times the amount of IGF-1, while the beef from a BGH-treated animal has about double the IGF. Casein, the protein in milk, helps carry the IGF into us.</p>
<p class="indent">Our bodies do make IGF, but produce very little in adulthood. It’s produced mainly in childhood to stimulate growth. When levels in the blood increase by 8 percent, risk for prostate cancer increases seven times. Levels of IGF are, on average, 9 percent higher in meat-eating omnivores and dairy-eating vegetarians than in vegans. Recent research from Shanghai, China, has found that the higher a woman’s IGF-1 levels, the higher her risk for breast cancer. This study found that women in the top 25 percent of IGF-1 scores had two to three times the risk of women in the bottom 25 percent of IGF-1 levels.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts010" id="c08-nts010a"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> A study from York University in England on the link between IGF and prostate cancer risk in men found a similar result. Men in the top 25 percent of IGF levels had three times the risk of prostate cancer.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts011" id="c08-nts011a"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a> These are just two of a dozen trials finding a strong link between circulating levels of IGF-1 and cancer. There are just as many showing a direct correlation between dairy consumption and breast and prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p class="indent">What does IGF-1 do, and why is it a strong candidate for increasing risk of cancer? Normally, it is produced by the liver, especially during puberty. In girls, it stimulates the growth of breast tissue, encouraging cells to divide and grow. In boys, it stimulates growth of the prostate. There’s nothing wrong with IGF-1. It’s a perfectly normal hormone. It’s just that we aren’t designed to be eating sources of it in adulthood.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page66"/>In countries such as the United States, where cows are treated with BGH, milk from these cows develops raised levels of IGF-1, found in both the cow and those who drink the milk. This growth factor makes estrogen more potent in the body, and research is increasingly showing that it could increase the risk of breast and colon cancer. University of Illinois toxicologist Dr. Samuel Epstein says that “all women from conception to death will now be exposed to an additional breast-cancer risk due to milk from cows treated with BGH.”</p>
<p class="indent">While milk naturally contains small amounts of estrogen, changes in farming practices now make it possible to milk cows continuously, even while they are pregnant. These pregnant cows produce milk with much higher levels of estrogen. If you drink milk, my advice is to stick to organic milk, which disallows this practice and the use of BGH. On top of that, cows eating pesticide- or herbicide-sprayed feed tend to accumulate residues in their meat and fat. For a consumer of meat or milk products, choosing the organic rather than nonorganic varieties reduces the risk of exposure to pesticide and herbicide residues as well as BGH.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s09-s04"><em>Allergy and its effects</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Milk allergy or intolerance is very common among both children and adults. Sometimes this is the result of lactose intolerance, since many adults lose the ability to digest lactose (milk sugar). The symptoms are bloating, abdominal pain, gas, and diarrhea, which subside on giving lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. Probably equally common is an allergy to dairy products. The most common symptoms are a blocked nose and excessive mucus production, respiratory complaints such as asthma, and gastrointestinal problems. These are inflammatory reactions produced by the body when it doesn’t like what you’re eating. Such intolerances are most likely to occur in people who consume dairy products regularly in large quantities. Few people who are allergic to milk can tolerate yogurt. Some can tolerate goat’s milk or sheep’s milk. Most can’t.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s09-s05"><em>Milk and infant-onset diabetes</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Growing evidence is linking child-onset diabetes to allergy to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in dairy products.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c08-nts012" id="c08-nts012a"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a> This type of diabetes, which tends to strike in the early teenage years, starts with the immune system destroying the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Why this occurs has long been a mystery.</p>
<p class="extract"><a id="page67"/>While there is a genetic predisposition to insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD), this is only part of the picture. Genetically susceptible children who had been breast-fed for at least seven months or exclusively breast-fed for at least three or four months were found to have a significantly decreased incidence of IDD, which suggested another factor. Children who have not been given cow’s milk until they are four months or older also show the same substantially reduced risk. The highest incidence of IDD is found in Finland, which has the world’s highest consumption of milk products.</p>
<p class="indent">Animal studies showed that rats bred to be susceptible to diabetes had a much higher risk of contracting the disease if their feed contained either milk or wheat gluten. In one study, even the addition of 1 percent skimmed milk to their diet increased the incidence of IDD from 15 percent to 52 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1993, Dr. Hans-Michael Dosch, professor of immunology at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, identified BSA as the specific factor in dairy products that increased the risk of diabetes and showed that it cross-reacted with the cells of the pancreas. He and his fellow researchers theorized that diabetes-susceptible babies introduced to BSA earlier than around four months, before which age the gut wall is immature and more permeable, would develop an allergic response to BSA. As a result, their immune cells would mistakenly destroy not only the BSA molecules but also pancreatic tissue. He went on to show that, of 142 newly diagnosed IDD children, 100 percent had antibodies to BSA, compared with 2 percent in unaffected children. Dr. Dosch believes that the presence of these anti-BSA antibodies indicated future child-onset diabetes in 80 to 90 percent of cases.</p>
<p class="indent">He believes that keeping children off dairy products for at least their first six months halves the risk. BSA can, however, pass from the mother’s diet into her milk. So if breast-feeding mothers avoid beef and dairy products, the risk can be completely removed in genetically susceptible children. The current opinion is that about one in four children is genetically susceptible. Avoiding milk may also have benefits for a child’s mental development. The vast majority of autistic children and many who suffer from hyperactivity prove allergic to milk.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s10"><strong>Milk and meat—the verdict</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">From the current evidence, given the present state of intensive farming, neither meat (particularly beef) nor milk (especially for young children) should be staple foods if you really want to pursue optimum nutrition. But this is no loss—not only is it possible to have a healthy diet without including dairy <a id="page68"/>products and meat, it’s also almost certainly going to decrease your risk of the common killer diseases. For meat lovers who feel they do not want to go vegetarian, I recommend avoiding beef and eating meat no more than three times a week, substituting more fresh vegetables and whole foods such as beans, lentils, and whole grains and choosing only organic meats and free-range chicken or fish. For milk, substitute soy or rice milk or buy organic milk. If you suspect you might be allergic, stay off all dairy products for fourteen days. If it makes no difference, limit your intake of milk to one quart a week.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>Some general guidelines for your protein intake</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Eat two servings of beans, lentils, quinoa, tofu (soy), “seed” vegetables, or other vegetable protein; or one small serving of meat, fish, or cheese; or a free-range egg, every day.</li>
<li>Reduce your intake of dairy products and avoid them altogether if you are allergic, substituting soy or rice milk.</li>
<li>Reduce other sources of animal protein, choosing lean meat or fish and eating no more than three servings a week.</li>
<li>Eat organic whenever possible to avoid possible contamination with hormones and antibiotics.</li>
</ul>
