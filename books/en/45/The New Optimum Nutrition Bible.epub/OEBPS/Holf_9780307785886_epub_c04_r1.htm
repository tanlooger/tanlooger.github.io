<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>You Are Unique</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There is nobody quite like you. There are many principles that apply to us all as members of the human race—for example, we all need vitamins; but the actual amount we need for peak performance varies from individual to individual. It depends on the evolutionary dynamics that you have inherited from your parents, together with genetically inherited strengths and weaknesses, and the interaction of your genetics with your environment right through fetal development and early infancy. The complex interaction of these factors ensures that each individual is born biochemically unique, although clearly similar to other individuals.</p>
<p class="indent">This principle, called biochemical individuality, was first succinctly proposed by Dr. Roger Williams in 1956. Dr. Williams also discovered vitamin B<sub class="frac">5</sub> (pantothenic acid) and helped isolate folic acid. He was one of the grandfathers of optimum nutrition. True to form, he was actively teaching, writing, and researching into his nineties. In his book <em>Biochemical Individuality</em>, he showed how in each one of us our organs are different shapes and sizes and how we have different levels of enzymes and different needs for protein, vitamins, and minerals. A tenfold difference in the requirement for vitamins from one person to the next is not at all uncommon. For example, a comparison of the level of vitamin A in the blood of ninety-two individuals, most of whom were on a very similar diet, found a thirtyfold difference. Repeated testing revealed that individuals’ blood level of vitamin A stayed remarkably consistent, although the levels from individual to individual varied considerably.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c04-nts011" id="c04-nts011a"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a> This suggests a wide range of need for vitamin A—a fact ignored by today’s recommended daily allowances (RDAs).</p>
<p class="indent">Some of us have difficulty digesting protein or fat or need more of a particular vitamin than the average diet can supply. This is well illustrated by the <a id="page24"/>vitamin-deficiency disease pellagra, whose symptoms include mental illness, sometimes accompanied by digestive and skin problems. For most people, a mere 10 mg a day of vitamin B<sub class="frac">3</sub> (niacin) will prevent pellagra. That is the amount you would find in a serving of rice or a handful of peanuts. Yet Dr. Abram Hoffer, psychiatric research director for the province of Saskatchewan in Canada, found that many patients diagnosed with schizophrenia got better and stayed better only when given 1,000 mg or more a day.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c04-nts012" id="c04-nts012a"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a> These people needed a hundred times more than the average level to stay healthy.</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, this kind of information makes a mockery of RDAs, nicknamed “ridiculous dietary arbitraries” by Dr. Stephen Davies, a leading nutrition researcher in London. How do you know if these government-set averages, which vary from country to country, are the right amounts for you? I guarantee they are not.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c04-s01"><strong>From the cradle to the grave</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">What happens during pregnancy and early childhood has a profound effect on health in later life. In fact, the risk of cardiovascular disease increases substantially for those whose birth weight was low, according to research by Professor David Barker at the Medical Research Council Environmental Epidemiology Unit in Southampton, England.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c04-nts013" id="c04-nts013a"><sup class="frac">13</sup></a> Professor Derek Bryce-Smith from the University of Reading in the UK found that, simply by analyzing the level of lead, cadmium, and zinc in placental tissue, he could predict with remarkable accuracy the birth weight and head circumference of a newborn baby.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c04-nts014" id="c04-nts014a"><sup class="frac">14</sup></a> That means that if your mother was exposed to exhaust fumes containing lead, or to cigarette smoke that contains cadmium, or was zinc-deficient, it will have taken its toll on you. Professor Bryce-Smith concluded from his research that any child born below a weight of 6.9 lb. should be investigated for suboptimum nutrition.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c04-s02"><strong>One man’s food …</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">According to the UK’s Royal College of Physicians, one in three people suffer from allergies at some point in their lives, with foods being the most common provokers of allergic symptoms. As Lucretius said in 50 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, “One man’s food is another man’s poison.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the symptoms do not occur immediately after eating an offending food, but creep up on you over a twenty-four-hour period, so it is easy to live for years without knowing that a particular food does not suit you. What is <a id="page25"/>more, many people may never have felt truly healthy, so do not even know that how they feel is under par.</p>
<p class="indent">These are just a few examples that illustrate how each person’s optimum nutrition is likely to be slightly different from anyone else’s. This book will give you the opportunity to investigate the major lifestyle factors that shape your nutritional needs and to assess your personal nutritional needs on the basis of your symptoms, not according to some arbitrary general guideline. From then on, it is a matter of educated trial and error and noticing which foods make you feel good and which ones take your energy away.</p>

<p class="center2"><strong>A few simple tips<br/>to help you work with your biochemical individuality</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Notice after which meals you feel worse. Look for the common foods, eliminate for two weeks, then see how you feel.</li>
<li>Just because others can tolerate a certain food does not mean you can.</li>
<li>Assess your own nutritional needs (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p06_r1.htm">part 6</a>) and supplement the recommended nutrients until you are feeling healthy, full of energy, and symptom free.</li>
