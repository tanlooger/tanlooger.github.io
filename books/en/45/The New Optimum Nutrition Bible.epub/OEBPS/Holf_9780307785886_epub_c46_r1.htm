<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Everything You Need to</strong> <strong>Know about Supplements</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Not all supplements are the same. Analysis of a wide variety of multivitamin tablets to find out how much it would cost to get the basic optimum vitamin requirements produced a range between twenty cents and over eight dollars a day! And with so many supplements available, all promising perfect health, it is easy to get confused. For instance, if you are looking for a simple multivitamin preparation to meet the basic optimum requirements, you have at least twenty products to choose from. This chapter explains what to look for in a good supplement.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c46-s01"><strong>Reading the label</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Labeling laws vary from country to country, but many of the principles are the same. However, since the laws keep changing, many manufacturers are as confused as the public. Below is a typical label with advice on how to interpret the small print.</p>
<p class="indent">On this label, the dosages are easy to understand, the chemical names for the different vitamins are given, and the fillers (for example, calcium phosphate) are listed. Directions for when and how to take the tablets are given. These are the things to go for when you are buying supplements: do not be misled by an attractive-looking label or a very cheap price, but do not pay too much either!</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, however, not all supplements are true to their labels, so it is not always best to buy the cheapest. Reputable vitamin companies should give you a list of all the ingredients on the label.</p>

<p class="nonindent">For most supplements, the ingredients have to be listed in order of weight, starting with the ingredient present in the greatest quantity. This is often confusing, since included in this list are the nonnutrient additives needed to make the tablet. Often the chemical name of the nutrient is used instead of the common vitamin code (for example, ergocalciferol for vitamin D).</p>

<p class="indent">When you have identified which nutrient is which, look at the amount provided by each daily dose. Some supplements state this in terms of two tablets (“Each two tablets provide …,” since the supplement is designed to be taken twice a day. The amount supplied will be given in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (mcg or µg). Most countries have now switched to “µg” as the symbol for micrograms, which are thousandths of a milligram.</p>
<p class="indent">Vitamin A measurements are a little tricky. This is because beta-carotene is not actually vitamin A but can be turned into vitamin A by the body. So, to indicate the equivalent effect of a certain amount of beta-carotene compared with vitamin A (retinol). So, to indicate the equivalent effect of a certain amount of beta carotene compared with vitamin A (retinol) beta-carotene is reported in IUs. This means that 10 IU of beta-carotene has more or less the same antioxidant effect of 10 IU of vitamin A. Not everybody converts beta-carotene to vitamin A with the same efficiency. Also, beta-carotene does not have the associated toxicity in excess. Therefore, it’s best to both eat and supplement <a id="page407"/>both. To work out your total equivalent vitamin A from supplements add up both the IU for vitamin A and beta-carotene in your supplements.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c46-s03"><strong>Elemental minerals</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Minerals in multivitamin and mineral tablets often omit the “elemental” value of the compound, stating only the amount of the mineral compound. For instance, 100 mg of zinc amino acid chelate will provide only 10 mg of zinc and 90 mg of the amino acid to which it is chelated (attached). What you want to know is the amount of the actual mineral, in this example 10 mg. This is called the “elemental value.” Most reputable manufacturers make your life easy by stating something like “zinc amino acid chelate (providing 5 mg zinc) 50 mg” or “zinc (as amino acid chelate) 5 mg,” both of which mean you are getting 5 mg of elemental or actual zinc. Otherwise, you may have to contact the manufacturer for more detailed information. Most good companies declare this information either on the label or in literature that comes with the product.</p>
<p class="indent">Supplement labels are also required to show the percentage of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) that is met by the product. But for the purposes of achieving optimum nutrition, this is largely irrelevant, since the amounts needed are often many times higher than the RDA.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c46-s04"><strong>Fillers, binders, lubricants, and coatings</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Supplements often contain other ingredients that are necessary in their manufacture. While capsules do not really need to have anything added, tablets usually do to enable the ingredients to stick together to form a tablet. Tablets start off as powders, and to get the bulk right “fillers” are added. “Binders” are added to give the mixture the right consistency, and lubricants are also used. Only when this is done can the mixture be turned into small, uneven granules, which are then pressed into tablets under considerable force. Granulating allows the mixture to lock together, forming a solid mass. The tablet may then be covered with a “protein coating” to protect it from deterioration and make it easier to swallow.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, many tablets also have artificial coloring and flavoring added, as well as a sugar coating. For instance, many vitamin C tablets are colored orange and made to taste sweet, since we associate vitamin C with oranges! Vitamin C is naturally almost white and certainly is not sweet—nor should your supplement be. As a rule of thumb, buy only supplements that declare their fillers and binders (sometimes also called “excipients”). <a id="page408"/>Companies with integrity are usually only too happy to display this information. The following fillers and binders are perfectly acceptable, and some even add further nutritious properties to the tablet:</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Dicalcium phosphate</strong>. A natural filler providing calcium and phosphate.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Cellulose</strong>. A natural binder consisting of plant fiber.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Alginic acid/sodium alginate</strong>. A natural binder from seaweed.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Gum acacia/gum arabic</strong>. A natural vegetable gum.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Calcium stearate or magnesium stearate</strong>. A natural lubricant (usually from animal source).</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Silica</strong>. A natural lubricant.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Zein</strong>. A corn protein for coating the tablet.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Brazil wax</strong>. A natural coating derived from palm trees.</p>
<p class="extract">Stearate, which is the chemical name for saturated fat, is used as a lubricant. The cheapest comes from animal sources, although nonanimal stearates are available. If you are a strict vegan or vegetarian, you may want to check this with the supplement company. If a product is labeled “suitable for vegans,” it cannot legally contain any ingredients sourced from animals.</p>
<p class="indent">Most large tablets are coated. This makes them shiny, smooth, and easier to swallow. It is not so necessary with small tablets. If a tablet is chalky or rough on the outside, it is not coated. Coating, depending on the substance used, can also protect the ingredients, increasing their shelf life. Avoid sugar-coated, artificially colored supplements. Natural colors, for example, from berry extracts, are fine.</p>
<p class="indent">Very occasionally a manufacturer overcoats a batch of tablets and, particularly in people with a shortage of stomach acid, this can inhibit the tablet’s disintegration. Most reliable companies check the disintegration time of each batch to rule out this possibility, so it is a rare problem.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c46-s05"><strong>Free from sugar, gluten, animal products, and so on</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Many of the better supplements will declare that the product is free from sugar and gluten. If you are allergic to milk or yeast, do check that the tablets are also free from lactose (milk sugar) and yeast. B vitamins can be derived from yeast, so you need to be careful. If in doubt, contact the company and <a id="page409"/>ask for an independent “assay” of the ingredients: good companies will supply this information.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes glucose, fructose, or dextrose is used to sweeten a tablet and yet the packaging still declares “no sugar.” These products are best avoided. A small amount of fructose is the least evil if you are having difficulty enticing a child to take vitamins. Any other preservatives or flavoring agents should be avoided unless they are natural. Pineapple essence, for instance, is a natural additive.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are vegan or vegetarian, choose supplements that state they are suitable for vegans or vegetarians. Retinol (vitamin A) can be derived from an animal source, synthesized, or derived from a vegetable source such as retinyl palmitate. Vitamin D can be synthesized, or derived from sheep’s wool or from a vegetable source. Companies do not have to state the source of the nutrients, just their chemical form.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c46-s06"><strong>Advisory statements</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Some supplements are required by law to carry “advisory notices.” In my view, these cautions are, in most cases, exceedingly overcautious. For example, vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub> supplements containing above 10 mg have to say that “long-term intakes may lead to mild tingling and numbness.” I know of not one single case where this has actually happened, although it will happen at higher doses, above 500 mg. If you are particularly concerned by such warnings on labels, read <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c49_r1.htm">chapter 49</a>, which gives you a realistic upper limit for nutrients, based on the latest science.</p>
