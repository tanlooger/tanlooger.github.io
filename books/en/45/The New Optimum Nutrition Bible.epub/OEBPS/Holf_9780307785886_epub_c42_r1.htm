<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Preventing the Problems</strong> <strong>of Old Age</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">The best way to stay healthy in old age is to prevent disease before it starts. Many animals, after all, stay healthy throughout their lives. In the Western world, it is barely even legal to die of old age: most death certificates require a cause, a disease. I firmly believe that it is possible to lead an active life without years of poor health and unnecessary suffering. Certainly three of the “grandfathers” of optimum nutrition, Linus Pauling, Roger Williams, and Carl Pfeiffer, all lived to a ripe old age.</p>
<p class="indent">The trick, of course, is to prevent heart disease and cancer by following the advice in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c23_r1.htm">chapters 23</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c32_r1.htm">32</a>. Both Pauling and Pfeiffer were convinced that, through optimum nutrition, you could add at least ten years of healthy living. Williams said, “Well-rounded nutrition, including generous amounts of vitamins C and E, can contribute materially to extending life span of those who are already middle-aged. The greatest hope of increasing life span can be offered if nutrition—from the time of prenatal development to old age—is continuously of the highest quality.” Pfeiffer took 10 grams of vitamin C a day toward the end of his life, while Pauling took 16 grams. There is certainly a good case for taking a gram of vitamin C (1,000 mg) and 112 IU of <a id="page374"/>vitamin E for every decade of life. So an eighty-year-old may benefit most from 8 grams of vitamin C and 900 IU of vitamin E.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c42-s01"><strong>Improving digestion and absorption</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The production of stomach acid and enzymes often declines with age. Stomach acid production depends on zinc, so it is important to ensure that your zinc intake is adequate. A lack of zinc also reduces people’s sense of taste and smell, leading to a liking for salt, sauces, and strong-tasting food like cheese and meat. Zinc-deficient people often go off fruit and vegetables. Improving zinc nutrition, rather than overcooking vegetables and adding lots of strongly flavored sauces, can improve your health considerably, including relieving constipation.</p>
<p class="indent">The lack of stomach acid and enzymes also leads to poor absorption of nutrients from food into the body. If you have digestive problems or are sixty-plus, to assist nutrient absorption it is worth trying a digestive enzyme supplement containing a small amount of betaine hydrochloride (stomach acid). Betaine is another name for trimethylglycine (TMG), which lowers homocysteine (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c16_r1.htm">chapter 16</a>). This can improve the absorption of both vitamin and minerals.</p>
<p class="indent">Studies on the elderly clearly demonstrate that key nutrients such as vitamins B<sub class="frac">12</sub> and folic acid are poorly absorbed. For example, while the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub> is a measly 6 mcg and the average dietary intake is more like 6 mcg, a recent study found that 10 mcg of B<sub class="frac">12</sub> is ineffective in restoring B<sub class="frac">12</sub> status in those with low or borderline serum B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, a hallmark of the elderly, while 50 mcg per day is effective in both restoring B<sub class="frac">12</sub> status and lowering homocysteine levels.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c42-nts018" id="c42-nts018a"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a> It is also worth paying a little extra for the most easily absorbed mineral formulas (see <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c48_r1.htm">chapter 48</a>).</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c42-s02"><strong>Combating arthritis, aches, and pains</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">One of the greatest causes of suffering in old age is aching joints and arthritis. One is often led to believe there is nothing that can be done except to take painkillers (which more often than not speed up the progression of the disease). This is completely untrue. There are many proven ways to reduce pain and inflammation without drugs, outlined in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c26_r1.htm">chapter 26</a> and discussed fully in my book <em>Say No to Arthritis</em>, even when degeneration is severe.</p>
<p class="indent">Fred is a case in point. He had seen many specialists and tried all the conventional treatments. Then he tried the optimum nutrition approach. “I used <a id="page375"/>to have constant pain in my knees and joints, could not play golf or walk more than ten minutes without resting my legs. Since following Patrick’s advice, my discomfort has decreased 95 to 100 percent. It is a different life when you can travel and play golf every day. I never would have believed my pain could be reduced by such a large degree, and not return no matter how much activity in a day or week.” Key strategies for reducing pain and inflammation are:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Identify and avoid allergens.</li>
<li>Supplement niacin (up to 500 mg a day) and pantothenic acid (500 mg a day).</li>
<li>Supplement antioxidants.</li>
<li>Supplement anti-inflammatory herbs and nutrients such as omega-3 fats and boswellia.</li>
<li>Supplement bone-building nutrients, including minerals and glucosamine.</li>
<li>Good, all-round optimum nutrition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Sometimes aches and pains occur in the muscles and not the joints. This is not arthritis and may be due to one of two conditions. The first is fibromyalgia, which is characterized by a number of tender points in specific muscles. This is now thought to be due to a problem in the energy metabolism of the muscle cells and not to inflammation. Anti-inflammatory agents may therefore not help, although painkillers can suppress the symptoms. A particular form of magnesium, magnesium malate, is proving very effective at relieving fibromyalgia, together with a supportive diet plus supplements. Stress, which uses up magnesium, makes this condition worse. Polymyalgia, characterized by early morning stiffness, often in the shoulders and hips, is more often brought on when the body’s detoxification systems are overloaded. This means that the liver, kidneys, brain, and all the cells, including muscle cells, cannot deal with the garbage produced by digestion and daily living. Different systems of the body can be affected.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people experience chronic fatigue, others bodily aches as in polymyalgia. Yet others find that their nervous system is affected, bringing on premature senility or multiple sclerosis-type symptoms, or else the immune system starts misbehaving, resulting in infections, allergies, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Polymyalgia, being an inflammatory condition, usually responds to antioxidant supplementation and liver detoxification. The conventional treatment is the drug prednisolone.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_068_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page376"/><strong><em>The drug dilemma</em></strong>. <em>Many conventional medical drugs (such as painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs) suppress the body’s normal responses to underlying contributors. They act like toxins in the body and can contribute to decline in health and/or dependence. Then you need another drug to counteract the symptoms! It’s a downward spiral</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c42-s03"><a id="page377"/><strong>Avoiding the drug cycle</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Most people in this scenario end up on the drug cycle, perhaps starting with painkillers or steroids, then moving on to antibiotics when infections set in. The drugs treat the symptom but not the cause—in fact they usually aggravate the cause by irritating the gut and making the intestinal wall more leaky, which is what nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics do. This means that more garbage gets into the body, further overloading detoxification pathways. Many drugs, such as acetaminophen, are toxins in their own right and severely tax the liver. The result is ever-increasing overload on body systems, leading to more serious diseases and infections.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c42-s04"><strong>Preventing dementia and Alzheimer’s</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">It is very likely that age-related memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease are the net consequences of inflammation and overstretching the body’s ability to detoxify. This is good news because it means that Alzheimer’s disease should be preventable and possibly even reversible in the early stages.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c42-nts019" id="c42-nts019a"><sup class="frac">19</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Alzheimer’s disease and dementia have similar causes and associated risk factors to other common degenerative disease, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, both of which are largely preventable by optimum nutrition. The central mechanism for degeneration of brain cells is inflammation and oxidation. Increased intake of antioxidant vitamins E and C, and omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, reduces risk. Lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol and homocysteine levels, the latter by improving folate and vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub> and B6 intake, also decreases risk. Reducing excessive exposure to aluminum, mercury, and copper, which exacerbate oxidation, may also reduce risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Once brain-cell degeneration occurs, levels of the brain’s memory molecule, acetylcholine, start to decline. In addition, there is growing evidence that precursor nutrients phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl serine, and DMAE may also improve cognitive function, possibly by helping brain-cell generation or by helping to make more acetylcholine.</p>
<p class="indent">A combined dietary and lifestyle approach, together with nutrient supplementation, offers an effective strategy for prevention and early-stage reversal of age-related cognitive decline. If you’d like to know more about this approach, read my book</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_069_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page378"/><em>How toxicity occurs and detoxify the body</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c42-s05"><a id="page379"/><strong>Treat the cause and not the symptom</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The way out is to treat the cause and not the symptom, as well as ensure optimum brain nutrition including the smart nutrients discussed in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c28_r1.htm">chapter 28</a>, which help maximize memory.</p>
<p class="indent">A combination of poor diet, alcohol, drugs, and infections often leads to problems in later life. Thanks to recent biochemical advances, simple urine tests can now reveal whether the sensitive balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut has been disrupted (known as dysbiosis), to what extent the gut wall has become permeable (this is a primary underlying cause of toxic overload), and exactly which pathways in the liver are overloaded. Each pathway depends on a sequence of enzymes, themselves dependent on nutrients. A nutrition consultant can devise a specific diet and supplement program using specific vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids designed to decrease the toxic load on the body and restore the body’s detoxification potential. The results are often spectacular.</p>
<p class="indent">This is especially important since it is often decreased liver detoxification potential, exacerbated by poor nutrient status and exposure to oxidants and other antinutrients, that leads to the system failure called death.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that fully healthy humans, like the salmon, should have enough reserves to make it to the end of their lives without a debilitating loss of either mental or physical function and to experience finally a fairly rapid and painless system shutdown. What happens next is the ultimate adventure. I am intrigued about the growing evidence suggesting that the pineal gland releases a neurotransmitter-like substance, dimethyltryptamine, that, if injected, often produces profound experiences that exactly parallel the now thousands of well-reported near-death experiences.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c42-nts020" id="c42-nts020a"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a> However, discussing whether or not there is life after death is not the purpose of this book. Here, I am more concerned with whether or not there is life before death!</p>
