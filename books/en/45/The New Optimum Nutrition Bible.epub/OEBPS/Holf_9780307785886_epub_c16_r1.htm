<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Homocysteine—Your Most</strong> <strong>Important Health Statistic</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Forget your blood pressure, your cholesterol, even your weight. There is one factor that can determine better than any other whether you will live long and healthy or die young. It’s called homocysteine.</p>
<p class="indent">Homocysteine is a type of protein, produced by the body and found in the blood, which ideally should be present in very low quantities. However, if you are not optimally nourished, homocysteine can accumulate in the blood, increasing the risk for over fifty diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, certain cancers, diabetes, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. Between 5 percent and 10 percent of the general population and maybe as high as 30 percent to 40 percent of the elderly in the U.S. has a high homocysteine level. The good news is that this new and important risk factor can be reversed in weeks.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c16-s01"><strong>What is homocysteine?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Homocysteine is produced from the amino acid methionine, which is found in normal dietary protein. Homocysteine in itself isn’t bad news—your body naturally turns it into one of two beneficial substances. These are called glutathione (the body’s most important antioxidant) and a methyl donor called SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine; a very important type of “intelligent” nutrient for both brain and body).</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble is, if you don’t have optimal amounts of B vitamins in your diet, the enzymes that turn homocysteine into these beneficial substances don’t work well enough. Your homocysteine can’t be converted, so your level of it rises dangerously (see figure on the next page).</p>
<p class="indent">To make matters more complex, it has been discovered that one in ten people has an inherited genetic mutation that makes them more prone to a higher homocysteine level than other people. This means that the enzyme that <a id="page138"/>converts homocysteine into SAMe (it’s called the MTHFR enzyme) doesn’t work so well. Luckily, studies show that larger daily intakes of B<sub class="frac">12</sub> and folic acid can help make the deficient enzyme work better.</p>
<p class="indent">While the importance of antioxidants is now well established, the new buzzword in medicine is “methylation.” The ability of the body to maintain chemical balance hinges upon its ability to add or subtract molecules called methyl groups. This is how the body turns one thing into another. To make this real, let’s say all this talk of “premature death” is stressing you out. Your body responds by adding a methyl group to noradrenaline to produce adrenaline. On hearing that homocysteine is rapidly reversible you relax. The body responds by removing a methyl group from adrenaline, turning it into noradrenaline. This kind of chemical reaction occurs a billion times every second, keeping everything in balance.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_031_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><strong><em>The homocysteine pathway</em></strong>. <em>We all make homocysteine from eating protein. Normally, it is quickly turned into SAMe or glutathione, two very essential and health-promoting substances in the body. But if you lack enough of certain nutrients such as B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, folate, zinc, or TMG (trimethyl glycine), you end up accumulating toxic homocysteine</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page139"/>If there were one measure of your antioxidant “IQ,” it would be the level of glutathione inside your cells. All those antoxidants you eat and supplement every day have the greatest effect if they ultimately raise this level of intracellular glutathione. Similarly, if there were one measure of your methyl “IQ,” it would be the level of SAMe inside your cells. This is because SAMe can easily donate a methyl group or accept one back, keeping the body’s biochemistry flexible. Normally, both SAMe and glutathione are made from the amino acid methionine in our diet, via homocysteine. However, if the conversion of homocysteine is blocked in any way, the homocysteine level goes up and SAMe and glutathione levels go down.</p>
<p class="indent">This is only half the bad news. The other half is the discovery that homocysteine damages your arteries, brain, and DNA itself. That’s why your homocysteine level is theoretically the most important indicator of the health and adaptability of your body’s total biochemistry and your risk of degenerative diseases. But where’s the hard proof?</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c16-s01-s01"><em>Reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes by 75 percent</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The largest review of ninety-two studies, by David Wald and colleagues from the Department of Cardiology at Southampton General Hospital (England), recently published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, examined the association between homocysteine and risk for cardiovascular disease in twenty thousand people.</p>
<p class="indent">They found that, with every 5-unit (millimole/liter) increase in homocysteine measured in the blood, the risk for heart disease went up by 42 percent in those with the MTHFR gene mutation and by 32 percent in those without it. The risk for strokes went up by 65 percent in those with the genetic mutation and by 59 percent in those without it. The researchers concluded that these “highly significant results indicate strong evidence that the association between homocysteine and cardiovascular disease is causal.”<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts056" id="c16-nts056a"><sup class="frac">56</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">This means that having a high homocysteine level isn’t just associated with higher risk, it actually causes heart disease—a conclusion that is also being reached by other research groups.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts057" id="c16-nts057a"><sup class="frac">57</sup></a> If, therefore, you can lower your homocysteine level (your H score), you remove the cause, and hence the risk.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page140"/>While the average homocysteine level is around 10 units, an ideal level is below 6 units. Those with a history of cardiovascular disease often have a level above 15 units. According to this study, lowering a high homocysteine from 16 to 6 units, a 10-unit (mmol/l) drop, might cut risk by 75 percent! This is not only a much more substantial reduction than can be made for cholesterol, but it’s also more achievable. How? With nutrients, not drugs.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c16-s01-s02"><em>Cancer—cut your risk by a third</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer is about 85 percent preventable. Research published in the New <em>England Journal of Medicine</em> describing a study involving forty-five thousand pairs of twins found that cancer is more likely to be caused by diet and lifestyle choices than by genes. The results of the study showed that identical twins, who are genetically the same, have no more than a 15 percent chance of developing the same cancer. This suggests that the cause of most cancers is about 85 percent environmental—that is, down to factors such as diet, lifestyle, and exposure to toxic chemicals. The study found that choices about diet, smoking, and exercise accounted for 58 to 82 percent of cancers studied.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts058" id="c16-nts058a"><sup class="frac">58</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Where does homocysteine come into all this? Cancer is triggered by damage to DNA—and having a high homocysteine level makes your DNA more vulnerable to damage and not easily properly repaired once damaged. At the other end of the scale, high homocysteine has been found to be a very good indicator of whether cancer therapies are working. The homocysteine level rises when tumors grow and falls when they shrink. Forms of cancer already clearly linked to high homocysteine include cancers of the breast and colon, and leukemia, among others. Low homocysteine is likely to reduce your risk of these by a third. By lowering your homocysteine level, along with making other dietary and supplement changes, you should be able to cut your cancer risk by substantially more than half.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c16-s01-s03"><em>Diabetes—lower your risk substantially</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes is highly preventable, yet more and more young people are developing it. The obesity “epidemic” in the West has helped fuel this rise. If you are obese, the risk of developing diabetes goes up seventy-seven times! Diabetics are at risk of having high homocysteine because we now know that the abnormally raised insulin seen in most diabetics stops the body from lowering and maintaining a healthier homocysteine level. By following a homocysteine-lowering diet and taking supplements, you will be able to help reduce your risk of diabetes or, if you <a id="page141"/>are diabetic, you’ll be able to help keep the condition under better control and reduce complications.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c16-s01-s04"><em>Alzheimer’s disease—halve your risk</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The evidence indicates that if you can lower your H score, you will significantly lower your risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease. Homocysteine is strongly linked to damage in the brain. Dr. Matsu Toshifumi and colleagues at Tohoku University, Japan, conducted brain scans on 153 elderly people and checked them against each individual’s homocysteine level. The evidence was crystal clear—the higher the homocysteine, the greater the damage to the brain.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts059" id="c16-nts059a"><sup class="frac">59</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A recent study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> charted the health of 1,092 elderly people without dementia, measuring their homocysteine levels. Within the next eight years, 111 were diagnosed with dementia. Eighty-three of this group were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Those with a high blood homocysteine level (in this study, above 14 units) had nearly double the risk of Alzheimer’s. All this strongly suggests that following a homocysteine-lowering regime should, at the very least, halve your risk of developing Alzheimer’s in later years.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts060" id="c16-nts060a"><sup class="frac">60</sup></a></p>
<h3 class="section" id="c16-s01-s05"><em>Halve your risk of death from all causes</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">One of the best ways to extend your healthy life span is by reducing your homocysteine level. This is because, with every 5-unit (mmol/l) increase in your H score, you gain:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>A 49 percent increased risk of death from all causes</li>
<li>A 50 percent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>A 26 percent increased risk of death from cancer</li>
<li>A 104 percent increased risk of death from causes other than cancer or heart disease</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">These are the extraordinary findings of a comprehensive research study at the University of Bergen in Norway, published in 2001 in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em>.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts061" id="c16-nts061a"><sup class="frac">61</sup></a> The researchers measured the homocysteine levels of 4,766 men and women aged sixty-five to sixty-seven back in 1992 and then recorded any deaths over the next five years, during which 162 men and 97 women died. They then looked at the risk of death in relation to the individuals’ homocysteine levels. Remarkably, they not only reconfirmed the relationship between heart attacks, strokes, and high homocysteine, but also <a id="page142"/>found that “a strong relation was found between homocysteine and all causes of mortality.” In other words, homocysteine is an accurate predictor of how long you are going to live, whatever the eventual cause of death may be!</p>
<p class="indent">If you are already in your fifties or sixties, you might be tempted to view all this news with gloom. But with a guaranteed solution the news is all good, because you can begin to do something about it right now.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c16-s02"><strong>Measuring your homocysteine</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Your homocysteine level is easy to measure at home (see Resources). Homocysteine is measured in mmol/l. We used to think a “high” level was above 15 units (mmol/l). This is what increases your risk of a heart attack and doubles your Alzheimer’s risk. Now, however, levels as low as 7 units are being linked to increased disease risk. Basically, there’s no official safe level and no guarantee that the diet and supplements you are currently taking are keeping homocysteine at bay. Up to 30 percent of people with a history of heart disease have a homocysteine level above 14 units. The majority of Americans have homocysteine levels above 10. However, experts believe that a level below 6 units is ideal. If you have any of the associated risk factors below it’s especially important to get tested.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c16-s03"><strong>High homocysteine risk factors</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">These include:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Genetic inheritance, meaning family history of heart disease, strokes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, or diabetes</li>
<li>Folate intake of less than 900 mcg/day</li>
<li>Increasing age</li>
<li>Male sex</li>
<li>Estrogen deficiency</li>
<li>Excessive alcohol, coffee, or tea intake</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Lack of exercise</li>
<li>Hostility and repressed anger</li>
<li>Inflammatory bowel diseases (celiac, Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis)</li>
<li><em>H. pylori</em>-generated ulcers</li>
<li>Pregnancy</li>
<li><a id="page143"/>Being a strict vegetarian or vegan</li>
<li>High-fat diet with excessive red meat, high-fat dairy intake</li>
<li>High salt intake</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c16-s04"><strong>Lowering your homocysteine</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The good news is that, whatever your homocysteine level is, you can lower it with the right combination of nutrients and dietary changes, together with lifestyle changes designed to reduce your risk. Follow the H Factor Diet below.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>The H Factor Diet</strong></p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s01"><span class="small2">EAT LESS FATTY MEAT AND MORE FISH AND VEGETABLE PROTEIN</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Eat no more than four servings of lean meat a week. Eat fish (but not fried) at least three times a week; and if you’re not allergic or intolerant, a serving of a soy-based food, such as tofu, tempeh, or soy sausages; or beans, such as kidney beans, chickpea hummus, or baked beans, at least five times a week.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s02"><span class="small2">EAT YOUR GREENS</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Have at least five servings of fruit or vegetables a day. This means eating two pieces of fruit every single day and three servings of vegetables. Vary your selections from day to day. Make sure half of what’s on your plate for each main meal is vegetables.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s03"><span class="small2">HAVE A CLOVE OF GARLIC A DAY</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Either eat a clove of garlic a day or take a garlic supplement every day. You can take garlic oil capsules or powdered garlic supplements.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s04"><span class="small2">DON’T ADD SALT TO YOUR FOOD</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Don’t add salt while you’re cooking or to the food on your plate. The only salt I consider healthy is Solo salt, which has half the sodium of ordinary salt and lots of potassium and magnesium. Use this in moderation instead.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s05"><span class="small2">CUT BACK ON TEA AND COFFEE</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Don’t drink more than one cup of caffeinated or noncaffeinated coffee, or two cups of tea, in a day. Instead, choose from the wide variety of herbal teas and grain coffees available.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s06"><a id="page144"/><span class="small2">LIMIT YOUR ALCOHOL</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Limit your alcohol intake to no more than half a pint of beer, or one glass of red wine, in a day. Ideally, limit your intake to two pints of beer or four glasses of wine a week.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s07"><span class="small2">REDUCE YOUR STRESS</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">If you are under a lot of stress, or find yourself reacting stressfully much of the time, make a decision to reduce your stress load by changing both the circumstances that are giving you stress and your attitude. Simple additions to your life, such as yoga, meditation, and/or exercise, or seeing a counselor if you have some issues to resolve, can make all the difference.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s08"><span class="small2">STOP SMOKING</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">If you smoke, make a decision to stop, and seek help to do it. There is simply no safe level of smoking as far as homocysteine and your health are concerned. Smoking is nothing less than slow suicide. The sooner you stop the longer you’ll live.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s09"><span class="small2">CORRECT ESTROGEN DEFICIENCY</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">If you are postmenopausal, or have menopausal symptoms or other menstrual irregularities, check your estrogen and progesterone levels with a hormone saliva test. If you are estrogen- or progesterone-deficient, you can correct this with “natural progesterone” HRT in the form of a transdermal skin cream. Natural progesterone has none of the risks associated with HRT and your body can make its own estrogen from progesterone.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s10"><span class="small2">SUPPLEMENT A HIGH-STRENGTH MULTIVITAMIN EVERY DAY</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">Take a high-strength multivitamin and mineral supplement providing at least 25 mg of the main B vitamins, 200 mcg of folate, and 10 mcg each of vitamins B<sub class="frac">12</sub> and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, plus A, D, and E, and the minerals magnesium, selenium, chromium, and zinc. Also supplement 1 g of vitamin C for general health, as well as the specific homocysteine-lowering nutrients indicated below.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c16-s04-s01-s11"><span class="small2">TAKE HOMOCYSTEINE SUPPLEMENTS</span></h4>
<p class="nonindent">The most powerful and quickest way to restore a normal H score, below 6 units, is to supplement specific homocysteine-lowering nutrients. These include vitamins B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, folic acid, trimethyl glycine (TMG), and zinc. Here are the guidelines:</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page145"/><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_032_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="extract1">The current vogue is to recommend folic acid. However, this alone is far less effective than the right nutrients in combination. The amount you need also depends on your current homocysteine level. One study found that homocysteine scores were reduced by 17 percent on high-dose folic acid alone; 19 percent on vitamin B<sub class="frac">12</sub> alone; 57 percent on folic acid plus B<sub class="frac">12</sub>; and 60 percent on folic acid, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">6</sub>.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts062" id="c16-nts062a"><sup class="frac">62</sup></a> All this was achieved in three weeks!</p>
<p class="indent">However, even better results would have been achieved by including trimethyl glycine (TMG). TMG is the best “methyl donor” to supplement, better than SAMe. This is because only it can immediately donate a methyl group to homocysteine, thus detoxifying it (see figure on the next page).</p>
<p class="indent">In a study in New Zealand, the homocysteine scores of patients with chronic kidney failure and very high homocysteine levels were reduced by a further 18 percent when 4 g of TMG was given, along with 50 mg of vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub> and 5,000 mcg of folate, compared with the levels of patients taking just B<sub class="frac">6</sub> and folic acid.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c16-nts063" id="c16-nts063a"><sup class="frac">63</sup></a> Some companies produce combinations of these nutrients (see <a class="hlink" href="http://www.thehfactor.com">www.thehfactor.com</a>). These are the most cost-effective supplements for restoring a healthy homocysteine level.</p>
<p class="indent">The combination of the diet and supplements recommended above has the potential to half your homocysteine score in weeks. The goal is to bring your score to below 6. Mine is 4.5. Your homocysteine score is probably the best objective measure of whether you are achieving optimum nutrition for you.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_033_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page146"/><strong><em>The methyl donors</em></strong>. <em>The body needs “methyl groups.” Choline, found in eggs and in lecithin, contains these, as does TMG (also called betaine), found in sugar beets and other vegetables. TMG is the best source because it can donate one methyl group (becoming DMG) and turn toxic homocysteine into SAMe, the body’s best methyl-group carrier</em>.</p>
