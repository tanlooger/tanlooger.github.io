<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Food Combining—Facts</strong> <strong>and Fallacies</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Many people find that certain types or combinations of food do not suit them. Based on this observation and on his research into health and nutrition, in the 1930s Dr. Howard Hay devised a diet plan popularly known as “food combining,” which has helped millions of people toward better health. He recommended eating a healthy diet consistent with the optimum nutrition approach and formulated rules about which foods you can eat together. The key elements in Dr. Hay’s original theory were to eat “alkaline-forming foods,” to avoid refined and heavily processed foods, to eat fruit on its own, and not to mix protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich foods.</p>
<p class="indent">Protein and carbohydrate are digested differently That is a fact. Carbohydrate digestion starts in the mouth when the digestive enzyme amylase, which is present in saliva, starts to act on the food you chew. Once you swallow food and it enters the relatively acid environment of the stomach, amylase stops working. Only when the food leaves the stomach, where the digestive environment becomes more alkaline, can the next wave of amylase enzymes, this time secreted into the small intestine from the pancreas, continue and complete the digestion of carbohydrate.</p>
<p class="indent">Protein, on the other hand, is not digested in the mouth at all. It needs the acid environment of the stomach and may hang out there for three hours until all the complex proteins are broken down into smaller collections of amino acids known as peptides. This happens only in the stomach because it contains the high levels of hydrochloric acid needed to activate the protein-digesting enzyme pepsin. Once peptides leave the stomach, they meet peptidase enzymes, again from the pancreas, which break them down into individual amino acids, ready for absorption.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a id="page169"/><strong>The myth of the bean</strong></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The simplistic view of food combining is that carbohydrate and protein foods should be separated because they are digested differently. The fact that eating certain kinds of beans produces flatulence is often quoted as a negative effect, because beans contain both protein and carbohydrate. However, it is now known that this is not the reason for beans’ boisterous reputation.</p>
<p class="indent">Some beans contain proteins such as lectin, which cannot be digested by the enzymes in our digestive system, even when eaten alone. These proteins can, however, be digested by the bacteria that live in the large intestine. So when you eat beans you feed not only yourself but also these bacteria. After a good meal of lectin, these bacteria produce gas, hence the flatulence. It has got nothing to do with food combining. Many healthy cultures throughout the world have evolved to eat a diet in which beans or lentils are a staple food—but they suffer no digestive problems.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c19-s01"><strong>Protein and carbohydrate—foods that fight?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Of course, since items of food do not consist exclusively of either carbohydrate or protein, in practical terms separating them means not combining concentrated protein foods with concentrated starch foods. Meat is 50 percent protein and 0 percent carbohydrate. Potatoes are 8 percent protein and 90 percent carbohydrate. In between are beans, lentils, rice, wheat, and quinoa. So where exactly do you draw the line, if a line should be drawn at all?</p>
<p class="indent">A brief excursion into our primitive past may solve the puzzle. The general consensus is that the human race has been eating a predominantly vegetarian diet for millions of years, with the occasional meal of meat or fish. Monkeys or apes can be divided into two types: those that have a ruminantlike digestive tract and slowly digest even the most indigestible fibrous foods, much like a cow; and those that have a much speedier and technologically advanced digestive system that produces a whole series of different enzyme secretions. We fit into the second category. The system is more efficient but can handle only foods that are easier to digest—fruit, young leaves, certain vegetables. No stalks for us! Evolutionary theorists believe that this digestive system did two things: firstly, it gave us the motive to improve our mental and sensory processing so we would know when and where to find the food we needed, and secondly, it gave us the nutrients to develop a more advanced brain and nervous system.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c19-s01-s01"><a id="page170"/><em>Did monkeys eat meat and two vegetables?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">I believe the human body has three basic programs for digestion. The first is for digesting concentrated protein, which means meat, fish, and eggs. To digest these foods we have to produce vast amounts of stomach acid and protein-digesting enzymes. After all, when our early ancestors had hunted down and killed an animal, do you think they then went off to handpick a few tasty morsels of vegetation to create that “balanced meal”? I doubt it. I imagine they ate their catch, organs and all, as fast as possible before it spoiled and other predators moved in. They might have spent a couple of days living on nothing but concentrated animal protein. Fresh, raw, organic meat is, after all, highly nutritious.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c19-s01-s02"><em>Fruit—the Lone Ranger</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">At certain times of the year, early humans would have had access to certain fruit. No doubt we were not the only fruit-eating creatures. Since fruit is the best fuel for instant energy, requiring very little digestion, our second program produces the enzymes and hormones necessary to process the simple carbohydrates in fruit. Again, my guess is that we mainly ate fruit on its own. After all, once you had chomped three bananas, there would be little reason to go digging up a few roots.</p>
<p class="indent">Many kinds of soft fruit ferment rapidly once ripe. They will do the same if you put them in a warm, acidic environment, which is what the stomach is. That is what happens if you eat a slice of melon followed by a steak. So Dr. Hay’s advice to eat fruit separately makes a lot of sense. Since fruit takes around thirty minutes to pass through the stomach, whereas whole concentrated protein takes two to three hours, the best time to eat fruit is as a snack more than thirty minutes before a meal or not less than two hours after a meal—possibly more if you eat a lot of concentrated protein. The only exception to this advice is combining fruits that do not readily ferment, like bananas, apples, or coconut, with complex carbohydrate-rich foods such as oats or millet. So a chopped apple on your porridge or a whole-rye banana sandwich would be fine.</p>
<p class="indent">However, for most of the time our ancestors seem to have eaten a varied vegan diet. That means leaf vegetables, root vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and sprouts. This, I propose, is the third and most common digestive program—for a mixture of foods containing a mixture of carbohydrate and protein, but never as protein-dense as meat. I see no problem in combining rice, lentils, beans, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c19-s01-s03"><a id="page171"/><strong>80 percent alkaline</strong></h3>
<p class="nonindent">One of Dr. Hay’s greatest observations was that people with more acidic blood were more likely to be ill. He identified a range of acidity, a pH of 7.4 to 7.5, which is slightly alkaline and associated with good health. A pH of 7 or below is increasingly acid, while a pH above 7 is increasingly alkaline.</p>
<p class="indent">Many factors affect the acid-alkaline balance of the blood.</p>
<p class="indent">When foods are metabolized, acids are produced that are neutralized by the alkaline salts (carbonates) of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. So our intake of these mineral salts affects our acid-alkaline balance, as does the type of food we eat. Foods containing large amounts of chlorine, phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen (for example, most animal products), tend to be acid forming. Those rich in calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium (for example, most vegetables), tend to be alkaline forming. Exercise too has an effect—it makes the blood more acidic. Deep breathing makes the blood more alkaline.</p>
<p class="indent">In her book <em>The Wright Diet</em>, Celia Wright describes the overacidic person as being grouchy, sensitive, and exhausted, inclined to aches and pains, headaches, problems with sleeping, and acidity of the stomach. Smokers have been found to have a high acid level in their urine. Cravings appear to decrease on a more alkaline diet.</p>
<p class="indent">Nearly all fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes are alkaline forming. Exceptions include butter beans and fava beans, asparagus, olives, and mustard and cress. Meat, fish, eggs, and butter are acid forming, while skimmed milk and whole milk are mildly alkaline forming. A few starches are acidic, including oatmeal, whole wheat flour, sago, and tapioca. Walnuts and hazelnuts are acidic, but other nuts are alkaline. (For a comprehensive list of acid and alkaline foods see the chart in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p09_r1.htm">part 9</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">No doubt part of the success of Dr. Hay’s approach was his emphasis on alkaline-forming foods. This, as you can see, means eating plenty of fruits and vegetables that are naturally high in many vital nutrients.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c19-s02"><strong>Refined carbohydrates are out</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Refining food, or cooking it, Dr. Hay did not recommend either. As explained earlier, the more refined, processed, or cooked a food is, the less nutrition it will provide. The obvious advice is to eat raw or lightly cooked whole foods instead of overcooked and overprocessed junk foods. Refined high-sugar foods are a new invention as far as your digestive system is concerned. Very few naturally occurring foods contain the kinds of concentrations of fast-releasing <a id="page172"/>sugars that modern food can provide. The body is simply not adapted to deal with a flood of fast-releasing sugars that not only make your blood sugar levels rocket, requiring all sorts of hormones to swing into emergency action to restore the balance, but also feed potentially undesirable microorganisms that can occur in the gut.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c19-s03"><strong>Improve your digestion</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">In a nutshell, food combining can be condensed into five simple steps, as shown in the illustration below. If you still have problems digesting these food combinations, you may have a digestive enzyme deficiency, a food intolerance, or a gut infestation of candida or unfriendly bacteria and should see a nutritionist. Vegans have only one rule to follow, which is to eat certain fruits separately. Easy, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="center2"><a id="page173"/><strong>Five quick guidelines to help improve your digestion</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Eat 80 percent alkaline-forming foods, 20 percent acid-forming foods. This means eating large quantities of vegetables and fruit, and less-concentrated protein foods like beans, lentils, and whole grains instead of meat, fish, cheese, and eggs.</li>
<li>Eat fast-fermenting and acid fruit on their own as snacks. Most soft fruits, including peaches, plums, mangoes, papayas, strawberries, and melons, ferment quickly. High-acid fruit (although alkaline-forming) may also inhibit digestion of carbohydrate; they include oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and pineapple. All these fruits require little digestion, releasing their natural fructose content quickly. Eat them on their own as a snack when you need an energy boost.</li>
<li>Eat animal protein on its own or with vegetables. Concentrated protein like meat, fish, hard cheese, and eggs requires lots of stomach acid and a stay of about three hours in the stomach to be digested. So do not combine fast-releasing or refined carbohydrates or food that ferments with animal protein.</li>
<li>Avoid all refined carbohydrates. Eat unrefined, fast-releasing carbohydrates with unrefined slow-releasing carbohydrates. Fruits that do not readily ferment, such as bananas, apples, and coconut, can be combined with slow-releasing carbohydrate cereals like oats and millet.</li>
<li>Do not eat until your body is wide awake. Do not expect to digest food when your body is asleep. In the morning, leave at least an hour between waking up and eating. If you take exercise in the morning, eat afterward. Never start your day with a stimulant (tea, coffee, or a cigarette), because the “stress” state inhibits digestion. For breakfast, eat only carbohydrate-based foods such as cereal and fruit, just fruit, or whole-grain rye toast. In the evening, leave at least two hours between finishing dinner and going to sleep.</li>
</ul>
