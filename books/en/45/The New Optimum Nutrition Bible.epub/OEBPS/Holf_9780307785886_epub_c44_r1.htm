<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Your Optimum Diet</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Before foods can give us vitality, hundreds of chemical reactions must take place, involving twenty-eight vitamins and minerals. These micronutrients are the real keys that unlock the potential energy in our food.</p>
<p class="indent">Your vitality depends upon a careful balance of at least fifty nutrients. They include sources of energy, measured in calories, which may come from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins; thirteen known vitamins; fifteen minerals; twenty-four amino acids (which we get when proteins are digested); and two essential fatty acids. Even though the requirement for some minerals, like selenium, is less than a millionth of our requirement for protein, it is no less important. In fact, one-third of all chemical reactions in our bodies are dependent on tiny quantities of minerals and even more on vitamins. Without just one of any of these nutrients, vitality, energy, and ideal weight are just not possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, deficiency in protein, fat, or carbohydrate is very rare. Unfortunately, deficiency in vitamins, minerals, and essential fats is not, despite popular belief. Many nutritionists believe that as few as one in ten people receives sufficient vitamins, minerals, and essential fats from their diet for optimum health.</p>
<p class="indent">As much as two-thirds of the average calorie intake consists of fat, sugar, and refined flour. The calories in sugar are called “empty” because they provide no nutrients, and those are often hidden in processed foods and snacks. If a quarter of your diet by weight, and two-thirds by calories, consists of such dismembered foods, there is little room left to get the levels you need of all the essential nutrients.</p>
<p class="indent">Wheat has twenty-five nutrients removed in the refining process that turns it into white flour, yet only four (iron and vitamins B<sub class="frac">1</sub>, B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">3</sub>) are <a id="page388"/>replaced. On average, 87 percent of the essential minerals zinc, chromium, and manganese are lost. Processed meats like hamburger and sausage are no better: the use of inferior meat high in fat lowers the nutrient content. Eggs, fish, and chicken are nutrient-rich sources of protein, but protein deficiency is rarely a problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, beans, and grains are full of vitality, being whole foods. Many are “seed” foods, so they have to contain everything that the plant needs to grow, including zinc. Broccoli, carrots, peas, and sweet potatoes are rich in antioxidants. Peppers, broccoli, and fruit are rich in vitamin C and other phytonutrients. Seeds and nuts are rich in essential fats. Beans and grains provide both protein and complex carbohydrate. Foods such as these should make up at least half, if not all, of your diet.</p>
<p class="indent">The perfect diet pyramid below gives you the kind of balance of foods to aim for in your diet.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><a id="page390"/><strong>0–4:</strong> You are obviously a health-conscious individual and your minor indiscretions are unlikely to affect your health. Provided you supplement your diet with the right vitamins and minerals, you can look forward to a long and healthy life.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>5–9:</strong> You are on the right track, but must be a little stricter with yourself. Rather than giving up your bad habits, set yourself easy experiments. For instance, for one month go without two or three of the foods or drinks you know are not good for you. See how you feel. Some you may decide to have occasionally, while others you may find you go off. But be strict for one month—your cravings will only be short-term withdrawal symptoms. Aim to have your score below five within three months.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>10–14:</strong> Your diet is not good and you will need to make some changes to be able to reach optimum health. But take it a step at a time. You should aim to have your score down to five within six months. Start by following the advice in this chapter, backed up by the advice in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p02_r1.htm">part 2</a>. You will find that some of your bad dietary habits will change for the better as you discover tasty alternatives. The bad habits that remain should be dealt with one at a time. Remember that sugar, salt, coffee, and chocolate are all addictive foods. Your cravings for them will dramatically decrease or go away altogether after one month without them.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>15–20:</strong> There is no way you can continue to eat like this and remain in good health. You are consuming far too great a quantity of fat, refined foods, and artificial stimulants. Follow the advice in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_p02_r1.htm">part 2</a> very carefully and make gradual and permanent changes to your lifestyle. For instance, take two questions to which you answered yes and make changes so that one month later you could answer no (one example would be to stop eating sugar and drinking coffee in the first month). Keep doing this until your score is five or less. You may feel worse for the first two weeks, but within a month you will begin to feel the positive effects of healthy eating.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c44-s02"><strong>Eating for vitality</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">One secret of longer and healthier life is to eat foods high in vitamin and mineral vitality, but this is not the only criterion for judging a food. Good food should also be low in fat, salt, and fast-releasing sugars; high in fiber; and alkaline forming. Nonanimal sources of protein are desirable. Such a diet will also be low in calories, but then you will not have to count them because your body will become increasingly efficient and not crave extra food. A craving for food when you have already eaten enough calories is often a craving for more nutrients, so foods providing “empty” calories are strictly to be avoided.</p>
