<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>The Fats of Life</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Fat is good for you! Eating the right kind of fat is absolutely vital for optimal health. Essential fats reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, allergies, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, eczema, depression, fatigue, infections, PMS—the list of symptoms and diseases associated with deficiency is growing every year. If you are fat-phobic, you are depriving yourself of essential health-giving nutrients and increasing your risk of poor health. The same is true if the fat you eat is hard—this means fat from dairy products, meat, and most varieties of margarine.</p>
<p class="indent">The human brain is 60 percent fat and one-third of the fat in your diet should come from essential fats if you want to achieve your full potential for health and happiness. In fact, unless you go out of your way to eat the right kinds of fat-rich foods, such as seeds, nuts, and fish, the chances are that you are not getting enough good fat. Most people in the Western world eat too much saturated fat, the kind that kills, and too little of the essential fats, the kinds that heal.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s01"><strong>Fat figures</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">It is considered optimum to consume no more than 20 percent of your total calories in the form of fat. The current average in the U.S. is above 35 percent. Inhabitants of countries that have a low incidence of fat-related diseases, like Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, consume only about 20 percent of their total calorie intake as fat. For example, Japanese people eat on average 40 grams of fat a day, whereas Americans eat about double that.</p>
<p class="indent">Saturated and monounsaturated fats are not essential nutrients: you do not need them, although they can be used by the body to make energy. But polyunsaturated fats or oils are essential. Almost all foods that contain <a id="page70"/>fat have a balance of all three. A piece of meat will contain mainly saturated and monounsaturated fat with little polyunsaturated fat. Olive oil has mainly monounsaturated fat. Sunflower seed oil has mainly polyunsaturated fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Most authorities now agree that no more than one-third of our total fat intake should be saturated (hard) fat and at least one-third should be polyunsaturated oils providing the two essential fats: the linoleic acid family, known as omega-6, and the alpha-linolenic acid family, known as omega-3. The ideal balance between these two is roughly the same amount of omega-6 as of omega-3. So an ideal “fat profile,” based on fat forming no more than 20 percent of our total calorie intake, might consist of:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>3.5 percent omega-6</li>
<li>3.5 percent omega-3</li>
<li>7 percent monounsaturated fat</li>
<li>6 percent saturated fat</li>
</ul>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_010_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>Fat intake</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Most people are deficient in both omega-6 and omega-3 fats; however, the real change in modern living is a vast increase in saturated fat and a decrease in omega-3 fats (see figure below). In addition, a lot of the polyunsaturated <a id="page71"/>fats we eat are damaged and become “trans” fats or processed fats, known as “hydrogenated” fats. These stop the body making good use of the small quantity of essential fats that the average person eats in a day.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_011_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><strong><em>How fat intake has changed</em></strong>. <em>In modern times, total fat intake has increased. Saturated fat intake has increased, although it is now leveling off. Omega-6 fat intake has increased, but this is slightly misleading because much of it is “hydrogenated” vegetable oils, which act like saturated fats. Intake of omega-3 fats, in fish and seeds, has gone down, leading to widespread deficiency</em>.</p>
<p class="figure"><em>Leaf and Weber. 1987</em>. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition <em>45: 1048–53</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s02"><strong>The omega-6 fat family</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The grandmother of the omega-6 fat family is linoleic acid, which is converted by the body into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Evening primrose oil and borage oil are the richest known sources of GLA, and if you take these in supplement form you need less overall oil to obtain enough omega-6 fats. <a id="page72"/>The ideal intake is around 100 mg of GLA a day, equivalent to 1,000 mg of evening primrose oil or 500 mg of high-potency borage oil—a capsule a day.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_012_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><em>Fats that heal, fats that kill</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">GLA is the precursor for two fats. Some GLA is converted into arachidonic acid. This type of fat is used to build the brain, along with the omega-3 fat DHA. GLA is also converted into DGLA (dihom-gamma-linolenic acid) and from there into prostaglandins, which are extremely active hormonelike substances. The particular kinds made from these omega-6 oils are called <a id="page73"/>series 1 prostaglandins. They keep the blood thin, which prevents clots and blockages, relaxes blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, helps maintain the water balance in the body, decreases inflammation and pain, improves nerve and immune function, and helps insulin work, which is good for blood sugar balance. And this is only the beginning. Every year more and more health-promoting functions of prostaglandins are being discovered.</p>
<p class="indent">Prostaglandins themselves cannot be supplemented, as they are very shortlived; we rely instead on a good intake of their source, omega-6 fats. This family of fats comes exclusively from seeds and their oils. The best are hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, safflower, sesame, corn, walnut, soybean, and wheat germ oil. About half of the fats in these oils come from the omega-6 family, mainly as linoleic acid. An optimal intake, if this were your only source of essential fats, would be one to two tablespoons of oil a day or two to three tablespoons of ground seeds.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s03"><strong>The omega</strong>-<strong>3 fat family</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The modern diet is much more deficient in omega-3 fats than in omega-6. This is because the grandmother of the omega-3 family, alpha-linolenic acid, and her metabolically active grandchildren EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), from which series 3 prostaglandin are made, are more unsaturated and more prone to damage in cooking and food processing. Hence, they are often purposely excluded from convenience foods. This, plus the reduced consumption of fish, is fueling the epidemics of cardiovascular disease and mental health problems since both brain and body depend on omega-3 fats. As these fats get converted in the body to more “active” substances, they become more unsaturated, and generally the word used for them gets longer (for instance, oleic acid: one degree of unsaturation; linoleic: two degrees of unsaturation; linolenic: three degrees of unsaturation; eicosapentaenoic: five degrees of unsaturation).</p>
<p class="indent">You can observe this increasing complexity as we move up the food chain. Plankton, for example, the staple food of small fish, is rich in alpha-linolenic acid. The little fish eat the plankton, then the carnivorous fish, like mackerel or herring, eat the small fish, which have converted some of their alpha-linolenic acid into more complex fats. The carnivorous fish continue the conversion. Seals eat them and have the highest EPA and DHA concentration. Finally, Eskimos eat the seals and benefit from a ready-made meal of EPA and DHA. You, if you want to have a healthy brain and body … eat Eskimos! Actually, the Inuit people, as they are properly known, have a very <a id="page74"/>low incidence of cardiovascular disease despite a very high intake of fat and cholesterol. This really emphasizes that it is the kind of fat you eat, not how much, that is most important.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_013_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><strong><em>The omega-3 and omega-6 fat families</em></strong>. <em>Omega-6 seed oils are processed in the body from linoleic acid into GLA (gamma-linoienic acid). GLA is found in evening primrose oil and in borage oil. GLA can also be turned into arachidonic acid, an essential fat found in meat and milk. However, you don’t want too much arachidonic add because it encourages inflammation by making series 2 prostaglandins (PGE2). Series 1 prostaglandins (PGE1) are anti-inflammatory</em>.<br/><em>Omega-3 seed oils, found most predominantly in flaxseeds, are processed by the body from alpha-linolenic acid into EPA (eicosapentaenoic add) and then into DHA (docosahexaenoic add). EPA and DHA are found directly in fish. These, in turn, make series 3 prostaglandins (PGE3), which are anti-inflammatory</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The omega-3 fats EPA and DHA make prostaglandins, which are essential for proper brain function, which affects vision, learning ability, coordination, and mood. Like series 1 prostaglandins, they reduce the stickiness of the <a id="page75"/>blood, as well as control blood cholesterol and fat levels, improve immune function and metabolism, reduce inflammation, and maintain water balance.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s04"><strong>Where to find omega-3 and omega-6 fats</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The best seed oils for omega-3 fats are flax (also known as linseed), hemp, and pumpkin. While these are certainly good for you, only somewhere between 3 and 10 percent of these oils gets converted into EPA and DHA. In much the same way as evening primrose oil bypasses the first “conversion” stage of linoleic acid, if you eat carnivorous fish such as mackerel, herring, tuna, and salmon or their oils, you can bypass the first two conversion stages of alpha-linolenic acid and go straight to EPA and DHA. Fish, especially cold-water fish, are the best direct source of these brain boosters. This is why fish eaters like the Japanese have three times more omega-3 fats in their body fat than the average American. Vegans, who eat more seeds and nuts, have twice the omega-3 fat level of the average American.</p>
<p class="indent">The highest concentrations of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA are found in mackerel, herring, lake trout, salmon, tuna, sardines, swordfish, and white fish, more or less in this order. Mackerel typically contains ten times more EPA and DHA per serving than swordfish or white fish. A 3.5 oz. (100 g) serving of mackerel could give you as much as 2.5 grams of combined EPA and DHA.</p>
<p class="indent">The best seeds for omega-6 fats are hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, safflower, sesame, and corn. Walnuts, soybeans, and wheat germ are also rich in omega-6 fats.<br/><br/></p>

<p class="extract1"><a id="page76"/>So what should you eat to get an optimal intake of these essential fats? There are three possibilities: eat seeds and fish; eat seed oils, which are more concentrated in essential fats but don’t provide other nutrients such as minerals, which are found in the whole seeds; or supplement concentrated fish oils and seed oils such as flax, evening primrose, or borage oil.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c09-s04-s01"><em>Seeds and fish</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">If you want to do it with seeds, put one measure each of sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds, and three measures of flaxseeds, in a sealed jar. Keep it in the refrigerator, away from light, heat, and oxygen. Simply adding one heaping tablespoon of these seeds, ground in a coffee grinder, to your breakfast each morning guarantees a good daily intake of essential fatty acids. I’d recommend also eating 100 g of oily fish twice a week.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c09-s04-s02"><em>Seed oils</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">If you want to do it with oils, the best place to start is with an oil blend that offers a 1:1 ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats. You want an oil blend that is cold-pressed, preferably organic and kept refrigerated before you buy it. These are now widely available in health food stores (see Resources). You need about a tablespoon a day of such an oil and can add it to salads and other foods (without heating) or just take it straight. Hemp seed oil is the next best thing. It provides 19 percent alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3), 57 percent linoleic acid, and 2 percent GLA (both of the latter omega-6).</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c09-s04-s03"><em>Essential fat supplements</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">As far as supplements are concerned, for omega-6 your best bet is borage oil or evening primrose oil. Borage oil provides more GLA and you need at least 100 mg of GLA a day. Fish oils are best for omega-3 and you need at least 200 mg of EPA and 200 mg of DHA—or 400 mg of these two combined. So, either supplement one GLA capsule and one fish oil capsule rich in EPA and DHA, or find a supplement that combines EPA, DHA, and GLA and take two a day.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>Top tip—eat seeds</strong></p>
<p class="extract">Smart animals—from parrots to people—eat seeds. Seeds are incredibly rich in essential fats, minerals, vitamin E, and protein. You need a tablespoon a day for 100 percent health. Here’s the magic formula:<br/><br/></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><a id="page77"/>Fill a glass jar with an airtight lid half with flaxseeds (rich in omega-3) and half with a combination of sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin seeds (rich in omega-6).<br/><br/></li>
<li>Keep the jar sealed, and place in the refrigerator to minimize damage from light, heat, and oxygen.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Put a handful in a coffee or seed grinder, grind up, and put on cereals or soups.</li>
</ol>
<p class="center3"> </p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s05"><strong>The benefits of olive oil</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">While olive oil contains no appreciable amounts of the essential omega-3 and omega-6 oils, much of it is cold-pressed and unrefined. This makes it better for you than refined vegetable oils like the sunflower oil you can buy in the supermarket. Also, while there is a strong association between a high intake of saturated fats, mainly from meat and dairy products, and cardiovascular disease, the reverse is true for olive oil. People in Mediterranean countries, whose diets include large quantities of olive oil, have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, this may be due to a number of positive factors in their diet, including a high intake of fruit and vegetables and relatively more fish than meat. The use of cold-pressed olive oil, which contains tiny amounts of phytochemicals, also results in fewer trans fats (see <a class="hlink" href="#page78">this page</a>) being consumed.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s06"><strong>Cook with coconut butter or olive oil</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">While I’ve extolled the virtues of the essential polyunsaturated fats in seed and fish oils, these highly active nutrients are very prone to damage and hence are not good for high-temperature cooking such as frying. If you do fry, sauté, or bake foods, it is best not to use polyunsaturated fats because these generate oxidizing free radicals. It is much better to use a saturated fat, the best being coconut butter, or a monounsaturated oil, the best of which is olive oil. These don’t generate the harmful free radicals.</p>
<p class="indent">Coconut butter is much better for you than regular butter or lard (meat fat). This is because it is what’s called a short-chain saturated fat, rather than a long-chain saturated fat. While health problems such as increased risk of heart disease have been associated with a diet high in animal fats, the same has not been shown for coconut butter or coconut milk. I use coconut butter and olive oil for sautéing foods, both of which add flavor.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_014_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page78"/><em>Seed jar</em>.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s07"><strong>The dangers of trans fats</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Refining and processing vegetable oils can change the nature of the polyunsaturated oil. An example of this is provided by the process used in making margarine. To turn vegetable oil into hard fat, the oil goes through a process called hydrogenation. Although the fat is still technically polyunsaturated, the body cannot make use of it. Even worse, it blocks the body’s ability to use healthy polyunsaturated oils. This kind of fat is called a trans fat because its nature has been changed—it is like a key that fits the body’s chemical locks but will not open the door. Most margarines contain these so-called “hydrogenated polyunsaturated oils” and are best avoided. So too are manufactured foods that contain hydrogenated fats, so check ingredients lists on labels carefully. I use pumpkin seed butter instead of butter or margarine as a spread. It tastes delicious.</p>
<p class="indent">Frying, as mentioned earlier, is another way to damage otherwise healthy oils. The high temperature makes the oil oxidize so, instead of being good for you, it generates harmful free radicals in the body (explained fully in <a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_c15_r1.htm">chapter 15</a>). Frying is therefore best avoided as much as possible, as is any form of <a id="page79"/>burning or browning fat. If you do fry, use a tiny amount of olive oil or butter because they are less prone to oxidation than top-quality cold-pressed vegetable oils. The latter should be kept sealed in the refrigerator, away from heat, light, and air and only used cold in salad dressings or instead of butter on your baked potato or peas.</p>
<p class="center2"><strong>General guidelines for getting the right kind and amount of fat in your diet</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Eat seeds and nuts—the best seeds are flax, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame. You get more goodness out of them by grinding them first and sprinkling them on cereal, soups, and salads.</li>
<li>Eat cold-water carnivorous fish—a serving of herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines, or, occasionally, fresh tuna two or three times a week provides a good source of omega-3 fats.</li>
<li>Use cold-pressed seed oils—choose either an oil blend or hemp oil for salad dressings and other cold uses, such as drizzling on vegetables instead of butter.</li>
<li>Use pumpkin seed butter as a spread instead of butter or margarine.</li>
<li>Minimize your intake of fried food, processed food, and saturated fat from meat and dairy products.</li>
<li>Supplement fish oil for omega-3 fats and borage or evening primrose oil for omega-6 fats.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In practical terms, you may want to pursue a combined strategy to ensure an optimal intake of fats for your brain. Here’s what I recommend:<br/><br/></p>
