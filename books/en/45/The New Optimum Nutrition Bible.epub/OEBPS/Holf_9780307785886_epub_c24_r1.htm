<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Boosting Your Immune</strong> <strong>System</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Louis Pasteur, who discovered in the nineteenth century that microorganisms were responsible for infections, realized late in his life that strengthening the body, rather than conquering the invading organism, might prove a more effective strategy. Yet for the last hundred years, medicine has focused on drugs designed to destroy the invader—antibiotics, antiviral agents, chemotherapy. By their very nature, these drugs are poison to the body. AZT, the first prescribable anti-HIV drug, is potentially harmful and proving less effective than vitamin C.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts023" id="c24-nts023a"><sup class="frac">23</sup></a> Although initially antibiotics fight bacterial infection, in the long term they may do more harm than good as they encourage the evolution of new drug-resistant strains of bacteria.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts024" id="c24-nts024a"><sup class="frac">24</sup></a> Chemotherapy depletes the immune system and, even in the best situations, wins a victory at a cost.</p>
<p class="indent">Only recently, with the seemingly endless onslaught of new infectious agents, has attention turned within—toward strengthening our immunity. The immune system is one of the most remarkable and complex systems within the human body. When you realize that it has the ability to produce a million specific “straitjackets” (called antibodies) within a minute and to recognize and disarm a billion different invaders (called antigens), the strategy of boosting immune power makes a lot of sense. The ability to react rapidly to a new invader makes all the difference between a minor twenty-four-hour cold or stomach bug and a week in bed with flu or food poisoning. It may also be the difference between a nonmalignant lump and breast cancer or a symptom-free HIV infection and full-blown AIDS.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c24-s01"><a id="page209"/><strong>Immune power</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">How do you boost your immune power? Exercise, your state of mind, and your diet all play a part. Overtraining or vigorous exercise actually suppresses the immune system, while the Chinese art of tai chi has been shown to increase the count of T cells (one of the body’s types of immune cell) by 40 percent. Calming rather than stressful forms of exercise are probably best for immunity. This may be because corticosteroids, substances produced by the adrenal glands as a response to stress (and also taken as the drug cortisone), suppress the immune system. This too may be a key explanation for numerous studies that have found that low psychological states such as stress, depression, and grief depress the immune system. Learning how to cope with stress, deal with psychological issues, and relax is an important part of boosting the immune system. Meditation, for example, has been shown to increase T-cell counts and improve the T-helper/suppressor ratio (see <a class="hlink" href="#page211">this page</a>).<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts025" id="c24-nts025a"><sup class="frac">25</sup></a></p>
<h2 class="section" id="c24-s02"><strong>Understanding immunity</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The purpose of the immune system is to identify the body’s enemies and destroy them. These enemies include defective body cells as well as foreign agents such as bacteria and viruses. The main “gates” into the body are the digestive tract, which lets in food, and the lungs, which let in air. Within the digestive tract is the “gut-associated immune system,” which is programmed to allow completely digested food particles, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars, to pass unhindered through the gut wall into the body. Incompletely digested food can result in immune reactions and eventually allergies, especially if large food molecules pass into the bloodstream. The nasal passages help prevent unwanted agents from entering the lungs. Healthy, strong mucous membranes in the respiratory and digestive tract are the first line of defense against invaders.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c24-s02-s01"><em>The immune army</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Inside the body, the immune system has an army of special cells to deal with invaders. These defenders differ in their function and territory. For example, some cells operate in the blood, keeping an eye out for invaders and calling up other troops that can destroy specific invaders. The three main types of immune cell found in the blood, collectively called white cells, are B cells, T cells, and macrophages.</p>
<p class="indent">B cells, or B lymphocytes, are produced in an antibody for each specific invader or antigen. When a B cell comes into contact with an antigen, it grows larger and divides into several cells that secrete specific antibodies that latch on to the invader. Antibodies cannot destroy bacteria and viruses, but they do give them a hard time. They stop bacteria producing toxins, and they <a id="page210"/>prevent viruses from entering body cells. Since a virus cannot reproduce unless it enters a body cell and takes over the cell’s control center, reprogramming it to produce more viruses, antibodies are a major nuisance for viruses. Antibodies also summon other, more belligerent members of the immune army, such as T cells.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_046_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page211"/><strong><em>The immune army and battleground</em></strong>. <em>The immune system trains specialized cells, such as B or T lymphocytes, from “stem cells” made in bone marrow. These travel around the body, especially in the lymph, protecting you from invaders, be it a virus or a food you are allergic to or even a misbehaving cancer cell</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">T cells, or T lymphocytes, are derived from the thymus gland at the top of the chest. There are three kinds: T-helpers, T-suppressors, and NK (natural killers). NK cells produce toxins that can destroy the invader. T-helpers help activate B cells to product antigens, while T-suppressors turn off the reactions once the battle is won. Normally, there are roughly twice as many T-helpers as T-suppressors. In AIDS, the HIV virus selectively destroys T-helpers, resulting in too many T-suppressors, which depress the immune system, leaving the sufferer susceptible to other infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Macrophages finish off the battle by completely engulfing and digesting the invader that has been identified by B and T cells. This action is called phagocytosis. Phagocytic cells that operate in the blood are called monocytes, while those that operate in other tissues are called macrophages.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c24-s02-s02"><em>The immune battleground</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">At any time, there are a small number of immune cells roaming the body. Many of them have only a short life: T cells, for example, live for about four days. When an invader is identified, new troops are produced in the bone marrow and thymus and posted to forts such as lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, spleen, and Peyer’s patches in the digestive tract that concentrate lymphocytes. Lymphatic vessels drain into these forts, bringing in invaders to be destroyed. That is why lymph nodes, for example, in the neck, armpits, and groin, become inflamed during an infection. This means they are doing their job. Since the lymphatic system doesn’t have a pump, lymphatic fluid is moved along by muscle movement, so physical exercise is important for lymphatic drainage.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c24-s03"><strong>Immune-boosting nutrients</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Your immune strength is totally dependent on an optimal intake of vitamins and minerals. Deficiency of vitamins A, B<sub class="frac">1</sub>, B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, B<sub class="frac">12</sub>, folic acid, C, and E suppresses immunity, as does deficiency of iron, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Vitamins B<sub class="frac">1</sub>, B<sub class="frac">2</sub>, and B<sub class="frac">5</sub> have mild immune-boosting effects compared with B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. The production of antibodies, so critical in any infection, depends upon B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, as does T-cell function. The ideal daily intake is probably 50 to 100 mg. B<sub class="frac">12</sub> and folic acid also both appear essential for proper B-cell and T-cell function. <a id="page212"/>B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, zinc, and folic acid are all needed for the rapid production of new immune cells to engage an enemy.</p>
<p class="indent">Since no nutrients work in isolation, it is a good idea to take a good high-strength multivitamin and mineral supplement. The combination of nutrients at even modest levels can boost immunity very effectively. Dr. Ranjit Chandra, from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and colleagues, in a research study published in <em>The Lancet</em>, took a group of ninety-six healthy elderly people and gave some a supplement of this kind and others a placebo.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts026" id="c24-nts026a"><sup class="frac">26</sup></a> Those on the supplement suffered fewer infections, had a stronger immune system as measured by blood-test determination of immune factors, and were generally healthier than those given the placebo.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c24-s03-s01"><em>Antioxidant power</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The nutrients worth adding in larger amounts to fight off infection are the antioxidants and particularly vitamin C. Most invaders produce the dangerous oxidizing chemicals known as free radicals to fight off the troops of your immune system. Antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins A, C, and E and zinc and selenium, disarm these free radicals, weakening the invader. Vitamin A also helps maintain the integrity of the digestive tract, lungs, and all cell membranes, preventing foreign agents from entering the body and viruses from entering cells. In addition, vitamin A and beta-carotene are potent antioxidants. Many foreign agents produce oxidizing free radicals as part of their defense system. Even our own immune cells produce free radicals to destroy invaders. Therefore, a high intake of antioxidant nutrients helps protect your immune cells from these harmful weapons of war. The ideal intake of beta-carotene is 11,000 to 55,000 IU per day.</p>
<p class="indent">Vitamin E, another important virtuoso, improves B- and T-cell function. Its immune-boosting properties increase when it is given in conjunction with selenium. The ideal daily intake is between 150 to 900 IU. Selenium, iron, manganese, copper, and zinc are all involved in antioxidation and have been shown to affect immune power positively. Of these, selenium and zinc are probably the most important. While zinc is critical for immune cell production and proper functioning of B and T cells, excess zinc can suppress the ability of macrophages to destroy bacteria. The ideal daily intake is 15 to 25 mg. While zinc may be a beneficial supplement during a viral infection, it may not be a good idea to supplement it during a bacterial infection. The same is true for iron. While iron deficiency suppresses immune function, too much iron interferes with the ability of macrophages to destroy bacteria. When an infection is present, the body initiates a series of defense mechanisms <a id="page213"/>designed to stop the invader absorbing iron, so supplementing iron is not recommended during a bacterial infection.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c24-s03-s02"><em>How much C?</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Vitamin C is unquestionably the master immune-boosting nutrient. To date, more than a dozen roles in this capacity have been identified for it. It helps immune cells mature, improves the performance of antibodies and macrophages, and is itself antiviral and antibacterial, as well as able to destroy toxins produced by bacteria. In addition, it is a natural antihistamine, calming down inflammation, and stimulates another part of the immune defense system to produce interferon that boosts immunity. Excessive levels of the stress hormone Cortisol, a potent immunosuppressant, are controlled by sufficient vitamin C. However, the dosage of vitamin C is crucial. Professor Harry Hemilia from the Department of Health at the University of Helsinki examined all studies that tested the effects of vitamin C or a placebo on the common cold, selecting only those that gave 1 gram daily or more. Thirty-seven out of thirty-eight concluded that supplementing 1 gram, twenty times the recommended daily allowance (RDA), had a protective effect. Studies using less than this amount tend not to be conclusive.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c24-s04"><strong>Probiotics—nature’s antibiotics</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Infectious agents are all around us. Whether or not you succumb to them is determined not only by your exposure, but also by your balance of bacteria. The reason for this is that beneficial bacteria both consume the nutrients that would otherwise feed the bad guys and block receptor sites that harmful bacteria have to latch on to in order to cause an infection, for example, by entering the bloodstream. However, the main reason probiotics protect you is that they produce substances such as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which stop harmful bacteria from growing. These are nature’s antibiotics. They not only keep less desirable residents, such as <em>E. coli</em> or enterobacteria, at bay, but also make it very hard for bugs such as staphylococci (responsible for many sore throats), salmonella, and Campylobacter, which cause most cases of food poisoning, to survive. Worldwide, more than a million people die from food poisoning each year.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts027" id="c24-nts027a"><sup class="frac">27</sup></a> In the U.S. there are 1,500,000 cases of salmonella and 2,500,000 cases of Campylobacter infection each year, although the real numbers are probably ten times this.</p>
<p class="indent">Probiotics don’t just give pathogenic bacteria a hard time, they positively boost your immune system. Six research studies have specifically found that different strains of beneficial bacteria improve the fighting power of the <a id="page214"/>immune system. This means that probiotics are also important in the treatment of cancer and allergies, as well as infections caused by viruses, parasites, and yeasts such as <em>Candida albicans</em>, which is responsible for thrush.</p>
<p class="indent">One research study published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> in 1992 gave women prone to thrush either a live yogurt containing lactobacilli for six months or no yogurt.<a class="hlink" href="Holf_9780307785886_epub_bm3_r1.htm#c24-nts028" id="c24-nts028a"><sup class="frac">28</sup></a> After six months, those on yogurt were asked to switch to no yogurt, and vice versa. Most of the women on no yogurt dropped out of the study, while those on daily yogurt refused to switch after six months. They had experienced a substantial reduction in the number and severity of yeast infections. Even more effective is the use of suppositories to deliver probiotics directly into the vagina.</p>
<p class="indent">Probiotics have also proven helpful in treating recurrent bladder infections, sinusitis, and tonsillitis.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c24-s05"><strong>The immune power diet</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The ideal immune-boosting diet is, in essence, no different from the ideal diet for anyone. Since immune cells are produced rapidly during an infection, sufficient protein is essential. However, too much suppresses immunity, probably by using up available vitamin B<sub class="frac">6</sub>. Diets high in saturated or hydrogenated fat suppress immunity and clog up the lymphatic vessels; but essential fats, found in cold-pressed seed oils, boost immunity. Therefore, a well-balanced protein, low-fat diet, with fats obtained from essential sources such as seeds and nuts, together with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals, is best for maximum immunity.</p>
<p class="indent">During a viral infection that increases mucus production, it is best to avoid meat, dairy products, and eggs and also any foods that you suspect you might be allergic to. Great foods are all vegetables, especially carrots, beets and their tops, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and bean sprouts. Fruit is particularly beneficial, especially watermelon and berries, plus ground seeds, lentils, beans, whole grains such as brown rice, and fish. All foods should be eaten as raw as possible, avoiding frying, which introduces free radicals.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c24-s05-s01"><em>Foods for a power diet</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Here are some typical items in an immune power diet:</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Watermelon juice:</strong> Blend the flesh and the seeds in an electric blender. The husks will sink to the bottom, leaving the seeds, which are rich in protein, zinc, selenium, vitamin E, and essential fats, in the juice. Drink a pint for breakfast and another pint during the day.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page215"/><strong>Carrot soup:</strong> Blend three organic carrots, two tomatoes, a bunch of watercress, a third of a package of tofu, half a cup of rice milk or soy milk, a teaspoon of vegetable stock, and (optional) some ground almonds or seeds. Eat cold or heat to serve, accompanied by rice cakes. Alternatively, boil carrots, sweet potato, or butternut squash and make a soup by adding vegetable stock, loads of ginger, and some coconut milk.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>A large salad:</strong> Include a selection of “seed” vegetables (like fava beans), broccoli, grated carrot, beets, zucchini, watercress, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocados, adding seeds or marinated tofu pieces—organic if possible. Serve with a dressing of cold-pressed oil containing some crushed garlic.</p>
<p class="extract"><strong>Berries as a snack:</strong> Strawberries have more vitamin C than oranges. Blueberries have the highest antioxidant power (ORAC) score of all. Raspberries and strawberries are also excellent. Berries contain many phytonutrients that boost your immune system. So, when you are under attack, snack on berries—the more the merrier.</p>
<h4 class="section" id="c24-s05-s01-s01"><em>Useful supplements</em></h4>
<p class="nonindent">These supplements help fight infections naturally:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>A good, high-strength multivitamin and mineral</li>
<li>A good, high-strength antioxidant formula giving at least 6,500 IU of vitamin A, 450 IU of vitamin E, 100 mg of B<sub class="frac">6</sub>, 20 mg of zinc, and 100 mcg of selenium</li>
<li>Vitamin C, 3 g every four hours including last thing at night and immediately on rising (it may have a laxative effect—if it does, reduce the dose accordingly), choosing a supplement that contains berry extracts, especially elderberry</li>
<li>Cat’s claw tea with ginger four times a day</li>
<li>Echinacea, ten drops three times a day</li>
<li>Grapefruit seed extract, ten drops three times a day</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">For maintenance have 1 to 2 grams of vitamin C a day. Some supplements also contain other antioxidants and immune-friendly nutrients such as berry extracts, zinc, or cat’s claw.</p>
