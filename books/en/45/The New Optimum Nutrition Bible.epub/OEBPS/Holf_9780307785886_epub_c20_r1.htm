<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Eat Right for Your</strong> <strong>Blood Type</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Each of us is unique, and each of us has a unique set of inherited genes, which determine our own individual “perfect diet.” Some of us are programmed to function better on more protein, others do well on more carbohydrate. Some of us need more folic acid than others. In the future, it will be possible to determine your “ideal” diet and nutrient intake by testing your pattern of genes, as well as taking into account your diet, lifestyle, and environment.</p>
<p class="indent">One example of your inherited genetic uniqueness is provided by your blood type. There are four blood types and, owing to the pioneering research of naturopath Peter D’Adamo, some nutritionists consider that each of them may be best suited to a specific type of diet. Why? Because blood types have evolved, from O to A to B to AB, as humanity has evolved, with each phase representing a different pattern of diet and environmental challenges. Knowing your blood type may therefore be a key to knowing how your immune system will react to certain foods and to certain diseases and to what you need to eat to maximize your potential for health and vitality.</p>
<p class="indent">The story begins about fifty thousand years ago with the emergence of our early humanoid ancestors, first Neanderthal then Cro-Magnon, who through cunning became the most dangerous predators on earth, the kings of the food chain. Their diet was high in animal protein, and the blood group O—the predominant blood type today—was born. These were the original hunters and every culture still has many type Os. With no natural predators other than themselves, the population of our ancestors exploded. As a consequence, their hunting grounds became exhausted. The Cro-Magnons migrated further afield from their African roots, exhausting big game along <a id="page175"/>the way. By 20,000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Cro-Magnons were in what is now Europe and Asia and eventually migrated to Australasia and the Americas. The failing food supply probably led to rivalry, migration, and wars and may have propelled our early ancestors toward a more omnivorous diet of berries, nuts, grubs, roots, and small animals.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, somewhere between 20,000 and 15,000 <span class="small">B.C</span>., a new blood type gained dominance in western Europe—type A. A is for “agrarian” and reflects the emergence of peasant farmers who grew their own grain and domesticated animals. Type A reflected a whole new digestive and immune program—for much better adapted individuals, who are more resistant to contagious diseases such as cholera, plague, and smallpox; who are able to digest grain and able to cooperate; who are less the hunter and more the cultivator, working in network communities. Very rapidly, type A took over from type O, particularly in western Europe, where it is still most concentrated. Even today, type Os are more susceptible to death from infections than are type As.</p>
<p class="indent">Another mutation took place in the Himalayan highlands somewhere between 15,000 and 10,000 <span class="small">B.C</span>. and blood type B emerged. It was the hallmark of the great tribes of the steppe dwellers—the Caucasian and Mongolian tribes. These tribes were herders. Their diet was more nomadic than that of people living in western Europe and included meat and cultured dairy products. Soon type B spread throughout Asia and into Eastern Europe. B stands for “balance”—a mixture of the vegetarian and meat-eating diets of the As and Os.</p>
<p class="indent">AB blood type is thoroughly modern. Emerging only in the last ten or twelve centuries, it is a very recent evolution of blood type and accounts for less than 5 percent of the world’s population. It probably started as the nomad warriors (type Bs) moved in on the collapsing civilization of the Roman Empire and other European cultures. The result was a multifaceted blood type, complex and unsettled—a perfect metaphor for modern life.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c20-s01"><strong>Blood type—the blueprint for immunity</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Your blood type is your blueprint for immunity. Your cells are tagged with an antigen (a marker), which tells the immune system which cells belong to you. The immune system produces weapons—antibodies—to anything that isn’t you, for example, a virus. It also produces antibodies to other blood types, so a type A will have antibodies to type O or type B cells. That’s why a type A will react to type B or O blood—the blood cells don’t have the right marker so the immune system goes ballistic.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page176"/>Those with blood type AB carry no antibodies to O, A, or B and can receive blood from any group. On the other hand, they cannot donate blood to those having any of the other types of blood. Their cells are tagged with both A and B antigens, so type A reacts to the B antigen, type B reacts to the A antigen, and type O reacts to both!</p>
<p class="indent">Food is the major invader of the body. The need for the immune system to react appropriately to digested material is of paramount importance to survival. That’s why there are more immune cells and activity in the gastrointestinal tract than anywhere else in the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Not unexpectedly, different blood types program the immune system to tolerate different kinds of foods. It really doesn’t matter what you or your immediate ancestors have got used to eating. Your immune system is programmed to accept the kinds of foods that were the major part of your ancestors’ diet thousands of years ago. That’s why a type A (the grain-growing vegetarian) is more likely to react badly to dairy products, the staple of nomadic type Bs, or to a high-meat diet, the staple food of type Os.</p>
<p class="indent">The key to how this works is lectins, which are proteins found in most foods. These proteins have sticking or “agglutinating” properties that help them to attach to other molecules and other molecules to attach to them. Germs and immune cells use lectins to their own benefit. Cells in the liver’s bile ducts have lectins on their surfaces that snatch up bacteria and parasites. Microbes and bacteria use lectins to stick to slippery surfaces such as the gastrointestinal wall. These lectins are often blood-type specific, as are those found in some foods. The lectins in milk have B-like qualities, so type As are more likely to react to them.</p>
<p class="indent">This, in a nutshell, is the basis behind Peter D’Adamo’s work identifying which foods are most suited to which blood type. However, his work isn’t based just on this logic. It’s also based on testing thousands of foods and people and noting which foods raised toxic by-products of these lectin reactions. His research led him to produce certain dietary guidelines for each blood type (see <a class="hlink" href="#page178">this page</a>).</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c20-s02"><strong>Blood types and disease risk</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Knowing your blood type does more than help identify which foods are likely to suit you best. It reflects your unique metabolism and even possibly gives clues to your personality, although the latter is more plausible conjecture <a id="page177"/>than scientific fact. However, what is becoming clear is that your risk of getting certain diseases, and your chances of recovery, may depend on your blood type. D’Adamo’s book explains the connection between blood types and many common diseases and outlines the best strategies for different blood types.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the most interesting story emerging from the ongoing research into disease and blood types is the link to cancer. There is undeniable evidence, says D’Adamo, that people with type A or AB blood have an overall higher rate of cancer and poorer odds of survival than those with type O or B. The high risk of cancer among type ABs was reported as early as the 1940s by the American Medical Association, although the scientific community didn’t pick up on this important discovery.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the first of many discoveries that will unfold, now that the link between blood types, immunity, diet, and disease has been uncovered. In my view, we owe an enormous debt to Dr. Peter D’Adamo and his father, who first developed the blood-type theory and published it in 1980. Dr. D’Adamo’s book <em>Eat Right for Your Type</em> is the place to start for those wanting to unravel the mysteries of the evolutionary code hidden in your blood type and what it means for you in terms of your ideal diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p class="indent">Be aware, however, that you are even more unique than your blood type. The best way to find out which foods suit you and which foods don’t is to have an allergy test (see Resources) that measures whether or not you produce specific antigens to specific foods. The dietary guidelines below, applicable to specific blood types, are just that—guidelines. By all means try them out. See how you feel. Many people find this way of eating works well for them. Others find that it makes little difference to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Also bear in mind that times and food have changed. If you were a type O back in the Stone Age, all that was available for you to eat was fit, organic meat, and you were not exposed to hormone-disrupting chemicals. Today, in the twenty-first century, most meat is from unfit animals, so it is fatty and contains undesirable chemical residues that overstimulate cell growth. Beans, on the other hand, were not an available food source back in the Stone Age, but do have protective effects against cancer. So, even if a “blood-type” diet has to be altered to fit the age we live in, it is one piece of the jigsaw of finding out your optimum nutrition.</p>
