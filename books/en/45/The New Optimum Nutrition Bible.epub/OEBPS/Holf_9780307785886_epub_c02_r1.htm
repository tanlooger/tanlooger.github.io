<h1 class="chapter2"><strong>Defining Optimum Nutrition</strong></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Most of us are unwitting students of the Breakfast Cereal School of Nutrition. Morning after morning we stare at the cereal package, reading, “… RDAs … one serving provides thiamine, riboflavin, niacin,” and, together with other clever advertising, this assures us that our reasonably well-balanced diet will give us everything we need. This is, however, the greatest lie in health care today—a belief based on wrong information and a complete misconception of the nature of the human body.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c02-s01"><strong>Human as machine</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">The concept of the body as a machine is a product of the thinking of philosophers such as Newton and Descartes and of the industrial revolution, which envisioned a clockwork universe and man as a thinking machine. Until a couple of hundred years ago, our ancestors had spent millions of years being hunter-gatherers and ten thousand years being peasant farmers, only to be propelled, as many country people were, into the new towns and cities to fuel the need for labor during the industrial revolution.</p>
<p class="indent">The diet that the new industrial workers were fed consisted of fat, sugar, and refined flour. A cookie or cake is a good example. Flour was refined so it would not support weevils and, like refined sugar and saturated fat, did not spoil. These cheap, energy-providing foods were considered “fuel” in the same way that a car needs gas. Not surprisingly, health declined. By about 1900, people had started to be smaller than in earlier generations. This led to the discovery of protein—the factor in food needed for growth. Sugar for energy, protein for muscle. With this concept, the Western diet of high sugar, fat, and protein was born.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page12"/>Yet people were still sick and, one by one, the classic vitamin-deficiency diseases such as scurvy and rickets were solved as new vitamins were discovered. The importance of minerals was also established, but all these vital nutrients were still dealt with in a very mechanical way. All each person needed was the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of each nutrient, a level considered to be sufficient to protect the body against deficiency diseases. Yet, according to Dr. Jeffrey Bland, world-renowned nutritional biochemist, former professor of chemistry, and founder of the Institute of Functional Medicine, “the RDAs have absolutely no relevance to individual nutritional assessment. They are standards of identity to meet the needs of practically all healthy people to prevent the known nutrition disorders beriberi, pellagra, scurvy, kwashiorkor, rickets, and marasmus. They have nothing to do with the common disorders of Western society.”</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c02-s02"><strong>Food, genes, environment, and disease</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Your body is composed entirely of molecules derived from food. In a lifetime, you will eat one hundred tons of food, which is broken down by enzyme-rich secretions in the digestive tract produced at a rate of about ten quarts per day. Macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrate) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) are absorbed through the digestive tract, whose health and integrity depends fundamentally on what you eat. Your nutritional status determines, to a substantial extent, your capacity to adapt and maintain health. Biochemical imbalances resulting from suboptimum nutrition experienced over generations are recorded and expressed genetically as strengths and weaknesses of specific body processes. Your genes express themselves in your environment (food, air, water, and so on). If your environment is too hostile for them, you cannot adapt and disease results. If your environment is nourishing, you have a greater resistance to disease and are more likely to experience health and vitality.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c02-s03"><strong>What does optimum nutrition mean?</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Optimum nutrition is, very simply, giving yourself the best possible intake of nutrients to allow your body to be as healthy as possible and to work as well as it can. It is not a set of rules. For example, you do not have to be vegetarian or take supplements or avoid eating any particular food, although for some people such advice would be appropriate. Your needs are completely unique and depend on a whole host of factors, from the strengths and weaknesses that you were born with right up to the effects that your current <a id="page13"/>environment has on you. You only have to look at the tremendous variation in the way we look, and in our talents and personalities, to realize that our nutritional needs are also not likely to be identical. No one diet is perfect for everyone, although there are general guidelines that apply to us all.</p>
<p class="indent">Your optimum nutrition is the intake of nutrients that:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Promotes your optimal mental performance and emotional balance</li>
<li>Promotes your optimal physical performance</li>
<li>Is associated with the lowest incidence of ill health</li>
<li>Is associated with the longest healthy life span</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To date, fifty nutrients have been identified as essential for health. Your health can be promoted and maintained at the highest level if you are able to achieve your optimal intake of each nutrient every single day. Gradually, your entire body, including your skeleton, is rebuilt and rejuvenated. Through optimum nutrition you can:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Improve mental clarity, mood, and concentration</li>
<li>Increase IQ</li>
<li>Increase physical performance</li>
<li>Improve quality of sleep</li>
<li>Improve resistance to infections</li>
<li>Protect yourself from disease</li>
<li>Extend your healthy life span</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">These might sound like bold claims, yet each has been proven by proper scientific research. Recently, I rang up two doctors who had been in general practice for many years before discovering the optimum nutrition approach. One told me, “I’m convinced that nutrition will be a major part of medicine in the foreseeable future. I’m getting substantially better results with diet and supplements than I used to with drugs.” The other, a general practitioner in Dublin, Ireland, said, “The evidence for nutritional therapy is becoming so strong that if the doctors of today don’t become nutritionists, the nutritionists will become the doctors of tomorrow.”</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c02-s04"><strong>Discover your optimum nutrition</strong></h2>
<p class="nonindent">Old-fashioned concepts of nutrition assess your needs by analyzing what you eat and comparing it with the RDA for each nutrient. This method is very basic, since RDAs do not exist for a number of key nutrients, have little relevance to what is needed for optimal health, and do not take into account individual variations in need or lifestyle factors that alter your needs, such as exposure to pollution, level of stress, or exercise.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="images/Holf_9780307785886_epub_002_r1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="figure"><a id="page14"/>Minerals preceded by a question mark are thought to be essential although studies have not yet confirmed this.</p>
<p class="indent">This book introduces you to the much more useful optimum daily allowances (ODAs) and enables you to assess your optimum nutrition using <a id="page15"/>three proven methods, each of which represents a piece of the jigsaw for calculating your needs. The more methods that can be used, the more effective will be the resultant nutritional plan. In addition, nutritional therapists have access to biochemical tests to find out more precisely what a person’s nutritional needs are. The three methods listed below also take into account four key principles—evolutionary dynamics, biochemical individuality, synergy, and environmental load—that are fundamental to the optimum nutrition approach and are explained in the following chapters.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c02-s04-s01"><em>Symptom analysis</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This enables you to see, from clusters of signs and symptoms (such as lack of energy, mouth ulcers, muscle cramps, easy bruising, poor dream recall, and so on) which nutrients you may be lacking.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c02-s04-s02"><em>Lifestyle analysis</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This helps you identify the factors in your life that change your nutritional needs (such as your level of exercise, stress, pollution, and so on).</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c02-s04-s03"><em>Dietary analysis</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">This compares your diet not with RDAs but with optimal levels of nutrients and takes into account your consumption of “antinutrients”—substances that rob the body of nutrients.</p>
