OMEGA-3 (EPA, DHA)


What it does Promotes a healthy heart, thins the blood. Reduces inflammation. Improves functioning of the nervous system. Promotes neurotransmitter balance and reception. Relieves depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit, hyperactivity, and autism. Improves sleep and skin condition, helps balance hormones, reduces insulin resistance.

Deficiency signs Dry skin, eczema, dry hair or dandruff, excessive thirst, excessive sweating, poor memory or learning difficulties, inflammatory health problems such as arthritis, high blood lipids, depression, PMS or breast pain, water retention.

How much?

RDA None established

ODA 350 mg of EPA, 350 mg of DHA

SUPPLEMENTARY RANGE EPA 150 to 550 mg, DHA 100 to 500 mg

TOXICITY None established. Substantial excess can lead to oily skin and loose bowels.

Best food sources Mackerel, swordfish, marlin, tuna, salmon, sardines, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds.

Best supplement While ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) is the actual essential nutrient found in seeds and nuts, from which EPA and DHA can be made in the body, EPA and DHA are a much more potent form of omega-3.

Helpers Niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, zinc, magnesium, and manganese help convert ALA to EPA/DHA and then prostaglandins. Antioxidant nutrients help to protect them.

Robbers Frying, storage, food processing such as hydrogenation, smoking, alcohol.





OMEGA-6 (GLA)


What it does Promotes a healthy heart, thins the blood. Reduces inflammation. Improves functioning of the nervous system. Promotes neurotransmitter balance and reception. Relieves depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit, hyperactivity, and autism. Improves skin condition, helps balance hormones, reduces insulin resistance.

Deficiency signs Dry skin, eczema, dry hair or dandruff, excessive thirst, excessive sweating, PMS or breast pain, water retention.

How much?

RDA None established

ODA 150 mg

TOXICITY None established. Substantial excess can lead to oily skin and loose bowels.

Best food sources Safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, wheat germ, sesame seeds.

Best supplement While linoleic acid is the actual essential nutrient found in seeds and nuts, from which GLA can be made in the body, GLA is a much more potent form of omega-6. This can also be converted to arachidonic acid, another very important essential fatty acid.

Helpers Niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, zinc, magnesium, and manganese help convert linoleic acid into GLA and then prostaglandins. Antioxidant nutrients help to protect them.

Robbers Frying, storage, food processing such as hydrogenation, smoking, alcohol.
