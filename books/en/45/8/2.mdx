How much?

RDA 1,000 mg

ODA 1,000 mg

SUPPLEMENTARY RANGE 0 to 400 mg

TOXICITY Problems of excessive calcium arise from other factors such as excessive vitamin D intake (above 25,000 IU per day). Excess will interfere with absorption of other minerals, especially if their intake is slightly low. May lead to calcification of kidneys, heart, and other soft tissue, for example, kidney stones.
