title: 22. Improving Your Digestion
---




Like all other animals, we spend our physical life processing organic matter and producing waste. How good we are at it determines our energy level, longevity, and state of body and mind. A lack of nutrients and the wrong kind of food can result in faulty digestion, faulty absorption, abnormal gut reactions including bloating and inflammation, gut infections, and poor elimination. The side effects disrupt every body system—immunity, the brain and nervous system, hormonal balance, and our ability to detoxify.





Stomach acid—the right balance


Digestion starts in the senses. The sight and smell of food initiate chemical reactions that get us ready to assimilate and digest food. Chewing is particularly important because messages are sent to the digestive tract to prepare different enzyme secretions according to what is in the mouth.

Food then passes into the stomach, where large proteins are broken down into smaller groups of amino acids. The first step in protein digestion is carried out by hydrochloric acid released from the stomach wall, which is dependent on zinc. Hydrochloric acid production often declines in old age, as do zinc levels. The consequence is indigestion, particularly noticeable after high-protein meals, and the likelihood of developing food allergies because undigested large food molecules are more likely to stimulate allergic reactions in the small intestine.

The nutritional solution for too little stomach acid is to take a digestive supplement containing betaine hydrochloride, plus at least 15 mg of zinc in an easily absorbable form such as zinc citrate. Some people, however, produce too much stomach acid, a possible cause of “acid stomach,” experienced as indigestion and a burning sensation. This is usually rectified by avoiding acid-forming and irritating foods and drinks: alcohol, coffee, tea, and aspirin all irritate the gut wall. Meat, fish, eggs, and other concentrated proteins stimulate acid production and can aggravate overacidity. The minerals calcium and magnesium are particularly alkaline and tend to have a calming effect on people suffering from excess acidity.



The digestive system.





Digestive enzymes


The stomach also produces a range of enzymes, collectively called proteases, to break down protein. Protein digestion continues in the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum, into which flow digestive enzymes produced in the pancreas and liver. The pancreas is the primary organ of digestion, and special cells in it produce enzymes for breaking down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These enzymes are called amylases, lipases, and, once again, proteases. Again, there are many different kinds.

The production of digestive enzymes depends on many micronutrients, especially vitamin B6. Suboptimum nutrition often results in suboptimum digestion, which in turn creates suboptimum absorption, so nutritional intake gets worse and worse. The consequence is undigested food in the small intestine, which encourages the proliferation of the wrong kind of bacteria and other microorganisms; symptoms can include flatulence, abdominal pain, and bloating.

The easiest way to correct this kind of problem is to take a broad-spectrum digestive enzyme supplement with each meal. This can make an immediate difference. You can test the effects of these enzyme supplements by crushing them and stirring them into a thick porridge made from oats and water. If the product is good, the porridge will become liquid in thirty minutes. While there is no harm in taking digestive enzymes on an ongoing basis, correcting their levels with supplements paves the way for increasing nutrient levels in the body. Once this is achieved, digestion often improves of its own accord and the supplements may no longer be necessary.

Before being digested, fat has to be specially prepared. This is achieved by a substance called bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile contains lecithin, which helps emulsify large fat particles and turn them into tiny particles with a greater surface area for the fat-splitting lipase enzyme to work on. Supplementing lecithin as granules or capsules improves emulsification and can help people with poor tolerance of fat—for instance, anyone who has had the gallbladder removed and therefore cannot store bile.



Digestive enzymes. Digestive enzymes, such as amylase, protease, or lipase, help turn large food molecules into tiny molecules that your digestive tract then allows to pass into the bloodstream.





Probiotics


Probiotics are your digestive tract’s best friend for a number of reasons. First, they help digest your food. Both proteins and fats can be broken down into amino acids and fatty acids by lactobacilli bacteria. The sugar in milk, lactose, is also broken down into glucose and galactose. This is especially helpful for those who are lactose-intolerant, lacking the digestive enzyme lactase that would normally do this. Probiotics also improve the absorption of calcium and other minerals; manufacture vitamins, primarily the vitamins K, B12, and folic acid; relieve constipation; and are important healers in a wide variety of digestive disorders.

Among these disorders are Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. In one study in Poland on irritable bowel syndrome, one hundred people were given lactobacilli, a placebo, or antispasmodic drugs.1 Three-quarters of those taking lactobacilli had significant improvement, compared with 27 percent taking the drug and 0 percent taking the placebo. Twenty-two patients who had no relief on the drug were then given probiotics plus the drug. Seventy-seven percent reported improvement. Clearly probiotics were much more effective than antispasmodic drugs. It has been estimated that about half of all people diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome have abnormal bacteria balance and therefore are likely to benefit from probiotics.2

Inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have also been proven to respond favorably to probiotics. Lactobacillus salivarius, a strain of lactobacilli, has proven particularly effective for colitis sufferers. One of the ways in which probiotics may help is by promoting healing and repair of the digestive tract. When the digestive tract is inflamed, perhaps owing to these diseases, infection, or irritation by alcohol, painkillers, or antibiotics, it can become abnormally permeable, which is a major cause of the development of food allergies and detoxification problems. This sequence of events can also cause other inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, which has also been shown to benefit from probiotics.3 The digestive tract can be restored to health by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are naturally produced by lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and eubacteria. (Eubacteria are generally not used as probiotics because supplementation makes little difference to their numbers in the gut.)

The most proven benefit of probiotics is in cases of diarrhea, especially those brought on by bacterial infections. In most cases, provided the right strain of bacteria at the right strength is used, probiotics can halve recovery time from a bout of diarrhea. Hence, probiotics are an exotic traveler’s best friend.

If you suffer from food allergies, the chances are probiotics will help you too. Many food reactions may not be solely due to food allergy, but may also be due to the feeding of unfriendly bacteria, which then produce substances that activate the immune system in the gut.4 Probiotics have been shown to help reduce inflammatory reactions in food allergies by lessening the response in the gut to allergenic foods.5 (There’s more on probiotics in chapter 17.)





Gut reactions


While indigestion can be caused by a lack or excess of stomach acid, a lack of digestive enzymes, or a lack of probiotics, these are not the only possibilities. Many of the foods we eat irritate and damage our very sensitive and vitally important interface with the inside world. One such food is wheat, in which a protein called gluten contains gliadin, a known intestinal irritant. A small amount may be tolerated, but most people in the U.S. consume wheat in the form of crackers, toast, bread, cereals, cakes, pastry, and pasta at least three times a day. Modern wheat is very high in gluten, and baking increases its ability to react with the gut wall. In cases of severe gluten sensitivity, the villi, tiny protrusions that make up the small intestine, get completely worn away. For those with gluten sensitivity, all foods containing gluten must be avoided. Rice, corn, quinoa, and buckwheat are fine, as all are gluten-free.





Gut infections


The best way to get a gut infection is to eat plenty of sugar, suffer from indigestion, and have regular courses of antibiotics. There are around three hundred different strains of bacteria in the gut, most of which are essential. They protect us from harmful bacteria, viruses, and other dangerous organisms.

Antibiotics wipe out all the bacteria in the body, good as well as bad, and are best not taken unless absolutely necessary. If the gut contains the wrong kind of bacteria, or perhaps an overgrowth of a yeastlike organism called Candida albicans, a high-sugar diet, including fruit, can exacerbate the problem. Feelings of intoxication, drowsiness, and bloating after consuming sugar are good indicators of a potential imbalance. In the same way yeast ferments sugar to produce alcohol, it is possible to check for the presence of yeastlike organisms by testing the blood, eating sugar, and then testing the blood again for the presence of alcohol.

A number of powerful natural remedies have been proven to help with gut infections. Caprylic acid, extracted from coconuts, and olive leaf extract are both powerful antifungal agents. Grapefruit seed extract, taken as drops in water, is antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial, but does not destroy all the essential strains of bacteria. Even so, it is best not taken with meals. Another remedy, probiotics (see this page), aims to improve the strength of the beneficial bacteria in the gut. This is easily achieved by short (one-month) courses of supplements. Since bacteria are fragile, it is best to choose a high-quality product containing acidophilus and bifidobacteria bacteria.





Preventing gas and constipation


Indigestion is a cause of gas, as is eating foods that contain indigestible carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are found particularly in beans and vegetables. The enzyme alpha-galactosidase (sometimes called glucoamylase) breaks down these indigestible carbohydrates and reduces flatulence and is found in better digestive enzyme supplements.

Constipation has many causes, the most common of which is hard fecal matter. Natural foods stay soft in the digestive tract because they contain fibers that absorb water and expand. Fruit and vegetables naturally contain a lot of water. Provided they are prepared properly, whole grains such as oats and rice absorb water and provide soft, moist bulk for the digestive tract. Meats, cheese, eggs, refined grains, and wheat (because of its gluten content) are all constipating. While it should not be necessary to add fiber to the diet, oat fiber has particular benefits in that it has been shown to help eliminate excess cholesterol and slow down carbohydrate uptake, as well as prevent constipation. It is naturally present in oats, which are best soaked and eaten cold.

Some foods and nutrients exert a mild laxative effect. These include flaxseeds, which can be ground and sprinkled on food; prunes; and vitamin C in doses of several grams. But most laxatives, even natural ones, are gastrointestinal irritants and, although they work, they do not solve the underlying issue. A new kind of laxative, fructo-oligosaccharides, supplied in powder form, is a complex carbohydrate that helps keep moisture in the gut and stimulates production of healthy lactic acid bacteria. While the results are not quite so rapid, this is a far preferable way of dealing with constipation. Eating plenty of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, plus drinking lots of water, is essential as well.

For some people, long-term constipation can result in physical blockages and distension of the bowel. Dietary changes help but are not always enough to clean out the intestinal tract. A combination of particular fibers, such as psyllium husks, beet fiber, oat fiber, and herbs, will assist in loosening up old fecal material. These are available via colon-cleansing formulas consisting of powders and capsules to be taken over a one- to three-month period. Another helpful treatment is colonic therapy: water is passed into the bowel by enema under pressure and this, together with abdominal massage, helps release and remove old fecal material. Exercise that stimulates the abdominal area also helps improve digestion, as do breathing exercises that relax the abdomen. It is a natural reflex of the body to stop digesting in times of stress.

Improving digestion is the cornerstone to good health. Energy levels improve, the skin becomes softer and clearer, body odor is reduced, and the immune system is strengthened. The trick is to work from the top down, first ensuring good digestion, then good absorption, and finally good elimination. If you have any specific digestive difficulties, the best person to see is a nutrition consultant. With current testing methods and recent advances in natural treatments, most digestive problems can be solved with relative ease, little expense, and no need for invasive tests or treatment.
