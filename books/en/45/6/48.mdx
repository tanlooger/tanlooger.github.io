title: 48. Choosing the Best Supplements
---




While the golden rule of any supplement program is to work out the right doses and take them regularly, there are many other issues to consider when choosing supplements. Is it better to have natural rather than synthetic nutrients? Are capsules better than tablets? Are certain forms of minerals better absorbed? Are there good and bad combinations? What if you are on medication—are there any situations when you should not take supplements?





Capsules versus tablets


Capsules always used to be made of gelatin, which is an animal product and therefore not suitable for strict vegetarians. However, thanks to technological advances there are now capsules made from vegetable cellulose. The advantage of tablets is that, through compression, you can get more nutrients into them. The disadvantage is the need for fillers and binders. Some people think capsules allow for better nutrient absorption; however, provided the tablet is properly made, there is little difference, even if you have poor digestion. Most vitamins, including the oil-based ones, can be provided in tablet form. For instance, natural vitamin E comes in two forms: d-alpha tocopherol acetate (oil) and d-alpha tocopherol succinate (powder). They are equally potent.





Natural versus synthetic


A great deal of nonsense has been said and written about the advantages of natural vitamins. First of all, many products that claim to be natural are simply not. By law, a certain percentage of a product must be natural before the product can be declared “natural” on its label. The percentage varies from country to country. Through careful wording some supplements are made to sound natural when they are not. For instance, “vitamin C with rosehips” invariably means synthetic vitamin C with added rosehips, although it is often confused with vitamin C from rosehips. So which is better?

By definition, a synthetic vitamin must contain all the properties of the vitamin found in nature. If it does not, the chemists have not done their job properly. This is the case with vitamin E. Natural d-alpha tocopherol succinate is 36 percent more potent than the synthetic vitamin E called d1-alpha tocopherol (in this case the “1” dictates the chemical difference). So natural vitamin E, usually derived from wheat germ or soybean oil, is better.

However, synthetic vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has the same biological potency as the natural substance, according to Dr. Linus Pauling, although advanced scientific techniques have shown visible differences between the two. No one has yet shown that natural vitamin C is more potent or more beneficial to take. Indeed, most vitamin C is synthesized from a “natural” sugar such as dextrose; two chemical reactions later you have ascorbic acid. This is little different from the chemical reactions that take place in animals that convert sugar to vitamin C. Vitamin C derived from, say, acerola cherries—the most concentrated source—is also considerably bulkier and more expensive. Acerola is only 20 percent vitamin C, so a 1,000 mg tablet would be five times as large as a normal tablet and would cost you ten times as much!

It is true that vitamins derived from natural sources may contain unknown elements that increase their potency. Vitamin E or d-alpha tocopherol is found with beta, gamma, and delta tocopherol, and the inclusion of these with a measured amount of d-alpha tocopherol may be of benefit. Vitamin C is found in nature together with the bioflavonoids, active nutrients that appear to increase its potency, particularly its capacity for strengthening tiny blood vessels. Good sources of bioflavonoids are berries and citrus fruit, so the addition of citrus bioflavonoids or berry extracts to vitamin C tablets is one step closer to nature.

It is possible that yeast and rice bran, which are excellent sources of B vitamins, also contain unknown beneficial ingredients, so these vitamins are best supplied with yeast or rice bran. Brewer’s yeast tablets or powder are far less efficient ways of taking B vitamins than B complex vitamin supplements with a little added yeast—one would have to eat pounds of yeast tablets to get optimum levels of B vitamins. However, some people are allergic to yeast, and if you react badly to any supplements, it could be yeast that is the problem. For this reason, many supplements are yeast free.

There are many other potentially helpful substances that may be provided with nutrients in a complex. Included here are substances called coenzymes, which help to convert the nutrient into its active form. vitamin B6 needs to be converted from pyridoxine to pyridoxal-5-phosphate before it becomes active in the body. This process requires zinc and magnesium, which are now included in a number of B6 supplements. Supplements of pyridoxal-5-phosphate are also available and should, theoretically, be more usable. Time will tell how much of an advantage these innovations will prove. But the key point is to make sure you get enough of each of the essential nutrients.





Vitamin and mineral absorption


Vitamins and particularly minerals come in different forms which affect their absorption and availability. Apart from the form of the nutrient, there are dietary and lifestyle factors that help or hinder their availability to the body.

WATER-SOLUBLE NUTRIENTS



FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS



MINERALS





Mineral bioavailability


Most of the minerals essential for health are supplied from food to the body as a compound bound to a larger (food) molecule. This binding is known as chelation, from the Greek word chele, meaning “claw.” Some form of chelation is important, since most essential minerals in their “raw” state have a slight positive electrical charge. The gut wall is slightly negatively charged, so once separated from food through the process of digestion, these unbound minerals would become loosely bound to the gut wall. Instead of being absorbed, these minerals would easily become bound to undesirable substances like the phytic acid in bran, the tannic acid in tea, oxalic acid, and so on—these acids would remove the mineral from the body.

Bioavailability of a mineral, which is defined as the proportion that can be utilized, depends on many factors, including the amount of “enhancers” and “inhibitors” present, such as phytates, other minerals, and vitamins, as well as the acidity of the digestive environment. Most minerals are absorbed in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, assisted by the presence of stomach acid.

In supplements, minerals are bound, or chelated, to different compounds to help their absorption. Amino acid–chelated minerals are bound to amino acids, examples of which are chromium picolinate and selenocysteine or zinc amino acid chelate. These are well absorbed, as are other “organic” compounds including citrates, gluconates, and aspartates. Inorganic compounds such as carbonates, sulfates, and oxides are less well absorbed.

For some minerals, the extra cost of amino acid–chelated minerals outweighs the advantage. For example, magnesium amino acid chelate is only twice as well absorbed as magnesium carbonate, an inexpensive source of magnesium. Iron amino acid chelate, on the other hand, is four times better absorbed, making the price differential worth it. Generally speaking, the following forms are most readily available to the body, listed in decreasing order of their bioavailability (that is, the very best first).

Calcium: Amino acid chelate, ascorbate, citrate, gluconate, carbonate

Magnesium: Amino acid chelate, ascorbate, citrate, gluconate, carbonate

Iron: Amino acid chelate, ascorbate, citrate, gluconate, sulfate, oxide

Zinc: Picolinate, amino acid chelate, ascorbate, citrate, gluconate, sulfate

Manganese: Amino acid chelate, ascorbate, citrate, gluconate

Selenium: Selenocysteine or selenomethionine, sodium selenite

Chromium: Picolinate, polynicotinate, ascorbate, gluconate





What about sustained release?


Some vitamins are called prolonged, sustained, or time released, implying that the ingredients are not all made available for absorption in one go. This can be useful when taking large amounts of water-soluble vitamins such as B complex or vitamin C. However, absorption depends also on the person and the dosage. Some people are able to absorb and use 1,000 mg of vitamin C taken in one dose; taking it in sustained-release form would provide little benefit. However, if you take three 1,000 mg tablets a day, sustained release would allow you to take them all in one go. Since sustained-release vitamins are more expensive, you have to weigh up the pros and cons. And there is no point in having a sustained-release fat-soluble vitamin, such as A, D, or E, as these can be stored in the body.

The best sustained-release products are capsules containing tiny “beads,” each containing the desired nutrients, which dissolve at different rates and so release the nutrients over time. This method, however, consumes a lot of space, so the dose is not usually very high, making the necessity for sustained release less relevant.





What about food form?


A critical question is, Do vitamins and minerals in food work better than those in supplements? Some companies sell “food-form” vitamins and minerals and claim they absorb better into the body. These food-form supplements are made by feeding nutrients to yeast, having the yeast ferment and incorporate the nutrient into its food matrix, then killing off the yeast by a combination of heat and enzymes from pineapple and papaya. This ensures there are no yeast cells left and hence no adverse effects for those sensitive to yeast.

While the research to date, which has looked at the ability of supplements to raise body levels of nutrients, appears to be positive, there is still much to be done to find out what exactly makes food-form nutrients more bioavailable and also to prove the extent to which they work better in promoting health. The answer is bound to be as complex as nature herself.

In nature, nutrients are bound in a complex way to peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, and so on. When we eat, the high acid content of the stomach, plus enzymes, breaks down these bonds to liberate the nutrients. The nutrients then have to be reassembled into forms that can be transported and used by the body. It looks as if the complex way food incorporates nutrients, which is what the food-form process mimics, allows the nutrients to be more easily released, transported, and used.

Given that we have evolved over millions of years to use the nutrients available to us in foods, it certainly makes good sense to provide nutrients in supplements in a form a close as possible to that found in nature. That said, a nutrient in the form found in food may not in all cases be better for you than that in a supplement. Taking folic acid supplements, for example, has been well proven to be twice as effective in raising blood levels of folic acid and lowering homocysteine as eating the equivalent amount of folate in food.





Good and bad combinations


The general rule is to take supplements with food. This is primarily because the presence of stomach acid helps many minerals to be absorbed and because the fat-soluble vitamins are carried by the fats or oils present in most meals. Nutrients do, however, compete for absorption. For example, if you want to absorb a large amount of a specific amino acid such as lysine (good for the arteries and for preventing herpes), more will be absorbed if you take it on an empty stomach or with nonprotein foods such as a piece of fruit. Similarly, a tiny mineral like selenium will be absorbed better on its own than as part of a multimineral.

However, no one wants to end up taking each supplement separately. So unless you have a specific need or deficiency and want to maximize absorption by taking the nutrient on its own, spread your nutrients out through the day and take them with meals as nature intended.

There is, however, always one exception. If you want to take the alkaline-forming “ascorbate” type of vitamin C in quite large doses (3 grams or more a day), take it away from meals to avoid neutralizing the acidity in your stomach. If you ever experience a burning sensation after taking vitamin C as ascorbic acid (a weak acid), you may have some gastrointestinal irritation or even an ulcer. See your doctor and have this possibility checked out. While vitamin C helps heal wounds, the acid form can aggravate an existing problem and should be avoided.





Drug-nutrient interactions: difficulties and dangers


There are very few dangerous drug-nutrient interactions. However, there are many drugs that interfere with the action of nutrients, increasing your need.

Aspirin increases the need for vitamin C.

Birth control pills and HRT increase the need for B6, B12, folic acid, and zinc.

Antibiotics increase the need for B vitamins and beneficial bacteria.

Acetaminophen increases the need for antioxidants.



Here are details of some potentially dangerous combinations that must be avoided:

Coumadin (a blood-thinning drug), aspirin, vitamin E, and high-EPA/DHA fish oils all thin the blood, and the combined effect would be too much. It is better to reduce the drugs and increase the nutrients, but first check with your doctor.

When taking MAOI antidepressants (such as Nardil or Parnate) you must avoid yeast (including supplements), alcohol, and certain specific foods.

Some anticonvulsants are antifolate, creating an increased need for folic acid, yet supplementation can impair the action of the drug. Specialist advice from your doctor and nutrition consultant is recommended. Epileptics should be careful about supplementing the brain nutrient DMAE.

In cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, supplementing folic acid can reduce the symptoms while the underlying deficiency gets worse. Therefore, it is best to supplement both nutrients, preferably as part of a B complex.





Do’s and don’ts of supplement-taking


Very few problems occur with vitamin supplements, but it is sensible to be aware of the following:

Vitamin A (retinol) in doses in excess of 8,250 IU should not be taken by pregnant women or women trying to conceive. Check that the total provided by all your supplements (for example, a multivitamin or antioxidant complex) does not exceed this level.

Beta-carotene in excess makes your skin go very yellow. If you have excessively yellowing skin, check your beta-carotene intake from food and supplements. This is quite different from jaundice or hepatitis, in which the whites of your eyes go yellow. Also, don’t supplement beta-carotene on its own if you are a smoker. Take it as part of an all-round antioxidant complex.

vitamin B2 (riboflavin) makes your urine bright yellow. This is normal.

vitamin B3 in the form of niacin, usually in doses of 100 mg or more, can make you flush and go red, hot, and itchy for up to thirty minutes. This is normal and is not an allergy. While the nutrient is beneficial, if you do not like this side effect, take less or else take half the dose twice a day. Your flushing potential will reduce with regular supplementation. (Alternatively, buy the “no-flush” type of niacin.)

Vitamin C has a laxative effect in very high doses, normally above 5 grams a day. A small number of people are very sensitive even at 1 gram a day, while others can tolerate 10 grams a day. The ideal level is the “bowel-tolerance” level, so adjust your intake accordingly.

Copper is an essential mineral but it is toxic. Do not take supplements containing copper unless they contain at least ten to fifteen times as much zinc. So, for example, if there is 1 mg of copper, make sure there is 10 to 15 mg of zinc. This will prevent copper accumulation. Conversely, zinc is an antagonist of copper, so don’t take large amounts of zinc without adding a little copper.





Value for money


For a supplement to be good value, it must be well made, well formulated, and well priced. The quality of manufacture is hard to assess unless you have an advanced chemistry laboratory in your back room! However, there are four simple tests you can do:





Is the stated number of tablets actually in the bottle? (When we tested one manufacturer’s product at ION, we found an average of ninety-five tablets instead of a hundred.)

Is the tablet coated all around and therefore easy to swallow? (Uncoated or badly coated tablets can break up or taste unpleasant.)

Does the label tell you everything you need to know? (The better the company, the more information it will want to give you.)

Does the company emphasize its quality control and, if asked, can it supply you with independent analyses of its products?



If you are buying fish oil supplements, make sure the company emphasizes the purity of its fish oils. Good products are free from residues of mercury or PCBs and other undesirable pollutants found in fish. Less expensive supplements often come out badly on independent analysis.
