title: 45. Your Optimum Supplement Program
---




Your personal nutritional needs can be calculated by looking at your lifestyle and identifying signs and symptoms associated with various deficiencies. In the sections that follow, answer the questions as best you can, then for each nutrient work out your score out of ten. If you score five or more, the chances are that you do not have the optimal intake of that nutrient, given your current needs. The second part of this chapter shows you how to turn these scores into your optimum supplement program. You can also do this by having an online My Nutrition assessment (see Resources) that will calculate your own personal diet and supplement program.





Optimum Nutrition Questionnaire


SYMPTOM ANALYSIS

For each symptom that you experience often, score 1 point. Many symptoms occur more than once, because they can be the result of many nutrient deficiencies. If you experience any of the symptoms in bold type, score 2 points. The maximum score for each nutrient is 10 points. Put your score for each nutrient in the box.

LIFESTYLE ANALYSIS

The following checks allow you to adjust your nutrient needs according to aspects of your health and lifestyle. Again, answer the questions as best you can and work out your score. In most checks, the maximum score is 10, scoring 1 point for each yes answer unless otherwise specified. If you score 5 or more in any category, you will need to add the points shown in the chart on this page to your individual nutrient scores. The easiest way to do this is to circle all the numbers in the corresponding columns on this page. For example, if you score more than 5 on the energy check, you would circle all the numbers in the energy column on this page. Some checks are either yes or no. If you answer yes, circle the numbers in the relevant columns on this page.

Energy Check



___Do you need more than eight hours’ sleep a night?

___Are you rarely wide awake and raring to go within twenty minutes of rising?

___Do you need something to get you going in the morning, like a cup of tea or coffee or a cigarette?

___Do you have tea, coffee, or sugar-containing foods or drinks, or smoke cigarettes, at regular intervals during the day?

If any of your ‘lifestyle scores’ are 5 or more (eg if Energy is 6 and Immune Check is 6) highlight those columns on this page, if you are 14–16 or over 50 highlight the appropriate columns for these as well. Now add across for each nutrient BOTH your Symptom Score AND any scores in the highlighted columns (eg Energy Immune and over 50 columns) to arrive at your Total Score for each nutrient.





How to work out your optimum nutrient needs


From the Symptom Analysis section of the Optimum Nutrition Questionnaire, you will have arrived at your basic score for each nutrient, which then needs to be adjusted depending on your answers to the Lifestyle Analysis questions. To do this, add all the numbers you have circled to your symptom score. Do this for each row, entering each total in the first column on this page, headed Your Total Score. The higher your score for any given nutrient, the greater your need for that nutrient.

Once you have arrived at your score for each nutrient, you can work out your supplement needs by looking at the column that corresponds to your score in the chart on this page. For example, if your vitamin C score was 6, your estimated ideal supplementary intake of this vitamin is 1,600 mg per day. Now work out your own supplemental levels for each nutrient.

If you score 0 to 4 on any nutrient, I still recommend that you supplement it on a basic level, which can easily be achieved with a good daily multivitamin and mineral supplement. Remember: These levels are your supplementary needs, not your overall needs including what you should get from your diet. I have assumed that you have improved your diet—or will do so—so that it provides a basic intake of these nutrients. You will not get the same results from adding supplements to a poor diet.

For example, the ideal daily intake of calcium is 800 to 1,200 mg (if needs are high, as for pregnant women or elderly people). The average intake is around 900 mg. If you have a dairy-free diet but eat seeds, you should still be able to achieve at least 800 mg. So, if you have no symptoms or lifestyle factors that increase your need, you don’t need to supplement extra. If, on the other hand, you are pregnant, your supplemental requirement is 1,200 − 800 = 400 mg. This is why the range given for supplementation on this page goes from zero up to 400 mg.

Levels of minerals other than those in the chart are generally sufficient in most people’s diets and can be increased through dietary changes. Potassium, which balances sodium (salt), is best supplied by eating plenty of raw fruit and vegetables. Phosphorus deficiency is exceedingly rare, and the mineral is contained in almost all supplements as calcium phosphate. Iodine deficiency is also extremely rare. Copper is frequently oversupplied in our diets and can be toxic. A whole-food diet almost always contains enough copper.





Scores for children


For children under the age of fourteen, there is a simple method for adjusting the nutrient-need figures (which are based on adult requirements). Take the weight of the child in pounds and divide by 100. (Alternatively, take the weight of the child in kilograms and divide by 50.) Now multiply this number by the adult supplemental levels in the chart to give you the child’s actual supplemental levels. For example, if a child weighs 50 lb. and we divide that by 100, we get 0.5. If the child scored 6 for vitamin C, giving a supplemental level of 2,000 mg, we would multiply by 0.5 and get 1,000 mg. This is the child’s approximate optimal intake of vitamin C.

Alternatively, use the guide to optimal supplement intakes for children up to the age of eleven on this page. From fourteen onward, adult levels can be given.





Planning your ideal supplement program


In case you are wondering, it is not necessary to take thirty different supplements every day! Your needs can be compressed into four or five different supplements, each combining the nutrients above. The most common combinations are a multivitamin (containing vitamins A, B, C, D, and E) and a multimineral for all the minerals. Vitamin C is usually taken separately, since the basic optimum requirement of 1,000 mg (l g) makes quite a large tablet without the addition of any more nutrients.

Choosing the right formula is an art in itself. Chapter 46 helps you through the maze by showing you how to decipher the small print and read between the lines, while chapter 47 explains how to devise a simple daily routine of vitamin supplements. Alternatively, you can walk into your local health food store, show the product adviser your calculations of your personal requirements and ask for help designing a supplement program that meets your needs.
