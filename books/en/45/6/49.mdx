title: 49. Vitamins and Minerals — How Much Is Safe?
---




Just how safe are supplements? What happens if you take more vitamins or minerals than you need? How much is too much? These are common concerns, fueled by media reports linking vitamin C with kidney stones and warnings against vitamin A in pregnancy. How much is fact and how much is fiction?

The optimal intake of a nutrient varies considerably for each individual, depending on age, sex, health, and numerous other factors. It is therefore to be expected that the level that would induce signs of toxicity also varies considerably. When certain illnesses are present, a person’s need for a vitamin can increase dramatically: vitamin C is the prime example, when you are fighting an infection. In this chapter, I have erred on the side of caution by listing the levels of nutrients that may induce toxicity in a small percentage of people, if taken both over a short period (up to one month) and over a long period (three months to three years), indicating which symptoms persist and which go away once the high level is reduced.

It is important to realize that just about everything is toxic if the dose is high enough. In 1990, a man died as a result of drinking 10 quarts of water in two hours. So the critical question is, How much more of the substance than is normally consumed do you need to consume to reach toxic levels? In other words, what is the safety margin?





The safety of vitamins


The general conclusion from a survey we conducted at the Institute for Optimum Nutrition of the results of over one hundred research papers in scientific journals is that for the majority of vitamins, with the exception of A and D, levels one hundred times greater than the recommended daily allowance (RDA) are likely to be safe for long-term ingestion.1 Two recent comprehensive reviews broadly support this position.2

In practical terms, this means that the chances of having a toxic reaction to even the higher-dose supplements available in health food shops is extremely unlikely unless you take considerably more tablets than recommended. This is consistent with the public health record of deaths attributed to nutritional supplements. To date, no one has been reported as dying as a result of a vitamin supplement. Very rarely there are deaths due to children’s swallowing handfuls of their mother’s sugar-coated iron supplements. Compare this with deaths attributed to prescribed drugs. These were the conclusions of a survey of hospitalized patients, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: “We estimated that in 1994 overall 2,216,000 hospitalized patients had serious adverse drug reactions and 106,000 had fatal adverse drug reactions, making these reactions between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death.”3 Similar findings have also been reported in Britain.4

In the table on the next page, you can see that you are more than one hundred thousand times more likely to die from a highly preventable medical injury, including prescribed drugs, than you are from a dietary supplement. Death, however, is a rather severe yardstick. What about toxicity or adverse effects? These too are extremely uncommon in relation to nutritional supplements. In nearly twenty years of practice, teaching, and writing, I have yet to come across a single case of actual toxicity.





Vitamin A


Vitamin A comes in two forms: the animal form, retinol, which is stored in the body; and the vegetable form, beta-carotene, which is converted into retinol unless body levels are already high. Beta-carotene is therefore not considered toxic, with the exceptions that excessive intake can cause a reversible yellowing of the skin and that there is possibly an increased cancer risk, only for smokers, if it is supplemented on its own.

There have been a number of incidences of adverse reactions to retinol, usually from intakes of 495,000 IU or more over a considerable length of time. The symptoms include peeling and redness of the skin, disturbed hair growth, lack of appetite, and vomiting. According to Dr. John Marks, medical director at Girton College, Cambridge (England), “toxic reactions have been extremely rare below 30,000 IUs (10,000 mcg) … daily administration in adults up to about 50,000 IUs (17,000 mcg) would appear to be safe.” This is consistent with estimates of the intake of 50,000 IU of vitamin A that our ancestors would have eaten in a more tropical environment, although a large part of this would have come from beta-carotene.



Relative risk of death from dietary supplements versus medical treatment This assessment of risk, from Australia, shows that if the risk of dying from a natural or dietary supplement is 1, your risk of dying from a shark attack is 6, of being murdered 828, and of dying from a highly preventable medical injury, including an adverse drug reaction, more than 100,000 times higher!5

A number of cases of toxicity and birth defects have been reported for a synthetic relative of vitamin A, isotretinoin, sold as the drug Accutane. These effects have been wrongly extended to natural vitamin A. Five cases of birth defects have been reported in babies born to women taking large amounts of retinol (247,500 to 495,000 IU per day); however, no clear cause-and-effect relationship has ever been established in any of these cases.

One study published in 1995 found a possible association: in a group of 22,747 women, 121 gave birth to children with the kind of defect associated with, among other things, vitamin A toxicity. Of these 121, two of the cases could have been attributable to supplementing in excess of 10,890 IU of vitamin A in the form of retinol. In view of the possibility that large amounts of retinol could induce birth defects, it is wise for women of childbearing age to take no more than 10,890 IU of retinol in supplemental form. (Other studies have shown that women who supplement their diet with multivitamins including vitamin A, usually at a level of 8,250 to 24,750 IU, have a lower incidence of defects in their babies.)

The same caution as for retinol does not apply to beta-carotene. This has, however, been shown to slightly increase the risk of lung cancer and colon cancer if given in isolation to smokers. My advice here is to stop smoking and, if you don’t stop, supplement beta-carotene only as part of a multivitamin or antioxidant complex. Beta-carotene in food reduces the risk of cancer even for smokers.





Vitamin D


Of all the vitamins, D is the most likely to cause toxic reactions. It encourages calcium absorption, and excessive intake can lead to calcification of soft tissue. However, the levels that create this effect are certainly in excess of 120,000 IU and probably more like 600,000 IU. A daily intake not exceeding 264,000 IU for adults and 13,000 IU for children is generally considered safe.





Vitamin E


Vitamin E has been well researched for toxicity. A review of 216 trials of high-dose vitamin E in ten thousand people showed that daily doses of 3,000 IU for up to eleven years and 52,500 IU for a few months had no detrimental effect. However, adverse reactions have occasionally been reported at lower levels of 1,950 IU, especially in children, possibly due to an allergic reaction to the source of the vitamin E.

Vitamin E appears to increase the anticlotting effects of the drug Coumadin, and therefore high levels are not recommended for those on Coumadin. High levels are also best avoided by people suffering from rheumatic fever. Some old reports that vitamin E should not be taken in supplement form by women with breast cancer are inaccurate: it is highly beneficial to do so. A daily intake of up to 1,500 IU is considered safe.





Vitamin C


Vitamin C is water soluble and therefore excess is readily excreted from the body. Government recommendations vary considerably from country to country A general consensus based on up-to-date research is that 100 mg a day represents a good basic intake; the optimal intake is probably between 1,000 and 3,000 mg a day.

A number of studies have investigated the effects of vitamin C on specific diseases, using over 10,000 mg a day. The recommendation of these high levels has attracted controversy and allegations that vitamin C can cause kidney stone formation, interferes with B12 absorption, and causes a “rebound scurvy” when supplementation is stopped. All these allegations have been shown to be without substance. The only drawback to taking large amounts of vitamin C is that it can have a laxative effect. Generally, supplementing up to 5,000 mg of vitamin C a day can be considered safe.





Vitamin B


The B vitamins are water soluble and excess is readily excreted from the body in the urine, so they are generally of very low toxicity. Thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), pantothenic acid (B5), B12, and biotin show no sign of toxicity at levels of at least one hundred times the U.S. RDA. vitamin B3 in the form of niacin causes blushing at levels of 75 mg or more; this is part of its natural action and therefore is not generally considered to be a toxic effect.

According to Dr. John Marks at Girton College, Cambridge, “doses of 200 mg to 10 g daily have been used therapeutically to lower blood cholesterol levels under medical control for periods of up to ten years or more, and though some reactions have occurred at these very high dosages, they have rapidly responded to cessation of therapy, and have often cleared even when therapy has been continued.” Levels of up to 2,000 mg per day on a continuous basis are considered safe.

Vitamin B6 has been extensively tested for toxicity by a number of research groups including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which concluded that “in man, side effects were not encountered with daily administration of 50 to 200 mg over periods of months.” Most of the unfounded reports of low-dose B6 causing nerve damage appear to be based on one well-documented case of a woman who increased her B6 intake from supplements of 500 mg to 5,000 mg over a period of two years and developed muscle weakness and pain that were attributed to nerve damage.

One researcher, investigating seven cases of people taking 2,000 to 5,000 mg of B6 a day for considerable lengths of time, said that “substantial improvement occurred in all cases in the months after withdrawal of pyridoxine, usually with improvement in gait and less discomfort in the extremities, but in some patients, residual neurological discomfort remained.” In rats, daily injected doses of 600 mg/kg, equivalent to 3,800 mg a day in a person weighing 140 pounds, caused peripheral neuropathy, with tingling and numbing of the hands and feet.

Deficiency of vitamin B6 induces the same symptoms. The likely explanation is that, in order to become active in the body where it helps enzymes to work, pyridoxine must be converted to pyridoxal phosphate. If the body is saturated with excessive pyridoxine, this conversion does not take place: enzymes become saturated with simple pyridoxine and so do not work properly. So B6 excess may, in fact, induce what are effectively B6-deficiency symptoms. Since zinc is required for the conversion of pyridoxine to pyridoxal phosphate, taking B6 with zinc is likely to reduce its toxicity. In any event, a daily intake of up to 200 mg on a continuous basis is generally considered safe.





The safety of minerals


The safety of minerals depends on three factors: the amount, the form, and the balance with other minerals in the diet. First, all minerals show toxicity at exceedingly high doses. Where form is concerned, trivalent chromium, for example, is essential, while hexavalent chromium (found in neither foods nor supplements) is very toxic. And as for balance, iron supplementation can exacerbate zinc deficiency since it is a zinc antagonist. The reason for such antagonism is that the shape of the atoms of many minerals is very similar. They are really just different sizes of cogs, so if you lack one mineral but take in an excess of a similar-shaped one, it can slot into the wrong enzyme, speeding it up, slowing it down, or simply stopping it from working altogether.

In view of these factors, the levels given in the following pages as safe for long-term consumption presuppose that other essential minerals are also adequately supplied. Larger amounts than those stated may also be safe for short-term use, particularly for people with certain illnesses that result in an extra requirement for a mineral. Selenium requirement, for example, is thought to increase in certain types of cancer.





Calcium


The best-absorbed of calcium’s many forms include calcium ascorbate, amino acid chelate, gluconate, orotate, and carbonate. In normal, healthy people, there is little danger of toxicity since the body excretes excessive amounts. In some cultures, people consume in excess of 2 g a day from their diet alone, so this amount is certainly considered safe. Calcium-deficiency disorders are treated with 3.6 g per day.

Problems of excessive calcium arise from other factors, such as excessive vitamin D intake (above 25,000 IUs per day) or parathyroid or kidney disorders. Calcium interacts with magnesium and phosphorus, so calcium supplementation should be given only to people with adequate magnesium and phosphorus intake or supplementing these elements. Phosphorus is rarely deficient, while magnesium deficiency is quite common. The ideal calcium to phosphorus ratio is probably 1:1. Less than 1:2 is not desirable. The ideal calcium to magnesium ratio is probably 3:2.





Magnesium


The best-absorbed of magnesium’s many forms include magnesium aspartate, ascorbate, amino acid chelate, gluconate, orotate, and carbonate. Toxic effects include blushing of the skin, thirst, low blood pressure, loss of reflexes, and respiratory depression. Toxicity is likely to occur only in people with kidney disease who are taking magnesium supplements. For normal, healthy adults, a daily intake of up to 1,000 mg is considered safe. Magnesium interacts with calcium, so magnesium supplements should be given only to people with adequate calcium intake or supplementing calcium. The ideal ratio of magnesium to calcium is probably 2:3, and in cases of magnesium deficiency 1:1.





Iron


This is one of the most frequently deficient minerals. According to the Health & Nutrition Examination Survey, nine out of ten women were obtaining insufficient iron from their diet. Iron comes in many different forms, the best absorbed of which include ferrous aspartate, amino acid chelate, succinate, lactate, and gluconate (ferric forms are less well absorbed).

Ferrous sulfate is less toxic than ferric forms of iron. Even so, 3 g of ferrous sulfate can cause death in an infant, compared with 12 g for an adult. Supplements containing a significant amount of iron should be kept in a childproof container. Iron is stored in the body and therefore toxicity can result from chronic excessive intake, producing hemosiderosis, a generalized deposition of iron within body tissue, or hemochromatosis, normally a hereditary condition resulting in cirrhosis of the liver, bronze pigmentation of the skin, diabetes, arthritis, and heart abnormalities.

Hemochromatosis is far more common than is realized. One in two hundred people has these genetic mutations that mean they are at risk of suffering from iron overload, the symptoms of which are extreme fatigue and abdominal pain. Provided you don’t have hemochromatosis, 50 mg a day as a supplement is generally considered safe; however, even this is unnecessary to correct acute anemia. A third of pregnant women show some level of iron-deficiency anemia, which is easily corrected by supplementing up to 25 mg a day.

Iron is antagonistic to many other trace minerals including zinc, which is often deficient, especially among pregnant and lactating women. Therefore, extra iron should not be supplemented without ensuring adequate zinc status or supplementing zinc. The normal requirement for zinc and iron is approximately equal.





Zinc


This is one of the most thoroughly researched and commonly deficient minerals. About a thousand papers are published each year indicating its value for a variety of conditions. The best-absorbed forms of zinc include zinc picolinate, amino acid chelate, citrate, and gluconate. Zinc supplementation is relatively nontoxic. When it’s taken in doses of 2,000 mg, symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fever, and severe anemia have been reported. Small amounts of zinc, particularly in the form of zinc sulfate, can act as an irritant in the digestive tract when taken on an empty stomach. There is also some evidence that, at levels of 300 mg per day, zinc may impair rather than improve immune function. It is generally considered safe to supplement up to 50 mg per day.

Zinc is an iron, manganese, and copper antagonist; therefore, an adequate intake of these minerals is advisable if large amounts of zinc are taken over a long period. Manganese is very poorly absorbed, so it is generally advisable to supplement half as much manganese as zinc if more than 20 mg of zinc a day is supplemented. The normal requirement for zinc is about ten times that of copper. Since the average intake of copper for people on a healthy diet is on the order of 2 mg, those supplementing more than 20 mg of zinc may be advised to add 1 mg of copper for each additional 10 mg of zinc. It is also best to ensure that at least 12 mg of iron is supplemented when you are taking more than 20 mg of zinc.





Copper


Deficiency of this mineral is quite rare, probably because we get it from drinking water as well as from unrefined foods. The best-absorbed forms of copper include copper amino acid chelate and gluconate. Requirements are low (2 mg per day), and only 5 mg a day is required to correct deficiency. Toxicity does occur, mainly due to excessive intake from water that flows through copper pipes. Copper is also a strong antagonist of zinc, and for this reason it is advisable not to supplement more than 2 mg or a tenth of one’s intake of zinc. Copper also depletes manganese.





Manganese


No more than 2 to 5 percent of dietary manganese is absorbed, so increasing your intake from food has only a slight effect on overall body levels. The better forms for absorption include amino acid chelates, gluconates, and orotates. There is some evidence that vitamin C may help the absorption of manganese. In animals, it is one of the least toxic of all trace elements. Toxicity has never been reported in humans. A daily intake of up to 50 mg is considered safe. Excessive zinc or copper intake interferes with manganese uptake.





Selenium


This trace element is required in very small amounts of 25 to 200 mcg per day. It comes in two forms: organic, such as selenomethionine or selenocystine, sometimes in the form of selenium yeast; and inorganic, as sodium selenite. The inorganic form is more toxic, with toxicity occurring at levels of 1,000 mcg or more. The organic forms show toxicity above 2,000 mcg. No toxicity has been reported with either form at intakes of 750 mcg. An intake of up to 500 mcg for an adult is generally considered safe. In view of the relatively small difference between beneficial and detrimental intake, selenium should be kept out of reach of children.





Chromium


Of the two forms of chromium found in nature, hexavalent and trivalent, hexavalent is much more toxic. However, it is found neither in food nor in supplements, so contamination can occur only from occupational exposure. The better-absorbed forms of chromium are picolinate, amino acid chelate, and polynicotinate. Trivalent chromium has a very low toxicity, partly because so little is absorbed. An intake of up to 500 mcg is certainly considered safe.

You might have heard a rumor that chromium picolinate could cause DNA damage. This was based on a study in 1995 in which hamsters were given amounts of chromium several thousands of times higher than you would ever take in a supplement.6 A further animal study in 1997 gave amounts five thousand times higher than the 200 mcg I recommend and failed to find any evidence of toxicity.7 Since then a decade of research including more than thirty human trials has also shown no safety concerns. The fact is, there is no evidence that supplementing chromium picolinate, let alone any other form of chromium, has the potential to cause cancer in either animals or humans. In the United States, the National Toxicology Program investigated chromium picolinate and found no evidence of “genotoxicity” or any other ill effects. And now, even the UK’s Food Standards Agency agrees that chromium is nontoxic, even in amounts ten times higher than the average 200 mcg supplement.
