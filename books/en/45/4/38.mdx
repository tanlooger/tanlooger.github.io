title: 38. Mental Health—The Nutrition Connection
---




Life in the twenty-first century is stressful. Some of us are rising to the challenge, but most of us are struggling to keep up and are living with tiredness, anxiety, stress, depression, and sleeping problems as a result. Some people tip over the edge into mental health problems—from attention-deficit disorder to Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. In fact, the world over, there’s been a massive increase in the incidence of mental health problems, especially among young people. The incidences of autism, suicide, violence, and depression are on the increase, according to the World Health Organization. Mental health problems, they say, are fast becoming the number one health issue, with one in ten people suffering at any point in time, and one in four people suffering at some point in their lives.74

If you’ve got a strange set of physical symptoms, your doctor is probably going to run a basic biochemical screening blood test to see if anything abnormal shows up. The same is rarely done for those with mental health problems, as the belief is that biochemical imbalances don’t manifest as psychological symptoms. Of course, the reverse is true. The brain is far more sensitive to biochemical imbalances and nutritional deficiencies than any other organ of the body.

The very fact that most treatment of mental illness involves chemical drugs is an indication of the direct link between a person’s biochemical state and their psychological state. We also know that deficiencies in nutrients, and excesses in “antinutrients” such as lead or chemical additives, can cause mental health symptoms.

There’s more to it than that, however. Having worked with thousands of people with mental health problems, I’m convinced that most have one, or more, of a combination of thirteen common biochemical imbalances that if left untreated can lead to mental illness.

So, if you do have mental health problems, it is well worth checking out these imbalances, each of which has a clear set of symptoms. If you have some or all of the symptoms, then an objective biochemical test can be run to confirm whether or not this imbalance is present. Then, a nutritional strategy can be implemented to help solve the problem.





A new diagnosis of mental health problems


The diagnosis of mental health problems should be based on the observation of symptoms, objectively measured in questionnaire tests, and on physical and biochemical tests that help determine if any of the many kinds of biochemical imbalances are causing, or contributing to, a person’s problems. Here are some of the more common biochemical imbalances that can result in symptoms of mental illness.





1. Blood sugar imbalance


The most common underlying imbalance in many types of mental health problems is fluctuating blood sugar levels, called dysglycemia. If you’ve got this, the chances are you crave sweet foods or stimulants such as tea, coffee, and cigarettes, all of which affect your blood sugar level. Here are the most common symptoms:

Difficulty concentrating

Heart palpitations

Fainting, dizziness, or trembling

Excessive sweating or night sweats

Excessive thirst

Chronic fatigue

Frequent mood swings

Forgetfulness or confusion

Tendency to depression

Anxiety and irritability

Feeling weak

Aggressive outbursts or crying spells

Cravings for sweets or stimulants

Drowsiness after meals



If you’ve got five or more of these symptoms, you are likely to have dysglycemia. The best way to confirm this is by a blood test that measures “glycosylated hemoglobin.” As more and more people are becoming dysglycemic, the incidence of related conditions such as obesity, age-related memory loss, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and diabetes is also on the increase.

Here are a few simple steps you can take to help balance your blood sugar:

Avoid sugar and foods containing sugar.

Break your addiction to caffeine by avoiding coffee, tea, and other caffeinated drinks for a month, while improving your diet. Once you are no longer craving caffeine, the occasional cup of weak tea and very occasional coffee is not a big deal.

Break an addiction to chocolate, if you have one.

Always have something substantial for breakfast, such as an unrefined oat-based cereal; unsweetened live yogurt with banana, ground sesame seeds, and wheat germ; or an egg.

Eat a high-fiber diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruit. Fiber helps keeps your blood sugar level even.

Certain vitamins and minerals can help regulate your blood sugar level and minimize the withdrawal effects of stimulants. These include vitamin C, vitamin B complex, especially vitamin B6, and the minerals magnesium and chromium.





2. Stimulant and drug dependence


Although many people know that drinking and eating stimulants is not good for their health, it is not assumed that it can make them crazy. This is far from the truth. Excessive intake of stimulants (tea, coffee, alcohol, sugar, cola, caffeine pills, cigarettes) can bring on symptoms of mental illness. The symptoms are very similar to those for dysglycemia, coupled with cravings for any of these substances. In addition, you can experience extreme anxiety, paranoia, and depression through the excessive use of some of these substances. Complete the stimulant inventory in chapter 11 and take the necessary steps to reduce your stimulant load.





3. Food and chemical allergies and intolerances


If you suffer from daily mood swings, or are fine at some times and not at others for no apparent reason, one possibility is that you are reacting to something you’re eating. The most common single food that’s been linked to mental health problems is wheat, which is a rich source of gluten. Other foods that can cause allergic reactions include milk products, oranges, eggs, grains other than wheat, foods with yeast, shellfish, nuts, beef, pork, and onions. Food colorings such as tartrazine and other chemical additives can also cause problems. Some people develop intolerances to tea and coffee, while alcohol, which irritates the gut wall and makes it more leaky, often increases allergic sensitivity to anything eaten. Check yourself out on the symptoms below:

Childhood history of colic, eczema, asthma, rashes, or ear infections

Daily mood swings

Deep depressions for no particular reason

Frequent, rapid colds or blocked nose

Difficulty sleeping

Facial puffiness, circles or discoloration around the eyes

Hyperactivity

Dyslexia or learning difficulties

Aggressive outbursts or crying spells



If you score five or more, or know you feel better when you avoid certain foods, then food or chemical allergies/intolerances may be contributing to your problem. The best advice is to see a nutritional therapist, who can show you how to do a two-week avoidance-and-reintroduction test with your suspect foods. Alternatively, have a quantitative IgG ELISA allergy test using a simple home test kit (see Resources). This involves a pinprick of blood from which you can be tested for allergy to over a hundred different foods and chemicals.





4. Underactive or overactive thyroid


If your mind and body feel sluggish most of the time, you may have an underactive thyroid, referred to as hypothyroidism. If your thyroid is clinically underactive, your doctor may prescribe thyroid hormones. However, blood tests are often unable to detect subclinical hypothyroidism, so it may be better to go by the symptoms. You can test your thyroid function yourself with the Broda Barnes temperature test. If your temperature before you rise in the morning is consistently below 97.7°F, this suggests your thyroid may be underactive. Below are the typical symptoms of hypothyroidism:

Physical or mental fatigue or lethargy

Depression or irritability

Dry skin and/or hair

Intolerance to cold or cold hands and feet

Constipation, gas, bloating, or indigestion

Weight gain

Painful periods

Muscle pain

Poor memory

Sore throat or nasal congestion



If you score five or more, an underactive thyroid may be contributing to your problem. Get it tested by your doctor and also see a nutritional therapist, who can show you which foods to eat and which foods to avoid to support your thyroid. Chronic stress can deplete thyroid function, as the stress hormone, Cortisol, inhibits it. Thyroid health is also dependent on specific nutrients in the diet, most importantly iodine—which is abundant in seafood and seaweed—zinc, selenium, and tyrosine, an amino acid found in all protein-rich foods.

Having an overactive thyroid can lead to mania, overactivity, and a fast metabolism, so it is not common for people with this condition to be overweight. If these symptoms are present, ask your doctor to check your thyroid function.





5. Niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6), folic acid, or B12 deficiency


These four B vitamins are your brain’s best friends. They “oil the wheels” of the brain’s neurotransmitters, especially dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and serotonin. These neurotransmitters are the brain’s chemicals of communication, sending messages from one brain cell to another. Without enough of these essential B vitamins, the brain can produce chemicals that make you feel crazy. This is because they help control methylation, a chemical process that goes on throughout the brain and body, helping to turn one neurotransmitter into another. Some people need a lot more B vitamins than others, so it’s best to be guided by symptoms, rather than by blood tests. Here are the more common symptoms of a deficiency in these vitamins:

Feeling “unreal”

Hearing your own thoughts

Anxiety and inner tension

Inability to think straight

Suspicion of people

Good pain tolerance

Seeing or hearing things abnormally

Having delusions or illusions

Loose bowels or skin problems at onset of mental health problems

Difficult sexual orgasm

Tendency to gain weight

Frequent mood swings



If you have five or more of these symptoms, it may be worth your while increasing your intake of these nutrients for two months. As a recommendation try 100 mg of B3, 100 mg of B6, 1,000 mcg of folic acid, and 100 mcg of B12.





6. Essential fatty acids—deficiencies and imbalances


Your brain is 60 percent fat, if you take out all the water. This fatty tissue needs replenishing, but it’s crucial to know which fats will feed your brain the best. Essential fatty acids known as omega-3 and omega-6 are intimately involved in brain function, and deficiencies or imbalances in brain fats are now known to be associated with everything from dyslexia, hyperactivity, and depression, to schizophrenia and manic depression.

Most authorities agree that of our total fat intake, no more than one-third should be saturated (hard) fat, and at least one-third should be polyunsaturated oils providing the two essential fats omega-3 and omega-6. These two essential fats also need to be roughly in balance—in other words 1:1, which is the ratio our pre-industrial revolution ancestors achieved. Nowadays, an average balance is more like 1:20 in favor of omega-6. It may not be just gross deficiency in these fats, but also the gross imbalance between the two types, that is contributing to the mental and other health problems we see today.

Why is the modern diet likely to be more deficient in omega-3 fats than in omega-6? It’s all because the grandmother of the omega-3 family, alpha-linolenic acid, and her metabolically active grandchildren EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docasahexaenoic acid), are more unsaturated and so more prone to damage by cooking, heating, and food processing. In fact, the average person today eats a mere one-sixth of the omega-3 fats found in the diets of people living in 1850. This decline is partly due to food choices, but mainly to food processing.

In short, it is important to assess your need for essential fats if you have a mental health problem. Common symptoms of deficiency or imbalance include:

Excessive thirst

Chronic fatigue

Dry or rough skin

Dry hair, loss of hair, or dandruff

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or breast pain

Eczema, asthma, or joint ache

Dyslexia or learning difficulties

Hyperactivity

Depression or manic depression

Schizophrenia



If you have five or more of these symptoms and you have a mental health problem, it might be a good idea to have a blood test to determine your essential fat status. The best foods for brain fats are:

Omega-3: flaxseeds, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, anchovies, tuna, and eggs.

Omega-6: sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, corn, soybeans, and wheat germ.

As far as supplements are concerned, for omega-3, take fish oils (at least 200 mg of EPA and 200 mg of DHA), or one to two tablespoons of flaxseed oil. For omega-6, take borage oil, 500 to 1,000 mg a day, or evening primrose oil, 1,000 mg a day.





7. Heavy-metal toxicity


Heavy metals are so commonplace in our modern environment that the average person has body levels seven hundred times higher than those of our ancestors. Although high levels of lead are less common since the advent of lead-free gasoline, some people have very high copper levels, mainly from copper plumbing in soft-water areas. Copper, although an essential mineral, can also be a toxic one when levels are elevated. High levels of cadmium are often found in smokers, as tobacco is relatively rich in it. Mercury from dental fillings can result in memory loss, and aluminum from cookware and foil is associated with senility. Check yourself out on the symptoms below:

Anxiety, extreme fears, or paranoia

Phobias

Poor concentration or confusion

Poor memory

Angry or aggressive feelings

Hyperactivity

Emotional instability

Headaches or migraines

Joint pain

Nervousness



If you have five or more of these symptoms, a hair mineral analysis is suggested to test whether you’ve got an excess of toxic minerals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test can also highlight deficiencies in important minerals such as zinc, magnesium, and manganese. A nutritional therapist can arrange this test for you.





8. Pyroluria and porphyria


Some people produce more of the proteinlike chemicals kryptopyrroles and porphyrins than is healthy. An excess is linked to mental illness. The madness of King George III, for example, was almost certainly caused by porphyria. This, and probably pyroluria, is a genetically inherited tendency that increases a person’s need for zinc. Stress also depletes zinc. So, if your mental health problems are strongly stress-related and the symptoms below apply to you, you may be pyroluric, or even porphyric, although the latter is much less common.

Nausea or constipation

White spots on fingernails

Pale skin that burns easily

Frequent colds and infections

Stretch marks

Irregular menstruation

Impotency

Crowded upper front teeth

Poor tolerance of alcohol or drugs

Poor dream recall



If you score five or more you may be pyroluric. You can test this by having a urine test for kryptopyrroles. If your level is high, you need more zinc and vitamin B6. Try 25 mg of zinc and 100 mg of B6 a day.





9. Histamine imbalance


Histamine is an often-overlooked neurotransmitter. Some people are genetically preprogrammed to produce too much histamine, a condition known as histadelia, and this can make a person excessively compulsive and obsessive. High-histamine types have a faster metabolism and therefore use up nutrients at a fast rate. Without good nutrition, they can easily become deficient, which can precipitate patches of deep depression. These are some of the symptoms associated with excess histamine:

Headaches or migraines

Sneezing in sunlight

Crying, salivating, or feeling nauseated easily

Easy sexual orgasm

Abnormal fears, compulsions, rituals

Light sleep

Fast metabolism

Depression or suicidal thoughts

Producing a lot of body heat

Little body hair and lean build

Large ears or long fingers and toes

Good tolerance of alcohol

Inner tension or driven feeling

Shyness or oversensitivity as a child

Seasonal allergies (for example, hay fever)

Obsessive or compulsive tendencies



If you have five or more of these symptoms, you may be a high-histamine type. You can confirm this by having a blood test for histamine. If your blood levels are high, you will benefit from supplementing vitamin C. Since histamine is detoxified by methylation, check your homocysteine level (see chapter 10).

Low levels of histamine are associated with the same kind of symptoms as B3, B12, and folic acid deficiency (see point 5, this page), and respond well to supplementing of these nutrients. Histamine levels can also be determined as part of an overall neurotransmitter screening test.





10. Serotonin imbalance


A deficiency of the neurotransmitter serotonin is one of the most common findings in people with mental health problems. It is associated with sleeping problems, mood disturbance, and aggressive and compulsive behavior. Check yourself out on the symptoms below:

Depression, especially postmenopausal

Anxiety

Aggressive or suicidal thoughts

Violent or impulsive behavior

Mood swings, including PMS

Obsessive or compulsive tendencies

Alcohol or drug abuse

Sensitivity to pain (low pain threshold)

Craving for sweet foods

Sleeping problems



If you have scored five or more you may be low in serotonin. A neurotransmitter screening test can help confirm this.

Antidepressant drugs like Prozac work by stopping the body from breaking down serotonin, thereby keeping more circulating in the brain. The trouble is that these kinds of drugs can induce unpleasant side effects. If you’re low in serotonin, the natural alternative to take is 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). This is a precursor to serotonin and can help restore normal levels.





11. Adrenal imbalance


The adrenal glands and the brain produce three motivating neurotransmitters called dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. The adrenal glands also produce Cortisol. An excess of adrenaline can result in a state of high stress and anxiety, while a deficiency can result in the opposite—low energy, no motivation, and poor concentration. There is evidence that some people may abnormally turn excessive amounts into toxins that induce disperceptions and even hallucinations. Check yourself out on the symptoms below:

Irritability

Nervousness or anxiety

Extreme fears

Raised blood pressure

Rapid or irregular heartbeat

Insomnia

Cold hands and feet

Excessive sweating

Teeth grinding

Headaches or migraines

Muscle tension

Restlessness

Seeing or hearing things



If you can relate to five or more of the symptoms, you may have excessive levels of adrenaline or Cortisol. If, on the other hand, the symptoms below sound like you, you may have adrenal insufficiency:

Depression

Difficulty concentrating

Short attention span

Lack of drive or motivation

Difficulty in initiating or completing tasks

Frequent tiredness

Inability to deal with stress

Social withdrawal



Both excess and deficiency can be tested either with an adrenal stress index, using saliva samples, or as part of a neurotransmitter screening test. For high adrenaline levels, cut back on stimulants and sugar and up your intake of vitamins B and C. If you have low adrenaline levels, you may benefit from supplementing the amino acid tyrosine. “Adaptogenic” herbs such as Asian or Siberian ginseng or rhodiola can also help.





12. Acetylcholine imbalance


Acetylcholine is the brain’s learning neurotransmitter. Low levels are associated with memory loss and even Alzheimer’s disease. Levels tend to decline with age, but they don’t have to if you are optimally nourished. Check yourself out on the symptoms below:

Poor dream recall

Infrequent dreaming

Difficulty visualizing

Dry mouth

Poor memory or forgetfulness

Mental exhaustion

Poor concentration

Difficulty learning new things



If you score five or more on the symptom list, the chances are that you might be low in acetylcholine. A neurotransmitter screening test can help confirm this. Alternatively, you can simply supplement brain-friendly nutrients, such as a combination of phosphatidyl choline, serine, DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol), pyroglutamate, and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5).





13. High homocysteine


A high level of homocysteine is very strongly linked with depression, schizophrenia, memory decline, and Alzheimer’s disease. For example, having a high homocysteine level doubles a person’s risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, while 52 percent of depressed people have high homocysteine. When homocysteine is high, it results in your losing the ability to keep brain chemicals in balance. You consequently start feeling disconnected. This can result in depression and confusion. Check yourself out on the indicators below:

Depression

Poor concentration and memory

Chronic tiredness

Headaches or migraines

Sleeping problems

Joint or muscle aches or arthritis

Deteriorating eyesight

Family history of heart disease

Family history of schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s disease

Frequent alcohol, coffee, or cigarettes



If you score five or more, you may have a high homocysteine level. You can test your homocysteine level using a simple home test kit (see Resources). The solution is to up your intake of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid, plus omega-3 fats.





In summary


The easiest way to find out if there’s a possibility that one or more of these imbalances is contributing to your problems is by completing the mental health questionnaire on the website www.mentalhealthproject.com. It gives you a printout, which you can copy and give to your doctor, and advises you on what to do to eliminate these common causes of mental health problems using the principles of optimum nutrition.
