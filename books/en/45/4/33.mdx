title: 33. Fighting Infections Naturally
---




Prevention is better than cure and, as Louis Pasteur said on his deathbed, the host is more important than the invader. Medical scientists are increasingly finding that we succumb to bugs only when we are run-down, so your best line of defense is to keep your immune system strong so that it is ready to attack when an invader comes along (read chapter 24 on boosting the immune system). Invaders come in many shapes and sizes: there are bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as parasites. It is important to know which you are dealing with, as each requires slightly different treatment. A cold, flu, herpes, and measles are all viruses. Most ear infections, stomachaches, and chest and sinus infections (usually following a cold) are bacterial. Thrush and athlete’s foot are fungal infections.

Immune-boosting nutrients are good year-round, especially if you are rundown or exposed to people with infections. During an infection, both the invader and our own immune army produce free radicals to destroy each other. We can minesweep these dangerous chemicals with antioxidant nutrients, which are good for everybody at any time. Antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents are best increased when dealing with a specific invader. Judging by the results of research on vitamin C, it would be wrong to believe that immune-healthy people get no infections. They just have “precolds” that are all over in twenty-four hours, where less healthy people end up horizontal for a week. So the aim is to boost your immune system by giving it the right food and the right environment, so it can adapt quickly to attempted invasions.

While vitamin C’s main strength is against viruses, grapefruit seed extract, for example, is antibacterial or “antibiotic.” The table below shows which natural remedies work best against different kinds of invaders (see also the A to Z of natural infection-fighters on this page).

WHICH INVADERS, WHICH NATURAL REMEDY?





Get in fast


The best form of defense is attack, and the quicker you get in there the more chance you have of restoring your health before an infection sets in. All invaders produce toxins as part of their weapons of war. If you wake up feeling more tired than usual, perhaps with bloodshot eyes, a slight headache, itchy throat, slightly blocked nose, or foggy brain—and you haven’t been drinking the night before—you are probably under attack! Just as when you have consumed alcohol, these are signs that your body is trying to eliminate an undesirable agent. If the war is raging, turn up the heat.

The immune system works best in a warm environment, which is why the body creates a fever to turn up the temperature. So keep yourself warm and get plenty of rest. One day taking it easy can make all the difference, especially if you boost your immune army with natural remedies. Lack of sleep depletes your energy reserves. Also avoid all the other ways in which we habitually dissipate energy: alcohol consumption, exposure to smoky atmospheres, strong sunlight and stress, overeating, engaging in arguments, overexertion, having sex, and taking antibiotics. You can tilt the balance in your favor by reducing these energy robbers.

There is some truth in the old saying “Starve a fever, feed a cold.” During an infection, listen to your body. It is fine not to eat for a day, but if an infection goes on for a long time, your immune system does need a number of nutrients, plus protein, to replenish the troops. It is best to eat lightly—small meals made from high-energy natural foods, raw or lightly cooked. During an infection, the body fights hard to eliminate the waste products of war, so drink plenty of water or herb tea to help your body detoxify and reduce mucus. Avoid salt and mucus-forming and fatty foods, such as meat, eggs, and dairy products.





How to kill a cold


There is some dispute among nutritionists about the effect of vitamin C on the common cold. At an amount below 1 gram of vitamin C a day, there is little evidence of substantial reduction in colds. At 1 gram a day, some studies show fewer colds, and most studies show shorter or less severe colds.51 I estimate that the optimal daily intake of vitamin C for cold prevention, especially if you are over forty, have a stressful lifestyle, live in a city, and meet lots of people, is 2 grams a day.

While 1 or 2 grams of vitamin C a day helps to reduce the severity and incidence of colds, achieving “tissue saturation” during a cold has even greater results. In order to take hold, a cold virus must get inside cells and reprogram them to make more cold viruses, which then infect other cells. However, if the body’s tissues are high in vitamin C, the virus cannot survive. Tissue saturation is more likely to be achieved by taking in around 10 to 15 grams a day, or 2 grams every four hours, which is 250 times the recommended daily allowance (RDA)! Fortunately vitamin C is one of the least toxic substances known. A daily intake of 2 to 3 grams, spread out through the day, may be sufficient to maintain a high level of immune protection.

Viruses get into body cells by puncturing their walls with tiny spikes made of a substance called hemagglutinin. According to research by virologist Madeleine Mumcuoglu, working with Dr. Jean Linderman, who discovered interferon, an extract of elderberry disarms these spikes by binding to them and preventing them from penetrating the cell membrane. “This was the first discovery,” says Mumcuoglu. “Later I found evidence that elderberry also fights flu virus in other ways. Viral spikes are covered with an enzyme called neuraminidase, which helps break down the cell wall. The elderberry inhibits the action of that enzyme. My guess is that we’ll find elderberry acts against viruses in other ways as well.”52

In a double-blind controlled trial she tested the effects of the elderberry extract on people diagnosed with any one of a number of strains of flu virus. The results, published in 1995, showed a significant improvement in symptoms—fever, cough, muscle pain—in 20 percent of patients within twenty-four hours, and in a further 73 percent of patients within forty-eight hours. After three days, 90 percent had complete relief from their symptoms compared with another group on a placebo, who look at least six days to recover. While this is the first published trial of elderberry extract, I have heard many success stories from my clients who have successfully speeded up recovery from colds and flu by taking elderberry extract.





Immune-boosting herbs


More and more immune-boosting herbs are being discovered to help fight infections. Four excellent ones, covered in greater detail in the list below, are cat’s claw, echinacea, garlic, and grapefruit seed extract. Cat’s claw tea tastes good with added black currant and apple concentrate, and one cup a day helps maintain immune power. If you have a sore throat or stomach upset, add four slices of root ginger. Echinacea is the original Native American “snakeroot”, which later became known as snake oil. The great advantage of grapefruit seed extract is that it has a similar effect to antibiotics but without damaging beneficial gut bacteria as conventional antibiotics do. Even if you are taking probiotics like acidophilus, it is best to take them separately from grapefruit seed extract.

Steps to help you fight an infection (for more specific information on dosages see the list further below)

Eat lightly, making sure you get enough protein, which is needed to build immune cells, and keep warm. If you have a mucus-related infection, avoid dairy products.

Increase your intake of vitamin C to 3 grams every four hours.

Drink cat’s claw tea and consider adding ginger and echinacea drops and taking garlic capsules or cloves.

If you have a cold, take one tablespoon of Sambucol four times a day.

If you have a bacterial, fungal, or parasitical infection, take ten drops of grapefruit seed extract two or three times a day.

Find out what your infection is and, if necessary see your doctor, especially if you are not better within five days.

Consider other remedies in the A to Z of natural infection fighters below.





A to Z of natural infection fighters


Two doses are given below: the first for pulling out the plug when under attack, the second for general maintenance. Once an invasion is over, wait forty-eight hours before going on to the maintenance dose. Some natural remedies have no maintenance dose and are recommended only to fight an infection.





Vitamin A


Vitamin A is one of the key immune-boosting nutrients. It helps strengthen the skin, inside and out, and therefore acts as a first line of defense, keeping the lungs, digestive tract, and skin intact. By strengthening cell walls, it keeps viruses out. Vitamin A can be toxic in large doses, so levels above 10,000 IU are recommended only on a short-term basis.

Fighting infections 10,000 to 25,000 IU (one week only) a day.



Maintenance 7,500 IU a day.





Aloe vera


Has immune-boosting, antiviral, and antiseptic properties. It is a good all-round tonic, as well as a booster during any infection. Daily dose as instructed on the bottle.





Antioxidants


Substances that detoxify free radicals. These include vitamins A, C, E, and beta-carotene and zinc, selenium, and many other nonessential substances, including silymarin (milk thistle), pycnogenol, lipoic acid, bioflavonoids, and bilberry extract. It is best to take an all-round antioxidant supplement during any infection.





Artemisia


A natural antifungal, antiparasitical, and antibacterial agent, often used alongside caprylic acid for the treatment of candidiasis or thrush.

Fighting infections 100 to 1,000 mg a day.





Astragalus


A Chinese herb renowned for all-round immunity boosting. It is high in beneficial mucopolysaccharides.

Fighting infections 1 to 3 grams a day.



Maintenance 200 mg a day.





Beta-carotene


The vegetable source of vitamin A and an antioxidant in its own right. Red, orange, and yellow foods and fresh vegetables are the best sources. Drinking carrot or watermelon juice is a great way to boost your levels of this all-round infection fighter.

Fighting infections 10,000 to 25,000 IU a day.



Maintenance 7,500 IU a day.





Vitamin C


Vitamin C is an incredible antiviral agent. Viruses cannot survive in a vitamin C-rich environment. To achieve this, you need to take 3 grams of vitamin C immediately and then 2 grams every four hours. Alternatively, mix 6 to 10 grams of vitamin C powder in fruit juice diluted with water and drink throughout the day. Vitamin C is nontoxic, but too much can cause loose bowels. Decrease the dose if this becomes unacceptable.

Fighting infections 6 to 10 grams a day.



Maintenance 1 to 3 grams a day.





Bee pollen


A natural antibiotic. It is probably better as a general tonic than as a specific treatment. Be careful if you are pollen-sensitive.

Fighting infections 1 to 2 tablespoons a day.



Maintenance 1 teaspoon a day.





Caprylic acid


An antifungal agent derived from coconuts, primarily used for eliminating the Candida albicans organism responsible for thrush. Anticandida programs are best carried out under the supervision of a qualified nutrition consultant.

Fighting infections 1 to 3 grams a day.





Cat’s claw


A powerful antiviral, antioxidant, and immune-boosting agent from the Peruvian rainforest plant Uncaria tomentosa. It contains chemicals called alkaloids, one of which is isopteridin, which has been proved to boost immune function. It is available as a tea or in supplements.

Fighting infections 2 to 6 grams a day.



Maintenance 2 grams a day.





Cysteine


See Glutathione and cysteine.





Vitamin E


Vitamin E is the most important fat-soluble antioxidant. You will find it in nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and their cold-pressed oils, but make sure they are fresh. Vitamin E is best supplemented every day during an infection.

Fighting infections 450 to 900 IU a day.





Echinacea


A great multitasker with antiviral and antibacterial properties. The active ingredients are thought to be specific mucopolysaccharides. It comes in capsules and in extracts, taken as drops.

Fighting infections 2 to 3 grams a day (or 15 drops of concentrated extract three times a day).



Maintenance 1 gram a day.





Elderberry extract (also called Sambucol)


Reduces the duration of colds and flu by preventing the virus from taking hold.

Fighting infections 1 tablespoon three times a day.





Garlic


Contains allicin, a substance that is antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial. It also acts as an antioxidant, being rich in sulfur-containing amino acids. There is no doubt that it is an important ally in fighting infections, and a wise inclusion in your diet as garlic eaters have the lowest incidence of cancer. Consider a clove or capsule equivalent for an easy guide to your daily dose.

Fighting infections 2 to 6 cloves a day.



Maintenance 1 clove a day.





Ginger


Particularly good for sore throats and stomach upsets. Put six slices of fresh root ginger in a thermos with a stick of cinnamon and fill up with boiling water. Five minutes later you have a delicious, throat-soothing ginger and cinnamon tea. You can add a little lemon and honey for taste.





Glutathione and cysteine


These are both powerful antioxidant amino acids. You will find them in many all-round antioxidant supplements. During a prolonged viral infection, they get depleted and it may be worth taking a supplement. The most usable forms are reduced glutathione or N-acetyl-cysteine.

Fighting infections 2 to 3 grams a day.



Maintenance 1 gram a day.





Goldenseal


A natural antibacterial agent containing specific alkaloids that are particularly helpful for mucous membrane problems. Can be used in douches or in gargles as an antiseptic and be taken internally for a healthy digestive system.

Fighting infections 200 to 500 mg a day.





Grapefruit seed extract (also called Citricidal)


A powerful natural antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agent. It comes in drops and can be swallowed, gargled with, or used as nose drops or eardrops, depending on the site of infection.

Fighting infections 20 to 30 drops a day.



Maintenance 5 drops a day.





Lysine


An amino acid that helps get rid of the herpes virus. (During an infection, it is best to limit arginine-rich foods such as beans, lentils, nuts, and chocolate.)

Fighting infections 1 to 3 grams a day.



Maintenance 1 gram a day.





Mushrooms


Shiitake, maitake, reishi, ganoderma, and other mushrooms were traditionally believed by Chinese Taoists to confer immortality. All have been shown to contain immune-boosting polysaccharides. You will find them added to some immune-boosting supplements and tonics, or you can buy shiitake fresh in the supermarket or dried in health food stores.





Probiotics


Unlike antibiotics, these are beneficial bacteria that promote health. It is best to supplement them during a bacterial infection and after a course of antibiotics. The two most important types are Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria. These have been shown to halve the recovery time from a bout of diarrhea.

Dosage Follow instructions on the supplement you choose.





Selenium


An immune-enhancing mineral that also acts as an antioxidant. It is abundant in seafood and seeds, especially sesame, and is included in most antioxidant supplements.

Fighting infections 200 to 300 mcg a day.



Maintenance 100 mcg a day.





St John’s wort (hypericum)


Particularly good for anything that penetrates the skin, such as a wound or skin infection. It is a good general tonic for the immune system.

Fighting infections 50 to 500 mg a day.





Tea tree oil


An Australian remedy with antiseptic properties. Great for rubbing on the chest or using in the bath, steam inhaling, or to help keep mosquitoes away. Take as instructed on the bottle. Lozenges are also available.





Zinc


The most important immune-boosting mineral. There is no doubt that it helps fight infections. Zinc lozenges are available for sore throats. You will also find it included in most antioxidant supplements.

Fighting infections 25 to 50 mg a day.



Maintenance 15 mg a day.
