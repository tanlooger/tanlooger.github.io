title: 37. Solving the Riddle of Eating Disorders
---




Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions characterized by a “definite disturbance of eating habits or weight-control behavior.”65 Figures from the Eating Disorders Association estimate that eating disorders may affect as many as 1.5 million people in the U.S. Eating disorders rank fifteenth among the top twenty causes of disability in women.66 The average length of time for recovery is five to six years.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are probably the best known of the conditions. While both involve restricted food intake, anorexia is characterized by extreme weight loss, while bulimia is characterized by episodes of binge eating and purging to control weight. There is also a further category, “eating disorder not otherwise specified” (EDNOS). This is something of a catchall term for situations where someone has many of the features of an eating disorder, but either not severely enough, or not for long enough, to justify a diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia. Many people with eating problems probably fall into this category

Eating disorders often feature prominently in the media and are surrounded by many myths, having been described as dieting diseases, developmental teenage fads, attempts to avoid growing up, obsessions with food and weight, and so on. Anorexia nervosa was first described as a separate disorder by Dr. William Gull in 1874. It has the highest mortality rate for any psychiatric condition, from the effects of starvation or from suicide. Bulimia nervosa was first categorized as a distinct condition by Dr. Gerald Russell in 1979. It is perhaps the most common of the disorders, although it is also the easiest to hide.





Isn’t anorexia just about zinc deficiency?


In the 1970s, a number of researchers noticed that the symptoms of anorexia were similar in some respects to those of zinc deficiency, giving rise to a hypothesis that zinc supplementation might be useful for treating anorexia and possibly also bulimia. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of small trials were carried out to supplement zinc for patients with anorexia as they started to eat and gain weight. There were some positive results, with improvements in weight gain, mood, emotional state, and menstrual function. The researchers concluded that individuals with anorexia and bulimia may have zinc deficiency. However, the complexity of treating eating disorders clearly indicates that while zinc deficiency may be a contributing factor in the conditions, it is neither the whole story nor the root cause.67





Biochemical and physiological imbalances


People with eating disorders often eat nutrient-poor food, skip meals, or eat very erratically. This may result in a number of underlying biochemical and physiological imbalances that can contribute to many of the associated symptoms. The following are important areas to consider:

Blood sugar imbalance and insulin resistance: Dieting, skipping meals, and bingeing on foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates disrupt blood sugar leading to low blood sugar levels, cravings, and desensitization of cells to insulin.68 Chromium, an important mineral for blood sugar control, is also excreted when the diet is high in sugars. Reliance on caffeine to boost energy blocks the production of both serotonin and melatonin and can result in tiredness, irritability, and feelings of anxiety and depression. The solution is to follow the kind of diet recommended in this book.

Neurotransmitter imbalance: When neurotransmitters are present in sufficient amounts, mood and emotions are stable. When they are depleted, or out of balance, individuals may overeat (particularly sweet and starchy foods) or starve simply to try to manage mood.69

In eating disorders, there may be a particular link to disturbed serotonin metabolism. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in controlling carbohydrate intake, promoting sleep, and managing impulsive and obsessional behaviors. Serotonin is made from tryptophan, an amino acid found in foods such as milk, cottage cheese, poultry, turkey and chicken, eggs, red meat, soybeans, tofu, and almonds. vitamin B6, zinc, and insulin are also needed for serotonin production. Chapter 28 explains how to promote serotonin through nutrition and lifestyle changes.

Dieting has been shown to deplete levels of tryptophan very quickly, particularly in women.70 In one study, when bulimics were deprived of tryptophan, their serotonin levels dropped and they binged on an average of nine hundred additional calories each day.71 This led to a large increase in serotonin production and release within the brain, temporarily reducing stress and depression. However, the serotonin “fix” was followed by overwhelming feelings of guilt and low self-esteem, triggering the powerful need to purge. Vomiting also depresses serotonin levels as the body loses the essential nutrients needed to make serotonin.

Low serotonin may also give rise to some of the personality traits commonly seen with bulimia—depression, impulsiveness, irritability, and mood swings. One further study showed that even years into recovery, bulimics can have a return of their cravings and mood problems after only a few hours of tryptophan depletion.72

Hormone imbalances: The sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone interact with neurotransmitters to stimulate many of the brain’s mood sites. Low estrogen has been linked to low serotonin and an increase in cravings. Low progesterone can lead to infertility, anxiety, and PMS, while too much can lead to lethargy, increased appetite, weight gain, and depression—common symptoms in people with eating problems.

An eating disorder places considerable stress on the body and on the adrenal glands, which are responsible for producing most of the stress hormones. Adrenal stress can easily disrupt other hormones, particularly in the thyroid and the ovaries. Where the diet is low in good-quality protein (for instance, in some vegetarian and vegan diets), the risk of adrenal exhaustion may be even greater owing to a lack of amino acids for hormone production. Vegetarianism is much more common in those with eating disorders (particularly anorexia nervosa) than in the general population.

Food allergies and intolerances: Certain foods may have a mood-altering effect in some people; for instance, refined carbohydrates and sugar impact serotonin and endorphin production, increase blood sugar, and stress the adrenal glands. Wheat (plus rye, oats, and barley) contains gluten, which can interfere with the absorption of nutrients and affect neurotransmitter production and thyroid function. People with gluten intolerance may also be low in serotonin and this may give rise to depression. Casein, a milk protein found in dairy products, and lactose, a milk sugar, may also result in similar problems. Soy can depress thyroid function because its phytate content blocks the uptake of iodine and the absorption of thyroid hormones. Low thyroid function in people who binge eat may contribute to weight gain or obesity.

Deficiency of essential fatty acids: People with eating disorders are often “fat phobic.” Low-fat diets have been associated with depression and irritability partly because essential fats are crucial for brain function and for the production of sex and stress hormones. Blood sugar levels can also drop very rapidly in the absence of fat.

Gastrointestinal disturbance: A diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates may result in yeast overgrowth in the gut. This can contribute to constipation, bloating, slow gastric emptying, and malabsorption, as well as to mental and emotional symptoms. The mechanisms and hormones that control hunger and fullness can also be disrupted.





Optimum nutrition for eating disorders


There have always been differing views as to whether nutritional approaches or psychological treatments hold the key to successful recovery from an eating disorder. Although more research is needed into the efficacy of nutritional approaches, there appears to be growing recognition that the disorders do have nutrition-related aspects and that approaches combining both nutritional and psychological treatment may offer the best possibility for recovery.73

It must, however, be remembered that eating disorders are complex mental health conditions with potentially serious consequences. Care must include psychological treatments, regular medical monitoring, and possibly medication. Nutritional counseling should not be offered as a sole treatment, but it may form part of a multidisciplinary approach. Hospitalization should be considered where people do not respond to outpatient treatment, if weight is very unstable or extremely low, if there are serious physical complications, or if there is risk of suicide.
