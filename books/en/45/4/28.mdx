title: 28. Improving Intelligence, Memory, and Mood
---




Most people believe that intelligence is something you are born with and there is nothing you can do to change it. While there is clearly an inherent component to intelligence, psychologists tell us that we use less than 1 percent of our intellectual capacity and that every day we think thousands of thoughts, the vast majority of which are repeats! Imagine what would happen if we could focus all our mental energy on the task at hand and tap into our full potential.

The brain and nervous system, our mental “hardware,” consist of a network of neurons, special cells that are each capable of forming tens of thousands of connections with others. Thinking and feeling represent a pattern of activity across this network. The activity, or signals, involve neurotransmitters, chemical messengers in the brain. When we learn, we actually change the wiring of the brain. When we think or experience emotions, we change the activity of neurotransmitters. Both brain and neurotransmitters are derived from nutrients and are therefore affected by what you eat and drink.

Neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which is involved in mood, or adrenaline, which gives you motivation, or acetylcholine, which is vital for good memory, are made from the amino acids in the protein you eat. However, their production in the brain depends on vitamins and minerals. These micronutrients help turn glucose into energy, amino acids into neurotransmitters, simple essential fats into more complex fats like GLA or DHA and prostaglandins, and choline and serine into phospholipids. They help build and rebuild the brain and nervous system and keep everything running smoothly. They are your brain’s best friends.

Knowing this, we decided to test what would happen to the intelligence of schoolchildren if given an optimal intake of vitamins and minerals. Gwillym Roberts, a schoolteacher and nutritionist from the Institute for Optimum Nutrition, and Professor David Benton, a psychologist from Swansea University (England), put thirty schoolchildren on a special multivitamin and mineral supplement designed to ensure an optimal intake of key nutrients.1 Another thirty were placed on a placebo.

After eight months on the supplements, the nonverbal IQs in those taking the supplements had risen by over 10 points! No changes were seen in those on the placebos. This study, published in The Lancet in 1988, has since been proven many times in other studies. Most have used recommended daily allowance (RDA) levels of nutrients, much lower than those in our original study, but they still show increases in IQ averaging 4.5 points. In other words, optimum nutrition levels of vitamins and minerals work twice as well as RDA levels. Don’t think it’s just kids who get smarter with optimum nutrition. It works for adults and old people too.

Dr. Chandra from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada decided to test whether supplementation with vitamins and trace elements in modest amounts could improve memory and mental performance in healthy, elderly subjects. He gave ninety-six such men and women, all over the age of sixty-five, either a daily supplement of trace elements and vitamins or a placebo for twelve months. The participants’ blood nutrient levels were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study, as was their immediate and long-term memory, abstract thinking, problem-solving ability, and attention. Of the eighty-six people who completed the year, those taking supplements showed a highly significant improvement in all cognitive tests except long-term memory recall. He also found that the lower the blood nutrient levels, the worse the mental performance.2

But why do vitamins and minerals raise IQ? The answer is that you can think faster and can concentrate for longer with an optimal intake of vitamins and minerals.





The ultimate head start


The sooner you start optimally nourishing your brain, the better. Of course, that puts the responsibility on mothers while pregnant and breast-feeding. A sixteen-year study by the Medical Research Council shows just how critical optimum nutrition is in the early years. They fed 424 premature babies either a standard milk formula or an enriched formula containing extra protein, vitamins, and minerals. At eighteen months, those fed standard milk “were doing significantly less well” than the others, and at eight years they had IQs up to 14 points lower.3





Improving learning difficulties


Even more convincing are the results of optimum nutrition strategies on children with learning difficulties (currently about one in every ten children), including children with Down syndrome, the result of a genetic defect. When researcher Dr. Ruth Harrell heard of a case in which the IQ of a Down syndrome child rose from 20 to 90 points after nutritional intervention, she decided to explore the idea that many mentally retarded children might have been born with increased needs for certain vitamins and minerals.4

In her first study, Dr. Harrell took twenty-two mentally retarded children and divided them into two groups. One group received vitamin and mineral supplements, the other placebos. After four months, the IQ in the group taking the supplements had increased by between 5 and 9.6 points; those on placebos showed no change. For the next four months, both groups of children were given the supplements and the average improvement rose to 10.2 points. Six of the children showed improvements of between 10 and 25 IQ points. While not all researchers have been able to replicate these results, there have now been a substantial number of well-documented cases of Down syndrome children having IQ shifts of 10 to 40 points.

Autistic children and those with learning difficulties have also shown great improvements in intelligence. In a study by Dr. Colgan on sixteen children with learning and behavioral difficulties, the individual nutrient needs of each child were determined. Half the children were then given supplements. Each child attended a remedial reading course designed to improve reading age by one year. Over the next twenty-two weeks, teachers carefully monitored the reading age, IQ, and behavior of the children. Those not taking supplements showed an average increase in IQ of 8.4 points and in reading age of 1.1 years. However, the group on supplements had an improvement in IQ of 17.9 points and their reading age went up by 1.8 years.

A 5 percent shift in IQ score would get a substantial number of children currently classified as educationally subnormal back into regular school, saving millions of dollars spent on special education. Isn’t it time schoolchildren were given free vitamins at a fraction of this cost? This might also reduce aggressive behavior and crime.





Curbing aggressive tendencies


Bernard Gesch, a social worker who became convinced of the link between diet, crime, and delinquency, ran a double-blind trial on young offenders in a maximum-security prison in Aylesbury (UK), giving them either a multinutrient containing vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids, or a placebo. The results, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, showed a staggering 35 percent decrease in acts of aggression after only two weeks.5 Since prison diets are, if anything, better than those most young offenders eat, this shows just how important optimum nutrition is for reducing violent and deviant behavior. When the trial was over and the supplements were stopped, there was a 40 percent increase in offences in the prison.



Effects of optimum nutrition on intelligence.





Brain fats


Particularly important for brain development are the essential fatty acids and phospholipids that form part of the structure of brain cell membranes. Low levels of essential fatty acids are also associated with lower levels of intelligence. This is thought to be the reason why, by the age of seven, children who were breast-fed as babies have been shown to have higher IQs. Breast milk contains DHA, an essential omega-3 fatty acid crucial for brain development. EPA, the other important omega-3 fatty acid, has also been shown to be highly effective in children with dyslexia.

Many studies have shown that an optimal intake of essential fats, especially omega-3 fats, improves intelligence, reduces aggression, and enhances mood. One study in America gave severely depressed patients, who were already on antidepressants, a concentrated supplement of EPA. By the third week, the depressed patients were showing major improvement in their mood, while those on placebo were not.6 Similar results are now being reported in Britain. Dr. Basant Puri from London’s Hammersmith Hospital decided to try EPA on one of his patients, a twenty-one-year-old student who had been on a variety of antidepressants to no avail. He had a very low sense of self-esteem, sleeping problems, and little appetite; found it hard to socialize; and often thought of killing himself. After one month of supplementing the omega-3 fats, he was no longer having suicidal thoughts and after nine months he no longer had any depression.7





Mommy, I shrank your brain


The richest dietary source of EPA and DHA is fish, which is also full of another important family of brain nutrients—phospholipids. The brain and nervous system of a fetus use up more than half the available nutrients supplied during development in the womb and only about one-fourth that amount during adult life. The brain is very dependent on glucose, with almost half of all the available glucose powering it, and on essential fats and phospholipids. Research at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London shows that women’s brains shrink during pregnancy. It seems to be the size of the cells, not the number, that changes, and one possible explanation is that the fetus takes supplies of essential fats and phospholipids from the mother if there are not enough to go around. If this proves to be so, it highlights the importance of getting a sufficient quantity of these essential brain nutrients.





Acetylcholine—the memory molecule


Probably the most important phospholipid is phosphatidyl choline, which also supplies the brain nutrient choline; the latter is needed to make acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter for memory, control of sensory input signals, and muscular control. Acetylcholine deficiency results in poor memory, lethargy, decreased dreaming, and a dry mouth. This is thought to be one of the major causes of senile dementia, which affects one in every seven people over the age of seventy-five. Research on rats at Duke University Medical Center in the United States demonstrated that giving choline during pregnancy creates the equivalent of superbrains in the offspring.

The researchers fed pregnant rats choline halfway through their pregnancy. The infant rats whose mothers were given choline had vastly superior brains with more neuronal connections and, consequently, improved learning ability and better memory recall, all of which persisted into old age. This research showed that giving choline helps restructure the brain for improved performance.8

Acetylcholine is made by the action of choline, an enzyme dependent on vitamin B5. The combination of B5 and choline has proved effective in enhancing memory and mental performance. The best supplemental source of choline is lecithin, which also supplies phospholipids. Lecithin is an emulsifier that is also used in some foods. All health food stores stock it, either as capsules or as granules that can easily be sprinkled on food. However, not all lecithin is the same. Look at the label before you buy, and make sure the product contains more than 30 percent phosphatidyl choline.

One problem with supplementing any form of choline is that it does not readily enter brain cells. This is why large quantities—around a tablespoon of lecithin granules a day—are needed to have an effect.

Another nutrient found in fish, particularly in anchovies and sardines, is DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol), which does pass easily into the brain and can be converted into choline to make acetylcholine. DMAE has been shown to elevate mood, improve memory, increase intelligence and physical energy, and extend the life of laboratory animals. One of the pioneers of DMAE therapy, Dr. Carl Pfeiffer, found it to be an excellent slow-acting stimulant and an alternative to antidepressants. It is currently being researched for its effects on extending lifespan. As one person on DMAE said, “I am more awake when I’m awake, and more sound asleep when I’m asleep. Not only does my memory improve, but I have an easier time daydreaming when I want to, and concentrating on real-world tasks when I want to.”

The positive effects of supplementing another important phospholipid, phosphatidyl serine (PS), are equally amazing. In one study, supplementing PS improved the subjects’ memories to the level of people twelve years younger. Dr. Thomas Crook from the Memory Assessment Clinic in Bethesda, Maryland, gave 149 people with age-associated memory impairment a daily dose of 300 mg of PS or a placebo. When tested after twelve weeks, the ability of those taking PS to match names to faces (a recognized measure of memory and mental function) had vastly improved.9





Smart nutrients


The buzzword in brain enhancement is “nootropics”—substances derived from an amino acid called pyroglutamate that is found in fruit and vegetables. The discovery that the brain and cerebrospinal fluid contain large amounts of pyroglutamate led to its investigation as an essential brain nutrient. Doctors prescribe nootropic drugs, which are chemical variations of pyroglutamate, to millions of people every year for memory-deficit problems. Their basic effect is to improve learning, memory consolidation, and memory retrieval, all without toxicity or side effects.

One extraordinary finding was that nootropics promote the flow of information between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. The left brain is associated with analytical, logical thinking and the right brain with creative, relational thinking. This is thought to be a possible reason why nootropics have proved helpful in the treatment of dyslexia. A study published in 1988 by Dr. Pilch and colleagues suggests that nootropics may increase the number of acetylcholine receptors in the brain, thereby improving the brain’s efficiency.10 Older mice were given piracetam, a pyroglutamate derivative, for two weeks. The researchers found that these mice subsequently had a 30 to 40 percent higher density of receptors. This suggests that pyroglutamate-like molecules not only maximize mental performance but also may have a regenerative effect on the nervous system.





The synergy factor


The effects of enhancing mental performance through supplementation of “smart nutrients” such as omega-3 fats, phosphatidyl choline, PS, pantothenic acid, DMAE, and pyroglutamate are likely to be far greater when these substances are taken in combination than when they are taken individually. In one study in 1981, a team of researchers led by Raymond Barrus gave choline and piracetam to elderly laboratory rats, which are noted for age-related memory decline.11 They found that “rats given the piracetam/choline combination exhibited [memory] retention scores several times better than those with piracetam alone.”11 Only half the dose was needed when piracetam and choline were combined.

I supplement a brain-food formula every day that gives me all of these—phosphatidyl choline, PS, DMAE, pyroglutamate, and pantohenic acid, as well as omega-3 fats. I also eat fish and organic or free-range eggs from chickens fed omega-3-rich feed. You can find these omega-3-rich eggs in most supermarkets.





The brain drain


While “good” chemicals and nutrients can improve mental function, “bad” chemicals can and do reduce your intelligence. Alcohol is a prime example. Coffee, while commonly thought to improve concentration, actually diminishes it. A number of studies have shown that the ability to remember lists of words is made worse by caffeine. According to one researcher, Dr. Erikson, “Caffeine may have a deleterious effect on the rapid processing of ambiguous or confusing stimuli,” which sounds like a description of modern living! The combination of caffeine and alcohol slows reaction time and, in one study, made subjects more drunk than alcohol alone. Caffeine is present in coffee, tea, chocolate, Red Bull, cola drinks, and the herb guarana.

A diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, as discussed earlier, is another factor that reduces intelligence. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the higher the intake of refined carbohydrates, the lower the IQ. In fact, the difference between the high-sugar consumers and the low-sugar consumers was a staggering 25 points!12 Sugar has been implicated in aggressive behavior,13 anxiety,14 hyperactivity and attention-deficit disorder,15 depression,16 eating disorders,17 fatigue,18 learning difficulties,19 and PMS ratings.

Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and aluminum accumulate in the brain and have been clearly demonstrated to reduce intelligence, concentration, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, keeping pollution to a minimum, which includes not smoking, is another prerequisite to boosting your brainpower.

Guidelines for improving your memory and mental performance

Reduce your intake of stimulants such as coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola and of sugar and refined foods.

Minimize your exposure to pollution and cigarettes.

Make sure you are “well oiled” with regular fish, seeds, their oils, or essential fat supplements.

Eat omega-3-rich eggs—at least four a week.

Ensure that you achieve optimum nutrition through your diet and by taking a high-dose multivitamin and mineral supplement.

Take daily supplements of smart nutrients: pantothenic acid 100 to 500 mg; choline 500 to 1,000 mg (or as one heaping teaspoon of high-phosphatidyl-choline lecithin granules); phosphatidyl serine (PS) 30 to 100 mg; DMAE 100 to 500 mg; pyroglutamate 250 to 750 mg.
