title: 30. Achieving Peak Physical Performance

No first-class athlete can afford to ignore optimum nutrition. Capable of increasing speed, endurance, and strength, the right diet and supplements can mean the difference between winning and losing.

My first experience of the power of optimum nutrition in the context of sport was with Mick Ballard, a veteran cyclist who, after changing his diet and starting to take supplements, broke the record for the ten-mile time trial by an astonishing thirty-seven seconds. “I’m convinced that my tremendous improvement in times and recovery is due to my special vitamin program,” said Ballard. Then, at the insistence of her coach, I advised Susan Devoy, rated among the top ten women squash players of her day. She did not think it would make any difference. It did. She became the UK and world number one for much of the next ten years. Athletes on optimum nutrition programs consistently report increased endurance and more rapid recovery.

These findings confirm those of Dr. Michael Colgan, who advises many American Olympic athletes including U.S. mile record-holder Steve Scott, two-time world triathlon champion Julie Moss, and Howard Doerffling of the U.S. cycle team. Colgan also found substantial time improvements in controlled trials on long-distance runners.





Muscle power


Optimum nutrition has been shown to increase not only endurance, but also sheer muscle power, as Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone will testify. An ardent follower of optimum nutrition, he takes handfuls of supplements every day and watches his diet carefully.

The ability to increase strength is best illustrated in a study by Dr. Colgan in which two experienced weight lifters were given a special supplement program and another two were given placebos.21 After three months, those on supplements had increased the maximum weight they could lift by about 50 percent. The others, on dummy tablets, had only a 10 to 20 percent increase. During the following three months, the supplements and the placebos were swapped around. Those previously on placebos caught up with the other weight lifters.





The right fuel


Maximizing physical performance depends on giving the body the right fuel. During sustained, less strenuous aerobic exercise (jogging, tennis, swimming, walking, for example) carbohydrates yield twice as much energy as fat. During short bursts of strenuous or anaerobic exercise (sprinting, for example), the body can really use only carbohydrate, making carbohydrate yield five times more energy than fat. Carbohydrates, not fat, are the premier fuel for performance. Also, carbohydrates can be stored as glycogen, while fat cannot. Glycogen is a short-term store of energy, held in muscles and the liver, which can be called on during extended physical performance. That is why endurance athletes eat rice or pasta or other complex carbohydrates some hours before an event to increase their glycogen stores.

Contrary to popular opinion, increasing protein intake does not improve athletic performance. Even bodybuilders who are going for maximum muscle gain need little more than the recommended 15 percent of total intake of calories in the form of protein. Consider this equation: to gain 9 lb. (4 kg) of muscle in a year requires less than 2 lb. (32 oz.; less than 1 kg) of protein, since muscle is 22 percent protein. Divide that by 365 days and all you need is 1/12 oz. (2.4 g) of protein a day. That is less than a teaspoonful or the amount provided by a few almonds or a teaspoon of tuna. Difficulty in building muscle is rarely due to a lack of protein and often the result of not taking in enough muscle-building vitamins and minerals such as zinc and vitamin B6, which help digest and use dietary protein.

While fat is not the best fuel for the body, sources of essential fats have many important benefits for athletes. They help transport oxygen and keep red blood cells, the oxygen carriers, healthy. They are vital for the immune system, which is often taxed in people who exercise a great deal. They are a backup source of energy and, according to Dr. Udo Erasmus, an expert on fat, actually increase metabolic rate. So nuts, seeds, and their oils form an important part of a high-performance diet.





Water—the forgotten nutrient


Probably the most important item in the diet of athletes is water. Muscles are 75 percent water. A loss of only 3 percent of this water causes a 10 percent drop in strength and an 8 percent loss of speed. During athletic performance, thirst sensors are inhibited, so it is easy for athletes to become dehydrated. This leads to an increase in body temperature, and energy is diverted away from muscles to cool the body down. During endurance sports, it is best to drink water to allow the body to sweat and cool down this way. However, it is even more important to hydrate the body in advance by drinking a glass of water every fifteen minutes for one to four hours before the event, depending on its length. Eating plenty of carbohydrate also helps store water because each unit of carbohydrate, stored as glycogen, is bound with nine units of water. As the glycogen is liberated to provide energy for muscles, so too is the water.





Supplementary benefit


A considerable body of research has produced results that support the benefits of nutrient supplementation for athletes. While studies testing single nutrients have often shown little or no effect, multinutrient studies using optimal, rather than government-recommended daily allowance (RDA), levels of nutrients consistently show improvement in athletic performance. As well as vitamins and minerals, semiessential nutrients such as coenzyme Q10 are an important part of a winning formula; ideal levels are 60 to 100 mg a day. The ideal amount of each nutrient to take varies from person to person and is likely to be in the same range as those given for maximizing energy and reducing stress (see this page).

However, if you do regular endurance exercise such as running or cycling, it is important to increase your intake of antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E. These help the body use oxygen and detoxify the by-products of making energy, which reduces the stress of endurance sports.

Many competitive sports people supplement creatine. Creatine is a substance in the body made of three amino acids—arginine, methionine, and glycine. Not surprisingly, meat is naturally rich in it. Creatine is also sold as a supplement, and it’s a top seller among athletes because it promotes muscle regeneration and recovery after exercise, as well as improves energy during intensive exercise.

Normally, muscle cells derive energy by breaking down ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When supplies of ATP are exhausted, for example, in a sprint, creatine can quickly replace the phosphate needed to “reload” the cell. Because muscles can work harder with extra creatine, the extra activity also results in more muscle growth as well as increased muscle size, since creatine increases water concentration in muscles. And here’s a caution. If you take creatine, it is essential to drink plenty of water, as some people experience high blood pressure if they don’t. Others also get diarrhea. While there is good evidence supporting the fact that creatine can give you the edge, it is ideally suited for athletes participating in sports in which every second counts. To this end, you need 2 to 5 grams a day, although some nutritionists recommend “loading up” for five days before an event with 20 grams.

General dietary guidelines for an athlete

Eat plenty of complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruit, vegetables, beans, and lentils, and “load up” before a long event.

Have some protein with your carbohydrate foods, for example, nuts with fruit, fish with rice.

Avoid eating too much protein, but do make sure you get enough.

Drink plenty of water before and, where possible, during events.

Follow a personalized supplement program on an ongoing basis, perhaps with extra coenzyme Q10.

Consider creatine if you are competing.
