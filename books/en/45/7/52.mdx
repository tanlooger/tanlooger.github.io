title: Thyroid problems
---




The thyroid gland, situated at the base of the throat, controls our rate of metabolism. In hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid, symptoms such as overactivity, loss of weight, and nervousness are common; in hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid, the symptoms are lack of energy, becoming overweight, and goiter, in which the throat region swells. Overstimulation of the endocrine system through living off stress and stimulants and estrogen dominance are common causes of an underactive thyroid later in life. This can also be caused by a lack of iodine, although this is rare, and taking iodine in kelp is advised to help the condition. Since the thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary and adrenal glands, the nutrients involved in hormone production and regulation for all three glands are particularly important. These are vitamins C and B complex (especially B3 and B5), manganese, and zinc. Selenium also appears to have a role to play in thyroid health, as does the amino acid tyrosine from which thyroxine is made. Often, a low dose of thyroxine is required to correct this condition.
