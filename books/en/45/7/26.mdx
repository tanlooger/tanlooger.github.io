title: Fibromyalgia
---




Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition accompanied by many symptoms, including widespread pain and fatigue. Research indicates that the painful muscles characteristic of fibromyalgia are due to reductions in energy production and in the ability of muscles to relax. Supplementing magnesium malate has been shown to reduce pain after as little as forty-eight hours. Supplement other key vitamins and minerals in a good multivitamin, plus 600 mg of magnesium malate. Finally, reduce your stress levels, learn how to relax, and increase exercise slowly.

Eat a healthy diet with plenty of magnesium-rich foods such as green vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
