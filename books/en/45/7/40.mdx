title: Irritable bowel syndrome
---




This term is used to describe intermittent diarrhea or constipation, urgency to defecate, abdominal pain, or indigestion. There are many possible contributory causes to one or more of these symptoms. They include food allergy, gut inflammation, overexcitation of the gut muscles, stress, infection, and toxic overload. It is therefore best to see a nutrition consultant who can determine which factors are relevant. Essential fats and the amino acid glutamine calm gut inflammation, antioxidants help the body detoxify, and the right mineral balance helps the muscles of the gut work properly.





Diet advice


Pursue a simple, pure diet of lightly cooked vegetables, fish, nongluten grains (rice, millet, corn, quinoa), lentils, and beans, plus ground seeds for essential fats. Avoid any suspect allergens, including wheat and dairy products, coffee, alcohol, and spices, for ten days to see if this makes a difference.
