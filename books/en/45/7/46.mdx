title: PMS
---




Premenstrual syndrome describes the occurrence of a cluster of symptoms including bloating, tiredness, irritability, depression, breast tenderness, and headaches, occurring most commonly in the week leading up to menstruation. There are three main causes: estrogen dominance and relative progesterone deficiency—corrected by natural progesterone and avoiding sources of estrogen; glucose intolerance, marked by a craving for sweet foods and stimulants; and deficiency in essential fatty acids and vitamin B6, zinc, and magnesium, which together create prostaglandins, which help balance hormone levels. While the need for these is greatest just before a period is due, it is wise to take the supplements throughout the month. If dietary and supplementary intervention does not result in significant improvement, consider seeing a nutrition consultant and having your hormone balance checked.





Diet advice


Follow the diet in this book. Eat little and often before menstruation, snacking on fruit but avoiding sugar, sweets, and stimulants. Ensure that your daily diet contains one tablespoon of cold-pressed vegetable oil rich in both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
