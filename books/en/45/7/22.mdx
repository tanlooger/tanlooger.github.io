Both child-onset diabetes and adult-onset diabetes are conditions caused by too high blood sugar. Child-onset diabetes is thought to develop through a cross-reaction between a protein in milk and beef and a protein in the pancreas. This can occur if genetically susceptible infants are fed dairy products or beef in their first few months, before their digestive tract and immune system are fully matured. Adult-onset diabetes is usually a consequence of poor eating habits (too much sugar and stimulants), often preceded by hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. Ensuring that adrenal hormones, insulin, and glucose tolerance factor are properly produced by the liver is fundamental in dealing with all forms of glucose intolerance and diabetes. Particularly important are vitamins C, B3, B5, and B6 and zinc and chromium. It is best to discuss any proposed changes in your diet with your doctor.





Diet advice


The key to a diabetic diet is to keep your blood sugar level even. This is achieved best by eating little and often, choosing foods that contain slow-releasing carbohydrates plus some protein. This means eating some nuts with fruit, “seed” vegetables like corn, peas, green beans, or whole grains, beans, or lentils, which contain both slow-releasing carbohydrate and protein. Avoid all sugar and forms of concentrated sweetness, such as concentrated fruit juice, and even excesses of faster-releasing fruit such as dates and bananas or of dried fruit. Also avoid too many adrenal stimulants such as tea, coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and salt.
