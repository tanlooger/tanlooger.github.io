title: Alzheimer’s and dementia
---




Like many degenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s stems primarily from not looking after your diet and lifestyle. The actual damage in the brain is caused by inflammation linked to too many oxidants, blood sugar problems, raised Cortisol, high homocysteine, and exposure to toxic metals. These include aluminum, copper, and mercury. Trace amounts of mercury can cause the type of damage to nerves that is characteristic of Alzheimer’s. If you are experiencing significant decline in mental function and have a mouth full of amalgam fillings, I’d recommend you seriously consider having them replaced. One of the best predictors of dementia and Alzheimer’s risk is your blood level of homocysteine. If it’s high, supplementing large amounts of B6 (100 mg), B12 (100 mcg), and folic acid (800 mcg) helps lower it.





Diet advice


Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (aim for a mix of all colors, combining blueberries, beets, carrots, yellow peppers, and green vegetables), seeds, and fish such as mackerel, salmon, or tuna, rich in omega-3 and vitamin E. Eat whole foods, and avoid refined foods and sugar, smoking, alcohol, and fried foods.
