These are accumulations of calcium or cholesterol in the duct running from the liver to the gallbladder, which stores bile used for digesting fats. If this duct is blocked, fats cannot be properly absorbed and jaundice occurs. It is not excesses of calcium or cholesterol in the diet that are to blame, but rather how these substances are dealt with in the body. Often, gallstone victims have inherited very narrow bile ducts, increasing their risk of this condition. Lecithin helps to emulsify cholesterol, and optimum nutrition in general should help prevent such abnormalities occurring. Digestive enzyme supplements contain lipase to help digest fat.
