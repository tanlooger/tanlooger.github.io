title: Burns, cuts, and bruises
---




All these conditions require skin to heal, which depends on a good supply of vitamins A, C, and E and zinc and bioflavonoids. These reduce bruising, speed up healing, and minimize scar tissue. Vitamin E oil can be rubbed around, but not on, cuts and burns; you can get it by piercing a vitamin E capsule. Also useful are creams rich in vitamin A, C, or E in a form that can penetrate the skin, such as retinyl, ascorbyl, or locopheryl palmitate.
