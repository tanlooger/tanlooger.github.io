title: Sinusitis
---




An inflammation of the sinus and nasal passages, sinusitis often leads to sinus infections. Contributory factors are nasal irritants such as exhaust fumes, cigarettes, smoky places, dust, and pollen; allergies, often to dairy products and wheat, which are mucus forming; plus a weakened immune system. Too much alcohol, fried food, or stress; lack of sleep; and overeating all weaken the immune system. Vitamins A and C and zinc, among other nutrients, help boost immunity. Essential fats are also needed to control inflammation.





Diet advice


Eat lightly, but do eat—lots of essential foods such as the best organic fruit and vegetables (baby vegetables, just sprouted), plus seeds. You do need protein (from quinoa, seeds, nuts, fish, tofu, and so on) but avoid mucus-forming foods such as milk, eggs, and meat.

Also inhale tea tree oil or Olbas Oil, in the bath or by holding it under your nose (be careful not to irritate the skin too much) to stop your nasal passages from blocking. Tiger balm is good on the chest. Drink homemade ginger and cinnamon tea (five slices of fresh ginger root and one stick of cinnamon in a thermos with 1 cup of boiling water) or cat’s claw tea to boost the immune system.
