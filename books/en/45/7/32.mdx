title: Headaches and migraines
---




There are many causes of headaches and migraines, ranging from blood sugar drops, dehydration, and allergy, to stress and tension, or a critical combination. Peaks and troughs in adrenaline and blood sugar can bring on a headache. Often headaches go away with optimum nutrition. If they persist, look carefully at the possibility of allergy. See if you can notice any correlation between the foods you eat and the incidence of headaches.

For migraine sufferers, instead of taking an aspirin or migraine drugs that constrict the blood vessels, try taking 100 to 200 mg of vitamin B3 in the niacin form, which is a vasodilator. Start with the smaller dose: this will often stop or reduce a migraine in the early stages. It is best to do this at home in a relaxed environment so the customary warm blushing sensation will probably not bother you.
