title: HIV infection and AIDS
---




The main focus of current research is on antioxidant nutrients that strengthen the immune system. Leading researcher Dr. Raxit Jariwalla from the Linus Pauling Institute in California has shown vitamin C’s ability to suppress the HIV virus in laboratory cultures of infected cells. He found that with continuous exposure to ascorbic acid (vitamin C), in concentrations not harmful to cells, the growth of HIV in immune cells could be reduced by 99.5 percent. Dr. Jariwalla suggests that in healthy humans a daily dose of at least 10 g is needed for an antiviral effect. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an altered form of the amino acid cysteine that is a powerful antioxidant, has also been found to have antiviral properties. Dr. Jariwalla discovered that adding vitamin C to NAC created an eightfold increase in anti-HIV activity.





Diet advice
