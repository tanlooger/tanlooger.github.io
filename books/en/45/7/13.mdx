title: Candidiasis
---




The overgrowth of Candida albicans, a yeastlike fungus, can occur anywhere in the body, most commonly in the digestive tract or the vagina, and causes thrush or yeast infection. Mild overgrowth can be eliminated by a four-point plan: antifungal agents such as caprylic acid and grapefruit seed extract; supplementation of beneficial bacteria; an immune-boosting diet and supplements; and an “anticandida” diet (see below). It is usually best to work with a nutrition consultant, who can confirm the extent of the infection with proper tests.





Diet advice


Avoid all sources of sugar and especially fast-releasing sugars (including fruit for the first month). Also stay away from yeast-containing foods, mushrooms, and fermented foods such as alcohol and vinegar. Intake of wheat is often best reduced since it irritates the gut. This means living off vegetables, grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. It is worth getting a good anticandida recipe book!
