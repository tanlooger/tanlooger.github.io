title: Dermatitis
---




This condition literally means “skin inflammation” and is similar to eczema. Usually the term “dermatitis” is used when the primary cause appears to be a contact allergy. Go through all possibilities such as metals in jewelry and watches, perfumes, cosmetics, detergents, soaps, and shampoos. Where there is a contact allergy there is often a food allergy too: common culprits are dairy products and wheat. Sometimes a combination of eating an allergy-provoking food and contact with an external allergen is needed in order for symptoms to develop. Another frequently encountered factor is a lack of essential fatty acids from seeds and their oils, which in the body turn into anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. Their formation is also blocked by too much saturated fat or fried food or a lack of certain key vitamins and minerals. The skin is also a route that the body can use to get rid of toxins. A certain kind of dermatitis, called acrodermatitis, responds exceptionally well to zinc supplementation and is primarily caused by zinc deficiency.





Diet advice


Generally a vegan-type diet, low in saturated fat but with enough essential fats from seeds, is best. If you suspect an allergy to dairy products or wheat, test for this by avoiding these foods.
