title: Acne
---




This condition is most prevalent among teenagers, and the hormonal changes that take place at this age are certainly at the root of many skin problems. These changes cause the sebaceous glands to produce too much sebum and keratin, which block up the skin pores making them more likely to get infected. A diet high in saturated fat or fried food also makes pores more likely to get blocked. Vitamin A deficiency produces skin congestion through excessive keratinization of skin cells. Vitamin A and zinc deficiency leads to lowered ability to fight infection, as does lack of beneficial bacteria (through overuse of antibiotics). Optimum nutrition helps by balancing hormones as well as reducing the risk of infection. The most important nutrients are vitamins A, B complex (especially B6), C, and E, zinc, niacin for skin flushing, and vitamin E for wound healing. Good diet and cleanliness are essential. Be careful of supplements with added iodine, which can make acne worse.





Diet advice


Follow an optimum diet and drink plenty of water. Sulfur-rich foods such as eggs, onions, and garlic are also helpful. Avoid sugar, cigarettes, and fried and high-fat foods. Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (high-water-content foods).
