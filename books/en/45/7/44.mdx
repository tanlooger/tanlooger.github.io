title: Obesity
---




As well as eating no more than you need, choosing foods that keep the blood sugar even, backed up by an optimal intake of nutrients that help stabilize blood sugar, will help you lose weight by stabilizing your appetite and burning fat. These nutrients include vitamins B3, B6, and C and zinc and chromium. Konjac fiber, a source of glucomannan, also helps to stabilize blood sugar levels. Also helpful is HCA, which slows down the ability of the body to turn excess fuel into body fat, and 5-HTP, which stabilizes appetite. In some people, food allergies cause water retention that can contribute to obesity. If you suspect any foods, the most common being wheat and dairy products, eliminate them for ten days to test whether they are associated with your weight gain. Thyroid problems can also be a factor in obesity. If all else fails, ask your doctor to check your thyroid.





Diet advice


Follow the diet in this book, emphasizing high-water-content foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and slow-releasing carbohydrates (see part 9). Avoid all sources of fast-releasing sugars. Experiment with fasting one day a week or sticking to fruit only. Make aerobic exercise a regular part of your day.
