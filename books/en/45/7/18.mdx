title: Crohn’s disease
---




Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disorder that responds very well to nutritional therapy. A few factors should be considered. Sensitivity to certain foods, most commonly gluten (the protein found in wheat, oats, rye, and barley) and milk, can aggravate Crohn’s, so avoiding them can help. The amount of good bacteria in the gut is likely to be low, so restore the balance with a probiotic supplement such as Lactobacillus acidophilus. Taking some omega-3-rich fish or flax oil helps calm the inflammation. Certain herbs such as slippery elm or marshmallow are very soothing to the gut lining, while others such as boswellia and curcumin can reduce inflammation. The amino acid glutamine, 5 to 10 grams taken as a powder in water last thing at night, also helps repair the gut.

Most people with Crohn’s are allergic to certain foods, most commonly gluten, and also have raised homocysteine levels. It is well worth working with a nutritional therapist, who can test for these factors and help you find your perfect diet and supplement program.

You can’t avoid fiber completely and wouldn’t want to. Fiber is a natural constituent of a healthy diet high in fruit, vegetables, lentils, beans, and whole grains, and by eating such a diet you have less risk of bowel cancer, diabetes, or diverticular disease and are unlikely to suffer from constipation. However, be really careful with insoluble fiber found in bran and whole grains. It’s harsh on the bowel and doesn’t suit a sensitive or inflamed digestive system. There are, however, many different kinds of fiber. Soluble fibers, found in oats, lentils, beans, fruit, vegetables, and flaxseeds (which you should continue to eat plenty of), are another story. Foods rich in soluble fiber contain many other nutrients as well, so are an important part of any healthy diet, including the diets of Crohn’s sufferers.





Diet advice


Avoid coffee, alcohol, and sugar, drink 1.5 quarts of water daily, and eat fresh whole foods that are naturally high in soluble fiber, such as lentils, beans, ground seeds, fruit, and lightly cooked vegetables. Have ground flaxseeds or soaked flaxseeds.
