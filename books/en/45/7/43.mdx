title: Muscle aches and cramps
---




Cramps are most commonly due to calcium-magnesium imbalances and are corrected by supplementing 500 mg of calcium and 300 mg of magnesium. Despite popular belief, the condition is very rarely due to a lack of salt. In fact, it is best to avoid added salt and to keep fluid intake high. Fruit is naturally rich in potassium and water and contains sufficient sodium for the body’s needs. Muscle aches can occur for the same reason or when muscle cells are not able to make energy efficiently from glucose. Magnesium, particularly in the form of magnesium malate, helps here too, as do B vitamins. Aches can also occur as a result of inflammation (see this page).
