title: Hay fever
---




Even though allergic reactions to pollen are the identified cause of hay fever, other factors make one person more likely to sneeze than another. The incidence of hay fever has risen dramatically in cities compared with rural areas, which led to the discovery that pollutants such as exhaust fumes prime the immune system to react. During the summer, the air in polluted areas contains more free radicals due to the action of sunlight on oxygen molecules, so city dwellers breathe in more pollutants. Taking a good all-round antioxidant supplement containing vitamins A, C, and E, beta-carotene, selenium, and zinc, plus the amino acids cysteine or glutathione, helps increase your resistance (the most effective forms of these amino acids are N-acetyl cysteine, sometimes called NAC, and “reduced” glutathione). The amino acid methionine, in combination with calcium, is an effective antihistamine. You need to take 500 mg of L-methionine with 400 mg of calcium twice a day. Vitamin C helps control excessive histamine levels. vitamin B6 and zinc have a role to play in balancing histamine levels and strengthening the immune system. vitamin B5 helps reduce symptoms.

The three most common substances reacted to are pollen, wheat, and milk. Although there is no proven connection, it is interesting to note that all these are originally grass products. It may be that some hay fever sufferers become sensitized to proteins that are common to grains, grasses, and possibly milk. In any event, dairy products encourage mucus production. Similarly, modern strains of wheat are high in gluten, which irritates the digestive tract and stimulates mucus production.





Diet advice


Avoid or at least limit wheat, dairy products, and alcohol. Eat plenty of antioxidant-rich fruit and vegetables, plus seeds rich in selenium and zinc. Where possible, avoid exposure to pollen and traffic fumes.
