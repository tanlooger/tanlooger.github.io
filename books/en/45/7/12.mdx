There are many different kinds of cancer, with different causes. Most cancers are associated with exposure to or ingestion of cancer-causing agents, coupled with immune insufficiency Often there is an association with free radical damage of cells, which then become cancerous. Depending on the type of cancer, the first step is to eliminate cancer-stimulating agents such as smoking, a high-fat diet, HRT, excessive exposure to sunlight or pesticides, a high-meat diet, alcohol, and so on. The next step is to build up the strength of the immune system with diet and supplements and to increase your intake of antioxidant nutrients.





Diet advice


Stick strictly to the diet advice in this book. Increase the amount of high-antioxidant foods you eat (see this page). Cut out red meat and alcohol and reduce your intake of all sources of saturated fat. A vegan-type diet is best. Also, drink plenty of water and herb tea, especially cat’s claw, which is a potent immune booster.
