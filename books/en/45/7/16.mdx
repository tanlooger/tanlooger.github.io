In this condition, part of the large intestine is inflamed. It is often stress induced; however, it can also be due to poor diet, poor elimination, an allergy, or suboptimum nutrition. Since there is inflammation, the first step is to reduce any aggravating foods including alcohol, coffee, and wheat. These can be replaced by foods and drinks that pass easily through the digestive tract, such as steamed vegetables, rice, fish, and fruit, plus digestive enzyme supplements. Essential fats rich in GLA are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. Antioxidants also help reduce inflammation.





Diet advice


While the diet recommended in this book is a good one, the high fiber content can act as an irritant in this condition. So a diet of lightly steamed vegetables, fish, and cooked grains is often preferable, with easy-to-digest fruit as snacks. Avoid all digestive irritants, which can include any food you are allergic to, wheat, alcohol, coffee, and spices.
