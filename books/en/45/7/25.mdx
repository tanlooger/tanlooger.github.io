title: Eczema
---




In this unpleasant condition, the skin becomes scaly and itchy; it can crack and be very sore. Dermatitis is very similar in nature and probably also in cause. The possibility of allergy must be strongly considered. Although the mechanism is unknown, optimum nutrition does usually help this condition. Vitamins A and C strengthen the skin, while vitamin E and zinc improve healing. When there is no open wound, vitamin E oil can help heal the skin. Essential fats also help reduce inflammation.





Diet advice


Generally a vegan-type diet, low in saturated fat and with sufficient essential fats from seeds, is best. If you suspect an allergy to dairy products or wheat, test for it by avoiding these foods.
