These can occur in the stomach and duodenum—the first section of the small intestine, which is not as well protected as the rest of the intestines against the acid secretions of the stomach. In prolonged stress, the stomach can over-secrete acid, so stress can be a cause. Also, diets that are too acid forming are to be avoided. Vitamin A is the primary nutrient needed to protect the lining of the duodenum. While vitamin C does help people with duodenal ulcers, not more than 500 mg should be taken as it can cause irritation. If a burning sensation is experienced after taking vitamin C, the dose is too high. The most common cause of ulcers is infection with Helicobacter pylori. This should be tested for by your doctor and treated with a specific antibacterial agent. Also, check for food allergies.
