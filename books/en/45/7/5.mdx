title: Anemia

Anemia can be caused by iron, B12, or folic acid deficiency. A blood test can determine if you have such deficiencies. Iron is needed in the body to make hemoglobin—a key part of blood responsible for the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to your tissues, brain, muscles, and organs. If you’re low in iron, you can’t make enough red blood cells, hence your pale appearance, and with fewer red blood cells, your brain and body don’t get the levels of oxygen and other nutrients they need. If you’re low in folic acid or B12, the hemoglobin is misshapen and doesn’t work properly. The result? Tiredness.

Two simple tests of your iron status involve your eyelids and fingernails. Look in the area under your lower eyelids—it should be a rich pink/red color, not pale; press on the end of your fingernail, turning the bed white—it should come back to red quickly when you release it, not stay pale.





Diet advice


Red meat is well known as a good source of iron, but can also be rich in saturated fat. Sources that do not have a high fat content include eggs, spinach and other greens, beans, lentils, prunes, dried apricots, molasses, and pumpkin seeds, so eat plenty of these, as well as green vegetables and beans, which are rich in folate. Only foods of animal origin contain vitamin B12.
