title: Hair problems
---




There are many different kinds of hair problems, from dry or oily hair to premature hair loss, but most are linked to what you eat. Oily hair can occur with vitamin B deficiency. Dry or brittle hair is often a sign of essential fat deficiency. Poor hair growth, or loss of color, is a sign of zinc deficiency. Hair loss is connected with general nutritional deficiency, especially a lack of iron, vitamin B1, vitamin C, or lysine (an amino acid). Some hair supplements contain all these. Massaging the scalp also helps, as does hanging upside down, including doing headstands and “inversion” poses in yoga, which improve circulation to the scalp. The combination of optimum nutrition, stimulating scalp circulation, and correcting underlying hormonal imbalances (see chapter 25) has proved the most effective answer for hair loss. Unfortunately, there is no answer yet for gray hair nor any apparent connection with nutrition.
