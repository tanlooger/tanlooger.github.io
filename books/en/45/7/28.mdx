This is caused by improper metabolism of proteins, resulting in uric acid crystals being deposited in fingers, toes, and joints and causing inflammation. Diets low in fat and moderate in protein help this condition, as does exercise. However, the many nutrients involved in protein metabolism, especially B6 and zinc, are also an essential part of a nutritional program for preventing gout.
