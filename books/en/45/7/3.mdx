title: Allergies
---




“Allergy” is a word that often invokes connotations beyond its original meaning. An allergy is an intolerance to a particular substance. We have an intolerance to coffee, for example, if large amounts produce symptoms. Some people have more pronounced symptoms, even in reaction to simple foods like wheat or milk. Since an allergy is like an addiction, it is often the foods that one is most “addicted” to that are suspect. If you feel that you might have allergies but do not know what they are, it is best to see a nutrition consultant or an allergy specialist who can test you and solve any underlying digestive imbalances that provoke allergies. Optimum nutrition will greatly reduce or clear up allergic reactions in most cases. Vitamin C, calcium, and magnesium help reduce the severity of allergic reactions. L-glutamine heals the gut and supports the immune system, reducing allergic potential.





Diet advice


Follow a general healthy diet. Avoid suspect foods, dairy products, and grains (the most common allergens), especially wheat. After two months you may be able to reintroduce suspect foods every fourth day without having a reaction. Eventually, you may be able to tolerate your allergens in small amounts on a daily basis.
