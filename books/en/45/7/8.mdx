This inflammatory condition affects the lungs and respiration and is characterized by difficulty in breathing and frequent coughing. Often attacks are brought on by underlying allergies, stressful events, or changes in environmental conditions like the weather. Vitamin A helps protect the lining of the lungs, while vitamin C helps deal with environmental toxins. Antioxidant nutrients and essential fats are anti-inflammatory.
