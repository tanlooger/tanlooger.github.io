title: Psoriasis
---




This is a completely different kind of skin condition from eczema or dermatitis and does not generally respond as well to nutritional intervention. It can occur when the body is “toxic,” perhaps owing to an overgrowth of the organism Candida albicans, to digestive problems leading to toxicity, or to poor liver detoxification. Otherwise, consider the factors discussed for dermatitis and eczema (see this page and this page).
