title: Diverticulitis
---




This is a condition of the small and large intestine, in which pockets in the intestinal wall become distended and are then more likely to get infected and inflamed. The condition, probably the result of not enough fiber and exercise, is rarely seen in primitive cultures. A general vitamin program is recommended to support the muscle tone surrounding the intestines and to maintain a strong infection-fighting system. Increased soluble fiber and regular exercise such as swimming are the key treatments.





Diet advice


Follow the recommended diet in this book, with particular reference to the high-fiber foods (see part 9). However, if the inflammation is severe, it is best to eat lightly steamed vegetables, oats (which contain soluble fiber), and ground seeds or nuts and to stay away from added “hard” fibers like wheat bran. It is best to soak grain like oats so as to maximize their water content; these foods provide fiber without irritating the inflamed area. Also have a cold-pressed oil blend rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, as these help calm down inflammation.
