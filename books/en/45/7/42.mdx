These include fatigue, depression, weight gain, osteoporosis, reduced sex drive, vaginal dryness, and hot flashes. While optimum nutrition often helps relieve these, many women respond to small amounts of natural progesterone used as a cream. This is available over the counter in the U.S. Supplementing vitamin C with vitamin E and bioflavonoids may help reduce hot flashes. Also important for this and other symptoms, including vaginal dryness, are sufficient essential fatty acids, which make the prostaglandins that help balance hormone levels. For prostaglandins to work, sufficient vitamin B6, zinc, and magnesium are required.





Diet advice
