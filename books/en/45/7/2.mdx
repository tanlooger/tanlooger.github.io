title: Alcoholism
---




Particularly prevalent among histadelic (high-histamine) people (see this page), alcoholism may in part be a way of coping with the excess energy that such individuals produce. B vitamins, especially Bl, B2, B3, and B6, are destroyed by alcohol, which primarily affects the liver and nervous system. Vitamins A and C help protect the liver. Glutamine heals the gut and reduces cravings. A very alkaline diet reduces the craving for alcohol. Tyrosine and adaptogens help prevent emotional and physicals lows after stopping. Emotional problems almost always underlie alcoholism, and these, as well as the addiction—which usually also exists for sugar—must be addressed.





Diet advice


Follow the recommended diet and eat plenty of whole grains, beans, and lentils. Drink plenty of water. Often, sugar addiction is substituted for dependency on alcohol, which is just another form of sugar, so sugar and stimulants are also best avoided. Eat frequent meals containing some protein foods such as nuts, seeds, fish, chicken, eggs, or milk products.
