title: Osteoporosis

In this condition, the density of the bones decreases, increasing the risk of fracture and compression of the spinal vertebrae. From a nutritional perspective, there are three main contributors. These are excessive protein consumption, leading to leaching of calcium from the bone to neutralize excess blood acidity; relative dominance of estrogen to progesterone, the latter being a major trigger for bone growth; and deficiency of bone-building nutrients, which include calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, silica, phosphorus, and boron. The use of natural progesterone cream, available over the counter, has proved four times more effective than synthetic estrogen HRT in restoring bone density.
