title: Inflammation
---




Many health problems, including all those ending in “itis,” are inflammatory. This means that a part of the body such as a muscle or joint, the gut, or the respiratory tract, is inflamed. This is a sign that the body is reacting, or overreacting, to something. A tendency to overreact can arise if a person is deficient in essential fats and their supportive nutrients, vitamins B3 and B6, biotin, vitamin C, zinc, and magnesium. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is also needed to make Cortisol, the body’s anti-inflammatory hormone. Boswellic acid, found in the plant frankincense, is a natural anti-inflammatory agent that is available in the form of a cream for inflamed joints and muscles. L-glutamine helps to calm gut inflammation. Antioxidant nutrients are also intimately involved in inflammatory responses. However, there is little point in calming down an inflammation if the source of irritation remains. This may be a food allergy or an irritating substance such as alcohol.
