title: Breast cancer
---




Most breast cancers are hormonally related, linked to estrogen dominance and progesterone deficiency. Stress, excessive use of stimulants, and exposure to pesticides all disrupt hormone balance. Some forms of breast cancer, however, are linked more to carcinogens. Antioxidant nutrients have been shown to decrease risk and increase survival. Use of natural progesterone has been shown to reverse the proliferation of tumor cells. See your doctor or a nutrition consultant to get your hormone levels tested and consider natural progesterone cream.





Diet advice


Follow the diet in this book, with an emphasis on foods high in antioxidants, avoiding milk and meat, beef in particular, because of their IGF hormone content, and eating organic as much as possible. Have plenty of phytoestrogen-rich foods—beans, lentils, seeds, and nuts—and lots of fresh organic fruit and vegetables. Keep saturated fat very low and ensure you have adequate essential fats from seeds and their cold-pressed oils.
