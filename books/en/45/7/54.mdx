title: Varicose veins
---




Veins carry blood returning to the heart. A varicose vein is one that has become enlarged and swollen; the condition usually occurs in the legs, where circulation is most difficult. It is unlikely that optimum nutrition can do much for veins that are already varicose; however, adequate vitamins C and E as well as other antioxidants can help prevent further occurrences. Also, there is some evidence that a high-fiber diet can help prevent varicose veins.





Diet advice


Follow the diet recommended in this book. Regular exercise, especially swimming, will improve the circulation. Putting your feet up and gentle leg massages are all helpful. Application of vitamin E cream is beneficial.
