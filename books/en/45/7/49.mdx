title: Schizophrenia

This severe form of mental health problem is suffered by one in a hundred people. There are many causes, the majority of which can be alleviated by nutrition. It is strongly advised that you see a nutrition consultant who can run tests to determine whether biochemical imbalances may underlie this condition. Nutrients that can help include folic acid, essential fatty acids, and megadoses of niacin (B3). These do not help all sufferers and can make certain types of the condition worse—hence the need for testing. Often there is an underlying glucose imbalance and allergies.
