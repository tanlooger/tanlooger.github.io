title: Sleeping problems
---




For some sufferers, the major problem of insomnia is waking up in the middle of the night; for others it is not getting to sleep in the first place. Both can be the effect on the nervous system of poor nutrition or too much stress and anxiety. Calcium and magnesium have a tranquilizing effect, as does vitamin B6. Tryptophan, a constituent of protein, has the strongest tranquilizing effect and, if taken in doses of 1,000 to 3,000 mg, it is highly effective for insomnia. It takes about an hour to work and remains effective for up to four hours. While tryptophan is nonaddictive and has no known side effects, its regular use in not recommended—it is better to adjust your lifestyle so that no tranquilizing agents are needed.
