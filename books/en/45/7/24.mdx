title: Ear infections
---




Infections of this kind are most frequently the result of an underlying allergy. An allergic reaction induces inflammation that blocks the thin tube that runs from the sinuses to the ears. Once this swells and blocks, the inner ear chamber becomes a favorite site for infection. Treatment with antibiotics quadruples the risk of another infection. This may be because antibiotics irritate the gut wall, making it more leaky, which exacerbates underlying allergies.





Diet advice


Follow the diet recommended in this book. Eat and drink plenty of fruit, vegetables, and their juices. Drink plenty of water, herb teas, and three cups of cat’s claw tea a day. Stay away from mucus-forming foods—dairy products, meat, and eggs. Dairy allergy is the single most common cause of ear infections.





Supplements


2 × multivitamin and multimineral

2 × antioxidant complex

3 × vitamin C 1,000 mg

Echinacea 10 drops twice a day

Aloe vera a measure a day as instructed on the bottle (get the best, since the concentration of active ingredient varies a lot)

Grapefruit seed extract 10 drops twice a day



Scale these amounts down, according to weight, for children. Give a child weighing 60 lb. (half an average adult), for instance, 5 drops of both echinacea and grapefruit seed extract, 500 mg of vitamin C three times a day (1,500 mg in total), and a children’s multivitamin and multimineral and antioxidant complex.
