title: Herpes
---




The herpes virus feeds off an amino acid called arginine. If you supplement lysine, an amino acid that looks like arginine, you fool the virus and effectively starve it. I recommend supplementing 1,000 mg of lysine every day, away from food, to keep the virus at bay. When you have an active infection, supplement 3,000 mg of lysine a day and cut back on foods rich in arginine, which include beans, lentils, nuts, and chocolate. The more stressed you are, the weaker your immune system becomes and the more chances the virus has to become active. A good way to boost your immune system is to supplement 2,000 mg of vitamin C every day. Some people also find MSM reduces an infection. It’s worth trying if lysine doesn’t clear things up.





Diet advice


Avoid arginine-rich foods during an attack. These include beans, lentils, nuts, and chocolate.
