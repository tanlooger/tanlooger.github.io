Foreword




Milton Erickson’s teaching tales—the stories he told his patients and the stories he told the pilgrims who came to sit at his feet—are ingenious and enchanting. They are extraordinary examples of the art of persuasion. Some people would say that they are much too good to be tucked away on the psychiatry shelf, since even though their intention was therapeutic, they are part of a much larger tradition: the American tradition of wit and humor whose greatest exemplar is Mark Twain.

I first became aware of the amazing exploits of Erickson when I began to work as a writer and editor at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto in 1963. I was putting together the material for the book Techniques of Family Therapy with Jay Haley. Haley, who had taped hours of conversation with Erickson, told me story after story about him, while I listened entranced. This was part of my initiation into the field of family therapy, and it made a big impact on me. It is all the more an honor, then, eighteen years later, to be asked to write the foreword to Sidney Rosen’s compilation of Erickson’s teaching tales.

Because of the curious way Erickson stands on the line between healer and poet, scientist and bard, it is difficult to describe his work. Transcripts of his seminars, though wonderful, are to some extent unsatisfying. The written word simply cannot convey the pauses, smiles, and piercing upward glances with which Erickson punctuates his narratives, nor can it record his mastery of voice and tone. The written word, in short, cannot give any idea of the way Erickson insinuates himself.

Sidney Rosen has solved this problem, although I am not sure how he has done it. Erickson chose him, as disciple, as colleague, and as friend, to edit this volume. His intuition, as usual, was correct. Rosen has a way of taking you by the hand and insinuating you into Erickson’s presence. There seems to be no obstruction. I once watched an underwater swimming show in Florida. The audience sat in an underground amphitheater that was separated by a pane of glass from a limestone spring. The water was so clear and transparent that the fish that swam close to the glass seemed to be gliding through air.

Reading this book was a similar experience, perhaps because Rosen gives us such a strong sense of the relational field that was Erickson’s own natural medium. The first line of the first chapter is a remark from Erickson to Rosen on the nature of the unconscious. Just as Erickson weaves into his tales reminiscences, personal biography, odd thoughts, or unusual facts, so Rosen weaves into his commentary bits about this or that personal encounter with Erickson, associations to some particular tale, and ways he himself has used these stories in his own work with patients, and he also gives a running explication of the various techniques exemplified by the tales. The commentary is the relational field in which the stories are suspended.

In addition, Rosen seems to be speaking, not writing, again paralleling Erickson, and his style is friendly and nontechnical. It is also quite plain. Whether deliberately or not, Rosen creates a frame that is neutral enough to highlight the color and brilliance of the stories. Nevertheless, the totality transcends the effect of any one element. Thoughtful attention is paid to each anecdote, and a skilled and experienced hypnotherapist who himself is a gifted practitioner of Ericksonian techniques gives us a book that is, in effect, a teaching tale about a teaching tale.

Let me give a sense here of the way the commentary flows in and out of the tales, taking the first part of Chapter Three, “Trust the Unconscious,” as my source. This chapter begins with a short anecdote about Erickson’s having to give a speech on the spur of the moment and saying to himself that he didn’t have to prepare, because he had confidence in the storehouse of ideas and experience he had built up over the years. Rosen underlines this theme of trust in one’s unconsciously stored powers, and then includes a short vignette, “Light Snow,” haunting in its simplicity, about a childhood memory and the memory of when that memory was laid down. This story is followed by two more on the same theme. The last story is about Erickson’s not talking when he was four, and his mother’s saying to people made uncomfortable by this fact, “When the time arrives, then he will talk.” Rosen cuts back in briefly to say that this story is a good one to use with patients just learning how to go into trance.

The next story is splendid. It is called “Scratching Hogs.” It describes a time when Erickson, who as a young man sold books to pay his way through college, was trying to sell some to a crusty old farmer. The man isn’t having any and tells Erickson to go about his business. Erickson, without thinking, picks up some shingles from the ground and starts scratching the backs of the hogs the farmer is feeding. The farmer changes his mind and agrees to buy Erickson’s books because, as he says, “You know how to scratch hogs.”

This is followed by Rosen’s commenting on the story and moving on to the occasion when he first heard it—after he had asked Erickson why he chose Rosen to write the foreword to his book Hypnotherapy. After explaining just what things about Rosen had made him wish to entrust the writing of a foreword to him, Erickson added, “I like the way you scratch a hog.”

This fragment gives an idea of the tapestried richness of the book. Each tale is treated as a precious object in a collection, full of memories, and Rosen shares with the reader the different meanings they evoke for him, both as a person and as a clinician. If I were a canny fellow like that farmer, I would buy this book. Sidney Rosen does know how to scratch a hog.

Editor’s Note




On Thursday, March 27, 1980, my New York office called me and gave me the news that Milton Erickson had died. I was on a skiing vacation in Snowbird, Utah. My first thoughts were of Betty Erickson, and I called her. I learned that Erickson had finished his regular week of teaching on Friday, had autographed twelve books, and on Saturday had been somewhat tired during the day. Early Sunday morning, he suddenly stopped breathing. Betty Erickson applied artificial respiration and reinstated his breathing. A paramedic squad worked with her and took him to the hospital, where his blood pressure, which showed a systolic level of about forty, could not be elevated, even with the help of dopamine infusions. It was determined that Erickson was suffering from “septic shock.” A beta-streptococcus infection was diagnosed, and it was manifested as a peritonitis. He did not respond to massive doses of antibiotics.

Erickson’s family congregated from all over the United States. It is a very devoted and large one, consisting of four sons and four daughters, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Family members stayed with him while he was in a semicomatose state. From their accounts, it appears probable that he died as he had often said he wanted to—with a smile on his face, surrounded by friends and family. He was seventy-eight years old.

About the funeral services, Betty Erickson said, “Don’t put yourself out, Sid. It will only be a small gathering. And I know that some people are planning memorial services in different cities.” Fortunately, I was able to drive to the Salt Lake City airport and arrive in Phoenix after a short flight. The calm and warmth of the Phoenix day was in marked contrast to the windy cold of the mountain I had just left.

It was only a small gathering. Erickson’s body had been cremated, and the ashes were to be scattered on Squaw Peak. Four people spoke at the service—Jeffrey Zeig, Robert Pearson, Kay Thompson, and Ernest Rossi. I recall Pearson’s final comment: “Erickson took on the psychiatric establishment single-handedly, and he beat them. They don’t know it yet…” Rossi recited the dream in song and verse, that had awakened him in tears just before he had received the phone call from Phoenix, with the news of Erickson’s death.

After the services, Betty Erickson said that she had something for me. It was an exchange of letters between Erickson and Salvador Minuchin. Minuchin had met Erickson for the first time only about a week before his death. Erickson had never read the last letter, but Betty Erickson had dutifully answered it. She had asked Minuchin for permission for me to use his letters in this book, and Minuchin had graciously agreed.

The last letter begins, “My meeting with you was one of those memorable experiences. In my lifetime, I have met a handful of extraordinary people—you are one of them.”

It continues, “I was tremendously impressed with the way in which you are able to look at simple moments and describe their complexity, and at your trust in the capacity of human beings to harness a repertory of experiences they do not know they have.”




During my visit to Phoenix in 1979, I had been invited to sleep in the small cottage that is adjacent to Erickson’s office. I took the opportunity to look through books in his library and was impressed that many of these books had been inscribed to him by their authors, with messages of gratitude. These books dealt with many fields—not only with the fields of hypnosis and psychotherapy. For example, there were books about Gurdjieff, about city planning, and about literature. The authors’ inscriptions to Erickson often bordered on the ecstatic—such as “Thank you for teaching me the difference between knowledge and knowing.”

To those, like myself, who have been following the works of Erickson since the 1940s and 1950s, it was gratifying to know that as he was nearing the age of eighty, he was finally recognized by a larger audience and that his techniques and approaches would be of benefit to many more people. Of course, in professional hypnosis circles, Erickson had long been known as a leader. He was the founding editor of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis. In the 1950s he wrote the article on hypnosis for the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Professionals often called upon him for advice on hypnosis and altered states of consciousness. He hypnotized Aldous Huxley in the 1950s and collaborated with him on his study of altered states of consciousness. Margaret Mead studied with him for more than forty years and, in fact, became a member of the Society of Clinical Hypnosis. In the 1940s Life magazine discussed Erickson’s work. In 1952 he was an active participant in the Macy Conferences, during which authorities like Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, and Lawrence Kubie, the eminent psychoanalyst, discussed matters that led to the formation of the field of cybernetics. Still, most lay people and even many psychotherapists had never heard of him; when the name “Erickson” was mentioned, they would usually say, “Oh, yes, Erik Erikson?”

An upsurge of interest in Milton Erickson was stimulated by the writings of Jay Haley, who studied with Erickson for seventeen years and became a leader in the field of family therapy. More recently, Erickson’s ideas have been spread by the writings and workshops of Richard Bandler and John Grinder.

A long list of candidates wished to attend the group meetings held by Erickson. Anyone calling Erickson in his last year was told that there was a wait of over one year and that no further reservations would be made until after the International Congress on Ericksonian Hypnosis, which was to be held in Phoenix in December 1980.

When I presented his work to professional audiences, with demonstrations of hypnosis, sometimes with the aid of videotapes, I found that many were eager to visit Erickson themselves. Since this was impossible for most, I wondered what aspect of his teaching would best give them, and others, a sense of personal contact with him, while conveying the essence of his therapeutic approaches.

I recalled a conversation in 1978, between Erickson and one of the psychiatrists who attended his seminars. At one point Erickson had turned to the psychiatrist and, with a slight smile, had asked, “Do you still think that therapy is just telling stories?” Now, it is obvious that even though Erickson’s therapy was not only “telling stories,” the telling of what I call his “teaching tales” was one of the major elements in his therapy.

In August of 1979, Milton Erickson gave me permission to write a book on his “teaching tales.” By November he had agreed to be co-author of the book, and our publishing contract was signed about three months before his death.

The “teaching tales” are stories that Erickson told to patients and students over the years. For the last six years or so of his life he met with groups of psychotherapists almost every day, for uninterrupted four- or five-hour sessions, during which he would discuss hypnosis, therapy, and life and would generously call on “teaching tales.”




Most of the names in the stories that follow have been changed, except for those of members of the Erickson family, since I was assured that the latter had no objection to the use of their names. Throughout the book, unless gender is specified, I have referred to the patient or student as “he,” since constant use of “he or she” would be unwieldy. This is a case where our pronouns have not yet caught up with our raised consciousness.

Thanks are due to Elaine Rosenfeld, Dava Weinstein, and Joan Poelvoorde for help in obtaining material; to Ernest Rossi for support and encouragement; and to Jeffrey Zeig for generous donation of both his time and invaluable ideas. Betty Erickson deserves special thanks—for her trust that I would not vulgarize Milton’s work, for the days she spent going over the manuscript and family tales, and for insisting on accuracy, even in the smallest details. Any lapses from her standards are, of course, my responsibility.

And I want you to choose some time in the past when you were a very, very little girl. And my voice will go with you. And my voice will change into that of your parents, your neighbors, your friends, your schoolmates, your playmates, your teachers. And I want you to find yourself sitting in the school room, a little girl feeling happy about something, something that happened a long time ago, that you forgot a long time ago.



—Milton H. Erickson A man wanted to know about mind, not in nature, but in his private, large computer. He asked it (no doubt in his best Fortran), “Do you compute that you will ever think like a human being?” The machine then set to work to analyze its own computational habits. Finally, the machine printed its answer on a piece of paper, as such machines do. The man ran to get the answer and found, neatly typed, the words: THAT REMINDS ME OF A STORY.
