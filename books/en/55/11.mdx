title: Conclusion
---







Language learning has truly changed my life, and it opened up doors for me in ways I cannot even begin to describe.

Because of this, it makes me so happy to see the many regular e-mails and comments I get from around the world on my blog and videos, telling me that someone has been inspired to learn a language when they didn’t believe they could before. I feel so proud to have been a small part of their story in learning an entirely new means of communication with a different culture.

If you are curious about my travels and my story and background, or how I’m doing or where I am right now, feel free to read more about me on fi3m.com/benny.

You can also find me on my blog at Fluentin3Months.com, which has tons of articles related to language learning, and posting on Twitter (@irishpolyglot), Facebook.com/fluentin 3months, google.com/+bennylewis, youtube.com/irishpolyglot, and youtube.com/fluentinthreemonths. I really look forward to connecting with you and hearing your story and progress!

To help you go further with your language learning journey, you can find additions to this book, including interviews with many people mentioned throughout the pages, and much more in-depth explanations of the topics introduced at the chapter-specific links provided and at fi3m.com/book-plus.

If any of these words have helped you or inspired you to learn a language, please share your story with me! But most important of all, share your newfound encouragement and enthusiasm with other potential language learners so we can help bridge the gaps between cultures and remove barriers by learning one another’s languages.

Even if you didn’t learn a foreign language growing up, I hope I’ve convinced you that it’s never too late to start this exciting journey. Thanks for reading, and don’t forget to check out the many up-to-date additions to this book online. Best of luck on your language learning journey—make sure to start using your target language today!

ABOUT THE AUTHOR





BENNY LEWIS would not describe himself as a linguist—in fact, he was distinctly mediocre at languages at school. But now, ten years on, he has learned to speak over a dozen languages, has travelled the world, and has countless friends in many different countries. How? His success is due to a change in mindset and approach—a process he has shared successfully with thousands who have discovered how to start speaking from day one. Benny’s goal is to impart his insights so that everyone can see how knowing other languages can change your life.
