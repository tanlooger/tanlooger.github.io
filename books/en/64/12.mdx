title: 12 USING CONFLICT PRODUCTIVELY
---







Maddie and Adam, Parts 2, 3, and 4


Mia and Aniyah’s argument surfaced some core issues—Aniyah’s feeling unheard, Mia’s feeling censored, and both not feeling as close as they once were. When they realized the root of what was going on for them, they willingly made adjustments to their approach with each other. Their problem wasn’t simple, but it did contain an easy solution.

But many conflicts don’t have easy solutions. Let’s say you rely on your parents for childcare, which they’re happy to provide, but they are much firmer disciplinarians than you are. It upsets you, but you’re afraid if you call them on it, they’ll back away from giving the childcare that you desperately need. It seems like your needs are mutually exclusive: You want the free childcare, done with a softer hand, and they want to be firm. Also, what if they accuse you of taking advantage of their generosity? Or what if it brings up unresolved feelings about how strict they were with you when you were a kid? There’s a whole wasp’s nest of issues in danger of being disturbed.

For these types of conflicts, everyone needs to bring their A game, because it’s likely to get harder before it gets easier. That is especially the case with the contentious issues around work and childcare facing Maddie and Adam from chapter 5.





Maddie and Adam, Part 2


A few weeks after Adam and Maddie discussed their disagreements—to no satisfying end—Maddie had lunch with her friend Teresa. Teresa had finally sorted out her family’s childcare issues and had been able to go back to her full-time job. “It can be done,” she said. “It’s just not cheap.” Maddie asked how she was able to work it out with her husband. “It wasn’t easy,” Teresa said, “and it took some negotiating, including his agreeing to step up and do more housework, but we reached an agreement.”

That evening, Adam came home after Maddie had put the kids to bed. He’d called earlier to tell her he had good news, so she waited to eat so they could talk over dinner. She felt hungry, tired, and grumpy. She also kept replaying her conversation with Teresa in her head.

Adam walked in the door with a big smile and said, “I have something wonderful to tell you—can’t wait to talk about it over dinner.” As they sat down, he proudly announced that he’d been offered a new assignment, which signified a big opportunity. He’d learn a lot and be better positioned for a coveted promotion. Maddie listened but didn’t say much. Adam described the additional responsibilities the assignment required, saying that one of the costs would be “cutting more into evenings and weekends for a while, but it will be worth it.”

Maddie sighed and offered a quiet “Good for you.”

“That’s it?” Adam said.

“Well, Adam,” she said, “this just makes what we’ve been trying to talk about for months even worse. I’m already unhappy with how much more responsibility for the kids and the household I have, and now you’re telling me you’re going to be around even less. It’s hard for me to get really excited about what that means, no matter how great it is for you.”

“This again?”

 “Yes, this again!” Maddie said. “And it’s not going away.”

They stared at each other for a minute, and then she continued, “I had lunch with Teresa today and she told me about a great day care she found so that she could go back to work full-time. Maybe if we could look into that and free up more of my time, that would help, especially if you’re going to spend even more evenings and weekends away from home.”

“But we can’t afford that,” Adam said. “The cost of childcare is exorbitant. We can’t spend that kind of money right now, when the kitchen remodel substantially depleted our savings.”

“Well, then maybe you should consider turning down the assignment.”

“That doesn’t make any sense,” said Adam. “This opportunity sets us up for a lot more success in the future.”

Maddie considered picking up the dishes and silently carrying them to the kitchen but stopped herself. Instead, she said, “Adam, I can’t be excited for you because I feel resentful more than anything else. I am not going to quietly retreat this time. I’ve had it! Things have to change, and we need to talk about it. Your career decisions are costing me, personally, and they’re hurting our relationship.”

“What do you mean?”

“Look, you have everything. You have an exciting job that’s interesting, challenging, and meaningful, and all the adult interaction anyone could want. I’m stuck at home with a three- and five-year-old.”

“Isn’t that meaningful?”

“Sure, in a certain sense,” Maddie said. “But do you want to trade places? How would you feel if your whole day was spent grocery shopping, cleaning the kitchen, and playing with little children, as adorable as they are, devoid of adult conversations and intellectual challenge? Would you want that?”

“Wait just a minute,” Adam said. “Don’t make me out to be the bad guy here. We agreed to this arrangement—that I’d be the breadwinner for a while, and you’d take care of the kids and house. Two working parents just brings too much stress—we decided that together.”

 “I know, and I’m sorry,” Maddie said, “but I can’t buy into that decision anymore. When we made it, I didn’t realize the extent of the downside.”

“I don’t know what to do for you, hon. I love you.”

“I know you love me—that’s not the point. The point is that I’m starting to think we show love differently. Look, I want to support you and cheer for your work successes. I am and want to stay committed to your development. And I need you to be just as committed to mine. I’m not feeling that; I worry that you’ll be happy if I just take care of the kids and the house. That’s not contributing to my happiness and growth. And I spend a lot of time feeling unhappy.”

“So you want me to give up this new assignment?”

“No, of course not. I want to support you and give you the full appreciation you deserve, but I need you to support me too.”

“I guess I don’t know how to do that. You usually just walk away when we get into this. It leaves me feeling kind of helpless.”

“Really? That surprises me,” said Maddie. “It never occurred to me that you felt helpless. I thought you didn’t care about my feelings or just wanted to be right.”

“Well, you’re right that I cared about being right.” He smiled sheepishly. “But I also really care about you. You’re my wife and life partner.”

“And you’re right that I have been walking away from these conversations, but not because there was nothing you could do. I walked away because I was afraid of the conflict and scared about what it meant for us. I guess now I’m more afraid of what will happen if I just keep walking away.”

“What are you afraid of?” Adam asked softly.

“When we first got married, we had an equal relationship. We made key decisions together, and we helped each other grow. I’m afraid we’ve lost that. I fear you’ll brush me off or respond with something that will leave me feeling worse, like reminding me of the rewards of motherhood or how the kids will grow up feeling so close to me. I’m also realizing that by my not saying much about my growing resentment, I’m at fault, too. As hard as this feels right now, I think the first step in addressing what’s going on between us is for me to stop running away.”





How Maddie Regained Her Power


When two people avoid dealing with important issues, as Maddie and Adam did, they often get stuck and can’t move into productive problem-solving. Maddie faced two issues with Adam: The first was their differences regarding childcare, but the second, which blocked them from dealing with the first, was the power imbalance that caused Maddie to believe she couldn’t influence him.

Maddie began to narrow the power discrepancy by first ceasing to be controlled by her fear of the conflict that might result if she expressed her feelings and concerns more strongly. She questioned the legitimacy of the socially defined gender roles that her mother praised, and she questioned the previous agreement she and Adam had made on the grounds that she hadn’t understood the full consequences. She took a stand and didn’t run away as she had in the past. Maddie also used all four of the variations on the basic feedback model:

This is how your behavior is affecting me. She talked about her feelings of unhappiness and resentment.

Your behavior is not meeting your goals. She talked about not being as supportive and excited about Adam’s possible new assignment as he would have liked.

Your behavior may be meeting your goals, but it is costly to you. She acknowledged that he was meeting his goal of occupational advancement but at great cost to their relationship and to their joint goal of an equitable, fair marriage.

Am I doing anything that is causing that behavior? She owned her part of the problem in her past behavior of running away and avoiding conflict.



The conversation would have unfolded very differently if Maddie had been over-the-net accusatory. Imagine if she’d said: “I feel that you only care about yourself.” “I feel that you put your success before my happiness and our marriage.” “You just want to use me to bear your children and clean your house.” “You are just a typical self-centered, exploitative man.” Adam would be unlikely to own any of these accusations, and they’d make him defensive. Accusations may make the giver feel good by releasing pent-up anger, but they drive the other away.

As we have stressed, a major source of power comes from being aware of your emotions. Maddie’s resentment over Adam’s new opportunity helped her realize just how bad the situation between them had become. Awareness of your feelings allows you to make more informed choices. If she had once again reasoned herself out of her feelings (I should be happy taking care of the kids—they’ll only be this age once—and it makes sense, for the whole family, for Adam to maximize his earning potential now, so I should just be happy for him), she wouldn’t have raised what were really important issues in their marriage or gotten Adam’s full attention.

The objective at this point is not to get Adam to accept her solution of paying for day care. That would be premature. Instead, it’s to get him to the table to seriously discuss the issues. After all, Maddie had only her point of view and needed Adam’s to engage in joint problem-solving. But they had more work to do first.

In order to surface the problems in their marriage, each had to be willing to hang in there even if doing so initially resulted in more conflict. Intense disagreements produce strong emotions, which can make it difficult to hear the other person’s concerns and lead to more deeply entrenched positions and greater risk of escalation. However, as we saw with Mia and Aniyah, the same intensity of emotion can also signal the importance of an issue, leading to more willingness to roll up your sleeves and get to work.

 Maddie and Adam have made progress, but they aren’t yet at the point where they can problem-solve. That doesn’t mean they’re in deep trouble. The issues are out on the table, and Maddie is clearly not retreating.





Maddie and Adam, Part 3


Adam took everything in. “This is hard to hear,” he said, “but I’m glad we are talking about it.”

Maddie’s body relaxed. “Thanks, that really helps.”

They sat in silence for a minute, appreciating where they were. Then she added, “We need to go back to making the most important decisions in our life together and redefine how to support each other.”

“Yup,” said Adam. “So…how?”

“I suggested something that I think would really help—some additional childcare. But you immediately shot that down as too expensive.”

“Well it is!”

“Wait a minute! Yes, it’s expensive, but who are you to say it’s too expensive? Are you the ultimate authority of what is too expensive?”

“I’m the one who agonizes over the finances every month,” said Adam. “I don’t see you doing that.”

“That just makes me angry,” Maddie said, her voice rising. “This is usually the point where I walk away from our conversations, but I’m not going to do that again. Adam, I’m speechless. How can you imply I don’t care about how much money we spend? You know damn well that I’m frugal. I’m the one who went searching for cheaper options on the kitchen remodel. I really feel hurt by that comment!”

 “I’m sorry,” Adam said defensively, “but I worry about money a lot.”

“For goodness’ sake, don’t you think that I do, too? All I’m asking for is some childcare so that I can do something beyond taking care of the kids and the household day in and day out.”

Adam crossed his arms. “Well, putting them in day care isn’t the answer. You know what all our friends say—kids in day care get sick all the time. You’d have to miss work anyway to pick them up, only we’d still be paying for someone else to take care of them, and we’d both be stressed. It just makes no sense. What else do you have in mind?”

“I don’t like what’s happening, again! I bring up ideas, and you veto them. If you don’t like my suggestion, then you come up with a solution. Kids and family are both of our responsibilities. These are your kids, too. This is our problem, not just my problem.”

Adam didn’t respond.

Maddie asked, “What are you thinking?”

“Nothing.”

“How could you be thinking nothing? You must be thinking something.”

“Well, I suppose if this is really important to you, then you’ll have to earn enough to cover childcare after taxes.”

“Wait a minute, Adam. That hardly feels like a fair solution. What happens if I can’t initially cover it all? This makes childcare sound as though it is my sole responsibility, not ours. And it is ours. What happened to that part of you that was once concerned about me? You’re making this sound like what I’m asking for is some sort of luxury.”

Adam took this in and finally said, “This just upsets all that we’d agreed to. It throws everything up in the air, and I don’t know what to do.”

 “What I’m asking you to do is think of options and not just immediately reject mine. What do you think we should do?”

Once again Adam was quiet. Then he said, “I don’t want to have this conversation anymore.”

“It’s not like I’m loving this. But I’m pretty sure nothing is going to get better if you refuse to talk about it, and I care too much about us to let it go.”

“We’ve talked it to death and we’re not getting anywhere.” His arms remained crossed. He looked down and said nothing more.

“I don’t think it’s going to do any good to run away from it,” Maddie said. “Let’s both try to hang in there until we get somewhere. We’ve stopped short of resolving this too many times before and I’m afraid of what will happen if we do that again.”

They sat in silence across the table from each other, neither quite knowing what to say next.





Why Conflict Is So Scary


At first blush, it looked like Maddie and Adam’s encounter was going downhill. This is what many fear about conflict—heated emotional back-and-forth arguments, accusations, escalation, and further entrenched positions. There is no question that conflict is uncomfortable and messy at best, and sometimes even frightening. At the height of an interpersonal conflict, we fear irreparable damage or the end of the relationship. But ending the conversation at this point only increases the likelihood that what we fear most will occur: permanent deadlock. Furthermore, it results in little to no learning.

Even though it’s easy for one or both parties to take things very personally, this kind of escalation need not get out of hand. Look at what happened when Adam suggested Maddie was flip about money: Maddie could have tried to suppress her feelings (as she had done in the past) or gone to the other extreme and blown up with retaliatory attacks. Instead, she raised her voice and reported feeling angry. She was clear. Her words and tone were congruent with the situation. It worked, though it’s worth noting that no one alternative is always the “right” way. In spite of her anger at Adam’s accusation that she was not as concerned about their expenses, she responded with the facts: “You know damn well that I’m frugal. I’m the one who went searching for cheaper options on the kitchen remodel.” She then shared her feelings rather than attacking Adam. (“I really feel hurt by that comment!”) In all of these statements, she demonstrated the importance of sticking with her feelings and the facts regarding what she did and said.

 When Maddie responded to Adam by saying she was angry and hurt, as opposed to, say, labeling Adam a tightwad, she stayed on her side of the net. This choice was more likely to avoid escalation and move the conversation toward problem-solving.

At one point, Adam started to stonewall Maddie when he said, “We’ve talked it to death and we’re not getting anywhere,” crossed his arms, looked down, and went silent. As psychologist John Gottman notes in his research, stonewalling is infuriating. Adam’s initial move toward stonewalling was blocked when Maddie said, “I don’t think it’s going to do any good to run away from it. Let’s both try to hang in there until we get somewhere.” Note that while Maddie didn’t back down, she also didn’t push by saying something like, “Damn it, I’m not going to let you just go silent,” which would have made Adam feel cornered. Instead, she reiterated her intent, indicating how much she cared about the relationship. She stayed at a similar emotional level as Adam and remained factual.





Maddie and Adam, Part 4


After a protracted period, Maddie broke the silence and asked, in a genuinely curious way, “What is it about this whole money-and-childcare thing that’s so difficult for you?”

Adam was quiet a little longer, struggling with where to begin. “I guess I think a lot about Reed,” he said, referencing his best friend from college. “After we graduated, he took a better-paying job than I did. But money just burned a hole in his pocket. He always had to have the newest and fanciest cars, and he went deeply into debt to buy a large house when we were still renting. His wife also liked to spend money, and they went on fancy vacations—remember how they were always going to Fiji and Singapore? It’s why we never joined them. But then he went bankrupt, and not only did he lose everything, but their marriage broke up, too. That has so stayed with me—and scared me—that I don’t want anything like that to happen to us.”

 Maddie felt tears welling up. “I knew about their divorce, but I don’t think I ever knew the whole story or the impact it had on you. This is clearly important stuff for you, Adam, and I so appreciate that you shared it. I think understanding this piece of the puzzle may help us get somewhere. I can understand your concern with money, and I support that. But we are nothing like Reed, and childcare won’t bankrupt us. As much as I want to support you, I also need you to support me.”

Adam nodded, and they both lapsed back into reflective silence but maintained eye contact this time.

Maddie broke the silence again. “You know I wouldn’t be having this conversation with you, as tired as I am, if I didn’t love you. I am still committed to you and to our marriage.”

“Me too. I’ve been so nose-to-the-grindstone that I haven’t picked up on what was going on. You sounded angrier and more resentful before. But what I’m hearing this time is your disappointment, sadness, and fear.”

“We’re both exhausted,” Maddie said, “and maybe it’s better if we sleep on it, as long as we both agree to come back to the subject tomorrow. Since it’s Saturday, maybe it will be easier to carve out time. My mom already has plans to take the kids to the zoo for the day.”

“Yeah, that’s probably a good idea.”



* * *



—

 It’s fortunate that Maddie responded to Adam’s stonewalling with empathy and curiosity (“What is it about this whole money-and-childcare thing that’s so difficult for you?”) instead of pushing harder. She broadened the scope of the conversation without running away from the original issue. She invited Adam to share more and gave him plenty of space to do so. Adam and Maddie’s conversations highlight how the problem-solving stages we described earlier in the book are neither linear nor distinct. Particularly when a problem is complex or thorny, it’s important to take steps toward repairing the relationship even while issues remain unresolved. Maddie’s curiosity was authentic in conveying her care and worry. She was able to be direct about her needs and concerns while still connecting with Adam, all of which made it easier to get the issues on the table and begin that process of repair.

The earlier repair attempts begin, the more productive the likely outcome. Had Maddie escalated with contempt or walked away during this conversation, or had Adam closed down, there would have been much more damage to the relationship. Instead, they continued to engage with each other until they both felt at least somewhat heard, emotionally met, and able to express their commitment.

It was also important that they took a break. When you’re exhausted or so emotionally flooded that you can’t take in much more, a temporary hiatus makes sense. There’s an important distinction, though, between refusal to deal with a situation and taking some time and space to let thoughts and feelings settle. Such self-reflection is almost impossible when you are highly emotionally triggered. Critically, Adam and Maddie set a specific time to come back to the issue. This kept them from avoiding the problem until the next time it reared its head, when it likely would have had even more anger attached.

An adage from the 1960s personal growth movement was “Never let the sun set on a dispute.” We strongly disagree. A break can provide needed perspective, whereas the desire to “get this over with” can lead to hasty agreements that don’t feel good after we’ve slept on them.

 Also useful was their taking shorter breaks during the discussion. A problem with conflict is that the back-and-forth can be so rapid that there isn’t time to consider whether other approaches might work. Even though the silence between Maddie and Adam might have initially felt like an impasse, it was only after they were quiet that Maddie was able to move from argument to curiosity. Short breaks don’t have to be a form of avoidance. They can be opportunities to assess feelings and whether those emotions are clues to deeper issues.

The times when the couple sat in silence could easily have felt frustrating and led them to want to do something. But there’s a saying for this that we do like: “Don’t just do something; sit there.” In the Interpersonal Dynamics course, we say, “Trust the process.” That means, “At this moment, I may not know what’s really going on or what the solution is, but if we can hang in there in expressing our feelings, then it will become clearer and eventually work out.” That’s the stance Maddie took when she said, “Nothing is going to get better if you refuse to talk about it,” and “Let’s both try to hang in there until we get somewhere.”

In this process, Maddie and Adam began to redefine the rules of the game:

No running away—we are sticking with this until we resolve it.



Both of us have a responsibility to come up with possible solutions.



Costs have to be incurred and accepted by both of us.





Even though they made these agreements, Adam and Maddie had not yet fully moved into problem-solving territory. They progressed from trying to prove each other wrong to beginning to understand what was important to each of them and the other. They began to see that the issues were about more than just childcare. Though there was still much ground to cover, they turned a significant corner toward resolution. They are not yet at exceptional, but they have laid the groundwork for getting there.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Maddie’s shoes. She is in a difficult spot given her strong needs to both rectify what is going on and not damage her marriage. In reviewing what she said and tried to do, how would you have handled those situations? Which ones might have been especially challenging for you?



Effective Approaches: After Maddie got over her fear of conflict, she was able to use it productively. She:

 hung in there and didn’t back down



didn’t escalate by name-calling



owned her part in the problem and didn’t put all the fault on Adam



used the feedback model and its variations without making accusations



was in touch with her emotions and used them effectively



didn’t get defensive when Adam made a negative attribution about her approach to their finances and instead used facts to rebut



broadened the scope of solutions they considered



made sure both stayed with the topic and didn’t run away



was able to be curious and inquire about what was going on with Adam



agreed with his goals and was explicit about disagreeing on ways to accomplish them





When you are in conflict situations around important issues and have strong feelings, how many of these approaches do you tend to use? Which ones are easier? Which are more challenging?



Key Relationship: Does one of the people in your key relationships use conflict well? What specifically do they do? Conversely, is there someone with whom conflict is problematic? What do they do?





APPLICATION


If you identified a person who handles conflict well, ask them how they are able to do that when upset or attacked.

If you have a relationship with someone in which conflict resolution is problematic, discuss how to improve that.





MAKING SENSE


What did you learn about conflict management and about your strengths and limitations? What steps are you going to take for your further development?

If you had a discussion with someone with whom conflict resolution is problematic, how did that discussion affect your relationship? What did you learn about raising a potentially difficult situation that you are going to use in other discussions and with other people?





IN THE MEADOW


You and your companion have just made it over the headwall. It’s been a good climb, but it’s taken a lot of energy, and you decide to sit down in a welcoming meadow for a rest. The summit of the mountain looms ahead, but the view around you is quite lovely, the grass soft.

Now, in the meadow, you have more choices. Stay where you are and appreciate what you’ve achieved? Hike along the meadow, skirting the side of the mountain and stopping at one of the warming huts? Go on to the top? Dark clouds are forming on the summit of Mount Washington, but you have climbed through them before and like the challenge. The view up there is spectacular once the clouds have cleared, and you also feel equipped to handle any bad weather.

But you don’t have to make those decisions yet….



In the previous chapters, you acquired an invaluable set of competencies—especially if you have used the Deepen Your Learning suggestions and applied the material. You have learned how to build good relationships and then develop them into ones that are strong, robust, and mutually rewarding. You have learned that you can make it from an easy path to the most challenging climbs. (If you’re interested in reviewing the competencies from part I, they can be found in appendix B on this page.)

These competencies are relevant for all relationships, be they with casual acquaintances or much closer friends. They’re applicable not only with family and friends but also at work with colleagues, direct reports, and even your boss. It is not accidental that the Interpersonal Dynamics course has been taught at Stanford and other leading business schools for more than five decades. People do business with people, so getting these competencies right at work is a key determinant of professional success.

Even if you read no further, you will have gained a great deal. In these final chapters, though, we will see how the five featured relationships of the book move along the continuum toward exceptional. Some make it, and some don’t. The people in each relationship face a crucial dilemma and using (or not using) these competencies impacts their ability to transition their relationship from strong and functional to exceptional, something so deep that it feels almost magical.

All five relationships have developed significantly. The players have grown to know each other better, established some norms that legitimize raising issues, learned how to express their needs with minimal blame, and, to varying degrees, worked on effective problem-solving. What will it now take to transition to exceptional, and how will they know if they’ve achieved it? How does anyone?

There is no one precise point at which this happens, and to some extent it’s in the eye of the beholder. But you’ll know you’ve reached exceptional when you don’t have to hold back significant parts of yourself that are relevant to the relationship—nor does the other person. It’s when you can easily say that you’re feeling uncertain or confused about what is going on with the other person and with you, so that you can talk about it. It’s when you can deal with major issues, even though it feels scary.

Even then, exceptional isn’t an end state but rather has its own continuum. Each person can always disclose more, support and challenge more, and move into new areas of growth. You come to understand the nuances of the deepening connection, and your “antennae” become even more finely tuned.

Many times, relationships transition to exceptional organically, in an iterative, ever-deepening cycle. These may be long-term family, friend, or work connections in which differences and disagreements are resolved and don’t get in the way of increasing closeness. There are no big, difficult conflicts or thorny issues. Neither person minces words when one of them feels a pinch, and more important, they both know how to resolve those while they are relatively small. Each is committed to the other’s learning and unafraid to shine a light on whatever they think will benefit the other. Truth telling and loving confrontation are norms established early and upheld throughout the relationship. An accumulation of quantitative steps becomes an unquestionable qualitative shift over time.

In other cases, relationships become exceptional as a result of critical choice points, as we’ll see in the next three chapters. In chapter 13, we return to Maddie and Adam to examine what it takes to resolve contentious issues. Chapter 14 describes a crucible moment for Elena and Sanjay during which setting boundaries strengthens rather than hurts their relationship. And in chapter 15, we explore Mia and Aniyah’s dilemma of how to handle a situation in which one person desperately needs something important that triggers a painful issue for the other.

Not all deep relationships make it to exceptional. In chapter 16, we look at various examples where that is the case and explore why. We also examine the tricky issue of exceptional relationships at work. The bottom line: They’re possible but require some extra considerations.

Finally, relationship development is not a straight line. In the final chapter, we will look at what happened between the two of us that temporarily destroyed our exceptional relationship. We focus on how we went awry, how we recovered, and how it helped us grow even closer.

So, while not all exceptional relationships are born of a crisis, that is the focus of four of the final five chapters, because shying away from crises out of fear is often what stops us from getting to exceptional. To return to our mountain-climbing analogy, let’s assume this is the first time that you and your companion have made this climb. Even though the two of you want to reach the summit, the top is shrouded in dark clouds and the wind is picking up. It would be easy to just stay in the meadow and not make the final extra effort. Moving to exceptional can, with many relationships, be just a steady climb, but some relationships require facing major challenges. We hope these final chapters will encourage you to take them on.
