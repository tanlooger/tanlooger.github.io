Maddie and Adam, Parts 5 and 6


When two people sit down and collaboratively solve problems, the solution is usually far superior to what either could have come up with alone. They will consider a wider range of options, catch flaws in each other’s thinking, and benefit from each other’s style. One might be more comfortable with risk while the other might be more cautious. Or one might focus on successes achieved, whereas the other might see problems still to be dealt with. Each needs the other for balance, but the balance only works if they each learn how to use their tendencies productively.





Maddie and Adam, Part 5


The morning after Adam and Maddie surfaced their issues, Maddie’s mom collected the kids for an outing, and Adam and Maddie sat down at the kitchen table together over coffee.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about our conversation last night,” Adam said. “And I want you to know I heard you. You’re right that I’ve been pretty focused on my career and what I want, and not as focused on what’s going on with you. I’m sorry for that.”

Maddie’s eyes welled up. “Thank you for saying that.”

 “Okay, so let’s recap where we are,” said Adam, and he went through the issues he understood to be on Maddie’s mind. She did the same for him. “So what do we do now?” Adam said.

“I was thinking about it while falling asleep, and I have a couple of ideas,” Maddie said. “The Winnikers have Janie’s mother live with them, but even though you get along with my mom, I’m not sure either of us want that.” Adam nodded in agreement. “We could look into an au pair, but our house isn’t really that large and we like our privacy.”

“I thought of that, too, but rejected it for the same reason.”

Maddie continued, “A third option is to take a really close look at the monthly expenses together and see how much money we might be able to spare toward some childcare. With that in mind, I could then start exploring some of my options for perhaps a part-time job or more volunteering.”

“But all the money we have to spare goes toward our savings cushion. I’d feel more comfortable if we keep that safety reserve.”

“I would, too, but we can’t have everything. You said that this new assignment comes with a pay raise and puts you in a better position for a promotion that would also come with another raise. Aren’t both of us investing in the present for payoffs in the future?”

Adam thought it over. “Okay,” he said at last. “I see your point.”

“But?” said Maddie. “I know you too well. What are you worried about?”

Adam laughed. “Yeah, you do know me too well. But I’m not sure I can answer that. Logically, I agree with the investing-in-the-future approach, but it’s still unsettling for me. I don’t fully know why.” After a little reflection, he said, “I think one of the things that’s bothering me so much is that I thought we’d made an agreement after Derek was born that you would stay home with the kids. And now you want to break it.”

“Really?” Maddie asked. She felt defensive but resisted escalating the discussion. “It hadn’t even occurred to me that this was part of the problem. Yes, we made an agreement, and I hear that my wanting to change it is really upsetting. But things change all the time. What is it about this change that’s so hard?”

 “I know that things change, but that’s the issue. There are so many damn moving parts, I want some things to be stable, like us and our agreements. I have a really hard time having set my expectations that life was going to unfold in one way and having it go another.”

“But wait a minute,” Maddie interjected. “There’s a lot that’s stable in our life—like our marriage and our commitment to the kids. Also, if you talk about holding to agreements, what about our agreement to be concerned with both of us growing—you were willing to let that slide. What’s so important about this other agreement?”

Adam thought about it for a minute. “I know, and I totally agree with you logically. I think there’s something about our agreement that one of us would stay home that meant a lot to me. I’m probably too traditional or overthinking it, but we’ve seen so many families around us who are completely stressed out when both parents work. I just want more breathing room in our life, you know? And I don’t want to outsource the hard work of parenting too much—it’s important to me that one of us does it. I’m embarrassed—it feels sexist to say this, because I’m not willing to give up my job. I am committed to your growth and happiness. And I can’t justify my feelings, but they’re there.”

Maddie relaxed. “Thanks for sharing that. I sort of had a hunch that was the case, but it makes a big difference to hear you acknowledge it. Look, honey, I will still be there for the kids, even with part-time childcare. And I get how important the issue of committing to a decision is to you, so we need to be careful when we make final decisions to separate that from ‘working agreements.’ But it sounds like, for now, the idea of more childcare is the best alternative. Can you live with exploring that?”

Adam nodded in agreement. “Okay. Just having this out there makes me feel better. Let’s give it a shot.”

 Maddie smiled in appreciation. “Thanks. But there’s a lot we need to know before we make a decision. I need to explore the feasibility of part-time work and check out childcare options. Let’s go over our budget together and see if there are areas we can cut. Okay?”

Adam nodded slowly in agreement. “Whatever we try, let’s see it as a trial for a certain period and see how it works out.”

Maddie and Adam did a good job in their first pass at problem-solving, avoiding some really common traps:

Rushing to judgment: Conflict is stressful, and the desire to move quickly past it can lead to premature acceptance of the first option suggested. Complex problems usually have more than one viable solution and often involve issues that each person feels strongly about. Fortunately, Maddie and Adam did not fall into the rush-to-judgment trap. They ensured the discussion was aimed at solving the problem in a way that satisfied both of them.



Either/or thinking: An extreme case of this would have been: “We either need to pay for full-time day care or it’s the status quo.” They avoided this when Maddie initially suggested several alternatives. Maddie did most of the heavy lifting here—if they had engaged in a joint brainstorming session, it’s possible they would have generated even more options, such as seeing if Maddie’s mother might cover for them a couple days a week.



Arguing about solutions rather than focusing on needs: This trap happens when people prematurely focus attention on the upsides and downsides of the solutions rather than stepping back and identifying the core problem. Paying for day care is a solution—but not necessarily the only solution—to Maddie’s more basic need for intellectual challenge and adult interaction.



Treating opinions as facts: Adam fell into this trap, believing that there wasn’t a budget for childcare even though he hadn’t taken a close look at their finances. Similarly, when he shared his new career opportunity, he explained it would come with more evenings and weekends at work, but how true was that? Had he checked that out with his manager, or was he making an assumption?



Confusing “trials” with final decisions: What feels right now may not later, as Maddie discovered when she found herself dissatisfied with their previous agreement. A trial agreement is a decision to take action that allows for more data collection. Testing how well the trial decision is working allows modifications before making a final decision.



Undervaluing personal needs: Facts and logic are important; they point to what is possible. But as we have already stressed, balancing each person’s needs is equally important. Adam did a good job acknowledging that some of his feelings of uncertainty weren’t logical, but they were there nonetheless. If he hadn’t done this, any resolution would have been incomplete and likely unsustainable.



Not taking account of personal styles: Everyone has habits, needs, and proclivities. Adam appears to be somewhat rigid regarding agreements, and Maddie took that into account in articulating the difference between a trial decision and a final one.



Deciding who implements what: As there are options (and preferences) in what the decision is, there are also options (and preferences) in how it is carried out. Adam shouldn’t tell Maddie how she should go about researching job options, and she shouldn’t tell him how to raise issues of work/life balance with his manager. They can jointly agree with what has to be done without getting into how.





Maddie and Adam, Part 6


The following Wednesday evening, Adam and Maddie sat on the couch for a glass of wine after putting the kids to bed.

“I have to admit something,” Adam said. “Even though I agreed with what we talked about on Saturday, I still had some qualms.”

Maddie looked worried. “You don’t want to open up the whole issue again, do you?”

“Don’t worry,” Adam laughed, “and I think you’re going to want to hear this. I needed to talk about all of this with someone else, so Drew and I had lunch today.”

“WHAT? You shared our personal problems with somebody else!”

“Wait a minute,” Adam said. “It’s all right. You know that Drew and I are close—it’s not like I’m telling just anyone. Drew’s talked to me about problems he has with his son, and I needed to talk about our decision out loud. I was going around in circles in my own head. And don’t worry—I didn’t paint you as the bad guy. In fact, he took your side and was very direct with me.” Adam laughed. “Some friend!”

“What did he say?”

“Pretty much what you said. In fact, he sort of chewed me out, saying that I was only thinking about myself and not thinking enough about you. He even went so far as to say that I didn’t deserve you,” Adam said lightly. “It really made me think.”

“Well, because you’re willing to look at this,” Maddie said with a smile, “you very much deserve me!”

“It’s not that I didn’t listen to you the other day. It was just reassuring to hear another perspective. And the way that he talked about working out his issues with his wife, it didn’t make me feel so alone.”

Maddie nodded. “I’ve never thought we have to appear as the perfect couple to the world.” After they sat in silence for a bit, she said, “I’ve been doing some thinking of my own about why it’s so important for me to work. I want adult interaction and a chance to continually grow, which we’ve talked about, but there’s something else. Do you remember that my mom dropped out of college when she got married? She had to work to support my dad through engineering school. Not having a degree meant that all she could get was clerical work—not very fulfilling. And she quit even that when my brothers and I came along. She never had a career, and I know she has regrets.” Maddie started crying. “And I’m scared of ending up like her.”

 Adam set down his wine and put his arms around her.

After Maddie regained some control, she continued, “And as I say this, I realize there’s something more. Dad loved Mom, but I’m not sure that he really respected her for the whole person she was. Sure, he respected her raising us and keeping a good house, but that isn’t the same. I think I’m worried that this may also happen to us.”

Adam took it in and was quiet for a minute. “I hate to admit it,” he said, finally, “but I see why you’re concerned about this. I’m so appreciative of what you do for the kids, but…yeah, it might limit what I talk to you about. I don’t know if that’s the same issue as respect, but I can see where you’re coming from.” He paused again while both of them processed, then continued, “Okay, I get why this issue is so important—for both of us.”

The following weekend, Adam and Maddie pored over the numbers and settled on a budget for childcare, freeing up some of her time. “That should be enough for me to get a part-time job for now,” she said, “but I don’t want to be locked into this. Let’s see how it goes—I may want more or less.” After a little more back-and-forth, they agreed to a six-month trial.

“Just to be clear—this is an experiment for both of us, right?” Adam asked.

Maddie nodded. “Absolutely. Thank you for agreeing to try it.”

 During the course of the couple’s conversations, the framing of the discussion changed. It was no longer “Maddie’s problem” but a joint issue the couple needed to solve together. They were both then ready to explore different solutions, which included generating some options and coming up with a joint decision-making process. They succeeded in reaching a tentative solution to the day care problem.

When either or both parties are resistant to giving up on some topic, deep historical issues are often at play. It is important that the conversation be given the time and space for these to surface and be explored. Awareness of ways in which someone is influenced by their past can prevent labeling them prematurely. This was true for both Adam and Maddie. It would have been easy for Maddie to conclude that her husband was a tightwad, but she stepped back, moved into inquiry, and asked, “What is it about this whole money-and-childcare thing that’s so difficult for you?”

Asking the question was itself important, but so was Adam’s willingness to be self-reflective in his answer. Without having built a climate of support and commitment for each other, they may never have gotten there. What Adam shared about his friend from college wasn’t easy, because it could have been logically dismissed. (“Oh, Adam. That’s Reed—we would never do anything like that!”) Instead, Adam’s willingness to be vulnerable and disclose these historical forces made it easier for Maddie to do so later on. Her vocalization about her fears, based on her own upbringing, contributed to their conversation, and to their closeness.

As you put the puzzle pieces of problem-solving in place, paying attention to different time frames—present, past, and future—as Maddie and Adam did, is important. The present identifies sources of dissatisfaction and unmet needs (for example, her need for intellectual stimulation and his concerns over money). The past illustrates what’s been lost and informs how you’ve gotten to where you are. The future keeps you focused on where each of you wants to end up and can break the logjam of mutual recriminations. Often the discussion has to shuttle back and forth among these different time periods in order to get the best outcome.





The Role of the Third Party


People turn to others for help for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, you want to find out how others deal with a similar situation, which is what Maddie did when she asked her friend Teresa how she handled childcare. Sometimes you’re looking for a more dispassionate view, which is what Adam needed. After all, Maddie had strong feelings about what she wanted, but Drew didn’t have a personal investment in the outcome. Adam thought that Drew could provide a more objective perspective, and perhaps offer new ways of viewing the issue.

But that assumes Drew can be impartial and that he knows both parties. He is Adam’s friend, and even though he knows Maddie, he knows Adam much better. It also assumes Drew has all the relevant information. As objective as Adam might want to be, he probably wouldn’t tell the story in the same way Maddie would. The extent to which Drew could be helpful depended on his recognition of these limitations.

Those factors didn’t seem to constrain Drew’s ability to be supportive of Adam and Maddie’s shared goals, and his perspective was clarifying. Drew was quite blunt with Adam, but it could have been just as helpful if he had simply let Adam vent or asked open-ended questions to help broaden Adam’s view of the situation. We don’t advise using a third party to come up with solutions, because they don’t have all the relevant information. But they can be very useful thought partners, helping you get clearer about what you most need so that you can then productively work the issue out with the other person.





Multiple Outcomes


Adam and Maddie’s conflict was tough on both of them. So was it worth it? At the end of the day, they

reached a working solution to the immediate issue at hand



emerged with an increased ability to raise and resolve future problems



strengthened their relationship



have increased knowledge of each other





As a result of this difficult process, Adam and Maddie understand each other at a deeper level. Their efforts moved them farther on the continuum and firmly into the realm of an exceptional relationship. But perhaps the greatest progress they made was in the second bullet point: their joint ability to deal with other contentious issues in the future. In the process of dealing with the issues of money and childcare, they increased the likelihood that they would raise and resolve future challenges more productively. Maddie agreed not to avoid problems or be shut down by previous agreements that no longer worked for her. Adam agreed to take account of Maddie’s needs and not respond solely on the basis of his. Furthermore, he moved beyond the idea that children and home were just Maddie’s problems and recognized that he needed to share them as well. Most important, they identified what had previously blocked them.

Agreements like these are important first steps, but they need to be reinforced. One or the other might screw up and neglect to honor their agreement. But more worrisome than the screwup itself is what happens if it isn’t acknowledged and addressed. In fact, sometimes a violation—when corrected—actually cements the lesson for both parties and solidifies the recovery. Let’s imagine that in the future Adam raises a difficult subject and Maddie starts to avoid it. It would be very helpful if he then said, “We agreed you wouldn’t walk away to do the dishes when we’re having a hard discussion; what’s happening?”

 The more complicated a situation (and relationship), the more issues are likely to arise in the process of problem-solving. It’s like the proverbial peeling of the onion. The outer skin makes it hard to find out what’s going on. Then we discover the presenting issue, and beneath that, the even more personal, vulnerable issues. That might include the impact of significant past experiences. Each person needs to hang in there long enough to find out what’s really going on.

All of this was by no means easy. Rome was not built in a day, and the greater the conflict, the longer it’s likely to take to resolve. Resolution requires patience, skill, and commitment to both surfacing issues and collaborating to find solutions.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Maddie’s situation. There were several times when she and Adam could have given up or gone off course, but she persisted until they were able to reach a working solution. At each choice point, what do you think you would have done? Would any of the actions Maddie took be difficult for you? Any places where you might have trapped yourself?



Key Relationship: It is likely there have been one or more incidents with at least one of your key relationships when it has been difficult to problem-solve. Which of these traps do you and the other person tend to fall into?

 Either/or thinking



Arguing solutions rather than focusing on needs



Treating opinions as if they were facts



Confusing trials with final decisions



Undervaluing personal needs



Not taking account of personal styles



Deciding who implements what





Third Party: Have you encountered any of the following problems when you have been a third party or gone to one? The third party

 is unclear about the objective of their role (just listen, broaden perspective, identify untested assumptions, commiserate, etc.)



thinks they are the person who should come up with solutions



forgets that they lack crucial information (perspective from the person who isn’t there)



is drawn into taking sides





APPLICATION


If you identified an issue to discuss in one of your key relationships, it’s time to use all the skills you have learned to improve your decision-making/problem-solving process.





MAKING SENSE


How did this discussion go? Was the outcome successful in achieving the four objectives of solving the issue, improving problem-solving skills for both of you, getting to know each other better, and further strengthening the relationship?

What do you need to work on, in terms of both improving your competencies and further moving this relationship along the continuum?
