title: 14 BOUNDARIES AND EXPECTATIONS

Elena and Sanjay, Parts 5 and 6


A colleague asks if you can drop her off at the airport after work, and you readily agree. It’s only slightly out of your way, and the request seems appropriate. But another friend who’s strapped for money and doesn’t have a car frequently asks you to pick him up at the airport, no matter how late or early in the day. That, too, might feel reasonable because of the importance of the relationship—and then again it might not. If not, how do we determine our boundaries between what feels fair and what feels burdensome? And furthermore, when it is an imposition, how honest can we be? Should we just go along and say nothing for the sake of the friendship?

Everyone carries expectations of what’s okay to ask at different stages of a relationship. Your expectations may derive from past experiences or from what you think you would do for the other person. Friends rarely discuss such expectations explicitly but still hold them deeply as “the way people ought to be.” The difficulty arises when you have different expectations of what even very close friends should ask for—and do—for each other.

There may come a point when you need to draw a line in the sand, even knowing that it could damage an important relationship. What if the other person feels rejected or distanced? Avoiding the conflict by just going along is oh so tempting. But as the ancient Greek philosopher Plutarch is widely attributed as having quipped, “I don’t need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod; my shadow does that much better.” In more contemporary terms, we say that a true friend doesn’t tell you what you want to hear—they tell you what they believe is best for you. But what if that hurts the relationship? That’s the dilemma that Elena faces with Sanjay.





Elena and Sanjay, Part 5


Sanjay and Elena’s friendship continued to deepen over the next couple of years. Elena performed well and accepted a higher position in another area of the company. Even though she no longer worked directly with Sanjay, they met regularly for lunch, sharing the ease and comfort of a growing friendship, solidly anchored in knowing and caring for each other. They also broadened the circle to include Sanjay’s wife, Priya, and Elena’s husband, Eric. The four of them socialized often and became good friends. One day, Sanjay phoned Elena and asked, somewhat cryptically, if they could meet for a drink after work, saying, “There’s something business-related that I need to discuss, but not here.” She agreed, and they decided to meet at a quiet bar on the other side of town.

Sanjay picked a secluded table away from others. After they’d ordered drinks, Elena said, “So spill. What’s going on?”

“Well, first of all, thanks for taking the time. I need a sounding board and don’t have anyone else to talk to about this.”

“Of course! Sounds important.”

“Yeah, it is.” Sanjay took a breath, then let the words pour out. “I’m thinking of leaving the company to start my own. Roland, a buddy of mine from college, approached me about joining him as a co-founder. I’ve always wanted to do this, but it’s never been the right time. It may never feel like the right time, though. I’ve had this dream of doing my own thing ever since I graduated from college and got my first job. Then came marriage and kids and a mortgage and higher-and-higher-paying jobs. You know the story—golden handcuffs and all that. I’m afraid if I don’t break free now, I never will. And I so want to start up something I truly feel passionate about, not to mention be my own boss and make my own calls.”

 Elena smiled broadly. “That’s so exciting, Sanjay! But yeah, scary, of course. And it doesn’t surprise me all that much, because it’s seemed like you’ve been restless for a while now. I’m a bit envious you’re willing to take the risk. I’m not sure I could.”

“Yeah, it’s scary, exciting, and energizing all at the same time. I’ve always been so conventional and played it safe. You know how much it matters to me to be a good provider. I don’t know if it’s crazy to even be thinking about tossing aside this solid, high-paying job. But if not now, when? I don’t think I’ve ever pushed myself professionally, and it feels like the right time. Roland’s super creative and has been languishing in his job. He’s got a really great idea for an educational tech product that could be a game changer, and you know I’m passionate about that area. Do you think I should do it?”

“What does Priya think?”

Sanjay’s face fell. “That’s the problem. I don’t think I can tell her now.” Elena looked surprised, so he continued. “You know her. As much as I love her, we both know she’s a worrier. She cares a lot about financial security—and the kids are still young. I’m afraid she won’t understand, or worse, she’ll think I’m being selfish in wanting to pursue a dream at the expense of our family’s well-being. I don’t want to tell her until I’ve thought it completely through and have all my ducks in a row. I’ll tell her once I know for sure I want to do it. For now, I just want to think it through with you.”

Elena’s brow furrowed as she looked down at her drink. Once she collected her thoughts, she said quietly, “Sorry, Sanjay, as much as I want to help, it puts me in a bind. I can’t do that. It wouldn’t be fair to Priya.”

“What do you mean? I thought we had the sort of relationship where we could be open and help each other.”

 “We do,” Elena said.

“Obviously not.”

Elena winced. “Ouch. That’s really painful to hear. First of all, I’m sorry if you feel let down. I do think we have that sort of relationship, which is why I can be honest with you. Sanjay, it’s hard for me to not give you what you want. I want to support you and I so appreciate your confiding in me. But I don’t think this is the best way for me to provide support.”

She paused for a minute, considering her words, then continued, “It’s because I care so much about you that we can’t talk about it until you’ve talked to Priya. What you’re asking of me is at Priya’s expense and actually, Sanjay, at yours, too.”

“What do you mean? Why is it at Priya’s expense? You know her. She’s going to get all upset about it. I don’t want to unnecessarily worry her when I haven’t made up my mind yet. That’s why I need to talk about this with you.”

“Look, Sanjay. There are actually two issues here. One is your question of whether to try this new venture—and that’s actually the easier one—and the other is about how you and Priya are relating to each other.”

“That’s the marriage we have,” Sanjay said with some heat, “and, to be honest, that isn’t your business!”

“Absolutely, it is your marriage. Where it becomes my business is when you’re pulling me in on an issue that really involves Priya. The decision of your possibly starting a business deeply affects her. I care about you, but if I did what you want, it could impact the relationship I have with Priya. She’d be pissed if she found out, and I wouldn’t blame her. But more important, doing what you want would be a disservice to you.”

“A disservice to me?”

Elena nodded. “This decision is just the first of many important ones if you decide to go for the startup. There will be a lot of other decisions that have financial implications. Are you going to keep those from Priya, too? And if you continue to make these decisions without involving her, she’ll feel more and more alienated, and I worry you’d become increasingly distant from each other when you need to feel closer than ever. I totally get that the initial conversation with her will be difficult, but if you have it with me instead, I’d be colluding in the problem—and I don’t want to do that to you. That’s what I mean by doing you a disservice.”

 Sanjay took that in and then said, “I just can’t talk to her about it now. You know how much she tends to worry. That isn’t fair to her.”

“Yes, I do know that part of her, and I know you, and my question is, how much of your choice not to talk to her now is about her and how much is it about you?”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sanjay responded angrily.

“Well,” Elena went on, “I’ve sometimes wondered if you’re too protective of her. For example, when the four of us were at dinner the other night, you told her only the very high-level story of your latest conflict with the management committee. You had a calm, matter-of-fact tone when I knew how angry you were from what you told me at lunch that week.”

“Yeah, but, Elena, you have to admit, Priya makes mountains out of molehills. If I’d told her the full story, she would have thought that I was about to be fired and it would have taken me an hour to peel her off the wall!”

“I get that, and I can appreciate that the way she tends to respond is difficult. But you’re putting all of the problem on her. We’ve talked before about how you hate conflict, and I just wonder if part of your not wanting to discuss this with Priya is about that. Are you protecting her or are you protecting yourself? In any case, if Eric shared the pros and cons of personal decisions as big as this with someone else before me, I would kill him.”

“Well, Priya and I are different, and my marriage is my business. Ugh, I just wish you could support me.”

“I hear you’re not finding me supportive, and I’m sorry about that. I happen to think I’m being very supportive. I’d be happy at some point to be a sounding board, but not as a substitute for Priya. If I’m really going to be a good friend, then I have to tell you that I think there are few things more important than talking with her about all of this now—not later, after you have it all figured out.”

 “I don’t know how this suddenly turned into a discussion about my marriage and my difficulties with conflict. I think we should just end this conversation.” Sanjay finished his drink and started to get up.

“No, Sanjay, let’s not leave quite yet,” Elena said. “We don’t have to talk more about how you and Priya relate—I’ve said my piece. But now, whether we intended to or not, we have an issue with our relationship and running away isn’t going to help. Let’s talk this through.”

Sanjay sat back down but kept his arms crossed. “What do you mean we have an issue with our relationship?”

“You don’t think I’m supporting you, and I think I am,” Elena said. “I see support as being as much about challenging your thinking as about agreeing with you. And I want to support you in the way I would want you to support me, which includes telling me when you think I’m making a mistake. If we kept talking about the startup, it might have made us feel closer in the moment, but it could have been at a high cost to you and your marriage. And if I did it this time, you might keep coming to me and not Priya. As a friend who cares deeply about you, I don’t want to contribute to potentially bad outcomes.”

“So you’ll never talk about Roland’s idea with me?”

“No, I’m not saying that,” Elena said. “I won’t talk about it now, but I will after you talk to Priya. That’s the best way I can support you.”

“Boy,” said Sanjay, “you aren’t letting up on this, are you?”

Elena smiled. “Nope—and I really hope you hear that it’s because I care so much about you.”

Sanjay smiled ruefully and got up to pay the bill. “My treat. Thanks for taking the time to meet with me.” As they walked out together, he added, “This is really hard, and you’re being tough on me…but maybe I need it. There’s a lot for me to think about. I’ll let you know what I do.”

 “You’re being tough on me.” Sanjay’s statement here is correct, and in fact, it’s Elena’s toughness that has transitioned the relationship to exceptional. They were open with each other about their needs and emotions, honest in their interactions, and eventually able to productively handle conflict. Even though Sanjay didn’t think that Elena was on his side early in the conversation, she reiterated that her refusal was primarily coming from what she thought was best for him. At the same time, she didn’t deny her concerns for herself—that allowing Sanjay to use her as a sounding board could ruin her relationship with Priya.

Even though this test left their relationship stronger, it easily could have gone the other way—that was the risk Elena took. After she first set a boundary with Sanjay, he could have stormed out of the bar and written off their friendship.

When a close relationship develops, it’s likely not only that one person will go to the other for help but also that the other, out of a sense of caring and commitment, will feel a strong sense of obligation to comply. That’s the pressure Elena felt. But she chose to push back because she saw the hidden danger and because she thought the upside was worth it. If she hadn’t spoken up, she would have signaled a belief that the friendship couldn’t handle a conflict.

To achieve this positive outcome, they each had to be open to feedback. That was initially hard for Sanjay to hear, and it took more than one comment from Elena for him to see that what he was doing had major costs. Fortunately, she was willing to be persistent until he understood her position, and then she was able to stop (“I’ve said my piece”). Her feedback was information, not a cudgel to beat him over the head with. This interaction also had some learning for Sanjay. It’s still unclear how much responsibility he’ll take for the problematic interactions with his wife, but that issue is plainly out on the table. Equally important is that Elena and Sanjay defined what support really means in an exceptional relationship.

 Even though they have made the transition to exceptional, that doesn’t mean it’s done growing. New situations always arise, and when there’s growth in one area, there are potential challenges in another. Will they be willing to raise and resolve them, or has this been so stressful they won’t dare risk another? Assume that Sanjay works on his ability to face conflict; will he do that in a way that is productive, or will his actions end up feeling punitive. There is no perfect end state in relationships, and that’s part of what makes them both exciting and challenging. The potential for continued learning and growth is not always easy to deal with, but it’s also part of what makes exceptional relationships feel magical.

What made this situation even more difficult is that it involved more than Sanjay and Elena. Each person is in a network of relationships. Elena wanted an exceptional relationship with Sanjay. Sanjay wanted an intimate relationship with Priya, and Elena wanted a close friendship with her. If Elena had gone along with Sanjay’s request, she would have (at least initially) increased their connection but would have weakened each of their relationships with Priya. Growth in one relationship should not be at the expense of another.





The Importance of Toughness


Because of the high level of trust and care between people in an exceptional relationship, it’s likely that each will go to the other with significant requests. But when the other person wants something that you’re unwilling to give, how can you say no without their feeling rejected? Being tough is hard when we fear that it will jeopardize the relationship. And yet not being tough can jeopardize it just as much.

If you are a grandparent, you might be getting tired of being asked to babysit all the time, but you don’t want to risk the closeness you have with your children. An aging parent might be dangerous behind the wheel, and one of your siblings wants you to be the one to tell them they have to stop driving. A friend might ask for a loan, and the idea of saying yes to that might not feel good. But you want to continue to have very close relationships—what to do?

 Our friend Brienna’s brother is a heavy drinker and, unfortunately, not a jovial drunk. For years, when he and his wife came over for dinner, Brienna tolerated his surly behavior. Then she realized that she’d started to dread his visits. She knew that he was under a lot of stress at work and feared that saying anything to him about his drinking would just add more pressure or put distance between them. She didn’t think it was right or fair to talk to his wife about it behind his back, nor did she think that would necessarily help. But the problem had become too prominent to ignore—Brienna feared she would put distance between them if she didn’t say something.

The day after a particularly unpleasant evening out, she called her brother to tell him there was something important she needed to talk to him about. They agreed to meet for coffee a few days later.

“It was one of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had with him,” she told us. “I basically confronted him with how much I disliked being around him when he’s had too much to drink. I told him he was more than welcome to drink as much as he wanted anywhere else or around anybody else, but not when he was with me. I told him I didn’t want to be with him in any social situations unless he would agree to curtail his alcohol intake when I was present. I gave him all my reasons, including how worried I was about what would happen to our relationship if I didn’t raise this issue. We’ve always been close, and I’m pretty sure we both want our relationship to remain that way. He initially argued that I was ‘making a big deal out of nothing’ and being too tough on him, but I held my ground. I told him unless he honored my request, I would not socialize with him anywhere that alcohol might be involved. He eventually agreed to try to honor my request.

“Ever since, when we get together for dinner or are out with mutual friends, he has one scotch on the rocks (instead of four or five). Even though my guess is he still drinks heavily in other situations, he doesn’t do it when we’re together. I think that if I hadn’t said anything—if I hadn’t honored an important personal boundary for me—our relationship would have slowly deteriorated. Instead, we remain close—actually we are much closer.”

 Setting a boundary this way has the potential to feel distancing, but both Brienna and Elena used it to express their wish for even greater closeness. As commonly said, “Good fences make good neighbors.” They also make for deep and intimate relationships.

Being “tough”—which is what both Elena and Brienna were accused of—is not the same thing as being mean or rejecting. Elena didn’t intend to hurt Sanjay, and throughout their conversation, she continued to focus on his behavior, not on his personality. Being honest and speaking to what you think is in another’s best interests can require this sort of toughness, especially when the other wants to go the route of avoidance.

Toughness is also required in receiving feedback. Hearing about the problems caused by your behavior is not easy. But Sanjay was able to eventually do just that. He tried several times to move the conversation away from the subject of his marriage and even started to walk away, but in the end he stuck with it and heard Elena’s feedback. Brienna’s conversation with her brother followed a similar pattern. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to build exceptional relationships with people who are fragile. Both Brienna and Elena understood—and conveyed—that the receiver of the feedback could take it.

Nevertheless, it’s still hard to provide disconfirming feedback without the other person’s feeling rejected. Elena walked this tightrope in several ways. She could have gotten upset because of the way Sanjay put her on the spot and in response to his angry resistance. Instead, she repeatedly told Sanjay the stance she was taking was intended to help, not hurt, him. She focused on what she believed would be best for him, pointed out granting his request would harm him and his marriage, and reiterated that she saw her efforts as the ultimate in support.

 It’s important to note that what Sanjay was asking wasn’t outrageous. It was possible—even likely—that Elena could have talked the startup issue through with Sanjay without Priya’s ever knowing about her role and this could have ended up fine. That’s what made it so challenging for Elena to hold to her position. On the other hand, if he’d said, “Hey, I’m joining this risky startup and I need you to convince Priya it’s a great idea,” he would have crossed a much clearer line. Because his original request appeared reasonable on the surface, it made it that much tougher for Elena to set the boundary she did. And the fact that the situation was so nuanced is what makes this story so important—for these are the situations most likely to trap us.

Just because you have an exceptional relationship with someone, that doesn’t mean you’re invited into every aspect of their life. Sanjay’s angry statement “That’s the marriage we have, and, to be honest, that isn’t your business!” is valid. Sanjay and Priya can decide how they want to relate irrespective of how Elena feels. Let’s imagine that at the meeting over drinks, Sanjay had merely announced that he was thinking about this new venture and said that he wasn’t going to share the decision with his wife. Elena would have had some concerns and, as a very good friend, would have raised them, leaving it up to Sanjay to do with that as he wished.

However, he didn’t just announce his possible plans, he asked for Elena’s advice and counsel, and in some sense, for her emotional support. That pulled her in and made her a potential accessory in the process. That’s what gave her the right to keep raising the issue. She wisely made that distinction in her explanation to Sanjay, increasing the probability of a better reaction from him. Also, note that she was not ordering him to share this issue with Priya; she simply told him very directly that she would not be a sounding board until he did.

Elena made three important choices that deepened the friends’ connection. The first was her decision not to acquiesce to Sanjay’s request. The second was not getting defensive at Sanjay’s comment about their friendship, when he suggested she didn’t care. And the third was not letting Sanjay prematurely close off their meeting. Throughout, she focused on what she believed was best for Sanjay and their relationship, and her commitment to it.

 If she had given way at any of those three choice points, not all would necessarily have been lost. Let’s imagine that she initially agreed to be Sanjay’s sounding board, but that after several meetings, she realized the trap she was falling into. She could then have stated her concern and said that she was not willing to continue colluding. Likewise, if she had lost her cool when Sanjay accused her of disparaging the relationship, a simple apology might have sufficed, followed by a discussion of what support meant to her. And if they had left the bar with the issue unresolved, they could at their next lunch meeting have talked about what still needed to be discussed. Nobody does it perfectly every time.





Elena and Sanjay, Part 6


Elena and Sanjay met for drinks the following week. As soon as they sat down, Elena asked Sanjay how he was doing and whether he’d talked to Priya. He made a face and said he had, but as he’d predicted, it hadn’t gone well. Priya had gotten very upset and claimed that the startup would lead to their financial ruin.

“Did you discuss the other topic?” Elena asked. “About how hard it is to raise issues with her because of how she reacts?”

“No, I didn’t know how to. I was afraid that if I went into that, she’d just deny it or get defensive.”

“I can see that,” Elena said, “but it could have been an opportunity to raise the issue in a way that would be difficult for her to deny. You were experiencing, in that moment, the very response you find so challenging.”

 “I don’t know, Elena. This is hard stuff—I don’t want to make things worse.”

“You can’t expect it to be easy,” Elena said. “The two of you have related to each other in one way for years and now you’re trying to fundamentally change that.”

“You strike a hard bargain, my friend,” Sanjay said. “Okay, I’ll give it a shot.”

It took Sanjay multiple tries over a few weeks, given that Priya initially reacted to these conversations with a great deal of resistance, including anger and accusations that he wasn’t being sensitive to her worries. But Sanjay stayed the course once he became convinced that his marriage would be better off for it.

Remember that once a relationship qualifies as exceptional, it can always continue to grow. Now that Elena and Sanjay’s has been tested, it can handle further issues, such as how Sanjay relates to his wife. Though it might appear that Elena is giving advice and intruding in their marriage, her intent is to be a coach, helping him achieve what he wants. This is another example of the third-party role and what two people on their way to an exceptional relationship can do. She is committed to his growth and development and he knows it, but in a different and more productive way than Sanjay initially requested. Coaching him on how to give feedback to Priya did not compromise her relationship with him or with Priya. Embedded in this example is an assumption that Elena knows Sanjay well enough to understand the kind of marriage he most wants.

Elena’s refusal to discuss the new venture ultimately deepened her relationship with Sanjay. She took a calculated risk; there was no guarantee that it would work out, but she wagered that the potential benefit made the risk worth it. They learned that their friendship could not only survive but be even richer than it already was. Sanjay saw how deeply Elena cared for him, precisely because she was willing to take that risk, and each of them learned more about themselves in the process. Because they had built a strong foundation and they had the skills and competencies to have a productive though difficult conversation, Elena’s gamble paid off. The more commitment there is to the relationship, and the higher the level of skills and competencies two people have when faced with an interpersonal test, the higher the probability that leaning into difficult conversations will be worth it.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Elena’s situation. She was in a tough spot. She worried that if she didn’t accede to Sanjay’s request, he would feel rejected and their relationship would suffer. What would you probably do? Review all of the choice points that Elena faced in the story; how would you have likely responded? What would you conclude about how you handle situations like this?



Key Relationship: Take one of your key relationships in which there might be some ambiguity as to what you can expect from the other. Write down what you think is perfectly fine for you to ask for, followed by what is clearly not. Then write down the requests you are not sure about.





APPLICATION


Go to the person you identified in the second question above and share what you wrote. (You might want to first ask them to do the same analysis with regard to what they think they can/can’t ask of you.) Then clarify areas where there is ambiguity.





MAKING SENSE


Talking about boundaries is difficult, as setting a boundary can be experienced as rejection. Were you able to raise the topic directly without having the other feel distanced? When they talked about boundaries, how did you feel? What was the effect of your discussion on your relationship? How did it impact your level of closeness?
