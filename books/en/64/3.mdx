Elena and Sanjay—Work Colleagues, Parts 1 and 2


Most of us have countless interactions each day with people who don’t really know us well. You say hi and exchange pleasantries with your local grocer. Your neighbor may know how many children you have and where you work, maybe even where you last vacationed, but not much else. You have friends with whom you periodically have dinner, and they know you better, but there are still vast aspects of your life they don’t know. At times, you may yearn for deeper and more meaningful connections, but you don’t always know how to get there.

Letting yourself be more fully known is crucial to developing exceptional relationships. Self-disclosure creates more opportunities to connect and increases trust. It is also enormously validating to be accepted for who you really are. That said, it’s not risk-free.

Carole once led a retreat with a dozen Silicon Valley executives where she felt flat and disconnected. She was distracted by outside important events going on for her and was finding it hard to concentrate. Not only were these significant clients, but as the “teacher” she felt especially vulnerable. What if it didn’t go well? How would she be seen? What would happen if she admitted what was going on for her? Rather than trying to fake it, which she might have done earlier in her career, she decided to live what she teaches and disclose all that she was feeling—including the fact that she felt vulnerable sharing these feelings. The moment she opened up, she felt more connected. Some executives thanked her for breaking the ice and said they were also feeling flat and disconnected.

In this chapter, we cover what it takes to be really known by someone else, which isn’t as simple as it may seem. What happens if you’re authentic and open but then misunderstood? Or what if your openness overwhelms the other person? What role do emotions play in self-disclosure? What are you willing to risk in order to be better known?





Elena and Sanjay, Part 1


Elena felt conflicted as she left her desk to meet her colleague Sanjay for lunch. She’d had an issue with a co-worker in the morning—the co-worker had tried to push something back onto Elena’s plate that he’d agreed to do weeks before. Elena had held her ground, and the co-worker had gotten upset and snapped at her. She wanted to get Sanjay’s take on it, but she worried that he might think that she hadn’t handled the situation well, or that she was overreacting.

Even though they worked in different departments, Elena and Sanjay had gotten to know each other when they were each assigned to the tech review task force a year before. Elena loved working with Sanjay, whom she found to be a creative problem-solver and generous team member. They were able both to build on each other’s ideas and to disagree in productive ways.

After the task force’s work had ended, they’d started having lunch together periodically so they could catch up. They were both avid outdoors people and would compare notes on gear deals and the best camping spots. Sanjay enjoyed camping with his family, and Elena was an avid white-water kayaker.

Elena really valued her friendship with Sanjay. She had a lot of friends outside of work, but she couldn’t “talk shop” with them, and they couldn’t grasp all of the nuances of her workplace. In her last position, she’d stumbled—and lost her job—because she’d been direct and open about her opinions, which didn’t fit the company culture. In her new position, she wanted to find somebody she trusted for advice, someone who knew the ins and outs of how things got done. She thought Sanjay might be that person.

 But what if Sanjay took any overtures the wrong way? They were both married, and all she wanted was a friendship. Also, what would happen if she told Sanjay what had occurred at her old company, some of which she wasn’t proud of? She decided she’d better be careful.

They got their food at the cafeteria line and found an empty table. “How’s your week going?” Sanjay asked.

“Well, the usual ups and downs,” Elena said, still unsure what to share.

Sanjay didn’t pick up on her statement and instead, with much enthusiasm, talked about his weekend camping trip. “You were right about that campsite—it’s amazing,” he said. “But I want to go back when I’m not chasing a toddler around the whole time.”

Elena thought perhaps it was a good thing she hadn’t told Sanjay about her morning conflict. He hadn’t picked up her cue or pressed for more information. Elena also felt a twinge of envy about Sanjay’s weekend with his kids, because she’d been trying to get pregnant. She decided against disclosing that, since it felt far too personal. Instead, she offered more tips about other campsites.

When the conversation shifted to company issues, Elena decided to go for it and share a few details about her morning. “As much as I enjoy working here,” she said after she’d given him a summary of the morning’s incident with her co-worker, “moments like that make me a bit crazy.”

Sanjay listened intently. “I’ve had that happen to me, too, and it drives me up a wall,” he said. “In fact, it happened with one of my direct reports just yesterday.” He shared a few further details, and Elena felt relieved and a bit closer to him.

She considered asking his advice about how to deal with her somewhat difficult boss but decided against it for fear it would lead her inadvertently to disclose her past experience of having been fired. She felt relieved when the conversation shifted to their reactions to a recent announcement from the CEO. As Sanjay and Elena got up to bus their dishes, they each said how much they’d enjoyed the lunch.



* * *



—

 Elena played it pretty safe, which we get. Every time you disclose something personal, you risk being misunderstood; the fear that the disclosure will result in judgment or rejection is very real. We all filter information through our own past experiences, some of which can be so significant they distort how we respond in the present. For instance, we consulted for a Fortune 500 company where a senior VP would rarely speak up in meetings. Turns out, several years before, he had been summarily fired after taking a firm stance on an issue. He’d been rehired the next day, but he felt so burnt that he never disagreed or offered a strong opinion again. Others are impacted by judgmental statements by parents (“You are a lazy person”) that they hold on to for years, causing them to be extremely sensitive to any comment that might reinforce that judgment.

Fear of disclosure can pop up anywhere along the arc of a relationship, because you share more as a relationship grows. However, the fear is particularly acute early on. When the other person doesn’t know you well, they don’t have the context with which to understand the full meaning of your actions. Will they read more into what you’ve said or done than what’s there? Even worse, will they get locked into an opinion about you, or a judgment, and not take in any new disconfirming information? There’s an old adage: “To know all is to forgive all.” If someone knew all the circumstances that led you to behave a certain way, they would be more likely to forgive what might initially seem egregious. But it’s not necessarily so simple. You can’t share everything about yourself at once or too early in the process of becoming known.

 For example, in the third week of an Interpersonal Dynamics class David taught, he was still building a connection with the students. The topic that day was the importance of getting help from others. He wanted to model more openness and shared the value he found in therapy. One student responded, “I respect you less because I see that as a sign of weakness; I think people should solve their own problems.”

In a similar vein, Carole once mentioned to a client that Judaism provided her with a “user’s manual for life.” He was taken aback and said, “I can’t believe a person as intelligent as you would fall for that religious BS. It makes me question whether you can be as helpful to me as I thought.”

In both situations where our disclosures created bumps, we initially felt defensive and misunderstood, but our greater concern was that they would limit our effectiveness. Would the student stop listening to David and maybe get less out of the course? Would the client be resistant to Carole’s coaching? Fortunately, neither of those concerns came true, because there was continued contact in the class and in the coaching engagement. Both the student and the client grew to know us more fully, overriding their initial skepticism. But not all situations allow the luxury of continued contact and a chance to adjust early impressions.

We also had the benefit of knowing how our student and client had reacted to our statements (as disconcerting as those reactions were) because they told us. That’s often not the case. Particularly early on in a relationship, you may not know how the other’s reacting. They’re unlikely to say, “What you just said really bothered me.” Generally, all you have to go on is body language or tone, which can be ambiguous. Their furrowed brow could be a sign of disapproval—or maybe they’re just unhappy about something in their life and their reaction has nothing to do with you.

 The point is, it’s a risk. But there’s also risk in playing your cards too close to your vest; unfortunately, the closer I hold my cards, the closer you are likely to hold yours. You can’t get to deeper relationships without disclosure.

So how much should you disclose? And when? There are no definitive answers to those questions, but in our experience, people are generally too cautious—they could be sharing more, sooner than they think.





The 15 Percent Rule


Consciously or unconsciously, you’re always assessing what’s appropriate to share in any given interaction. Those decisions are highly dependent on the context, how you feel about risk, and, especially, the state of the relationship.

Elena’s decision not to share the circumstances under which she was fired or her difficulties in getting pregnant made sense, given the situation. If Elena had mentioned her firing to Sanjay, he could potentially have judged her negatively, not knowing the specifics of the situation and not knowing her that well. Similarly, Sanjay might have felt uncomfortable if she’d shared her fertility fears, as that is quite personal territory. However, Elena played it very safe by talking about camping and the CEO’s announcement—there was little personal disclosure in that. Yes, she dipped her toe in the water by mentioning a disagreement with a co-worker, but she didn’t press it very far. Their lunch conversation, although friendly, probably didn’t significantly help to build the sort of relationship she wanted. Discretion may be the better part of valor, but most people err, like Elena, on the side of caution, causing the relationship to stagnate.

How to address this dilemma? One way is what we suggest to students: “Try the 15 Percent Rule.” Consider three concentric rings that represent decreasing safety as you move out from the center. The smallest ring, in the middle, is the Zone of Comfort. This refers to what you say or do that you don’t think twice about and with which you feel completely safe. The outermost ring is the Zone of Danger—things you wouldn’t consider doing or saying given the high likelihood that the outcome would be negative. The ring between “Comfort” and “Danger” is known as the Zone of Learning and is where you are unsure about how another will respond. That is typically the zone in which people learn. In response to students’ concerns about venturing into Learning at the risk of unintentionally ending up in Danger, we suggest testing the waters by stretching into the zone of learning by 15 percent as shown below. The downside of this moderate approach is not likely to be disastrous and, if the interaction is successful, can help you be further known. With that success, you can then consider venturing out another 15 percent from there.





The 15 Percent Rule is not an absolute; its value is in helping you consider possible choices. Imagine you’re with a friend and wonder how that person feels about you. You can stay within your comfort zone by saying something relatively safe, like, “Sometimes I worry about what others think of me.” Somewhat riskier and 15 percent outside your comfort zone might be, “I made a comment about our mutual friend Michael last week and have been worrying about how you felt about me ever since.”

 Going outside your comfort zone is fundamental to learning. For example, when you first begin to ski, you start on a “bunny slope,” not a double black diamond. Once you’ve mastered the bunny slope, you can’t become a better skier unless you move to a more challenging run (15 percent). At the top of that new run, you might feel afraid or exhilarated—or maybe both at once. But after you spend enough time there, you’ll find your comfort zone has expanded, and you are ready to move to the next harder run (the next 15 percent), and so on. Sure, if you want to avoid that feeling of fear, you could stick to the bunny slope. But that won’t make you a better skier. The same process of continuously stretching yourself is key to building relationships and serves as the basis for continuous disclosure.

So what could 15 percent have looked like for Elena? She didn’t have to reveal that she’d been terminated in her previous job (that might have actually been an example of stepping into the danger zone), but she could have talked about what she found unpleasant about her previous company. Instead of just describing her co-worker’s annoying behavior that morning, she could have asked Sanjay how he would have handled that situation. Or she could have taken more of a risk and shared that sometimes she fears she’s too rigid. It’s unlikely there would have been disastrous consequences from any of these disclosures, and they might have moved the relationship beyond just discussing camping.

There are a few important caveats to the 15 Percent Rule. First, it’s subjective: a 15 percent move for me might seem low risk for you and extreme for a third person. Talking about therapy might be in your 15 percent zone if you’re thirty-five years old and live in New York but well outside your 15 percent zone if you’re a fifty-five-year-old in rural England. Second, you have to take into account the impact of your disclosures on the other person. For example, you wouldn’t want to share a detailed argument you had with your mother with someone who had just lost her own. And third, you have to gauge the situational appropriateness. What might work in a one-to-one conversation might not at a larger dinner party.





What Emotions Have to Do with It


Sharing facts starts to build a larger picture of who we are but only goes so far. What tends to have more impact is sharing feelings. The important distinction is between cognitions (thoughts), which tell what is, and emotions (feelings), which tell how important it is. (Even though they are not exactly the same, for simplicity we use “feelings” and “emotions” interchangeably in this book.) Two people who experience the same event can have very different emotional reactions. They both might have been fired from their job, yet one is devastated, while the other feels challenged.

The other benefit of emotions is that they actually give meaning to facts. Elena could find kayaking exhilarating or frightening. It can be empowering because she initiated the adventure or disempowering because her friends coerced her into doing it. The objective event carries totally different information depending on the emotions attached to it.

Feelings also can indicate the intensity of an experience. In reacting to another’s behavior, you could be slightly bothered, annoyed, upset, angry, or furious. These different degrees are crucial in human interaction; they illustrate a lot about who you are. Emotions provide color, drawing others to us in a way that being utterly unemotional and rational does not.

Think of it as music. What makes an opera piece rich is the variety of tones, ranging from high sopranos to deep baritones. In the same way that a great musical score requires both high treble and lower bass notes, to communicate well we must express thoughts/cognitions and feelings/emotions.

What would Sanjay and Elena’s interaction have been like if she had expressed emotions in addition to thoughts? Elena had roughly twelve different feelings in the moderate-to-strong range over the course of this lunch, yet she expressed none of them.

  THOUGHTS/​COGNITION FEELINGS ELENA HAD

 Elena’s sharing perceptions of the company

 Connection with Sanjay, reassurance that she wasn’t alone in her feelings



Elena’s not sharing being fired

 Concern/apprehension about how Sanjay might judge her



Elena’s difficulty in getting pregnant

 Sadness because she doesn’t have a child of her own, envy at Sanjay’s having a child, fear of sharing any of this as being too personal



Elena’s disagreement with her colleague

 Worry about how Sanjay might see her, relief at how he responded, closeness to Sanjay because of that



Discussion of the CEO’s memo

 Relief that the conversation shifted away from her



Sanjay’s saying he enjoyed the lunch

 Happiness that Sanjay also liked the lunch, anticipation about their next meeting





This is not to argue that Elena should have shared every one of these emotions. The 15 Percent Rule applies to emotions, too; it would probably be too far to go, for instance, for her to express her sadness, envy, and fear over her difficulty conceiving. But there were plenty of other options to choose from and ways to stretch herself if she wanted to be closer to Sanjay. What might have happened if Elena had expressed some of her feelings?

After Elena told Sanjay about her morning conflict and he disclosed similar interactions, she felt increasingly at ease. Let’s revisit their conversation and imagine that Elena expressed her feelings, telling Sanjay:

“I’m feeling reassured by our conversation. I thought I was the only one who felt this way. I really appreciate your openness and it puts me more at ease.”

 Sanjay smiled at her and said, “Great! Glad to hear that.”

Elena had also been thinking about how much better this company was than her old one, but disclosing that she had been terminated was beyond her 15 percent comfort zone. To verbalize her emotions, she could have said:

“Aside from the stuff that bugs us, Sanjay, I’m really enjoying working here. It’s so different from where I worked before, which was toxic, and I sometimes felt scared to speak up. And it didn’t turn out well.”

In saying this, Elena stepped outside her comfort zone. The conversation might now unfold in a number of different ways:

Sanjay says, “That’s too bad,” and changes the subject. Elena has a choice whether to proceed or just drop the topic.



Sanjay responds by asking, “What was that like?” Elena starts by saying, “It was really awful and I’m just glad I’m out.” She can now assess his response and stop there or continue to make subsequent disclosures.



Sanjay expresses a feeling in response, being a bit more personal but within his comfort zone. “That sounds really tough; I’m sorry you had to go through that.” Elena is now at another decision point and has many options. She can take a breath, take a 15 percent higher risk, and reveal what happened in the past. Or she can decide that’s enough and say, “I don’t need to go into more of the details right now, but I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your empathy.”





To give another example, when Sanjay talked about his recent camping trip and Elena felt the twinge of envy, she could have said:

“That sounds like fun to me, and I have to admit I’m a little envious. My husband, Eric, and I have been hoping to get pregnant, and frankly I can’t wait.”

 This scenario, like the prior one, could unfold in a number of different ways, depending partly on how Sanjay reacts and partly on how much of a risk Elena is willing to take.

Sanjay might be quiet for a moment or change the subject. Again, Elena has choices: She could drop the issue or continue. However, if Sanjay responded with something like “Yeah, my kid is a lot of fun,” Elena could share her hopes and expectations. Let’s say he stepped outside his comfort zone with some personal statement, such as, “He’s both fun and a lot more work than my wife and I ever expected; I sure hope I’m doing right by him.” Elena could then increase the reciprocal self-disclosure by talking about the frustrations she and her husband have been feeling, and perhaps disclosing that they’re considering seeing a fertility specialist. Eventually, they might even move to a level of comfort in which she might talk about how the issue is even more charged and difficult for her to talk about given that women in the workplace are sometimes put in a “mommy/less ambitious” bucket when they have or want to have children. Sanjay’s reaction to that would undoubtedly impact how much more she’d be willing to share. Elena’s two antennae, tuned to Sanjay’s reactions and her own, can inform her choices.





Why Emotions Get a Bad Rap


If emotions are so valuable, why do we downplay them? In many cultures, logic and rationality hold sway as the coin of the realm. This is true in most education; one doesn’t earn an A in math by saying, “I feel better by selecting twenty-three.” Likewise, in many work settings, managers say, “Leave feelings out of this”—even though they refer to their own emotions constantly (“I am annoyed that this report is late”; “I am excited that we were awarded the new contract”; “I am worried that we’re going to lose this customer”).

We also tend to stigmatize “being emotional” and are advised not to “wear our emotions on our sleeves.” Men, in particular, are socialized not to display emotion, while women who work in male-dominated environments often feel conflicted about how much emotion to show for fear of being seen as too sensitive and insufficiently tough, or as “dramatic.” Fortunately, norms are changing. An important influence was Daniel Goleman’s seminal work on emotional intelligence, which showed that being in touch with one’s emotions and expressing them appropriately was a key determinant in leadership success. In the past, many men considered it taboo to express emotions, but nowadays, it is more acceptable—and even desirable. Still, many of these stereotypes persist.

 Emotions sometimes appear contradictory, which also works against our willingness to share them. You can be excited about a conversation and a bit apprehensive about where it might lead. You may feel hurt by someone’s feedback but also grateful that they’ve taken the risk of raising a difficult topic. In those situations, you may go silent as you try to determine what the right feeling is.

For example, imagine that it’s Friday, you’ve had a stressful week, and you’re barely holding yourself together. All you want to do is collapse on the couch with a good book. Your significant other greets you at the door and announces plans for an exciting evening out at a special restaurant, followed by dancing. Normally, you would welcome a plan like this, but right now it sounds like torture. However, you’re appreciative of your partner’s attempt to perk you up.

What do you do? You could suck it up and go along—maybe you would enjoy it, but probably you’d end up feeling frustrated and even more exhausted. You could decline, but that runs the risk of your partner’s feeling rejected—and your feeling guilty for spoiling the fun. Neither choice is ideal. But there is an alternative: We call it Hamlet’s quandary, “to share, or not to share.” Rather than trying to resolve the problem by deciding whether to go along or not, why not just name the dilemma? “Honey, I really appreciate what you’ve planned. It shows me how much you care that I’ve had a tough week. But I’m so exhausted and don’t want to go along just because of your effort. Could we figure out something that would work for both of us?” That opens up a range of possibilities that could meet both parties’ needs.

 Elena, too, could have shared her dilemma. Instead of shutting down the discussion of her past job, she could have said, “It was something that I might not have handled well. I’ve been hesitant to share it out of concern about what you’ll think of me and worry that it would damage our working relationship.” Sharing both sides of the quandary allows a fuller expression of the issues. The other learns more about not only what’s important to you but also what is blocking you. Yes, this disclosure increases your vulnerability, but that’s the price of potentially deepening the connection.

We have one more important point to make about expressing feelings, and it’s all about the language we use to do so. Both of us are fanatical about how the phrase “I feel” is used, because it can be used in two different ways—one useful, and one misleading. It can be used to express an emotion, as in “I feel upset by your comment,” or it can express a thought/cognition, as in “I feel like you want to dominate this conversation.” Because we place such high value on emotions in interpersonal relations, we drive our family and friends crazy by constantly reminding them to use the term “feel” only to express an emotion.

There are two ways to tell whether your “I feel” statement is really expressing an emotion. The first is paying attention to the word that follows “I feel.” If that word isn’t an adjective describing an emotion (such as “sad” or “angry”), you should be skeptical. If it is “like,” “that,” or “as,” you are unlikely to be describing an emotion. It’s grammatically impossible (at least in English) to express a feeling when you say, “I feel that” or “I feel like.” We don’t say “I feel that angry.” Or “I feel like sad.” You can also try a simple substitution. If you can replace “feel” or “feel like” with “think” and the sentence still makes sense, then you haven’t expressed an emotion. For example, “I feel that you want to dominate” and “I think you want to dominate” convey the same meaning—because both are cognitions, not feelings.

 This may seem overly precise, but stick with us, because it’s important. Think of the difference between “I feel irritated and dismissed” and “I feel that you don’t care.” The shift in language might be subtle, but the impact is profound. “I feel that you really don’t care about my opinion” contains no feeling words, although it is likely that there are some strong feelings unstated! (Note that you could drop the “I feel that” and the sentence would not change.) “I feel irritated and dismissed” is a statement about me whereas “I feel that you don’t care” is an accusation that is likely to cause defensiveness.





A Wealth of Choices


An idea that’s central to this book is that in any given situation, you have many choices about how to respond. You may feel limited by the impression you want to make, but you still have a choice. You may be influenced by the other’s response—but that, too, is a choice. Even though Elena might be impacted by how Sanjay reacts, her responses need not be determined by that reaction. Sanjay’s responses along the way will make it easier or more challenging for Elena to decide whether to further disclose or not—but it’s always ultimately her call.

Social scientists call the belief in our ability to act in the world “having agency.” Too often, people think they have no choice in how to respond to what has happened to them. Throughout this book, you’ll see a variety of approaches that describe how we have more agency and can be more impactful than we initially think. This is an important mindset because moving to deeper, more meaningful, and exceptional relationships will require challenging choices.

Our emphasis on choices, having influence, and acting with agency is not to imply that you can build an exceptional relationship on your own. Relationships are co-determined. Nevertheless, you can take steps that increase the chance that the other will join you in this journey. Nor does having a choice deny the impact of external factors. Elena and Sanjay, for example, are impacted by conventional business culture norms that discourage friendships at work that are “too personal,” particularly if there is the possibility of anything romantic. That said, external factors can also encourage us to move outside our comfort zone, as happened with Elena a couple of months later.





Elena and Sanjay, Part 2


Sanjay and Elena continued to meet for lunch, usually every Thursday, and got to know each other better. One Thursday, Elena was especially looking forward to their meeting because she’d had a troubling incident with her boss. She asked if Sanjay would help her think it through, and he said he would be happy to.

“I’m not sure how well you know Rick,” she began, “or if you’ve ever worked with him.”

“I don’t know him very well at all. Why? What’s going on?”

“He gives me assignments that sound like he wants me to look into something,” Elena began, “but then he’s unhappy when I suggest an approach he doesn’t like. A while ago he asked me to research whether we should invest our trade show budget in local, regional, or national shows. I spent a good chunk of time doing the research, including speaking to all the stakeholders. Yesterday, I made the recommendation at our staff meeting and he immediately shot it down, saying it wasn’t the recommendation he was looking for. He thanked me tersely and dismissed my analysis. That’s just one example, but he’s done that several times over the last few months.”

“That sounds frustrating. Maybe you could go talk to him and let him know that it’s becoming a problem that you want to address before it gets any bigger?”

Elena hesitated. “Yeah, I could…but I don’t think so.”

“Why not?”

 “I just don’t think it would end well.”

Sanjay, wanting to understand more about Elena’s resistance, asked, “How do you know? What’s holding you back?”

“I’m not sure Rick would be very open, and he might get upset.”

Sanjay, being the intuitive guy Elena likes so much, said, “Sounds like there’s more to that.”

Sanjay, of course, was right. Elena was on the verge of self-disclosure and was scared. She worried that telling Sanjay about what had happened at her last job would change his opinion of her. But she realized that if she was going to have the relationship she really wanted with Sanjay, she had to take the risk of being even more vulnerable.

Sanjay could tell Elena was struggling with something. He sat patiently, waiting for her to continue.

Elena took a deep breath and finally said, “This feels really risky for me to share. You’ve heard me talk about how toxic the culture was at my old company. What I haven’t told you is the difficulty I had with that boss. I could never seem to please him, and when I went to see him to talk about it, I got into trouble. The discussion started off civilly enough, but then he made one excuse after another, and the more he did that, the more upset I got. Here I was, trying to work it out, and he was just brushing the whole thing aside. I lost it and started yelling at him. I rarely ever raise my voice, but I was just so frustrated. And then I was fired.”

Sanjay nodded sympathetically. “That really sounds tough.”

A bit reassured, Elena continued, “I guess I’m still unnerved about that incident. As I said, I’m usually composed, but I guess that I’m afraid of going to Rick and having this thing happen again.”

Sanjay leaned forward and quietly said, “But that was that boss in that company, and this is a different boss.”

Elena nodded thoughtfully. “I’ve been worried about telling you this. I didn’t know if you would think I’m too emotional or not competent. And I was afraid it would damage how we relate to each other. I just feel so crummy about what happened. It’s really hard for me to talk about. And I really don’t want to put you in an awkward position.”

 “Wow, Elena, I had no idea you were sitting on all this, and I’m so sorry you held that back. I don’t see you as overly emotional—you certainly weren’t that way on the tech task force. Actually, I admire your courage in telling me. It must have been hard to say all of this.”

Elena breathed a big sigh of relief. “You have no idea how much your response means to me, Sanjay. I worry about being stereotyped as the emotional female. That’s what my previous boss accused me of, when I think I had a good reason to be mad.”

Sanjay nodded vigorously. “Seems like you’re carrying a lot over from that past experience. Be careful of that in dealing with Rick. Generally, you can be fairly direct with managers here.” After a pause, Sanjay said, “It makes me realize there are things I’ve held back from you, too, not knowing how you would react.”

“Really? You worry about that, too?”

“Yeah, definitely. I really value our friendship; I don’t have many like it in the company and especially with any women. I’m a happily married man, and you know how much I love Priya. But we can’t always talk about my work, because she can’t fully relate, you know? Just because I like talking with you doesn’t mean I’m looking for anything inappropriate—but it makes me nervous what others might think or even what you might think. Talk about feeling vulnerable! Just saying all this is weird,” he said with a nervous smile.

“I know exactly what you mean,” Elena said. “I feel nervous about our friendship, too. I’m so glad we can talk about this.”





The Vulnerability Question


During past lunches, Elena had started to disclose more, but gingerly. The day she told Sanjay about being fired, she took not just one move outside her comfort zone but several. It could have been because of an increase in trust, or because she really needed to talk with someone about Rick, or because she realized that if she wanted a closer work relationship, there was no better time. Whatever the reason, Elena again had choices. And she chose to be vulnerable.

 Now, there is vulnerability and there is vulnerability. Early in our experience with T-groups, we were struck by the fact that some disclosures had more impact than others and wondered why. Then David got some feedback that suggested an answer. Early in his professional life, David saw the power of being more open and had a relatively easy time divulging personal information. Then one day a friend said, “You do a good job of revealing things about yourself, but you are rarely vulnerable.” At first, David felt hurt and misunderstood. Then he put it together with what he’d observed with students.

What feels risky and most vulnerable is when you are especially uncertain about the impact of your disclosure. If you have disclosed something (even if it is very personal) multiple times in similar settings and you have a pretty good sense of how others are going to react, even if it’s negatively, you’ll feel far less vulnerable than if you are sharing something you have never said to anyone. David knew his students felt the most vulnerable when they didn’t know whether they would be accepted or rejected, praised or pitied. That kind of vulnerability brought others closer.

That was what made their self-disclosure truly vulnerable. And it was only when David understood that distinction and was able to make himself known in a much riskier way that he found others trusted him more fully.

For instance, David once taught a session on self-disclosure in a Stanford executive program, with some university faculty also in attendance. He wanted to model what he was teaching, so he swallowed twice and disclosed that years before he had been turned down for tenure. Though David had shared that fact before, what made the disclosure particularly vulnerable was that there was a tenured professor among the participants and David worried he would lose credibility. Then David took his disclosure a step further and revealed his feelings of worry and insecurity about sharing that fact. Carole remembers thinking about how gutsy that was, and many participants commented that it gave them a much more visceral sense of how disclosure builds connection. (In fact, to take this even further, David has some concerns about sharing this information in a book for all to see. That, friends, is vulnerability!)

 One common concern people have about disclosure—especially when it involves revealing things that might appear as defects—is that others will see them as weak. We see it differently. It takes fortitude and internal strength to self-disclose. That’s what Sanjay responded to when he told Elena, “I admire your courage in telling me. It must have been hard to say all of this.”

Leaders, especially, are often afraid to reveal personal information that defies the perception that they totally have their act together—what if others respect them less? If the disclosure casts doubt on the person’s competence to do the job, then sharing that information can cause a loss of influence and respect, but otherwise it helps the leader be seen as more human. We will return to this in more detail in the next chapter, but a leader who is not willing to be vulnerable sets a norm that does not encourage any others in the organization to do that either. The only way for a leader to legitimize self-disclosure is to model it.

David once facilitated a retreat for the executive team of a Fortune 500 company. Over dessert the first evening, conversation turned to the pressures the members were under. Some of these were work related and some were personal. Everybody knew that Frank’s wife was very ill, but they were ignorant of the details. He hesitantly shared how painful the situation was and started to tear up. He quickly apologized as he tried to gain control. “No, no, that’s all right!” his colleagues exclaimed. They then shared how moved they were by his disclosure and how impressed they were by how he was handling his wife’s situation.

In her work with CEO/founders in Silicon Valley, Carole repeatedly hears how thirsty they are for this type of authenticity, how afraid they are to be vulnerable, and how deeply ingrained their beliefs are that demonstrating any of this will result in their being seen as weak. And yet, over and over, they feel reassured when they stop spinning their image and discover that others in their life see them as stronger and more (not less) credible when they take that risk.





The Costs of Silence


Even safe or bland comments are not risk-free. In the absence of data, people will make stuff up. Everybody draws conclusions when interacting with others. The less we reveal, the more others will fill in the blanks in order to make sense of what they see. When we are too reserved with our feelings, we actually lose control over how we are seen.

A different kind of silence occurs when we only share an image of ourselves—in those cases, the other can’t see or know who we really are, including the parts that are more interesting. Even if we are successful in selling our image, this is a hollow victory. It just confirms that the real me is undesirable. Furthermore, as the noted French author François de La Rochefoucauld once said, “We’re so accustomed to disguising ourselves to others that in the end we become disguised to ourselves.”

Just as bad, once we’ve come to be known a certain way, we often feel bound to behave consistently, becoming less and less truly known. The cost is more isolation and what we call “the Creeping Constraint of Secrets.” Important parts of ourselves are often related to other aspects of who we are. Hiding one part can lead to hiding much more, resulting in progressive impoverishment of what we show and, ultimately, of our relationships.

This was dramatically illustrated by a friend who is gay and talked about his life before he came out. “There were major parts of myself that I had to keep secret,” he told us. “Obviously being gay, but also topics that might be related, no matter how tangential. I had to be circumspect about whether I was romantically involved with anybody. I couldn’t have any pictures of my partner on my desk. I had to be very careful talking about what I had done on my recent vacation because I might slip and mention ‘we’ or, God forbid, ‘he.’ I didn’t encourage social engagements with co-workers. I avoided political discussions that might lead to topics like gay marriage, so many of my conversations remained at rather superficial levels. And, worst of all, I had to force myself to keep quiet if somebody made a homophobic comment. As time went on, others came to know a smaller and smaller piece of who I am.”

 Constraints like these are everywhere. Even though Stanford tries to enroll students from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, students from affluent families feel comfortable booking getaways to Napa Valley for wine tasting or talking about all the countries they’ve visited. This means that those who are on full scholarship are often silent about their background, go into further debt so as to participate in renting ski houses, and tend to be quiet when others share their globetrotting adventures. Devoutly religious students often feel constrained from sharing their religious beliefs out of concern for others’ judgment.

It’s not until these students find themselves in the Interpersonal Dynamics group that they feel safe enough to share their values, their background, their fears, and their hopes and dreams. That’s often when they recognize the costs they have paid for not sharing more about who they really are. Every time we observe this awakening, we double down on the importance of building exceptional relationships—because while we can’t all be in a T-group, we all can learn to create a safer space to self-disclose and become more known.





Why More Is Sometimes Better Than Less


What comes first, safety or disclosure? It can be easy to think, “Until I know I can trust that person and be accepted, I’m not going to take the risk of disclosing. I need to first know how they’re going to respond.” We argue that the causal direction has to be reversed—that risking a 15 percent disclosure is what builds safety. If each person waits for the other to take a risk, little progress is ever made.

 To make matters more challenging, one disclosure may not get the result you want. That happened with Elena when she hinted at something by saying, “Well, the usual ups and downs.” Sanjay did not pick up on that, and Elena didn’t elaborate. Too often, people put their toe in the water with a small disclosure and then stop in the absence of a response. You might need to take a slightly more noticeable risk before the other person responds. That occurred when Elena later risked sharing what led to her being fired and her fear that it might happen again. She was fully 15 percent out of her comfort zone. What if Sanjay had instead responded, “That’s unlikely to happen here and maybe you should just let go of the past.” If he had, here again Elena would have had choices. She could have shrugged off his comment and changed the conversation to another subject, or she could have taken another risk and gone back to saying more about the problems with her boss.

It would no doubt have stung if Sanjay hadn’t responded positively, but it’s unlikely that Elena would have dissolved in a puddle. People are rarely that fragile. And taking the risk when you don’t know the outcome is central to building deep personal relationships. On this journey, you have to trust the process, believing that in the long run, by disclosing first, you are more likely to build trust, gain acceptance, and achieve the relationship you most want. This is what “having agency” is all about.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Elena’s position. You still feel bruised from being fired in your previous job, and the last thing you want is to have it happen again. Part of the problem is that you didn’t know the culture. You like Sanjay and enjoyed working with him on the task force. Could he be a person you could be open with and who could help you learn how to succeed in this company? You would like a relationship where you can share what is important, but will he negatively misjudge you?

 How do you think you would go about letting yourself be more fully known? Consider the different choice points that Elena had in this chapter. What would you have said? What does this say about your ease (or difficulty) in letting yourself be more fully known in professional situations like this?





Being Known: More broadly, how easy is it for you to let others know what is important to you? What do you find most difficult to share? What are your concerns about sharing that?



Key Relationship: Take one of the key people whom you listed in the last chapter. Are there things about you that are relevant to that relationship that you haven’t fully shared? What are your concerns about disclosing these?



Disclosing Emotions: How easy/challenging is it for you to share your emotions? Look over the Vocabulary of Feelings in Appendix A. Are there some feelings that are more difficult than others for you to express?





APPLICATION


In number 3 above, you identified some issues relevant to that relationship. What could you share that would be 15 percent outside your comfort zone?

Note that there are two areas of potential self-disclosure. The first is content, but the second is your feelings and concerns about sharing the content. Elena disclosed both levels in her self-disclosure. To what extent did you share both in the conversation above?

 This coming week, in conversations with friends and acquaintances, try dropping your level of personal disclosure to share things beyond your comfort zone that you might not normally have shared. These could be facts, opinions, or feelings.





MAKING SENSE


What did you learn from your self-disclosure with the one person you chose above? In your self-reflection, you were asked what concerns you might have about disclosing. How have those changed? What did you learn about yourself from doing this, and how did it impact the relationship?

What was it like being more personal in your interactions with others? How did it feel doing that? Did it have an effect on the nature of those interactions?

How are you going to apply what you learned in future interactions? (Be specific about what you might do with different individuals.)
