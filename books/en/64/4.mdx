Ben and Liam—Buddies, Parts 1 and 2


You can’t build an exceptional relationship all on your own. You can’t grow closer with someone who never ventures beyond small talk. You can go 15 percent out of your comfort zone, as Elena did, but you can’t force the other person to do the same. “Hey, I opened up to you, so now you have to open up to me, too!” might have worked during childhood games of truth or dare, but it’s not exactly the stuff of exceptional relationships.

This chapter isn’t about coercion or manipulation. Rather, it’s about the process—which can sometimes be quite slow—of encouraging someone else to open up. Even if you can’t control whether someone will self-disclose, you can smooth the runway. That involves knowing when to disclose more about yourself, when to step back to give the other space, and when to ask the right kinds of questions. It also requires supporting the other in achieving what they want, not what you want for them. Ben struggled to walk that narrow path with his buddy Liam.





Ben and Liam, Part 1


Ben and Liam, both grads of the University of Michigan, struck up a friendship at an alumni event in Chicago shortly after Ben moved there. They were both single and in their thirties, and hung out on a regular basis over the next year. They shared their love of biking and the White Sox, and their recent discovery of some reasonably good ski resorts not too far away. They saw each other on a regular basis and talked a lot about sports and work, even though their fields were quite different. Ben was manager of a Walmart, and Liam worked in finance for a large construction company.

Ben valued his friendship with Liam, and the more they hung out, the more he wanted to deepen it. In addition to their mutual interests, Ben enjoyed their contrasting styles. Ben was a gregarious big-picture thinker, while Liam was more reserved and, maybe because of his finance background, was drawn to facts and figures. Because they approached issues from these two different perspectives, their discussions were fun and interesting. However, one of the consequences of Liam’s style was that he tended not to share much that was personal. Ben wondered what he might do to encourage Liam to share more.

One evening, at one of their favorite breweries, Liam told Ben he wanted his advice about something. “I have this co-worker, Randy, who’s a problem.”

“What’s going on?”

“The main thing is that he takes credit for work he hasn’t done.” Liam went on to describe how they’d done a project together, but Randy had told their manager that he’d done almost all of the work. As he talked, he got more and more agitated.

“That sucks. You really sound worked up.”

“Yes. He’s driving me crazy. He’s really slimy—I don’t trust him at all.” Liam went on to describe how upset he was, especially about Randy’s going around him to talk to their manager.

 “Did your manager believe him?”

“I think so. Randy always sounds so damn convincing. And that isn’t the first time. Why are there people like that? It really pisses me off and I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t confront him because he’d spread rumors about me and ruin my reputation in the office. I’ve seen him do that.”

Ben took it in, then asked, “What about going to your manager and telling him it was a joint project?”

“I’d sound like I was making a big deal out of nothing.”

“Have you talked with some of your colleagues about it?”

“That’s playing Randy’s political game, and I don’t want to do that.”

Ben made a couple more suggestions, and Liam became visibly irritated.

“Look, I’ve thought about this stuff already—this isn’t your usual organization, you know? It’s a macho construction company, and you’re supposed to take care of yourself.” Liam then added, “My guess is this crap never happens to you.”

“Huh? What do you mean?”

“Just that you seem good at all the ‘people’ stuff, you know?”

“Actually, I was just thinking about when I had a colleague like Randy.”

Liam relaxed. “What happened there?”

“It was early in my career at Walmart, and this other manager constantly took credit for my ideas.”

“So what did you do about it?”

“Actually, nothing. I really had no idea what to do. If I confronted this guy, he would just deny it. I knew that some other managers were aware of the situation, but they wouldn’t stick their neck out and say anything. I didn’t know if management knew, but I didn’t want to go to them to complain and sound like I was whining. I felt caught in a no-win situation. I couldn’t speak up and had no idea what would happen if I didn’t.”

“So what happened?”

 “I was lucky. As it turned out, I got promoted and he didn’t.”

“You make it sound so easy.”

“It wasn’t. It drove me crazy. It was really stressful, and I felt pretty crappy about myself—I felt helpless. I hated that.”

“Well, that won’t work for me. I don’t have your patience, and Randy bugs the hell out of me.”

Ben was quiet for a minute, then said, “I get that you’re annoyed, and it’s a tough situation. But why is this bending you out of shape so much? In my case, a promotion hung on the outcome, but when you described this project last month, it didn’t seem like a major one—not one that could really affect your career. What Randy’s doing isn’t fair, but what’s so upsetting about it?”

“I’m not sure,” Liam said. “I guess I just don’t like messy interpersonal issues. I went into finance because numbers are objective. You might be able to handle those people problems, but they drive me crazy—I could never do your job. And I hate having to play office politics, which is what Randy does. I just hate it that people get ahead by doing that.”

Ben’s curiosity was piqued. “Yeah? Keep going.”

Liam was quiet for a minute, shook his head ever so slightly, and then glanced up at the TV screen, saying, “Look, the White Sox are tied five-five. Let’s grab another beer and watch the game.”

Ben was once again taken aback by the abrupt change in the conversation but decided to let it go as they went up to the bar. He had noticed Liam do this at various times, but as he’d done before, Ben dropped it.





Encouraging Disclosure


Some of Ben’s actions helped Liam share more, and others were less successful.

Ben’s indication of interest in Liam’s predicament and his empathy with Liam’s frustration were both encouraging. Empathy is the act of conveying not only that you understand the other’s feelings but also that you can identify with them: You can “walk in their shoes,” as the phrase goes. It’s important to note that you don’t have to have been in the exact same situation as someone in order to feel empathy for them. For example, you can empathize with someone’s feeling of sadness because you have felt sadness before, even if the situation they’re describing would not necessarily make you sad. We often have students say, “I have no idea why he’s so angry about this.” To which we reply, “That’s not the point. The point is that you know what anger feels like, so you can still empathize.”

 Empathy is different from sympathy, even though they’re often used interchangeably. Sympathy involves acknowledging someone is in pain and providing comfort or support; it does not necessarily involve identifying with how they are feeling. Sympathy is also often linked with pity, which makes many people feel even smaller. Sympathy, unlike empathy, doesn’t encourage more disclosure from the other. In fact, sometimes it can have the opposite effect, given that many people don’t like it when someone else “feels sorry” for them.

While Ben initially did a nice job on the empathy front, he asked a series of questions that were not useful because they were actually advice. When he did so, Liam closed down. It was when Ben made himself somewhat vulnerable in disclosing his past feelings of helplessness that Liam opened up a bit more. But then Ben pressed for more disclosure, and that may have led to Liam’s abruptly changing the subject.

You’ll undoubtedly have interactions like this one, where you want to learn more, but the other is reticent. As important as showing interest and your self-disclosure are, that might only go so far. You have other options. At times like this, you first have to meet the other person where they are. Only then can both of you move into other, perhaps deeper, areas.

“Meeting someone where they are” has several dimensions. One is, Are you speaking to what they want as opposed to what you want? Another is, Are you responding at the same emotional level? Ben addressed these dimensions when empathizing about Randy’s annoying behavior (“That sucks. You really sound upset”). Liam would not have met him if he’d made a flippant remark or gone deeper than Liam wanted, as he did later. A third dimension is, Are you seeing the world as they see it? Ben failed at that when he didn’t take Liam’s organizational culture into account and made suggestions that could work at Walmart but not in Liam’s company. A fourth dimension is, Are you not responding to what the other really wants? Liam wanted to vent about Randy and his company’s political climate, while Ben was curious about what personal issues were triggered for Liam.

 For the other person to hear anything you have to say, much less tell you more about themselves, they have to know that you seek to understand them and their position. Once that connection is made, then it is possible to bring up other issues and delve into more questions. Ben realized that at the end of their conversation, before they went up to the bar. Even though he wanted to pursue the discussion further, he realized that wasn’t where Liam was. Timing is yet another dimension of meeting somebody else where they are. Ben filed this incident away. Not everything has to be dealt with immediately.





Curiosity, Questions, and Advice


Being curious is a lot more complicated than it seems. At one end of the continuum, you truly don’t understand something at all, and at the other end, you think you know all about it and are just asking questions to test your hypothesis. A problem with the latter is that you’re probably not genuinely curious. You’ve largely made up your mind and are “leading the witness” to prove your case. That stance is unlikely to encourage the other to be more open and revealing.

The best way to make sure your curiosity is authentic is to hold the mindset that, in spite of how perceptive you think you might be and how well you think you know another person, you don’t actually know what’s going on for them. That keeps you naïve in the best sense of the word. And with this naïve curiosity, you are more likely to use questions that encourage disclosure.

 Not all questions are created equal, and asking the right kind can help encourage someone to share. Open-ended questions widen the scope of the conversation by generating options, new perspectives, or new ways of thinking about a situation. Ben did that when he asked Liam to explain what was going on at work and what bothered him so much about the situation.

The most effective open-ended questions don’t begin with the word “why.” “Why” questions tend to drive people into their heads and out of their feelings. Such questions carry an implicit request that the other person justify themselves. For example, if Ben had asked, “Why are you so worked up?” Liam would have felt the need to come up with a logical explanation. If Ben had continued, “Why don’t you just forget about Randy?” it’s unlikely that Liam would have revealed his personal antipathy to office politics and desire for an objective world. Often there’s more going on than can be revealed by a logical explanation.

Closed-ended questions, which usually can be answered with “yes” or “no,” narrow the conversation and are more likely to be felt as intrusive and judgmental. An example is when Ben asked Liam, “Have you talked with some of your colleagues about it?” Equally unproductive are “pseudo-questions” that are really statements in question form. If Ben had asked, “Aren’t you irritated with Randy because you envy his persuasive skills?” that would have been a pseudo-question. Both closed-ended questions and pseudo-questions sound a whole lot like advice or hypothesis testing in question form. Advice is rarely useful, as Ben found, even if the other person asks for it. Our eagerness to help often causes us to jump in with a solution that comes out of our own experience or doesn’t fit the situation. Rarely do we come up with an option the other person hasn’t already considered (and likely discarded). These were all traps that Ben fell into.

 Giving advice can also increase the power discrepancy between two people. The person with an issue might feel one-down to start with, and if the other person acts as though they have the answer, that can exacerbate the gap. Another problem with advice-giving is that it’s easy to misunderstand what the other really wants. Liam may have said he wanted Ben’s advice, but did he really? People go to others for many reasons. Perhaps they want a chance to think out loud. Perhaps they simply want to vent and seek a sympathetic ear. Sometimes they just want support and empathy about an unfair situation, rather than help figuring out a solution. The listener needs to be clear about what the other person wants before they can fully understand how to be most helpful.

David experienced this some time ago when Jim, a colleague, walked into his office. “David, I don’t know what to do with this problem and I’d like your advice.” David eagerly gave Jim his full attention, because he really likes to help and he thought if his ideas were useful, they’d both feel good. Jim continued, “I see two alternatives and am not sure which one to take. I could do A, which has these advantages, but it has these problems. On the other hand, B is attractive for these reasons, but I have some concerns.”

As Jim went on exploring both options in greater depth, David paid close attention, trying to figure out the right answer. As Jim continued his exploration, it seemed to David that option A would be the preferred outcome. He wanted to share his reasoning, believing it would help, but he bit his tongue and waited for Jim to finish. Then Jim got up and went to the door. “Yes, it’s clear that B is the better alternative. Thanks a lot. This was very helpful.” David felt let down and wanted to say, “Wait, you haven’t heard my thoughts!” But he ruefully had to admit that his analysis wouldn’t have helped. Instead, Jim just needed the space to figure it out himself.

This story speaks to another limitation of advice-giving. David’s solution may actually have been right—for David. But it could have been wrong for Jim. Everyone has their own objectives and ways to achieve them. When people give advice, they tend to respond in terms of what they would do rather than fully taking into account how the other best operates.

 Another knock on advice-giving: It can keep you from discovering what is really going on for the other person. In Liam’s case, was it really Randy’s taking credit for the project that made him so upset? Or was it that the office is highly political? Or was it Liam’s (perhaps unrealistic) wish that the world be objective and rational? Our desire to help can lead us to prematurely jump in before we discover the real issue. There is wisdom to the adage “It’s better to have the wrong solution to the right problem than the right solution to the wrong problem”—because you will discover it’s the wrong solution much sooner.

If advice is so often useless, why do people continue offering it? Perhaps because another’s issues seem so much easier to solve than our own. Perhaps because we want the chance to exhibit our analytical skills. Or perhaps we want to be the Lone Ranger who rides into the distressed town, resolves the issue to the townsfolk’s adoration, and then rides away after leaving the silver bullet! Whatever the reason, ask yourself, “Am I giving advice to meet my needs or because I really want to help?”

In spite of all the reasons advice can be problematic, there are times when it works. But that requires certain conditions. If you are going to provide someone with advice, you have to understand the situation fully, really know what the other wants, and take their style and approach into account. Most important, you have to set aside what you would do. All of that is easier said than done. Furthermore, advice-giving doesn’t necessarily contribute much to knowing the other person, other than learning their response to your suggestions.

In helping another be more known, you might want to look for opportunities to support them in more fully expressing their emotions. How do you know if they have understated their feelings? In a sense, you don’t, but you can make a guess based on their tone, their nonverbal cues, and noticing when the intensity of the situation doesn’t match the feelings being expressed. Ben picked up on Liam’s agitation. Ben empathized by saying, “You really sound upset,” which encouraged Liam to more fully express the depth of his anger.

 Unfortunately, rather than continuing to listen for and reflect back Liam’s feelings, which might have encouraged more self-disclosure, Ben did the opposite. He asked a series of logical questions that pulled Liam out of his feelings and into rational responses that he didn’t find helpful.

There’s a fine line between reflecting back unstated or understated emotions and asking leading questions. Case in point: “You say you are slightly bothered, but it doesn’t sound like it. Are you more upset than that?” could be either. The difference is in the assumptions you make and your corresponding tone. If you accept that you never really know what is going on for another person, then you know you are making a guess. Your supposition is just that—a supposition. Not only is a question more accurate than a statement, but it creates less resistance than if you expressed the same idea as if you know. You can also make comments like, “That really sounds upsetting,” or “I would certainly be really annoyed if that happened to me,” because those reflect what is going on within you, which is what you do know. Those empathetic statements are likely to encourage the other to express their feelings more fully.





Ben and Liam, Part 2


A few weeks later, Liam and Ben met for dinner. Ben wanted to ask what had happened with Randy, but before he could say anything, Liam started with, “I’ve put the issue to rest with Randy—thanks for your help.” He added, “Oh, and hey, I’m thinking of applying for a new opportunity in the finance department. It would come with a nice raise, but there are some personnel issues I want your reaction to since that’s more your area.” They got into a detailed conversation, with Ben asking exploratory questions and letting Liam take it in the direction he wanted. The issue was complex, and Ben was getting more and more intrigued. Liam appeared to be getting value from their discussion until, practically in the middle of a sentence, he abruptly changed the subject.

 Wonder why he does that, Ben thought. It’s like a pattern with him. Should I ask him? But he decided against it.

They continued eating, and their conversation turned to whether skiing was in the cards given the lack of snow. Ben was distracted and finding it hard to stay engaged. He was preoccupied by Liam’s abrupt changing of topics and decided to go back to it.

Gingerly he asked, “Liam, I want to go back to something that happened a bit ago when we were talking about that new job and you changed the subject in the middle of the conversation. I’m puzzled. I’ve seen you do that a few times over multiple conversations and wonder what that’s about.”

“I was done talking about it,” Liam responded rather curtly.

Ben, sensing that Liam didn’t want to discuss it, just shrugged and said, “Okay.”

Their conversation shifted to whether the new White Sox closing pitcher was going to make much of a difference to the abysmal season and whether they should bike a new route that weekend.

As their evening unfolded, Ben couldn’t help but think, I could be having this discussion with anyone. But Liam is so thoughtful and interesting. I wish I knew him a little better. He decided to try again.

“Liam, I feel stuck. I wish we could talk about stuff beyond sports and superficial business things because I like friendships with a little more depth. But every time I try to find out more about what’s going on, you close the conversation off. You did it when we were talking about Randy a few weeks ago, and you did it again earlier with the potential new job. What’s up with that? It’s kind of weird.”

Liam’s response took Ben aback. “Every time we get into a conversation that involves anything vaguely personal, you start with the questions—pushing for more and more. It’s like I give an inch and you want a mile. I just don’t like feeling forced.”

 “Why is it so hard for you to share more?” replied Ben. Then, “Oh damn, I think I just did it again! Never mind!”

“Nice catch,” said Liam with a smile. “I don’t feel like going into it.”

“Fair enough. I know I can be pretty intense and push too hard too quickly. I’ve heard that before, so you’re not alone.”

“Thanks,” said Liam. “Let’s get back to planning a bike route.”

Their conversation took on a lighter and easier tone and continued for a while longer.

As they pulled up their calendars to coordinate plans, Liam said, “I’ve been thinking more about what you asked me a while ago. I didn’t mean to be rude; it’s complicated. I’ve always been a pretty private person. The first time I ever really opened up, I was dating a girl in college who kept getting me to share more and then used it against me. It sucked.”

“Ugh,” responded Ben. “Sounds rough. Really helps me understand a little more. And look, I don’t want to push for more than you want to share. I’ll do my best not to bludgeon you with questions even when I want to know more. I’ll let you take the lead.”

Liam nodded appreciatively.

“But I also don’t want to be constantly second-guessing myself. If you start to feel I’m asking too much, tell me and I’ll back off.”

“Will do,” said Liam. Then he added, “And hey, I’ll try to be a little more open.”



* * *



—

In this second conversation, each took risks and those paid off, deepening the level of closeness in their friendship. If Ben had said nothing about Liam’s switching subjects or had backed away (both common responses), the relationship would have remained at a more superficial level. Ben made himself vulnerable by telling Liam more about what he hoped for in their friendship. He also was vulnerable in acknowledging his tendency to push too hard and too fast. He paved the way for Liam to respond with his own disclosure. The way in which Ben “caught” himself, followed by Liam’s pledge to help him see when he was pushing too much, bodes well. They took some important steps, though they will need repeated iterations, with reciprocal risk-taking and vulnerability, for the relationship to continue to grow. But they learned how to disclose to each other and began to experience some of the benefits.

 The difference between being curious and being intrusive can be a very fine line. If you believe someone really wants to get to know you and has told you why, you’re likely to experience their questions as less invasive. If, on the other hand, you sense they see you as an interesting specimen to examine under a microscope, you’ll be far less open. Even more so if you have no idea what they’re going to do with what they learn.

Still, even if Ben had the best of intentions, they may have been lost on Liam. It is important to give the other person space, as Ben did in both conversations. He was careful to express genuine interest without being coercive, letting Liam take the lead. In being sensitive to Liam’s needs without totally ignoring his own, Ben made it easier for Liam in walking that fine line and was successful, even if he did not do everything perfectly.





Self-Disclosure: Who Goes First?


Reciprocity is a crucial element in self-disclosure, but whose job is it to disclose first? Even though the more we disclose, the more control we have over how we are seen, we have to consider how much more difficult it is when issues of status or perceived status are in play. “Status” might be a level in the organization, degree of past achievement, or education. Unfortunately, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background also create status distinctions. Expecting someone who might already feel one-down to initiate self-disclosure is a lot to ask. It’s only logical that such disclosures come with a relatively higher feeling of risk. This is especially the case with people from marginalized groups, such as women in male-dominated fields and people of color.

 Yet higher-status people are often unaware that their role makes it hard for people to disclose to them. Bosses frequently say to their direct reports, “I expect you to speak up,” downplaying the risk of doing so. Those in a higher-power-and-status position need to not only be aware of this dynamic but also disclose to a greater degree than they would with someone of equal status.

When Carole started teaching at Stanford, for instance, she developed a friendly relationship with a senior professor in the organizational behavior department. Periodically they had lunch and found they very much enjoyed having intellectual debates as well as comparing notes about teaching MBAs. Though she enjoyed his company, he was not someone with whom she would have ordinarily been vulnerable, especially given the power differential between them—he was a full professor, while she was a lecturer.

One day, he invited her to lunch and told her he wanted her counsel because she had a reputation for engaging students deeply. What could he do to achieve similar results? To say she was flattered is an understatement, given his stature at the university. More important than the flattery, though, was the underlying vulnerability he demonstrated in asking for her input. Professors rarely admit that they do not have all the answers or that they need help, so this was a significant self-disclosure. Carole naturally offered all the ideas she could, many of which he implemented, and for which he always gave her credit.

While Carole was immensely flattered by his request, it also changed their relationship. His willingness to be vulnerable made her much more open to being vulnerable with him. In subsequent years, she asked him for advice, too. She also shared her professional challenges and deepest disappointments. They became and remain confidants and friends.

Although there was a significant status difference between Carole and her professor friend, she did not report to him. But could a boss be that open with their direct report? We saw that play itself out with a senior executive we worked with. John was a president of the Canadian division of a Fortune 500 company, in which he had built a culture where people could be open and direct with one another. One day, Darryl, his vice president for IT, walked into his office and said, “I just need to tell you that I’m having a hard time performing up to standard. I’m going through a very difficult divorce.”

 John had gone through a divorce himself and, sensing that Darryl might want to talk, said, “Let’s get out of the office for a while. I have to buy new speakers and could use your expertise. We can get some lunch while we’re at it.” John used the time to let Darryl talk about the problems in his marriage and shared some of his own experience. Darryl later reported how much this meant to him, that he felt understood and supported and came to think of John as much more than just his boss.

Many managers would not have done what John did with Darryl out of concern that they would later have to excuse their employee’s poor performance and the organization would suffer. That didn’t occur in this case. In fact, Darryl felt more committed to both John and the organization, and when other members of the executive team learned of what John had done, they, too, felt more loyalty to their executive, and they pitched in to support Darryl through his transition. But if John hadn’t initially built a culture of openness, he might never have known why Darryl’s performance was slipping.





Do You Really Want to Know the Other Fully?


We’ve made a presumption here that people want to get to know others more deeply. Maybe you have some ambivalence. Do you really want to hear about all of someone’s childhood traumas or the difficulties they’re having with their partner? What about the obligations that come with more knowledge? Do you need to comply with their request or always agree with that person and take their side? Is their definition of an exceptional relationship that you’re always available?

 A good friend of ours, Annie, faced this issue with her friend Paula. The two had been friends for ages.

Then Paula developed an illness that required twice-weekly visits to the doctor. Her condition made it difficult for her to drive, so she asked Annie to take her. Annie was more than willing at first, but as the weeks went on, she started to grow resentful—not just of Paula but also of Paula’s son and daughter-in-law. Even though they lived with Paula, the son and his wife begged off chauffeuring, claiming it was because of work and childcare demands.

Annie didn’t know what to do. She was afraid that if she raised the issue directly with Paula, her resentment of the son and daughter-in-law (and growing resentment of Paula, for allowing them to beg off responsibility) would surface and damage the relationship. Instead, she found an excuse to cut down on her driving obligations. This did not hurt her relationship with Paula, but it did nothing to deepen it.

There can be other reasons why a person in Annie’s position might not want to share her feelings. Perhaps she doesn’t want to know more about what’s going on between Paula and her son and daughter-in-law—what if there are real problems there and Paula decides to use their car rides as pseudo therapy sessions? At that point, it would be much more difficult for Annie to tell Paula that she didn’t want that role.

We’ve spent most of these last two chapters telling you about the benefits of increased self-disclosure, but Annie’s situation shows us that it can also lead to tricky or awkward situations. As relationships develop, people come to have growing expectations of each other. And while reaching out and responding to the other’s needs is an essential part of building a stronger relationship, setting boundaries is also crucial. Different boundaries might be needed at different points in a developing relationship. You have to identify, surface, and successfully resolve these boundary concerns when they arise. Easy, right? Fear not, we’ll get back to this in later chapters.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Ben’s position. You would like to build a more personal relationship with Liam. You like him and value his analytical skills but wish he would be more self-revealing. You have an easy time with your own self-disclosure and wish that Liam would do more disclosing himself. What could you do to encourage that?

 Thinking of the various situations described in this chapter, what do you think you might have done? Any ways that you think you might have limited your effectiveness?



What does this say about your abilities (and style) in helping others become more self-disclosing?





Choose one of the key relationships you identified previously. Which of the following behaviors do you engage in that make it easier for the other to be more fully known?

 Listening actively to try to fully understand them



Suspending judgment and not trying to quickly figure out what’s going on with them



Being curious and inquiring about what is important to them



Using open-ended questions to encourage them to share more



Listening for emotions and helping their full expression (for instance, “You sound more than a little annoyed; what are you feeling?”)



Empathizing—especially with feelings (“That really sounds upsetting”)



Showing acceptance (“I can really understand why you would react that way”)





Conversely, do you have a tendency to do any of the following, which discourage the other to share and be more fully known?

 Only half listen because you are thinking about (or have already decided) how to respond



Change the conversation rather quickly to talk about yourself or things that interest you



Think you have figured out what is really going on for them



Ask leading questions to make sure they accept your conclusions



Ignore their feelings and use logic to make your case



Make judgments about their comments or actions



Don’t empathize with their situation





Why do you tend to respond in these ways?





APPLICATION


The questions you answered in the previous section reflect how you perceive yourself. Does the other person in the relationship see you the same way? Go to them and ask what you do that supports or limits their willingness to self-disclose.

Remind them you’re raising the issue because you want a more open relationship. You are leading with your self-disclosure to encourage theirs and, by doing so, deepening the relationship. That’s what will make this a personal activity, not an academic one.





MAKING SENSE


If you completed the application exercise, you learned the extent to which the other’s perception matched yours. But how easy was it to hear their view, especially if there was a mismatch with yours?

Think of the other key relationships you identified. What can you now do to encourage those people to be better known?

There’s a dilemma inherent in this process. You’re trying to learn new behaviors while building relationships—but you don’t want the other person in the relationship to feel as if they are being used or serving as a subject in your experiment. What have you learned about how to walk that line? By the way, have you checked in with them about how they are feeling about this?
