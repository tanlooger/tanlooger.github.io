title: 8 CHALLENGES IN USING FEEDBACK EFFECTIVELY
---






If only everyone responded to feedback like Sanjay did. Sure, some people work out difficulties smoothly, but life isn’t always that easy. Disputes get messy as people react with defensiveness, denial, resistance, and retaliation. Even when things do work out, reaching a resolution can be difficult and painful.

Perhaps that’s why instead of taking the direct road of the feedback model, people often veer off course toward avoidance or careen into heightened conflict. Instead of acknowledging our strong emotions, we ignore them and revert to logical arguments. Even the best-informed and most well-intentioned people can forget their reality and instead bludgeon the other with accusations. In this chapter, we look at why and what can be done to handle these pitfalls. In the process, we break down problem-solving into different stages to see where you might get stuck.

Although it may be uncomfortable, we encourage you to reflect on what stops you from effectively using feedback. Naturally, since relationships are co-determined, the responsibility isn’t yours alone, but for now we want you to focus on you. This is not to make you the villain, but to emphasize that your actions and your responses are, in the end, the only ones you can control.

First, a disclaimer: The feedback model is not a magic wand. Rarely does one piece of feedback, no matter how well crafted, resolve the issue. Say that you’re upset with a family member because they always seem to find something to criticize. Just saying that you’re upset is unlikely to solve the problem. There are probably many more issues, historic and contemporary, at play in their behavior and in your reactions to it. Most interpersonal issues are complex and layered. Remember, you only know your feelings and your needs. You have only part of the story. Feedback starts a conversation, but it’s just the start.





Blocking Emotions


When feedback conversations don’t go well, we conclude that we were right to see them as dangerous. What we don’t see is that the problem was not in what we raised but in what we didn’t. More often than not, the missing piece is emotions. Emotions are central to the feedback model, so it’s crucial that we not only have access to them but actually express them instead of using one of the following justifications for staying silent.





“I SHOULDN’T FEEL [INSERT EMOTION]”


Are there certain feelings that, almost irrespective of the situation, you think you shouldn’t have? “I shouldn’t feel envious or jealous.” “It’s bad to be angry at somebody.” “I’m really not hurt.” Some of these thoughts may come from parental messages, the values you hold, or the image you want to portray. Or perhaps you’re concerned that if you allow yourself to feel those emotions, they will overwhelm you or you will act on them.

Again, the important distinction is between how you feel and what actions you take. You have little choice about the former, since feelings come up whether you want them or not. But you have much more choice about the latter. If you’re annoyed at your friend Sharon for telling you what to do, you’re annoyed at Sharon. Recognizing that gives you options. You can reflect on why you’re annoyed, and having that insight might be sufficient for the annoyance to significantly diminish. Or you can tell Sharon you’re annoyed—simply stating it might also make the annoyance lessen. Or you might be so upset that you need to fully state the extent of your anger (though without attacking her) the next time she tells you what to do.

 Feelings are never “wrong.” What might be inappropriate is how you express them or what you attribute the cause to.





“I CAN’T JUSTIFY MY FEELINGS IN THIS CONTEXT”


Let’s assume you’re working on a project with a co-worker, and today he seems especially rigid and difficult to influence. You think, I should give him a break since I know he has just been chewed out by his boss, but you continue to feel annoyed—and now are annoyed at yourself because you can’t let it pass.

Whether you understand why someone is behaving the way they are or has a logical explanation isn’t relevant to the legitimacy of your feelings, though it may influence their intensity. You can choose to live with your annoyance or you could say, “I know you’ve had a run-in with your boss, but I am feeling annoyed at how you are responding. What can we do about this?” This is why feedback is usually only the start of a conversation.





“I’M SURE THIS FEELING WILL PASS”


Some feelings do pass, but others may linger. Even if you choose not to raise your annoyance and the feelings dissipate in the next hour, that doesn’t mean they have entirely disappeared. Maybe they are “parked” somewhere and will come alive with even greater force the next time Sharon offers advice. An old TV car-repair ad said, “Pay me now or pay me later,” with the latter being the more expensive repair. Don’t you want to respond to Sharon now, before it gets worse?





“MY FEELINGS CONTRADICT EACH OTHER,” OR [+5] + [−5] = 0


When it comes to emotions, this is poor math! We often have multiple feelings in a particular situation, and they can appear to be in conflict. (Remember, this is also a barrier to sharing feelings, which we talked about in chapter 3.) On the one hand, you’re annoyed with your co-worker because of his controlling behavior, but on the other hand, you appreciate his willingness to work on this project even though he is extremely stressed. The danger is that allowing the positive emotion to cancel out the negative suppresses both feelings and results in your saying nothing or watering down your feedback.

But both feelings are true, so emotional math says [+5] and [−5] do not equal zero; they just equal [+5] and [−5]. Instead of withholding your feelings, express both of them. Doing so results in being better known—through both the emotions themselves and their intensity, because both say something important about you. It might also be that until both emotions are fully expressed, they won’t go away.





“I’M SO MAD I DON’T TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK”


What happens when the other person does something that just makes you furious? You’re so angry that any concern for them has just flown out the window. You think, I am so upset, I don’t give a damn why they did that. I don’t trust myself in what I might say. Could you just say that last sentence and ask for twenty minutes to cool down and then talk about it? That lets the other person know what is going on for you. It might be that just expressing this is enough to lower your temperature. But if not, twenty minutes should be enough. You want the emotion to be manageable—you don’t want it to evaporate or to fester further. This type of emotional regulation and appropriate emotional expression are important elements of emotional intelligence. As Daniel Goleman notes, emotional intelligence begins with self-awareness and the ability to recognize our feelings as they arise. The capacity to manage (not suppress!) our emotions comes next.

 One emotion that is especially difficult to manage well is anger. Most people don’t realize that anger is a secondary emotion. When someone feels too exposed to express certain emotions, such as hurt, rejection, or envy, it often feels safer to express anger. This is especially true of men, who have been socialized not to express vulnerability. The transfer from a more basic, vulnerable feeling to anger can be so automatic that the person who is upset is unaware of the underlying feelings. But expressing anger can lock both parties into rigid, defensive positions.

We’re not suggesting that expressing anger is never appropriate. And we do think it is important to allow ourselves to feel it. In fact, it can be very useful to recognize anger if you can resist moving to blame and accusations and explore what lies underneath it. Your emotions are your emotions, and if you’re feeling angry, you’re feeling angry. It’s what you do with that anger that can be problematic.





Making Up Stories


We have noted our tendencies to make up stories about why someone else is behaving the way they are. As human beings we have a strong need to make sense of our experiences. But when it comes to feedback, few things get us in more trouble than making up stories, especially when we don’t even realize that’s what we’re doing.

When you move from a guess, to a strong hunch, to certainty, you create a story that guarantees curiosity will disappear. That happens whether the story you have made up is a classic example of being over the net (“He just wants to have the last word”) or data selected to fit a negative narrative (“He doesn’t respect me; he’s always looking at his phone when I’m trying to talk to him”). Even if you ask something at that point, it is likely to be a pseudo-question, such as, “Isn’t the reason you always have the last word that…,” which won’t encourage an open discussion.

 Once we make up a story, an attribution is an easy leap. “He just wants to have the last word” quickly turns into “He’s insecure.” “She only likes to talk about herself” becomes “She is self-centered.” Once attributions are made (for which we select confirming data, as previously noted), we often jump to labels. “Self-centered” becomes “narcissistic.” Attributions and labels oversimplify and are dangerously reductionistic, as they create a very specific lens through which we see someone else.

So what to do with this almost automatic inclination? You have several options. One is to reflect on what it is about your friend Susie’s tendency to talk about herself and her latest accomplishments that bothers you. Could it be that you are envious that she does something that is difficult for you to do? Or are you waiting for her to ask you about what is going on in your life? Noticing your thought process is an important place to start (a reminder that much of becoming more interpersonally competent requires mindfulness).

Another option is to leverage our storytelling tendencies to develop a positive explanation. For example, if your initial story about why Susie talks about herself contains a negative motive, you could instead come up with a story that her intent is positive, and that what she is actually trying to do is build a relationship in which you both feel free to share and celebrate your accomplishments. Creating an alternative story might introduce enough uncertainty to drive you back to curiosity.

A third option is to simply name what you’re doing. “Susie, I’m noticing that you often talk a lot about what you do and how well it’s all going. That bothers me and I’m sorry to say that leads me to making up a story about you that you self-promote because you are insecure, which I don’t want to do. It is my story and unfair to you. What is your intent when you tell me about your achievements?” You are acknowledging these are your stories and not an unequivocal truth. But this only works if you can allow for the possibility that your story is wrong.





The Problem-Solving Stages


Let’s presume that you haven’t fallen into any of the traps outlined above but you want to address a troubling, complex problem with many layers. You’ve mentioned it lightly before, but it didn’t appear to have an impact, and the problematic behavior has continued. It’s now starting to become entangled with other issues, and you’re afraid that it could lead to a major conflict. You’ve decided to take the bull by the horns and fully deal with it. How to do this without the exchange getting out of hand?

There are four critical stages when it comes to addressing complex issues. First is getting the other person to take the issue seriously. Second, they have to be willing to fully share what’s going on for them. Third, you want to arrive at a mutually satisfying solution, not just settle for the minimum that will end the discussion. Finally, you need to determine if the relationship is in need of some repair work, because when the discussion has been contentious, it is easy for each person to feel bruised and the relationship to suffer.

Each stage is helped by following the feedback model, and each stage can be sabotaged by violating it. Fortunately, perfection is not required; even temporarily getting off course need not be a disaster if you can catch yourself. Remember, the only mistake is refusing to learn from your mistakes.





STAGE 1: GETTING THE OTHER PERSON TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK SERIOUSLY


People will usually consider your concerns if they see that your intent in doing so is in their best interests. There are a few ways to do this, none of which are mutually exclusive:

“This is how your behavior is affecting me.” This basic approach works when the other person cares about you. For example, “I’m bothered because three times in the meeting you changed the subject while I was still talking.” However, it’s less effective if the other isn’t concerned about your well-being. They might brush you off or, even worse, respond with, “Well, I guess that’s your problem!”



“Your behavior is not meeting your goals.” This assumes that the other has stated their goals: “Hans, you said that you wanted others to speak up, but the way you shut down Simon makes me hesitant to disagree and is likely to get people to hold back.” The other person’s goals could also be self-evident: “When I don’t experience you considering my ideas, I am less open to yours and you lose influence with me.” Even if you don’t have much of a relationship, you get their attention by pointing out how their actions aren’t achieving their objectives.



“You might be meeting your goals, but you’re paying some unnecessary costs.” When another person’s behavior bothers you, ask yourself, “Are they paying a cost as well?” “Leah, I also want efficient meetings, but when we’re rushed, the ideas we come up with aren’t as good.” You are supporting Leah on the primary goal but getting her attention by pointing out these undesirable consequences.



“Am I doing anything that is causing your behavior?” Most interpersonal issues have an interpersonal cause. Acknowledging your part can make it easier for the other to accept theirs. “Kyle, does my tendency to jump in with solutions decrease your willingness to initiate?”

 note: These four variation on the feedback model apply to all relationships as will occur with Maddie and her husband in chapter 12.





STAGE 2: SHARING ALL THE ISSUES


Let’s presume you’re both at the proverbial table, ready and invested in talking. The task now is to explore the issues. “Issues” is plural because frequently the first point raised isn’t the only, or necessarily the most important, area of contention. In the previous chapter, Elena started by sharing one issue: her frustration that her comments in team meetings were not acknowledged. Then as the discussion unfolded, this expanded to also include the fact that Sanjay not only participated in that behavior himself but also didn’t give Elena credit in the executive committee meeting.

Not only can the person initiating the feedback have several issues, but raising them may trigger the other person’s concerns. That’s what happened when Sanjay responded to Elena’s initial feedback by saying, “Well, I’m glad you’re raising this, Elena, because I’ve been bothered as well. I want this group to get along, and you tend to be pretty judgmental.” What started off in Elena’s mind as rather simple grew much more complicated.

Their conversation could have turned into a real mess. Not only were there more issues on the table, but Sanjay’s accusation might have caused Elena to become defensive, leading her to retort, “Well, the reason I had to speak up was because you didn’t do your job.” Sanjay could then respond defensively with a counter-accusation, and they’d be well into the blame game. Neither would be curious, because the objective would be to win. They’d have forgotten behavioral feedback entirely.

When problems are complex and intertwined, things can feel messy. Imagine there’s a muddy swamp, and you need to cross it to get to the high ground on the other side. At first, you carefully look for rocks to step on so as not to get mud on your shoes. But halfway across, the rocks end. You have a choice: “Do I go on and wade through the swamp, or should I turn around?” Turning around ends the discussion, with one person stalking out of the room or, just as dysfunctional, saying, “Let’s just agree to disagree.” The latter might make sense when it comes to politics or large ideological differences, but not in the context of building robust relationships.

 It’s tricky, but it is possible to press on when each side is locked into a defensive position. It can still feel messy, but you can stop the escalation in order to separate out the intertwined issues. If that doesn’t work, you can temporarily set aside the content of the argument to ask, “What’s going on—why are we stuck?” This allows you to process how you got into the swamp in the first place and how you can productively move forward to the dry ground. This won’t work, of course, if it just becomes another arena for mutual blame. Instead, both parties need to look at the specific behaviors that led the discussion off course and then share what feelings came up. This is also a good time to reiterate that your intent in giving the feedback is to help both the other and the relationship. Then you can get back to problem-solving.





STAGE 3: RESOLUTION


Rather than searching for “an answer,” it is important to recognize that there are multiple desired outcomes. First, you want to ensure the discussion has solved the initial problems in a way that satisfies both people. These sorts of problems usually have more than one viable solution. The temptation is to grab the first one that appears out of relief, just to end this difficult conversation. Instead, continue to explore options until you discover a solution that meets the needs of both. This might take time and require multiple conversations.

Second, you want the discussion to improve your problem-solving ability. This may include understanding how you got into this problem in the first place, but it also should examine how you went about resolving it. Were there places you got stuck, or was it more tortuous than necessary? The objective is to increase, not decrease, each person’s willingness to raise difficult issues in the future.

 The third and fourth objectives deal with aspects of the relationship itself. Do you know each other better because in the discussion you’ve shared relevant parts of yourself? Again, that was true with Elena and Sanjay, as Elena talked about her style of interacting and Sanjay admitted his difficulty with conflict. And finally, has your relationship improved as a result of the effort? In Sanjay and Elena’s case, they came to an agreement that both wanted to be as direct as possible with each other going forward.





STAGE 4: REPAIR


Let’s say you’ve achieved those objectives. Well done. Now take stock: You may need to do some repair work on the relationship. The process may not have been an easy one; things might have been said that caused hurt or regret. Has the importance of the relationship to both of you been lost in this process? Has one or both of you felt devalued?

Saying “I’m sorry” is often a critical component of repair, but many people can’t bring themselves to say the phrase. Some see it as “losing face,” while others fear being misinterpreted. For example, the words can be heard as you taking full responsibility for any harm, even when you’re just sorry the two of you are in this situation. Yet saying “I’m sorry” is very powerful. It extends an olive branch that can stop an adversarial exchange in its tracks, help people reconnect after a disagreement, and serve as a form of disclosure that makes you vulnerable and increases the chance of a reciprocal response. A good apology conveys that you truly are sorry (e.g., not “I’m sorry you feel that way,” which can be taken as just a pro forma response). That requires you to actually feel sorry, since most people can fairly easily pick up whether you genuinely mean it.

 Beyond apologies, affirming the other, and the relationship, matters: “Even though we find ourselves in this pickle, I want to be sure you know how much I value you and our relationship.” A genuine expression of empathy is also important to repair: “I’m hearing how hard this conversation has been for you, and I really appreciate your hanging in there.”

And last, check back the next day to see if any of these stages need revisiting. With time for the issue to settle, does it feel as complete as you thought? Are there any lingering issues that got pushed under the rug in the haste to reach resolution? If nothing else, checking in signals concern for the other and the relationship, and that, in itself, is a form of repair.





Dealing with Defensiveness


One of the great benefits of the feedback model is that it can minimize feelings of defensiveness. If the other has stayed on their side of the net, they’re sharing their reaction to your behavior. It is not a judgment of your character. You still can feel somewhat defensive, but you don’t have to see it as a total rejection of who you are.

This speaks to the difference between being defensive and having to defend oneself. If somebody makes an accusation that you think is inaccurate, is it being defensive to correct them? If somebody misunderstands you, is it defensive to explain yourself more accurately? If you are attacked, isn’t it appropriate to defend yourself?

The problem might not be defensiveness but rather its side effects. It can block your ability to hear feedback, or you might too quickly dismiss that feedback with explanations, even if you heard it. When you think the feedback is exaggerated, defensiveness can keep you from exploring what aspects might have some validity. Dismissing feedback as completely wrong results in defensiveness that blocks you from wanting to explore why the other person feels the way they do. So how can you accept your feelings of defensiveness without these limiting consequences?

 Imagine defensiveness as a continuum. At the extreme end, you’re so overwhelmed with emotion that you can no longer hear anything the other person says. (Haven’t we all, at one time or another, experienced that?) In such a flooded state, it may be best to halt the feedback. “Sorry, but I’m so upset, I can’t take any more of this in. I need some time to absorb it, and then we can come back to it.”

But more times than not, when you feel defensive, it’s not that extreme; you can still hear and deal with what someone is telling you. Acknowledge the feeling, and hold back your tendency to rebut. Instead, try to understand what the other is saying. Set aside the need to “be right.” The most important issue at that moment is the feedback that the other is giving—not defending your identity or ego.

What if you give feedback and the other person appears defensive? The same conditions apply. If you see that the other is totally emotionally flooded, you can say, “I’m concerned. If I were in your shoes, I might feel overwhelmed. Is that going on for you? Would it help to take a break and come back to this later?” Again, do come back to it. If it’s having that much impact on the other, it must be important.

More frequently, people respond to feedback in ways that sound defensive. They say, “Wait, I don’t do that all the time,” or “The reason that I do it is because of X and Y.” At that point, the feedback giver’s tendency is to back down (“Oh, it really isn’t such a big deal”) because they assume that the other person is closed to learning. Not only does backing down not solve anything, but the assumption might be wrong. Why not assume their comments are a sign that they’re trying to make sense of the information? They may be struggling to reconcile the feedback with their view of themselves, but they still hear.

 Consider what would happen if they didn’t push back at all. Say you gave a colleague an important piece of feedback and they responded in a very calm and rational voice: “Thank you very much. I’ve never heard that before. I will take that in and change immediately.” Would you really believe them? Wouldn’t it be likely that your feedback went in one ear and out the other?

Try to see the value in their struggle, and don’t back off, but join them. If they say, “Wait a minute, I don’t do that all the time,” you might respond by saying, “That’s right, you don’t, but you did it here and there [naming specific behavioral incidents], and it bothers me/is not meeting your goals/is costly to you.” If it’s an important relationship and the behavior is getting in the way, reiterate that and then be persistent for both your sakes!

Whether you are giving or receiving feedback, defensiveness is often a sign that there is a kernel of truth in the feedback, and therefore something valuable to explore. A therapist friend of ours once said, “Sh*t sticks only if there’s something for it to stick to.” We find that often to be true. If somebody attacks you—even in harsh terms—with something that doesn’t resonate, any defensiveness is short-lived. But if your defensiveness lingers, there’s usually some part of the accusation that is hitting home. It may be something that you don’t like admitting, or you may be concerned it’s blown out of proportion, but it does stick, nonetheless. Recognizing that gives you choices in how to respond. Can you acknowledge the part that feels at least partially true? If you do, you lower your resistance to hearing more of the other’s feedback, and, possibly, to learning something from it.





The Ability to Learn


As mentioned in the beginning of this book, our extensive teaching, coaching, and consulting has shown us that the key determining factor for both relationship development and individual growth is an ability to learn. It’s also instrumental to success at work, regardless of your position. We have seen time and again that not only does a reluctance to learn block success, but the failure to address interpersonal deficiencies (rather than a lack of technical expertise) is career limiting.

 Individual and relational learning are often interlaced, as Sanjay and Elena found. When Elena gave Sanjay feedback about needing to be acknowledged for her contributions to the team, he learned about the negative effect of some of his individual actions. But they also discussed how they wanted to relate to each other. Elena asked whether the way she was giving Sanjay feedback felt like an attack and whether she should not be as direct. Sanjay’s saying that was not the case freed up their interactions.

Receiving feedback from another, as Sanjay did, furthers your development, since you learn what you do well and what you can do better. So why would anyone resist hearing it? Some of that is because of mental models, like the belief that the giver’s intention isn’t to help but to put you down (and make themselves look better). Maybe the person who gave the feedback did it in such a disconfirming way that it was difficult to hear. Perhaps it was over the net or judgmental. You still may learn, but it may not make you eager to solicit feedback from them in the future.

Consider, too, whether there’s something in you that blocks your learning. Do you need to hold on to a certain image, and does accepting feedback threaten that image? Or does accepting feedback mean admitting failure or inadequacy? We sometimes hear, “I love to learn; I just don’t want anybody to know that I’m learning.” It’s tempting, we know, to hold on to an image of infallibility, but that can be quite costly.

Accepting the validity of someone’s feedback also doesn’t mean you must act on it. Feedback is information for you to decide what to do with. It’s data with which to expand your choices. As a colleague of ours says, “It’s like clothes—try it on and see if it fits.” It might be that someone suggests you change some significant assumptions and behaviors, like your tendency to avoid conflict. But you’re afraid that if you really take that in, you’ll say things that you later regret.

 One option is to start off small and consider experimenting with people and in settings where you feel relatively safe. So, for example, if you are working on being more direct and less conflict avoidant, you might want to try applying this with a close friend. Your friend has a tendency to cancel plans at the last minute, and that bugs you. When raising this with him, you might include telling him that you are working on being more direct. That is likely to be within the 15 percent outside your comfort zone and therefore a good place to start. In stark contrast would be going to your boss and telling her that the way she keeps changing priorities is driving you nuts.

We have repeatedly said feedback is a gift—but just because someone gives you a gift, it doesn’t mean you’re required to use it. This may not be the best time to take action. Seeing feedback as data that informs and expands our choices—not a requirement for change—makes it easier to hear and consider.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Discounting Feelings: Do you have a tendency to discount your emotions in any of these ways?

 “I shouldn’t feel certain emotions.”



“I can’t justify my feelings in this context.”



“I’m sure this feeling will pass.”



“My feelings contradict each other.” ([+5] + [−5] = 0)



“I’m so mad that I don’t trust myself to speak.”





Are there other ways you block recognizing and/or expressing feelings? If so, where do these tendencies come from?



Making Up Stories: Do you have a tendency to make up stories about others’ reality? Or to move from a hunch to certainty? Under what circumstances is that more likely to occur?



Four Stages of Problem-Solving: What might you do at these four stages that hinders effective problem resolution?

 Getting the other person to take the feedback seriously



Sharing all the issues



Resolution



Repair





Defensiveness:

 Your defensiveness: How frequently do you get defensive? What situations tend to trigger that? And how do you handle it when you feel that way?



Other’s defensiveness: How do you respond when the other person gets defensive?





APPLICATION


In the self-reflection section, you indicated how you see yourself behaving. But how might another see you? Go to one of your key relationships and check some of your perceptions out with them.

Hopefully, the self-reflection section and/or discussions with others have generated several development areas for you to explore. For example, “I want to be more open to feedback and less defensive.”

Select one or two areas that you would like to work on and set some change goals. Change is easier and more likely if you have somebody supporting you. Go to one of your relationships and ask them to help you reach your learning goals.





MAKING SENSE


On the basis of what you read, reflected on, and tried out, what did you learn about challenges in using feedback effectively? And what did you learn about yourself?

What do you want to do going forward based on what you’re learning? Note that by now you are building a toolkit that can come in handy anytime with any relationship, not only with the key people you identified at the start. The more you practice with others and then extract lessons from that “doing,” the more you will learn.
