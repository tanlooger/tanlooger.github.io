title: 17 AN EXCEPTIONAL RELATIONSHIP GONE AWRY—AND BACK AGAIN
---






The two of us have had a long and close relationship. We first met at Stanford over twenty years ago, when David ran the Interpersonal Dynamics course as well as the training for its facilitators. Carole went through the training and eventually joined the other faculty in teaching the course. We quickly developed a close mentoring relationship and moved along the continuum to exceptional.

We tended to agree on general goals but came at issues in slightly different ways, producing better solutions than either of us would have achieved alone. We were able to raise and resolve disagreements easily, resulting in a great working relationship. Our friendship deepened, and we used each other as a resource for personal and professional problems. We believed we knew each other very well given our high degree of mutual openness and great trust. Furthermore, we both lived much of what we have discussed in this book—mutual self-disclosure, giving and receiving both affirming and developmental feedback, resolving pinches, and jointly solving major problems.

Then an incident occurred that neither of us saw coming and that nearly ended our high-trust, caring relationship. Our issues became deeply entangled, and we had to know which strand to pull to unravel the knot—we did so with the help of a third party and by using the competencies in this book. It was a close call, though, and goes to show just how difficult the work of building exceptional relationships is—even among its most fervent teachers.

The specifics of the disagreement itself boiled down to a scenario that will sound familiar, if not universal (and we’ve changed the details, in any case!): Carole asked for something from her employer that she didn’t get and learned that David hadn’t gone to bat for her.

From David’s perspective:

I had been coordinating the Interpersonal Dynamics faculty for many years and was getting ready to step down. Touchy-Feely had been the pinnacle of my professional career at Stanford and was now my legacy there. I had been grooming Carole for over a decade and was impressed with how her Stanford career had blossomed. She had taken on more and more responsibilities, throwing herself into the work. She taught multiple sections of the Interpersonal Dynamics course, developed several new courses in both the MBA and executive programs, and overhauled what became the school’s signature, the Leadership Fellows Program. In spite of the courses’ and programs’ successes, there was little recognition from management for her contributions. But I highly valued her and believed she was my obvious replacement.

She indicated a willingness to be my successor, and I was confident that I’d be leaving the course in excellent hands. That was reassuring since I was in the middle of a budget fight. The business school was facing financial constraints and was cutting course support. Interpersonal Dynamics was already, by far, the most expensive course taught, and I was afraid some necessary funding would be taken away. Saving that was my highest priority.



From Carole’s perspective:

When David announced he was going to step down and conversations began about my taking over his responsibilities, I asked management that Interpersonal Dynamics be given the designation of “program,” not “course.” The specifics of why this mattered so much are complex, but in a nutshell, programs were given more infrastructure support, in part because they were recognized as being complicated to run, which Interpersonal Dynamics undeniably was. With the designation of “program,” I’d also be eligible for a director title, which I believed would give me more credibility with the faculty and administration.

I feared that, unlike David, who had been in that role for decades, I needed these two conditions to be as effective as he had been. Without them I wouldn’t be able to honor his legacy as fully as I wanted. We also worked in a highly male-dominated arena, and as a woman, I felt disadvantaged. Having experienced discrimination for years in the private sector, I had hoped academia would be different, only to find out it was just as bad. I was counting on David, my mentor, to help me make this happen.

I went to management to make my case, but they turned down my two requests. I was furious. I had given everything I had to the school, and though I was appreciated by my students, I rarely felt appreciated or acknowledged by management for my contributions. Instead, I was consistently asked to do more. I had long believed that being a “good soldier” in service of the system would eventually pay off but was growing dubious that would be the case. I never had asked for much for myself before, and now, when I wanted something that I believed was essential for the course’s success, they were unwilling to grant my request. The result was that I was growing increasingly resentful. I no longer believed “good things come to those who wait.” I told management that unless Interpersonal Dynamics was categorized a program and they announced that I was officially running it, I wouldn’t do it. I went to David to ask for his support.





The First Conversation


After pleasantries, Carole explained what she wanted from David. He replied, “Carole, why are you pushing so hard for the program and title? I just don’t get what’s the big deal.”

“The big deal is that I’m going to have to fight the very battles you are fighting right now. Without the recognition I’m asking for, I don’t think I’ll be successful.”

David thought for a moment, then said, “I don’t think that’s true; you have built a strong reputation for all that you’ve done. Management recognizes that, and the Interpersonal Dynamics faculty is behind you.”

Carole argued back, “The course is at a critical juncture in its evolution. Running it has become extremely complex, given its many moving parts. It’s also much more interdependent with people and departments throughout the school than any other course. It’s reached a point where it needs to be acknowledged as a program. And I need the credibility in order to lead it well.”

David assured Carole he would still be around and happy to help. He also reiterated how much confidence he had in her.

“I need more than that,” Carole said. “I want you to go fight for me and ask management to give me what I’ve asked for. There is no way I am going to succeed in this system as you have if you don’t, especially as a woman, and one who isn’t tenured, at that!”

“Sorry, Carole,” David said. “Given how well you have done in the past in building the program, I don’t think you need this. Furthermore, I have to use all of my credit on saving our budget. If they cut that, as they are considering, that will have a significant negative impact on the course and put you in a bind. I have to put everything into that fight right now and don’t want to jeopardize the outcome.”

 Carole said, “But why can’t you tell them how crucial both of these things are for the future of the course?”

David agreed that he’d raise the request and support it but said that he wouldn’t fight for it. “That’s all I’m willing to do.”

Carole left feeling angry and misunderstood. How does he not recognize why this is so important to me and the ongoing success of his life’s work?

David felt annoyed. Why can’t she see that she can succeed without those labels? And why can’t she accept that she will never get appropriate recognition? I never did and learned to live with that. I figured out how to run Interpersonal Dynamics without a program designation—she can, too.

To put it mildly, the conversation had gone nowhere. And from there things got even worse.

At David’s next budget meeting with management, he made the case for Carole’s requests. He was asked whether they were crucial for her to lead the other faculty. David hesitated for a moment. “Well, not getting these things certainly makes her job harder, but she can do it,” he said. He added that the real challenge was her legitimacy and influence with management. They assured him that was not an issue. David then asked why the program designation and title were such a problem for them, and they said that they were totally consumed with the financial issues and that had to be their first priority. They also wanted to conduct a full and thoughtful review of programs and titles after the crisis was over and were very reluctant to make a one-off decision at that time. David then let it go.

When David told Carole what had happened at the meeting with management, and that he had chosen not to push further, even knowing how much this meant to her, she was furious and deeply hurt.

 “This is a real slap in the face, David,” she said. “What’s the point in busting my ass the way I have if, when the chips are down, it doesn’t matter?” He responded that her work had mattered and she was underestimating the influence she had built. She then reiterated the damage she feared this would do to the Interpersonal Dynamics course in the long run and added: “If the situation had been reversed, I would have gone to bat for you in an instant, even if as a man you might not need the support as much as I do.”

“Carole, I wouldn’t want that. Why would you do that?”

“I would want to do right by you,” she said, “because of all you’ve done for the school. And I expect you to do the same. I can’t believe you don’t think doing right by me is doing right by the organization. And I just can’t believe you’re doing this, after all I have done for you and your Interpersonal Dynamics ‘baby.’ ”

“You’ve done a lot for the school and for the course, and I—and others—very much appreciate you for that,” David said. “But I don’t agree that any of that should factor into what is ultimately best for the course. This budget issue is crucial, and I think it is important to respect their process when it comes to program and title designations. Furthermore, I wouldn’t want anyone to think I was advocating on your behalf because of our friendship—that wouldn’t be fair to you.”

At that point, our discussion ended.

Carole’s perspective:

In that moment, David represented the entire institution and all the ways in which I had felt expendable and marginalized for years. I thought, If I can’t count on him to see the injustice and show me appreciation by doing right by me, I can’t count on anybody.

I completely wrote him off. I wasn’t sure I’d ever be able to trust him again. I thought our worldviews were just too different. I have a very high value around loyalty, and it seemed clear he didn’t—or that he defined it differently. I thought our differences were irreconcilable. I wanted nothing to do with him…ever again.



David’s perspective:

At this point, I felt helpless. I felt written off, which was painful, but I didn’t know what to say. We had gone around and around with the same arguments. I hoped with the passage of time that Carole’s anger would somewhat dissipate and we could reconnect.



Even though our relationship was severely strained, we still had to work together for the rest of the year. We barely exchanged a word outside of what was necessary. Staff meetings were as short as possible, and our interactions were down to a minimum. While we were polite and able to work together as professionals, we did not go to each other for advice or to talk about issues, much less banter as we once had.

A critical element of the Touchy-Feely course is learning to repair, and several colleagues pushed Carole to live what she taught and meet with David. Carole felt so wronged, so hurt, and so betrayed that she refused. She continued to believe that if the situation had been reversed, she would have fully supported David. She wanted nothing to do with him. David, knowing this, didn’t know what to do.





Repair Begins


Months later, Carole was encouraged to try a repair. Her negative feelings were still strong, but she was also feeling the loss of the relationship. She reached out to David and asked him to meet with her in her office to see if there was anything to be done to salvage it.

 David leapt at the invitation since he hadn’t seen any other way to connect. He didn’t know what new might be said, but he was hopeful.

After a cool and somewhat awkward greeting, Carole told David she hoped they could have a real repair conversation. David expressed the same wish. At first, the conversation seemed a repeat of the first, to little avail.

But then David expressed that he was puzzled that Carole was so upset, and she was incredulous that he didn’t understand why, knowing her as well as he did.

“It makes me really nervous,” David said, “to think I might not know where the next land mine is going to be with you.”

“It’s not an issue of land mines,” Carole said. “It appears that we have significantly different values, and that makes me question just how well we really do know each other.”

After reiterating how hard it was for her to accept David’s choice not to strongly advocate for her, Carole talked more about why the title and the acknowledgment of Interpersonal Dynamics as a program were so very important to her and how her feelings of being devalued by a system she’d given so much of herself to, and a life of having to fight harder for everything as a woman, were mixed up with it all. She shared how vulnerable she had felt in taking such a strong stance for fear of being misunderstood. And she expressed how deeply disappointed she felt after all she had done to support David and his life’s work for decades, only to learn that when the chips were really down, she couldn’t count on him.

David began to understand the depth and importance of her concerns. At one level, there were no new facts, but he was starting to more fully appreciate what was going on for her. It wasn’t that he changed his mind about prioritizing the budget conversation, but he now moved into empathizing with what this whole situation meant to Carole. At that point, he said, among other things, “I’m seeing what has been going on for you, maybe for the first time. And I’m sorry.”

 It was a big breakthrough for Carole. It was the first time since the rupture that she felt heard, and not looked at as though there was something “wrong” with her for reacting the way she had. Because David was empathetic to why she was so upset, it was a little easier for her to hear that David disagreed with the basis of her stance. It was the first time she felt emotionally met. She experienced David’s empathy and willingness to just be with her, in her upset-ness, without trying to talk her out of it or make her wrong for feeling it. It opened her up to believing they could have this conversation from an emotional-based place instead of through thoughts and opinions.

Carole asked, with genuine curiosity, “Why couldn’t you support me and push for the budget?”

“Carole, you were worried about being successful in running the course. If I hadn’t used all my credit to prevent the cuts, you would have had one hell of a time being successful. Also, if I got you what you wanted, it wouldn’t have given you the status you thought you needed.”

David explained that he was afraid it would actually hurt her credibility down the road if the only reason she’d gotten her requests granted was because he’d insisted. He shared the tremendous pressure he had felt, given the trade-off he’d made about what to push for. Finally, he talked about how he himself had lived with the lack of full recognition for decades and had just come to accept it as part of working in the system. He also talked about his anger and disappointment at her refusal to take over the program unless her conditions were met.

Our issues were highly entangled. We spoke for hours. Even though we explored these issues in much greater depth and gained a clearer understanding of why each of us had responded as we had, everything was not all wrapped up in a neat bow. There had been too much pain in this incident for it to be completely resolved in one sitting. But we had broken through, and enough trust had been restored that we could truly hear each other once again.





Analysis: What Went Wrong—and Why?


Why did two competent people get so stuck? How did everything go so sideways? In this situation, too many factors became too intertwined. It was like a big knot that, when pulled on, just got tighter and tighter. We had to know which string to pull on first.

Throughout this book, we’ve stressed the importance of fully understanding other people, of trying to get to the underlying issues through curiosity and inquiry. Yes, each of us asked questions of the other, but there wasn’t real curiosity. Why?

In David’s case, there were several reasons. He truly believed Carole was so good at her job that she didn’t actually need a title or a program designation to be effective. He thought he knew what was going on with Carole, that it was mainly her ego and insecurity. So why ask? And since he was so sure of his assessment, and his over-the-net attributions of her motives, any “asking” on his part would have been more of an accusation, possibly inflaming Carole even more. There was no genuine curiosity. David also had put up with lack of recognition during his entire career. He’d learned to cope, so why couldn’t she? Then there was his own anger at all the mentoring he had invested in her and, last, the worry about what would happen to the course now.

For Carole’s part, she felt wholly justified in her anger and hurt, and was unable to see anything else. She was a professional and considered herself a person of the highest integrity. She rarely asked for anything for herself and had taken a risk in doing so, which made her feel vulnerable. Her feelings of marginalization ran very deep. Carole had said little to none of this to David in prior conversations.

Thus, logical arguments (from either of us) not only didn’t work but were counterproductive. We had also gotten stuck because of a fundamental difference in values.

At the very core of Carole’s intense reaction was that one of her most fundamental values—loyalty—had been crushed. Carole defined loyalty as “faithfulness to commitments or obligations and allegiances.” That’s why she told David she would have supported him had their places been reversed, full stop. Because she was so clear about what she would do under the circumstances, she never considered that David would act differently.

 David valued loyalty, too, but defined it differently. He saw it as “commitment to another’s growth and success”—and the stronger the relationship, the greater the commitment. That’s why he had gone all out to mentor Carole. And because he so believed in her, he didn’t think what she wanted was necessary for her to be successful.

We had another values difference, in that we both saw ourselves behaving with the utmost integrity and believed we were doing what was best for Touchy-Feely and the school. This certainty led each of us to become judgmental and see the other as wrong. With each of us feeling negatively judged, neither of us felt compelled to understand the other.





What Broke the Impasse?


Our colleagues played a crucial role in pushing us to talk to each other, but we think we could have broken through regardless. It probably would have taken more time but would still have been possible for the following reasons:

We did not “demonize” each other. We did not make up stories that imputed malevolent intentions or bad character. (Carole said that even though she didn’t understand why David had done what he did, she knew it was not his intention to hurt her.) Likewise, each of us was disappointed in the other, but neither jumped to the conclusion that the other was an evil or terrible person. Avoiding those extreme positions made it possible, eventually, for us to understand each other.

Neither of us got locked into false pride. It would have been easy for someone in Carole’s position to be trapped by a stance that reaching out to David would mean losing face. Fortunately, Carole’s pride did not impede her. Also, neither of us had a difficult time saying that we were sorry—whether for something we did or in order to demonstrate understanding of the other’s pain.

 We differentiated understanding from agreement. David never agreed that Carole’s position was objectively right. The breakthrough occurred when he was able to separate that from being able to understand why she was so hurt. Accepting her feelings as valid, and conveying that acceptance, made the difference. Here, again, it took Carole much longer, but she, too, eventually came to understand (and respect) why David made the choices he did.

We let go of logic to explore the deeper personal issues. One of the reasons the first two meetings turned out so poorly was that each of us argued the logic of the issues. And we each wanted to be, first and foremost, “right.” We also had very different opinions about what was best for the course, and each had a logical reason for them. Things may not make logical sense, but they can make psychological sense.

Our outcome met the four criteria of successful conflict resolution. We found a way to go back to really (vs. barely) speaking to each other, we understood each other at a deeper level, our ability to problem-solve improved (so it’s unlikely we will get as stuck again), and our relationship ended up even stronger than it had been before the conflict.





Recovery and Repair: Highlighting the Breaks


Kintsugi, or “golden repair,” is a Japanese art form for fixing broken pottery. Lacquer mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum is applied in such a way as to highlight the breaks while also serving the practical purpose of mending the pot. It is also a philosophy; if an object has been damaged, then it has a history that should be celebrated rather than hidden, covered up, or discarded. The rare-metal powder aggrandizes the break to say that when something has been subjected to damage, it becomes more beautiful. We believe the same orientation applies to the “breaks” in a relationship and how they’re repaired. That has certainly been true for us. Even though we regret our painful impasse, we value what we got out of it.

 Going to the brink of a ruined relationship and recovering gave us confidence that we could handle any future disagreements. We had built an even deeper “emotional bank account.” We came to realize we had held untested assumptions, including a belief that because we had known each other for so many years, we fully and deeply understood each other. That sobering experience prompted us, since then, to move more into inquiry and away from certainty that we knew exactly what was going on with each other.

Our conflict resulted in one more crucial outcome, and that was rebalancing the power relationship between us—illustrating the complexity of exceptional relationships in a work setting. Carole had been in awe of David from the very beginning and felt incredibly fortunate to have been mentored by him. In spite of finding it easy to disagree with David, Carole still had a tendency to defer to him even after she took over some of David’s courses and responsibilities in Interpersonal Dynamics. This power differential was not very evident to either of us, in spite of how much we knew about the costs of power discrepancies. This dynamic, and the fact that we almost always agreed on key issues, meant we had never had a major conflict. In finding our way through this one, Carole came to see and accept David as a mere mortal who can and does make mistakes. This equalized the power differential that had previously existed in our relationship. It was empowering for Carole and freeing for David. Without this shift in power, Carole is not sure she would have agreed to partner with David on the book you hold in your hands.

 It was a long road back for both of us, and we were able to not only recover but also emerge closer than ever. We went from distant, formal interactions, to gradual warming, to back to where we had been before, and then to having an even stronger relationship. It was not an easy journey. But it was well worth the pain and effort, and we have the golden repair to prove it.





EPILOGUE





O wad some Pow’r the giftie gie us

To see oursels as others see us!

—Robert Burns



We want to end this book by talking about fear. That may seem like an odd choice, but it’s only by talking about fear that we can help you see what’s possible without it.

We all hold back sharing significant parts of ourselves because we fear being negatively judged. Don’t think you’re the exception—in all the T-groups we’ve led, participants consistently struggle with, “Do I dare show these parts of myself that I’ve worked so hard to keep hidden?” Think about it: You’ve probably resisted making a commitment to someone else because you were afraid they wouldn’t reciprocate. Perhaps you’ve been hesitant to try something new because you’re afraid of making mistakes. You may not have asked for what you needed, or confronted others when they hurt you, because you feared damaging the relationship. Even more basic is the fear that if someone really knew you—all of you—they would reject you.

We all know people who hold a self-image that is very different from how others see them. Is that partially true for you? Is it really a gift to “see ourselves as others see us,” especially if it destroys a self-image that you’ve worked hard to develop? You may fear losing your self-esteem and sense of personal worth if you take in another’s feedback.

These fears limit growth and learning and reduce willingness to take risks and experiment with new behavior. They keep you stuck in unhappy situations you are loath to confront, and they consume a huge amount of energy. They cost you real connection. “Fear” is sometimes an acronym for “false expectations appearing real.”

Most of all, these fears limit your likelihood of moving your relationships to exceptional. As we have illustrated time and again, it is only when we can manage our fears and take the necessary risks that exceptional becomes possible. And that results in a paradox. Just as fear can limit you, the risks you take as you build and maintain an exceptional relationship can free you from much of that fear. That is partly because you have tested those fears, only to discover they were false expectations. The process of building deep relationships has increased your interpersonal competence and given you the confidence you need to speak your truth and be more fully yourself.

All of this frees you from constantly asking, “Do I dare say…,” “What does she think of me when I…,” or “How does he feel about my doing…” Instead of wasting energy on self-doubt, you can focus it on curiosity and learning. Sure, you may still worry about how things will turn out, but that’s different from worrying about being rejected for who you are. In this way, exceptional relationships help you shift from living in black and white to living in full color.

At the heart of an exceptional relationship, then, is a unique experience of freedom that feels almost magical. Because you know the other cares for you and will be honest, you can hear their feedback. This results in knowing yourself in a much fuller way. You know specifically what you do well and how to leverage those strengths. You see your weaknesses not as something to beat yourself up about, but as a part of being human that gives you opportunities to grow. Exceptional relationships allow you to pressure-test your beliefs. Maybe some assumptions that served you well in the past don’t anymore. Another’s feedback and perspective offer you the chance to broaden the way you see situations and even influence your understanding of the choices you have.

But most of all, those you care about accept you, in all of your flawed humanness. You have narrowed any gap between how others see you and how you see yourself. Their acceptance helps you accept yourself. The freedom that results is unparalleled.

Knowing yourself and accepting yourself allows you to develop an internal gyroscope—you know, like one of those inflatable toys that can be hit but always comes back to center. You aren’t upended by feedback or controlled by another’s reactions. You’re solidly connected to who you are and to your worth, which allows you to take in others’ perspectives. Learning and growing always require risk-taking, but now you have a strong foundation. You’re perfectly positioned to be a lifelong learner. And you have the capacity to profoundly connect with another human being.

You’ve reached the top of the mountain. You’ve a much wider view of the world than you had when you were in the valley or even the upper meadow. You know that being there with someone else will give you plenty of opportunities to see new vistas from different vantage points. And having made this climb several times, you know it’s possible to make it again, with others. Much more connection and magic await.





To Eva and Andy—

our heroic spouses who love and accept us for who we are and whose patience and support sustained us throughout this journey





ACKNOWLEDGMENTS




It is unlikely we would have written this book were it not for Daniel Crewe of Penguin Random House, who called us to ask if we were interested in writing a book based on the famous “Touchy-Feely” course at Stanford. First and foremost, we thank him for inviting us to embark on this journey, believing in us, and providing constant support along with many editorial suggestions over three years. Additionally, a big thank-you to our Crown editor, Emma Berry, for her exceptional responsiveness, improving one draft after another with her gifted editor’s eye, and for making this work that much stronger.

We are deeply grateful to Jenna Free for her patient guidance as she took our original manuscript and helped turn it into something far more readable. She was masterful at flagging redundancies, clarifying content, cutting through unnecessarily dense material, and helping bring the book more fully to life. Her rigorous editing taught us that often less is more. And a big thank-you to our wonderful agent, Howard Yoon, for guiding us through this process.

Our appreciation extends to Mary Ann Huckabay, to our good friend and frequent informal advisor Max Richards for his extensive input on the manuscript and stellar work on references, and to Adele Kellman and Vanessa Loder, each of whom read the manuscript at different times and made specific suggestions that helped advance our thinking.

Numerous people provided us with feedback and sage counsel at different points along the way. We thank our Interpersonal Dynamics colleagues Ed Batista, Leslie Chin, Andrea Corney, Collins Dobbs, and Yifat Levine, and our dear departed friend Lanz Lowen, who went over our original proposal and helped us set the direction of the book.

Over the ensuing three years, we gained invaluable suggestions from Alan Briskin, Gary Dexter, Basya Gale, Mary Garber, Susan Harris, Tony Levitan, Edgar Schein, and Roger Scholl. All of their ideas and input, whether we accepted them or not, invited us to pause and consider more deeply what we wanted to say. The book greatly changed over the years we worked on it. Connect would have undoubtedly been a lesser work without their input. We take full responsibility for any limitations in the final product.

Thank you Patricia Will for Casa Taupa; Roy Bahat, Ricki Frankel, Cynthia Gorney, and Wendy Cavendish for commiserating, cheerleading, and providing enthusiastic support; and the gang at Leaders in Tech for picking up the slack time and time again.

We want to acknowledge and thank our thousands of students and clients who not only shaped our thinking but also impacted each of us personally. We hope to have done justice to what they taught us about developing meaningful relationships. During the writing of this book, we had hundreds of conversations with many, many people, and while it is impractical to name them all, we apologize for our failure to acknowledge them specifically.

Lastly, in addition to our spouses, to whom we have dedicated this book, we are immensely grateful to our children and our grandchildren—Jeff Bradford (Sophia Lau), Winry Bradford, Kendra Bradford (Todd Shuster), Lev Shuster, Gail Shuster, Nick Robin (Alex Robin), and Molly Robin—who have played such significant roles in our lives and helped us understand what it takes to build exceptional relationships.

APPENDIX B





Furthering Your Learning


The most important and long-lasting skill we hope you take away from this book is that you have learned how to learn. Research on T-groups shows that participants who have acquired the competencies in this book continue to learn after the course is over, thanks to a positively reinforcing cycle. Take advantage of this cycle, of this ability to stretch yourself, by reminding yourself of what you’ve learned:

How to be more fully yourself, including seeing the power in expressing your emotions. You have learned how to use the 15 Percent Rule for increasing self-disclosure in building relationships. Even though there can be risks in being vulnerable, in most cases the benefits far exceed the costs. Being willing to be more fully known takes courage, and you have learned that vulnerability can come much more out of strength than out of weakness.



How to build conditions where the other person is willing to disclose and be more themselves. Listening for their feelings and encouraging their full expression is crucial in that process. Likewise, you have learned not to rush to judgment but instead to be curious when you don’t initially understand the other or they do something that upsets you. You also have learned to value the other’s uniqueness as opposed to requiring that they be just like you.



The limitation of giving advice and the power of open-ended questions. You have increased your ability to be empathetic, and just as you want to be more fully known and accepted, you have learned to do the same for the other person.



How to give and receive behaviorally specific feedback, to both raise and resolve difficulties, and to help the other see what they do well and might build on. The difficulties between you and the other might range from minor pinches to some major conflicts, but irrespective of where the issue is along that range, you see that feedback, although challenging at times, doesn’t have to be an attack. Instead, it can be a way to surface the core issues so that both of you can jointly resolve them. Feedback truly is a gift when you are both invested in each other’s growth and in your relationship.



Appreciating the power and range of emotions, you have become aware of your capacity to feel many at the same time, as well as all the ways you can block yourself from recognizing and appropriately using them.



Support comes in many forms, but being supportive sometimes requires raising difficult issues that can be uncomfortable for both the giver and the recipient. In doing so, you have learned how to be more honest than you thought possible. That honesty starts with sticking with your reality—how the other person’s behavior is affecting you—not in providing your psychological interpretation of their motives or character.



You have many more choices than you previously thought. It is not that you “can’t” do or say something, but that you choose not to. Sometimes saying nothing is the best alternative, but it’s important to recognize that’s nonetheless a choice.



Conflict need not be destructive. If you use the feedback model, difficult issues can be raised and resolved in a way that actually strengthens the relationship.



Relationships rarely develop in a straight line. It’s often “two steps forward and one step back.” Building meaningful relationships requires persistence; difficulties are just temporary barriers that can be resolved, and damage can be repaired.



You have learned more about yourself—what you do well and how you limit yourself. Perhaps most important, you see the multiple sources of learning. You can learn from your emotions, since they can signal what’s important to you. You can learn by asking yourself, “Why am I reacting as I am?” You can learn from feedback, since others know, and tell you, the impact of your behavior. And you have learned what situations are likely to trigger you.





But perhaps most important of all, using these competencies has helped you learn from your experiences, as you’ve taken action to improve your relationships. You have seen what works well for you and another person and, rather than denying problems, have learned from glitches so that you and the other can do better next time. Strengthened by these competencies, you are less afraid of taking risks. That’s what gives you the freedom to continue to learn.





A CALL TO ACTION


Based on the summary above and now that you have read this book, what stands out as most important for you to work on?



Setting Specific Learning Goals: You are more competent and comfortable with some of these competencies than with others. You can’t work on all of them at once, so remember the 15 Percent Rule and pick the ones that are more important. Likewise, are there ways that you tend to limit and trap yourself? Being aware of what you want to work on and what is successful increases the chance that you will see opportunities to put your skills to the test.



Getting Assistance: Others are instrumental in helping you reach your learning goals, as it’s hard to significantly change all on your own. For example, you might not see that you’re backing down, even though one of your objectives is to give greater voice to your opinions. Share what you want to work on with someone you trust and ask them to be aware of times when you fall into one of your traps or have missed an opportunity to work on one of your change goals. They might also help you further clarify your goals and think through ways to achieve them.



Recording and Reflecting: Earlier in the book, we encouraged you to keep a journal, not just to record progress made, but as a place to reflect. Let’s say you had an unsuccessful experience where, once again, you didn’t lead with your feelings. What was going on that led to that? Did you have trouble with certain emotions? Were you caught in an ego trap that made it difficult to be vulnerable?





There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, of a patient who asked a therapist, “How do I know when I’m cured?” The response was “When you catch yourself before I do.” Long-held habits are difficult to erase. You might continue to have difficulty with conflict. Make the goal less about being comfortable with confrontation than about being competent. It takes practice and persistence to lay down new behavioral pathways. But keep at it and honor your progress. Don’t be thrown by temporary setbacks.

In closing, we come back to Auguste Renoir’s dying words: “I think I’m beginning to learn something about it.” We wish you a lifetime of continued development in which there are constant discoveries until the very end. That’s what life should be about.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS





David Bradford, PhD, is the Eugene O’Kelly II Senior Lecturer Emeritus in Leadership at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he has taught for over fifty years. He was the primary architect for the legendary “Touchy-Feely” course (aka Interpersonal Dynamics), which is one of the school’s flagship offerings. He introduced leadership to the GSB curriculum at the MBA and executive levels by developing multiple courses and mentoring colleagues for nearly four decades.

He founded the Organizational Behavior Teaching Society, a professional organization dedicated to experiential learning, and was its journal’s first editor. He has co-authored seven other books, including the classic Influence Without Authority and Power Up: Transforming Organizations Through Shared Leadership.

In addition, he has provided executive coaching and consulted numerous organizations in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, including Levi Strauss, IBM, Genentech, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

He lives in Berkeley with Eva, his wife of more than fifty years. They have two children and three grandchildren.

Carole Robin, PhD, was the Dorothy J. King Lecturer in Leadership at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she helped to further develop the Interpersonal Dynamics course, including co-developing the executive version. She also became the director of the Arbuckle Leadership Fellows Program. She was known as the Queen of Touchy-Feely and received the MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. When she retired in 2017, a scholarship was established in her name. Subsequently, she co-founded Leaders in Tech, a nonprofit that brings two decades of lessons to Silicon Valley startups.

Prior to joining Stanford, she was a partner in an international consulting firm and a senior manager in a Fortune 500 company. She has provided executive coaching, leadership development, and executive team building to a wide range of business, government, and nonprofit clients ranging in size from startups to global and Fortune 500 organizations, and is currently an advisor on several boards. She is the recipient of two Congressional Awards for community service.
