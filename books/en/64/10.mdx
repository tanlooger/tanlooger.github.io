title: 10 OWN YOUR EMOTIONS OR THEY WILL OWN YOU
---







Mia and Aniyah—Longtime Friends, Part 1


See if this sounds familiar: You’re having what starts out as a perfectly lovely dinner—with your parent or your partner, your friend or your child—when seemingly for no reason, the conversation takes a nosedive. Some innocuous comment leads to a retort, which leads to an accusation, and things only get worse from there. Suddenly, allegations fly, old injuries are raised, and for the life of you, you can’t figure out why. It’s like steam you didn’t even realize had been building up is now out of control, and something has finally blown up.

While there’s no one-size-fits-all diagnosis, chances are excellent that the mismanagement of emotions played a role. “Mismanagement” can mean many things. It can mean that suppressed feelings have built up to the point of this explosion. It can also mean you’ve been numbing emotions—that you’re scarcely aware that they’ve been there all along.

Previous chapters covered the many reasons you might push emotions away. This chapter shows the price you pay for doing this and how it can not only build explosive conditions but also cause each party to get locked into a rigid position. The more you know your emotions, the less likely you are to be controlled by them, and the greater the number of choices you’ll have in how to express them productively.





Mia and Aniyah, Part 1


Aniyah and Mia have been friends since they were college roommates and confidantes around boyfriends, career choices, and the transition to adulthood. This close, trusting relationship continued after graduation, even though they lived far apart. They regularly talked on the phone and visited each other when they could. They attended each other’s weddings and shared the ups and downs as children came into their lives.

Then Mia and her husband, Jake, moved their family to Philadelphia, where Aniyah and her husband, Christopher, lived. Mia and Aniyah hoped this would allow the four of them to get together, but their husbands never quite gelled. The two women instead tried to regularly meet up for dinner, but what with children and full-time jobs, these dinners were less frequent than they’d hoped.

They loved seeing each other, but they found their previous intimacy had diminished. They didn’t talk about it, but they shared less with each other than they used to. Maybe it’s because I have Jake and other friends, Mia mused. That closeness might have been something I needed earlier in my life but don’t need as much now. Not to mention that the kids take up all my time. Or maybe it’s because Jake and I are better off than Aniyah and Christopher, and it’s weird for them. She decided to put those thoughts aside and looked forward to an upcoming date with Aniyah.

They met at one of their favorite French bistros and spent the first part of dinner catching up on life, as was their custom. Toward the end of the meal, Aniyah lamented, “I’m so tired all the time. I’m always behind on everything and no matter how much I cut back on my sleep and exercise, I can’t seem to make much headway.”

Mia nodded. “I know just what you mean. I’m juggling a lot, too, between the promotion, the kids, and the new house construction. What I’d give for five more hours in every day!”

 Aniyah felt a tiny bit of resentment, though she knew Mia meant well. So she responded, “Yeah, I know you have a lot going on, too. But at least you’re tired as a result of all kinds of good stuff. I’m stuck in the same rut at work, and half the time I feel like a bad mother for all the time I could be with the kids.”

“What are you talking about? You’re a great mother!”

“Nice of you to say, but I don’t think so. Just last week I was supposed to chaperone Evan’s field trip but had to cancel. My boss asked for yet another last-minute change to the report we’ve been working on. Evan was so disappointed.” Aniyah’s eyes started to water. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what I’m getting all worked up about; I guess I’m just tired. Or maybe I hadn’t realized how much it was all getting to me.”

“Maybe it’s time for you to finally find a new job.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Aniyah asked.

“Just that I’ve heard you complain about it for quite a while now,” said Mia, “so it seems like it’s time to look for something else.”

Aniyah felt disappointed and irritated. “Easy for you to say, Mia. Everything is just great in your life. Plus, we need my income and my job pays well.”

Both of them lapsed into silence, which broke only when the waiter came to offer them dessert and they declined.

“I’m only trying to help, Aniyah, but I feel like anything I say gets your back up. Why are you so sensitive?”

“Sometimes being sensitive about what’s going on for someone else is a good thing,” Aniyah replied.

“What does that mean?”

Aniyah sighed deeply. “Look, I’m really tired. I shared something personal, and all I got from you was telling me to find a new job. I know you mean well, Mia, but it feels like you are not hearing how hard this all is for me.” Aniyah thought about all the times she’d left their conversations feeling more and more insecure. Mia always seemed to have all the answers. Doesn’t Mia ever struggle with anything? she wondered.

 “How can you say that? Of course I know how hard this is for you!” Mia fired back. “How could you possibly think I don’t?”

“I just don’t,” answered Aniyah. “Plus, hearing about your promotion and the new house you’re building makes it all worse. I know I shouldn’t say that because I wish nothing but the best for you.”

“So I shouldn’t share what’s going on in my life but just listen to your issues? Geez, it’s like a minefield with you. I don’t know what to say that won’t make things worse.” As usual, Mia thought, Aniyah is oversensitive. Talking with her feels like walking on eggshells. “Maybe we should call it a night.”

Aniyah paid for her half of the meal and with a resigned tone said, “Agreed.”

“Well, that was a great use of an evening away from Jake and the kids,” said Mia sarcastically as they walked toward their cars.

“Now it’s gotten late,” said Aniyah, “and I’m even more exhausted than when I arrived. I just need to get home. Sorry.”

“Me too,” said Mia.

They got in their respective cars feeling angry and resentful toward each other.





Releasing Steam: What Happened?


In a nutshell, Mia and Aniyah violated everything covered in prior chapters.

They let pinches build up: Each of them had a number of issues. Aniyah was bothered that Mia rarely raised any personal problems of her own. Aniyah didn’t find her especially empathetic when Aniyah shared her struggle. Instead, Mia gave advice, which Aniyah saw as an indication of how little Mia really understood her. Aniyah also felt envious of Mia’s greater job satisfaction and affluence.

Mia also had pent-up pinches. She was tired of Aniyah’s continued complaints about her job and her (perceived) unwillingness to do anything about it and sounding like a victim. She wanted to help Aniyah but was frustrated by what she thought was Aniyah’s hypersensitivity. Mia wanted to share more about her job and the new house but felt inhibited because she sensed Aniyah’s envy.

Any one of these issues wasn’t such a big deal, which is probably why Mia and Aniyah hadn’t previously raised them—even though, if brought up earlier, they might have been more easily resolved. But the buildup over time made them destructive.



They didn’t state their feelings: Even though there were “I feel” statements, they began “I feel like,” which expressed a thought, not an emotion. At the same time, their tone and choice of words conveyed some strong unexpressed feelings.



They played the blame game: If Aniyah and Mia’s respective husbands asked them, “How’d it go?” as they walked in the door, each would have talked about all the reasonable things they tried to communicate and how inappropriate the other person was. When Aniyah told Mia, “It feels like you are not hearing how hard this all is for me,” and “Everything is just great in your life,” a number of unexpressed emotions morphed into an attack. This allowed each to feel self-righteous and blame the other. When Mia asked, “Why are you so sensitive?” she wasn’t really asking a question, she was making an accusation.

The blame game is rarely productive. It doesn’t lead to self-reflection and inhibits openness to discovering the underlying problems, let alone wanting to solve them. It closes down the other person, creates defensiveness, and usually leads to reciprocal blame.



They didn’t attempt to understand each other: Since each of them believed she was right and that the other was behaving poorly, and each assumed she knew the other’s motives, there was little incentive to move into inquiry. The time when this might have been most fruitful was when Aniyah started to tear up after talking about missing her son’s field trip. If Mia had responded at a feeling level and with empathy said, “Aniyah, I’m worried. What’s going on?” it might have shifted the entire conversation.

Instead, Mia chose to make a logical recommendation (“Maybe it’s time for you to finally find a new job”) that closed Aniyah down and left her feeling even more vulnerable. It was a missed opportunity on Mia’s part, but her pent-up annoyance blocked the empathy she might have normally felt for one of her best friends.

As the conversation went on, each of them became more self-righteous and defensive, making it harder to be curious about what was really going on with the other. At one point in the conversation Aniyah asked, “What’s that supposed to mean?” And later Mia said, “What does that mean?” However, in both cases, their tone was more defensive/attacking than an expression of real interest.

It was fortuitous that the evening ended when it did. The two friends were not in a space where they were managing their emotions particularly well, and their feelings could easily have escalated into a level of damage from which the relationship might never have recovered. This is why we feel so strongly that you must own your emotions or they will own you. By “owning,” we’re not suggesting suppressing, which is what each of them did. Rather, owning and managing emotions is about expressing them, but doing so in productive ways.





Recognizing and Owning Emotions


When David first started conducting T-groups at Stanford almost fifty years ago, students often responded, “I don’t know,” when asked what they were feeling. In the ensuing years, research on emotional intelligence and other factors have made emotional expression more acceptable in society, and total unawareness is far less common. But most people have a tendency to first go to their head, to try to understand what’s going on logically, before paying attention to their own or someone else’s feelings. It’s a hard habit to break. The two of us have worked in this field for decades, but at times even we need to pause and ask ourselves, “What exactly am I feeling?”

In Carole’s case, pushing down feelings—numbing them—started early. Her mother had a terrible temper, and Carole’s earliest memories are of cowering somewhere in the house where she could remain under the radar while her mother ranted, screamed, and slammed doors. Carole became deeply afraid of anger, seeing it as a bad emotion that was best not to feel. She had to work hard to become aware of when she was angry and learn to express it appropriately. As Brené Brown points out, we can’t selectively numb emotions, for “when we numb anger, sadness, and fear, we also numb gratitude, love, and joy.”

The workplace hasn’t exactly been an ally in the cause of emotional expression. For decades, organizations stressed the importance of keeping feelings out of the workplace. In 1975, Carole was hired at a Fortune 500 company, the first woman to be hired in a nonclerical role. The first thing she learned was that if she was going to succeed in business, especially as a woman in that era, she had to act like the men—meaning be aggressive, strong, bold, and above all, calm, rational, and unemotional. Feelings had no place. She became very good at this, and it served her well. However, as she rose up the ranks, moved to another company, and became a high-level manager, her rational model became limiting.

 At one point she was running a $50 million sales and marketing business when, at a management offsite with her team, she got choked up as she passionately spoke about what they could achieve if they all pulled together. She was met by stunned silence. One of her managers (a man, by the way; they were all men) said, “Wow, looks like you’re human after all.” And then Carole really did burst out crying. “You don’t think I’m human?”

She tore up the day’s agenda and declared there was nothing more important to talk about than this. What followed was one of the most genuine, authentic, and rewarding business conversations of her career. A conversation about who she really was and what she deeply cared about, followed by each of the managers sharing who they were and what mattered most to them. Feelings of hope, sadness, pride, disappointment, frustration, and caring poured out of everyone. They all came to realize that they had been leaving half of themselves, perhaps the most important half, in the parking lot. The more they talked, the more fully they became known to one another.

After that offsite, they built themselves into an unstoppable team. To this day, Carole knows those seven men would follow her anywhere. Had this happened during her first year on the job, when she had less credibility and confidence, it is unlikely the outcome would have been as good.

Emotions are delegitimized beyond workplaces, too. Most of our education system stresses logic and reason, as do early socialization experiences: “You shouldn’t be angry.” “You shouldn’t be hurt by negative feedback since the other said they were just trying to help.” “You shouldn’t be mad at your baby brother” (even though he is now taking all the attention that you used to get!). Our shouldn’ts often prevent us from recognizing what we are feeling.

Parents with the best of intentions still send signals that negate feelings. When David’s son, Jeffrey, was four, David took him to the neighborhood park to play. In going down the slide, Jeffrey hit the back of his head on the bottom edge and started to cry. David rushed over, picked him up, and said, “Jeffrey, you’re not hurt.” But he got his comeuppance. Still with tears streaming down his face, Jeffrey retorted, “How do you know how I feel? Only I know how I feel.”

 David wasn’t consciously trying to deny Jeffrey’s feelings. He just wasn’t being honest about his own. The more accurate (and supportive) thing to say would have been, “I’m feeling bad that you’re hurting.”

Even when people do express feelings, they tend to downplay their intensity. We conceptualize emotions on a ten-point scale, from very mild to extreme. Not infrequently, it’s only when an emotion passes a threshold of seven that people notice or report it. While low-level feelings might not be worth expressing, what about those in the midrange? Sometimes in a T-group, a participant will say, “I was a little annoyed at that comment.” We then hold our hand sideways with a quarter-inch gap between thumb and forefinger and say humorously, “Just a little?” The student often laughs and says, “Actually not,” leading to a more accurate and fruitful conversation.

Somatic responses (such as a flutter in our stomach, a slight change in our heartbeat, tingling in our neck, tightness in our throat, or damp palms) offer important clues about our emotions. These responses can wake us up out of our numbness and help us recognize the severity of what’s going on. More often than not, though, we ignore them—even when research suggests that doing so can adversely affect our health, our happiness, and the quality of our relationships. We also “leak” emotions, through sharpness of tone or facial expressions of disdain, which results in even more dysfunctional exchanges, like the one between Mia and Aniyah. But it’s likely that in the heat of their argument, neither of them were fully aware of all they were feeling.





What Could Mia and Aniyah Have Done?


The two friends were in a tough spot. They were both exhausted, in a public place, and sitting on pent-up feelings. Perhaps the best thing they did was call it a night and minimize the damage. That said, as mentioned, they would have had more options if they had chosen to go down a different path earlier in the conversation.

Let’s pick up the story where Mia said, “I’m only trying to help, Aniyah, but I feel like anything I say gets your back up. Why are you so sensitive?” There are at least three good options here. At the heart of all of them is the interpersonal cycle from chapter 7 and the concept of staying with your reality and on your side of the net.





OPTION 1: STICKING WITH FEELINGS


Let’s suppose Aniyah responded by disclosing: “Mia, I’m really feeling hurt, partially by that comment, but also by this conversation.” Even though we have argued that a willingness to be vulnerable can break down barriers, it might be too much to expect Aniyah to be that vulnerable since she was already feeling one-down and she’d just been accused of being overly sensitive. But if she could have expressed her pain, it might have led Mia to do the same and respond with empathy and an apology: “I’m sorry. I don’t want to hurt you. What can I do?”

Perhaps Mia could be the one who sticks with her feelings to break the logjam. She might catch herself by saying something like, “Oh, that was a horrible thing to say. I’m sorry.” Or “I feel bad about how I’ve been responding to you this evening. It’s just been so hard for me to hear your unhappiness. Everything is not always so rosy for me either.”

That would be great, but let’s do another plausibility test. How likely is it that, just after her accusation, Mia would pivot 180 degrees, especially given her growing irritation with Aniyah’s complaints? Is it reasonable to expect that she would disclose those feelings? Probably not.

 However, there is a way for Mia and Aniyah to share their feelings without having to abruptly shift from anger to compassion. We previously noted that anger is a second-order emotion and there are usually more vulnerable feelings beneath it. If either Mia or Aniyah were aware of this, could they have stopped to ask themselves, “What am I so upset about? What is making me so angry?” Then it might have been possible to follow up with, “I realize that the reason that I am so upset and angry is that I am also feeling [hurt/​discounted/​helpless, etc.].”

Such emotional openness on either of their parts would likely be the quickest way to stop this growing escalation. But that’s difficult to do in the heat of the conflict, so while option 1 exists, it’s hard to access.





OPTION 2: RECOGNIZING AND OVERCOMING EGO TRAPS


There are a series of ego traps that Mia and Aniyah could have avoided during their contentious situation, such as refusing to apologize until the other did first, thinking that admitting hurt was a sign of weakness, or needing to make the other out to be the bad person in order to feel better about themselves.

False pride locks you into a rigid stance and often leads to giving up control of what will happen. Often just catching yourself by recognizing that it is your ego at play is enough. Admitting that false pride is at work can be easier than the first option. Could either have recognized any of these traps or other ways they were being self-righteous and admitted that?





OPTION 3: PROCESSING WHAT’S GOING ON AND FOCUSING ON THE FUTURE


As we have discussed before, when two people are stuck, it is sometimes important to step back and ask, “What’s going on? Can we get out of this?” Either Mia or Aniyah could have said that, being mindful that it not turn into a blame game.

One of the ways they could have prevented the blame from escalating was to talk about what they wanted from the relationship. Mia and Aniyah were not as intimate as they’d once been. Each of them missed their more personal, caring interactions and past closeness. Either could have said, “This evening’s conversation isn’t like the ones we used to have. In the past, I felt a real caring and closeness that I’m missing. I’d like to have that again. What about you?”

If either of them could have received that offer openly, and if they could each have avoided the trap of accusing the other of sabotaging their former intimacy, there’s a chance they could have identified what they each wanted. At that point, it might have been possible to work on some of the built-up pinches.

Note that these three options aren’t mutually exclusive but could, in the best of all possible worlds, build on each other. Stepping back to look at what is going on and reminding themselves of the relationship they want and miss could have led them into inquiry and disclosure of their feelings. The greatest takeaway is that when you’re aware of feelings in real time, you have more choices on how to proceed.

All three options require vulnerability, which is challenging when you’re feeling hurt and misunderstood. But as they say, no risk, no reward.

Clearly, Aniyah and Mia did not choose any of these options during the heat of their dinner. That doesn’t mean it’s too late for them. They’d reached an impasse, a logjam, but logjams can be broken. The next chapter explores how.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself first in Aniyah’s situation. How would you have likely responded at different junctures? Then put yourself in Mia’s position and do the same thing. Don’t answer with how you think you should have responded but how you likely would have.



Getting Stuck: Think back to various times when you have gotten “stuck” in arguments with others. Do you see a pattern in ways that your ego got in the way? Consider which of these following statements ring true:

 I have a hard time apologizing until the other person does first.



I have a difficult time saying that I am sorry.



It is hard for me to admit that I was wrong.



I tend to think my position is usually right; it’s hard for me to understand the other’s position.



I need to show that the other is more responsible for the problem than I am.



I try to find reasons for finding the other person at fault.



I find it hard to say that I am feeling hurt.



When I have been hurt by another, I find it hard to let go of my resentment.



I tend to see any negative feedback or criticism as a personal attack and get very defensive.



I am self-righteous when I think the other person is wrong.





These tend to be ways that we protect ourselves. For the item(s) you selected, what are you concerned might occur if you didn’t do this?



Logjams: Mia and Aniyah got into their logjam for four major reasons. For the situations you identified above, do any of these tend to occur?

 Letting pinches build up



Not stating your feelings (but getting into logical arguments or making accusations)



Playing the blame game



Not trying to understand the other





APPLICATION


Take one of your key relationships in which, at one time or another, you have gotten stuck. Based on the list under the second self-reflection question above, which ones tended to occur for you or the other person? Discuss this with them and see if you can work out a way to prevent it from happening again.

Do you have a disagreement (with a key relationship or anyone else) that is unresolved? Decide how you will break that logjam and give it a shot.





MAKING SENSE


How did your conversations go? What did you learn about yourself and about these types of discussions? What are you committed to doing the next time you are in a conversation that is stuck? What especially do you want to use from what you have learned?
