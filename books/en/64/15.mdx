Mia and Aniyah, Parts 4 and 5


As relationships grow, conversations deepen. How should you handle your aging parents? Should you have children? How are you supposed to come to grips with getting laid off? What do you do about stressful financial obligations or a serious stressor in your marriage? As the topics become more personal, there’s a greater chance that the discussion will have emotional resonance, because there’s more intensity and realness to the interaction. And yet it makes objectivity harder. What to do if the topic raised by the other stirs up personal feelings of how you have dealt, are currently dealing, or will deal with similar situations?

In this chapter, we return to Mia and Aniyah. After their falling-out and then successful repair, they made a point of meeting on a more regular basis. In those get-togethers, each shared a variety of personal issues. Aniyah was able to talk more openly with Mia about the good and the bad in her work. Mia opened up to Aniyah about her concerns with her teenage son’s relationship with his girlfriend. These and similar conversations drew the two of them even closer over the following year, as they realized they’d regained the same sort of connection they’d had as college roommates. But then things got complicated.





Mia and Aniyah, Part 4


Over dinner one evening, Mia seemed especially moody and distracted—a pattern Aniyah had noticed in previous dinners, too.

“Mia, you don’t seem yourself,” she said. “Is something bothering you?”

Mia looked down at her wine. “Yeah,” she said, “something is bothering me, but I don’t know how much I want to go into it.”

“Your choice, of course. But if you do, I’d be glad to listen.”

“I don’t really know….I’m definitely feeling off…and a bit down. I should be happy. Or rather, I have no reason not to be. I have a good job, a beautiful house, and a husband who loves me. And yet I feel little excitement in my life and it’s really bothering me. Life just feels so humdrum, you know? Every day looks like every other day. I find myself wondering if this is really all there is.”

“I’m so sorry,” Aniyah said. “That’s a tough place to be. Any sense of what’s causing it? Are things okay with Jake?”

“Yes…sort of. He’s so loving, but to be honest, we feel more like close friends than lovers. It doesn’t have the energy that it used to have.”

“Well, you’ve been married for nearly twenty years,” Aniyah said. “It’s unrealistic to think it’s going to be like the first ten. And having kids, no matter how much we love them, always takes a bit away from us as couples. That’s certainly true with Christopher and me.”

“Yeah, I know that intellectually, but I still want more. Don’t you?”

“Sure, at some abstract level. But life isn’t all roses. Don’t we have to take all the good we have and not expect everything to be perfect?”

“Yes, I guess so. I’m sure I’ll get over it,” said Mia, and their conversation moved on to other issues.

A month went by before the friends were able to meet again for dinner. Mia was chatty and her demeanor was much lighter. After they ordered and caught up on a number of fronts, Mia said, “I’m so glad we’re having dinner.”

 “Me too. What’s going on with you? You seem really ‘up.’ ”

Mia smiled. “You’ve been right to encourage me to share more. I’ve realized that I’ve been trying to sweep my feelings of dissatisfaction under the rug for too long. The more I ignore it, the worse it gets.”

“Good to hear. Sounds like things are better.”

“Yeah, they are, actually. There’s this guy I knew years ago—Tyler—who suddenly friended me on Facebook,” Mia said. “He was going to be in town and mentioned it might be nice to reconnect. So we got together for drinks and had a great time. He was so interesting as well as interested. We talked about all sorts of things, and the longer we sat there, the more I noticed how alive I felt. It was more fun than I’ve had in years. I can’t remember the last time I felt that way with Jake.”

Aniyah felt her stomach sink. “Uh-oh…”

“Uh-oh what? For goodness’ sake, Aniyah. All I’m saying is that it was great to banter and laugh and have a conversation with real depth. I never wanted it to end.”

“Hmmm. So how did the evening end?”

“Well, nothing happened, of course. We’re both married. But we talked about what a great time we had and decided maybe we’d get together for lunch when he’s in town again. He’s going to be coming here a lot on business.”

“Yikes, Mia, I can’t help but worry about where this might all lead.”

Mia brushed Aniyah’s comment aside. “Let’s not make a big deal out of this. I just met an interesting man and think it would be fun to have lunch with him. That’s all.”

Aniyah was dubious that it wouldn’t turn into a bigger deal but chose to say nothing more than “Okay.” Their conversation shifted to Aniyah’s talking about exciting changes in her company.

 At their next dinner, a month later, Mia rushed hurriedly to the table, where Aniyah was already seated. Aniyah commented on how happy she looked.

“Thanks! I feel really great. Tyler and I had lunch again yesterday and I’m still flying high from it.” She went on to explain that it was their second lunch since she’d seen Aniyah.

Aniyah didn’t say anything but frowned slightly.

“Nothing more has happened…yet,” she said, “but I can see where this might be headed. I find myself thinking about him a lot. Aniyah, maybe this is crazy, but it’s what I’ve been missing in my life—I haven’t felt this alive in years.”

Aniyah felt her body tense up. She took a sip of her drink and said, “Geez, Mia, this all seems to be happening very fast. I’m not sure being bored is a good reason to toss a marriage overboard.”

Mia’s face fell. “Well, that’s disappointing. You said yourself, I look happy, and for the first time in ages, I am. Why can’t you be more supportive?”

“You don’t really want me to tell you it’s okay to go have an affair, do you?”

“Not exactly—but I do want you to at least empathize with my situation. Haven’t you had similar feelings of wanting something more out of your marriage or dreading that the next forty years of your life were going to be one boring day after another?”

Aniyah chose her words carefully. “I can empathize with feeling bored and restless. Yes, there are times I’ve felt that way. But I think it would be pretty messed up if you went off and had a lovefest with Tyler.”

“Aniyah, I don’t think you get it. You’re being so judgy. I just feel so trapped, and every day a little more unhappy. Why can’t you understand?”

“There’s a difference between understanding and supporting what I think is a bad choice,” said Aniyah. “I can’t help but think about all the things that could go wrong. Just seems like a line that’s really hard to come back from once you cross it.”

 “What’s going on with you? You’ve been really negative about this from the very beginning. This is my life I’m talking about—not yours.”

Aniyah put her face in her hands and began to cry softly. “It’s about me, too….You don’t know how painful all of this is.”

Mia’s face softened and she reached across the table to hold Aniyah’s hand. “What’s going on, Aniyah?”

Trying to control herself, Aniyah said, “A few years ago, Christopher had an affair. I never told you about it because it was when we’d drifted apart, and since then the affair has felt like ancient history. Except that hearing you talk about Tyler has taken me back to those old feelings of hurt and betrayal. I guess the pain of it all is still there, just under the surface….It’s just so embarrassing. I feel ashamed about the whole thing and afraid you’ll think less of me now that I’ve told you. Christopher said all the words that you’re now saying. I worried at the time that it was my fault, somehow, and that I’m inadequate or had done something wrong. Listening to you stirs all that back up.”

“Oh no, I’m so sorry—I certainly didn’t expect this would be where our conversation went. No, I don’t think less of you. I don’t think my unhappiness is Jake’s fault, and Christopher’s affair may not have had anything to do with you.”

“In the end, Christopher and I obviously worked things out, but I really wasn’t sure we’d get through it. It was all so painful, Mia. I’d hate to see you go through that.”

“I hear you, and I’m touched that you’re worried about me. But this is my life, Aniyah. And I may need to see whether this thing with Tyler is real. You are the only person I can talk about this with.”

“I feel deeply conflicted,” said Aniyah. “It’s so hard to separate my own experience from my reaction to what you’re saying. The affair was bad enough, but what was worse was that Christopher didn’t say anything to me about being unhappy in the first place. And then his keeping the secret of the affair…it was awful. As I hear you talking, I can feel myself reliving my own pain and trying to protect myself from it—and I guess that I want to protect you, too.” Then she added, “If only Christopher and I had gone to couples therapy way back at the beginning of it all. I’m glad we eventually did—otherwise we probably wouldn’t be married anymore.”

 “I hear how hard Christopher’s affair was and still is for you,” Mia said. “But does this mean you can’t be here for me to just talk things through with?”

By now Aniyah had stopped crying. “I want you to feel like you can talk to me. But what if you take my support of you as support of an affair? Then it would be like I’m supporting Christopher in having had one. I hate this feeling, and I don’t know what to do.”

Aniyah and Mia are close to having an exceptional relationship. They are increasingly open with each other, honest in their reactions, supportive, and able to raise disagreements. But Aniyah is in a tough spot. Mia’s issue struck a raw nerve in her.

It’s not hard to imagine this happening in many relationships. Perhaps you’re afraid of being laid off, and your best friend has just been fired. Or you just learned that your mother has a terminal illness, but your friend has suddenly lost a parent. Or you’re having a hard time adjusting to parenthood, but your friend hasn’t been able to get pregnant. It might be that the similarity allows the other to be especially empathetic and understanding, but they might find it traumatic. No matter how close the relationship, it’s legitimate to say, “I’m sorry; I really want to help, but this is just too painful for me.” Otherwise close relationships can feel coercive.

There are other possibilities, depending on the level of emotional distress. One solution is what Aniyah did, which was to acknowledge and name her feelings. She recognized early in their conversation that she couldn’t be objective and said so. That helped Mia hear what Aniyah said more clearly.

Aniyah could go on to say, “Mia, this is going to be hard for me, but I think I can empathize with your feelings if you don’t hear that as implicitly supporting your having an affair. I want to be able to raise my reactions as my concerns and not have you hear them as admonishment. And maybe expressing my worries can give you a different perspective through the consequences and options.”

 A third option is for Aniyah to focus on the initial issue: Mia’s unhappiness. Even though Aniyah did some preliminary exploration of that the first time Mia expressed her discontent, she in essence shut it down with the logical argument that life isn’t all roses. Instead, she could have continued to be curious, to help Mia reflect on the deeper issues behind her moroseness. Focusing on the underlying problem opens up multiple solutions to explore beyond the possibility of pursuing the affair with Tyler.

As Aniyah and Mia moved forward, Aniyah chose elements of all three approaches.





Mia and Aniyah, Part 5


Aniyah was committed to being there as much as she could for her friend and told her so, which Mia appreciated. During their subsequent conversations, Aniyah did her best to help Mia explore the issues behind her unhappiness. She helped Mia examine her options, as well as think about the consequences and potential outcomes of going ahead with an affair. As difficult as it was, Aniyah worked hard to separate her own issues from her friend’s proposed solution. That gave her a chance to help Mia explore what an affair meant without Aniyah’s having to imply approval.

One afternoon, Mia mused, “Even if Jake knew about it, I don’t think a brief affair with Tyler would end my marriage. But does he have to know? Don’t a lot of people have little adventures on the side?”

“Well, yeah, you might be able to keep it a secret, but what does that do to your marriage?” Aniyah pressed. “Does that really bring you closer to Jake? And if he does find out, what does that do to future trust? I have to admit, every so often, even now, I feel uneasy when Christopher talks about a female colleague. Is it really worth introducing that uncertainty into your marriage? Plus, what happens if you end up falling in love with Tyler? What then? If your intention is to remain married, aren’t you better off figuring out what you want from Jake?”

 Aniyah could see Mia struggle with her questions. Mia listened but was resistant to giving up on the idea of a tryst with Tyler. They continued to explore what the underlying issues were. Aniyah asked Mia what she wanted with Jake and what else she could do to get it.

A few bumpy moments cropped up as they continued to talk over the following week. One was when Aniyah reverted to giving Mia advice and warned, “You really need to stop…You’re playing with fire.” Mia responded that the comment wasn’t helpful, and they got back on track.

At another point Aniyah said with exasperation, “You’re not thinking clearly, and I can’t believe you’re even considering this!”

Mia was a bit taken aback and then said, “That’s hurtful, Aniyah. I don’t feel supported or understood. Instead, I feel judged.”

“I’m sorry you feel judged,” responded Aniyah. “While that is not my intent, I do think it is important for me to be direct with you so that you know what I think and feel. I think that is my responsibility as your friend.” They once again returned to the topic at hand.

Aniyah and Mia went back and forth exploring these issues in increasing depth, but at a certain point, they reached an impasse. Eventually, Aniyah said, “I’m not sure I can help you any more than I have. I’m not a professional therapist and there are too many things about this that trigger me, no matter how hard I work at keeping them at bay. Even though I can’t keep talking about this, I hope you know how much I care for you and how special our relationship is to me.”

To which Mia responded, “Yes, I do.”

 Even in exceptional relationships, not every issue can be resolved. But it is possible that dealing with an impasse such as the one these two friends face can further strengthen the bonds between them and cement their friendship at an exceptional level. They achieved this by not blaming each other for the situation. Yes, Mia said, “Does this mean you can’t be here for me to just talk things through with?” But that was a question and very different than if she’d aggressively demanded, “Why can’t you be there for me?” Likewise, Aniyah didn’t say, “How dare you expect me to support you when this is so painful?”

Second, each of them disclosed a great deal: Mia in sharing how important it was for her to feel alive again and how much she needed Aniyah, and Aniyah in telling Mia about Christopher’s affair and all that went on with her during that time. And finally, even though Aniyah was in pain, she continued to be there for Mia. That continued effort decreased the chance that Mia would conclude that her close friend didn’t care.

Just because you have an exceptional relationship doesn’t mean that you have to agree to the other person’s every request. It is important to balance two needs. One is to take care of yourself and the other is to be responsive to the other person. That is especially important in the face of entangled issues. The way that Mia and Aniyah handled this challenge provides clues as to how to manage that tension. The key is in being open about your needs, being concerned about the other person’s needs, and having that conversation without blame.





Three Additional Considerations


WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMPATHY AND AGREEMENT?


Aniyah wanted to be empathetic and understanding, even if she could not support Mia’s proposed solution to her unhappiness. It was a hard line to walk. It required they both be clear that Aniyah’s empathy did not imply support for an affair.

 A friend of ours, Eve, faced a similar challenge with her father. Alfredo frequently alienated family members and heard all feedback as an attack. Eve tried to connect with him by empathizing with his unhappiness, but he interpreted her empathy as agreeing with his position that he was being mistreated by his family. He always insisted his intentions were good. When Eve tried to point out that it was behavior, not intentions, that affected others, he heard that as just another attack. She didn’t know how to get out of that bind. When the other person wants agreement, empathetic understanding may not work. Eve had to accept that what her father wanted she could not give. The cost was a greater distance between them than either of them would have wished for.





WHAT IF SUPPORT VIOLATES MY VALUES?


Aniyah was opposed to Mia’s plans less on values grounds and more on the costs that she had personally experienced. But what if she believed that affairs were sinful? Can one truly “hate the sin, but love the sinner”? Would Mia have felt as fully supported by that approach? Pope Francis, when asked about his views on homosexuality, replied, “Who am I to judge?” But when you have strong value beliefs, and you’re not Pope Francis, how easy is it not to judge?

If Aniyah had strong values about extramarital affairs, and Mia knew that, it is unlikely Mia would have come to her for support. We don’t share all issues with one exceptional friend; that’s why most of us need more than one.





WHAT IF I’M CROSSING THE LINE AND ACTING LIKE A THERAPIST?


Aniyah encouraged Mia to explore the source of her dissatisfaction with her life and her marriage. She asked open-ended questions to encourage her friend to reflect more deeply about the causes of her unhappiness and consider other possibilities for addressing it. She tried to be nonjudgmental and eventually accepted the fact that Mia knew best what worked for her. But there is only so much a nonprofessional can do, and Aniyah knew her limitations. When Aniyah said, “I’m not sure I can help you any more than I have. I’m not a professional therapist,” she was not abdicating her role as a close friend or being judgmental; she was acknowledging her own limits. That said, you can’t force someone into therapy. Though Aniyah told Mia how therapy had helped her and Christopher in a similar situation, Mia ultimately rejected the idea. At that point, Aniyah had done all she could.

—

 An intimate talk with one person may open doors that can no longer be kept shut with another—for better or worse. In this way, one exceptional relationship can impact another. Aniyah thought that Christopher’s past affair had been laid to rest but came to recognize that there were residual feelings beneath the surface, which might reopen a discussion with her husband about further repairs their relationship needed.

There is a potentially double-edged sword to conversations like this. Yes, maybe Aniyah and Christopher ultimately would gain from what Aniyah’s conversation with Mia brought up, but Aniyah wasn’t looking to have a painful issue brought back to life. Once two people wade into entangled issues, there may be no option but to continue to move forward and deal with them—whether anticipated or not, welcomed or not. Which brings us back to a central tenet of this book: the importance of a learning mindset.

Let’s assume that Aniyah is stirred up about Christopher’s past affair. It’s likely that he will not be pleased to be reminded of his dalliance. But if Aniyah can move beyond blame (“How could you have done this to me!”) and into exploration (“What do I need in order to find more peace?” or “Where are we now in our relationship?”), there is the possibility for rich learning for both of them. It won’t be easy, but it is another choice point.

 This is part of what makes exceptional relationships so magical—the experience of being fully known and accepted by another, the chance to be fully human and see the other in the same way, and the chance to learn. It is not easy, but it’s part of living a full life.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Imagine you are Aniyah. How would you have handled the situation she was in with Mia? How might you have conveyed your reticence to discuss Mia’s issue without her feeling rejected or the relationship’s suffering?



Entangled Personally: Have you been in a situation where a close friend/family member/colleague wanted to discuss an issue they were facing with you, but it stirred up strong personal feelings for you? How did you handle it?



Entangling Others: Have you been in a situation where you wanted to talk about an issue, but you were uncertain that it would be okay with the other person? For example, perhaps you had a parent who was fading, and your friend had recently lost a parent who had dementia. Maybe your friend welcomed sharing the experience—but maybe not. Whatever the situation was, how did you handle it? Are there aspects of it you wish you’d handled differently?



Present Dilemma: Do you currently have a situation in which you want to talk about an issue that might trigger the other person?





APPLICATION


Check out whether there is a way to discuss the issues with the person you identified in self-reflection question 4. How can you have that discussion in a way that allows the other person to decline without making either of you feel rejected?





MAKING SENSE


This discussion required a combination of being forthright and sensitive. How did it go? What did you learn about yourself and about this process? How did taking this risk impact your relationship?
