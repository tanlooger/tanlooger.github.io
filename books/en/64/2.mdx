title: 2 A WORLD-CLASS COURSE, ONE CHAPTER AT A TIME
---






We know what Interpersonal Dynamics has delivered to generations of students. We’ve turned to the skills we teach time and time again when helping others deal with relationship challenges and when dealing with our own. Our students have urged us repeatedly to put the class material in book form so that they can refer back to it or share it with their friends, spouse, or business partners. Beyond that, we have a personal dream of bringing the benefits of this course to many thousands of people beyond Stanford and have long pondered the question of how to make these lessons available more widely.

There are challenges. The course this book is based on relies on close, experiential learning with a small group of students. Each student is committed to being in the same face-to-face group for ten weeks, so even if the going gets tough, there’s no quitting. Conflicts work out in the groups as people get to see more nuanced sides of one another. Second, students get assistance from others in the group. If an interaction between two people doesn’t go well, others step in and say, “Hey. What’s going on here?” or “I’m feeling protective of Gabriel and want to make sure he’s doing okay.” And third, the class has cultural norms that support learning, including confidentiality and the idea that the only mistake is refusing to learn from our mistakes. The latter reframes problems as learning opportunities.

These three factors certainly don’t exist in a book. Yes, we can provide the same concepts, stories, and material covered in our lectures and readings, but we can’t provide a group of eleven other peers to support your learning and keep you engaged. And we can’t influence the cultural norms of your particular relationships. We like to think of ourselves as a pretty capable duo, but even so, we have our limits. There’s also the challenge of helping you convert a conceptual understanding into actual behavior. After all, it’s possible to know what to do without being able to actually do it. With experiential learning, you try something first and then learn about it.

So for this to work, first and foremost, we need your active involvement. In our classes, we say that those who sit back and observe will gain the least, while those who roll up their sleeves and really engage with one another will learn the most. In this book, we have created five scenarios that run throughout, each featuring two people at an inflection point in their relationship. The pairs we feature cover a wide gamut—from a daughter trying to change a decades-old way of relating with her father, to a married couple weighing their shared responsibilities against their individual needs, to work colleagues whose relationship is deepened and tested over time. All cases are an amalgamation of real relationships we have had or seen, and we ask that rather than reading the book passively, you work to imagine yourself in each situation.

In reading of their travails and putting yourself in their places, reflect on how you would feel and act. What does that say about what you do well and how you might limit yourself? Are there some competencies you need to develop? Then, when we describe ways that these situations could be handled, assess how easy that would be for you and what would be challenging. Explore what insights you can gain about yourself from your reactions. Taking an active stance will help you personalize the material.

Second, put what you’re learning into practice. Each chapter ends with self-reflection questions and suggestions for ways to apply your learning. Take the time you need between chapters to use these lessons, just as our students do between classes. Putting this material to work is not simple. You’ll notice that in lieu of solid answers, we often give you options, because the specific solutions depend on you—on the sort of outcome you want, on your abilities, and on the risks you’re willing to take.

Since relationships are co-determined, the right course of action also depends on the other person: What do they want? What can they handle? What’s the context for the relationship? Instead of being constraining, this kind of flexibility is liberating. Though there’s no guarantee you’ll always succeed in getting the connections you want, you can learn from trying. In fact, if we had our druthers, you would read a single chapter, apply its lessons to your life, and then read the chapter again.

Third, fine-tune two crucial personal “antennae.” One of these needs to look outward, and the other needs to focus inward. If you only have the latter, you can’t understand the other person, and if only the former, you lose yourself. In listening to both, you are more likely to act in ways that best fit the situation and your collective needs. Keeping those antennae highly tuned will help you see every interaction with another person as an opportunity to learn. A friend of ours has suggested the Stanford course should actually be called Interpersonal Mindfulness, because in order to engage with another in the ways we describe throughout the book, you have to become acutely aware of what’s going on for you as well as for the other.

No, we’re not grading you. But stick with it anyway.





The Arc of Relationships—and of This Book


All relationships vary, but most develop in a similar pattern. They often start with a common interest, like music or hiking. At other times, people might have complementary interests—one likes to make plans and initiate activities, while the other finds it a chore. In this process, the two must learn how to relate to and influence each other. To what extent can the second person say no to plans the first suggests? To what extent can the first state when they are feeling used and push some of the scheduling responsibility onto the second?

 This might be as far as you go with some people, and that’s perfectly fine. For example, let’s say you and a buddy both like basketball and have built an easy friendship, and that’s enough of a bond for an enjoyable game every other weekend. Usually you talk about movies and current events (with certain contentious topics avoided), and that’s satisfying to you both. In this relationship, neither of you feels the need to discuss your deepest worries or biggest dreams. As we said in chapter 1, not every friendship needs to be the equivalent of chocolate soufflé.

However, there are relationships that you want to take deeper. You move past these initial stages of getting to know each other and begin to communicate more openly and personally. As you do, mutual knowledge and understanding grow and you find more areas in which to connect. As trust builds, you’re each increasingly willing to take risks about what you disclose, becoming even more vulnerable. The cycle continues and is reinforced, and the relationship develops. This deeper relationship allows you to discuss issues like difficulties at work or conflicts with your teenager that you wouldn’t raise with a more casual friend.

As you become more important to each other, the relationship also becomes increasingly complex. Obligations and expectations build, as do potential points of contention. How will you deal with inevitable annoyances? If you can face and resolve them well, the relationship becomes even stronger. That in turn encourages each of you to surface what you want from the other and what’s getting in the way. Openness and honesty grow. As the healthy relationship develops, you avoid power imbalances, so that you each get roughly the same amount of satisfaction.

 As you negotiate your evolving relationship, you each learn how to influence the other. You build interdependence that makes it easy to ask for help when you need it and to turn it down when it’s not useful. Challenges and conflict don’t go away, but you know how to deal with them. When a relationship reaches this stage, each person can be of great support to the other. You can discuss issues openly, give and receive feedback, and grow as a result.

However, if the relationship is to progress even further, you have to significantly increase your level of disclosure and risk-taking. There is even greater risk since you both now have skin in the game. Sometimes the relationship deepens and reaches exceptional almost seamlessly, through years of joyful shared experiences, layered disclosures, and ever-increasing trust. But in most cases, one or more critical issues transform it. Let’s suppose a major conflict emerges with the potential to tear the fabric of the relationship. You might decide it’s better to let sleeping dogs lie and avoid the issue altogether. The relationship survives but plateaus. Facing the issue tests the relationship and might end it. But fully resolving the conflict strengthens the connection—you are moving toward exceptional territory.

Deep relationships take time—there is no instant intimacy. You can influence the speed and direction of a relationship’s trajectory—and we’ll show you some ways to do just that. But it takes two to tango, and so what develops in a relationship will also depend on the other person, including their willingness and ability to take these steps toward growth. You may be able to influence that, but you can’t control it. The arc of development also isn’t necessarily linear. A relationship may stay where it is for a while or even regress and then start growing again.

This book is structured to follow the rough arc of deepening relationships and is divided into two parts. In part I, we examine the six hallmarks of exceptional relationships described in the first chapter. These concepts are key to all functional, robust relationships, whether they end up becoming exceptional or not. We talk about how to be more fully yourself and how to help others do the same. We cover the question of balance in a relationship and mutual influence. We examine how to deal with minor annoyances and more significant disagreements, and we ask what gets in the way of offering and hearing feedback. We explore the knotty question of whether people can change, and we look at the role curiosity plays in resolving conflicts.

 In part II, we look at how relationships transition from very good to exceptional. What does it take to successfully resolve a major conflict and, in the process, deepen the connection? How do you set boundaries while still remaining close? We also look at the issue of entanglement, which can happen when personal issues for one person trigger pain for another. While not all relationships need to be tested to become exceptional, we’ve found that it’s often in the testing stage that bonds become deeper and individuals become more skilled at forging and maintaining them.

When a relationship doesn’t reach exceptional status, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed, and it doesn’t mean the relationship will never be exceptional. How to handle this tricky territory is the subject of chapter 16. And finally, the last chapter of the book discusses how our own relationship faced a crisis that almost ended it and how we pulled all of the learning in this book together to not only salvage what we had but deepen it. It was scary, and it is humbling to admit that even we who teach this stuff could so thoroughly screw up.





A Learning Mindset


Reportedly, as the French Impressionist painter Auguste Renoir lay dying at seventy-eight, his last words were, “I think I’m beginning to learn something about it.” What a wonderful, open, exploratory mind. We have our own, saltier take on the same idea. Whenever we face challenges, we think, “Well, that’s an AFOG”—which is short for “another f**king opportunity for growth.”

We cannot stress enough how important such a learning mindset is, whether you go with Renoir’s words or with ours. You can’t significantly develop a relationship (and certainly can’t reach exceptional) unless you’re open to learning. This mindset isn’t limited to new skills and competencies but also applies to a willingness to look within. In the 1970s there was a cartoon character, Pogo, who said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” It’s easy to blame another when things go wrong, but it’s necessary to also be willing to reflect on whether part of the enemy “is us.”

 A learning mindset has several characteristics. One is a willingness to let go of the idea that your way of doing things is always best. Another is being game to try new things and take the risk of making mistakes. And a third is seeing mistakes as learning opportunities rather than something to be embarrassed about and hide. Curiosity is key. Thinking, I wonder why this isn’t working, is much more productive than blaming another person when something goes awry.

Having an open mind for continuous learning is a wonderful way to live. It means you’re open to your own development, which includes acquiring the skills and competencies this book describes, reflecting on assumptions you hold that might limit you, and reconsidering behaviors that aren’t serving you well. As Alan Alda said, “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off, every once in a while, or the light won’t come in.” Some changes might be relatively easy to make, and some might be very challenging, but it’s all part of the magic of relationships.

When the going gets tough, there’s a temptation to say, “I can’t. That’s not me.” True, that may not be you now, but can it never be you? Perhaps it’s not you yet, as described by psychologist Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindsets. None of the skills and competencies we suggest are so esoteric that they can’t be acquired. We say that with certainty because we have seen so many participants in the Interpersonal Dynamics course make the “I can’t” disclaimer, only to learn the competencies by the end of the term. In every case, their mindset had to first shift from “I can’t” to “I see I have a choice, even though it’s hard.” And while it is legitimate for different people to make different choices, we must all acknowledge we’ve made a choice.

 This is hard work, no doubt. But it’s worth it. Good luck, and may you make many rich learning mistakes.





Introduction to Deepen Your Learning


To make the material in this book personally relevant, your first task is to select four or five relationships—with family, friends, or work colleagues—that you would like to significantly deepen. At the end of each chapter you will find a recurring “Self-Reflection” section in which we ask you to consider how the chapter content relates to those relationships. Regardless of what category of relationship you choose, keep in mind that the lessons learned in each chapter apply across all of them. In the recurring “Application” sections, we suggest ways to apply the material toward making those relationships stronger.

We encourage you to share your goals with the people you have chosen so that they have some context and understand why you will be asking them for help. You may want to stress that you see this as an opportunity to make the relationship you already value even stronger rather than only a learning opportunity for you. Hopefully, they will join you in your learning journey.

The third recurring section, “Making Sense,” asks you to reflect on what you learned from “doing.” Experiences have the most value when you try to make sense out of them. We’ll ask you, as we ask our students, What was it like applying the concepts to a key relationship? What did you learn about yourself and about building stronger connections?





SELF-REFLECTION


The first chapter listed the following six characteristics of an exceptional relationship:

You can be more fully yourself, and so can the other person.



Both of you are willing to be vulnerable.



You trust that self-disclosures will not be used against you.



You can be honest with each other.



You deal with conflict productively.



Both of you are committed to each other’s growth and development.





Take each of the key relationships that you have selected. For each one:

Which one(s) of these six characteristics is strongest?



Which one(s) of these six would you most want to improve on?



What is it about what you (not the other person) do—or don’t do—that contributes to the limitations you identified?





APPLICATION


Take one of the people you selected and initiate a conversation about what you would like from the relationship. Share your assessment from the self-reflection exercise above (including what you think you do and don’t do), and find out whether they assess you, themselves, and the situation the same way.





MAKING SENSE


How did it go? What did you learn about yourself and about how you raise issues? How receptive were you to the other person’s comments?

 In this chapter, we covered some of the ways we block our learning. Did any of those limitations come up for you? What did you learn about the process of building stronger relationships?

Note: You might want to consider keeping a journal of what you learn from the “Deepen Your Learning” activities throughout the book. You will be returning to these relationships in subsequent chapters, and it will be interesting to see how they develop. Our students are required to keep a journal throughout the course, and while many of them hate it at the time, most thank us afterward!





CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN


As a teenager and into his twenties, David spent summer vacations near the White Mountains in northern New Hampshire and would frequently climb Mount Washington, in the Presidential Range. Its multiple trails made it his favorite destination, but it’s also a dangerous mountain. Although not the hardest ascent in North America, it holds the record for the most fatalities, as its sudden climate changes in the middle of the summer leave many weekend climbers unprepared. It might be a beautiful, warm, clear day, but in a matter of minutes clouds can sweep in, suddenly dropping the temperature and making it difficult to see the next trail marker. David would never climb alone, partially because he liked having company but also because he never knew when he might need help.

Climbing Mount Washington with a partner is akin to building an exceptional relationship. Relationships begin on an easy, well-worn trail of light conversation. Soon the climb becomes a bit more challenging, and you begin to have options. The trail splits and you disagree about which fork to take, a disagreement that requires resolution. Then you’re at the difficult, steep headwall, and the choices multiply. How much should you offer to help your partner? Will they welcome the offer or be insulted? What if you want to take a break but your partner doesn’t?

It’s exhilarating as you climb together over the headwall. A beautiful meadow lies before you with summer flowers. You lay your knapsacks down so you can rest and take in what you have accomplished. You could decide to just stay there and enjoy each other’s company. The boulders look bigger ahead, the climb more demanding.

All five pairs we’ll meet in the next ten chapters of the book arrive at the meadow, each in their own way. What they achieve is huge—they find their way to more robust and meaningful relationships, and as individuals, they have learned and grown. All relationships have to get here first, before they have any hope of reaching the summit of becoming exceptional. Some will remain at the meadow, and some will go on. But make no mistake—even getting to the meadow will be challenging, though rewarding.
