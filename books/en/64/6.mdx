Elena and Sanjay, Part 3


Jessica has a strong relationship with her brother Ryan. They’re both single and live in the same city. They have busy, independent lives but have always enjoyed each other’s company. Jessica has traditionally been the one more likely to initiate calls to catch up and suggest getting together after work for a drink or dinner. But in the last few months, she’s begun to feel a tad resentful that she’s the only one making these overtures; it used to feel more balanced. She knows Ryan is really busy with a new job and is at an age where he has a bachelor party or a wedding to attend on many weekends, so she doesn’t say anything. He’s always receptive when she reaches out, so she continues to do so, and she doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it. Yet every time she calls him, she is a little more annoyed that she’s the one who had to make the initial effort. Eventually, her annoyance grows into anger and hurt.

One Friday she calls him to suggest they catch a movie after work, and he says he’s sorry, but he’s just too busy with a report he has to finish up. Jessica explodes. “It’s bad enough you’re never the one to reach out to get together, but now, on top of that, you can’t even make the time to grab a couple of hours with me. Obviously, you don’t care much about our relationship anymore.”

“I don’t know why you’re making such a big deal out of this,” Ryan replies, surprised. “When did you become so needy? Our relationship used to be so easy. When you guilt-trip me, it makes me want to hang out even less.”

Jessica concludes she would have been better off not raising any of this in the first place. However, had she raised it before her annoyance grew into anger, she might have been able to avoid a big blowup, saying something like “Hey, Ryan, it’s starting to piss me off that I’m the one who always initiates getting together, and I want to raise that before it turns into a big deal. I know you’re super busy. I want to respect that and also share that it doesn’t feel good to be the one who always has to reach out first.”

People often claim, as Jessica did, that they withhold critical feedback out of kindness, for the sake of the other person. But is it really for the other’s sake or for our own? In this situation, Jessica was initially more annoyed than Ryan. How does keeping him in the dark help him or the relationship? And if not reciprocating is a pattern he exhibits with others, how does it help him for her not to raise the issue?

One of the ways that Jessica trapped herself was that she didn’t pay enough attention to her growing frustration. Instead, she downplayed her emotions, something people do all the time. But there is truth in the adage “Own your feelings or they will own you.”

In the language of Interpersonal Dynamics, we’d say that Jessica initially felt a “pinch”—a shorthand way of saying, “Hey, this isn’t a capital offense, but it’s bothering me.” Pinches are inevitable in any relationship. For example, when someone makes a joke that you believe is slightly at your expense, do you raise the issue or, in the spirit of being a “good sport,” laugh along with the others? Or say you’ve done a favor for another person and don’t think that they’ve fully acknowledged your effort. Do you say something, or will they just see it as petty? Or perhaps you’ve shared something personal, but the other person didn’t pick up on it, and you feel a bit let down. These aren’t major conflicts; some of them pass, but others get under your skin and, if not dealt with, can grow into sizable problems—what we’d call a “crunch.”

When a relationship first develops, both parties are on their best behavior. But as they get to know each other, one person inevitably does something that rubs the other the wrong way. Each of us has our own style of relating, of raising and resolving issues, and, in an organizational setting, of getting work done. These differences could be compatible. Or, well, not. It’s a dilemma: You want to be more fully yourself, but what if being yourself causes problems with someone else?

Interpersonal issues are inevitable, a normal part of building and maintaining relationships. But as this chapter will show, it’s easier to raise problems before they develop into major conflicts. For example, the two of us were working on a big project when David took some time to visit his grandchildren. Carole expressed frustration at having to wait for him to reply to some of her questions so that she could continue making progress while he was away. David felt a pinch, given the number of times he had patiently waited for Carole to carve out time for their project as she was launching her startup. It would have been easy for David to keep his annoyance buried, but he knew that the issue could fester. Instead, David told Carole that he felt a pinch from her comments. David’s open communication helped raise the issue in a productive way: Carole acknowledged her own impatience, apologized, and expressed her appreciation for all the times David had picked up the slack. David told Carole she was a great partner, she reciprocated, and they got back to work.

When pinches are caught early, neither party is likely to be emotionally hooked. But when an annoyance is left to fester, once it’s finally brought up, it’s often grown bigger than the precipitating event and it can lead to multiple issues becoming intertwined. Let’s say that your partner has been a bit forgetful of late, which you have found annoying. But each time, the pinch was minor, so you didn’t say anything. Then they come home having forgotten the milk they said they’d buy, and you get into a fight, ostensibly over the milk. But the issue isn’t the milk—it’s a proxy for built-up annoyance.

Recently, David had a similar placeholder issue with his wife, Eva. He was in the kitchen making a cup of coffee and was about to leave when Eva said (with some heat), “Why did you leave the dirty spoon on the counter? Can’t you put it away?” It would have been easy for him to say, “What’s the big deal about one lousy spoon? And anyway, I clean up a lot of things.”

Fortunately, he didn’t, because the issue wasn’t the dirty spoon. Rather, it was about what it stood for. Eva had just cleaned up the kitchen. Not only had David not expressed appreciation, but the cavalier way he had put a dirty spoon down had been taken by Eva as a sign that he was treating her like the scullery maid. It was only when they got to the real issue—how much each expressed (or didn’t express) appreciation to the other—that they could have a productive discussion.





Elena and Sanjay, Part 3


Elena and Sanjay continued their lunches just about every week and got to know each other even better. Sometimes they talked about personal interests, but mostly they talked about work and changes in the company. These were affirming conversations for Elena, and her continued job success led to a significant increase in self-confidence. She didn’t dwell on what happened at her old company anymore.

Sanjay was increasingly impressed with Elena’s ability to see the larger picture instead of getting trapped in narrow departmental points of view. So, when Sanjay was promoted to take over the Latin America market, he asked Elena, who had grown up in Mexico, to come work for him. He not only valued her background and perspective but also didn’t want Heather, who worked for him, to be the only woman on the seven-member team.

Elena found the new role exciting and the team meetings generally rewarding. The issues were important to her, and she joined in the conversations wholeheartedly. Sanjay had stressed from the start that he wanted all team members to “take the larger perspective” and “hold each other accountable to ensure the best results.” Elena found taking this larger view easy to do, but other members had a harder time and frequently responded from their functional point of view.

 Elena was perplexed that Sanjay didn’t call them on this tendency. Having observed this repeatedly, she finally decided to comment after one of the members grew particularly protective of his area. “We need to take a bigger view and consider the larger purpose as opposed to being parochial,” she said. The group went silent for a moment and the offending member nodded. When nobody else said anything, the conversation moved on. In spite of the silence that had followed her comment, Elena felt good about speaking up and noted that in subsequent discussions, more of the other members considered the broader perspective.

A week later, at one of their Thursday lunches, Sanjay said, “Now that you work for me, I’m concerned that the rest of the team might feel excluded by our lunch meetings and think that we’re discussing the project and even making decisions. How about opening these lunches up to everybody?” Although Elena felt a twinge of loss, she appreciated his concern for how the team members might be feeling, so she agreed. Not all members joined them on Thursdays, but most of them did, and the camaraderie of the team increased.

Meanwhile, other dynamics of the team meetings began to bother Elena. Even though she liked the informal tone and friendly bantering, sometimes the humor had a bit of an edge to it. I wish people would be more direct, she thought, but decided to let it pass. What bothered her more was that, not infrequently, she would make a comment to which there was no response, yet five minutes later, one of the men would make the same point and others would pick up on it and run with it, with no acknowledgment that she had made it first. This was especially true with Steven, who seemed to have a hard time hearing her ideas but would nonetheless make the same suggestions shortly afterward. What especially galled Elena was that even Sanjay, from whom she would have expected more given his sensitivity, seemed to pay more attention when a male team member made a comment that she had previously made.

 One day, walking out of a meeting with Heather where this had occurred yet again, she asked her if she’d noticed it. “Of course,” Heather replied, and shrugged. In a somewhat resigned tone, she added, “But what do you expect? And the men interrupt us much more than they do each other. That’s just the way the world is.”

Elena wasn’t satisfied with this conclusion, nor was she prepared to simply accept the status quo. Also, Sanjay’s behavior particularly bothered her: Since he was their leader, she expected more from him. She’d thought he understood gender issues and anticipated that he would have pointed out this unhealthy pattern in the meeting. She was hesitant about raising her concerns with the group, lest they see her as “too sensitive.” She was also concerned about talking to Sanjay about the problem for fear he would think she was using their friendship to ask for something special. Oh well, she thought, it really isn’t such a big deal. I’ll just let it go.

That didn’t turn out to be so easy. When the pattern repeated itself in subsequent meetings, it bothered Elena more and more. Then the Latin America group gave a progress report to the executive committee, and one of the vice presidents was especially complimentary about an angle they’d taken. Sanjay said, “Yes, we feel very good about that recommendation.” Elena thought, That was primarily my idea and I had to push hard for it; it certainly would have been nice to have been acknowledged for it. As they left the room, Elena walked next to Sanjay and quietly made her point. “We’re a team,” he replied, “and I need everybody to take a team perspective.”





Why We Don’t Raise Pinches


People are often hesitant to raise pinches out of concern that doing so might make them seem thin-skinned and petty. You probably know someone who can take affront at the smallest comment, and you don’t want to be like them. Or you may think, It’s just not worth it. Sometimes that’s true, but sometimes if you dig deeper, you’ll find it’s more important to you than you initially realized. Try this: Change the first pronoun to “I” or “you,” as in, I’m just not worth it or You’re just not worth it. Do you still think the issue isn’t worth raising? Sometimes you may, but often you realize there are more feelings there than you first recognized.

Many people are also hesitant to raise pinches out of concern that speaking up might make things worse. Will your complaint cause the other to retaliate? Will it trigger a bunch of other issues? Or do you hold back because you see the relationship—or the other person—as fragile? When this comes up in class, we ask the student, “If a friend of yours felt pinched by a comment you made, would you want them to tell you?” Almost universally, the student says yes. We add, “So, if you want that, wouldn’t you want to do that for them when you’re pinched?”

A final reason we resist raising pinches early on is that we assume the other meant no harm. We think, If they didn’t mean to bother me, why should I be bothered? That rationalization may have worked the first time that Steven repeated Elena’s unacknowledged point, but it was still a rationalization. As we will explore in the next chapter, there’s a difference between another’s intent and the effect of their behavior. That Elena was bothered was true in and of itself—her feeling didn’t need a justification to exist.

The likelihood that Steven didn’t mean anything by it could actually make it easier to raise the pinch. Let’s say that in a meeting Steven twice picked up Elena’s idea without acknowledging the source. Could she, as the two of them walked out afterward, lightly say, “Thanks for picking up my ideas that got ignored, Steven. But I’d have liked if you’d acknowledged that I raised them first”? Steven would be likely to respond, “Sorry, didn’t realize that I’d done that.” And Elena could add, “I thought that might have been the case.” The pinch is noted, acknowledged, and settled.

 If Elena is only pinched, she can say this lightly. If she waited until she was more upset and expressed the same sentiment through clenched teeth, Steven would more likely hear it as an attack. But because she raised it early, Elena is likely to feel better, and Steven might be more aware of what he is doing that she finds problematic. If he continues to repeat her comments without acknowledgment, she now has a basis to bring it up again, but more strongly.

Many pinches do go away, but ask yourself, Will this pinch linger? Connect to other issues? Trigger a major fight about missing milk rather than what’s really going on?

Once a pinch grows this way, it threatens to become a crunch. Crunches are much more problematic than pinches, because in addition to the likelihood that much stronger feelings now exist, you’re also more likely to have developed a negative story about the other person. Elena wasn’t there yet but was getting close, so it was wise that she raised her issue with Sanjay as they left the meeting, even though Sanjay didn’t respond as she’d hoped.

As pinches grow into crunches, we begin to develop a story that is likely to include negative assumptions about the other person. Take Elena’s pinch with Steven. She doesn’t know him well, but his rather frequent tendency to “steal” her ideas (as Elena sees it) is likely to lead her to question his motives and character. It will become easy for her to construct narratives about him. He has trouble with strong women. He likes to be the center of attention. He needs frequent affirmation from authority. None of these theories—even if never stated—are likely to help her build a positive relationship with this key colleague.

Furthermore, once we have developed a negative story, we have a tendency to selectively collect data, or, as we like to think of it, “build a case that supports our view.” The truth is, regardless of how objective you think you are, everyone is subject to confirmation bias. When you develop a belief, or even a hunch, you have a tendency to pay more attention to incidents that support it and discount any that are disconfirming. Elena will likely be especially aware of further cases where her ideas are ignored and then restated by others, especially Steven. Likewise, she will be cued to watch for times when she thinks that Sanjay is ignoring her or downplaying her contribution to the team. She will also be less likely to notice when she is being heard, acknowledged, or appreciated by either of them.





But Is It Funny? The Use of Humor in Raising Pinches


Let’s imagine that Elena, rather than talking to Steven after the meeting, has had it with his “stealing” her ideas and in the meeting says, “Great point, Steven, and just what I said five minutes ago. I guess one needs a deep voice to be heard here.” Even if it were said with a smile and light voice, how might that land? On the one hand, it could be a net positive. Everybody, including Steven, laughs, and he acknowledges her point. He (and others) stop doing it and Elena’s contributions are heard.

Humor works in these situations precisely because of its power to help people connect. Victor Borge once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” Sharing a joke or a funny comment can bring us closer to one another. It can lighten the mood and lift our spirits. When we banter and kid around, we not only get to know one another better but also experience a special kind of freedom. As our colleagues Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas’s research suggests, “Laughter makes us more physically resilient to tensions and stressors…facilitates social bonding and increases trust. When people laugh together at work, relationships improve, and people feel more valued and trusted.” In the best-case scenario, Elena’s joke would improve her standing with her colleagues and increase her team’s cohesion.

 On the other hand, humor rarely works if the joke is at one person’s expense or is an indirect way of saying something that isn’t funny at all. And Elena doesn’t know how her jab might land with Steven. It might be more than a pinch to him if he feels embarrassed at being put down in front of his colleagues. Even if he doesn’t take exception, maybe he, and others, would hear it only as a joke, resulting in the message’s getting lost. Even if the message got through, it could increase the distance between the two of them as he guards himself against possible future zingers and she guards against possible retaliation. It’s unlikely to encourage him to be vulnerable. And it’s possible this humorous comment would send a message that being indirect is how Elena and others want annoyances expressed—when, in fact, this tendency is something that Elena has found frustrating about the team.

Humor can also be a shield to hide behind if the other takes affront. What if Steven were to respond by saying, “That’s snide; what’s going on?” That could be an opening for an authentic conversation in which Elena directly states her feelings. But what if she says, “Oh, can’t you take a joke?” Now she has put him down twice. Not only is the issue not dealt with, but whatever trust there was between them has been lost. Furthermore, this may not help Elena’s reputation as a direct, trustworthy person with other colleagues.

The problem with using humor to convey a message is its inherent ambiguity. It’s unclear exactly how upset Elena is at Steven’s tendency to repeat her ideas. Is she really annoyed or only slightly pinched? And there is ambiguity in what Steven hears and how he takes it. It’s better, especially if you’re concerned about the relationship, to have the sort of direct conversation that Elena could have if she mentioned her concerns to Steven as they were leaving the meeting.

This is not to say that humor never works. But you have to be sensitive to the context. How large is your pinch? (Remember that there may be more to your reaction than you first thought.) What kind of sense of humor does the other person have? Some people enjoy a witty response, even if it’s slightly at their expense, whereas others are likely to take it personally. You also have to consider the strength of your relationship. If the other person knows that you accept them, one kidding comment can go over well. And finally, consider the setting. When all of these factors are taken into account, humor can be used functionally.

 For instance, David’s friend Jane Anne likes to give small dinner parties. Although an excellent cook, she used to spend much of the meal apologizing by saying the food didn’t turn out well; it was overdone or underspiced or a dozen other disparagements. This would continue in spite of strong denials from the guests, since her meals were always great. Those denials didn’t seem to have an impact on Jane Anne, however, and she remained self-critical. Then, at one dinner, after the same routine occurred, her friend Peggy said, “Wonderful meal, Jane Anne, can I have the recipe? But the version without the self-flagellation.” The roar of laughter seemed to sink in, because after that evening, Jane Anne’s excuses noticeably diminished.

In this situation, Jane Anne and Peggy were good friends, and Jane Anne knew that Peggy both liked and respected her. She likely could sense that Peggy wasn’t intending to put her down but instead didn’t want Jane Anne to continue to put herself down. The other guests were also friends, so everyone understood the situation. In this case, the feedback worked and is a good example of how humor can be useful when used appropriately.

Humor is probably not an approach that Elena would want to use with either Steven or Sanjay. She tried to raise her concerns as a pinch as she and Sanjay left the executive committee meeting, but that had little impact, which caused her annoyance to rise further. This is now starting to move beyond a pinch, so she decides that she needs to have a direct talk with Sanjay. The challenge is how to have such a conversation in a way that can both resolve the issue and continue to build their relationship. That requires being able to give behaviorally specific feedback—a crucial competency that we turn to next.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Imagine that you are Elena. How would you respond to her situation in team meetings, during which your ideas tend to be ignored and then restated by others? Would you let it go or say something? And after the executive committee meeting when Sanjay brushed off your concern, what would you do? Think specifically about what you would do and say.



Dealing with Pinches: Think about pinches you have felt in the past.

 How do you tend to respond? Do you tend to just take it, brush it off, withdraw, look for an opportunity to pinch back, or get upset?





Key Relationship: Do you have a current pinch with a key relationship? What has stopped you from raising it?



Using Humor: How do you tend to use humor? What happens when you do? Are there any ways you use humor that are dysfunctional? Do you have a friend who uses humor well? What do they do that makes it work?





APPLICATION


If you identified a lingering pinch with a key relationship in question 3 above, raise it.

 In the coming weeks, be aware of times when you feel pinched. Do you have a sense of which ones are worth letting go and which ones are worth raising? Do you recognize any patterns in your choices? What action are you prepared to take, having recognized these patterns?

Do you know somebody who doesn’t respond well when you express a pinch with them? For example, do they brush it off, accuse you of being thin-skinned, or get combative? If these reactions inhibit you from sharing pinches, how could you raise this to improve the relationship?

If you tend to use humor a lot, go to a few people who know you well and ask whether what you say always lands as you intend. You might ask for specifics regarding when it works and when it doesn’t.

Do you know someone who uses humor in a way that bothers you? It might have a put-down quality, or maybe they use it to convey a message indirectly. It’s not a major issue, but a growing pinch leaves you feeling a tad uncertain and is keeping you from being as close as you want. Strategize about how to raise it to improve your relationship, and then follow through.





MAKING SENSE


In these discussions, you have begun the process of removing blocks to a deeper relationship. How did those go? What did you learn about yourself and about building relationships?
