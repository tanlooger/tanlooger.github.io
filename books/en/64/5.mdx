title: 5 INFLUENCE IN BALANCE
---







Maddie and Adam—a Married Couple, Part 1


Most of us had relationships in high school—be they friendships or romantic relationships—where one person had much more influence than the other. The one with greater sway could decide the terms, timing, and circumstances of what to do at any given moment, while the one with less influence usually contributed an enthusiastic “Sure! Sounds great!” whether they liked the plan or not. For a while, this might have worked well enough. But sooner or later, the relationship faded or, more likely, because we’re talking high school here, went up in flames. That’s because for relationships to endure, influence must be balanced and matched.

The cycle of self-disclosure, support, trust, and then further disclosure is an important underpinning of balance. As each person gets to know the other better, they use that knowledge to further the process. We’d argue that there’s always deeper ground to discover. For instance, the two of us have collectively been married for over ninety years (David for over fifty-five, Carole for over thirty-five), and we are still discovering new things about our respective spouses—and they about us. The objective in building strong and meaningful relationships is not to hurl pell-mell into self-disclosure or deepening for deepening’s sake, but rather to take account of what each person needs so that these needs can be met in relative balance.

Reaching the point where each person is satisfied is not easy. As you’ll see in this chapter, it requires understanding the calculus of give-and-take between the two and equalizing the influence each person has. What’s more, relationships that are balanced at one point in time can be thrown off at others, as when one person’s achievement comes at a significant expense to the other. That is certainly the case with Maddie and Adam.





Maddie and Adam, Part 1


Maddie and Adam had been married for eleven years and had a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. When they met, Maddie worked as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical firm that developed cancer-fighting drugs. She loved her job, especially the travel (which sometimes took her to Hawaii), and gained satisfaction from the social value of her product.

Working full-time was quite consuming for both of them, but they had much to share in the evenings and on weekends. They enjoyed cooking together and entertaining. Their relationship felt equal to both of them; they made major decisions jointly, such as where to buy their first house and when to have a baby. Other responsibilities were shared; she was in charge of the kitchen remodel when they finally had enough money saved, and he handled all the logistics when they vacationed. They alternated with whom they celebrated winter holidays, spending one year with her family in town and the next visiting his in New York. Even with this division of labor, they each felt they could influence the other.

Maddie continued to work when her daughter was born but quit her job after her son came along. She and Adam had been able to juggle work and family demands with one child, but taking care of two young children and running the household became too much. Thanks to a childcare swap she’d worked out with her neighbor, Maddie was able to volunteer a half day a week at the children’s cancer center at the local hospital, providing her with some adult contact as well as a break from her all-consuming parenting and household activities.

 Adam worked as a software engineer. He loved his job, which allowed him to constantly learn and stretch himself. The pay was good, but the hours could be long and often required working some evenings—and at least part of many weekends.

The relationship had some strains. Maddie was frustrated that even though they had a reasonable income, Adam tended to be tight with money. She thought it came from his upbringing, as his parents had had to watch every penny, but she was annoyed she had to defend each expense. She didn’t consider herself extravagant. Rather, things wore out, and some purchases simply made life easier.

Their workweek was highly structured, and the couple didn’t have much time together to talk without the kids present. Date nights rarely seemed to work out, and most evenings after dinner, both felt tired and tended to limit their conversation to what was going on with the kids and how their days had gone. Their intimacy suffered—in both the emotional and the physical sense—as they collapsed into bed without really having checked in with each other.

Maddie became increasingly dissatisfied. She missed the rewarding nature of her previous job and the intellectual stimulation of being with adults. She talked about her dissatisfaction with her mother, who just said, “This is the role of mothers. Look at the great rewards in raising two wonderful children.” Maddie didn’t find this answer satisfying but didn’t know how to respond. Even if that’s the way society looks at the trade-off, she thought, that just doesn’t work for me.

When she raised her unhappiness with Adam, he was highly resistant. “Look, this is what we agreed to when we decided to have kids,” he said. “And I’m stressed, too. This job has a lot of pressure.” Maddie thought, Yes, but you have all that job satisfaction, but didn’t say anything. Adam continued, “Anyway, this is all going to get better when the kids start school full-time and are involved in clubs and stuff.”

 That was several years away, though, and the most Maddie could hope for, even then, would be a part-time job. It was hard to offset present dissatisfaction with a vague promise that things would get better in the future. I certainly couldn’t do the sort of work I did before, she thought. And by the time they’re in college, my skills will be out of date. She said nothing, not wanting to cause yet another argument. Instead, she left to do the laundry. For his part, Adam thought, She has the most influence on the kids, and they will undoubtedly be closer to her than to me. What is she complaining about?

—

This is a tough situation without any easy answers. Some of the problem is a function of Maddie and Adam’s stage of life—studies show that dissatisfaction with marriage increases once a couple has children and only decreases after those children have left home. But that doesn’t mean Maddie and Adam are stuck. They can begin to rebalance. Before we explore how, we need to understand the issues that underlie their relationship. It turns out, these challenges look familiar to most of us.





Establishing What Feels Fair


All relationships have trade-offs, but for a relationship to be sustainable, each person has to have enough of their needs met, and each must give things up. Over time, the benefits have to exceed the costs. As relationships develop and each person allows themselves to be more fully known, the two of them can learn how to increase the benefits and reduce the costs.

We certainly see this calculus with Maddie and Adam. They value each other’s intellectual company, they’re financially well-off, they love each other, and they have the joy of children. In the early years of their marriage, the benefits far exceeded the costs. However, new costs and limitations arose—especially for Maddie—and those costs are growing.

 At the core of functional relationships is a rough equity between two people, which produces a sense of what feels “fair.” Eventually, you will feel exploited, even if your benefits exceed your costs, if you believe the other is getting an even better deal. You don’t have to constantly run cost/benefit analyses, or be perfectly in balance at every moment. What matters is that, over time, both people see a rough equivalence.

Assessing the benefits and costs in a relationship isn’t a rational tally of pluses and minuses, nor can it be. What each person values is highly subjective. For instance, Adam greatly values the challenge of his job and minimizes the cost of not having relaxed dinners with his wife and children. Another person might highly value dinnertime with family and be willing to pay the professional opportunity cost by leaving work at five-thirty.

Societal values, background, and personal history all influence the way someone assesses the costs and benefits in a relationship. For example, Adam may have been raised in a home that set more traditional gender expectations. He might also be influenced by the same social expectations conveyed by Maddie’s mother when she said that Maddie should be satisfied with her present situation.

We are also influenced by comparison with others. Maddie might feel incredibly fortunate because a close friend, who also has two children, is divorced and struggling economically. However, she might feel differently if she compared herself to another friend who is happily married with children and holding down a full-time job.

It is crucial that each person be clear about what they want as well as knowing what the other wants. When Adam brushed off Maddie’s dissatisfaction with “This is all going to get better when the kids start school full-time,” he showed little empathy and was somewhat cavalier in ignoring the deep costs she was paying in the moment. So how are you supposed to know what you and the other want?





Rebalancing: Clarify Wants, Then Reassess


Again, emotions are great signposts. When we give credence to our feelings as an important indicator of what we really want, we have a good place to start. Maddie was feeling increasingly constrained by her role as a mother and the decreased intellectual and personal interactions with Adam. Her frustrations were not lessened when Adam correctly pointed out that this was the arrangement to which they had both agreed.

Unfortunately, we tend to judge the “appropriateness” of the needs and complaints raised by others from the perspective of our own needs and values. This is precisely what both Maddie’s mother and Adam did with Maddie’s concerns. This approach is distancing and decreases understanding. Maddie’s needs had legitimacy as her needs, and she wanted to be heard and understood.

That doesn’t mean that Adam’s needs were irrelevant. In fact, his resistance to exploring Maddie’s dissatisfaction might have come from a fear that if they made any changes to the status quo, his needs wouldn’t be as well met. Voicing what he wants is as important. But each person in a relationship has a responsibility to ensure that not only their own costs and benefits are in balance but the other person’s are as well. Unfortunately, Adam appeared not to be concerned with Maddie’s relatively poorer set of trade-offs.

What might Adam have done to get them back in balance? He could have named his fear of losing an arrangement that was working well for him and then temporarily set that interest aside in order to help Maddie explore her frustration. His curiosity would have allowed him to understand his partner better and increase the chance that she would feel fully understood. Showing that you understand what the other is feeling is a form of giving someone what they need. (These are two of the components of “meeting someone emotionally,” which is fully explained in chapter 9.) But we don’t think Adam bears full responsibility for the couple’s tension. Maddie is complicit, a point we’ll come back to later.

 When we can discuss our needs and dissatisfactions, we’re more likely to develop a solution that works for everyone. Not always easy. Carole knows this all too well from her time as an at-home mom with an infant and a two-year-old. By the end of the day, she’d be desperate for adult interaction. Andy, her husband, would come home after a long day’s work and sit on the couch to read the newspaper to unwind. She would fly around the corner from the kitchen and go into a long, uninterrupted diatribe about the new nursery school’s not having any space or their son’s having yet another ear infection. Andy, who is an introvert and needed some space and time to himself, would respond with little more than a polite “mmm-hmmm.” This would infuriate Carole, since she is an off-the-charts extrovert. She wanted his full, undivided attention.

These interactions did not go well for either of them until Carole told Andy that she was not feeling heard, which left her feeling hurt. Andy then shared that he felt frustrated and pressured. Since those reactions were the last thing either of them wanted, the two of them were able to talk about the situation. They both realized that Carole had to give Andy some time to unwind. He wanted half an hour. “Half an hour!” she exclaimed. “I’ve been counting down the minutes until you got home. How about five minutes?” They settled on fifteen, which allowed them to change their dysfunctional pattern. Even though the solution didn’t provide Carole with Andy’s undivided attention the minute he got home, or provide Andy with as much time to decompress as he would have liked, they both got enough of what they wanted and, in the end, felt they were getting more than they were giving up.

The second step in rebalancing, once you’ve clarified wants, is to reassess whatever arrangements you’ve made in the past. Agreements that feel right at one point in time don’t necessarily work as well later on. The decision that Adam and Maddie made when their second child was born worked when they made it and even for a couple of years afterward. But what was initially satisfying for Maddie grew less so, and what was missing grew in importance.

 Conditions change in all relationships—new work opportunities arise, family members become sick, and people age. When individuals become locked into past agreements, they run the risk that their own growth, and the growth of their relationship, will stall. The best relationships continue to evolve as each person discovers new needs, seeks different benefits, and learns to deal with and let go of prior limitations. Problems arise, though, when people grow at different rates and in different directions, producing strain on the relationship. The danger is that one or both stop growing to avoid conflict. As we will see with Adam and Maddie, when this imbalance happens, the only productive way forward is to directly face these changes, understand their impact, and jointly explore how to address them.

Reassessing relationship agreements isn’t simple. It’s apt to result in change, and change often triggers resistance: How is this going to turn out? Will I have to give up something that is really important to me or incur a cost I’m not prepared to pay? It also brings unpredictability (How are you going to respond?) and perhaps guilt or recrimination (Why did we not do this before?). Be prepared for this not to be solved in one discussion and for it to feel bad and frustrating before it gets resolved. Reassessing relationships is crucial—just don’t assume it will be a cinch.





Digging Deeper


What kept Adam and Maddie stuck in their past agreement? Was it just Adam’s refusal to recognize it was no longer working? Was it Maddie’s reluctance to push harder out of fear she would create conflict? While all of these played a part, a larger and more fundamental issue was their difficulty influencing each other in the face of contentious issues.

 Note that Maddie’s unhappiness with her home arrangement wasn’t the only issue the two of them avoided. There was also what she saw as Adam’s excessive frugality. Part of their difficulty was a result of status differences. When someone (generally a woman) quits their job to become a stay-at-home parent, the balance of power in the relationship shifts. The at-home parent often loses status with regard to decisions around money and how it’s spent, which creates further tension.

Influence discrepancies exist in most relationships, though minor ones are rarely a barrier to talking honestly and coming to an effective solution. However, a significant difference in influence often results in a dysfunctional cycle.





Alas, this dynamic sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why should the high-influence person listen to the low-influence person if the former sees the latter as having little to offer? Since people resist being put in a dependent position (which the low-power person is in), they tend to withdraw. When they do, they contribute less, thereby reinforcing the perception that they have little to add.

Adam and Maddie colluded (unconsciously) in establishing a significant discrepancy between them. Adam didn’t take Maddie’s concerns seriously and offered a flip solution that left her feeling misunderstood, unappreciated, and powerless. Furthermore, he tried to hold her to their previous agreement, and in responding abruptly and without acknowledgment of what she’d said, he conveyed he was not very open to influence.

 But Maddie added further to the discrepancy by not fully stating her unhappiness and backing down when she left to do the laundry. She also lost influence by letting Adam’s logical arguments rule the day, superseding the value of her feelings, and by buying into his position that they’d made an agreement and that was that.

The couple needed a meta-level discussion. By that we mean, “Can we talk about why we can’t talk?” They needed to temporarily set aside the content of their disagreement to discuss what was blocking their ability to communicate. To use an analogy, when you drive your car from home to work, your goal is to arrive at the office on time. But you also pay attention to how the car is operating. Do the brakes seem weak, the steering loose? Is the engine periodically sputtering? Ignoring those as you wobble down the road is not going to end well, as you might not make it to work at all. But such a meta-level discussion was unlikely if Adam felt satisfied and Maddie felt disempowered.

This ability to process how we communicate and problem-solve is one of the most crucial competencies in building deep relationships. It can help resolve specific issues at hand and make future problem-solving that much easier. We have already seen examples of this kind of processing in the two previous chapters. In chapter 3, Elena felt blocked about sharing personal issues with Sanjay and only overcame those after she shared the concerns that were holding her back. Likewise, in chapter 4, Liam abruptly changed topics when discussing work issues, and he and Ben only made headway when they explored what was behind this reaction.

While David and Carole were writing this book, they had multiple opportunities to practice what they preach. David would constantly come up with new content ideas that he wanted to discuss. Carole’s first thought was usually, Oh no, here he goes again—we’re trying to take stuff out of the manuscript, and he keeps adding to it! At these times she had three choices. The first was to say, “No, we’re not doing that.” The second was to say, “Okay, I’m too tired and have lost my patience, so you just do it.” The third, which is what she most often chose, was to manage her irritation and consider his new ideas. Choosing to consider his ideas does not mean that Carole was not simultaneously open and direct with David about her feelings of irritation and the ways in which she had weighed her options in how to respond.

 In other words, her choice was to double down on her commitment to David, the book, and their relationship. Regardless of how increasingly frustrated she felt about his seemingly never-ending suggestions (which she had to maddeningly admit were often good), what drove her decision was the belief that reaffirming her commitment to the book and the relationship was what mattered most. And as she did that, David also increased his commitment to her, the book, and the relationship.

If you don’t double down on commitment when conflicts arise, you are less likely to have a good outcome, which then makes it harder to commit further. Suddenly, you are in a negatively reinforcing loop. On the other hand, the very act of demonstrating commitment can begin an important positively reinforcing loop. The more we commit and invest, the more rewarding the outcome is likely to be, and the better the outcome, the easier it is to commit more.





Breaking the Negative Cycle


Differences in influence occur at work, in sibling relationships, in friendships, and, of course, in marriages. Just because two people are trapped in a dysfunctional cycle doesn’t mean that they’re forever doomed to stay there. Either Maddie or Adam could break the cycle, although it’s easier for the one with more influence to initiate the change. And, as challenging as it might be for the lower-influence person to take the initiative, it is possible. The first step is for Maddie to stop giving away the power that she has. People give influence away all the time, often without realizing they are doing so.





TEN WAYS YOU GIVE AWAY INFLUENCE


Assuming that your needs are secondary to the other’s



Not listening to your feelings



Letting yourself be interrupted



Backing down when someone disagrees with you



Avoiding conflict—not disagreeing with the other, keeping things nice



Not giving feedback, assuming the problem is probably yours



Being concerned about being liked/approved of and seeing that as most important



Minimizing the importance of your comments



Not taking credit for your accomplishments



Not pointing out a problem unless you have a solution





Any of these beliefs or actions can make it hard for the lower-power person to raise the difficult issues and stick with it. However, the single most limiting one is the fear of conflict—believing that conflict is a sign of a flawed relationship and/or that once unleashed, disagreements will escalate and permanently damage or even destroy the relationship.

Some of these beliefs come from our upbringings and experience and are especially fraught for people who have been marginalized as a result of societal power differentials. (For example, girls are often raised to be “nice” and learn to defer, while black men often are taught never to show anger or pride.) While we are all impacted by the circumstances under which we were raised and the demographic groups we belong to, we have choices regarding the extent to which we allow ourselves to be controlled by them.

 Even though arguments are rarely pleasant and can escalate to dangerous levels, sweeping problems under the rug can be just as perilous. Not only do the issues rarely go away, but they can fester and grow. For example, if Maddie stays silent, her resentment is likely to escalate into further negative thoughts: Adam cares for himself more than he cares for me. All that’s important to him is his career. He doesn’t care about my growth and development. He just wants to use me as a housekeeper and babysitter. He is acting just like a typical self-centered man. This would be an example of ways in which negative feelings grow when left unexpressed. She also knows how explosive expressing these thoughts could be—they could damage their marriage—and she worries that communicating her dissatisfaction could trigger these thoughts, which could slip out in a moment of anger.

Maddie’s fears aren’t entirely misplaced: These discussions can be damaging if handled poorly. Yet the solution isn’t to avoid them. You need an important set of competencies to productively raise and resolve disagreements. Those are the subjects of the next chapters, so let’s get into them!





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in either Adam’s or Maddie’s position. If you are Adam: You and Maddie made an agreement early in your marriage that you believed you could count on, that is working well for you, and that Maddie now wants to change. If you are Maddie: You made an agreement years ago under different circumstances, and that agreement no longer works for you.

 How would you be feeling?



How do you think you would respond? What would you be likely to do?





Discrepancies in Influence: Consider the dysfunctional trap that Adam and Maddie have fallen into as a result of the influence differential between them—Maddie has much less, while Adam has much more. How would you respond to this/what would you do if you were Maddie? If you were Adam?



Mutual Satisfaction: Select one of the important relationships that you identified in chapter 2 and write down:

 What are the sources of satisfaction (benefits) you gain from this relationship?



What are the limitations (costs)?



What do you think the other person sees as the benefits they receive from the relationship?



What do you think might be some limitations (costs) that they experience?



How equitable/balanced does this relationship feel? To what extent are you both getting your needs met in rough balance with the other?





Based on this assessment for you and this key relationship, is there a significant discrepancy between the two of you? If so, what do you think is the source of this discrepancy?



Mutual Influence: This chapter also stressed the importance of each person’s ability to influence the other. For the same relationship you explored above:

 How much do you believe you can influence this person?

If you chose 1 or 2 for this last question, what is it about how you act and/or how they act that results in your having more influence? If you chose 4 or 5, what is it about how you act and/or how they act that results in their having more influence?

What is the impact of the power difference, if there is one, on your relationship?



Giving Away Influence: On this page is a list of ten ways we give away influence. Do any of these apply to you? If so, explore why that is the case. What do you worry might happen to you if you do not engage in these behaviors?





APPLICATION


If you identified a discrepancy in mutual satisfaction or influence between you and the key relationship you chose, have a discussion with them. Do they see it the same way? Discuss what it would take to reduce the gap.

Note that in this discussion, you will be using what you learned in the previous four chapters. You need to disclose what you need, what your feelings are, and what you hope the conversation will do for your relationship.

Share the way(s) you tend to give away influence. Ask one of the key people in your life whether they see it the same way. If they do, how can they help?





MAKING SENSE


What was the impact of these discussions? What did you learn about yourself, and how did it affect your relationship? Did the discussion make it easier or more challenging to have similar discussions in the future?

Your discussion was not only about influence, but it was also about the two of you influencing each other. To what extent was each of you open to being influenced by the other? Given what you have learned, what will you do differently?
