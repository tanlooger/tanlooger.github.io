title: 7 WHY FEEDBACK IS THE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
---







Elena and Sanjay, Part 4


Elena decided that she had to meet with Sanjay and give him feedback. The question was how to do it so that he would take her concerns more seriously than he had when they left the committee meeting. She didn’t want him to feel attacked or put down. She also didn’t want him to think that she was asking something special for herself or taking advantage of their friendship.

Elena can be direct without being abrasive by using behaviorally specific feedback. This is a crucial competence that allows you to raise difficulties in a way that minimizes defensiveness. It not only resolves interpersonal issues but also is key for personal learning and for building meaningful relationships.

This is especially important when you have feedback you don’t think you can raise. The two of us disagree, and passionately believe that you can say (almost) anything to (almost) anybody if you stick with your reality. We put the “almost”s in parentheses because, having lived in academia, we are used to being cautious about sweeping statements. But after two glasses of wine, we drop the “almost.” We agree with our Stanford colleague and JetBlue board chair Joel Peterson, who says, “Feedback is the breakfast of champions.”

Sticking with your reality is more complicated than you might imagine, as there are actually three different areas of understanding, or realities, that exist when two people interact. Take the conversation between Sanjay and Elena as they walked out of the executive committee meeting, when Elena expressed feeling bothered that Sanjay didn’t acknowledge her contribution to the group’s report. The first reality is Sanjay’s intent, which was that he wanted everybody to “take a team perspective.” That first area is what only Sanjay knows. This includes his needs, motives, emotions, and intentions. The second reality is his behavior, and that is the area they both see. It consists of Sanjay’s words, tone, gestures, facial expressions, and the like. The third reality is the impact of his behavior on Elena, and that’s the area in which Elena is an expert; it comprises her reactions (emotions and responses). Note that initially, each person can only know two of the three realities. Sanjay doesn’t know the impact of his behavior on Elena, and Elena doesn’t know his motives or intentions.

If Elena sticks with her reality, she can raise issues in a direct, non-accusatory way that actually helps both of them understand what’s going on. She can point to the behavior and share her reactions to it. She doesn’t have to know Sanjay’s intentions. It’s when she moves beyond her reality and makes statements about Sanjay’s motives that her feedback becomes accusatory. In describing this model, we tell our students to imagine a tennis net between the first and second “realities”—that is, between intent and behavior. In tennis, you can’t play in the other’s court, and the same is true with feedback. You have to stay on your side of the net.





Why Most Feedback Doesn’t Work


Generally, people don’t use the feedback model. They don’t stick with their reality but go over the net in making attributions about the other. People say, “You just don’t want to cooperate,” “You want to dominate this discussion!” “I feel that you only think about yourself,” or “I feel like you don’t care.” (And you know our stance by now on feeling words. But in case you’ve forgotten, there are no feeling words in any of these statements!) No wonder so much feedback causes hurt and defensiveness, given the likelihood that the other person will feel misunderstood or, worse, attacked.

In an ironic twist, young kids are often better at staying on their side of the net than adults. When Carole’s children were five and seven, she overheard the younger one say to the older one, “Nick, that’s the third time you’ve picked the game and I don’t like that. I pick the next game or I’m not playing.” The younger one didn’t know enough to impute a motive (“You want to control”) or label him (“You’re being a bully”). Instead, she was very specific about what Nick was doing that she didn’t like and told him so. How simple. After that they took turns choosing what they played next, and…never, ever fought again. (Ha!)

Adults often fall into the trap of thinking that they know other people’s motives and intentions. But unless they’ve explicitly told us, what we surmise is only our hunch. Their intentions are their reality, not ours. Furthermore, it’s rare that the intentions themselves are the problem. Remember the adage “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Rather, the problem is with their behavior, and there can be many reasons why a person, even with the best of intentions, acts in ways that another person might find problematic.

Feedback also goes awry when the person giving it thinks they’re describing someone’s behavior (the second reality), but they’re really not. Behavior is something you can point to—words, gestures, and even silence are all forms of behavior. A useful test is to ask, If people were shown a video of the interaction, would they agree they saw the same behaviors? Conversely, saying, “You are dominating the discussion,” is not an observable behavior; it is a judgment made based on a series of behaviors. What exactly did the other do that has led you to draw that conclusion? Did they interrupt and talk over others’ comments? Or dismiss the value of another’s contributions? Or keep on pushing their point until others gave way? The last three are behaviors.

 This can seem like nitpicking, but insofar as the other has a tendency to deny your feedback, the more specificity you provide, the more difficult it is for them to do so. It is harder for them to dismiss the feedback when you point out the four times in which they didn’t let others finish their point. It is those behaviors that led you to see them as dominating the discussion, but that is your conclusion.

Another common problem with feedback is that you’re not always aware of all the ways you have been impacted by someone else’s behavior. That’s important because recognizing your reactions and, especially, your feelings is your area of “expertise” and forms the basis of your influence. How did Elena feel when Sanjay didn’t acknowledge her contributions? Was she slightly annoyed or very upset? How did that, in turn, affect her attitude toward Sanjay? Did she feel less trusting? And last, did it impact her willingness to raise new ideas and lessen her commitment to the work? Sanjay is likely to pay the most attention to these reactions because they speak to his effectiveness, and sharing them will strengthen her feedback.





The Power of Behaviorally Specific Feedback


Behaviorally specific feedback is powerful for several reasons. If Elena sticks with her reality—Sanjay’s observable behavior and her reactions to it—the feedback is indisputable. When she says, “I felt unappreciated when you didn’t mention my role in that decision,” Sanjay can’t say, “No you didn’t,” because he would then be on her side of the net. But if she were to leave her reality and guess at his intentions by saying something like “The reason you didn’t acknowledge me is that you don’t think it’s important to give credit even when credit is due,” he could say, “No, that’s not true,” and they would reach an impasse.

 There’s another advantage if Elena gives feedback based on her reality: Sanjay is more likely to explain why he acted as he did. When Elena expressed her annoyance as they walked out of the executive committee meeting, Sanjay explained, “I want us to act as a team.” Now she knows his intention. That’s one reason the giver of feedback doesn’t need to figure out the other’s intentions: Sooner or later, the other person will tell you.

In raising her issue before she has written Sanjay off entirely, Elena has given him a gift. Remember, Sanjay knows only two of the three realities; he doesn’t know the impact his behavior has had on Elena—only she does. To be an effective leader, he needs to know how his words and actions are coming across. As the saying goes, if you shoot in the dark, you are unlikely to hit the target. Elena’s expression of her pinch was a cue to Sanjay that his actions might have had dysfunctional consequences. His immediate response was to brush her comment off, but if she had shared her reality, he would have been less likely to do so. As it is, this left her with a question about how much more to say.

The reason why we stress behaviorally specific feedback is that too much feedback isn’t specific and therefore ends up being useless or even destructive. If Joe’s manager tells him, “Joe, you have a poor attitude that interferes with your performance,” it’s bound to make Joe feel defensive and confused. It doesn’t give him exact information on what he has done or how to improve. Which attitudes are the problem—all of them? What work is substandard—everything Joe does? No wonder people are hesitant to give feedback and think they have to “soften you up” with platitudes.

Focusing on behavior avoids these problems. Saying, “Joe, in the meeting today, I noticed that you were mainly talking about your area and not responding to others’ concerns. If you want other people to take your issues seriously, you need to do that for them as well.” That specific feedback is less likely to activate Joe’s concerns about whether all of who he is and what he does is being questioned.

 Many people are hesitant to give negative feedback for fear that it will be damaging and demotivating. The problem is with the term “negative feedback.” The two of us intensely dislike the term because we believe all behavioral feedback is positive. Even feedback on problematic behavior is positive, because behavior is something we can change, and feedback on it is an opportunity to improve. We prefer the word “affirmative” to describe feedback on behaviors you appreciate and want to convey as strengths, and “developmental” for feedback on behaviors that you find problematic.

All feedback is data. The information may say something about the giver, and it may say something about the receiver (often both). But it is all data, and more data is better than less. Quite simply, you’re better off knowing than not. Years ago, a student approached Carole after class and told her he’d felt disrespected when she looked at her watch while he was answering her question (there was no clock in the room, and she had material left to cover). Regardless of her reason, the student’s feedback contained important information without which Carole would have been helpless to address the student’s concern or be sensitive that others might feel the same way in the future. Feedback given with the intention of being helpful is always positive.

These guidelines are just as important when the feedback to be given is affirmative. If you say to me, “Nice job,” it may make me feel warm and fuzzy in the moment, but it’s somewhat meaningless. What exactly did I do that you appreciated? What was the impact on you? What might I learn from this so that I can leverage my strengths in the future?

We will return time and again in subsequent chapters to the behavioral feedback model because of its power in raising and resolving issues in a way that allows all parties to be more fully themselves. This, in turn, not only keeps the relationship on track but also, as we will show in later chapters, improves and deepens it.





Elena and Sanjay, Part 4


Elena contacted Sanjay to “discuss an issue related to the Latin America team.” He willingly agreed and told her to drop by his office that afternoon.

After greetings, Elena began, “Sanjay, I need to talk, because I’m getting increasingly frustrated by what’s happening in the group. Some of it is with my peers, but some of it is with you, and I’d really like to work it out.”

Sanjay looked surprised.

“Don’t worry,” Elena said, “it’s not a capital crime, but I feel annoyed, and it’s beginning to interfere with my enjoyment on the job.”

“What’s the matter?” Sanjay asked with concern.

“As I think you’ve seen, I’m really committed to this group and have worked hard to make suggestions that add to the discussion. But there have been many times when I make a point, nobody says anything, and then five minutes later, one of the men says the same thing and it gets a response. At those times I don’t feel heard.”

“Yes, I noticed that a couple of times,” Sanjay responded. “And I’m sorry.”

“You noticed it and didn’t say anything? That’s even more disappointing.”

“Well, I’m not the schoolyard monitor,” he said a little defensively.

“Sanjay, you’re the leader, and so you’re the role model. And when you don’t say anything, you normalize it. But that’s only part of the problem.”

“There’s more?”

“Yes. I can deal with my peers. But it’s even harder and more disappointing that you tend to say little when I make a comment yet pick it up when a man makes the same comment a few minutes later.”

 “No, I don’t do that.”

“Well, in our last meeting, there were two occasions,” Elena said, and identified specific incidents and the details.

Sanjay reflected for a minute. “Okay, I see that. And sorry—I’ll watch for it. But you know that I really value what you contribute. Our report to the executive committee was much stronger because of the ideas you brought.”

“Yes, Sanjay, I know you value my input and I don’t think for a minute that you intend to ignore my comments. You might have been unaware of your actions—that’s why I want to raise it.” She paused for a minute and then continued, “As long as we’re clearing the air, there’s something else that I found demotivating.”

“What’s that?”

“It was the executive committee meeting yesterday. That idea that they most liked was one that I had to fight so hard for, and I got no acknowledgment from you.”

“But as I said, it’s important to be a team player. We’re all in this together.”

“I accept that. In my view, being a team player doesn’t mean we lose our identity or that the different contributions that people make aren’t acknowledged. I’m committed for a lot of reasons, and it would help if my contributions were recognized.”

Sanjay thought for a moment and said, “I don’t want to play favorites. I want everybody to feel valued.”

“Sanjay, I want that, too, but I think we can be valued in different ways. It’s not a zero-sum game. My being acknowledged doesn’t mean that others can’t be as well. I think all of us like to feel valued. Look, you do a great job managing meetings, keeping us on track, and focusing on our goals. But, as a leader, I think you also need to focus on the contributions each of us makes. I, for one, could use appreciation for the extra effort I’m putting in. I can’t speak for others on the team, but I’d be surprised if I were the only one who felt this way. That’s one reason I’m telling you this.”

 Sanjay was silent for a while and then quietly said, “I guess I know that, but…I think the reason I didn’t mention your role at the executive committee meeting was a fear that, because of our friendship, people might think I was playing favorites.”

“I get that.” Elena nodded. “I’m not asking for favoritism. What I am asking is that you give each of us credit for what we bring. Giving me credit for what I’ve done doesn’t preclude you from giving credit to Heather or Steven or anyone else on the team. I want to also be clear that my intent in giving you all of this feedback is to point out ways in which your behavior is affecting me negatively and to do that early enough for it not to turn into a big deal. It is precisely because I care as much as I do about our relationship that I feel compelled to have this conversation.”

Sanjay nodded in agreement.

Note that from the beginning of the meeting in Sanjay’s office, Elena stayed with her reality and didn’t make any accusations or negative attributions of Sanjay’s motives or intentions. (She did cross the net in making positive attributions when she said, “I know you value my input.” People rarely become defensive when we attribute positive intent, and her objective in saying this was to separate intentions from behavioral outcomes.)

Elena talked about her feelings and what was happening to her. She also put the issue in perspective by saying, “It’s not a capital crime,” and acknowledging low-level emotions: annoyed, not angry. Then she talked about the impact Sanjay’s behavior had on her involvement with the project, which was not only about her but spoke to what might also concern Sanjay. She clearly stated that her intent was to raise the issue because she cared about their relationship, which is also an important element of effective feedback. Furthermore, rather than taking an adversarial stance, she conveyed a common interest. She told Sanjay about specific behaviors that bothered her and was able to point to two recent examples. What is important about this last point is that those behaviors had recently occurred. Feedback that is close in time to an event is especially impactful because it is fresh in both people’s minds. Commenting on somebody’s behavior that occurred months before is much less useful since it has become but a dim and possibly distorted memory.

 Because Elena spoke to what Sanjay cared about, she could be direct. Many people, especially in dealing with authority, believe that they have to beat around the bush. Elena didn’t have to do that since she conveyed information that Sanjay needed to improve his leadership effectiveness.

Being clear about behavior is the starting point. But two people can draw different conclusions from the same action. Elena believes that Sanjay’s not holding members accountable (an observable behavior) has the negative effect of decreasing his authority, but he might conclude that it gives space for others to take on that responsibility and not be dependent on him. What then? Neither of them knows how Sanjay’s holding back is affecting the other team members, but now that they have identified the behavior in question, they can jointly work to find out its full impact.

Elena didn’t make any inferences about Sanjay’s intentions. In fact, it was Sanjay who shared why he acted as he did. Because she agreed with his goals, Elena could be an ally, not an adversary, and show him how his actions were interfering with achieving his objectives. She set up a win-win exchange. As we have mentioned in many cases, it isn’t a person’s objectives that are problematic but how they go about achieving them. That’s why feedback is a gift.

Elena’s statements (talking about herself, her feelings, and what she needed) were indisputable because they reflected her reality. Furthermore, by sticking with her reality without attacking Sanjay, Elena built conditions that made it easier for him to talk about his reality—his needs and his concerns. Note that her self-disclosure led to his self-disclosure, whereas if she’d asked accusatory questions, Sanjay would likely have closed down.





Beware the “Feedback Sandwich”


Too often, people use the “feedback sandwich,” thinking it will make difficult feedback easier to hear. By “feedback sandwich,” we mean starting with something positive (to soften up the other person), then saying something negative, and ending with something positive so they will feel good. “Joe, you really do a good job here. But there’s an issue that we need to talk about. But you really are a valuable employee.”

Unfortunately, this approach rarely works. As soon as you start with the positive, the other’s defenses go up as they wait for the “but.” They brush aside the good news and don’t take it in.

The feedback sandwich is often utilized because you’re concerned the recipient will feel totally rejected if you don’t throw in some positive reinforcement. But that misidentifies the problem. The difficulty is not that the feedback is harsh or negative but that it’s not behaviorally specific enough to be useful. It also contaminates affirmative feedback because it is seen as the ploy that it is—something intended not to provide a learning opportunity, but to manipulate.

But didn’t Elena use the feedback sandwich when she told Sanjay the various things that he does well in leading the team? We’d argue she didn’t, really. When she first walked into his office, she led with what was problematic for her and waited until she was well into the feedback process before noting what she appreciated. What she was trying to do was expand what Sanjay considered his areas of responsibility to include appropriately acknowledging each member’s unique contribution.





Opening Pandora’s Box


Sanjay and Elena’s conversation can feel very tidy, but the world isn’t always that simple. Let’s now assume Sanjay responded to Elena’s initial feedback by saying, “Well, I’m glad you’re raising this, Elena, because I’ve been bothered as well. I want this group to get along, and you tend to be pretty judgmental.”

Elena’s first thought could be, Why did I even raise this? Better to have let sleeping dogs lie. But would that really be better? Many people fear giving feedback out of concern that the other person will turn the tables. However, if you’re doing something that annoys someone, aren’t you better off knowing? If you know, at least you have choices. Not knowing will leave you in the dark. We would argue that Sanjay is better off knowing about Elena’s pinch and that Elena is better off knowing if she’s pinching him, too. Depending on how she responds, this could be an opportunity rather than a problem.

Another reaction Elena might have is defensiveness, since she doesn’t see herself as judgmental. Note that Sanjay is over the net here: He is labeling her instead of describing her behavior. This is an important choice point for Elena. She can either get into an argument (“No, I am not!”) or she can manage her defensiveness and use the feedback model to gain a fuller understanding of his complaint. Doing that might sound something like this:

“Wow, Sanjay, I’m trying not to be defensive because I don’t see myself as a judgmental person. But clearly, I’m doing something that’s giving you that impression. What am I doing?”

“Well, you really came down hard on the guys about their not taking the larger viewpoint.”

“Okay, I can see where you can get that impression, but that raises a couple of issues. You’ve said that you want members to hold each other accountable. Do you really want that? And if you do, is there a way that I could have done it that might have appeared less judgmental?”

This might lead to a rich discussion between the two of them. Sanjay could acknowledge that he wants members to call each other out when they’re going off course but has difficulty thinking of how else Elena could have done it. If Sanjay could suggest a more effective way for Elena to have raised that point, it would be a win-win outcome. She would increase her effectiveness and Sanjay would be less bothered. Multiple gifts all around.

 Elena now has another choice. She has made her point and could end the conversation. However, she sees this as an opportunity to deepen their interaction and reiterate her intent, so she asks, “I don’t know if this is right or not, but I was struck by the fact that you seemed hesitant to confront members when they only advocated for their area. I wonder how you feel about conflict, and again I want to say that even though this feels a bit risky to ask, my intention here is to be helpful to you.”

“Yeah, that’s an issue for me,” Sanjay admits. “I’m more comfortable when things are calm and people get on well with one another.”

“That confuses me, Sanjay. In our meetings, we’ve had some very intense debates, and you seem comfortable with that. Or am I reading that wrong?”

“No, you’re right. But what we’re talking about now is different. I don’t want people attacking one another.”

“I don’t either,” Elena says. “When I called those guys out on not taking the larger perspective, I didn’t call them idiots or say they were incompetent. I was talking about their actions. If we can disagree on tasks, can’t we disagree on people’s behaviors, too? And, Sanjay, in this discussion, do you feel attacked by me? I’m asking because I’m frankly a little nervous about how you might be taking this. Should I have said nothing or been less direct?”

“No, no,” Sanjay assures her. “While this hasn’t been entirely comfortable, I don’t feel attacked and I do appreciate your directness. In fact, the irony is not lost on me that this is probably a good example of team members holding each other accountable.”

“Well, being direct is an important part of how I want to be seen. So, if you can accept that, then I want you to be direct with me and call me out whenever you think I’m being judgmental or punitive. And I’m really glad we had this conversation. It not only cleared the air for me but also leaves me feeling better about the solid ground of our friendship.”

 “Yeah, me too.”

In this scenario, Elena displayed some key competencies that enabled her to handle what could have been a challenging situation:

She was able to control her initial defensiveness. It wasn’t that Elena didn’t feel defensive. Rather, she wasn’t controlled by this reaction; she was able to acknowledge it and move on.



Elena used the feedback model. She (a) described her own reality (“I don’t see myself that way”) without explaining or justifying herself; (b) acknowledged that Sanjay’s reaction was his; and (c) asked for the behavior that gave him that impression.





Elena may have seemed to cross the net when she said, “I wonder how you feel about conflict.” Isn’t she talking about Sanjay’s reality? Not really, because she raises this as a hunch, not a statement of fact, and encourages joint exploration. Furthermore, what’s important beyond her words is her attitude. If she truly believes that she doesn’t know, her tone and body language will convey that. These very words, with a different tone, could have been a leading question implying she knew the answer. That would have been crossing the net. This point is nuanced but important. It’s less about getting the words just right and more about holding to the fundamental belief that you don’t know what’s going on with the other person. This is a great example of using a hunch productively. Elena wasn’t sure but was making a guess. Staying curious about what was going on with Sanjay kept her from crossing the net.

Sanjay showed various competencies, too. As he shared more of his reality (fear that disagreements or holding people accountable would turn into personal attacks), Elena gained more insight about what was important to him. Sanjay listened as well. He heard Elena’s feedback and agreed with the value of their directness with each other. This undoubtedly made Elena feel more heard and her feedback more valued. Finally, in this process, they got to know each other better, and it deepened the type of discussions they can have in the future. Not a bad outcome, Pandora!





“Hey, You’re Over the Net”


When someone else’s feedback is an attribution of your inner reality, as it was when Sanjay accused Elena of being judgmental, it’s tough not to feel defensive. The first reaction is to rebut: “No, I’m not.” A second tendency is to counterattack: “The reason that I do that is because you do X.”

This is a normal response when we feel attacked, misunderstood, or placed in a one-down position. But defensiveness can lead to escalation and prevent both parties from learning. Accept you are feeling defensive, but don’t act on it. Instead, use the feedback model to push the other person back to their side of the court. That’s what Elena did when she said:

“Wow, Sanjay, I’m trying not to be defensive because I don’t see myself as a judgmental person [reality #1]. But clearly, I’m doing something [reality #2] that’s giving you that impression [reality #3]. What am I doing?”



She’s turned an accusation into a mutual learning experience. Although conceptually simple, it’s not always easy to do. One of the most interesting and remarkable things that happens at the Stanford business school is the way in which the model of the net becomes more and more commonplace in everyday conversations as more of the students take Interpersonal Dynamics. We are also heartened about the extent to which it stays with alums for decades. “Over the net” has become a culturally defining term.

 A great example of the utility of these concepts involved a young woman we knew who had learned about the net model from an older friend. Her high school tennis coach was very irritated with her and said, “Your problem is you’re not committed.” She calmly responded to him, “Can you tell me more about what you mean? I’ve never missed a practice or a game, and I happily play anywhere in the lineup you place me. That’s what commitment means to me. But obviously I’m doing something that makes you think I’m not committed. What is it?”

The coach then raised his voice slightly and said, “You show up to practice without your uniform!” To which she responded, “Oh….Okay, I’m glad I asked! I would have never known that was how you defined commitment. If you’d told me I was disorganized and forgetful, I’d have been the first person to agree. I get it now. I’ll be back tomorrow for practice…with my uniform.” Their relationship changed significantly once she learned the source of his irritation and was able to respond to it. Remember, sometimes feedback comes in very ugly wrapping—but that doesn’t mean there’s not a gift inside.

Since by yourself you can only know two of the three realities, receiving feedback is essential to being more effective. You need to know the third—the impact of your behavior. As we often say, “It takes two to know one.” Sanjay now knows himself better as a leader as a result of Elena’s feedback. But what doesn’t work for Elena may work for other team members because our behavior impacts people differently.

For instance, David has a tendency to interrupt before the other person has finished talking. He does this with Carole; Carole interrupts him, too; and neither of us are triggered. In fact, we both find it energizing. But David was talking one day with Donald, another colleague, and noticed Donald frowning. “What’s the matter?” David asked.

 “You interrupted me,” he replied.

David was puzzled. “So what’s the problem?”

“That’s inconsiderate,” Donald said.

Is David’s interrupting good or bad? That’s actually a useless question. Interrupting is useful with Carole because she sees it as a sign of engagement, and it’s dysfunctional with Donald because he experiences it as disrespectful. Donald’s feedback made David more sensitive about differentiating how he dealt with other people, and it allowed him to work on the issue. In ensuing conversations, he told Donald that it had not been his intention to be disrespectful and he’d heard the impact it had on Donald. David said that he would really try not to interrupt but asked Donald for a little forgiveness when he forgot. On that basis, they were able to build a positive work relationship.

One final key point to consider is that feedback says as much about the giver as the receiver. When someone’s feedback is about the other’s motives or intentions—“The problem is that you want to win every argument”—the implication is that the problem is all about the other person. However, when the giver of feedback stays with their reality and on their side of the net—“I feel discouraged when I experience you frequently having the last word in our conversations”—it raises the possibility that the issue involves both parties.

In Interpersonal Dynamics, we repeatedly stress that feedback starts a conversation. It doesn’t end it. Once you’ve shared your feelings, the work begins. You have to unravel all the issues and also ask how much of what’s going on is about you. Think about it: Sanjay was upset when Elena confronted her team members—but that was partially due to his own difficulty with conflict. When you own your part in a disagreement, it often makes it easier for the other person to own theirs. Together, you can search for a solution that more closely fits each person’s needs.

Building relationships where each person feels free to give and ask for feedback is key both to preventing pinches from becoming crunches and to helping each person develop in new and more effective ways. Truly, when people care for each other and their intent is to convey that, feedback is a gift. In sharing this concept with students, we often use a variation on the old Hallmark greeting card and say, “I care enough to say the very worst.” Even if the person to whom you are giving feedback is momentarily taken aback, when done with genuine care and in service of the relationship, feedback is always a gift for which to be grateful.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself in Elena’s shoes. Reflect on the sequence of events. You have a good relationship with Sanjay, but he is still your boss. How easy would it have been for you to do what she did? Would you have pushed as hard? What would have been easy and what more challenging? How would you have gone about raising those issues?



Below are reasons you might have difficulty giving feedback. (Note that some of them overlap with ways we give away influence.) Which ones might be true of you?

 Not staying on your side of the net; making attributions of the other’s motives and intentions.



Not identifying what you are feeling (especially vulnerable emotions like hurt, rejection, and sadness).



Not conveying your intent in giving it.



Giving feedback in too-general terms. For example, being indirect, being nonspecific about the actual behavior, or sugarcoating the impact so the receiver misses your point.



Withholding/downplaying feedback out of a need to be well thought of or respected. Needing to be liked, seen as a “nice person.” Wanting to please others.



Worrying about being wrong or that the other will deny it. Thinking, It’s my problem, so I’m being selfish to impose it on someone else.



Worrying that the relationship might be harmed or permanently disrupted; believing that harmony in a relationship depends upon the absence of conflict.



Fearing of conflict. Not feeling sure you have the skills to manage it.



Feeling discomfort with challenging or confronting—especially figures of authority.



Being concerned about whether the other will retaliate or give you feedback.





How hard is it for you to receive feedback, even if it’s behaviorally specific? Do you…

 become defensive, deny that it’s true, offer excuses, justify your behavior?



jump to what the other does that causes the problem or retaliate by pointing out their faults?



become so upset that you can’t take in the feedback, resulting in the other person’s backing down or feeling guilty for raising the issue?



withdraw and distance yourself from the other person?



pay lip service to accepting the feedback but not take it in?





APPLICATION


Do you have difficulty in either giving or receiving feedback with one of the key people you previously identified? If not, pick someone else to engage with whom you find feedback conversations challenging. In preparation for that discussion, start with a diagnosis. Consider:

What exactly do you think is the problem?

 How will you raise it so that they hear that it is in both of your best interests to discuss it?

What are the behaviors the other engages in, and how do they impact you?

Since you don’t know the other’s reality (i.e., what is going on for them, how they see the situation, and/or why they are behaving the way they are), what do you intend to do to find that out?

Now that you have done this diagnosis on your own, meet with the other to improve both of your abilities to give and receive feedback.
