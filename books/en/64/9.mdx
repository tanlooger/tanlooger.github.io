Phil and Rachel—a Father and Daughter, Parts 1, 2, and 3


Over the past several chapters, we’ve seen our characters face some problematic behaviors and learn to do things differently. Elena learned that being vulnerable requires strength. Sanjay learned there was a cost to avoiding conflict. Liam learned that abruptly changing topics was distancing. These are all important lessons, but what about behaviors that are more fundamental and that have been reinforced for years? Will feedback, no matter how direct and well delivered, really change these long-standing patterns?

We believe that people can change. It can be difficult and requires persistence, but we couldn’t have stayed in the business we’re in for this many decades if we hadn’t seen it happen repeatedly. People might find it challenging and may not want to change at a particular moment in time, but that’s different from not being capable of it.

The famous organizational theorist and MIT professor Richard Beckhard explained with an interesting formula the conditions under which people are more likely to change: R < D × V × F. The R is for “resistance to change.” In order for change to happen, the product of the other three variables has to be larger than the resistance. The D stands for “dissatisfaction,” meaning you need to be aware of the cost of your present behavior. The V stands for “vision,” meaning you need to see the benefit of new behavior and believe that the result will be worth the effort, and the F stands for “first steps,” meaning you believe you can acquire new skills that make change easier.

The story of Phil and Rachel explores just how tricky this formula—and changing long-standing patterns—can be.





Phil and Rachel, Part 1


Phil and his daughter Rachel were both physicians working at the same hospital, although Rachel was also building a small private practice on her own. They’d always been close, bonding over basketball (both played varsity in college) and the practice of medicine.

Rachel recognized that their relationship hadn’t changed much since she was a teenager. Her dad had always been very invested in her success—he was her biggest advocate and cheerleader as well as her chief professional counselor. When Rachel’s young daughter Emma expressed an interest in basketball, Phil renewed his passion for informally coaching the sport. Unfortunately, most of what Phil tended to give was advice—to both Emma and Rachel. This had been useful when Rachel was playing college ball and when she navigated medical school, but she found it less and less helpful as time went on.

They didn’t have all that much to talk about beyond sports and medicine, and Rachel wished she had more of a sense of her father’s internal world. When her mother was alive, Rachel would find out how he was feeling from her but almost never directly from him. When Rachel told her dad what was going on in her life, he tended to respond with parental advice rather than his own disclosure.

Since her mom had died the previous year, Rachel made it a point to have Phil over for dinner with her husband and kids at least every other week, or to go on a weekend outing together. She also tried to grab breakfast or lunch with him at the hospital when their schedules coincided.

 On one such day in the hospital cafeteria, Phil and Rachel bantered as usual about the dismal lunch offerings, talked hospital politics, and mentioned some interesting cases they each had. Then Phil launched into his usual pattern of questions.

“What did you decide about expanding your practice and taking on that friend of yours as a partner?”

Rachel felt the familiar clench in her stomach. Here we go again, she thought. She’d been trying to decide for months whether it was time to expand her one-person private practice and invite her longtime friend and colleague Nadya to join her.

“I’m still thinking about it,” she said. “Like I’ve said, there are lots of pros and a few cons that I’m evaluating.”

“Well,” said Phil, “I think you’re crazy if you don’t seize the opportunity to snag Nadya right now. She’s a really great doctor and you’ve been friends since medical school, so you clearly get along. People like her don’t grow on trees, you know.”

“The question has nothing to do with whether she’s a good doctor or we get along, Dad. It’s more complicated than that.”

“What’s so complicated?”

Rachel thought about once again explaining that the decision was fraught with financial and logistical complications but decided not to go there. Phil continued sipping his Coke and eating his lunch in silence, waiting for her response.

After a minute, Rachel finally said, “Dad, we’ve talked about all of this before, multiple times, and I really don’t want to go over it all again.”

“No-brainer. You should just do it and stop overthinking it.”

Rachel felt her anger rise. She was irritated by her father’s advice and felt her concerns were being dismissed. She was also frustrated with herself: She had once again let the conversation move to something happening in her professional life about which Phil had opinions—and strong ones at that. Given how many times they’d had a similar interaction, Rachel felt more than a pinch; she was downright pissed.

 She was also annoyed that Phil hadn’t gotten the message that his advice was unwelcome. Even though she’d raised it very gently several times before, he was back at it again. I don’t want to beat him over the head, because he takes things so personally, she thought, but this has got to stop. I’m forty-three years old, for goodness’ sake. This conversation is no different from when I was eighteen. There has to be some way to change that. I’m not sure how much longer I can bite my tongue when he oversimplifies an issue I’m struggling with, flippantly telling me what I ought to do.

It was near the end of the lunch hour and they both had patients to see, so she decided to let it go. “Dad, this is not useful, so let’s drop it.”

Phil looked hurt and said, “Geez, I was only trying to help.”

“Well, it wasn’t helpful,” Rachel snapped. Then, catching herself, she said, “Emma is practicing with her team and the new coach this Saturday afternoon. Why don’t you come over for lunch, and then we can go over and watch them practice?”

Phil looked relieved and nodded. “That would be good. See you Saturday at noon.”

They both picked up their dishes and headed back to their respective clinics.

Even though Rachel had a full schedule with patients that afternoon, she found her mind wandering back to the lunch conversation. It is so annoying that he doesn’t get it, she thought. But maybe it’s too much to expect. He’s been this way all his life. Maybe there is something to the saying that you can’t teach old dogs new tricks.

She also thought of a recent conversation that she’d had with her friend Tomiko, who’d said, “I have the same issues with my dad. Look, Phil’s sixty-eight years old. What do you expect? And he’s always been a little tin eared. Once I started just accepting my dad the way he was, things got much better between us. Personally, I think you’re better off dropping it and living with the advice-giving behavior.” Rachel wondered if Tomiko might be right and she should give up trying to get Phil to take this issue seriously. But this didn’t feel fully settled for her.

 At lunch on Saturday, Emma was full of energy and chattered about her middle school team and the new coach.

“How is he?” asked Phil.

“He is a she, Grandpa,” Emma said. “I think she’s good. But a lot of the other girls don’t take it very seriously, and Coach has a hard time managing them, so we haven’t played much yet.”

Phil frowned. “The season will be over before you know it. You really need to work hard, Emma.”

Rachel felt her stomach tighten again. “She does work hard, Dad! Now, Emma, go suit up, we need to leave in a few minutes.”

As Emma left the room, Phil turned to Rachel and said, “You should just march yourself in there and let that coach know that unless she rights that ship pretty quickly, she’s sunk.”

“Dad, for God’s sake. She’s just getting started.”

“I’m telling you,” said Phil, “the sooner you address this, the better. I can tell you from all those years watching you play. Emma’s love of the sport is on the line here.”

“Stop it! You’re just making me feel like an inadequate mother. And earlier this week you made me feel like an inadequate professional, incapable of making a good decision about taking on a partner. I’m getting more and more irritated.”

Phil was taken aback. He looked down at the floor and initially said nothing. He then responded defensively. “Look, all I’m trying to do here is help. I only have your best interests at heart. And I certainly don’t want to frustrate or irritate you. If you want, I’ll just stay out of your business entirely.”

“Dad, that’s not the solution. No, I don’t want you to stay out of my business. But there’s a way that we talk about my business that just doesn’t work for me anymore. We’ve got to leave for practice, but we need to find some time to talk more about this. What’s going on isn’t helping either of us.”

 As they all got in the car, Emma chatted with excitement, but both Rachel and Phil were silent. What can I do so that he will respond differently? Rachel wondered. Can he really change?



* * *



—

Rachel’s predicament is not unusual. You’ve probably told someone that a behavior of theirs bothers you, only for them to repeat their actions time and time again without seeming to learn. Observers might shrug and say, “That’s the way he is; that’s his personality.” But we would argue that’s just not the case. There’s a big difference between personality and behavior. Personality is extremely difficult to change—if you’re an extrovert, you’re unlikely to become introverted no matter how hard you try. That doesn’t mean you can’t work on leaving more space for others to speak, which is a behavior. No one’s born with genes for being inconsiderate or self-centered. Is it really in Phil’s DNA that he so often defaults to giving advice? Um, we don’t think so.

This isn’t to suggest that it’s easy to modify long-held habits. But it’s worth exploring why a behavior is so central to someone that they don’t seem able to change it. In Phil’s case, he’s given advice for decades, and it’s been very useful to Rachel in the past, reinforcing its value. Additionally, he’s a doctor, an occupation where giving advice is not only routine but historically expected. The medical setting also stresses rationality, which requires keeping emotions in check. So it’s not all that surprising that he doesn’t disclose a lot of his feelings to his daughter.

When someone engages in habitual behaviors, as Phil did, others learn to adapt, thereby reinforcing them. It is doubtful that patients, nurses, or interns complained about Phil’s advice-giving habits or asked that he interact in a more self-disclosing manner. Also, probably out of a sense of kindness, his wife perpetuated his reticence to disclose feelings to his children by being the interpreter between them. And while giving advice has been one of Phil’s strengths as a physician, when overdone, as with Rachel, it becomes a weakness. Given this is a learned behavior, can’t it be modified?

 Carole’s own family had a similar pattern. Her father was a man of few words, a prototypical strong, silent type of his generation. In many ways Carole was the son her dad never had, and they had much in common—both were competitive, pragmatic, and driven. Carole always felt very close to her dad and fondly remembers numerous conversations where he was quite vulnerable, particularly when he talked about his war experience. Even though she always sensed that there was so much more to know, she never pushed. So it came with some sadness when Carole’s stepmother (the woman her dad married late in life, after he was widowed) recently told her that one of his biggest regrets was that he was not more involved in raising Carole and her sister. Carole had never imagined he’d have this thought, because she’d never probed. Now she wonders what might have happened had she pushed herself outside her comfort zone and asked for more closeness. How much more would she have known about him? How much more known would she have felt by him? And how much deeper might the relationship have been?

When you conclude too quickly that a certain set of behaviors is “the way that person is and will always be,” you might be doing them an injustice. Instead, try to understand all the factors that perpetuate that pattern of behavior. Asking Phil to be emotionally self-disclosing is no small request—his patterns have been heavily reinforced and changing them will be clumsy—but that doesn’t mean Rachel shouldn’t ask or should assume change is impossible. Phil’s behavior might simply be deeply reinforced.

Think of a sport where you’ve developed “wrong habits.” For example, let’s say you started off in tennis with a weak backhand and compensated by switching hands so that you could always play your forehand. When the coach demands that you play backhand, your initial shots are inferior. Why switch when I was doing okay? Phil may have a similar feeling.

 Even understanding that her dad has some deeply ingrained patterns, it would still be easy for Rachel to put all the blame on Phil. Why doesn’t he get it? Is he that tone-deaf? she thinks. But wasn’t she partially responsible for their impasse? Yes, she expressed her feelings (in words, tone, and nonverbal signals) and pointed out the problematic behaviors, but she did it by snapping at Phil rather than showing empathy and by providing detailed feedback that fully described the situation. Her shorthand might have been attributable to lack of time (both at the hospital lunch and before the basketball practice), but it might also be a reflection of her internal conflict.

On the one hand, she was growing increasingly frustrated with Phil’s repeated advice-giving, but on the other hand, the last thing she wanted to do was hurt his feelings. She was sensitive to how difficult his life must be now that his wife was gone, and she didn’t want to make it even more difficult. I love him so much, she often thought, and he drives me so crazy. Because she felt internally blocked, her feelings came out muddled and unclear.

Another problem is that Phil heard her request about advice-giving as if he had to stop it completely. Often when you want somebody to modify a behavior, you don’t have something that extreme in mind. As one of our colleagues often points out, it might be easier to think of this as a dial to be turned down a bit as opposed to a switch to be turned off. Might there be times when providing advice would be useful? Also, might it be useful to recognize that what Phil really needs and wants is to be helpful and show him other ways he could get that need met? The point is, Rachel could make change easier for Phil.





Phil and Rachel, Part 2


After the basketball practice, Rachel reflected about her recent unsatisfying lunch conversations with Phil and realized that avoiding a full discussion could jeopardize the future of their relationship. She saw that she hadn’t been as open as she could have been and decided to double down on letting Phil know specifically how his behavior impacted her and their relationship.

 She suggested they take a hike the next weekend to talk things through, and while he wasn’t sure what the problem was, Phil agreed. That Saturday, they met at the start of the trail. As they set off, she said, “Thanks for agreeing to walk and talk, Dad. I know you aren’t big on this kind of stuff, so I appreciate it.” Phil just shrugged, so Rachel added, “This is really hard for me.”

“What’s so hard? Just spit it out.”

“I’m afraid what I want to say to you is going to hurt your feelings, and I don’t want to do that,” she said. “I’m also afraid that if I don’t say this to you, it’s going to hurt our relationship.”

“When did you become so melodramatic? What are you getting at?”

Rachel decided to let the first comment slide. “What I’m getting at is that when you give me advice, I find myself more and more irritated. It doesn’t seem to matter how many times I tell you that it irritates me; you keep doing it. I’m kind of at a loss as to what to do about it and worry that if we don’t address it, the problem is just going to get bigger.”

“What problem?” said Phil, stopping on the trail.

Rachel looked incredulous. “Really? Did you just say that? The problem is that it drives me nuts when every interaction we have eventually ends up with your giving me advice. And when I tell you that the advice isn’t helpful, you ignore me and plow ahead. And then the bigger problem is that you don’t seem to be hearing that it’s a problem no matter how often I raise it!”

Phil looked really hurt. “You’re telling me I have to stop giving advice? You’re asking me to be someone I’m not, and unless I become that person, then our relationship is going to hell in a handbasket. I guess I’m a bad father.”

Rachel felt tears in her eyes as they continued walking. Phil didn’t say anything else. Maybe Tomiko was right, she thought. Then she stopped walking, as did he. She decided to try again.

 “No, Dad, you are not a bad father. But when you respond the way you just did, it drives me crazy. Going into this self-flagellating mode keeps us from dealing with the problem. It’s become a much bigger deal than the advice-giving behavior itself.”

They walked in uncomfortable silence for a while, until Rachel finally broke it. “Look, Dad, we have to talk about how we can work this out. Just to be clear, I am not asking you to change your personality. It is your actions, your behaviors, that are the issue. And those you can control.”





When Giving Feedback Hits a Wall


Rachel had two objectives. The first was not to back down. And the second was to do a better job giving Phil feedback on his advice-giving and responses to her attempts to talk about it. This is not as easy as it sounds. Even though she was more direct on their hike than she’d been before, it didn’t really seem to be working, and Phil’s reaction only increased her frustration. She could have easily given up or blown up.

With Ben and Liam, and again with Elena and Sanjay, feedback worked because both giver and receiver shared the same sense of joint responsibility to move into a problem-solving conversation. Although Rachel provided feedback that also stayed on her side of the net, Phil wasn’t willing to play ball. Instead, he acted in ways that made it hard for Rachel to continue.

He showed hurt feelings, inducing guilt. He withdrew and said little, and he shifted the focus of the conversation back to advice-giving and away from their inability to talk things through. The barriers Phil put up are not uncommon. There are others, too, that Phil didn’t use but that we see all the time. (Some of these were mentioned in the prior chapter in which we discussed dealing with defensiveness.)

Denial

“No, I don’t do that. I think you’re imagining that.”



Defensiveness

“I don’t do that very much. This was just an exception, and anyway, others do it as well.”



Explanations/excuses

“The reason that I did it was because…” “This is what you do that makes me do that: …”



Retaliating

“Well, you do things that are a problem. This is what you do.”



Blaming

“You raised the issue in the wrong way.” “It’s because you didn’t handle it properly.”



Putting the other down

“I’m disappointed in you.” “I had hoped that you would have done better.”



Questioning motives

“Aren’t you raising this issue so that you can dominate?”





When someone puts up these barriers, they’re not really hearing the message. The feedback giver will often back away (as Rachel considered doing) or refrain from offering feedback in the future.

There are some circumstances in which responding with resistance makes sense. What becomes a problem is when the receiver consistently relies on these responses in a way that prevents them from taking in the feedback.

Rather than giving up or pounding the other harder, it might be necessary to temporarily shift the focus of the feedback. Let’s imagine that you want to give an employee—let’s call him Sam—feedback on a certain behavior: He has a tendency to say he’ll do something and then doesn’t follow through. But just about every time you bring it up, he has an excuse. The pattern blocks Sam’s ability to hear feedback and your desire to give it.

 The feedback can now shift to his pattern of excuses. “Sam, you have a tendency to have an excuse each time I raise the issue of your not coming through, and it really bothers me.” But what if when you do that, he has another excuse? What seems like an infuriating loop is actually an opportunity: You can point it out right as it’s happening. “Sam, this is what I am talking about.”

This is similar to what Rachel faces. There is not just one single time that Phil didn’t get the message about his advice-giving. Time after time, she raises it, only to have him brush it aside. There’s an underlying problem in their ability to problem-solve together, and that’s what she needs to address.





Phil and Rachel, Part 3


“Dad,” Rachel pleaded, “say something.”

“I have nothing to say.”

Rachel cried softly. “Dad, that can’t be true. You must be feeling a lot, and I want to hear it—as I want to feel free to share how I am feeling.”

There was a long pause while Phil seemed to take it in but remained silent.

Rachel continued, “I’m going to give this one more try. And I am desperate to have you hear me. I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t love you as much as I do and I didn’t care as much as I do about our relationship. Can we sit down over there on that flat rock and try again?”

Phil stopped walking and looked at her. He nodded and followed her to a large flat boulder overlooking the valley. The afternoon sun streamed through the trees.

 “Please, Dad. This is so important to me, and, I really believe, to both of us.”

“Okay. Tell me again what’s so irritating about my advice.”

“Dad, your advice-giving is not the big issue.”

“I’m so confused. I’m offering to talk about my tendency to give you advice, and now you don’t want to talk about that. What is it that you want from me, for God’s sake?”

Rachel hesitated, unsure about whether to press on. Ordinarily she would have responded with a “Never mind” and they would have resumed their walk. But she realized this was part of the problem. If I don’t say this now, I’m never going to say it, she thought.

“The bigger and deeper issue is that I often don’t feel heard or acknowledged when I give you feedback or talk to you about something that’s a problem for me.”

Phil was quiet as he looked out at the valley floor beneath them.

“Dad, this is really hard for me, and your nonresponse is just making it harder.”

“I’m doing my best. When you have a problem, I offer solutions. I hear you don’t like that, even though I don’t know when that became the wrong thing to do.”

“Dad, it’s happening again, right now, between us.”

Phil, somewhat irritated, said, “What the heck are you talking about?”

“I appreciate your wanting to talk about your advice-giving tendencies, I really do. And that is certainly something I want to talk about more as well. But I just told you there is something bigger to this for me, which you did not acknowledge. The very exchange we are having right now is the pattern I want to talk about. I again don’t feel heard, and what’s more, I feel dismissed.” She put her arm around him and continued, “Please, Dad. I love you and this is so important to me.”

Phil softened, though it was clear he was uncomfortable. “Okay, I’m starting to get that you want me to listen to you more. Even though I think I am listening.”

 “Yes, Dad, but the issue is not whether you are listening to me, it’s whether I’m feeling heard. Those are actually different.”

“Hmmm, I never even thought about that. So should I just tell you that I hear you? I can do that.”

“That would help, but I mean something more. By ‘being heard,’ I mean are you really trying to understand me? Several times in the last week, I said that I was irritated. Not only did you not acknowledge that you heard that, but I didn’t hear that you were concerned about it or wanted to find out what was going on with me. We can’t work out our issues if we don’t try to understand each other.”

“But that’s why I offer solutions. It’s my way of showing you I understand and care.”

“Dad, I don’t need your solutions. If you work to understand me and I try to understand you, the solutions will come out.”

“That’s hard for me,” said Phil. “I’m used to giving answers, not asking questions. Questions are what Mom was so good at.” There was a long moment of silence, and then he continued, “But I think maybe I’m starting to see what you’re getting at.”

Rachel smiled. “And this moment is the first time I have felt heard by you in a long time.”

As they resumed their walk, they went back to the advice-giving conversation, and Rachel sensed Phil’s effort to hold back on giving answers. Instead, he seemed to really try to understand why she was so bothered by their previous interactions.

Going back to the Beckhard formula of R (resistance) < D × V × F, Rachel increased her father’s understanding of the cost he was paying by causing her unhappiness (the D for his dissatisfaction), helped him understand what could be better (showed him a vision—the V—for how it could be), and showed him more about how to get there (the F for “first steps”).





Meeting Someone Emotionally


Rachel wanted Phil to see how problematic his advice-giving was to her, as well as to respond differently when she talked about what was important to her—she didn’t want him to shut down. She also wanted something we call “feeling emotionally met.” Being able to connect in this way with another is especially important when you’re at an impasse, where conflict and emotions are high and each person is having difficulty understanding the other.

There are two ways to think about meeting others emotionally. One is what they need to feel, and the other is what you need to do.

When people feel emotionally met, they feel fully heard, understood, seen, accepted, and not judged. That requires hearing beyond the words and listening for underlying meaning. This is not how Rachel felt from most of Phil’s responses until the very end. It was not necessary that Phil agree with Rachel or think her requests were “right” or “correct” for her to feel met. What he had to do (and finally did) was to convey that he understood what she was feeling and why she was feeling it from her perspective.

There are a variety of behaviors that help someone else feel emotionally met (this is the doing part). They include:

Active listening that assures the speaker that you understand them. Some of this is conveyed nonverbally, with eye contact and head nodding. Listening slows the conversation down in an important way. Giving someone plenty of space to stay in their feelings as opposed to talking them out of them or countering with your own is the key.



Paraphrasing/acknowledging feelings. Repeating what you’ve heard someone else say is a powerful way to convey you have heard them, and to find out in the moment whether you heard them correctly.



Active empathy—for example, saying things like “That sounds really crummy,” or simply being with the other person and listening actively while they stay in their feelings. That may require that you temporarily set aside your feelings, if yours are different.



Conveying care. Again, this can be done with words, but it can also be nonverbal, as when Rachel put her arm around her father.



Suspending judgment and engaging in curiosity and inquiry. This means asking open-ended questions and really trying to understand what is going on for the other person.





Obviously, one rarely uses all of these behaviors at one time. However, meeting someone emotionally is likely to require a number of them. When fully present with the other, you can usually sense what’s appropriate. Sometimes just saying, with feeling, “That’s really horrible,” is sufficient. Rachel felt emotionally met when her father stopped to take in what she was saying and simply responded, “But I think maybe I’m starting to see what you’re getting at.”

When we are highly emotional, being able to set our own feelings temporarily aside so that we can fully hear the other person might be too big a request. I might have to first acknowledge that it is too hard for me to be fully present to your feelings in this moment. And if I do, it is important to then come back and re-engage when I am feeling less emotionally triggered. We are not suggesting that meeting someone emotionally is a way to avoid disagreement or conflict. It is simply a way of responding to someone else when they are in a heightened emotional state. And it is a way to connect at a very personal level.





One Conversation at a Time


It took a great deal of persistence, but Rachel made significant progress. It would have been easy for her to give up on her father and conclude that he just couldn’t hear her in the way she wanted. Maybe his admission “That’s hard for me” helped her realize that what she was asking was a major change in behavior for him. However, it is rare that one conversation, even as successful as this one appears, can fully change such deeply rooted habitual behavior. But at least it’s a start; Phil now understands what is happening for Rachel and has learned some new ways of interacting. It is almost certain that he will regress and fall back on familiar patterns. What is crucial is that Rachel not give up. It’s a process of “two steps forward and one back,” and it’s important that she continue to acknowledge his progress, as she did when she told him she finally felt heard. Too often, we focus on what a person does wrong, forgetting how impactful positive reinforcement can be.

 Remember that sometimes a straight line is the longest distance between two points. A discussion starts on one topic, and it becomes apparent that there are other, more important issues to deal with. When this happens, take a pause. Step back. Is there a barrier that needs to be confronted? As Rachel did on the hike with her father, put the first topic aside and look at how you are talking. Notice how you are feeling. Speak to that! Resolving that deeper issue will help not only with the issue at hand but also with future problem-solving, resulting in a far deeper and more robust relationship.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself first in Rachel’s shoes. Even though you are frustrated with your father, you don’t want to hurt him. How do you think you would handle this situation? Would you give up? Which of the various approaches that she used would you have tried? Not tried?

Now put yourself in Phil’s shoes. You really value the relationship that you have with your daughter and don’t want to lose the closeness you have. But you are comfortable with the way you presently interact and would find it difficult to do what Rachel wants. How would you handle that situation? What would you have done and said?



Outdated Agreements: Are you in a relationship (key or other) that you care about, but in which some of the ways you relate seem stuck in the past?



Your Contribution: Could you, like Rachel, be doing something that is making change unlikely in this relationship? For instance:

 Assuming “That’s the way they are; that’s their personality”



Lacking clarity in your feedback (about specific behavior and impact on you or on what you need)



Assuming change is easier than it is



Lacking persistence and patience



Neglecting to use D × V × F (dissatisfaction × vision × first steps)



Wanting the change for your sake and not taking into account what the other wants





APPLICATION


Based on the reflection above, have a conversation with the other person to see if you can redefine the relationship so that both of you benefit.





MAKING SENSE


How did it go? What did you learn (about yourself and about influencing another)?

In retrospect, is there anything you would have done or said differently?
