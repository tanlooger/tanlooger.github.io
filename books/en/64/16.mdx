title: 16 WHEN EXCEPTIONAL ISN’T IN THE CARDS
---






The two of us have been living and breathing exceptional relationships for decades, and yet we don’t always get there with people in our lives. From childhood through adolescence, Carole had a very close relationship with her late mother. Flora made it clear that she wanted them to be “best friends” so that Carole could tell her everything, which is pretty much what she did. Flora gave Carole a lot of what Carole took to be good advice on everything from makeup, to boys, to the dangers of premarital sex. Carole wasn’t a rebellious kid. She followed the rules, got good grades, and stayed out of trouble.

Everything changed when Carole became an adult, got married, and had her own children. She discovered that their “close” relationship was predicated on Carole’s always agreeing with Flora and almost always subsuming Carole’s needs to hers—otherwise Carole was “selfish.” Flora was very good at giving feedback when she was disappointed or angry but terrible at receiving feedback when anything she did made Carole feel bad. She was one of the most judgmental people Carole has ever met—highly opinionated and exceedingly difficult to influence.

As Carole began to learn more about effective interpersonal dynamics, she wondered whether there was a way she might have a truly close relationship with her mom, as two adult women. When Carole was in the middle of her PhD program, the two had a memorable exchange.

“I don’t understand why you’re bothering with this whole PhD thing,” Flora said. “Your kids and husband are not getting the attention they need.”

“Mom, when you tell me you don’t understand why I’m bothering to get a PhD at the expense of having more time for my family, I feel bad about myself,” Carole said. “Is that your intent?”

“Of course not, I just think you’re driving yourself crazy unnecessarily.”

“Unnecessarily according to who?”

“Everyone.”

“I’ve had many conversations with Andy about this, and he is one hundred percent behind it. And I have asked him if he thinks he and the kids are having to sacrifice too much, and he has assured me that’s not the case.”

“I don’t believe it.”

“So you think he’s lying to me?”

Flora was silent for a moment and then said, “I’m just going by my own experience. There was a time when you and I got together all the time—went shopping or just had lunch. We schmoozed on the phone for hours. You don’t ever seem to have time for that.”

“That’s true, and you’re right. And it’s precisely because I want to focus the spare time I do have on Andy and the kids.”

“Which is why I don’t understand this whole PhD thing.”

“Are you saying you aren’t supportive of my getting a PhD because I don’t have as much time to spend with you as you want?” Carole asked.

“I said no such thing. I said it’s hurting your family unnecessarily.”

And so it went. Try as she might to convey the impact of conversations like this, Carole was repeatedly unsuccessful. Carole tried to explain that her inability to influence Flora was distancing them. She tried to tell Flora how much it bothered her every time she made a definitive judgment about someone else in the family. And Carole told her that it made her want to spend less, not more, time with her when Flora seemed closed to the possibility of being wrong. Carole told her that she was saying all this in hopes they could have a closer adult relationship.

Flora most often responded with tears, saying Carole was being unfair. All she wanted was to be closer, and Carole was the reason they weren’t as close as they’d once been, because she was “too busy.” Carole tried to point out that their closeness had been a function of how they interacted when Carole was younger (which was characterized by Carole’s always deferring because Flora was always “right”), and that no longer worked. Flora dismissed this, argued that wasn’t the case, or deflected the conversation.

It was hard for Carole to accept that despite what she’d learned about creating exceptional relationships, she was not going to have one with her mother. When Flora was dying of cancer, Carole tried one last time. She tried to be the best daughter she could through her mother’s surgeries, visiting often and driving her to and from the infusion center several days a week for months. In spite of multiple invitations to talk about how she felt about what was happening, Flora would not go there. Carole believes Flora just couldn’t engage in a conversation in which there was any chance she might not have the upper hand (and yes, that attribution is over the net). Carole loved her and knows the love was reciprocal. But they did not have an exceptional relationship.

An important outcome from exceptional relationships is the opportunity to grow and develop, but that growth has to be in directions each person wants—not in the direction the other wants for them. But what happens when the other’s needs result in their wanting you to develop differently than you want? Flora claimed that she only had Carole’s best interests at heart, but Flora wanted Carole to grow (or more accurately, not grow) in ways that would force Carole to regress to the ways they had related when Carole was a teenager. Carole, in turn, wanted her mother to grow but defined that as being able to talk about the fact that she was dying (among many other difficult conversations).

Again, this issue might have been resolved if mother and daughter could have talked about it, but Flora wasn’t inclined to have those kinds of discussions. Exceptional requires a willingness to look at issues, allow for the possibility of being wrong, and consider new ways of seeing things. Flora wasn’t game because, above all else, she needed to be right. There can be caring, even love, as was the case with the two of them, but that is not what defines exceptional. As much as each might have wanted a more intimate relationship with the other, Carole’s loss of autonomy was a price too high for her to pay and the absence of a commitment to growth and learning from Flora precluded theirs from becoming an exceptional relationship.

This chapter covers why, in spite of all your efforts, sometimes more meaningful relationships don’t develop. It might be that as you and your counterpart learn more about each other, you discover your views are so different that the effort involved in bridging them is simply too much work. Or perhaps you don’t have enough in common—and the costs of building a serious relationship don’t outweigh the benefits. But what if your relationship had the potential to become exceptional, and it didn’t quite get there? What happened? Was it anything you did or didn’t do? What can be learned from relationships that stall along the way?





Phil and Rachel—Only So Far


In chapter 9, Rachel resolved a major frustration with her father, Phil, when she told him his advice-giving and lack of empathy drove her crazy. One confrontation didn’t completely address these issues, and Phil sometimes reverted to his previous mode, but they now had a relationship in which Rachel could call him on it. As time went on, Phil curbed his tendencies more and more, and their relationship grew steadily closer.

 Emboldened by that success, Rachel realized there was more that she wanted from her father. He didn’t share significant parts of his life with Rachel, and she wanted to be let in. Since her mother had passed away, Rachel had wondered and worried about how Phil was adapting. She also had growing concerns about his performance as a surgeon. The hospital didn’t have a forced retirement age, and Phil was several years past when he could have collected benefits. When she occasionally brought the subject up, his response was always, “Work is keeping me young,” to which he would add that he had no plans to retire. The conversation always ended there. However, Rachel began hearing rumors that her father’s surgical skills were not what they’d once been. She was concerned where that might lead. I’d hate to see him pushed out instead of leaving on his own terms, she thought, but when she tried to raise the issue delicately, Phil laughed it off and said that his peers were just envious that, at his age, he was still as good as they were.

Rachel yearned to discuss this more and to delve into other personal topics. How did he feel about his career as he reflected on the last four decades? Any disappointments? Did he ever think about paths he wished he’d taken? How was he really doing, having lost the love of his life? She tried to build conditions for that sort of conversation by sharing numerous personal and professional issues that she was facing. Phil seemed to value those discussions, and with his decreased tendency to give advice, Rachel found it easier to disclose her feelings and struggles. But try as she might, this did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. Phil was a closed book.

Rachel decided to be more direct. She made arrangements for them to go out for dinner. As they ate, she laid out the sorts of discussions she wanted to have and what both would gain. “You’ve said before that you want to pass on your experience; talking about your life is one way to do it,” she argued.

 “But that isn’t me,” Phil said. “I don’t find reflecting on my life that enjoyable and it seems fruitless to talk about paths I might have taken. I just believe it’s best to turn the page.” He was silent for a minute and then said softly, “And talking about your mom is just too painful. Can’t we just enjoy what we have?”

Rachel persisted. “Look, let’s try it and see what it’s like. I mentioned several areas. Pick one that you’re most comfortable with and we can see how it goes.” Phil thought for a moment and said, “I had a choice of two specialties; let me talk about that.” He did so for the next half hour, but Rachel could see that his heart wasn’t in it, and the discussion felt forced. Phil shook his head. “This isn’t working. Look, I love hearing about your life, and I’ve been good about not giving advice. I would be glad to talk about things we did—trips we took—when you were growing up, but that’s all I want to say about the past.” Rachel nodded her head and reluctantly agreed to that compromise.





Changing the Basis of a Relationship


What Rachel wanted was more fundamental than she realized. It’s one thing to want a change in another’s behavior, even when it’s as ingrained as Phil’s previous tendency to tell others how to lead their lives. But it’s another to change the very basis of their relationship, which is what Rachel was asking Phil to do.

She was now an adult and wanting more of an adult–adult relationship. This would have required significant changes for both of them. Rachel would now have to step up to the plate more—which she was starting to do—and Phil would have to do more than just cut down on his advice-giving. He would have to be more vulnerable and self-disclosing. The success of their discussion about Phil’s advice-giving moved them in the direction of a more equal relationship, but only so far. It didn’t appear that he wanted to go much further—certainly not the distance Rachel wanted. Was this too big a change for him?

 Even though Rachel wanted Phil to be more emotionally self-disclosing, he had spent most of his life with a far more analytical style. Furthermore, his training and his professional environment didn’t necessarily reinforce the vulnerability she wanted, nor did his home life: Phil’s wife had spent years “interpreting” Phil’s feelings to Rachel. Change can be very difficult when a central way of relating has been so consistently reinforced.

What, then, are Rachel’s options? She could choose to let it be. After all, look at what she’s gained. Rachel made a lot of headway in her relationship with Phil over the past year. She was able to share more of herself without Phil’s getting into advice-giving. This allowed a closeness that both of them appreciated. One of the potential downsides of focusing on exceptional relationships is devaluing any connection that doesn’t reach that level. Sometimes it’s necessary to simply be grateful for what’s been achieved. We get different needs met from different people. Rachel is in a rewarding marriage and has close friends. She could go to them to get her needs for deeper connection met, while enjoying what she does have with her father.

On the other hand, she could push a bit more. She’s seen that Phil can change, so maybe there’s more he can do. She’d always had a close relationship with her father, and this next step holds the possibility of an even richer connection for both of them. As for Phil, sharing more about his life (especially with his daughter) could provide a more meaningful way to relate—even if it is difficult for him. And it would also meet his stated goal of passing along his experience.

But how much should Rachel push? Was that thirty-minute attempt at dinner an adequate test? If she picked up on his offer to have nostalgic conversations about her early years, might those morph into the more personal disclosures she’s wanted? Or would she just be flogging a dead horse?

The answer comes in the form of a question (we are teachers, after all—it’s in our wiring!): For whose sake would she be persisting? Sometimes we just need to accept others for who they are. Is she picking up any real clues that Phil is lonely and wants more intimacy, or is she pushing him because of what she wants?

 There’s another way to view Rachel’s choices. As mentioned at the beginning of this book, Carol Dweck suggests that when identifying a present limitation, it is important to add the word “yet.” When a statement like “I can’t fully express all my needs with my significant other” gets a “yet” at the end, the meaning changes from hopelessness to possibility. Rachel doesn’t know what the future holds for Phil. Maybe a surgery won’t go as well as it has in the past, and it will be easier for him to discuss that with Rachel than with another surgeon. Or perhaps Phil will see a colleague who is over the hill but won’t recognize that reality, and Phil will realize he doesn’t want to go that route. At those times, Phil might be more amenable to self-disclosure.

There is a danger that the harder we push, the more we risk alienating the other person. Holding desires too tightly can squeeze the life out of a relationship. Instead, sometimes meeting the other person where they are increases the chance they’ll join the journey at a later time. Rachel can value and appreciate what she’s gained without giving up awareness that conditions might change and that more might become possible. Indeed, she herself might change. Perhaps more personal self-disclosure from Phil will become less important to Rachel as she reflects on all that she has gained over a lifetime with her father.





Ben and Liam—a Failed Attempt


When we left Ben and Liam in chapter 4, the two friends had made some progress. Ben said he would work on not pushing with personal questions as much, and Liam promised to raise issues he had with Ben rather than just shutting down. He also said he’d try to share more.

Over the following year, their friendship grew. Liam met and fell in love with a woman named Brittany, whom Ben thought was great—and perfect for his friend. Ben loved the way that she held her own with Liam, who, at times, could be dominating.

 Because Liam spent quite a bit of time with Brittany, the two men didn’t see each other as often. One night when they met up for drinks, Ben asked Liam how it was going, and Liam divulged that he thought Britt might be the one.

“That’s awesome!” Ben said. “She’s great, and I’m really happy for you.” Liam looked pensive and wouldn’t meet Ben’s eye, so Ben followed up. “Is there something going on?”

Liam laughed and shook his head. “I can’t slip anything past you…which I guess is good. The problem is her mother. Nancy drives me nuts. She thinks she has the answer to everything—she gives her opinion about things she knows nothing about.” Liam got more agitated as he continued. “Just last week she started lecturing me about buying a house, even though she knows nothing about my finances and nothing about the housing market.”

Ben shook his head sympathetically. “Ugh, that’s annoying. What do you think’s behind it?”

“For one thing, she is incredibly needy. Her husband died about four years ago, and she can’t seem to move on with her life. Nancy calls Britt every day. Britt and I occasionally take her out to dinner since Britt feels bad that she’s so lonely, but those dinners put my teeth on edge. She spends most of the time interrogating Britt about her life and then telling her how she should lead it. For Christ’s sake, Britt’s an adult, and a competent one at that. It drives me crazy! Why does Nancy think she’s God’s gift to people’s issues?” Liam took a deep breath. “And I think what bothers me even more is how Britt responds to her—or, more accurately, doesn’t. She just says, ‘Thanks, Mom. That’s something to consider,’ to all that advice and then changes the subject. Why doesn’t she tell Nancy to back off? I’m starting to lose respect for her. I want a wife who has backbone.”

“Boy, you’re really upset about all of this!”

 “Of course I am,” said Liam. “Wouldn’t you be?”

Ben felt conflicted. On the one hand, he wanted to support Liam, but on the other, he sensed that there was more going on. He had never met Nancy, but Liam was painting a very one-sided picture. It was hard to believe that she was as horrible as Liam described. Also, Britt had impressed him as a self-assured and grounded woman. She didn’t appear to be weak or overly compliant. He wasn’t sure what to say that might be useful. So he nodded and said, “Yeah, probably.” He let a moment pass, then asked, “Why do you think they act that way?”

“Look, I’m not their therapist! And I don’t need you to play therapist. I just want to blow off steam. Not sure I have anyone else I’d be comfortable doing that with.”

“Got it,” said Ben. “I hear you—this sounds really tough. Especially given how much you care about Britt.”

Liam leaned back and relaxed a bit.

“And I’m glad you’re venting to me,” Ben said. “I want you to feel like you can do that with me. But I have to be direct here—you’re describing the situation pretty narrowly. It might not be so black-and-white, and it would suck if you broke things off with Britt because you’re thinking that way. We don’t need to talk about it if you don’t want to, but I needed to say this.”

Liam was quiet. Then, somewhat hesitantly, he nodded and said, “Go ahead. What are you thinking?”

“I don’t know Nancy, but I wonder if she’s as much ‘the Wicked Witch of the West’ as you’ve described her. And I do know Britt a bit, and she doesn’t strike me as a person without backbone! She sure stands up to you. So why are you labeling her as so passive? Seems to me she’s found a good way to handle her mom.”

“Yeah, but it’s the way Nancy holds court all the time. Britt should just shut her down.”

“But that’s your way. You say that Nancy thinks she knows the right way to do things; aren’t you doing the same thing? Anyway, why are you so worked up? Britt seems to let it roll off her back—why can’t you?”

 “That pisses me off, Ben. Why do you always turn it back on me? So it’s my fault?”

“No, that’s not what I’m saying. All I’m saying is that the only person you really have control over is yourself. I’d be annoyed by Nancy, too, but I don’t think I’d be as bent out of shape as you are. And I actually respect how Britt’s handling the situation. She’s not letting herself be controlled, but she’s also not attacking her mother. I just wonder if you’ve asked yourself what’s behind all of this for you.”

“What good would that do?”

“You’re talking about marrying Britt, so Nancy will be your mother-in-law. You need at least a decent relationship with her. Can you figure out what’s going on with you so that you don’t find her impossible?”

“I don’t know,” Liam said. “This introspection stuff isn’t my thing, but I’ll think about it.”

In the subsequent months, Liam and Britt’s relationship continued to blossom, and Ben and Liam met up less frequently. But their friendship grew stronger as Liam shared more of his feelings about Britt. Ben was sensitive about not asking how things were going with Nancy, although he worried about it.

Then Liam told Ben that he and Britt were engaged and were planning the wedding for the coming June. The friends found a time to meet up for a celebratory drink. After they caught up on work and general life, Ben asked Liam how the wedding plans were going. Liam rolled his eyes and took a swig of his beer.

“We should have just eloped,” he said. “Predictably, Nancy has taken over and Britt has let her. This feels like Nancy’s event, not ours.”

“Ugh, that sucks. Must be hard on Britt.”

“I actually don’t think it is,” Liam said. “The most maddening thing about this is that Britt seems to be just fine with all the decisions Nancy is making. Drives me nuts.”

 “I thought things had gotten a bit better between you and Nancy.”

“Nah, I just don’t talk about it.”

Ben stopped for a minute to reflect. “Liam, I still don’t get why this bothers you so much—especially since it doesn’t sound like it bothers Britt. Do you think there’s something about you and your dynamic with Nancy that’s the problem?”

Liam exploded. “Ben, I’m sick and tired of this psychoanalysis crap every time I’m upset about something, and I’m not going to have another one of those touchy-feely conversations. It makes me not want to tell you anything.”

Ben backed off. “Sorry. I was trying to help. Let’s talk about something else.”

The conversation moved on to other topics—work, Ben’s training regimen for an upcoming marathon, an apartment that Liam and Britt were considering renting, and the woman Ben had been seeing and planned to bring to Liam and Britt’s wedding.

At subsequent get-togethers, both before and after the wedding, Liam continued to express his frustration with Nancy, and Ben limited himself to sympathetic comments but didn’t try to explore the underlying issues. Liam mentioned that he’d found Ben’s recent comments helpful and said, “Thanks for just letting me vent instead of getting all touchy-feely.”

“Guess we like different things.” Ben shrugged. “As I’ve said before, I sort of like digging deeper into these things.”

Liam shook his head. “Yeah, and that sort of navel-gazing is not for me.”

As time went on, Ben and Liam saw less and less of each other. Liam focused on his marriage, and Ben realized he got less out of their relationship. They remained friends and would periodically get together for drinks, but Ben found other relationships more satisfying, so that’s where he put more of his time and energy.





When People Want Different Things


At first blush, it looks like what kept Ben and Liam’s relationship from being exceptional was that they wanted very different things. Liam appeared to want a connection based on “being a buddy” where he could just share the ups and downs of his life. Ben wanted a connection that was more deeply personal. Earlier on, they had enough shared experiences around work and sports to grow a friendship, but over time these were overshadowed by the disconnect between what they were each looking for in a relationship.

Wanting different things out of a relationship doesn’t necessarily have to be an obstacle, but it does have to be addressed. People can grow in different directions and in the process want something different. That doesn’t necessarily mean they will grow apart. Close relationships aren’t dependent on wanting exactly the same things. The basic problem that Ben and Liam have is their inability to discuss these differences. Without that, they can’t reconcile them.

They have fallen into the “either-or” trap. Either Ben stops asking personal questions or Liam tolerates them. That has blocked them from getting clear about what each wants and doesn’t want. Did Liam not want any introspection? Or was it about Ben’s approach? Would it have been okay with Liam if Ben wanted to explore his own issues and use Liam as a sounding board, as long as Ben didn’t expect Liam to do the same? We don’t know, but neither do they. They never got that far.

For example, Ben could have asked, “What’s getting in our way? Why are we having such difficulty?” Liam might have squashed that line of questioning as “too touchy-feely,” but he might not have. The point is that Ben didn’t ask, and they weren’t able to get into figuring out how to talk about the disconnect more productively.

Not being able to discuss this limited the potential of their relationship. At best, it will stay where it is, with the two periodically getting together to catch up on events, but they might just drift apart. It’s unlikely that they’ll forge a truly meaningful relationship.





Exceptional Relationships at Work


Both of us have spent much of our professional career applying the competencies in this book in work settings. We have coached executives and managers in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, in educational and medical settings, and in governmental organizations at the national and local levels. We have helped employees, managers, senior executives, and CEOs learn how to deal more directly and honestly with each other. We have helped teams develop so that conflict can be dealt with productively, interpersonal problems resolved, and strong relationships built. In this process, we have seen great individual growth, better work conditions, and higher performance.

We have also seen and experienced exceptional relationships in a work setting. They have the same characteristics we have described throughout the book. These relationships can occur whether you are the boss, a direct report, or a peer, though an organizational setting poses its own set of challenges in building them.

There are significant constraints that don’t exist outside of work. You might be able to pick your friends and partner, but less so your colleagues. Simon might be a royal pain in the neck, but your work is interdependent, so you have to find a way to build a productive relationship. Even when you do have strong work friendships, there is only so far you are going to go to help others advance if it is at your expense. Yes, you want to support them, but hierarchies are inherently competitive—there’s only so much room at the top. If one of the dimensions of exceptional relationships is that you’re committed to the other’s development, you may feel conflicted supporting a colleague in getting the special assignment you both want. You’re not going to sabotage them, but how much are you going to sacrifice your own advancement?

Good working relationships can develop into close friendships. That is important because doing so can motivate both parties to be more honest and transparent with each other as well as decrease the risk in raising difficult issues. But there are limits. This was vividly illustrated in a talk that Jeff Immelt, CEO at General Electric, gave at Stanford several years ago: “I was one of the three senior vice presidents reporting to Jack Welch. Jack and I were good friends; our families would often have barbecues together. One time, I had missed making my numbers for two quarters in a row. At an executive retreat, Jack took me aside, put his arm around my shoulder, and said, ‘Jeff, I really like you, but another quarter like the last two and you are out.’ I made sure to make my numbers next quarter.” Organizations can be positive places to work and supportive of employee development, but the needs of the organization are inherently placed ahead of the needs of the individual.

 In your role as a manager, you are faced with another constraint. You want to develop your employees, and you now know how to give developmental feedback. You also know that providing stretch assignments is another important way for them to grow. But as we have said, your primary responsibility is the organization’s success. You might think twice before giving a crucial task to an employee who might fail, even if it would be a learning opportunity for them. Balancing developmental needs with organizational success is an important managerial competence, and it involves risks.

Strong, high-trust relationships are ones where we can be open with each other. But it’s not easy for a direct report to admit self-doubts to his manager if it decreases the chance of getting a choice assignment—even though such an admission could be valuable in getting needed coaching. Furthermore, even if the employee might know what their boss does well and not so well, they are likely to have concerns about offering honest feedback or even strongly disagreeing with the person who signs their paycheck. Sam Goldwyn, the famous Hollywood movie mogul, reportedly said, “Tell me the truth, even if it costs you your job.” Bosses may say they want honest interactions, but how much and how often?

 None of these factors inherently block exceptional relationships at work. It is possible to have those with co-workers who, like you, are looking to advance; with your direct reports as you balance concern for them with obligations to the organization; and with your manager, despite the power discrepancy. We have provided a number of examples on how to do that in this book. Moving a relationship at work toward exceptional requires the competencies you have learned. Disclosure, being direct, dealing with pinches, giving and receiving feedback, raising difficult issues, speaking to the other person’s interests, and addressing power differences all lay the foundation. Most work relationships can probably reach the meadow. Once there, you need mutual commitment, a steady and ongoing process of increasing self-disclosure, continually stretching 15 percent beyond your comfort zone, and seeing setbacks as something to explore and learn from rather than as a reason to retreat.

In spite of organizational constraints, our experience is that most managers and employees want more open and direct conversations than they often have. In the programs we conduct for executives, we have found it fascinating that when we ask, “How open can you be with your boss?” the responses are most often, “Oh, I have to be very careful,” “I need to watch my words if I disagree,” and “It’s best to make bosses think the new ideas are theirs.” These answers are irrespective of the participants’ level of management.

Then we ask a follow-up question: “If your direct reports disagree with one of your ideas, what do you want them to do?” The responses are again similar across all levels of management. Except this time the answer is, “I want them to be direct, to lay it out, not to beat around the bush. I want to know the truth.”

We then observe, “Isn’t that interesting? All the people in this program are secure and centered, but all have bosses who are fragile and insecure. Clearly, we need to get your managers, not you, to these programs!” As we noted above, if you use the lessons from this book, you can be direct and straightforward. You can help your boss see that you are on their side and your intent is to be their ally. You are likely not only to gain more respect but also to end up with stronger and more functional relationships. With that as a basis, it is possible that many work relationships can grow to be exceptional.

 Our intention is not to be flip and imply that any of this is easy. Nothing in this book is easy! But then again, you already knew that. Applying this material in an organization is far more complex than we could do justice to in this chapter. For a deeper dive, we recommend two books David co-authored with his colleague Allan Cohen: Power Up: Transforming Organizations Through Shared Leadership and Influence Without Authority.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Checking Progress: At the beginning of the book, you identified relationships you wanted to develop further. Where are you now with them? Of course, these still have the potential for further growth, but are you satisfied at this point in time? Are some similar to the significant progress that Rachel experienced with her father? Are you satisfied with having reached the meadow? Or do you want to make the final ascent to the summit?



Work Settings: Are there a couple of work relationships that you would like to significantly improve or move further along the continuum? For each of them, be specific about what would make them stronger. What concerns come up for you as you think about raising these wishes with that person?





APPLICATION


For those relationships in which you’re happy with the progress made (be they at the meadow or beyond), to what extent have you fully expressed your appreciation to those people for joining you in the journey? If not, do so!

 For those with whom you have stopped at the meadow, what have you decided to do? If you choose to stay there, have a conversation in which you share how much you value the progress, and make sure that in doing so you do not diminish what you have accomplished. If you still want to encourage them to go further, ask for what you want in a way that is compelling without being coercive.

Choose one of your work relationships from your self-reflection in question 2 on this page. What can you do to explore ways in which the two of you can make your relationship stronger than it is now.





MAKING SENSE


What did you learn from the conversations you had above? What did you do that was successful, and what was less so?
