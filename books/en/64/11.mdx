Mia and Aniyah, Parts 2 and 3


Let’s go back briefly to the metaphor in chapter 2 about hiking Mount Washington. Mia and Aniyah had anticipated an easy climb up to the headwall. Then the weather changed, storm clouds came, and they got soaked. They are now at the foot of the most difficult part of the climb. Should they try the ascent? It will be hard, and the rocks are slippery. Should they turn back? If they keep going, they could get hurt, but if they make it to the meadow, the hardship will make their accomplishment all the more meaningful and the view all the more satisfying.

That said, maybe it’s not worth it. Maybe they should just retreat. They’re at a key decision point, and how they move forward has everything to do with their commitment to each other, their ability to handle this difficult situation, and whether their relationship is worth possibly more conflict.

Although Aniyah might feel stuck, she actually has a range of options. She could give up on the long-term relationship. She could wait to see if Mia makes the first move; however, that would entail giving up control of what happens next. She could take the initiative and reach out to Mia. But if she does that, what should she say? If she shares her feelings, would Mia label her again as being too sensitive? What if Aniyah expresses her opinion that the fight was all Mia’s fault? Wouldn’t that make it even worse? She has numerous choices, but each has potential costs.





Mia and Aniyah, Part 2


As Aniyah drove home that night and thought about the dinner conversation, she got more and more upset. By the time she pulled into her driveway, she was in tears. Her husband, Christopher, met her at the door. The more she described what happened, the worse she felt. She concluded, “Maybe it’s time to let that friendship go. It’s more trouble than it’s worth.”

“Do you really want to give up on a twenty-five-plus-year friendship?” Christopher asked. “You two have been through a lot together.”

“Well, if the relationship is important to her, and since the disaster this evening turned into is mostly her fault, she’ll have to take the first step,” said Aniyah.

Christopher was quiet for a moment, then said, “Do you want to give up that much control and leave the outcome entirely in her hands?”

“I don’t know,” Aniyah responded. “All I know is that I’m exhausted, and I desperately need to go to bed and get a good night’s sleep.”

The next day as she drove to work, Aniyah reflected on Christopher’s comments. She and Mia had been through a lot together, and Aniyah missed their prior closeness. In fact, that loss was what upset her the most. She felt both sad and empty. She wondered whether Mia felt the same way. Relationships do end, she mused. Is that what Mia wants?

She considered reaching out to Mia but didn’t know how to frame a follow-up conversation. She still felt burned by the “Why are you so sensitive?” comment and didn’t want to raise the issue in a way that would perpetuate Mia’s view of her. She thought of calling but decided not to. I’m not sure I can control what I say, she thought, especially if she puts me down again….Instead, she decided to drop Mia an email so that she could be more thoughtful.

 That evening, Aniyah wrote Mia: “I don’t know about you, but I’m still feeling bad about how dinner went last night. We’ve had a long-standing friendship and we’ve been important to each other for many years. I don’t know how you feel, but I’d like to meet again to see what we can do. But let’s not meet for dinner. I think we need a more private place and a little more time than a hurried meal.”

The next day Mia responded: “Glad to get your email; how about meeting at noon a week from Saturday at the community gardens gazebo, which is always empty? Will that work?”

Aniyah felt relieved that Mia had responded so quickly, but there was little in her reply that indicated she was as upset as Aniyah. Am I going to come across as the needy one again? she thought. But she’d made the overture, so she responded, “Yeah, that sounds good. See you then.”

The community gardens were close to Aniyah’s house, and as she walked there the following Saturday, she was grateful that Mia had chosen a spot that would be easier for her. But she also felt nervous and worried the meeting wasn’t a good idea. What’s going to come of this? she wondered. Are we going to get anywhere or just make things worse?

Mia was already at the gazebo, and as she had predicted, no one else had claimed the space. It was a beautiful day, the temperature was perfect, and the small gazebo was cozy and inviting. Mia greeted Aniyah with a hug, sat down, and gestured for Aniyah to do so as well. “So,” Mia said, “what’s on your mind?”

“I was hoping that what’s on my mind is on yours as well.”

Mia sighed. “What is it with you?”

Aniyah felt her defenses go up immediately. “What is it with me? What is it with you? How can you be so insensitive? I feel like you don’t care about our relationship.”

Mia said, “Just because I don’t get all worked up about every little thing and don’t react the way you do doesn’t mean I’m insensitive or I don’t care!”

 “Wait,” Aniyah said. “Let’s not do this again.”

“No,” Mia agreed. “Let’s not.”

They sat in silence for a moment and then Mia asked, “What’s going on, Aniyah?”

“That’s the issue,” Aniyah said. “Why is this all on me? Aren’t you concerned about our relationship, too?”

“I never said it was all on you!” Mia said a bit defensively. Then she softened her tone. “I’m just worried. I care so much about our friendship and I feel helpless.”

“It really helps me to hear that,” said Aniyah. “But that’s the first I’ve heard that any of this is bothering you. I really don’t know how much you care about our friendship. Do you miss the intimacy and closeness we had as much as I do?”

“Of course I do. Isn’t it obvious? What do I have to do to make it clear?”

“Actually, it’s not obvious,” Aniyah said. “Take the email that I sent suggesting we meet. I took the risk of saying I felt bad about how dinner went and what it might mean for our relationship, and your response was ‘Glad to get your email.’ I had no idea if you felt like I did.”

“But I don’t understand—why do I have to say it?”

“Because it would help,” Aniyah said. “I’m not a mind reader. Look, you label me as needy and just said that I worry about every little thing. That puts me in a one-down position, as if I’m the problem person, and that label makes me feel insecure. Yes, of course I have needs, but don’t you have needs, too? Isn’t this an equal relationship?”

Mia paused for a minute to take that in, then, in a soft tone said, “Okay…I’m starting to see that now, and I’m sorry. Yes, I was upset, too, and wish I had been more explicit about it.”

After a moment of mutual silence, they both started to physically relax a bit. Then Mia added in an even softer tone, “Am I doing anything else that’s pushing you away?”

 “Well, actually, yes,” said Aniyah. “For a while now, things have been falling into place perfectly for you while I’ve been struggling, and it makes it really hard for me to be with you.”

“So I should just not talk about what’s going on for me because it’s good? Is that the only way we can be in a relationship? Do you want me to hold back big parts of my life and myself? That feels kind of one-sided to me.”

“No, of course not,” said Aniyah. “If we’re going to have a close relationship, we need to feel free to talk about all aspects of our life. Look, you accuse me of being too sensitive. On the other hand, I don’t hear you acknowledge how I might be feeling when you talk about all the expensive details of your new house—isn’t that being a bit insensitive?”

Mia started to tear up. “I’m sorry, but you’re the only person that I can fully share my success with.”

“And I want to be there for you,” Aniyah responded softly. She paused. “What’s going on? What are the tears about?”

At that, Mia let her tears flow uninhibited. “You know my background, growing up where all the other kids were from rich families. We weren’t poor, but I always had less than the others. It feels so good to be successful, and I don’t want to brag, but who else can I share this with?”

“Oh, Mia, I do want to celebrate with you.” Aniyah reached for Mia’s hand. “And believe me, I’m happy for you and want to be the person you can fully let it all hang out with.” Aniyah let that statement sit for a few minutes as she allowed Mia the space to cry.

“Still,” Aniyah said after Mia had stopped crying, “I have to admit that sometimes when we talk, it leaves me feeling even worse about the stuff that isn’t working that well in my life. I feel inadequate so often, and it’s really painful to feel that way even when I’m with one of my best friends.”

 “But what can I do?” asked Mia.

“I know you’re trying to help,” said Aniyah. “But when I share what’s going on, you give me casual advice like ‘Maybe it’s time to find a new job.’ Then when I don’t respond positively to that, you call me too sensitive. In fact, I’m sitting here worried that’s what you’ll say next, or worse, that you’re thinking that even if you don’t say it.”

“That’s hard to hear,” Mia said, “but I also get it. That’s not how I want to be with you. I had no idea how hard all this was on you. I’m so sorry I said you were too sensitive. And you’re right—I wasn’t sensitive enough.”

“Thanks so much for saying that,” said Aniyah. “That really helps. I’m feeling better understood than at dinner. If you were a casual acquaintance, this would be hard enough, but I hate the fact that I’m envious of you and I don’t know quite how to handle it.”

“I don’t know quite how to handle it either,” admitted Mia, “but I’m glad we’re talking about it openly. I feel hopeful we’ll figure it out.”





A Close Call


Mia and Aniyah broke the logjam, but it was a close call. The dinner itself could have been the last straw for either of them. Or Aniyah could have waited for Mia to take the first step in its aftermath, as she thought of doing initially. Mia also might not have responded to Aniyah’s email right away, which could have resulted in Aniyah’s giving up. Finally, the friendship could have fallen apart during the gazebo conversation, beginning as it did with accusations of insensitivity and oversensitivity.

In contentious situations like these, it’s common to get stuck because you’re afraid that opening issues up will worsen the argument. Another tendency is to oversimplify the conflict to right and wrong, believing the other person is totally at fault and that you bear no responsibility. Such oversimplification narrows the options for reconciliation, making either or both parties hesitant to move. In that state, you stop hearing each other, which makes it more difficult to move toward a productive resolution.

 When you feel hurt and distanced from someone you care about deeply, what you most need is to feel heard and fully understood—as previously noted, two key aspects of “feeling emotionally met.” In order for this to happen, though, you have to understand your own needs and feelings, and then speak those needs and feelings aloud. No one is a mind reader. Then and only then can you move into mutual problem-solving and repair.

Both Mia and Aniyah faced a series of major choice points. At each juncture they could decide to turn toward the issue, and each other, or they could turn away. They were at one such point immediately after their disastrous dinner. Fortunately, Aniyah turned toward Mia. Even though she was feeling hurt, she was willing to take the risk and increase her level of vulnerability by reaching out and writing that she was feeling bad about the dinner and that the relationship was important to her. Such vulnerability tends to result in reciprocal vulnerability, as emphasized throughout the book. However, Mia did not respond in kind in her email, which was a lost opportunity for further connection.

As they started to talk in the gazebo, they were at another choice point. They had just engaged in mutual blame, as Aniyah called Mia insensitive and Mia retaliated by claiming that at least she didn’t “get all worked up about every little thing.” This was a potentially explosive point in the conversation and the reason so many people don’t surface difficult interpersonal issues in the first place. The fear is that the charges and countercharges will escalate into increasingly damaging accusations, and then neither party will have any idea how to recover. It’s perfectly plausible that Aniyah could have gotten up and said, “I’ve had it—one hell of a friend you are,” only to have Mia respond in kind.

The key point here is that either Aniyah or Mia could have stopped the exchange from escalating. That’s indeed what happened when Aniyah said, “Wait. Let’s not do this again.”

 Fortunately, Mia responded positively. But they weren’t out of the woods yet. Especially contentious situations usually indicate multiple issues are at play, which you may not initially realize. When strong emotions such as anger get out of control, it is like throwing gasoline on a fire and leads to a major conflagration. But, if managed and understood, these strong feelings can help us see that the more emotions we feel, the more likely it is that there is something deeper going on.

Aniyah’s question “Aren’t you concerned about our relationship, too?” started to break the logjam, as Mia was able to finally disclose her feelings. “I’m just worried. I care so much about our friendship and I feel helpless.” By being somewhat vulnerable, Mia made it easier for Aniyah to share more of the issues that were bothering her. This allowed them to move into curiosity and, in doing so, to begin to understand what was behind the other’s actions and reactions. They were also more ready to name the core issues in their relationship, such as envy, and the type of support that each needed from the other.

Aniyah did something else that led to a successful turn in the conversation. In addition to sticking to her feelings, she focused on Mia’s behavior and what she found troubling. Rather than continuing the personal attacks about Mia’s insensitivity, Aniyah pointed out that Mia’s response to her email, her tendency to give advice, and her reluctance to disclose her own feelings caused problems. Remember, feedback is both more accurate and easier to hear if it is behaviorally specific, when the giver sticks with her reality.

Aniyah and Mia didn’t break the logjam perfectly, and that’s okay. Handling difficult interpersonal issues doesn’t require using exactly the right words at exactly the right time. Both Aniyah and Mia could have shared their feelings earlier (and heard the underlying feelings of the other better). They could have noticed when they were over the net. They stumbled but then caught themselves. The most valuable lesson in this exchange is the importance of persistence. At any point, they could have turned away from each other, potentially damaging the relationship further. Hanging in there and turning toward each other took patience, self-management, and a willingness to go a few rounds. But, as Mia and Aniyah found, it’s well worth the effort.





Mia and Aniyah, Part 3


Aniyah thought about Mia’s comment about her childhood. “I knew a little about your upbringing,” Aniyah said, “but even in college we didn’t talk about it that much. Sounds like there’s a lot more to it than I realized.”

Mia then really opened up. “Yeah, it was a pretty gross culture, when I think about it. All the kids wore designer clothes, vacationed in Cannes, and lived in mansions. People constantly tried to one-up each other about status. I wasn’t even in their league. I wore clothes I bought in consignment stores, I had never even been west of the Mississippi, and we lived in a tiny apartment. I’d never have other kids over, and I spent all this energy trying to hide that I really didn’t fit in.”

“Mia, I had no idea it was that tough for you,” replied Aniyah. “I can’t believe we’ve been friends for as long as we have and this was something I knew so little about. Ugh, I’m so sorry.”

Mia nodded in appreciation and continued, “When I went back to my twenty-fifth high school reunion last year, I felt equal to everyone else for the first time, like I’d finally arrived. By and large, my jobs have been better than theirs, and that felt very validating. Yet as I heard them all going on and on about their houses in the Hamptons and apartments overlooking Central Park, one-upping each other just like they used to, the last thing I felt like doing was telling them about the good things in my life. I hate that kind of bragging. I find it really distasteful and can’t stand the idea of wealth being a metric for who to befriend.” Mia paused. “And since I don’t want to brag like they do and don’t want anyone to feel belittled the way I once did, I don’t talk about all the great stuff that is going on in my life to anybody but you and Jake.” Mia started to cry.

 Aniyah felt her heart soften as she began to more fully understand Mia. She shook her head slightly and said, “How ironic that I was feeling about you the way you felt with your friends in high school. I’m so glad we’re talking about this!”

“That’s painful to hear, but it’s true,” Mia said quietly. “How ironic. I’m sorry that I did that to you.”

They both felt more relaxed and continued to chat about other childhood memories for a while. Then Aniyah suggested they might walk around the park. As they walked, Aniyah talked more about how stuck she felt at work and why hope about an impending shift in management kept her from leaving. This time, Mia nodded supportively and gave her the space to just vent.

As they continued their walk, Mia and Aniyah talked more about what they needed from each other and, in the process, reaffirmed their commitment to their friendship. Aniyah assured Mia that she really did want to give her the chance to revel in her success, and Mia promised to respond with fewer knee-jerk solutions and just listen.





Taking Responsibility


This chapter—in fact, the entire book—deals with two related statements: In almost every case, we have choices, and How the other person responds makes some choices easier and others more difficult.

Mia and Aniyah each could have prevented this conflict or more quickly moved out of it, independent of the other. Time and again, the two of us have seen students, colleagues, clients, and friends give up this freedom to act. At the same time, people do influence each other, and if we want deep relationships, we need to be aware of how we might be freeing or constraining the other as well as how their actions affect us. Remember, others can influence us, but they need not control us.

 Where these two concepts come together is around the issue of taking appropriate responsibility, not too much and not too little. In that disastrous dinner, neither Mia nor Aniyah took responsibility for what was happening—it was all the other person’s fault. Then in the process of disclosing their feelings and concerns in their subsequent meeting, they each began to take ownership for their actions as well as point out how the other’s actions made it easy or hard for them to act as their best self.

There can be danger in taking no responsibility for the other’s reaction. If Mia had said, “You’re your own person and shouldn’t have been affected by my disparaging comments,” she would not have been owning the fact that they’re in a relationship with each other. Conversely, there can be danger in taking too much responsibility, which would have happened if Mia had said, “Oh, it’s all my fault.” That would have made Aniyah out to be a helpless victim. What the two of them finally did was hold both statements as equally valid: I have a choice and I am affected by you.

It is also worth noting that sometimes it is easier to share problems than successes we want to celebrate. The latter can make us feel vulnerable, given our fear that the other person will see us as “too full of ourselves.” But part of being a good friend is being willing to be an appreciative audience and happy for you when things are going well, rather than labeling you a braggart. That is what Mia expected from Aniyah.

Once the logjam broke, Aniyah and Mia’s exchange moved them further into problem-solving and repair. They shared their backstories—the reasons why they had certain reactions or certain needs. In doing so, they surfaced multiple issues in their friendship. Initially, many people only share emotions that feel safer and are usually more superficial. That often prevents the most important issues from emerging. Instead, you have to patiently surface what’s really going on with each party. Mia and Aniyah were only able to do this once they worked out a series of agreements that allowed each to be more fully herself and fully supported by the other.

—

 It’s possible that Mia and Aniyah could have had a pleasant dinner without this conflict if Mia had said with compassion, “You seem so down. What’s going on?” Or if Aniyah had said, “You know, Mia, I don’t find your suggestion helpful,” Mia would probably have said, “Sorry,” and changed the subject. This would have been a way of handling the pinch in real time and avoided their kerfuffle. It might have made for a nicer evening…but they would not have had the conflict that surfaced so many issues that ultimately brought them closer.

Even though conflict can feel stressful and even dangerous, it can actually be helpful. Conflict can surface issues in a very direct way. It can bring out emotions, indicating what’s really going on so you know where others stand. In Mia and Aniyah’s situation, where several incidents had built up, the conflict brought them all to light, where they could be dealt with. Their disagreement, as painful as it was, forced them to identify what really mattered most to each of them. Their ability to deal with the issues not only led to a productive resolution but also reaffirmed their commitment to each other and to their friendship. They were able to turn an initially negative interaction into a positive outcome. Being able to use conflict productively is a complex issue that we will explore in greater detail in the next chapter.





Deepen Your Learning


SELF-REFLECTION


Put yourself first in Aniyah’s and then in Mia’s shoes. Look over what they shared: How easy/challenging would it be for you to disclose all they did? Are there ways in which you might have gotten stuck? Then reflect further on how you might have handled the situation.



Being One-Down: It is challenging to take the initiative when you feel in a one-down position. Putting yourself in Aniyah’s place once again, how hard would it have been for you to be vulnerable? Have there been times in a conflict situation where you have felt one-down and waited for the other person to make the first move? What did you do? What insights do you have about yourself from your answer to these questions?



Key Relationships: Think of specific incidents when one of your key relationships did something where you felt one-down. What was the incident and how did you respond?



Being One-Up: Do you think you might be doing something that makes one of your key relationships feel one-down or causes them to have a difficult time being vulnerable with you?





APPLICATION


In the third and fourth questions above, you may have identified relationships where you or the other may have felt one-down. Discuss this with them and what you can both do to change that.





MAKING SENSE


What did you learn from these discussions on vulnerability? Did they increase the extent to which you were each willing to be vulnerable with the other? What did you learn about what you need to do to make it easier for the other person to be vulnerable? How easy was it for you to be vulnerable?
