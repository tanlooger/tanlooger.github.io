title: Part 2 The Weapon Master

Empty hours, empty days.

| find that | have few memories of that first period of my -

life, those first sixteen years when | labored as a servant. Minutes blended into hours, hours into days, and So on, un- til the whole of it seemed one long and barren moment. Sev- eral times | managed to sneak out onto the balcony of House Do'Urden and look out over the magical lights of Menzober- ranzan. On all of those secret journeys, | found myself en- tranced by the growing, and then dissipating, heat-light of Narbondel, the time-clock pillar Looking back on that now, on those long hours watching the glow of the wizard's fire slowly walk its way up and then down the pillar; | am amazed at the emptiness of my early days.

| clearly remember my excitement, tingling excitement, each time | got out of the house and set myself into position to observe the pillar Such a simple thing it was, yet so fulfill. ing compared to the rest of my existence.

Whenever | hear the crack of a whip, another memory- more a sensation than a memory actually-sends a shiver through my spine. The shocking jolt and the ensuing numb- ness from those snake-headed weapons is not something that any person would soon forget. They bite under your skin, sending waves of magical energy through your body, waves that make your muscles snap and pull beyond their limits.

Yet | was luckier than most. My sister Vierna was near to becoming a high priestess when she was assigned the task of rearing me and was at a period of her life where she pos- sessed far more energy than such a job required. Perhaps, then, there was more to those first ten years under her care than | now recall. Vierna never showed the intense wicked- ness of our mother-or, more particularly; of our oldest sis- ter Briza. Perhaps there were good times in the solitude of the house chapel, it is possible that Vierna allowed a more gentle side of herself to show through to her baby brother.

Maybe not. Even though | count Vierna as the kindest of my sisters, her words drip in the venom of Lloth as surely as those of any cleric in Menzoberranzan. It seems unlikely that she would risk her aspirations toward high priestes- shood for the sake of a mere child, a mere male child.

Whether there were indeed joys in those years, obscured in the unrelenting assault of Menzoberranzan's wicked- ness, or whether that earliest period of my life was even

more painful than the years that followed-so painful that my mind hides the memories-| cannot be certain. For all my efforts, | cannot remember them.

| have more insight into the next six years, but the most prominent recollection of the days | spent serving the court of Matron Malice-aside from the secret trips outside the house-is the image of my own feet. A page prince is never allowed to raise his gaze.
