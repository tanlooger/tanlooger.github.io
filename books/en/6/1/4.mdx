title: Part 4 Guenhwyvar
---

What eyes are these that see

The pain | know in my innermost soul? What eyes are these that see

The twisted strides of my kindred,

Led on in the wake of toys unbridled: Arrow, bolt, and sword tip?

Yours. .. aye, yours,

Straight run and muscled spring,

Soft on padded paws, sheathed claws, Weapons rested for their need, Stained not by frivolous blood

Or murderous deceit.

Face to face, my mirror,

Reflection in a still pool by light. Would that | might keep that image Upon this face mine own.

Would that | might keep that heart Within my breast untainted.

Hold tight to the proud honor of yo Mighty Guenhwyvar,

And hold tight to my side,

My dearest friend.

-Drizzt Do'Urden
