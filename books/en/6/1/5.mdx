title: Part 5 Zaknafein
---

Zaknafein Do'Urden: mentor; teacher; friend. |, in the blind agony of my own frustrations, more than once came to recognize Zaknafein as none of these. Did | ask of him more than he could give? Did | expect perfection of a tor- mented soul; hold Zaknafein up to standards beyond his ex- periences, or standards impossible in the face of his experiences?

| might have been him. | might have lived, trapped within the helpless rage, buried under the daily assault of the wick- edness that is Menzoberranzan and the pervading evil that is my own family; never in life to find escape.

It seems a logical assumption that we learn from the mis- takes of our elders. This, | believe, was my salvation. With- out the example of Zaknafein, |, too, would have found no escape-not in life.

Is this course | have chosen a better way than the life Zaknafein knew? | think, yes, though | find despair often

enough sometimes to long for that other way. It would have been easier. Truth, though, is nothing in the face of self- falsehood, and principles are of no value if the idealist can- not live up to his own standards.

This, then, is a better way.

| live with many laments, for my people, for myself, but mostly for that weapon master; lost to me now, who showed me how-and why-to use a blade.

There is no pain greater than this; not the cut of a jagged- edged dagger nor the fire of a dragon's breath. Nothing burns in your heart like the emptiness of losing something, someone, before you truly have learned of its value. Often now | lift my cup in a futile toast, an apology to ears that cannot hear:

To Zak, the one who inspired my courage.
