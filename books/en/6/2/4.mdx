title: Part 4 HELPLESS
---

There have been many times in my life when | have felt helpless. It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know, founded in frustration and ventless rage. The nick of a sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip. Even if the whip does not strike the helpless prisoner's body, it surely cuts deeply at his soul.

We all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives, prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us. It is a burden that all people endure, that all people despise, and that few people ever learn to escape. | consider myself fortunate in this respect, for my life has traveled along a fairly straight-running path of improvement. Beginning in Menzoberranzan, under the relentless scrutiny of the evil Spider Queen's high priestesses, | suppose that my situation could only have improved.

In my stubborn youth, | believed that | could stand alone, that | was strong enough to conquer my enemies with sword and with principles. Arrogance convinced me that by sheer determination, | could conquer helplessness itself. Stubborn and foolish youth, | must admit for when | look back on those years now, | see quite clearly that rarely did | stand alone and rarely did | have to stand alone. Always there were friends, true and dear, lending me support even when | believed | did not want it and even when | did not realize they were doing it.

Zaknafein, Belwar, Clacker, Mooshie, Bruenor Regis, Cattie-brie, Wulfgar and of course, Guenhwyvar dear Guenhwyvar: These were the companions who justified my principles, who gave me the strength to continue against any foe, real or imagined. These were the companions who fought the helplessness, the rage, and frustration.

These were the friends who gave me my life.
