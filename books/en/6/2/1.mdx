title: Part 1 THE HUNTER
---

| remember vividly the day | walked away from the city of my birth, the city of my people. All the Underdark lay before me, a life of adventure and excitement, with possibilities that lifted my heart. More than that, though, | left Menzoberranzan with the belief that | could now live my life in accordance with my principles. | had Guenhwyvar on my side and my scimitars belted on my hips. My future was my own to determine.

But that drow, the young Drizzt Do'Urden who walked out of Menzoberranzan on that fated day, barely into my fourth decade of life, could not begin to understand

the truth of time, of how its passage seemed to slow when the moments were not shared with others. In my youthful exuberance, | looked forward to several centuries of life.

How do you measure centuries when a single hour seems a day and a single day seems a year?

Beyond the cities of the Underdark, there is food for those who know how to find it and safety for those who know how to hide. More than anything else, though, beyond the teeming cities of the Underdark, there is solitude.

As | became a creature of the empty tunnels, survival became easier and more difficult all at once. | gained in the physical skills and experience necessary to live on. | could defeat almost anything that wandered into my chosen domain, and those few monsters that | could not defeat, | could surely flee or hide from. It did not take me long, however, to discover one nemesis that | could neither defeat nor flee. It followed me wherever | went-indeed, the farther | ran, the more it closed in around me. My enemy was Solitude, the interminable, incessant silence of hushed corridors.

Looking back on it these many years later, | find myself amazed and appalled at the changes | endured under such an existence. The very identity of every reasoning being is defined by the language, the communication, between that being and others around it. Without that link, | was lost. When | left Menzoberranzan, | determined that my life would be based on principles, my strength adhering to unbending beliefs. Yet after only a few months alone in the Underdark, the only purpose for my survival was my survival. | had become a creature of instinct, calculating and cunning but not thinking, not using my mind for anything more than directing the newest kill.

Guenhwyvar saved me, | believe. The same companion that had pulled me from certain death in the clutches of monsters unnumbered rescued me from a death of emptiness-less dramatic, perhaps, but no less fatal. | found myself living for those moments - when the cat could walk by my side, when | had another living creature to hear my words, strained though they had become. In addition to every other value, Guenhwyvar became my time clock, for | knew that the cat could come forth from the Astral Plane for a half-day every other day.

Only after my ordeal had ended did | realize how critical that one-quarter of my time actually was. Without Guenhwyvar, | would not have found the resolve to continue. | would never have maintained the strength to survive.

Even when Guenhwyvar stood beside me, | found myself growing more and more ambivalent toward the fighting. | was secretly hoping that some denizen of the Underdark would prove stronger than |. Could the pain of tooth or talon be greater than the emptiness and the silence?

| think not.
