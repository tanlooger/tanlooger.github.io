Acclaim for Richard Yates’s

REVOLUTIONARY ROAD

“Every phrase reflects to the highest degree integrity and stylistic mastery. To read Revolutionary Road is to have forced upon us a fresh sense of our critical modern shortcomings: failures of work, education, community, family, marriage . . . and plain nerve.”

— The New Republic

“Richard Yates is a writer of commanding gifts.

His prose is urbane yet sensitive, with passion and irony held deftly in balance. And he provides unexpected pleasures in a flood of freshly minted phrases and in the thrust of sudden insight, precise notation of feeling, and mordant unsentimental perceptions.”

— Saturday Review

“A powerful treatment of a characteristically American theme, which might be labeled

‘trapped.’ . . . A highly impressive performance.

It is written with perception, force and awareness of complexity and ambiguity, and it tells a moving and absorbing story.” — The Atlantic Monthly
