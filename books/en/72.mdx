Introduction

Wrinkled, toothless and ambling with a ponderous gait, it seems unlikely at first glance that the giant Galápagos tortoise could teach us anything about ageing gracefully. They are eponymous inhabitants of the remote Galápagos Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific which draws its name from the old Spanish word galápago, meaning ‘tortoise’. These cumbersome reptiles can weigh over 400 kilograms, and take decades to reach maturity on a diet of leaves and lichens.

The Galápagos Islands were made famous after Charles Darwin visited in 1835, and their unique flora and fauna inspired his theory of evolution by natural selection. The giant tortoises were one of the many unusual species which greeted him, and he collected several specimens to return to England for further study. One of those tortoises, Harriet, went on to become the oldest recorded Galápagos tortoise – she finally succumbed to a heart attack in 2006 at the ripe old age of 175, surviving Darwin by well over a century.

However, it’s not their impressive longevity which is most interesting when it comes to the biology of ageing; you could make the case that these tortoises’ extreme long life is down to their slow pace of living rather than any special biological abilities – the candle which burns half as bright burns twice as long, so to speak. Far more interesting is that Galápagos tortoises, along with a few other species of tortoises and turtles, some fish, salamanders, and a handful of other, stranger creatures, display what’s called ‘negligible senescence’ – a negligible loss of capacity as they age. Negligibly senescent animals have no obvious impairments of movement or senses as they get older, and they experience no age-related decline in fertility. Harriet was likely pretty much as sprightly at 170 as she was at 30, at the height of Queen Victoria’s reign – which is to say, not very; she was a giant tortoise, after all.

We humans are not so lucky. As we advance in years, we become wrinkled, frail and at increased risk of illness. Perhaps the most striking way to summarise our increasing frailty is to examine how our risk of death changes with time. Tortoises, being negligibly senescent, have a risk of death which is more or less constant with age：as adults, they have an approximately 1–2 per cent chance of dying every year. We, by contrast, have a risk of death which doubles every eight years. This doesn’t start out so bad：aged 30, your odds of dying that year are less than 1 in 1,000. However, if you keep on doubling something it can start small but, eventually, get very large very quickly：at 65, your risk of death that year is 1 per cent; at 80, 5 per cent; and by 90, if you make it that far, your odds of not making your 91st birthday are a sobering one in six. There is some evidence that this relationship flattens out after the age of 105 or so, meaning that these exceptionally long-lived people might have technically stopped ageing – but, with odds of death around 50 per cent per year by then, they might wish it had flattened out slightly sooner.

We enjoy a relatively long period of fitness, perhaps five or six decades where our risk of death, disease and disability is fairly low, before a precipitous rise in old age. Ageing happens to all of us and growing old brings experience and wisdom; to do so gracefully is something to aspire to. Since the dawn of life, ageing has been a natural part of being alive. Thus, the word ‘ageing’ comes with a variety of connotations, not all of them negative. But, from a biological perspective, perhaps the best (and certainly the simplest) definition of ageing is the exponential increase in death and suffering with time.

By this biological definition, tortoises don’t age – they are, quite literally, ageless. This means that negligible senescence is sometimes known by another, more beguiling name：‘biological immortality’. How do tortoises get old without getting elderly? And, with the help of science, could we become ageless, too?

Modern science, particularly in the last couple of decades, has made huge strides in both our understanding of and our ability to intervene in the ageing process. Ageing impacts our biology at every level, from molecules, to cells, to organs, to whole systems. I want to show you what is happening biologically as we age, and how understanding its scientific implications could lead to a complete transformation of medical care.

Understanding ageing could have enormous implications because it is by far the world’s leading cause of death and suffering. While that might sound counter-intuitive, looking at ageing as a biological process makes the logic inescapable. As we age, our bodies accrue a familiar array of changes – from the superficial, like grey hair, wrinkles and elongating noses and ears, to the life-changing, like frailty, loss of memory and the risk of deadly diseases. The fundamental reason that our risk of death rises so swiftly is a rapid, synchronised increase in the odds of age-related disease. Even if you’re relaxed about death itself – we all have to go sometime, after all – then this risk of death is still a proxy for years of suffering at the hands of disability and disease which we would probably all rather avoid.

Every extra year you live, your risk of getting cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and many more terrible conditions increases inexorably. Doctors and scientists call anything that increases your chance of getting a disease a ‘risk factor’：these are things like smoking, being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and so on. But simply getting older, no matter how well you live, dwarfs their effects. In fact, being old is the single biggest risk factor for all of the diseases just mentioned. An 80-year-old is 60 times more likely to die than a 30-year-old – so, too, are they 30 times more likely to get cancer, and 50 times more likely to get heart disease. Having high blood pressure doubles your risk of having a heart attack; being 80 rather than 40 multiplies your risk by ten. Dementia is extremely rare under the age of 60 but, after that, risk doubles every five years – even faster than the rising risk of death. From the perspective of disease risk at least, it’s better to be an overweight, heavy-drinking, chain-smoking 30-year-old than a clean-living 80-year-old.

The end result of these synchronised increases in risk is a huge burden of disease. Half of people aged 65 have two or more long-term conditions. The average 80-year-old suffers from around five different diseases and takes a similar number of different types of medication for them. Even though it’s entered into idiom, it’s not really possible to ‘die of old age’：instead, these diseases develop and progress until eventually one of them becomes severe enough to take your life.

Then, there are changes that mean it’s easier for you to get ill in other ways, and make it dramatically worse when you do. For example, as we age, our immune system weakens, and loses its edge at fighting infection. That can mean that a bout of the flu, which meant a week in bed as a youth, might be the end of you as a pensioner. Similarly, a broken bone might mean an annoying stint hobbling around wearing a plaster cast for a young person, but weeks in a hospital bed and a debilitating loss of muscle mass for an older person, making returning to normal life afterwards difficult or impossible.

Finally, there are the symptoms which quietly eat away at quality of life：a loss of mental acuity, forgetfulness or increasing anxiety which doesn’t meet the threshold for dementia; a decrease in muscle strength, plus conditions like rheumatism and arthritis, which reduce our ability to get about or do things around the house on our own; and embarrassing and inconvenient changes, from impotence to incontinence. Together, even if you’ve not got a specific disease to diagnose, these combine to sap our independence, self-esteem, enjoyment of life and contribution to society as our years advance.

We’re used to considering every item in this laundry list of diseases and dysfunctions as an individual condition, largely separate from the others. Our approach to medicine is correspondingly idiosyncratic, with drugs and operations for cancer and heart disease, vaccines to prevent infections, and walking sticks and social care to help with everyday life.

The root cause, the ageing process itself, we ignore entirely.

The universality of ageing means that it has enormous consequences：imagine the life-changing effects of getting older on an individual – the decreasing independence and quality of life, coupled with the dramatically increasing risk of disease and death – multiplied by billions of people. Nor does it just affect those who are old and infirm today：most of us at some stage will need to care for an elderly friend or relative. The effects of ageing reverberate around society, impacting all of our lives.

About 150,000 people die every day on Earth. Over 100,000 of them die because of ageing. This means that, globally, ageing is responsible for more than two-thirds of deaths – and over 90 per cent in rich countries. Tens of millions suffer over years or decades as their health deteriorates. A natural disaster on this scale would be utterly unprecedented. A huge and immediate international relief effort would be mounted, even if success was uncertain. If a disease with these symptoms were to suddenly arise in a previously ageless civilisation, Herculean efforts to cure it would begin as soon as possible.

But its ubiquity also means that ageing is the default; its inevitability makes it invisible. We see individual tragedies as friends and relatives age, and acknowledge the horror of the specific diseases that afflict them – but society is collectively casual about ageing itself. This rolling worldwide pandemic of death and suffering goes unrecognised, too large to grasp, obscured by its own enormity.

We humans are beset by a cocktail of cognitive biases which emphasise the here and now and minimise the distant future. Most of us don’t save enough for our pensions and find it hard to stick to diets or exercise regimes. Human beings are also wired for optimism. We might picture ourselves grey-haired, retired, taking up new hobbies or playing with our grandchildren. We don’t picture being in hospital with an IV line and a bladder catheter. Research shows that we don’t deny the existence of cancer or heart attacks – just that few people believe it will happen to them. We also tend to extrapolate from previous experience. Thankfully, most of us don’t experience multiple simultaneous chronic diseases before we get old; when we picture our retirement, we don’t imagine being ill simply because we’ve not got much to go on.

We are also insulated from the consequences of ageing when it happens to other people. The oldest and most unwell are tucked away in hospitals and nursing homes, hidden from view. When we are children, our grandparents are often kind, wrinkly souls whose health problems we aren’t really aware of. Even as adults with fledgling careers and a young family, we rarely get involved caring for older friends and relatives. That responsibility usually falls either to our own parents stepping in to look after their mum and dad, or our grandparents themselves taking care of one another. All this means we usually don’t get to see the full picture until our parents, or even our partners, need taking care of – by which time we’re starting to age ourselves. While these are gross generalisations which will vary from family to family, they are borne out by statistics：a US survey found that those caring for someone over 65 had an average age of 63 themselves. We can easily make it through the first four, five or even six decades of life without having to confront what ageing means – which makes it all the easier to put from our minds.

If we do think about what our lives might be like in 10, 20, 50 years’ time, we can allay our anxieties by telling ourselves that we are fortunate. Ageing is a curse that we in the rich world are perversely lucky to have; we live long enough for it to be a problem. Better to live a long life and die from a heart attack than die in childhood of malaria, right? It is, of course – and the fact that deaths from diseases like malaria are in significant part preventable makes their continued death toll a moral indictment – but the bittersweet news is that age-related diseases outgun other causes of death in over three-quarters of countries around the world.

Global life expectancy was 72.6 years in 2019, and it’s rising. If you already knew that, you’re in the minority：in spite of our optimism about our own individual futures, surveys show that most people are pessimistic about the state of the world, and assume that life expectancy is 10 or even 20 years lower. Most of us imagine a large ‘developing world’ where birth rates and death rates are high – this is, after all, what we were taught at school. The reality is that most countries are approaching the developed world, in life expectancy if not in wealth. This is astonishing progress, and well worth celebrating – we’ve beaten many deadly infectious diseases into submission, and improved quality and quantity of life worldwide. The flip side is that 70 is easily old enough to feel the effects of ageing – this is another way to understand why age-related conditions are the greatest cause of death and suffering worldwide.

Ageing is also a crisis which is snowballing as development continues and our global population gets older：even if it somehow fails to meet the definition of a global challenge now, it surely will do so in decades to come. The question is, what can we do?

The answer, thankfully, is biology. It all started in the 1930s, with a breakthrough that changed scientific history. There was a burgeoning interest in the new field of nutrition, and researchers were starting to wonder about the effects of food on growth and lifespan. Scientists took three groups of rats, one allowed to eat what they liked, and the other two on significantly more frugal diets, all while meticulously ensuring that they got all the nutrients they needed. The rats eating less were smaller than those in group one but, as the experiment progressed, it became obvious that their size wasn’t the only thing being affected by their reduced rations. One by one, the rats eating what they liked got old and died, while the dieting rats kept going, and going. And these hungry rats didn’t hobble along in ill health, grey-haired and cancer-ridden, somehow unable to muster the energy even to die after their better-fed counterparts had done so. The calorie-restricted animals were healthier and less frail for longer, too. It seemed almost as though eating less slowed down the ageing process itself.

It turns out that this wasn’t a fluke, or experimental error. We’ve since tried dietary restriction in creatures from all over the tree of life, with astonishing generalisability：single-celled yeast (the fungus used in baking and brewing beer), worms, flies, fish, mice, dogs and many more all live longer and healthier if fed significantly less than normal. They are more active, and suffer less from the ailments of ageing, from cancer to heart trouble (at least in those creatures that have hearts). Dietarily restricted rats even have better fur than animals with a normal food intake. It’s possible to cut their food too far, which obviously leads to starvation – but, get things just right, and hungrier rats will significantly outlive members of their species who eat what they like, in significantly better health. These findings show us something remarkable：ageing is not some rigid, immutable biological inevitability. A deceptively simple treatment can slow down almost everything about it, all at once, across the animal kingdom.

What seemed for the vast majority of human history to be a fixed fact of nature can in fact be altered by just eating less. What’s more, ageing seems to be, on some level, a coherent process：these extreme diets don’t just prevent a single age-related disease, but all of them at once, at the same time as deferring frailty and death. That means it’s not impossible to imagine that we could come up with medicines that could slow down or even reverse ‘ageing’ writ large, not just its individual components. Though it wouldn’t be so christened for a few more decades, this was the birth of biogerontology：the study of the biology of ageing.

With hindsight, the fact that ageing is at least somewhat coherent should be obvious. The fact that we start to suffer simultaneously from a diverse family of ailments, each with their own complex underlying causes, should set off scientific alarm bells. The clogged arteries of heart disease, the dying brain cells in dementia and the out-of-control cells of cancer don’t seem to have much in common – so why do they all happen at once? It might just seem like a cruel coincidence, if it weren’t for our long-lived, hungry rats in which all of these are delayed together：what this suggests is that there is an underlying, ticking clock which, with surprising synchrony, unleashes a phalanx of terrible diseases on our bodies.

The fact that ageing is malleable could save and improve billions of lives. The aim of anti-ageing medicine is to replicate in people what we’ve seen at work in so many dietarily restricted species：to keep us fit and disease-free for longer. This is sometimes referred to as increasing ‘healthspan’ – prolonging the period of life lived without disease or disability.

Dietary restriction is just the beginning. After all, when the first results were published in 1935, we didn’t know the structure of DNA – in fact, back then we weren’t even entirely sure that DNA was the medium of heredity. Nowadays, we can read an organism’s entire DNA sequence in a few hours. Our understanding of how life works has expanded exponentially, thanks to an array of biological tools and techniques which would have sounded fantastical a century ago. Our modern understanding of ageing biology, like all science, comes from researchers standing on the shoulders of their forebears – and research into ageing runs the gamut from ecology to lab biology.

There’s inspiration to be drawn from the diversity of life on Earth, involving an ensemble cast of incredible animals which, it turns out, age at remarkably different rates. We’ve already met negligibly senescent tortoises which have mastered biological immortality. How could they evolve when ageing seems universal? Even if we stick to animals more closely related to us, mammals have lifespans ranging from just a few months for some unfortunate kinds of rodent to probably centuries in the case of whales. How has this diversity of lifespans evolved, and what tricks might these creatures be able to teach us about how to age well?

Then, there’s what we know from the lab. We’ve uncovered huge results in tiny nematode worms：a change in a single gene, indeed a single letter of DNA, can extend a worm’s lifespan tenfold. We’ve also had success in animals with physiologies far closer to our own：we can routinely improve the ageing process in mice via dozens of different treatments. We’ve discovered drugs which can slow ageing, or turn back the clock entirely, some of which are already being tried in patients.

This collection of observations and evidence is tantalising and foreshadows a future where ageing will be treated. And this future may not be so far away：in the last decade or two we have finally been able to say with confidence what ageing is. And once you know what something is, you can start to work in earnest to target it.

We now think that ageing isn’t a single process, but a collection of biological changes which make old organisms different from young ones. These phenomena impact every part of us – from genes and molecules to cells and whole systems inside our body – and go on to cause the aches and pains, worsening sight, wrinkles and diseases of the elderly. We are now at a stage where we can draw up a list of these changes and conceive treatments to slow or reverse each of them.

The ideas for treating ageing processes aren’t pie-in-the-sky theoretical biology – they are being tested in labs and hospitals around the world today. One such phenomenon is the accumulation of aged ‘senescent’ cells in our bodies. Few in number in our youth and accumulating with time, senescent cells are associated with a number of age-related diseases. In 2011, the removal of these cells in mice was shown to defer multiple diseases and extend lifespan. By 2018, drugs which destroy these cells were undergoing clinical trials in people.

The dream of anti-ageing medicine is treatments that would identify the root causes of dysfunction as we get older, then slow their progression or reverse them entirely. They would address many conditions at once, and would also be preventative rather than palliative – reducing your odds of getting diseases, and tackling the more everyday symptoms like wrinkles and hair loss at the same time. We wouldn’t wait until patients were old and sick to start with treatment, as we do today; instead, we’d give them in advance, and stop people from becoming ill and infirm in the first place.

Treating ageing itself rather than individual diseases would be transformative. Much of modern medicine targets symptoms, or at least takes aim at factors several steps removed from the root cause of many illnesses. For example, if someone has high blood pressure (as many people do, especially as they get older), they will often be prescribed medication to lower it. Many common blood pressure drugs work by relaxing the muscles around the arteries, causing them to widen, and allowing blood to flow more freely. This doesn’t address the stiffening of the artery walls, or the clogging of their interiors which are actually causing the rise in blood pressure. It’s not that these treatments are useless – blood pressure is reduced by these pills, and patients live longer as a result – but these drugs and others are workarounds and, ultimately, they can never be a cure.

Medicine for ageing itself could rejuvenate aged vessels and restore blood pressure to safe, youthful levels for the long term – and those same medicines would improve other aspects of our ageing physiology, too. The same biological processes which cause our blood vessels to stiffen are behind other problems, from arthritis to wrinkles; fixing root causes helps with many problems at once. Not only that, but truly controlling high blood pressure would go on to reduce the odds of further problems, from kidney disease to dementia, which are caused when blood pressure is high for prolonged periods. The changes which happen in our molecules, cells, organs and bodies as a whole as we age are why we are so susceptible to disability and disease – identify and learn to treat them, and the ill health of later life can be postponed.

Though we’ve enjoyed significant success by treating diseases separately, this approach can’t add much more to life expectancy：even a hypothetical complete success at curing a single disease has a counter-intuitively small effect on health. Demographers can use mathematical models to simulate the total eradication of particular diseases and see what happens to life expectancy and disease burden overall. These calculations show that a complete cure for cancer – currently the leading cause of death – would add less than three years to life expectancy. The numbers for runner-up heart disease are similarly slight：two years at best. The reason for this is simple：if cancer or heart disease don’t get you, there are plenty of other diseases waiting in the wings to end your life a few months or years later. And curing cancer, heart disease and all the other diseases which are consequences of ageing wouldn’t address consequences that we don’t currently label as diseases – the frailty, the forgetfulness, the loss of independence, and so on. Medicine which tackles the underlying causes of ageing would lessen both the risk of disease and the other symptoms of growing old.

This will be the greatest revolution in medical care since antibiotics. Penicillin is a single drug, and yet it can be used to treat a wide range of diseases. The same will be true of treatments for ageing – but instead of warding off external threats like bacteria, medicine for ageing will target our bodies’ own internal degeneration with time.

Even if we can’t cure ageing in time for ourselves, investing in ageing research is an investment in future generations. You only have to invent a new drug or treatment once, and then everyone on the planet, and everyone yet to be born, can go on to benefit from it. Cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, infectious diseases, frailty, incontinence and many, many more – progress on any one of which would be a cause for celebration – could be delayed and maybe defeated together. The legacy of our generation could be treatments for ageing which will benefit every generation to come. Initiating the scientific and cultural shift necessary to acknowledge that ageing as an entity should be treated could well be the single most consequential thing we do.

The consequences will be profound and wide-ranging, for all of us personally, for our friends and families, and for society and humanity as a whole, and the benefits will far outweigh the costs. Many people’s initial reaction to the idea of treating ageing is cautious, or even hostile：we wonder what the consequences of longer lifespans will be for population growth or the environment; if treatments for ageing would primarily benefit the rich and powerful; or whether dictators could live forever, imposing endless totalitarianism. However, almost any objection can be answered by turning the question around, and replacing it with a simple hypothetical alternative：if we lived in a society where there was no ageing, would you invent ageing to solve one of these problems?

Would creating ageing and condemning billions to suffering and death be a viable answer to climate change, or global overuse of resources? Surely we’d find other ways to reduce our collective footprint on the planet before resorting to such barbarism. Similarly, invoking ageing to limit the reign of even a particularly despotic ruler is a plan which goes far beyond the craziest CIA assassination plots. Looking at things this way around, the answer is clear：ageing isn’t a morally acceptable solution to any serious problem. This means that the converse is also true：arguing to leave ageing intact in an attempt to avoid other problems is misguided when ageing itself carries a huge human cost.

If the conclusion that we should try to defeat ageing seems strange, I think that’s in large part because of our understandable comfort and familiarity with how things are. We literally get a lifetime to come to terms with growing old, and the place we most often imagine longer lifespans is dystopian science fiction. Our sympathy for the status quo blinds us to how powerful the case for curing ageing is – as strong as the case against creating it would be if it didn’t already exist.

The moral case for treating ageing is underlined by a family of conditions known as progerias, from the Greek for prematurely old. Sufferers experience symptoms of ageing at an accelerated pace：patients look old way before their time, with thinning skin and grey hair manifesting as early as childhood in the most severe forms. People born with Hutchinson–Gilford progeria have a life expectancy of 13 years, and usually die of heart disease – a problem which is otherwise unheard of in teenagers. Another related disease, Werner syndrome, sees patients get cataracts and osteoporosis in their twenties and thirties, before dying of a heart attack or cancer at an average age of 54. These conditions are perhaps the best argument for calling ageing a disease, and treating it like one – if this collection of problems is labelled a disease when they appear early, how is it different when it happens at what’s currently the ‘normal’ time?

I want to convince you that we should unashamedly aim to cure ageing. I’m not saying ‘cure’ because I necessarily think it will happen soon, or all at once, but because I want to normalise an idea which can at first sound jarring. The first treatments for ageing will slightly increase our healthspans and maybe our lifespans, too, and that’s great. But we shouldn’t stop there – what we should aim for is negligible senescence：a risk of death, disability, frailty and illness which doesn’t depend on how long ago you were born. Our chronological age would no longer be the defining number by which we live our lives – we would, as individuals and as a civilisation, be ageless. That is what a real cure for ageing would look like, and it’s something we could and should aim for as a species.

Curing ageing doesn’t mean living forever, but it would lead to a substantial decrease in suffering. Lifespans would increase as a side effect, just as they would if we cured cancer, diabetes or HIV, none of which we are ashamed to aim for. If we did completely cure ageing, all it would mean is a risk of death which stays constant no matter how chronologically old you are, rather like a giant tortoise. You could still die of an infection or in a road accident, meaning that immortality is not on the cards for a while yet (though hopefully longer lives would lead us to be increasingly proactive in reducing deaths from these preventable causes, too). A cure for ageing would change what it means to be human – but, at the same time, it’s simply a natural extension of the goals of modern medicine.

This is a hugely exciting time to be alive. Removing the aged, senescent cells we just briefly mentioned went from lab experiment to entirely new treatment paradigm in less than a decade. There are many other ideas which slow ageing in lab animals that could soon be making the same journey. Most of you reading this book should live long enough to take the first true anti-ageing treatment, whatever that turns out to be.

There are literally billions of lives at stake. This is the science that could save them.
