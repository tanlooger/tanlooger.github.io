title: 12 Barefoot Doctor
---







In 1950, the year after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the average life expectancy in China was 41.6 years. In 1960, during the Great Famine, it dropped to 31.6 years. Creating a health care system for a poor, sprawling country with more than half a billion people was a daunting task for China’s new rulers. The country suffered from a severe lack of medicine and a shortage of medical professionals. Medicine was almost absent in the rural areas, except for the scant coverage provided by traditional medicine men. The government thus attempted to improve access to health care by creating a new public health system designed to give priority to prevention over treatment.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (RCMS) established a three-tier system for rural health care access. The RCMS functioned on a prepayment plan that drew funds from individual contributions, a village collective welfare fund, and subsidies from the government.

The first tier consisted of village doctors, who were trained in basic hygiene and medicine, including Western and traditional Chinese medicine. Not every village had a doctor, but where they did exist, they provided the most basic form of health care. For any illnesses a village doctor could not treat, patients were sent to township health centers, the second tier of the RCMS, which consisted of small outpatient clinics staffed by government medical professionals. The third tier of the RCMS, the county or provincial hospitals, handled the most serious cases.

The rural areas were “lacking in doctors and short of medicine,” as a popular saying had it. Mao strongly pushed to bring medicine to the countryside by providing basic health care training to peasants and medicine men, thus promoting what became known as the “barefoot doctor” system. The name was derived from the need for these doctors to work in the paddy fields barefoot during planting season in the southern part of China. When the educated youth were sent down to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, a number of them were given basic training to become barefoot doctors.

By 1976 an estimated 1.5 million barefoot doctors served China’s rural areas, covering approximately 85 percent of the total population. Thanks largely to economic reforms and the de-collectivization of rural farms in the 1980s, however, the funding and organizational rationale of the RCMS collapsed; by 1984 barefoot doctors served just 9.6 percent of China’s population. Soon, the name “barefoot doctor” had become passé and replaced with “rural doctor.” Barefoot doctors became history, at least in name.

Today, China’s health care system consists of hospitals, including primarily public hospitals and a growing number of private medical institutions, and insurance programs. About 95 percent of the population has at least basic health insurance coverage. China is scheduled to provide affordable basic health care to all residents by 2020.

I was sitting on a little folding stool in front of our room reading. It was June 3, 1971. The windy season was over, and the sun felt comfortably warm. Suddenly, I heard someone shouting my name.

It was Little Xie, the messenger from company headquarters. He had been in our squad when he first arrived from Yuyao, a town in Zhejiang Province in the south. He was tall and handsome but introverted; he rarely spoke. Political Instructor Zhang had taken a liking to him and given him the job of messenger. Little Xie didn’t have to go to the fields anymore. Because he was now so close to the leaders, many people tried to curry favor with him. He took advantage of his enhanced status and went from one platoon to another, inviting himself to meals whenever someone returned from home leave with machine-made noodles or canned meat.

But Little Xie didn’t forget his lowly squad mates. He was a frequent visitor, sharing gossip about what was going on at headquarters. Now I greeted him warmly and asked what was new.

He looked at me mysteriously, smiling. “Instructor Zhang wants to see you,” he informed me.

“What for?” The political instructor had never summoned me before. I thought perhaps I might have done something wrong.

He wouldn’t satisfy my curiosity, or perhaps he didn’t know. “You’ll find out soon enough. He says it’s urgent.”

The company office was right behind our platoon. I stopped reading and hid my book under my pillow before going to the room the political instructor shared with the commander as both office and bedroom.

“Report!” I announced myself loudly outside the door.

“Come in.” Instructor Zhang was sitting on his bed, facing the door. Apparently, he was expecting me.

He didn’t invite me to sit down, and my heart beat nervously as I raked my brain for what offenses I might have committed unintentionally or by accident.

Finally, he spoke. “Little Shan,” he began. I was startled to hear such an intimate greeting, the first ever from the instructor. Usually, he called me by my full name. “Do you like medicine?” he asked. I was even more puzzled and did not know how to respond. I thought perhaps he was questioning my courage.

“I don’t really like medicine, but I am willing to take it when I’m sick. ‘Good medicine is bitter but beneficial to your health.’” I quoted the Chinese proverb and tried to smile.

“Do you know anything about it?” he asked. I didn’t have the foggiest idea what he was driving at, so it was useless to try to avoid trouble. I answered him directly.

“I have read some chapters from the Manual for Barefoot Doctors. I was in poor health when I was small and had all kinds of illnesses. I took a lot of different drugs.”

“Very good,” the instructor said. I still could not figure out where he was going with the conversation. Was it perhaps my knowing something about medicine or my poor health when I was small?

Now his face grew more solemn. He cleared his throat, and I knew he was going to tell me why I was there.

“The Company Branch Committee of the Communist Party has decided to make you a medic or barefoot doctor. This has been determined after lengthy discussion, based on the recommendation by Dr. Yu. You leave tomorrow morning for the regiment hospital in Batou for training for three months.” He paused, staring as if he had made an announcement on behalf of God. “Do you have any objections?”

Objections? I was almost dizzy with joy. I tried to conceal my excitement and replied carefully, reciting a line familiar to everyone from war movies. “No. I obey the decision of the Party.”

“Good. In any case, the matter has been decided.” The instructor fell silent, seemingly waiting for me to speak. But I didn’t want to express my happiness for fear that I would show “petty bourgeois sentiment” or hints of disliking hard labor in the fields. If I had known better, I would have said a few words of gratitude, but I took his words literally. I didn’t think personal thanks would be appropriate for a decision made by the Party, of which he was the physical embodiment.

Apparently disappointed by my silence, Instructor Zhang said something about living up to the trust placed in me by the Party and the leadership. Then he said, “I will expect you to give me acupuncture for my arthritis when you come back.” He lifted the corner of his mouth for the first time and dismissed me.

I was so happy that I wanted to shout and somersault. But there were people everywhere, so I hurried to find my friends to tell them the big news.

Cui Xianchao said that this was the first good decision that the company leadership had ever made. Huang Shurong teasingly asked me not to forget him when I became a man of importance. Li Rongtian was more thoughtful: he told me I should thank Dr. Yu for the nomination.

But someone said that Dr. Yu had gone to regiment headquarters. There was a rumor that he might be transferred permanently. That made sense. That was why they needed a new medic.

Dr. Yu liked people who read books. He must have seen the barefoot doctors’ manual on my bed. I could not get over the fact that although I had never exchanged more than a few words with him, he had chosen me.

The next morning, I packed my clothes and quilt. Most of my good friends took the day off from the fields to see me off. It was exciting for everyone that one of us had been chosen to become a doctor.

As it turned out, the delivery truck that I was supposed to get a ride with would not arrive until after 5 o’clock, and we had to go to the Third Company to catch it.

So off we went. I felt happy surrounded by so many friends, who were carrying my belongings and cheering me on. We had to pass through the compound on our way, and the people who had just returned from a day of hard work were hanging about waiting for the dinner whistle. I felt as if we made a parade.

When we arrived at the Third Company, the driver was off having dinner. Despite my urgings, my friends refused to go back to eat. When we finally got under way, I waved goodbye to the crowd. The driver marveled at what a friendly place my company seemed to be.

It was well after dark when we arrived in Batou. Through the headlights, I could see rows of houses just like the barracks in our company. Someone helped me with my belongings, guided me to my room, and then disappeared. I was given a room all by myself, apparently vacated when a squad was dispatched to work somewhere else. It wasn’t until after I was in bed that I realized I hadn’t had dinner. I went to sleep on an empty stomach.

At breakfast, I saw that there was much stricter rationing here, presumably because people here weren’t engaged in any types of hard labor. I was only given one piece of wotou, one bowl of corn-flour porridge, and some salty vegetables. Usually, I could eat four or five pieces of wotou, but there was no more. Well, I thought, now that I didn’t have to work in the fields, one piece was probably enough to last the morning.

I would be trained in basic medicine and taught how to treat common illnesses. The training sessions were held in a large warehouse. Most of the 20-odd students were medical workers from the regiment hospital. The rest were, like myself, from different companies. Most of them had considerable medical experience already and were here to improve their skills. I was one of the very few who had never been exposed to medicine, other than taking it.

The instructors were from the regiment hospital. Unlike barefoot doctors, who received only the most rudimentary training, these were real doctors who had had formal medical education in military medical schools.

In the first days, an instructor went over the anatomy and all the systems of a human body with the aid of a large picture. The last part of his lecture was on the reproductive system. He went through this rather perfunctorily. The vast majority of our patients, the Army Corps soldiers, would be teenagers too young to worry about reproduction. Besides, the leadership of the Nineteenth Regiment had issued an order that soldiers were “forbidden to develop a love or marital relationship” for at least three years. If we dealt with local peasants, the instructor said, it would be our duty to reduce their rate of reproduction by educating them in population control and by dispensing birth control devices.

After the “Western analysis of anatomy” class, another instructor talked about how Chinese medicine viewed the body. Instead of talking about different “systems,” Chinese medicine was based on the study of the five zang and six fu. To me, Chinese medical theory seemed much more complicated and philosophical than Western medicine. The doctor used terms similar to those in Western medicine, but they had different meanings. For example, one of the five zang of the human body was the heart. But the symptoms of “heart problems” in Chinese medicine included insomnia, mental disturbances, nosebleeds, and premature ejaculation. The concept of high blood pressure did not exist.

The anatomy classes were followed by study sessions on Chairman Mao’s works. The instructor told us that if we were armed with the theory behind Mao Zedong Thought, we would better serve our patients.

To dispel any doubt about the connection between Chairman Mao’s teachings and medicine, he related a story about “capturing the principal contradiction.”

Mao had written a long essay, “On Contradiction,” in which he espoused the concept that contradictions existed everywhere and in every problem or issue; to solve a problem, the key was to find the principal contradiction. “Once the principal contradiction is captured, everything else will be resolved as if being cut through by a sharp knife.”

The instructor said, on a hot summer day in a big city, a pedestrian suffered a heart failure and collapsed. A doctor happened to walk by, and he went over to find the man unconscious. He felt for a pulse but there was none. The situation called for immediate action. He started to apply pressure to the man’s chest but was unable to restart the heart. The only hope was direct hand massage to the heart. But that would require open-heart surgery.

Well, the instructor continued, the doctor happened to have an old pocketknife. On the spot, in front of the crowd, he used it to cut open the man’s chest. Then he applied direct massage. When the ambulance arrived, the heart was beating. In the hospital, the man was given large doses of antibiotics, for the pocketknife operation would almost surely lead to a bad infection.

“Assuming you were a trained surgeon with years of experience, would you have dared to open the chest of a patient with a pocketknife amid a crowd on the street?” the instructor asked.

We all looked at one another. Everyone knew that open-heart surgery was a major operation. It was hard to believe that someone had done it with a pocketknife on a street. Of course, none of us had ever seen that type of surgery. But even for those few who had some idea, the scene was hard to imagine. We all shook our heads in disbelief.

“Why not?” the instructor pressed us.

Someone raised his hand hesitantly. He said that first, it would be impossible to tell if a direct massage would revive the person; second, how could he stop the bleeding without any help; and third, there would be a good chance that the infection would kill the patient anyway. The risk of failure was too great.

I nodded my head in agreement.

“Risk!” the instructor exclaimed. “A revolutionary isn’t afraid of risks, because he is not concerned about himself. For a revolutionary doctor, the task is to treat the patient, regardless of the chance of losing the patient or humiliating himself before others. As for the technical problems, Chairman Mao guides us to the answer in his teachings on capturing the principal contradiction.” The instructor paused, creating an effect of suspense. Seeing that we were all listening, he continued, “There were many contradictions in this situation. If he didn’t open the chest with his pocketknife, the patient would surely die. If he did, there would be bleeding and infection. But if you compare death with bleeding and infection, which was the biggest problem?”

Obviously, it was death.

“The doctor, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, decided that death was the principal contradiction and other issues were secondary. Once the principal contradiction was resolved, other problems would in turn become principal contradictions to be dealt with. So he opened the chest. Once the man was brought back to life, the medical workers could tackle the problems of bleeding and infection. So you see,” he concluded triumphantly, “Chairman Mao’s teachings are sharper than a surgeon’s scalpel.”

I had to scratch my head at this feat of logic. I had been unaware that Chairman Mao’s teachings had such universal applications.

Dr. Yu taught the sessions on diagnostic techniques. I was very grateful to him, so I was extremely attentive. Dr. Yu was a rather serious person who seldom smiled. He would suddenly call out a name and ask the victim to interpret what he had discussed. Because of these surprise attacks, most people were a little afraid of him.

One day the subject was peritonitis, the infection of the peritoneal tissue that covers the inner stomach. Dr. Yu was describing some causes and symptoms. Toward the end of the lecture, he said that gastric puncture caused by an ulcer could also lead to peritonitis. Then he turned from the blackboard and asked:

“Could somebody tell me why gastric puncture can lead to peritonitis?” To my horror, he was looking at me.

I could feel the blood drain from my face. I was the only one who had never had any medical experience. Oh, please, Dr. Yu, I have no idea why gastric puncture can lead to peritonitis, I thought.

I heard my name. I searched Dr. Yu’s face for mercy, but there was only inquisitive gravity.

I stood, with a sense of despair. But suddenly a thought came to me. I heard my voice tremble, “A gastric puncture would cause gastric juice to leak out. Peritonitis could be caused by the irritation of the peritoneum by the gastric juice.”

I did not know if I had made any sense. But Dr. Yu smiled broadly and announced emphatically, “Absolutely correct.”

I grew dizzy from nervousness and relief. I was so happy that I hadn’t let him down—everyone knew that Dr. Yu had selected me for the course.

During the break, a young woman named Liu Ying came over and asked me how many years I had studied medicine. She could hardly believe I had never studied before.

“No wonder. I could see you were very nervous just now. You were trembling and your face was as pale as a piece of white paper. But how did you know the answer, then?” she asked.

When I told her it was intuition and logic, she shook her head in disbelief. I asked her how long she had been a barefoot doctor.

“Two years. But I haven’t studied medicine either.”

It was my turn to disbelieve. How could she practice medicine for two years without having studied it?

“Simple. At first, I just did what the military doctors asked me to do. After I had some experience, I could treat some minor problems. ‘Learn from practice,’ you know,” she said, quoting a line from Mao.

It was little wonder that there were so many “medical accidents” in the regiment and division hospitals. I had heard, for example, how a woman once had an operation on her stomach. After two weeks, her wound still had not healed, and more and more pus kept coming out. When she went back, the doctors found through an X-ray that they had left a pair of surgical scissors in her stomach. So she had another operation to retrieve the scissors. This time, they left a roll of gauze in her stomach. She had to be operated on for the third time. Li Baoquan once told me the best thing the doctors could do would be to install a zipper. That way they could open her stomach whenever they wanted.

We studied both Western and Chinese diagnostic techniques. While Western medicine relied heavily on instruments and lab tests, a doctor of Chinese medicine had to know how to bamai, to feel the pulse. The index, middle, and ring fingers were used to sense many things about the pulse, but it was very difficult for an inexperienced doctor to discern the very subtle differences. The doctor instructed us to feel each other’s pulses to practice.

This “practicing on each other” method of learning soon became a little scary. We had to give each other injections. I was not afraid to play doctor, but I was most reluctant to be practiced upon. The instructor recited Chairman Mao: “There must be sacrifice when there is a revolution.” This little sacrifice, we were told, was nothing in the service of learning useful skills for the revolution. We should feel happy. But whenever I was practiced upon, I cringed, closed my eyes, and “prayed” the words to myself over and over: “There must be sacrifices.”

To this day, I wonder how doctors learn all their techniques without being tortured or torturing others. I had saline injected into my buttocks numerous times, acupuncture all over my body, and blood drawn repeatedly from both arms. These were all unpleasant experiences. I, in turn, inflicted the same pleasure of learning upon my fellow medical students. There was only one exercise in which I absolutely refused to participate: intravenous transfusion. I couldn’t bear the thought of having my blood vessels loaded with saline. Fortunately, when I said that I would certainly pass out, the instructor spared me.

Acupuncture was a little better. Each of us practiced on ourselves. Everyone was given a small box containing different-sized needles. We were supposed to implant these on the correct points on our own bodies. I found this difficult to do. I was able to push the needle into my skin, but no matter how determined I was and how hard I pushed, I just couldn’t feel what the instructor told me I should. He said I was too tense. But how could I not be tense, pushing a needle into myself?

My first attempt to apply what I had learned of diagnostic techniques was on myself. I began to suffer from insomnia. I would be awakened by the slightest sound, such as the wind blowing past a window. At first I thought I was studying too hard without sufficient exercise, so I started to run long distances in the morning and stopped reading half an hour before bedtime. But I still could not sleep.

After consulting several books, I realized my insomnia was probably caused by malnutrition. Once I began my medical studies, I became a “person detached from production” for rationing purposes, meaning my rations were only two-thirds or less of what they had been when I belonged to the category of “person in an agricultural company.”

I had never felt that the ration for an agricultural worker was enough. The “detached from production” ration left me hungry almost all the time. Besides, our daily diet had consisted only of corn flour, sorghum, and pumpkins ever since I had first arrived, with no meat and few vegetables. That was certainly not enough nutrition for a 17-year-old.

Although I thought I had accurately diagnosed my problem, there was nothing I could do about it. If there was not enough food, there was not enough food. I wrote a long letter to my father and asked him to send me a package of food by mail, especially wheat flour, canned food, and chocolate.

The training course had been scheduled to run three months, but apparently the regiment leadership had decided that the training of a barefoot doctor did not require so much time. The instructors had to squeeze all the classes into five weeks. Just when I thought that I was getting a slight taste for the medical profession, the training was over.

Dr. Yu arranged for me to go out on a fishing boat on the last day of my stay, since Batou was located right next to Lake Wuliangsu. It was a dinghy with a sail, manned by two boys from the Eighth Company. Their job was not to catch fish, but to ship cargo to another company.

I had never been out in a boat on the lake, although we already had spent two winters cutting reeds on its frozen surface. This was summertime and there were numerous waterfowl. I expected a fun trip.

We set out early. One boy used a pole to propel the boat, while the other held the rudder. We moved slowly through thick forests of reeds. There were throngs of mosquitoes everywhere. Fortunately, we had raincoats that we used to cover our heads and arms. I was told it would be a bad idea to swim near the reeds, for the mosquitoes could kill you.

When we cleared the reeds and moved out onto the lake, the mosquitoes disappeared. There was a vastness of calm water dotted with fishing boats. The boys raised our sail and the dinghy really started to move. I felt I had stepped into a fairy tale.

We passed a fish bag, and the boys netted out some large carp. This would be our lunch. Each one weighed 5 or 6 jin (∼5 or 6 pounds). I thought that two of them would be sufficient for the three of us, but the boys smiled and said that the way they prepared the fish, the three of us would need five.

I wanted to help cook, but they told me just to watch. To my astonishment, they cut off the heads and threw the bodies back into the water. Having been hungry so often and for so long, I could hardly bear to see such senseless waste.

The boys said the most delicious part of a carp was its head. They had to throw the bodies away because there was no way to keep them fresh. But whenever they could get hold of some cooking oil they could make dried shredded fish, which was easy to store. Once we got back, they would give me some to bring back to my “poor brothers.”

The fish heads were indeed delicious. But there was not much meat on them. The boys said I must have starved to death in my previous life, because I just could not eat enough. I told them I couldn’t remember the last time I had fish. And I had never had fish so fresh.

The training class at Batou provided but the briefest introduction to medicine. I realized there was a great deal more to learn, but “learning from practice” was the only way. Fortunately, there was an advantage to practicing medicine on a farm: There was no specialization to speak of, so I got a taste of everything. If someone was sick, I had to find out what was wrong, prescribe medication, fill the prescription, sometimes administer the medicine through infusion or injection and, occasionally, if the illness was serious, nurse the patient.

Including myself, the Fifth Company now had a rather large medical force. A Dr. Yin had recently been transferred in to replace Dr. Yu. Because Dr. Yin had been accepted into a military medical school shortly before the Cultural Revolution, he was nominally a medical school graduate, although he had not received much real medical education before his school was shut down. He was in his late twenties, tall and with a flat face. He stuttered, especially when he spoke to women.

There were two other medics. One was Wang Xinquan, a boy from Tianjin. He was taller than most boys, but his mannerism was almost feminine. He spoke softly. When he walked, his hips swayed more than a woman’s.

There was also a young woman four or five years older than me named Gao Xiaorong; she was short and somewhat overweight. To be sure, most of the young women in our company looked chubby whereas most boys looked emaciated, probably, I gathered from some readings, because all we ate were carbohydrates, which were more easily turned into sugar and fat in young women than in young men.

Dr. Yin usually stayed in the company clinic. So did Gao Xiaorong. Wang Xinquan would go to the fields with the platoons occasionally. I was the only one who went to the farm field with my platoon every day. I was truly a barefoot doctor who was not “detached from production,” although in the Gobi, unlike in the rice paddy fields in the south, nobody took off their shoes when working. I enjoyed this, because I didn’t want my “poor brothers” to think that I was now different from them.

I reported my return to the political instructor as soon as I got back from Batou. He seemed pleased to see me and asked me not to forget that this opportunity to practice medicine had been given to me by the Party. I should work hard to live up to the expectations of the Party. He did not need to mention that he represented the Party. In fact, he was the Party.

“I need acupuncture for my arthritis. Gao Xiaorong is no good. When you think you are good enough, come treat me,” he said before I was dismissed.

I knew that my acupuncture skills were limited. In the hands of a good acupuncturist, a patient should not feel it when the needle goes in, and he should feel only numbness and a sense of swelling after the needle has reached the right depth. I could not achieve this effect on myself. Perhaps, as my instructor had said, this was because I could not relax.

Li Baoquan volunteered to be my guinea pig. He said gallantly, in Tianjin ruffian tradition, that he was not afraid of “stabbing both sides of his ribs with a sharp knife for the sake of his friend.” He was true to his word. Every day after dinner he would lie on the kang allowing me to plant needles all over him. When I hurt him he would curse me for being clumsy and stupid. But I was happy to see that I was making progress with my skills every day.

Soon I had settled back to the daily routines of farm life. In the morning, I would go out with the platoon to work in the fields, carrying a first-aid bag. Every evening after dinner, while the others relaxed, I went to the company clinic. I fell in love with medicine. My work was more tiring now, but I really enjoyed being able to help those who were sick.

The clinic was where I spent all my spare time. When there were no visitors, I would write down the Latin names of all the drugs we had. Dr. Yin said it was not necessary, and besides, without knowing anything about Latin and without knowing how to pronounce the long words, it would be difficult to remember so many. But I was not discouraged. I enjoyed being able to memorize them.

I remembered my promise to the political instructor to treat his arthritis. I was flattered by his insistence and I appreciated fact that he took me, a freshman in the profession, so seriously, when he could have gone to the other two barefoot doctors. After much practice on Li Baoquan, I was ready to give it a try.

I went to consult with Dr. Yin to get a better idea of the instructor’s case. Dr. Yin was strictly a doctor of Western medicine. As far as I knew, there was no cure for arthritis in Western medicine. Aspirin could help relieve the symptoms, but it would not provide a cure. Acupuncture did not promise a cure either, but it might alleviate the problem without the irritating side effect of an upset stomach from aspirin.

Dr. Yin seemed uninterested in my inquiries about the instructor’s medical history. While listening to me, he kept his eyes fixed on the cover of a medical manual. Without raising his head, he said, stuttering, “The in . . . instructor is in excellent health. He won’t be ki . . . killed by your acupuncture. So, just do whatever you want, he’ll be fine.”

I was a little annoyed. I would not have called somebody with arthritis in excellent health. Dr. Yin did not seem serious about the matter. Could it be that he was scornful of acupuncture? After some hesitation, I said, “Dr. Yin, you know I am a neophyte at this. I really need your help. It would give me a better idea of the best way to treat him if you would tell me his medical history.”

There were no such things as medical records in our camp. The company clinic was supposed to provide only basic medical help for daily ailments. Nobody ever thought it necessary to keep a record. I would not be able to find out anything about the political instructor without Dr. Yin’s help.

He moved his stare away from the medical book and smiled his typical embarrassed smile. “I cer . . . certainly would like to help you in any way I can,” he said. “But you know that there is little I can do to help him. I have given him aspirin re . . . regularly. But I . . . I think he throws away more than he takes. He said he was for . . . getful. It must be that his problem does not bother him much. The instructor is a man of much . . . much . . . much thunder but few raindrops. So don’t be too serious about it.”

I did not like what I heard. I thought that as medical professionals we should care deeply about someone’s medical problem. Obviously, there was nothing I could gain from Dr. Yin.

I took a rubber knee hammer and went to the political instructor’s bedroom. I found him and Company Commander Zhang playing poker with two young women. I felt uneasy about disturbing them and stood there with a silly smile on my face.

The political instructor raised his head and beckoned me closer. I reported that I had come to check on his knees. I said I was ready to treat him, but I could come back when he was free.

“Good, good,” he said, “Why don’t you sit down and have a game of poker with us? Are you good at Advantage?”

How dare I? What would people say if they knew I had played poker with young women in the political instructor’s room? Besides, I was not a poker player.

So I politely refused, saying that perhaps I should come back another time. I could see that the political instructor was not too pleased, but he turned to the others and said, “I knew that Little Shan would be a good barefoot doctor. See, he is now ready to treat this stubborn problem of mine. I would like to go to the fields every day with all the soldiers. But this damned arthritis troubles me all the time.”

“Political Instructor, at your advanced age, you should take more rest. Don’t risk your health with us young kids,” a young woman by the name of Wang Lianxi chimed in. She was with the cooking squad and was rumored to be a big mapijing, or ass-kisser.

I took a hard look at this woman. How could she be so shamelessly flattering? The political instructor was no more than 40, and she was talking about his advanced age. Then I caught the company commander resting his hand against her thigh. Noticing my glance, she brushed him away.

I was disgusted to see the commander’s contented smile in the midst of the women. I thought it would be best if I left.

The next day, I came back and examined the instructor’s knees. I was puzzled by what I found. Everything seemed to be all right. His reflexes were excellent. But he said that his knees were very painful and that he had had this condition for many years. He also told me that he regularly took the aspirin prescribed for him by Dr. Yin. But he was reluctant to submit to a blood test. “Why don’t you just give me acupuncture from time to time?” he suggested.

I did give him acupuncture that day, but I did not feel that I really knew what I was doing since I did not understand what his problem was. I told Dr. Yin about my puzzlement, and he simply said that acupuncture should be good for the instructor.

The next day, Instructor Zhang came to our platoon and told me in front of everyone how much better he felt after the acupuncture. When he left, Li Baoquan said that the political instructor should thank him because he had acted as my acupuncture guinea pig.

Soon after, we received an order from the regiment that everyone should be tested to find out their blood type as part of our preparations for war, in case there was a need for a blood transfusion. For two days we were busy drawing blood samples. I made sure to take a little extra from the instructor because I wanted to see how bad his arthritis was.

I tested his blood twice. Both times, the result turned out negative. The test for arthritis was the simplest of all tests, and there was no way I could have made a mistake. That turtle egg (a term of endearment similar to “son of a bitch”) did not have arthritis at all. He was just inventing a reason not to go to the fields. That pot-bellied lazy pig. Hypocrite. He was even worse than the company commander, who did not pretend to need an excuse not to work. I felt stupid for having spent so much time thinking about how to treat him.

I went to tell Dr. Yin what I had found. He said indifferently that he had told me the instructor was in excellent health. No wonder he was not interested. He had known this all along.

I told some friends the story about the political instructor. Everybody agreed that the instructor was the biggest turtle egg under heaven. But all of them advised me to keep quiet about it.

“The Monkey King could not somersault out of the Buddha’s palm,” Li Baoquan said. “Instructor Zhang could make your life miserable if you offend him. If he wants you to treat him again, just plant your needles on all the wrong points and let that turtle egg have a good time.” Fortunately, the instructor did not ask me for acupuncture again. I thought that either Dr. Yin had told him what I had found or he thought he had already achieved his purpose by letting everyone know that I had treated his arthritis. For weeks, I thought all the time about what I should say if he came back. I could not stop thinking about what a turtle egg he was.

The clinic was always busy between work and curfew times, especially after dinner. Some complaints varied with season and weather, but most remained constant throughout the year. The most frequent problems included stomachache, dysentery, back pain, arthritis, frostbite, heatstroke, heartburn, head colds, and minor gynecological problems such as cramps.

It was simple enough to treat most of these common issues, but it was difficult to eliminate the causes. Stomachache and dysentery were caused by bad food and unclean water—all our water was contaminated by dirt as well as human and animal waste. The kitchen usually boiled its water first, but when we were working in the fields we often had no choice but to drink from ditches. In summer, stomach problems were routine.

We sometimes tried to use traditional Chinese medicine to prevent diseases. We put alum into the water to make the mud sink to the bottom. In summer, I would collect the stems of eggplants, dry them in the sun, and store them for use in winter. The liquid from boiled eggplant stems was effective for frostbite. But most diseases were caused by poor living conditions and hard labor, which could not be prevented.

Occasionally, there were more severe cases of illness. The first really sick patient I treated was Cui Xianchao. He came down with a high fever and was vomiting constantly. At first, I thought it was just a common cold and gave him some aspirin and other drugs to relieve his symptoms. Overnight, his case worsened. He coughed so hard that he could not sleep—and neither could the people who shared his room.

Soon Cui became severely dehydrated, and Dr. Yin ordered that he be given an intravenous transfusion of normal saline and penicillin injections. I also gave him injections of metamizole sodium, known as analgene, to relieve his fever and pain. Because he needed full-time attention, I was excused from going to the fields. I nursed him as he lay there panting. I read him books out loud and, when he was up to it, we would discuss the contents.

No sooner had Cui Xianchao recovered than Liu Xiaotong became sick. He had such a severe toothache that he could not eat or sleep. His left cheek was so swollen that his face was distorted. His gums bled. But there was nothing we could do other than give him antibiotics. He urgently needed to see a dentist.

The nearest one was with the division hospital in Urat Qianqi. With Dr. Yin’s help, I secured the permission of the political instructor to take him there. But the truck that brought our food from Urat Qianqi every two weeks would not arrive for a week, and the company leaders did not think that an illness as insignificant as a toothache was worth dispatching a special truck. So poor Xiaotong had to wait.

While we were waiting, Xiaotong was absolutely miserable. He moaned constantly, both hands over his swollen face. To relieve his pain and give him a few hours of sleep, I gave him injections of dolantin, the strongest analgesic we had. But after a few days, I had to stop because I was afraid he might become addicted.

It seemed there had to be something else I could do to relieve the pain, and I consulted some traditional Chinese medicine books. In one of them, I found a remedy for toothache in the form of the poisonous yellow liquid a toad squirts from its warts when threatened. Since the liquid was poisonous, the book warned, it had to be used sparingly and carefully.

Xiaotong, desperate, was quite willing to try the “toad treatment.” So I went out and captured a large grotesque-looking toad and put him in a washbasin. I gently touched his back with a cotton swab. I could see he was unhappy: his belly started to grow. I applied a little more pressure, palpating the warts. Suddenly, yellowish liquid squirted out. The force of it was such that some of the goo landed on my hand. I immediately swabbed up the rest. Xiaotong, standing by, opened his mouth and allowed me to spread the “medicine” along his gums.

After a bit, he announced that his gums were numb. The medicine worked. Encouraged, I collected more yellow ooze in the same way. Unfortunately, the toad became uncooperative after a while. There was no way that I could preserve this “toad product,” and Xiaotong’s numbness lasted only a short while. After several days of this unorthodox treatment, Xiaotong and I gave up, concluding that Western medicine was more convenient, and did not taste nearly as bad.

One day, Dr. Yin asked me to give an intramuscular injection to a young woman of the Fifth Platoon. She had been in bed for several days. Dr. Yin could not find anything wrong with her and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. But when the pain attacked, she rolled around, sometimes falling onto the floor if no one caught her. Several people had to hold her down for the injection of pain reliever.

This went on for several days, and I became uneasy about the therapy. I suspected that her pain was probably more psychological than physical, and that the injections were probably more effective on her mental state than anything else. I decided to try something different.

I took a syringe filled with saline and a little harmless vitamin B12 and went to her dormitory. The liquid vitamin B12 was an unusual pink. I told her we had just got hold of some imported medicine that was exactly right for her. I asked her to steel herself, because this special medicine would be painful when injected. She grew tense and made an excuse to avoid the treatment. But I insisted, telling her this would take care of her condition. The placebo effect worked. This was the last we heard of her pain. She was cured once and for all.

As Construction Army Corps soldiers, we were privileged to receive free medical care. We barefoot doctors were poorly trained, but at least we could provide basic care and administer some medications. If the problem was beyond our skill, we could send the patient to a hospital. But for the local peasants, medicine was a luxury. They had to pay if they came to our clinics, for they were not part of the same administrative system. Many of them had never been to a doctor in their entire lives.

One day, when Dr. Yin happened to be away, I was on duty when a local peasant mother in her thirties came in with a three-year-old boy in her arms. The little boy’s face was red, his lips were blistered, and his eyes were tightly closed. He was hot to the touch and had a high fever. The woman was crying. I could tell at a glance that the boy was at risk of dying. His mother said he had been having convulsions.

Normally we would send a seriously ill patient to the division hospital in Urat Qianqi. But I was afraid that the child would not survive a bumpy journey in a tractor or truck, even if we could find such a vehicle. I decided I had to treat him myself.

As I examined the boy, I was filled with fear, knowing he could die at any moment, literally in my hands. But I did not have time to be afraid. I listened to his lungs and could hear the moist rale and shallow respiration through the stethoscope. His pulse was weak and rapid. I concluded that he was suffering from lobar pneumonia.

The most urgent thing was to bring down the fever and stop the convulsions. I also had to apply antibiotics to stop the respiratory infection. I sent someone to fetch Gao Xiaorong, my fellow barefoot doctor, and set to work.

The clinic had only two little rooms, one of which served as a pharmacy and the other as a treatment room. There was nowhere I could ask the mother to go, so I let her stay in the room. Between sobs, she told me she had not come earlier because she had no money to pay for a doctor.

Gao Xiaorong came rushing in. She had become a barefoot doctor two years earlier than I and was more experienced. She agreed with my diagnosis and plan, and we set to work.

A test of the boy’s leucocyte count, a type of infection-fighting white blood cell, confirmed my diagnosis. We gave him an injection of analgene to bring down the fever. Gao gave him a skin test to determine if he was allergic to penicillin and streptomycin. We were both holding our breath because if he were, we would be out of options. But he was negative, and we gave him a large injection of a combination of both antibiotics. Then we put him on intravenous transfusions of both normal saline and glucose. Throughout this process, the boy did not utter a single cry. I became more and more scared. What if our treatment failed? We had no backup plan. He could die if this did not work.

Now we had to wait for results. The mother had been sad when she first came in, but now she looked frightened. I allowed her to come and sit by her child, but seeing all the tubes, she dared not touch him. I felt pretty desperate, too. All I could think was, “Please don’t die.”

Gao Xiaorong and I took turns bathing the boy’s body with alcohol-soaked cotton to help bring down the temperature. While I was not doing anything, I held his hand as if to inject energy from my body into his.

To our delight, the boy’s temperature started to subside shortly before dinner and the convulsions stopped. The mother stopped sobbing. By bedtime, his breathing and pulse had become less rapid and slowly normalized. We gave him more antibiotics. At nightfall, the mother was calm enough to go back to her village to report the news to her family.

I stayed with the boy throughout the night and added to the transfusion bottle several times. Shortly after dawn, Gao came and told me to get some sleep. I was so tired that I fell asleep despite the noise of the day. It was midmorning when I woke up again.

I could hear people talking before I reached clinic door. I rushed inside to find the boy awake, his big head leaning weakly against the pillow. His mother was showing him a homemade toy. I knew he was out of danger.

The fever came back that afternoon, but only briefly. The antibiotics proved to be effective on this child who had never been exposed to any medication before.

It turned out that his father was a horse-cart driver who was away on some business. I could imagine how devastating it would have been if the boy had died in his absence. I felt grateful that the child had lived, although I was not sure to whom I should be grateful.

The mother wanted to bring the boy home, fearing a longer stay would be too expensive. But I could not let this boy go yet. After consulting with Gao, we told the mother the treatment would be free. I told her to bring the boy back whenever he got sick and there would be no charge. Nobody would know if we had used the medicine on an Army Corps soldier or on somebody else.

The boy was shy and would not talk to anyone but his mother. But he had a rapid recovery and by the third day did not want to stay in bed. When he went home a few days later, he was a healthy little boy, if a bit weak.

At that time, the newspapers were reporting miraculous “newly emerging things” as a result of applying “invincible Mao Zedong Thought.” In medicine in particular, there were many such stories. A People’s Liberation Army medical unit used acupuncture to cure the mute and the deaf, for example. The newspapers said that the first words these formerly mute people spoke were, “Long live Chairman Mao.” There were reports of discoveries of new acupuncture points to cure all types of diseases. Even the official Manual for Barefoot Doctors had a special section on “new acupuncture therapies.”

Naturally, I read about these developments with keen interest, although I remained skeptical. For curing the mute and the deaf, for example, the newspapers reported that the doctors applied acupuncture needles to points behind the neck, which traditional practice specifically warned against as extremely dangerous. But there were other new therapies that seemed less dangerous. One of them was “rooster blood therapy,” which became popular among people who had chronic diseases. The therapy involved drawing blood from a rooster and injecting it into humans. One of our neighbors in Beijing had bought a large rooster for that purpose. But the neighbors complained about his crowing, so the old lady had to make a muzzle for the poor cock.

Although I was skeptical of such discoveries, I was curious, too. One day Gao Xiaorong told me that Zhang Fengmei, the company bookkeeper and a good friend of hers, had learned of a new therapy that she wanted to try.

Zhang Fengmei was a reasonably good-looking woman from Tianjin. She had a mild case of acne that embarrassed her greatly. Others would not have admitted that this bothered them, because concern about appearance was regarded as bourgeois. But she was close with Gao and had asked her to find a cure. Gao had mentioned it to me, but all I could find in books was a recommendation to eat less fat and more fruits and vegetables. Of course, in the Gobi there was hardly any fat in our diet and we almost never saw fruit.

The new treatment that Zhang Fengmei had read about was “self-blood therapy.” It involved having about five cc’s of blood drawn from one’s own veins and immediately injecting it into one’s posterior. I had no idea what the scientific basis for this was, but Zhang was quite determined to try it. Gao knew that I liked to try new things and asked me to help.

Gao and Zhang were very careful to keep the operation a secret. I appreciated their trust and the fact that they had involved me in this conspiracy, and I was eager to find out if this was indeed a miracle cure, since many others in the company also had acne. When we were ready, Gao explained the procedure to Zhang and told her not to be bashful because she would have to pull her pants down as soon as we drew the blood from her arm.

I was nervous and excited. I also felt funny about the “logic” behind this. I just could not figure out what the difference was between having the blood in one’s veins and in one’s posterior muscles. Would it stimulate some kind of immune reaction? Anyhow, there was no harm trying, or so I thought.

Zhang was very cooperative and the procedure was completed in about three minutes. In the days following, we repeated the same treatment several times. For the next few weeks, I would stare at Zhang’s face whenever I saw her to see if her problem was cured. To my disappointment, there did not seem to be any difference. Discouraged, Zhang gave up. But I have had my eyes open for a cure for acne ever since, and I still haven’t found a truly effective therapy in spite of many claims.

Some people who had been diagnosed as chronically sick had received permission to return to their home cities. Such permission had to be issued by the division hospital, where there were trained doctors and testing facilities. But there were many ways to fool a doctor. For example, one could go home if one had tuberculosis, and people devised a way to fool the X-ray machine: They put tincture of iodine on a piece of adhesive plaster and put it on their backs; iodine absorbs X-rays and leaves a shadow resembling tuberculosis. It was only after this method became common knowledge that a stop was put to it. All X-rays had to be taken from several angles to make sure the “TB” had not been taped on.

The most dramatic success in obtaining a permanent return home due to illness permit was achieved by a boy named Wang Kang.

One day, one of his roommates asked Dr. Yin to come check Wang Kang’s leg, which had stopped moving completely. Dr. Yin checked the involuntary responses and found everything normal. But Wang said that he no longer felt that his leg existed. Dr. Yin thought it might be another case of hysteria and decided to try the same trick I had used with the girl from the Fifth Platoon. But still the boy’s leg would not move. After two weeks of this, there was clear muscular atrophy: his leg had visibly shrunk. Puzzled and concerned, Dr. Yin sent him to the division hospital.

The doctors there could not find anything wrong either, but they hospitalized Wang for further observation. The next day the doctors found that his bed had been moved from next to the door to a more comfortable place by the wall. Wang claimed he did not know how the bed had moved. He said that he had woken up to find it in its new position. The doctors had no evidence to prove anything else. And there was no question that his left leg was much smaller than his right one now.

Wang stayed in the division hospital for a whole month, where he limped around on a pair of crutches. His case had all the doctors puzzled. Finally, they concluded that he had better seek help in his hometown, Tianjin, and issued him permanent home leave. He came back to the company to collect his belongings.

On the day of his departure, many of us went out to see him off. He was comfortably seated in the driver’s cabin of the truck. There were handshakes and farewell exchanges. Finally, when the truck pulled off, Wang threw his crutches out the window. “Enough of this!” he shouted. Only then did we realize that he had been feigning it all along. You have to admire him for his discipline and the extraordinary suffering he had to go through to pull this off.

I had not been sleeping well since coming back from the medical training course. I was suffering from neurasthenia, I believed, and my major symptom was insomnia. Despite my exhaustion, I continued to go to work without taking time off. I wanted to contribute enough to be worth the few wotou I ate every day. Moreover, I wanted to be with the people of the platoon, so nobody would think that I was any different now that I was a barefoot doctor.

I sought a remedy for my problem. I read in some medical books that neurasthenia generally occurred after tension caused by higher nervous system activity when mental activity reached a state of exhaustion. There was no question that I had been studying hard, and I had always liked to read. But I strongly believed that the real cause of the problem was malnutrition.

The package of food my father had sent me was long exhausted. I began to spend all my monthly wages, five yuan, on food. When the shelves in the small shop were empty, I would go with friends like Cui Xianchao and Liu Xiaotong to a village quite far away to buy a chicken or two. When we pooled our wages, we could get a couple of chickens at a time. We always shared everything among whoever came into the room when the chicken was being cooked. So one person could only have a few bites of chicken meat once in a long while. But our meager monthly pay was only enough to buy one chicken apiece and there was not much I could do to improve my nutrition intake.

Then I learned that vitamin B complex was supposed to nourish the nervous system and to improve my sleep. For some reason, our clinic was stocked with injectable vials of vitamin B complex. I started to give myself an injection of vitamin B complex every day. It was an awkward exercise, putting a needle into my own behind. It was painful to begin with, and it was even worse when I was pushing the liquid into the muscle. But the practice of doing self-injection at my medical training now proved useful. I don’t know if this had an actual or psychological effect, but I began to sleep better after several shots.

I stole a rooster once, but not for the meat. Since I didn’t sleep well, I woke up at the slightest noise. For a long while, a rooster’s crowing awakened me before the sun rose. It was so annoying and painful. I decided to act. One night, I caught the rooster in his coop while he was asleep and I twisted off his head with my bare hands. I had to walk a long way to dump the body in a ditch. I knew there was no other way to silence him, so I had to murder him, as he literally was driving me to the edge of sanity.

I doubt that a farmer laborer has sleep problems, as the day’s hard work tires him out and drains his energy, inducing him to sleep. But a combination of hard labor, not enough to eat, and intensive reading whenever possible would fray your nerves, no matter how physically exhausted you are.

I eventually recovered from my frequent insomnia, once I was able to get enough nutrition in my diet years later. But to this day, I don’t sleep well, a reminder of my days in the Gobi.

One of the tasks of being a medic was to administer vaccines to protect against epidemics. The first one I helped with nearly got the entire company killed.

It was a vaccine against the bubonic plague—in sparsely populated Inner Mongolia, there were field rats. Plague was endemic in this area of China during my time in the Gobi. The last time the Fifth Company had been vaccinated had been shortly before we arrived about two years earlier. There was thus the need to vaccinate those of us who came after.

Dr. Yin was away from the camp so all three of us medics were involved. The vaccine came in powder form. Wang Xinquan, Gao Xiaorong, and I diluted it with normal saline according to the instructions given to us by the regiment hospital. It took an entire day to vaccinate the whole company. Li Baoquan had avoided it the last time, and I was jeering at him for being so chicken-hearted as to be afraid of a small shot in the arm. But he replied that if everyone became immune to the plague, there would be no way for him to get the terrible disease either.

I would not listen to this nonsense. Since I was closer to Baoquan than anyone else, I got Yan Chongjie and two others to help me hold him down. We vaccinated him by force, as if he were a pig. Baoquan was strange. He didn’t mind being used as a guinea pig for me to practice acupuncture, but he would not submit to a shot that was supposed to be good for him.

The next day was a day off because of the expected side effects from the vaccination.

There were side effects—but they were entirely unexpected. Overnight the arm in which I took the shot became red and swollen. I thought it was normal. But by afternoon I felt all the symptoms of a bad case of influenza. Everyone else was faring the same. We were all in bed. Few of us wanted to eat that evening.

The second day was awful. My whole body alternately burned and felt very cold. I knew I was running a fever. I had never expected a vaccine would have such severe effects. Could I be allergic?

I was not alone, though. No one who had been vaccinated could get up. I checked all our temperatures to discover we all had fevers. Baoquan was complaining that I had brought him suffering. I had a splitting headache and could hardly keep my eyes open. I felt so weak that it took great effort just to go to the outhouse and back.

I knew something was wrong. I staggered to my feet and went around the camp. I checked several rooms and other platoons and found the same situation everywhere. As I was going around, I felt as if I were walking on a cloud. The veins in my forehead were pounding so loudly and rapidly that I thought my head would explode.

I finally found my way to the clinic. Gao Xiaorong was on duty. She did not take the vaccine because she had done it before. I told her I was afraid that the high fever was damaging my brain and asked her to give me an injection. After some discussion, we decided to give pain and fever relief medicine to anyone who needed it.

It occurred to me to check the vaccine. No vaccine should have had such a powerful effect. I looked at the label of the vaccine bottle and at the instruction sheet that came from the regiment hospital. What I saw made me tremble with fear. The instructions from the regiment said that each bottle should be diluted to use for two adults. The tiny print instructions on the label said that each bottle should be used for 20 adults. Each of us had been given 10 times the normal dose. We were exhibiting the exact symptoms of bubonic plague. I had no idea if we would survive our self-inflicted epidemic.

I showed my discovery to Gao Xiaorong and staggered back to my platoon with a medical kit. I knew that there was nothing I could do but wait and hope that the effects of the vaccine would pass. But I gave medicine to everyone just to relieve the fever and pain a bit. I trembled as I did my job. Then I went back to my room, climbed onto the kang, and collapsed.

Gao Xiaorong made an emergency call to the regiment hospital. The company leadership alerted headquarters that there had been a “medical accident.” A rescue team headed by Dr. Yu arrived the same day.

They stayed until everyone was fully recovered a few days later. It was fortunate that there was no permanent damage to anyone. Later, I heard that we were not alone. The doctor who wrote the instructions for us sent them to several companies. If he had missed by another decimal point, he would have wiped out maybe hundreds of us with one stroke of his pen.

It gave me great pleasure to serve as a barefoot doctor, although it meant much more work for me. I liked interacting with people and I enjoyed bringing them back to health. I was learning a great deal. But in spite of my hard work, I knew the political instructor and the company commander had begun to dislike me more and more. The instructor’s attitude toward me changed drastically after I found out that he did not really have arthritis. Soon, I offended Commander Zhang as well.

The commander often came to the clinic for cough pills. One day Gao Xiaorong told me the commander didn’t have a coughing problem; he wanted those cough pills because they were sugarcoated. He would put the tablet in his mouth, suck the sugar off, and spit out the rest.

I didn’t like what I had heard. Didn’t he know that medicines were expensive and that local peasants didn’t have easy access to them? How could he waste cough pills like that?

Then one day he came in when I was on duty and asked me for some pills. I told him that he had to get a prescription from Dr. Yin before I could give them to him. His face grew redder than usual, and he said coldly and menacingly, “Why do we need you if you can’t even give us some medicine?” Then he stalked out.

I feared then that my days as a barefoot doctor were numbered. A few weeks later, I was unceremoniously booted out of the clinic: I was told I would not need to come to the clinic anymore. There was never any announcement. A new full-time medic was appointed to take my place. And I resumed my full-time duties in the fields with the comrades of my squad. My medical career was over.
