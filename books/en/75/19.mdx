title: 19 Roads to Rome
---







In July 1977, Deng Xiaoping was once again brought back into the Party’s leadership, under China’s new leader, Hua Guofeng. Initially Deng’s agenda included only the military, foreign affairs, and education. He moved swiftly and restored the college entrance examination system, which had been suspended since 1966.

There were more than 10 million applications for the college entrance exams that year, and 5.7 million people eventually took part. Of those, only 272,297 students were accepted, a rate of less than 5 percent. The new students ranged in age from 13 to 37, which reflected the gap in schooling created by the 10-year Cultural Revolution.

The Construction Army Corps system was dismantled. The “educated youth” who had been sent down to the countryside gradually returned to the cities, including my friends from the Gobi. But it was hard for them to find a decent job; their lack of formal education left them severely underqualified. Many of my friends struggled to find their footing once they returned.

With the leadership’s most radical elements purged following Mao’s death, changes could be felt throughout the country, but slowly, because Hua Guofeng favored a policy that adhered to whatever Mao had said and done. His legitimacy and power came from Mao, who had designated him as his successor; it was not surprising he remained loyal to Mao and whatever Mao represented. The rest of the new leadership, particularly a faction of pre–Cultural Revolution senior leaders led by Deng Xiaoping, held opposing views. They did not renounce Mao, but they were willing to publicly question his policies. All their experiences and suffering during Mao’s political campaigns had taught them that the only test of the truth was not what Mao had said but what worked or did not work in practice. The reality was that many of Mao’s policies had been complete failures, disastrous and ruinous for the nation as well as for its people.

In December 1978, after what amounted to a well-publicized debate over Mao’s legacy, Deng became the de facto leader of the country. Hua Guofeng, who had resisted changes to Mao’s policies, was gradually sidelined, although he is remembered for changing the course of history as the leader of the coup d’état against Mao’s wife and her gang of radicals. Deng was free to move ahead with a new policy focused on reform and openness. He knew that to develop, China had to depart from the Soviet-style centrally planned economy and move in the direction of a market-based economy. It also had to abandon its isolationist stance and form better relations with the West.

Jimmy Carter won the election to become president of the United States in 1976. On New Year’s Day 1979, China and the United States formally established diplomatic relations. At the end of January 1979, Deng Xiaoping paid an official visit to the United States at the invitation of President Carter, the first Chinese leader to do so since the founding of the PRC in 1949. His visit also provided the Chinese public, for the first time, with an opportunity to get glimpses of the United States, as television cameras followed Deng everywhere while he was there.

Shortly after Deng’s return from the states, China launched a border war against Vietnam, purportedly to punish it for its invasion of Cambodia and for its incursions into what China considered its own territory. The war captured the public’s attention until it was concluded about one month later. The United States had untangled itself from the Vietnam War in 1975. China and the United States, former enemies, were now becoming friends. China and North Vietnam, former allies, now turned their guns on each other. It is really true that in international relations, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies, only permanent interests.

Part of Deng’s education reform was to resume the examination system and to reward academic performance. Before winter break of 1977, we were given final exams, for the first time. The school authorities decided to post all the grades and, more boldly, to reassign classes based on the grades from the finals. Two “fast-pace” classes were formed to include the best students from the 10 classrooms. I was put into one of them. From the next semester on, I would have new classmates. The objective of the new system was to “produce talents faster.”

I was assigned to Classroom No. Four, and I was elected the class representative. The new students selected through the nationwide college entrance examination in the last two months of 1977 had begun their matriculation in late February 1978 as well. But we had little interaction with the students outside our own cohort.

The fast pace did make a difference. My new classmates were the best and brightest in their former classrooms. They were competitive, motivated, and always hungry for more from the teachers. We began to study English literature as well as business writing in English. My favorite authors were Mark Twain, for his great sense of humor; Ernest Hemingway, for his simple and short sentences, which were great for a foreign student of English; and Jack London, for the human struggles in his stories and his characters, some of whom I identified with. I also enjoyed the French author Guy de Maupassant, whose short stories, translated into English, were full of surprises, irony, and satire. I loved his short stories so much I translated some from English into Chinese.

By now, I was making good progress with my spoken English, which I practiced with my classmates and with the foreign teachers who came to China for a semester or two. Beyond listening comprehension and speaking, we also spent much time studying English grammar. The basics were not difficult to learn because the typical sentence structure in English is similar to Chinese, with the subject preceding the verb and the verb before the object. The difficult parts of the English language were the tenses, the moods, such as the subjunctive mood, and especially the articles. It did not seem that there were fixed rules on how to use an article. The teachers told us that as we read more and more English writing we would develop a feel for using that part of speech.

I decided that the best way to learn to speak fluently was to memorize English texts by listening to language tapes repeatedly, and by reciting them back loudly and often. I began to memorize and recite every passage, short story, or essay in our textbook from the beginning of the semester. Once I had committed the different expressions to memory, they came to me easily when I spoke the language. Every day, I would find a block of time to walk around campus, reciting all the passages in our textbook from the beginning to wherever it was we had got at that point. By the end of the semester, I could recite the entire textbook from beginning to end. In order to teach myself the subjunctive mood, for example, I memorized such passages as: “Whatever happened to her then may have determined whatever happened to her afterwards, and whatever happened to her afterwards may have driven her to suicide, a chain of events,” from the English play An Inspector Calls.

I wasn’t the only one doing this. Walking around the campus after dinnertime, I frequently passed classmates who were loudly reading or talking to themselves in English, French, German, Polish, Japanese, or Arabic, oblivious to their surroundings and others around them. There was one student in a senior class, by the name of Tang. He not only talked to himself all the time, he would come up to anyone to chat nonstop in English, regardless of whether or not his audience was interested. One of his classmates was so annoyed by him that he yelled, “I will slap your face if you don’t stop talking to me.”

The institute now had a reading room stocked with foreign newspapers and magazines. There were issues of the Times of London, Reader’s Digest, and the British Daily Mirror, whose naked “page 3” girls I found too scandalous to look at, yet too tantalizing to resist.

The English publications were typically outdated, but I didn’t care. I was not there to keep up with the news, which I got by listening to VOA and the BBC every day. I was there to learn the language and foreign culture.

Reader’s Digest was one of my favorites. It ran a condensed version of the novel A Town Like Alice, which I found mesmerizing. I particularly loved the regular feature Laughter: The Best Medicine. I remember a favorite joke of mine from that feature: “Men marry women hoping they will never change; women marry men hoping they will change. Both are disappointed.”

For the first time since before the Cultural Revolution, bookstores began to sell Chinese translations of foreign books. I bought two plays by Shakespeare translated into Chinese. I found them difficult, even in Chinese.

On January 10, 1979, our class graduated, three years and three months to the day after we matriculated on October 10, 1975. In keeping with the system at that time, everyone was assigned a job. None of us had a choice. Those assigned a job in Beijing were considered lucky, both for the living conditions and because Beijing was where the action was. It was the capital, and news traveled here first.

I stayed at BIFT and joined the English Department. Along with a few classmates who were also chosen, I would receive further training, for at least another year, in a faculty training program while serving as a faculty member.

I was given a salary of 49 yuan per month, a bit less than $32 at the official exchange rate, and just about $16 at the black market rate. Still, it was a big step up from the 15 yuan per month student stipend I was receiving previously.

Although I did not realize it at the time, Deng’s nine-day visit to the United States at the invitation of Jimmy Carter in 1979 would have an immense effect on my life. It not only paved the way for China to open its door to visiting foreigners, but also allowed Chinese to go abroad to study.

Deng, himself a work-study student in France in the 1920s, had already had the idea of sending Chinese students and scholars abroad to study before he left for the United States. In Washington, Jimmy Carter broached the subject of Chinese emigration with Deng. Under a piece of legislation known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, the United States was not allowed to grant most-favored-nation trading status (which was important for facilitating China’s trade with the US) to any country that restricted emigration. This law was primarily aimed at Soviet-bloc countries, which had restricted travel for Jewish refugees and other religious minorities, but it affected China, a closed country, as well. It was a significant obstacle for increased trade between the two countries. According to Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter’s National Security Advisor, after Carter brought up the subject, Deng leaned forward and said, “Fine. We’ll let them go. Are you prepared to accept 10 million?” Everyone laughed, as President Carter later recalled, although somewhat uneasily. It was said that Carter quickly dropped the subject.

The Americans thought Deng was joking. It would turn out that he was quite serious. His visit heralded China’s opening, including allowing overseas studies and emigration, an opening that started with a trickle but became a torrent. Soon so many were knocking on US doors that the limiting factor became the difficulty of getting a US visa.

We continued our studies with more advanced materials. Every week, we took classes in reading, writing, listening comprehension, and speaking, and every week there were tests and exams, which pressured us to study ever harder.

In late January 1977, while I was on winter break from school, I met a girl in the office of a mutual friend by chance. I had walked in to deliver a package from my mother to this friend only to find her chatting animatedly with another girl in a navy blue uniform. She was introduced to me as Shi Bin, a native of Beijing but now on a school break from a university in Harbin, in China’s far northeast. Bin was pretty, with big eyes and dark hair, and tall at 1.74 meters (∼5 feet 8 inches). It turned out that she played professional basketball for the women’s team of the navy. I was impressed by her personality—open, unreserved, confident, straightforward, and no-nonsense. I thought, “what a happy girl,” very different from many of the girls I had met who looked to have suffered too much in life and wore their miseries on their faces.

I would learn later that Bin had suffered more than most in the most unimaginable way. Just the previous year, while away at school, the massive earthquake struck her home city, Tangshan, and her father and two younger sisters were killed when the family home collapsed; her mother was severely injured.

But none of the pain of that tremendous loss was visible on her sunlit face.

Bin and I left the office of our friend together. She was headed in the same direction as my home so I offered to walk with her.

“Okay. But do you know the way?” she asked.

“Of course,” I replied. I was confident in my sense of direction. Even in the Gobi, surrounded by miles of emptiness, I had little trouble finding my way.

“Don’t worry,” I added nonchalantly, “all roads lead to Rome.” Beijing’s roads were generally laid out in a grid running north-south or east-west, and this pattern persisted even in the small and narrow lanes, or hutong, in residential neighborhoods. So, as long as we walked in the right direction, I was sure we would get to our destination.

As we walked we chatted with each other. I must have been too enamored and lost in conversation to notice where we were headed. We promptly came to a dead-end in a hutong.

“I thought you said all roads lead to Rome?” she prodded me, looking amused.

“Most of these hutong go straight through.” I tried to hide my embarrassment, but in vain. “I suppose this is one of the rare exceptions.”

Bin had a good laugh as we found our way back out. Her laughter relaxed me. Unconsciously, my use of the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” foreshadowed the inevitability of our relationship.

An opportunity came. In April 1979, I noticed an advertisement for a position at the United Nations in the newspaper. At that time, advertising in newspapers was almost unheard of in China, so the UN ad was particularly prominent, and it immediately caught my attention. It said that the UN would be recruiting simultaneous interpreters from China for the first time. The recruits would be put through a yearlong intensive training program established at the First Foreign Language Institute in Beijing. After the training program, the recruits would be posted to United Nations headquarters in New York City.

A group of us young faculty members from BIFT applied even though none of us had any great hope of being selected. The program was to test and interview candidates from three major cities in China—Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou—and would accept only 25 people in total. Who would want to miss a golden opportunity to go to the United States and to work at the UN? We were sure China’s best and brightest would come out, and the competition would be too difficult for us to have any chances.

Still, I thought there was no harm trying, and it would be a good exercise anyhow. In late April, I sat for the UN exam and did well enough to advance to the next round. I was relaxed when I took that second round of exams, as I had no expectation to be selected from among so many. Although the tests were rigorous and the subjects quite wide-ranging, I did not feel they were particularly hard. I was quite pleased, and somewhat surprised, when I received notice that I had made it into the third round. This thing suddenly looked quite real. If I did get selected, it would change my life. I had never expected to work abroad, and for the United Nations, no less. Now my hopes were up.

The third round was not so much a test as a face-to-face interview with the UN recruiters, representatives from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and professors from Beijing First Language Institute. It was held at the Beijing International Club, a building next to Beijing’s diplomatic district. The finalists waited in line to be ushered into the interview room. When it was almost my turn, I suddenly became nervous as hell. I was fully conscious that this would be the chance of a lifetime, for so much was at stake. Afraid to say something wrong, I seized up.

I walked into a big room to see more than a dozen examiners sitting in a semicircle. Some of them were foreigners and others were Chinese. The examiners looked friendly, but that did not ease my extreme nervousness. I was seated in a chair in the center facing the interviewers. Then they took turns asking me questions. I answered them mechanically. I was so nervous that I literally didn’t know what I was talking about.

The only question I still remember was: “What do you think about the Cultural Revolution?” By that time the Communist Party itself had concluded that the Cultural Revolution was “10 years of catastrophe” and it was no longer taboo to be openly critical of it. I wanted to say that by the end of the period, the economy was on the verge of being completely destroyed. In my nervousness, instead of using the passive tense—being destroyed—I said “on the verge of destroying.” I immediately realized my grammatical mistake but I still couldn’t bring the correct expression to mind. My heart sank. I thought I had blown the opportunity. I was quite disappointed with myself and regretted that I missed this opportunity so close at hand because I was not calm enough. I could not get over this nagging feeling of regret for a few days. But eventually I decided to put the whole matter out of my mind. It was July and the summer break began. I shifted my focus to find something interesting to do.

Toward the end of August, I returned to the BIFT campus to begin the autumn semester of faculty training. As I passed through the wrought-iron gate, someone working in the messenger’s office stepped out and stopped me. “Hey,” he said, “you had a letter from the First Foreign Language Institute.”

“Where’s the letter?” I asked. I knew it had to be about the UN program. I was surprised to hear from them again. “It sat here for some time and eventually we handed it over to the personnel department,” the man replied.

I hurried to the personnel department, but nobody could find it. Apparently, the letter was lost. I got on my bike and rode to the First Foreign Language Institute to find out what they wanted.

There, I met with Professor Zhang Zailiang, one of the instructors in charge of the UN program. He said there was good news and bad news. I did indeed do poorly during the interview, and I placed 33rd on the test, and did not make the cutoff to join the class of 25 students who would take the UN translator program that year. But I had done well enough to earn a spot in the second training program, which would begin in the winter of the following year.

Since I had completely given up hope and put the UN thing out of my mind, I was quite delighted by this news. Now it was just a matter of time until I could attend this program, which would prepare me to work as an interpreter at the UN headquarters in New York City.

I went to see Bin to share the news with her. As the weather was hot, we decided to go out to buy a watermelon to celebrate. As we were trying to pick a ripe melon from a stand on the street, I heard someone yelling, “Stop, thief!” A man dashed past, pursued by a group. Without thinking, I dropped the melon and joined the chase. But the thief ran like a rabbit and eventually got away.

When she finally caught up with me, Bin looked worried and said in a reproachful voice, “What were you doing?”

“Catching a thief,” I replied, matter-of-factly.

“What did he do? Steal a watermelon?” she asked.

I really had no idea what the offense was. He must have been guilty of something, as he was running away.

“That wasn’t worth it and so dangerous,” she said. “What if he had a knife? What if he turned around and stabbed you in your eye?”

“Then I would still be a one-eyed UN interpreter,” I teased her. From that day on, from time to time Bin would call me a one-eyed UN interpreter.

On Saturday, October 27, 1979, Bin and I went on our own to register to be married. There was a marriage license office in a village near the institute. I rode my bicycle with Bin seated behind me on the small baggage rack. The dirt road through the vegetable field was quite bumpy, and I pedaled slowly to make sure that I would not fall and drop my bride into the mud. The village was called Taiyanggong (Sun Temple). Until 50 years earlier, there had been a small temple where people would come to worship the sun god. The temple had long since disappeared, but the name remained. Now Taiyanggong was a farming village, producing vegetables for the city.

The office door was locked when we got there, and no one seemed to be around. We had to search out the person responsible for marriage registration. Finally, we found a middle-aged woman. I supposed it was rare for people outside the village to come here for marriage registration. She seemed a little annoyed to be disturbed.

“What are you here for?” she asked with a poker face, even though it was obvious. We explained that we’d like to register to get married. The woman gave a grumpy sigh, rolled her eyes, and sat down at the desk. It was plain that she didn’t see us as two young people trying to celebrate a happy occasion, but as a major inconvenience and a pile of paperwork.

“How long have you known each other?” she asked, looking at me. It was a standard question for the marriage form, but I was annoyed by her unpleasantness on such a happy occasion. “Three days,” I replied, curtly and innocently; the cynic in me was coming out. The woman stared at me, and then turned to Bin. “Do you really know this man?” she demanded. It took a while for my bride to convince her I was only joking.

We finally had our wedding ceremony on February 12, 1980. We just invited a few family members for dinner at my parents’ apartment. The guests included Bin’s mother, her only living immediate family member, and my parents, of course, as well as my sister and brother.

Although we were married, we did not have a place of our own to live. Your work unit assigned you to a home, and since there was a severe shortage at the time, newly married couples might wait years for one. We had to use a room in the apartment of my parents, or sometimes stay at Bin’s mother’s. Or we slept in my office—which I shared with others but had to myself at night—on a small mattress on top of two rows of chairs.

Bin wanted to have a new dress made after the wedding; I remember the dress she wanted was light green in color. The day she went to the tailor she had to get up at 4 a.m. and wait in line to take a number, and then wait again for her turn to have the appointment with the tailor. She asked me to go with her. I thought it was not worth it to get up so early for a dress, because I hadn’t yet learned about what members of the opposite sex considered important.

Later that morning, Bin came back from the tailor’s crying. She had waited for almost four hours in line, but when her turn came all the numbers were already drawn, and she left empty-handed. She was less angry at the tailor shop than with me for not having shared her pain by getting up early to go with her. In the end, she gave up the idea and never had a dress made. To this day, I still regret her disappointment and sadness, since I had played a role in it.

The faculty training program really helped improve our language proficiency. I began to teach English in the spring semester of 1980. My students were in their third year of studies, having been accepted after taking the nationwide standardized exams in 1978. They were an even better class than the cohort of 1977, when Deng restarted the examination system. They arrived already reading and speaking English. These students were bold, proactive, curious, and challenging. I quite enjoyed teaching them.

In the spring of 1980, a group of Americans arrived on campus. A San Francisco–based organization called the Asia Foundation came to recruit visiting scholars. The foundation received funding from public and private sources and provided support to programs to help developing countries in Asia. It was offering scholarships for three BIFT faculty members to study at US universities for a period of one year. This was the first time anyone at BIFT had had such an opportunity. All faculty members under the age of 45 were eligible and encouraged to apply, but the selection would be through a rigorous, comprehensive, and blind examination process, meaning that the test papers were identified by number and the examiners wouldn’t know who took the test.

I had already been accepted into the UN translator program on a deferred basis. But that program wouldn’t start until winter of the following year. The Asia Foundation visiting scholar program would start this autumn. The dean of the English Department, where I was teaching, encouraged me to apply. “You are going to America anyway so it doesn’t matter if you do well or poorly on the exams,” he told me. “You might as well give it a try.”

But this time, I was competing not only against my peers but also with many of my own professors. I didn’t think I could outcompete my professors, but since there was nothing to lose, I decided there was no harm in trying.

The tests were rigorous, covering a wide range of both English and Chinese languages, essays, and history. The blind nature of the tests allowed me to level the playing field somewhat in my own way. I knew that those who administered the tests would be biased in favor of those mid-aged scholars who had been educated before the Cultural Revolution, because the education quality had been much higher then. After all, this was a process of selecting visiting scholars to the United States. In my essays, I wrote in a style and a voice that would give the reader the impression I was one of those mid-aged scholars.

The result was announced: I came in first. I was surprised, but of course happily. Maybe my trick worked, but still I hadn’t expected to do better than my own professors, many of whom I knew were far better educated than me. I knew I was just more experienced than they were in taking tests. For the past three years, they had been busy giving exams without taking any themselves, whereas I had been busy taking them.

I was much happier with this result than with that of the UN exam because I didn’t disappoint myself this time. By then my father had returned from his African post. I hurried to my father’s office to tell him the good news, as I knew this would make him happy.

“Oh.” That was all he said, but I could tell he was pleased.

Suddenly, I had two opportunities to go to the United States. All roads were leading to Rome. All I had to do was pick one.

By the rules of that time, a graduate of the UN interpreter-training program would be deemed as having obtained a graduate degree. That was a big deal for me. I was still, like the rest of my cohort, a worker-peasant-soldier student, considered to be of lesser quality than those who were accepted into college through the formal entrance examination. Accordingly, my pay was less than that of college graduates before the Cultural Revolution. The UN job would pay tens of thousands of dollars per year, an astronomical sum compared to my 49 yuan a month teacher’s salary, or just $379 a year. At the time Bin was earning 56 yuan a month. To this day, she enjoys telling friends that I married her for her money.

Most important, the UN job would allow me to take my spouse with me to the States.

The Asia Foundation program, on the other hand, would only pay a stipend of about $250 per month. I could only stay in the United States for one year. And I could only go there alone, leaving my bride behind. But I would finally get a chance to study in a US university, which was something I had dreamed of doing. It was hard to say goodbye to a lot of money the UN job promised, not to mention my new wife.

Eventually, I chose the Asia Foundation. My friends at BIFT told me that I exchanged a watermelon for a sesame seed. In any case, the die was cast. On August 8, 1980, I received the formal notice to go to the United States as a visiting scholar.

The president of BIFT would decide which university I was going to attend. “There are three universities on the list provided by the American sponsor,” the president said, opening a letter written on finer, thicker paper than I had ever seen. “We can send one person to each. Since you did so well on the exam, you will go to the best one.”

I thanked him and waited anxiously to hear my destination.

“The first on the list is called Stanford.” The president paused. “Stanford. I’ve never heard of it. It must be an obscure school. You know there are thousands of universities in America.”

I nodded in agreement.

“Another is called the University of California at Berkeley. We have all heard about California. The University of California must be pretty good, but this one apparently is a branch school.”

At that time, because of the surging demand for higher education after the Cultural Revolution, several Chinese universities in Beijing had set up branch schools that accepted applicants who otherwise could not qualify for regular universities. A branch school to us meant second rate. I would not want to go there.

“The final one on the list is the University of San Francisco.” The president beamed. “San Francisco. I have heard so much about San Francisco. Have you heard of San Francisco?”

“Yes, certainly,” I replied. Who had not heard of San Francisco, the Old Gold Mountain, as it is known in Chinese?

“This one must be the best of the three.” He folded the letter. “You will go to the University of San Francisco.”

I smiled and thanked him profusely. I was so grateful and so excited.
