She came in that evening around quarter of twelve and said: “You should have been in bed an hour ago, Paul.”

He looked up, startled out of the story’s deep dream. Geoffrey—who had turned out to be very much the hero of this one—had just come face to face with the hideous queen bee, whom he would have to battle to the death for Misery’s life.

“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I’ll turn in after awhile. Sometimes you get it down or it gets away.” He shook his hand, which was sore and throbbing. A large hard growth, half callus and half blister, had risen on the inside of his index finger, where the pencil pressed most firmly. He had pills, and they would take away the pain, but they would also blur his thoughts.

“You think it’s good, don’t you?” she asked softly. “Really good. You’re not doing it just for me anymore, are you?”

“Oh no,” he said. For a moment he trembled on the edge of saying something more—of saying, It was never for you, Annie, or all the other people out there who sign their letters “Your number-one fan.” The minute you start to write all those people are at the other end of the galaxy, or something. It was never for my ex-wives, or my mother, or for my father. The reason authors almost always put a dedication on a book, Annie, is because their selfishness even horrifies themselves in the end.

But it would be unwise to say such a thing to her.

He wrote until dawn was coming up in the east and then fell into bed and slept for four hours. His dreams were confused and unpleasant. In one of them Annie’s father was climbing a long flight of stairs. He had a basket of what appeared to be newspaper clippings in his arms. Paul tried to cry out to him, to warn him, but every time he opened his mouth nothing came out but a neatly reasoned paragraph of narration—although this paragraph was different each time he tried to scream, it always opened the same way: “One day, about a week later . . .” And now came Annie Wilkes, screaming, rushing down the hall, hands outstretched to give her father the killing push . . . only her screams were becoming weird buzzing noises, and her body was rippling and humping and changing under her skirt and cardigan sweater, because Annie was changing into a bee.
