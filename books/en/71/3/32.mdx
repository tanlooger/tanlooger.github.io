For the next two days life went on just as it had before Duane Kushner; it was almost possible to believe Duane Kushner had never happened at all. Paul wrote almost constantly. He had given the typewriter up for the nonce. Annie put it on the mantel below the picture of the Arc de Triomphe without comment. He filled three legal pads in those two days. There was only one left. When he had filled that one, he would move on to the steno pads. She sharpened his half-dozen Berol Black Warrior pencils, he wrote them dull, and Annie sharpened them again. They shrank steadily as he sat in the sun by the window, bent over, sometimes scratching absently with the great toe of his right foot at the air where the sole of his left foot had been, looking through the hole in the paper. It had yawned wide open again, and the book rushed toward its climax the way the best ones did, as if on a rocket sled. He saw everything with perfect clarity—three groups all hellbent for Misery in the crenellated passages behind the idol’s forehead, two wanting to kill her, the third—consisting of Ian, Geoffrey, and Hezekiah—trying to save her . . . while below, the village of the Bourkas burned and the survivors massed at the one point of egress—the idol’s left ear—to massacre anyone who happened to stagger out alive.

This hypnotic state of absorption was rudely shaken but not broken when, on the third day after the visit of David and Goliath, a cream-colored Ford station wagon with KTKA/Grand Junction written on the side pulled into Annie’s driveway. The back was full of video equipment.

“Oh God!” Paul said, frozen somewhere between humor, amazement, and horror. “What’s this fuck-a-row?”

The wagon had barely stopped before one of the rear doors flew open and a guy dressed in combat-fatigue pants and a Deadhead tee-shirt leaped out. There was something big and black pistol-gripped in one hand and for one wild moment Paul thought it was a tear-gas gun. Then he raised it to his shoulder and swept it toward the house, and Paul saw it was a minicam. A pretty young woman was getting out of the front passenger seat, fluffing her blow-dried hair and pausing for one final appraising look at her makeup in the outside rear-view mirror before joining her camera-man.

The eye of the outside world, which had slipped away from the Dragon Lady these last few years, had now returned with a vengeance.

Paul rolled backward quickly, hoping he had been in time.

Well, if you want to know for sure, just check the six o’clock news, he thought, and then had to raise both hands to his mouth to plug up the giggles.

The screen door banged open and shut.

“Get the hell out of here!” Annie screamed. “Get the hell off my land!”

Dimly: “Ms. Wilkes, if we could have just a few—”

“You can have a couple of loads of double-ought buck up your cockadoodie bumhole if you don’t get out of here!”

“Ms. Wilkes, I’m Glenna Roberts from KTKA—”

“I don’t care if you’re John Q. Jesus Johnnycake Christ from the planet Mars! Get off my land or you’re DEAD!”

“But—”

KAPOW!

Oh Annie oh my Jesus Annie killed that stupid broad—

He rolled back and peeked through the window. He had no choice—he had to see. Relief gusted through him. Annie had fired into the air. That seemed to have done quite well. Glenna Roberts was diving head-first into the KTKA newsmobile. The camera-man swung his lens toward Annie; Annie swung her shotgun toward the camera-man; the camera-man, deciding he wanted to live to see the Grateful Dead again more than he wanted to roll tape on the Dragon Lady, immediately dropped into the back seat again. The wagon was reversing down the driveway before he got his door all the way closed.

Annie stood watching them go, the rifle held in one hand, and then she came slowly back into the house. He heard the clack as she put the rifle on the table. She came down to Paul’s room. She looked worse than he had ever seen her, her face haggard and pale, her eyes darting constantly.

“They’re back,” she whispered.

“Take it easy.”

“I knew all those brats would come back. And now they have.”

“They’re gone, Annie. You made them go.”

“They never go. Someone told them that cop was at the Dragon Lady’s house before he disappeared. So here they are.”

“Annie—”

“You know what they want?” she demanded.

“Of course. I’ve dealt with the press. They want the same two things they always want—for you to fuck up while the tape’s running and for someone else to buy the martinis when Happy Hour rolls around. But, Annie, you’ve got to settle d—”

“This is what they want,” she said, and raised one hooked hand to her forehead. She pulled down suddenly, sharply, opening four bloody furrows. Blood ran into her eyebrows, down her cheeks, along either side of her nose.

“Annie! Stop it!”

“And this!” She slapped herself across the left cheek with her left hand, hard enough to leave an imprint. “And this!” The right cheek, even harder, hard enough to make droplets of blood fly from the fingernail gouges.

“STOP it!” he screamed.

“It’s what they want!” she screamed back. She raised her hands to her forehead and pressed them against the wounds, blotting them. She held her bloody palms out toward him for a moment. Then she plodded out of the room.

After a long, long time, Paul began to write again. It went slowly at first—the image of Annie pulling those furrows into her skin kept intruding—and he thought it was going to be no good, he had just better pack it in for the day, when the story caught him and he fell through the hole in the paper again.

As always these days, he went with a sense of blessed relief.
