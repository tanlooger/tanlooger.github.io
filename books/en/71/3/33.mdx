More police came the next day: local yokels this time. With them was a skinny man carrying a case which could only contain a steno machine. Annie stood in the driveway with them, listening, her face expressionless. Then she led them into the kitchen.

Paul sat quietly, a steno pad of his own on his lap (he had finished the last legal pad the previous evening), and listened to Annie’s voice as she made a statement which consisted of all the things she had told David and Goliath four days ago. This, Paul thought, was nothing more than blatant harassment. He was amused and appalled to find himself feeling a little sorry for Annie Wilkes.

The Sidewinder cop who asked most of the questions began by telling Annie she could have a lawyer present if she wanted. Annie declined and simply re-told her story. Paul could detect no deviations.

They were in the kitchen for half an hour. Near the end one of them asked how she had come by the ugly-looking scratches on her forehead.

“I did it in the night,” she said. “I had a bad dream.”

“What was that?” the cop asked.

“I dreamed that people remembered me after all this time and started coming out here again,” Annie said.

When they were gone, Annie came to his room. Her face was doughy and distant and ill.

“This place is turning into Grand Central,” Paul said.

She didn’t smile. “How much longer?”

He hesitated, looked at the pile of typescript with the ragged stack of handwritten pages on top, then back at Annie. “Two days,” he said. “Maybe three.”

“The next time they come they’ll have the search warrant,” she said, and left before he could reply.
