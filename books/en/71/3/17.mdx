“Oh boy,” she said. “You must think Annie’s in a real poopie-doopie mood today. I wish you’d relax, Paul.” She put the hypo on the TV tray. “That’s scopolamine, which is a morphine-based drug. You’re lucky I have any morphine at all. I told you how closely they watch it in the hospital pharmacies. I’m leaving it because it’s damp down here and your legs may ache quite badly before I get back.

“Just a minute.” She gave him a wink which had strangely unsettling undertones—a wink one conspirator might give another. “You throw one cockadoodie ashtray and I’m as busy as a onearmed paperhanger. I’ll be right back.”

She went upstairs and came back shortly with the cushions from the sofa in the parlor and the blankets from his bed. She arranged the cushions behind him so he could sit up without too much discomfort—but he could feel the sullen chill of the rocks even through the cushions, waiting to steal out and freeze him.

There were three bottles of Pepsi on the collapsed TV tray. She opened two of them, using the opener on her keyring, and handed him one. She upended her own and drank half of it without stopping; then she stifled a burp, ladylike, against her hand.

“We have to talk,” she said. “Or, rather, I have to talk and you have to listen.”

“Annie, when I said you were crazy—”

“Hush! Not a word about that. Maybe we’ll talk about that later. Not that I would ever try to change your mind about anything you chose to think—a Mister Smart Guy like you who thinks for a living. All I ever did was pull you out of your wrecked car before you could freeze to death and splint your poor broken legs and give you medicine to ease your pain and take care of you and talk you out of a bad book you’d written and into the best one you ever wrote. And if that’s crazy, take me to the loonybin.”

Oh, Annie, if only someone would, he thought, and before he could stop himself he had snapped: “You also cut off my fucking foot!”

Her hand flickered out whip-quick and rocked his head over to one side with a thin spatting sound.

“Don’t you use that effword around me,” Annie said. “I was raised better even if you weren’t. You’re lucky I didn’t cut off your man-gland. I thought of it, you know.”

He looked at her. His stomach felt like the inside of an icemaker, “I know you did, Annie,” he said softly. Her eyes widened, and for just a moment she looked both startled and guilty—Naughty Annie instead of Nasty Annie.

“Listen to me. Listen closely, Paul. We’re going to be all right if it gets dark before anyone comes to check on that fellow. It’ll be full dark in an hour and a half. If someone comes sooner—”

She reached into the khaki bag again and brought out the trooper’s .44. The cellar lights shone on the zigzagging lightning-bolt the Lawnboy’s blade had chopped into the gun’s barrel.

“If someone comes sooner there’s this,” she said. “For whoever comes, and then you, and then me.”
