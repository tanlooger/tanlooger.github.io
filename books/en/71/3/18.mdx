Once it was dark, she said, she was going to drive the police cruiser up to her Laughing Place. There was a lean-to beside the cabin where she could park it safely out of sight. She thought the only danger of being noticed would come on Route 9, but even there the risk would be small—she only had to drive four miles of it. Once she was off 9, the way into the hills was by little-travelled meadow-line roads, many fallen into casual disuse as grazing cattle this high up became a rarity. A few of these roads, she said, were still gated off—she and Ralph had obtained keys to them when they bought the property. They didn’t have to ask; the owners of the land between the road and the cabin gave them the keys. This was called neighboring, she told Paul, managing to invest a pleasant word with unsuspected depths of nuance: suspicion, contempt, bitter amusement.

“I would take you with me just to keep an eye on you, now that you’ve shown how untrustworthy you can be, but it wouldn’t work. I could get you up there in the back of the police-car, but getting you back down would be impossible. I’m going to have to ride Ralph’s trail-bike. I’ll probably fall off and break my cockadoodie neck!”

She laughed merrily to show what a joke on her that would be, but Paul did not join her.

“If that did happen, Annie, what would happen to me?”

“You’ll be fine, Paul,” she said serenely. “Gosh, you’re such a worry-wart!” She walked over to one of the cellar windows and stood there a moment, looking out, measuring the fall of the day. Paul watched her moodily. If she fell off her husband’s bike or drove off one of those unpaved ridge-roads, he did not actually believe he would be fine. What he actually believed was that he would die a dog’s death down here, and when it was finally over he would make a meal for the rats which were even now undoubtedly watching these two unwelcome bipeds who had intruded upon their domain. There was a Kreig lock on the pantry door now, and a bolt on the bulkhead almost as thick as his wrist. The cellar windows, as if reflecting Annie’s paranoia (and there was nothing strange about that, he thought; didn’t all houses come, after awhile, to reflect the personalities of their inhabitants?), were not much more than dirty gun-slits, about twenty inches long by fourteen wide. He didn’t think he could have wriggled through one of those even on his fittest day, which this wasn’t. He might be able to break one and yell for help if someone showed up here before he starved to death, but that wasn’t much comfort.

The first twinges of pain slipped down his legs like poisoned water. And the want. His body yelling for Novril. It was the gotta, wasn’t it? Sure it was.

Annie came back and took the third bottle of Pepsi. “I’ll bring down another couple of these before I go,” she said. “Right now I need the sugar. You don’t mind, do you?”

“Absolutely not. My Pepsi is your Pepsi.”

She twisted the cap off the bottle and drank deeply. Paul thought: Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, make ya want to holler hi-de-ho. Who was that? Roger Miller, right? Funny, the stuff your mind coughed up.

Hilarious.

“I’m going to put him in his car and drive it up to my Laughing Place. I’m going to take all his things. I’ll put the car in the shed up there and bury him and his . . . you know, his scraps . . . in the woods up there.”

He said nothing. He kept thinking about Bossie, bawling and bawling and bawling until she couldn’t bawl anymore because she was dead, and another of those great axioms of Life on the Western Slope was just this: Dead cows don’t bawl.

“I have a driveway chain. I’m going to use it. If the police come, it may raise suspicion, but I’d rather have them suspicious than have them drive up to the house and hear you making a big cockadoodie fuss. I thought of gagging you, but gags are dangerous, especially if you’re taking drugs that affect respiration. Or you might vomit. Or your sinuses might close up because it’s so damp down here. If your sinuses closed up tight and you couldn’t breathe through your mouth . . .”

She looked away, unplugged, as silent as one of the stones in the cellar wall, as empty as the first bottle of Pepsi she had drunk. Make ya want to holler hi-de-ho. And had Annie hollered hi-de-ho today? Bet your ass. O brethren, Annie had yelled hi-de-ho until the whole yard was oogy. He laughed. She made no sign she had heard him.

Then, slowly, she began to come back.

She looked around at him, blinking.

“I’m going to stick a note through one of the links in the fence,” she said slowly, re-gathering her thoughts. “There’s a town about thirty-five miles from here. It’s called Steamboat Heaven, isn’t that a funny name for a town? The’re having what they call The World’s Biggest Flea Market this week. They have it every summer. There’s always lots of people there who sell ceramics. I’ll write in my note that I’m there, in Steamboat Heaven, looking at ceramics. I’ll say I’m staying overnight. And if anyone asks me later where I stayed, so they can check the register, I’ll say there were no good ceramics so I started back. Only I got tired. That’s what I’ll say. I’ll say I pulled over to take a nap because I was afraid I might fall asleep behind the wheel. I’ll say I only meant to take a short nap but I was so tired from working around the place that I slept all night.”

Paul was dismayed by the depth of this slyness. He suddenly realized that Annie was doing exactly what he could not: she was playing Can You? in real life. Maybe, he thought, that’s why she doesn’t write books. She doesn’t have to.

“I’ll get back just as soon as I can, because policemen will come here,” she said. The prospect did not seem to disturb Annie’s weird serenity in the least, although Paul could not believe that, in some part of her mind, she did not realize how close to the end of the game they had now come. “I don’t think they’ll come tonight—except maybe to cruise by—but they will come. As soon as they know for sure he’s really missing. They’ll go all along his route, looking for him and trying to find out where he stopped, you know, showing up. Don’t you think so, Paul?”

“Yes.”

“I should be back before they come. If I start out on the bike at first light, I might even be able to make it back before noon. I should be able to beat them. Because if he started from Sidewinder, he would have stopped at lots of places before he got here.

“By the time they come, you should be back in your own room, snug as a bug in a rug. I’m not going to tie you up, or gag you, or anything like that, Paul. You can even peek when I go out to talk to them. Because it will be two next time, I think. At least two, don’t you think so?”

Paul did.

She nodded, satisfied. “But I can handle two, if I have to.” She patted the khaki purse. “I want you to remember that kid’s gun while you’re peeking, Paul. I want you to remember that it’s going to be in here all the time I’m talking to those police when they come tomorrow or the next day. The bag won’t be zipped. It’s all right for you to see them, but if they see you, Paul—either by accident or because you try something tomorrow like you did today—if that happens, I’m going to take the gun out of the bag and start shooting. You’re already responsible for that kid’s death.”

“Bullshit,” Paul said, knowing she would hurt him for it but not caring.

She didn’t, though. She only smiled her serene, maternal smile.

“Oh, you know,” she said. “I don’t kid myself that you care, I don’t kid myself about that at all, but you know. I don’t kid myself that you’d care about getting another two people killed, if it would help you . . . but it wouldn’t, Paul. Because if I have to do two, I’ll do four. Them . . . and us. And do you know what? I think you still care about your own skin.”

“Not much,” he said. “I’ll tell you the truth, Annie—every day that passes, my skin feels more and more like something I want to get out of.”

She laughed.

“Oh, I’ve heard that one before. But let them see you put one hand on their oogy old respirators! Then it’s a different story! Yes! When they see that, they yell and cry and turn into a bunch of real brats!”

Not that you ever let that stop you, right, Annie?

“Anyway,” she said, “I just wanted you to know how things are. If you really don’t care, yell your head off when they come. It’s entirely up to you.”

Paul said nothing.

“When they come I’ll stand right out there in the driveway and say yes, there was a state trooper that came by here. I’ll say he came just when I was getting ready to leave for Steamboat Heaven to look at the ceramics. I’ll say he showed me your picture. I’ll say I hadn’t seen you. Then one of them will ask me, ‘This was last winter, Miss Wilkes, how could you be so positive?’ And I’ll say, ‘If Elvis Presley was still alive and you saw him last winter, would you remember seeing him?’ And he’ll say yes, probably so, but what does that have to do with the price of coffee in Borneo, and I’ll say Paul Sheldon is my favorite writer and I’ve seen his picture lots of times. I have to say that, Paul. Do you know why?”

He knew. Her slyness continued to astound him. He supposed it shouldn’t, not anymore, but it did. He remembered the caption below the picture of Annie in her detainment cell, the picture taken in the caesura between the end of the trial and the return of the jury. He remembered it word for word. IN MISERY? NOT THE DRAGON LADY. Annie reads calmly as she waits for the verdict.

“So then,” she continued, “I’ll say the policeman wrote it all down in his book and thanked me. I’ll say I asked him in for a cup of coffee even though I was in a hurry to be on my way and they’ll ask me why. I’ll say he probably knew about my trouble before, and I wanted to satisfy his mind that everything was on the up-and-up here. But he said no, he had to move along. So I asked if he’d like to take a cold Pepsi along with him because the day was so hot and he said yes, thanks, that was very kind.”

She drained her second Pepsi and held the empty plastic bottle between her and him. Seen through the plastic her eye was huge and wavering, the eye of a Cyclops. The side of her head took on a ripply, hydrocephalic bulge.

“I’m going to stop and put this bottle in the ditch about two miles up the road, she said. But first I’ll put his fingers on it, of course.”

She smiled at him—a dry, spitless smile.

“Fingerprints,” she said. “They’ll know he went past my house then. Or they’ll think they do, and that’s just as good, isn’t it, Paul?”

His dismay deepened.

“So they’ll go up the road and they won’t find him. He’ll just be gone. Like those swamis who toot their flutes until ropes come out of baskets and they climb the ropes and disappear. Poof!”

“Poof,” Paul said.

“It won’t take them long to come back. I know that. After all, if they can’t find any trace of him except that one bottle after here, they’ll decide they better think some more about me. After all, I’m crazy, aren’t I? All the papers said so. Nutty as a fruitcake!

“But they’ll believe me at first. I don’t think they’ll actually want to come in and search the house—not at first. They’ll look in other places and try to think of other things before they come back. We’ll have some time. Maybe as much as a week.”

She looked at him levelly.

“You’re going to have to write faster, Paul,” she said.
