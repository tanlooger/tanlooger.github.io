“I guess I’d like that shot after all, Annie,” he said when she had him back in bed.

She studied his white, sweat-beaded face for a moment, then nodded and left the room.

As soon as she was gone, he slid the flat can out of his underwear and under the mattress. He had not put anything under there since the knife, and he did not intend to leave the lighter fluid there long, but it would have to stay there for the rest of the day. Tonight he intended to put it in another, safer place.

She came back and gave him an injection. Then she put a steno pad and some freshly sharpened pencils on the windowsill and rolled his wheelchair over so it was by the bed.

“There,” she said. “I’m going to get some sleep. If a car comes in, I’ll hear it. If we’re left alone, I’ll probably sleep right through until tomorrow morning. If you want to get up and work in longhand, here’s your chair. Your manuscript is over there, on the floor. I frankly don’t advise it until your legs start to warm up a little, though.”

“I couldn’t right now, but I guess I’ll probably soldier along awhile tonight. I understand what you meant about time being short now.”

“I’m glad you do, Paul. How long do you think you need?”

“Under ordinary circumstances, I’d say a month. The way I’ve been working just lately, two weeks. If I really go into overdrive, five days. Or maybe a week. It’ll be ragged, but it’ll be there.”

She sighed and looked down at her hands with dull concentration. “I know it’s going to be less than two weeks.”

“I wish you’d promise me something.”

She looked at him with no anger or suspicion, only faint curiosity. “What?”

“Not to read any more until I’m done . . . or until I have to . . . you know . . .”

“Stop?”

“Yes. Or until I have to stop. That way you’ll get the conclusion without a lot of fragmentation. It’ll have a lot more punch.”

“It’s going to be a good one, isn’t it?”

“Yes.” Paul smiled. “It’s going to be very hot stuff.”
