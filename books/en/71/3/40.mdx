His swollen right hand had not wanted to fill in the missing letters, but he had forced it through the work nonetheless. If he wasn’t able to work at least some of the stiffness out of it, he was not going to be able to carry through with this.

When it was done, he put the pen aside. He regarded his work for a moment. He felt as he always did when he finished a book—queerly empty, let down, aware that for each little success he had paid a toll of absurdity.

It was always the same, always the same—like toiling uphill through jungle and breaking out to a clearing at the top after months of hell only to discover nothing more rewarding than a view of a freeway—with a few gas stations and bowling alleys thrown in for good behavior, or something.

Still, it was good to be done—always good to be done. Good to have produced, to have caused a thing to be. In a numb sort of way he understood and appreciated the bravery of the act, of making little lives that weren’t, creating the appearance of motion and the illusion of warmth. He understood—now, finally—that he was a bit of a dullard at doing this trick, but it was the only one he knew, and if he always ended up doing it ineptly, he at least never failed to do it with love. He touched the pile of manuscript and smiled a little bit.

His hand left the big pile of paper and stole to the single Marlboro she had put on the windowsill for him. Beside it was a ceramic ashtray with a paddlewheel excursion boat printed on the bottom encircled by the words SOUVENIR OF HANNIBAL, MISSOURI—HOME OF AMERICA’S STORY TELLER!

In the ashtray was a book of matches, but there was only one match in it—all she had allowed him. One, however, should be enough.

He could hear her moving around upstairs. That was good. He would have plenty of time to make his few little preparations, plenty of warning if she decided to come down before he was quite ready for her.

Here comes the real trick, Annie. Let’s see if I can do it. Let’s see—can I?

He bent over, ignoring the pain in his legs, and began to work the loose section of baseboard out with his fingers.
