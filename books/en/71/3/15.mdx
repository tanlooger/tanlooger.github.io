He only opened them when he heard the rattle of her key in the kitchen door. His own door was open; he watched her approach down the hall in her old brown cowboy boots and her blue-jeans with the keyring dangling from one of the belt-loops and her man’s tee-shirt now spotted with blood. He cringed away from her. He wanted to say: If you cut anything else off me, Annie, I’m going to die. It won’t take the shock of another amputation, either. I’ll die on purpose. But no words came out—only terrified chuffing noises that disgusted him.

She gave him no time to speak anyway.

“I’ll deal with you later,” she said, and pulled his door closed. One of her keys rattled in the lock—a new Kreig that would have defeated even Tom Twyford himself, Paul thought—and then she was striding down the hall again, the thud of her bootheels mercifully diminishing.

He turned his head and looked dully out the window. He could see only part of the trooper’s body. His head was still under the mower, which was, in turn, canted at a drunken angle against the cruiser. The riding mower was a small tractor-like vehicle meant for keeping larger-than-average lawns neat and clipped. It had not been designed to keep its balance as it passed over jutting rocks, fallen logs, or the heads of state troopers. If the cruiser hadn’t been parked exactly where it was, and if the trooper hadn’t gotten exactly as close to it as he had before Annie struck him, the mower would almost surely have tipped over, spilling her off. This might have caused her no harm at all, but it might have hurt her quite badly.

She has the luck of the devil himself, Paul thought drearily, and watched as she put the mower in neutral and then pushed it off the trooper with one hard shove. The side of the mower squalled along the side of the cruiser and took off some paint.

Now that he was dead, Paul could look at him. The cop looked like a big doll that has been badly treated by a gang of nasty children. Paul felt a terrible aching sympathy for this unnamed young man, but there was another emotion mixed with that. He examined it and was not much surprised to find it was envy. The trooper would never go home to his wife and kids, if he had had them, but on the other hand, he had escaped Annie Wilkes.

She grabbed a bloody hand and dragged him up the driveway and through the barn doors, which stood ajar on their tracks. When she came out, she pushed them along their tracks as far as they would go. Then she walked back down to the cruiser. She was moving with a calm that was almost serenity. She started the cruiser and drove it into the barn. When she came out again she closed the doors almost completely, leaving a gap just wide enough for her to slip in and out.

She walked halfway down the driveway and looked around, hands on her hips. Again Paul saw that remarkable expression of serenity.

The bottom of the mower was smeared with blood, particularly around the grass-exhaust, which was still dripping. Little scraps of khaki uniform lay in the driveway or fluttered in the freshly cut grass of the side lawn. There were daubs and splashes of blood everywhere. The trooper’s gun, with a long slash of bright metal now scarring its barrel, lay in the dust. A square of stiff white paper had caught on the spines of a small cactus Annie had set out in May. Bossie’s splintered cross lay in the driveway like a comment on the whole filthy mess.

She moved out of his field of vision, heading toward the kitchen again. When she came in he heard her singing. “She’ll be driving six white horses when she COMES . . . she’ll be driving six white horses when she COMES! She’ll be driving six white HORSES, driving six white HORSES . . . she’ll be driving six white HORSES when she COMES!”

When he saw her again, she had a big green garbage bag in her hands and three or four more sticking out of the back pockets of her jeans. Big sweatstains darkened her tee-shirt around her armpits and neck. When she turned, he saw a sweatstain that looked vaguely tree-like rising up her back.

That’s a lot of bags for a few scraps of cloth, Paul thought, but he knew that she would have plenty to put in them before she was done.

She picked up the shreds of uniform and then the cross. She broke it into two pieces, and dropped it into the plastic bag. Incredibly, she genuflected after doing this. She picked up the gun, rolled the cylinder, dumped the slugs, put them in one hip pocket, snapped the cylinder back in with a practiced flick of her wrist, and then stuck the gun in the waistband of her jeans. She plucked the piece of paper off the saguaro and looked at it thoughtfully. She stuck it into the other hip pocket. She went to the barn, tossed the garbage bags inside the doors, then came back to the house.

She walked up the side lawn to the cellar bulkhead which was almost directly below Paul’s window. Something else caught her eye. It was his ashtray. She picked it up and handed it politely to him through the broken window.

“Here, Paul.”

Numbly, he took it.

“I’ll get the paper-clips later,” she said, as if this were a question which must already have occurred to him. For one moment he thought of bringing the heavy ceramic ashtray down on her head as she bent over, cleaving her skull with it, letting out the disease that passed for her brains.

Then he thought of what would happen to him—what could happen to him—if he only hurt her, and put the ashtray where it had been with his shaking thumbless hand.

She looked up at him. “I didn’t kill him, you know.”

“Annie—”

“You killed him. If you had kept your mouth shut, I would have sent him on his way. He’d be alive now and there would be none of this oogy mess to clean up.”

“Yes,” Paul said. “Down the road he would have gone, and what about me, Annie?”

She was pulling her hose out of the bulkhead and looping it over her arm. “I don’t know what you mean.”

“Yes you do.” In the depth of his shock he had achieved his own serenity. “He had my picture. It’s in your pocket right now, isn’t it?”

“Ask me no questions and I will tell you no lies.” There was a faucet bib on the side of the house to the left of his window. She began to screw the end of the hose onto it.

“A state cop with my picture means someone found my car. We both knew someone would, I’m only surprised it took so long. In a novel a car might be able to float right out of the story—I guess I could make people believe it if I had to—but in real life, no way. But we went on fooling ourselves just the same, didn’t we, Annie? You because of the book, me because of my life, miserable as it has become to me.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She turned on the faucet. “All I know is you killed that poor kid when you threw the ashtray through the window. You’re getting what might happen to you mixed up with what already happened to him.” She grinned at him. There was craziness in that grin, but he saw something else in it as well, something that really frightened him. He saw conscious evil in it—a demon capering behind her eyes.

“You bitch,” he said.

“Crazy bitch, isn’t that right?” she asked, still smiling.

“Oh yeah—you’re crazy,” he said.

“Well, we’ll have to talk about that, won’t we? When I have more time. We’ll have to talk about that a lot. But right now I’m very busy, as I think you can see.”

She unreeled the hose and turned it on. She spent nearly half an hour hosing blood off the mower and driveway and the side lawn, while interlinked rainbows glimmered in the spray.

Then she twisted the nozzle off and walked back along the hose’s length, looping it over her arm. There was still plenty of light but her shadow trailed long behind her. It was now six o’clock.

She unscrewed the hose, opened the bulkhead, and dropped the green plastic snake inside. She closed the bulkhead, shot the bolt, and stood back, surveying the puddly driveway and the grass, which looked as though a heavy dew had fallen upon it.

Annie walked back to the mower, got on, started it up, and drove it around back. Paul smiled a little. She had the luck of the devil, and when she was pressed she had almost the cleverness of the devil—but almost was the key word. She had slipped in Boulder and wriggled away mostly due to luck. Now she had slipped again. He had seen it. She had washed the blood off the mower but forgotten the blade underneath—the whole blade housing, for that matter. She might remember later, but Paul didn’t think so. Things had a way of dropping out of Annie’s mind once the immediate moment was past. It occurred to him that the mind and the mower had a lot in common—what you could see looked all right. But if you turned the thing over to take a look at the works, you saw a blood-slimed killing machine with a very sharp blade.

She returned to the kitchen door and let herself into the house again. She went upstairs and he heard her rummaging there for awhile. Then she came down again, more slowly, dragging something that sounded soft and heavy. After a moment’s consideration, Paul rolled the wheelchair across to his door and leaned his ear against the wood.

Dim, diminishing footfalls—slightly hollow. And still that soft flumping sound of something being dragged. Immediately his mind lit up with panicky floodlights and his skin flushed with his terror.

Shed! She’s gone to the shed to get the axe! It’s the axe again!

But this was only a momentary atavism, and he pushed it roughly away. She hadn’t gone into the shed; she was going down cellar. Dragging something down cellar.

He heard her come up again and he rolled back to the window. As her bootheels approached his door, as the key slid into the lock again, he thought. She’s come to kill me. And the only emotion this thought engendered was tired relief.
