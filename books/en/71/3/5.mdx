He hadn’t died, hadn’t slept, but for awhile after Annie hobbled him the pain went away. He had only drifted, feeling untethered from his body, a balloon of pure thought rising away from its string.

Oh shit, why was he bothering? She had done it, and all the time between then and now had been pain and boredom and occasional bouts of work on his stupidly melodramatic book to escape the former two. The whole thing was meaningless.

Oh, but it’s not—there is a theme here, Paul. It’s the thread that runs through everything. The thread that runs so true. Can’t you see it?

Misery, of course. That was the thread that ran through everything, but, true thread or false, it was so goddam silly.

As a common noun it meant pain, usually lengthy and often pointless; as a proper one it meant a character and a plot, the latter most assuredly lengthy and pointless, but one which would nonetheless end very soon. Misery ran through the last four (or maybe it was five) months of his life, all right, plenty of Misery, Misery day in and Misery day out, but surely that was too simple, surely—

Oh no, Paul. Nothing is simple about Misery. Except that you owe her your life, such as that may be . . . because you turned out to be Scheherazade after all, didn’t you?

Again he tried to turn aside from these thoughts, but found himself unable. The persistence of memory and all that. Hacks just want to have fun. Then an unexpected idea came, a new one which opened a whole new avenue of thought.

What you keep overlooking, because it’s so obvious, is that you were—are—also Scheherazade to yourself.

He blinked, lowering his hand and staring stupidly out into the summer he had never expected he would see. Annie’s shadow passed and then disappeared again.

Was that true?

Scheherazade to myself? he thought again. If so, then he was faced with an idiocy that was utterly colossal: he owed his survival to the fact that he wanted to finish the piece of shit Annie had coerced him into writing. He should have died . . . but couldn’t. Not until he knew how it all came out.

Oh you’re fucking crazy.

You sure?

No. He was no longer sure. Not about anything. With one exception: his whole life had hinged and continued to hinge on Misery. He let his mind drift.

The cloud, he thought. Begin with the cloud.
