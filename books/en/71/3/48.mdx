Paul’s skin was gray, his body rack-thin. He huddled by the occasional table, shivering all over, staring at them with rolling eyes.

“Who—” McKnight began.

“Goddess,” the scrawny man on the floor interrupted. He licked his lips. “You have to watch out for her. Bedroom. That’s where she kept me. Pet writer. Bedroom. She’s there.”

“Anne Wilkes?” Wicks. “In that bedroom?” He nodded toward the hall.

“Yes. Yes. Locked in. But of course. There’s a window.”

“Who—” McKnight began a second time.

“Christ, can’t you see?” Wicks asked. “It’s the guy Kushner was looking for. The writer. I can’t remember his name, but it’s him.”

“Thank God,” the scrawny man said.

“What?” Wicks bent toward him, frowning.

“Thank God you can’t remember my name.”

“I’m not tracking you, buddy.”

“It’s all right. Never mind. Just . . . you have to be careful. I think she’s dead. But be careful. If she’s still alive . . . dangerous . . . like a rattlesnake.” With tremendous effort he moved his twisted left leg directly into the beam of McKnight’s flashlight. “Cut off my foot. Axe.”

They stared at the place where his foot wasn’t for long long seconds and then McKnight whispered:

“Good Christ.”

“Come on,” Wicks said. He drew his gun and the two of them started slowly down the hall to Paul’s closed bedroom door.

“Watch out for her!” Paul shrieked in his cracked and broken voice. “Be careful!”

They unlocked the door and went in. Paul pulled himself against the wall and leaned his head back, eyes closed. He was cold. He couldn’t stop shivering. They would scream or she would scream. There might be a scuffle. There might be shots. He tried to prepare his mind for either. Time passed, and it seemed to be a very long time indeed.

At last he heard booted feet coming back down the hall. He opened his eyes. It was Wicks.

“She was dead,” Paul said. “I knew it—the real part of my mind did—but I can still hardly be—”

Wicks said: “There’s blood and broken glass and charred paper in there . . . but there’s no one in that room at all.”

Paul Sheldon looked at Wicks, and then he began to scream. He was still screaming when he fainted.
