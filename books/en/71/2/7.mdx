He was already nine pages into Chapter 7—Geoffrey and Mrs. Ramage had managed to get Misery out of her grave in the barest nick of time only to realize that the woman had no idea at all who they were, or who she herself was—when Annie came into the room. This time Paul heard her. He stopped typing, sorry to be out of the dream.

She held the first six chapters at the side of her skirt. It had taken her less than twenty minutes to read his first stab at it; it had been an hour since she had taken this sheaf of twenty-one pages. He looked at her steadily, observing with faint interest that Annie Wilkes was a bit pale.

“Well?” he asked. “Is it fair?”

“Yes,” she said absently, as if this was a foregone conclusion—and Paul supposed it was. “It’s fair. And it’s good. Exciting. But it’s gruesome, too! It’s not like any of the other Misery books. That poor woman who scraped the ends of her fingers off—” She shook her head and repeated: “It’s not like any of the other Misery books.”

The man who wrote these pages was in a rather gruesome frame of mind, my dear, Paul thought.

“Shall I go on?” he asked.

“I’ll kill you if you don’t!” she responded, smiling a little. Paul didn’t smile back. This comment, which would once have struck him as in a league with such banalities as You look so good I could just eat you up now seemed not banal at all.

Yet something in her attitude as she stood in the doorway fascinated him. It was as if she was a little frightened to come any closer—as if she thought something in him might burn her. It wasn’t the subject of premature burial that had done it, and he was wise enough to know it. No—it was the difference between his first try and this one. That first one had had all the life of an eighth-grader’s “How I Spent My Summer Vacation” theme. This one was different. The furnace was on. Oh, not that he had written particularly well—the story was hot, but the characters as stereotyped and predictable as ever—but this time he had been able to at least generate some power; this time there was heat baking out from between the lines.

Amused, he thought: She felt the heat. I think she’s afraid to get too close in case I might burn her.

“Well,” he said mildly, “you won’t have to kill me, Annie. I want to go on. So why don’t I get at it?”

“All right,” she said. She brought the pages to him, put them on the board, and then stepped back quickly.

“Would you like to read it as I go along?” he asked.

Annie smiled. “Yes! It would be almost like the chapter-plays, when I was a kid!”

“Well, I can’t promise a cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter,” he said. “It just doesn’t work that way.”

“It will for me,” she said fervently. “I’d want to know what was going to happen in Chapter 18 even if 17 ended with Misery and Ian and Geoffrey sitting in armchairs on the porch, reading newspapers. I’m already wild to know what’s going to happen next—don’t tell me!” she added sharply, as if Paul had offered to do this.

“Well, I generally don’t show my work until it’s all done,” he said, and then smiled at her. “But since this is a special situation, I’ll be happy to let you read it chapter by chapter.” And so began the thousand and one nights of Paul Sheldon, he thought. “But I wonder if you’d do something for me?”

“What?”

“Fill in these damned n’s,” he said.

She smiled at him radiantly. “It would be an honor. I’ll leave you alone now.”

She went back to the door, hesitated there, and turned back. Then, with a deep and almost painful timidity, she offered the only editorial suggestion she ever made to him. “Maybe it was a bee.”

He had already dropped his gaze to the sheet of paper in the typewriter; he was looking for the hole. He wanted to get Misery back to Mrs. Ramage’s cottage before he knocked off, and he looked back up at Annie with carefully disguised impatience. “I beg pardon?”

“A bee,” she said, and he saw a blush creeping up her neck and over her cheeks. Soon even her ears were glowing. “One person in every dozen is allergic to bee-venom. I saw lots of cases of it before . . . before I retired from service as an R.N. The allergy can show in lots of different ways. Sometimes a sting can cause a comatose condition which is . . . is similar to what people used to call . . . uh . . . catalepsy.”

Now she was so red she was almost purple.

Paul held the idea up briefly in his mind and then tossed it on the scrap-heap. A bee could have been the cause of Miss Evelyn-Hyde’s unfortunate live burial; it even made sense, since it had happened in mid-spring; in the garden, to boot. But he had already decided that credibility depended on the two live burials’ being related somehow, and Misery had succumbed in her bedroom. The fact that late fall was hardly bee-season was not really the problem. The problem was the rarity of the cataleptic reaction. He thought Constant Reader would not swallow two unrelated women in neighboring townships being buried alive six months apart as a result of bee-stings.

Yet he could not tell Annie that, and not just because it might rile her up. He could not tell her because it would hurt her badly, and in spite of all the pain she had afforded him, he found he could not hurt her in that way. He had been hurt that way himself.

He fell back on that most common writers’-workshop euphemism: “It’s got possibilities, all right. I’ll drop it into the hopper, Annie, but I’ve already got some ideas in mind. It may not fit.”

“Oh, I know that—you’re the writer, not me. Just forget I said anything. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be s—”

But she was gone, her heavy tread almost running down the hallway to the parlor. He was looking at an empty space. His eyes dropped—then widened.

On either side of the doorway, about eight inches up from the floor, was a black mark—they had been left, he understood at once, by the hubs of the wheelchair when he forced it through. So far she hadn’t noticed them. It had been almost a week, and her failure to notice was a small miracle. But soon—tomorrow, perhaps even this afternoon—she would be in to vacuum, and then she would.

She would.

Paul managed very little during the rest of the day.

The hole in the paper had disappeared.
