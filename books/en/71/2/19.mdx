An hour later, full of dope and drifting off to sleep, the sound of the howling wind now soothing rather than frightening, he thought: I’m not going to escape. No way. What is it Thomas Hardy says in Jude the Obscure? “Someone could have come along and eased the boy’s terror, but nobody did . . . because nobody does.” Right. Correct. Your ship is not going to come in because there are no boats for nobody. The Lone Ranger is busy making breakfast-cereal commercials and Superman’s making movies in Tinsel Town.

He answered with no hesitation at all. Yes, I can.

His eyes drifted closed. He slept.
