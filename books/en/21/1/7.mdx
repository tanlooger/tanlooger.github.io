title: CHAPTER 7. A DAY WITH THE BEAVERS
---

WHILE the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried "Oh!" andstopped.

"The robin!" cried Lucy, "the robin. It's flown away." And so it had - right out of sight.

"And now what are we to do?" said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much asto say "What did I tell you?"

"Sh! Look!" said Susan.

"What?" said Peter.

"There's something moving among the trees over there to the left."

They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.

"There it goes again," said Susan presently.

"I saw it that time too," said Peter. "It's still there. It's just gone behind that big tree."

"What is it?" asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.

"Whatever it is," said Peter, "it's dodging us. It's something that doesn't want to be seen."

"Let's go home," said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyonesuddenly realized the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the lastchapter. They were lost.

"What's it like?" said Lucy.

"It's - it's a kind of animal," said Susan; and then, "Look! Look! Quick! There it is."

They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them frombehind a tree. But this time it didn't immediately draw back. Instead, the animal put itspaw against its mouth just as humans put their finger on their lips when they aresignalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared again. The children, all stood holdingtheir breath.

A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it wereafraid someone was watching, said "Hush", made signs to them to join it in the thicker bitof wood where it was standing, and then once more disappeared.

"I know what it is," said Peter; "it's a beaver. I saw the tail."

"It wants us to go to it," said Susan, "and it is warning us not to make a noise."

"I know," said Peter. "The question is, are we to go to it or not? What do you think, Lu?"

"I think it's a nice beaver," said Lucy.

"Yes, but how do we know?" said Edmund.

"Shan't we have to risk it?" said Susan. "I mean, it's no good just standing here and I feelI want some dinner."

At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckonedearnestly to them.

"Come on," said Peter,"let's give it a try. All keep close together. We ought to be a matchfor one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy."

So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there,sure enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarsethroaty whisper, "Further in, come further in. Right in here. We're not safe in the open!"

Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together thattheir boughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot becauseno snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk to them.

"Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?" it said.

"We're some of them," said Peter.

"S-s-s-sh!" said the Beaver, "not so loud please. We're not safe even here."

"Why, who are you afraid of?" said Peter. "There's no one here but ourselves."

"There are the trees," said the Beaver. "They're always listening. Most of them are on ourside, but there are trees that would betray us to her; you know who I mean," and itnodded its head several times.

"If it comes to talking about sides," said Edmund, "how do we know you're a friend?"

"Not meaning to be rude, Mr Beaver," added Peter, "but you see, we're strangers."

"Quite right, quite right," said the Beaver. "Here is my token." With these words it heldup to them a little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said,"Oh, of course. It's my handkerchief - the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus."

"That's right," said the Beaver. "Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest before it actuallyhappened and handed this over to me. He said that if anything happened to him I mustmeet you here and take you on to -" Here the Beaver's voice sank into silence and it gave

one or two very mysterious nods. Then signalling to the children to stand as close aroundit as they possibly could, so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it addedin a low whisper -

"They say Aslan is on the move - perhaps has already landed."

And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was anymore than you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quitedifferent. Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone sayssomething which you don't understand but in the dream it feels as if it had someenormous meaning - either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmareor else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream sobeautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into thatdream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children feltsomething jump in its inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter feltsuddenly brave and adventurous. Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightfulstrain of music had just floated by her. And Lucy got the feeling you have when youwake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays or thebeginning of summer.

"And what about Mr Tumnus," said Lucy; "where is he?"

"S-s-s-sh," said the Beaver, "not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk andalso dinner."

No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the beaver now, and everyone,including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word "dinner".

They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisinglyquick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour. Everyone wasfeeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in frontof them and the ground to fall steeply downhill. A minute later they came out under theopen sky (the sun was still shining) and found themselves looking down on a fine sight.

They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran - atleast it would have been running if it hadn't been frozen - a fairly large river. Just belowthem a dam had been built across this river, and when they saw it everyone suddenlyremembered that of course beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that MrBeaver had made this one. They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expressionon his, face - the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they've made orreading a story they've written. So it was only common politeness when Susan said,"What a lovely dam!" And Mr Beaver didn't say "Hush" this time but "Merely a trifle!

Merely a trifle! And it isn't really finished!"

Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now, of course, alevel floor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but

instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which thewater had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came. And where thewater had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glitteringwall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with flowers andwreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on top of thedam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole inthe roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it {especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.

That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A littlelower down the river there was another small river which came down another smallvalley to join it. And looking up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and hewas almost sure they were the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to himwhen he parted from her at the lamp-post that other day. And then between them, hethought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less. And he thought about TurkishDelight and about being a King ("And I wonder how Peter will like that?" he askedhimself) and horrible ideas came into his head.

"Here we are," said Mr Beaver, "and it looks as if Mrs Beaver is expecting us. I'll lead theway. But be careful and don't slip."

The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for humans) a very niceplace to walk because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level withit on one side, there was a nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route MrBeaver led them in single file right out to the middle where they could look a long wayup the river and a long way down it. And when they had reached the middle they were atthe door of the house.

"Here we are, Mrs Beaver," said Mr Beaver, "I've found them. Here are the Sons andDaughters of Adam and Eve'- and they all went in.

The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the first thing shesaw was a kindlooking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouthworking busily at her sewing machine, and it was from it that the sound came. Shestopped her work and got up as soon as the children came in.

"So you've come at last!" she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws. "At last! Tothink that ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle'ssinging and I daresay, Mr Beaver, you'll get us some fish."

"That I will," said Mr Beaver, and he went out of the house (Peter went with him), andacross the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept openevery day with his hatchet. They took a pail with them. Mr Beaver sat down quietly at theedge of the hole (he didn't seem to mind it being so chilly), looked hard into it, thensuddenly shot in his paw, and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out abeautiful trout. Then he did it all over again until they had a fine catch of fish.

Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the kettle and lay the table and cutthe bread and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaverfrom a barrel which stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying-pan and getthe dripping hot. Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was notat all like Mr Tumnus's cave. There were no books or pictures, and instead of beds therewere bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall. And there were hams and strings ofonions hanging from the roof, and against the walls were gum boots and oilskins andhatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in andfishing-rods and fishing-nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table, though very clean,was very rough.

Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fishwhich Mr Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air. Youcan think how good the new-caught fish smelled while they were frying and how thehungry children longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they hadbecome before Mr Beaver said, "Now we're nearly ready." Susan drained the potatoesand then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucywas helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few minutes everyone wasdrawing up their stools (it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers' house except forMrs Beaver's own special rockingchair beside the fire) and preparing to enjoythemselves. There was a jug of creamy milk for the children (Mr Beaver stuck to beer)and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from whicheveryone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes, and all the children thought- and I agree with them - that there's nothing to beat good freshwater fish if you eat itwhen it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan half a minute ago.

And when they had finished the fish Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven agreat and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved thekettle on to the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was madeand ready to be poured out. And when each person had got his (or her) cup of tea, eachperson shoved back his (or her) stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave along sigh of contentment.

"And now," said Mr Beaver, pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of teatowards him, "if you'll just wait till I've got my pipe lit up and going nicely - why, nowwe can get to business. It's snowing again," he added, cocking his eye at the window.

"That's all the better, because it means we shan't have any visitors; and if anyone shouldhave been trying to follow you, why he won't find any tracks."
