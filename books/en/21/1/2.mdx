title: CHAPTER 2. WHAT LUCY FOUND THERE
---

"GOOD EVENING," said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up its parcels that atfirst it did not reply. When it had finished it made her a little bow.

"Good evening, good evening," said the Faun. "Excuse me - I don't want to be inquisitive- but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?"

"My name's Lucy," said she, not quite understanding him.

"But you are - forgive me - you are what they call a girl?" said the Faun.

"Of course I'm a girl," said Lucy.

"You are in fact Human?"

"Of course I'm human," said Lucy, still a little puzzled.

"To be sure, to be sure," said the Faun. "How stupid of me! But I've never seen a Son ofAdam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say -" and then it stopped asif it had been going to say something it had not intended but had remembered in time.

"Delighted, delighted," it went on. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus."

"I am very pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy.

"And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve," said Mr Tumnus, "how you have come intoNarnia?"

"Narnia? What's that?" said Lucy.

"This is the land of Narnia," said the Faun, "where we are now; all that lies between thelamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you - you havecome from the wild woods of the west?"

"I - I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room," said Lucy.

"Ah!" said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, "if only I had worked harder atgeography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strangecountries. It is too late now."

"But they aren't countries at all," said Lucy, almost laughing. "It's only just back there - atleast - I'm not sure. It is summer there."

"Meanwhile," said Mr Tumnus, "it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, andwe shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from thefar land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe,how would it be if you came and had tea with me?"

"Thank you very much, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "But I was wondering whether I oughtto be getting back."

"It's only just round the corner," said the Faun, "and there'll be a roaring fire - and toast -

and sardines - and cake."

"Well, it's very kind of you," said Lucy. "But I shan't be able to stay long."

"If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve," said Mr Tumnus, "I shall be able to hold theumbrella over both of us. That's the way. Now - off we go."

And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strangecreature as if they had known one another all their lives.

They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough andthere were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of onesmall valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight intoan unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into theentrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of awood fire. Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the firewith a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. "Now we shan't be long," he said, andimmediately put a kettle on.

Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave ofreddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs ("one for me and one for afriend," said Mr Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire andabove that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard. In one corner there was a doorwhich Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus's bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf fullof books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things. They had titles likeThe Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men, Monks andGamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?

"Now, Daughter of Eve!" said the Faun.

And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each ofthem, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, andthen a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. Hehad wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances andhow the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out todance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could giveyou wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild RedDwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summerwhen the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them,and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead ofwater and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. "Notthat it isn't always winter now," he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took outfrom its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of strawand began to play. And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and danceand go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours later when she shook herselfand said:

"Oh, Mr Tumnus - I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune - but really, I must gohome. I only meant to stay for a few minutes."

"It's no good now, you know," said the Faun, laying down its flute and shaking its head ather very sorrowfully.

"No good?" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. "What do you mean?

I've got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me." Buta moment later she asked, "Mr Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?" for the Faun's browneyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soonthey were running off the end of its nose; and at last it covered its face with its hands andbegan to howl.

"Mr Tumnus! Mr Tumnus!" said Lucy in great distress. "Don't! Don't! What is thematter? Aren' you well? Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong." But the Fauncontinued sobbing as if its heart would break. And even when Lucy went over and puther arms round him and lent him her hand kerchief, he did not stop. He merely took thehandker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got toowet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.

"Mr Tumnus!" bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. "Do stop. Stop it at once! You oughtto be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What on earth are you cryingabout?"

"Oh - oh - oh!" sobbed Mr Tumnus, "I'm crying because I'm such a bad Faun."

"I don't think you're a bad Faun at all," said Lucy. "I think you are a very good Faun. Youare the nicest Faun I've ever met."

"Oh - oh - you wouldn't say that if you knew," replied Mr Tumnus between his sobs. "No,I'm a bad Faun. I don't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of theworld."

"But what have you done?" asked Lucy.

"My old father, now," said Mr Tumnus; "that's his picture over the mantelpiece. Hewould never have done a thing like this."

"A thing like what?" said Lucy.

"Like what I've done," said the Faun. "Taken service under the White Witch. That's whatI am. I'm in the pay of the White Witch."

"The White Witch? Who is she?"

"Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It's she that makes it alwayswinter. Always winter and never Christmas; think of that!"

"How awful!" said Lucy. "But what does she pay you for?"

"That's the worst of it," said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan. "I'm a kidnapper for her,that's what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would you believe that I'm the sort ofFaun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood, one that had never done me any harm,and pretend to be friendly with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lullingit asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch?"

"No," said Lucy. "I'm sure you wouldn't do anything of the sort."

"But I have," said the Faun.

"Well," said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet not be too hard onhim), "well, that was pretty bad. But you're so sorry for it that I'm sure you will never doit again."

"Daughter of Eve, don't you understand?" said the Faun. "It isn't something I have done.

I'm doing it now, this very moment."

"What do you mean?" cried Lucy, turning very white.

"You are the child," said Tumnus. "I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw aSon of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and hand them overto her. And you are the first I've ever met. And I've pretended to be your friend an askedyou to tea, and all the time I've been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go andtell Her."

"Oh, but you won't, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "Yo won't, will you? Indeed, indeed youreally mustn't."

"And if I don't," said he, beginning to cry again "she's sure to find out. And she'll havemy tail cut off and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she'll wave herwand over my beautiful clove hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like wretchedhorse's. And if she is extra and specially angry she'll turn me into stone and I shall beonly statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filledand goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all."

"I'm very sorry, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "But please let me go home."

"Of course I will," said the Faun. "Of course I've got to. I see that now. I hadn't knownwhat Humans were like before I met you. Of course I can't give you up to the Witch; notnow that I know you. But we must be off at once. I'll see you back to the lamp-post. Isuppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?"

"I'm sure I can," said Lucy.

"We must go as quietly as we can," said Mr Tumnus. "The whole wood is full of herspies. Even some of the trees are on her side."

They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus once more put uphis umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey backwas not at all like the journey to the Faun's cave; they stole along as quickly as theycould, without speaking a word, and Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy wasrelieved when they reached the lamp-post again.

"Do you know your way from here, Daughter o Eve?" said Tumnus.

Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of lightthat looked like daylight. "Yes," she said, "I can see the wardrobe door."

"Then be off home as quick as you can," said the Faun, "and - c-can you ever forgive mefor what meant to do?"

"Why, of course I can," said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand. "And I do hope youwon't get into dreadful trouble on my account."

"Farewell, Daughter of Eve," said he. "Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?"

"Rather!" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight as quickly as herlegs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her she feltcoats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden board and all at onceshe found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the

whole adventure had started. She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and lookedaround, panting for breath. It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the othersin the passage.

"I'm here," she shouted. "I'm here. I've come back I'm all right."
