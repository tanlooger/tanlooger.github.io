title: CHAPTER 12. PETER'S FIRST BATTLE
---

WHILE the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beavers and thechildren were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long agothey had left the coats behind them. And by now they had even stopped saying to oneanother, "Look! there's a kingfisher," or "I say, bluebells!" or "What was that lovelysmell?" or "Just listen to that thrush!" They walked on in silence drinking it all in, passingthrough patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossyglades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses offlowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almostoverpowering.

They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and thewhole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn't even knownfor certain (as the Witch did) that this was what would happen when Aslan came toNarnia. But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter;and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gonewrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch's schemes. And after the thaw had been goingon for some time they all realized that the Witch would no longer be able to use hersledge. After that they didn't hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests andlonger ones. They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I'd call bitterly tired -

only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming tothe end of a long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.

They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn a little to theright (that meant a little to the south) to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if thishad not been their way they couldn't have kept to the river valley once the thaw began,for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood - a wonderful, roaring,thundering yellow flood - and their path would have been under water.

And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and theflowers began to think about closing.

"Not long now," said Mr Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep,springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place where only tall trees grew, verywide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow.

And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without anotherlong rest, suddenly they were at the top. And this is what they saw.

They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forestspreading as far as one could see in every direction - except right ahead. There, far to theEast, was something twinkling and moving. "By gum!" whispered Peter to Susan, "thesea!" In the very middle of this open hill-top was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slabof grey stone supported on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all overwith strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language. Theygave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was apavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was - andespecially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it - with sides of what lookedlike yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole abanner which bore a red rampant lion fluttering in the breeze which was blowing in theirfaces from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music ontheir right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.

Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves round himin the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women (Dryadsand Naiads as they used to be called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it wasthey who had made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of themwas like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants.

There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle,and a great Dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crownand the other his standard.

But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn't know what to do or saywhen they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thingcannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, theywere cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan's face they just caught aglimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and thenthey found they couldn't look at him and went all trembly.

"Go on," whispered Mr Beaver.

"No," whispered Peter, "you first."

"No, Sons of Adam before animals," whispered Mr Beaver back again.

"Susan," whispered Peter, "What about you? Ladies first."

"No, you're the eldest," whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doingthis the more awkward they felt. Then at last Peter realized that it was up to him. He drewhis sword and raised it to the salute and hastily saying to the others "Come on. Pullyourselves together," he advanced to the Lion and said:

"We have come - Aslan."

"Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam," said Aslan. "Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters ofEve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver."

His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. They now feltglad and quiet and it didn't seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing.

"But where is the fourth?" asked Aslan.

"He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan," said Mr Beaver. Andthen something made Peter say,

"That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think that helped him to gowrong."

And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood lookingat him with his great unchanging eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there wasnothing to be said.

"Please - Aslan," said Lucy, "can anything be done to save Edmund?"

"All shall be done," said Aslan. "But it may be harder than you think." And then he wassilent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal andstrong and peaceful his face looked; now it suddenly came into her head that he lookedsad as well. But next minute that expression was quite gone. The Lion shook his maneand clapped his paws together ("Terrible paws," thought Lucy, "if he didn't know how tovelvet them!") and said,

"Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilionand minister to them."

When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw - and though it was velveted it was veryheavy - on Peter's shoulder and said, "Come, Son of Adam, and I will show you a far-offsight of the castle where you are to be King."

And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge ofthe hilltop. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs.

That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light - forest and hillsand valleys and, winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. Andbeyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds whichwere just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset. But just where the land ofNarnia met the sea - in fact, at the mouth of the great river - there was something on alittle hill, shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight wasreflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but to Peter itlooked like a great star resting on the seashore.

"That, O Man," said Aslan, "is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one of which you mustsit as King. I show it to you because you are the first-born and you will be High Kingover all the rest."

And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise woke the silencesuddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.

"It is your sister's horn," said Aslan to Peter in a low voice; so low as to be almost a purr,if it is not disrespectful to think of a Lion purring.

For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the other creatures startforward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw, "Back! Let the Prince win hisspurs," he did understand, and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion. Andthere he saw a dreadful sight.

The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards himas fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper. Then he sawSusan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast. Atfirst Peter thought it was a bear. Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it wasfar too big to be a dog. Then he realized that it was a wolf - a wolf standing on its hindlegs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk, snapping and snarling. All the hair on itsback stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch.

One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snappingteeth. Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip; then herealized that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.

Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made nodifference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash ofhis sword at its side. That stroke never reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turnedround, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been soangry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once. As it was -

though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all - he had just time to duckdown and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the brute's forelegs into itsheart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He wastugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teethknocked against his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A momentlater he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and wasstraightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes. He felt tiredall over.

Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty shaky when theymet and I won't say there wasn't kissing and crying on both sides. But in Narnia no onethinks any the worse of you for that.

"Quick! Quick!" shouted the voice of Aslan. "Centaurs! Eagles! I see another wolf in thethickets. There - behind you. He has just darted away. After him, all of you. He will begoing to his mistress. Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son ofAdam." And instantly with a thunder of hoofs and beating of wings a dozen or so of theswiftest creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness.

Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.

"You have forgotten to clean your sword," said Aslan.

It was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared withthe Wolf's hair and blood. He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass, andthen wiped it quite dry on his coat.

"Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam," said Aslan. And when Peter had done so hestruck him with the flat of the blade and said, "Rise up, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane. And,whatever happens, never forget to wipe your sword."

Now we must get back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk far further than hehad ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley allovershadowed with fir trees and yew trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on hisface doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next providedthey would let him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty hewas. The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.

"No," said the dwarf, "it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reached the StoneTable by now."

"Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news," said the Witch.

"It cannot be good news if he does," said the dwarf.

"Four thrones in Cair Paravel," said the Witch. "How if only three were filled? Thatwould not fulfil the prophecy."

"What difference would that make now that He is here?" said the dwarf. He did not dare,even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.

"He may not stay long. And then - we would fall upon the three at Cair."

"Yet it might be better," said the dwarf, "to keep this one" (here he kicked Edmund) "forbargaining with."
