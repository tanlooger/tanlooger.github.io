title: CHAPTER 11. ASLAN IS NEARER
---

EDMUND meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the dwarf hadgone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him, asshe had been at their last meeting. But she said nothing at all. And when at last Edmundplucked up his courage to say, "Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight?

You - you - said -" she answered, "Silence, fool!" Then she appeared to change her mindand said, as if to herself, a "And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way,"and once more clapped her hands. Another, dwarf appeared.

"Bring the human creature food and drink," she said.

The dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in itand an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned in a repulsive manner as heset them down on the floor beside Edmund and said:

"Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha! Ha! Ha!"

"Take it away," said Edmund sulkily. "I don't want dry bread." But the Witch suddenlyturned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he, apologized and began tonibble at the bread, though, it was so stale he could hardly get it down.

"You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again," said the Witch.

While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledgewas ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her. Thesnow was again falling as they came into the courtyard, but she took no notice of that andmade Edmund sit beside her on the sledge. But before they drove off she called Maugrimand he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.

"Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers,"said the Witch, "and kill whatever you find there. If they are already gone, then make allspeed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen. Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhilemust go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river.

You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table. You will know whatto do if you find them!"

"I hear and obey, O Queen," growled the Wolf, and immediately he shot away into thesnow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he had calledanother wolf and was with him down on the dam sniffing at the Beavers' house. But ofcourse they found it empty. It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and thechildren if the night had remained fine, for the wolves would then have been able tofollow their trail - and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to thecave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprintswere covered up.

Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and Edmund drove outunder the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible

journey for Edmund, who had no coat. Before they had been going quarter of an hour allthe front of him was covered with snow - he soon stopped trying to shake it off because,as quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was wet to theskin. And oh, how miserable he was! It didn't look now as if the Witch intended to makehim a King. All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good andkind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now. He would havegiven anything to meet the others at this moment - even Peter! The only way to comforthimself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he mightwake up at any moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like adream.

This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But Iwill skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and theywere racing along in the daylight. And still they went on and on, with no sound but theeverlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer's harness. And then at lastthe Witch said, "What have we here? Stop!" and they did.

How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast! But she hadstopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party,a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dogfox,all on stools round a table. Edmund couldn't quite see what they were eating, but itsmelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn't at all sure thathe didn't see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when the sledge stopped, theFox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding aglass in its right paw as if it was going to say something. But when the whole party sawthe sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The fathersquirrel stopped eating with his fork half-way to his mouth and one of the satyrs stoppedwith its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked with terror.

"What is the meaning of this?" asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.

"Speak, vermin!" she said again. "Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with hiswhip? What is the meaning of all this gluttony, this waste, this selfindulgence? Where didyou get all these things?"

"Please, your Majesty," said the Fox, "we were given them. And if I might make so boldas to drink your Majesty's very good health - "

"Who gave them to you?" said the Witch.

"F-F-F-Father Christmas," stammered the Fox.

"What?" roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer tothe terrified animals. "He has not been here! He cannot have been here! How dare you -

but no. Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven."

At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.

"He has - he has - he has!" it squeaked, beating its little spoon on the table. Edmund sawthe Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek. Then sheraised her wand. "Oh, don't, don't, please don't," shouted Edmund, but even while he wasshouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been therewere only statues of creatures (one with its stone fork fixed forever half-way to its stonemouth) seated round a stone table on which there were stone plates and a stone plumpudding.

"As for you," said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re-

mounted the sledge, "let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!"And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself. Itseemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sitting there all the silent days andall the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their facescrumbled away.

Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow whichsplashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all lastnight. At the same time he noticed that he was feeling much less cold. It was alsobecoming foggy. In fact every minute it grew foggier and warmer. And the sledge wasnot running nearly as well as it had been running up till now. At first he thought this wasbecause the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn't be the real reason. Thesledge jerked, and skidded and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones. Andhowever the dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower. Therealso seemed to be a curious noise all round them, but the noise of their driving and joltingand the dwarf's shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was,until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn't go on at all. When that happenedthere was a moment's silence. And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the othernoise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling, chattering noise - and yet not so strange, forhe'd heard it before - if only he could remember where! Then all at once he didremember. It was the noise of running water. All round them though out of sight, therewere streams, chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the distance)roaring. And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew why) when he realizedthat the frost was over. And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from the branches ofall the trees. And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off itand for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree. Buthe hadn't time to listen or watch any longer, for the Witch said:

"Don't sit staring, fool! Get out and help."

And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow - but it was really onlyslush by now - and began helping the dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it hadgot into. They got it out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the dwarfmanaged to get it on the move again, and they drove a little further. And now the snowwas really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in

every direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had beenlooking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches wereafter the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.

"It's no good, your Majesty," said the dwarf. "We can't sledge in this thaw."

"Then we must walk," said the Witch.

"We shall never overtake them walking," growled the dwarf. "Not with the start they'vegot."

"Are you my councillor or my slave?" said the Witch. "Do as you're told. Tie the hands ofthe human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope. And take your whip.

And cut the harness of the reindeer; they'll find their own way home."

The dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk asfast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept on slipping in the slush and mudand wet grass, and every time he slipped the dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes aflick with the whip. The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying, "Faster!

Faster!"

Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of spow grew smaller.

Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow. Soon, whereveryou looked, instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of firs or the black pricklybranches of bare oaks and beeches and elms. Then the mist turned from white to gold andpresently cleared away altogether. Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on to theforest floor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree tops.

Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner intoa glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with littleyellow flowers - celandines. The noise of water grew louder. Presently they actuallycrossed a stream. Beyond it they found snowdrops growing.

"Mind your own business!" said the dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his headto look at them; and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.

But of course this didn't prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he noticeda dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree - gold and purple and white. Thencame a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path theywere following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by thechuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a signal, therewas chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, andwithin five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds' music, and whereverEdmund's eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasingone another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.

"Faster! Faster!" said the Witch.

There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there werewhite clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there wereprimroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swayingbranches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travellers. The treesbegan to come fully alive. The larches and birches were covered with green, thelaburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves.

As the travellers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed acrosstheir path.

"This is no thaw," said the dwarf, suddenly stopping. "This is Spring. What are we to do?

Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you! This is Aslan's doing."

"If either of you mention that name again," said the Witch, "he shall instantly be killed."
