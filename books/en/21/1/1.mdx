title: CHAPTER 1. LUCY LOOKS INTO A WARDROBE
---

ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Thisstory is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from Londonduring the war because of the air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professorwho lived in the heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and twomiles from the nearest post office. He had no wife and he lived in a very large house witha housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three servants. (Their names were Ivy, Margaretand Betty, but they do not come into the story much.) He himself was a very old manwith shaggy white hair which grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and theyliked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at thefront door he was so odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little afraid ofhim, and Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted to laugh and had to keep onpretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.

As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night,the boys came into the girls' room and they all talked it over.

"We've fallen on our feet and no mistake," said Peter. "This is going to be perfectlysplendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like."

"I think he's an old dear," said Susan.

"Oh, come off it!" said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, whichalways made him bad-tempered. "Don't go on talking like that."

"Like what?" said Susan; "and anyway, it's time you were in bed."

"Trying to talk like Mother," said Edmund. "And who are you to say when I'm to go tobed? Go to bed yourself."

"Hadn't we all better go to bed?" said Lucy. "There's sure to be a row if we're heardtalking here."

"No there won't," said Peter. "I tell you this is the sort of house where no one's going tomind what we do. Anyway, they won't hear us. It's about ten minutes' walk from heredown to that dining-room, and any amount of stairs and passages in between."

"What's that noise?" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever beenin before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into emptyrooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.

"It's only a bird, silly," said Edmund.

"It's an owl," said Peter. "This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bednow. I say, let's go and explore tomorrow. You might find anything in a place like this.

Did you see those mountains as we came along? And the woods? There might be eagles.

There might be stags. There'll be hawks."

"Badgers!" said Lucy.

"Foxes!" said Edmund.

"Rabbits!" said Susan.

But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when youlooked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor eventhe stream in the garden.

"Of course it would be raining!" said Edmund. They had just finished their breakfast withthe Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them - a long, low roomwith two windows looking out in one direction and two in another.

"Do stop grumbling, Ed," said Susan. "Ten to one it'll clear up in an hour or so. And inthe meantime we're pretty well off. There's a wireless and lots of books."

"Not for me"said Peter; "I'm going to explore in the house."

Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of housethat you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places. The firstfew doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that theywould; but soon they came to a very long room full of pictures and there they found a suitof armour; and after that was a room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; andthen came three steps down and five steps up, and then a kind of little upstairs hall and adoor that led out on to a balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into eachother and were lined with books - most of them very old books and some bigger than aBible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite emptyexcept for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door. There wasnothing else in the room at all except a dead blue-bottle on the window-sill.

"Nothing there!" said Peter, and they all trooped out again - all except Lucy. She stayedbehind because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe, eventhough she felt almost sure that it would be locked. To her surprise it opened quite easily,and two moth-balls dropped out.

Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up - mostly long fur coats. Therewas nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately steppedinto the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leavingthe door open, of course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into anywardrobe. Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coatshanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her armsstretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe. Shetook a step further in - then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork againstthe tips of her fingers. But she could not feel it.

"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!" thought Lucy, going still further in andpushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that therewas something crunching under her feet. "I wonder is that more mothballs?" she thought,stooping down to feel it with her hand. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood ofthe floor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. "Thisis very queer," she said, and went on a step or two further.

Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longersoft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. "Why, it is just like branches oftrees!" exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a fewinches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off.

Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she wasstanding in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakesfalling through the air.

Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She lookedback over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree trunks; she could still see theopen doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from whichshe had set out. (She had, of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very sillything to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) It seemed to be still daylight there. "I can alwaysget back if anything goes wrong," thought Lucy. She began to walk forward, crunch-

crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light. In about ten minutesshe reached it and found it was a lamp-post. As she stood looking at it, wondering whythere was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she hearda pitter patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strange personstepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.

He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella,white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shapedlike a goat's (the hair on them was glossy black) and instead of feet he had goat's hoofs.

He also had a tail, but Lucy did not notice this at first because it was neatly caught upover the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow. He had ared woollen muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too. He had a strange,but pleasant little face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair therestuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead. One of his hands, as I have said, held

the umbrella: in the other arm he carried several brown-paper parcels. What with theparcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. Hewas a Faun. And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped allhis parcels.

"Goodness gracious me!" exclaimed the Faun.
