title: CHAPTER 10. THE SPELL BEGINS TO BREAK
---

Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. As soon as MrBeaver said, "There's no time to lose," everyone began bundling themselves into coats,except Mrs Beaver, who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said:"Now, Mr Beaver, just reach down that ham. And here's a packet of tea, and there's sugar,and some matches. And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock overthere in the corner."

"What are you doing, Mrs Beaver?" exclaimed Susan.

"Packing a load for each of us, dearie," said Mrs Beaver very coolly. "You didn't thinkwe'd set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?"

"But we haven't time!" said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat. "She may be here anyminute."

"That's what I say," chimed in Mr Beaver.

"Get along with you all," said his wife. "Think it over, Mr Beaver. She can't be here forquarter of an hour at least."

"But don't we want as big a start as we can possibly get," said Peter, "if we're to reach theStone Table before her?"

"You've got to remember that, Mrs Beaver," said Susan. "As soon as she has looked inhere and finds we're gone she'll be off at top speed."

"That she will," said Mrs Beaver. "But we can't get there before her whatever we do, forshe'll be on a sledge and we'll be walking."

"Then - have we no hope?" said Susan.

"Now don't you get fussing, there's a dear," said Mrs Beaver, "but just get half a dozenclean handkerchiefs out of the drawer. 'Course we've got a hope. We can't get therebefore her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she won't expect and perhapswe'll get through."

"That's true enough, Mrs Beaver," said her husband. "But it's time we were out of this."

"And don't you start fussing either, Mr Beaver," said his wife. "There. That's better.

There's five loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that's you, my dear," she added,looking at Lucy.

"Oh, do please come on," said Lucy.

"Well, I'm nearly ready now," answered Mrs Beaver at last, allowing her husband to helpher into; her snow-boots. "I suppose the sewing machine's took heavy to bring?"

"Yes. It is," said Mr Beaver. "A great deal too heavy. And you don't think you'll be ableto use it while we're on the run, I suppose?"

"I can't abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it," said Mrs Beaver, "and breakingit or stealing it, as likely as not."

"Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!" said the three children. And so at last they all gotoutside and Mr Beaver locked the door ("It'll delay her a bit," he said) and they set off, allcarrying their loads over their shoulders.

The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. Theywent in single file - first Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs Beaverlast of all. Mr Beaver led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river andthen along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank. Thesides of the valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above them on either hand.

"Best keep down here as much as possible," he said. "She'll have to keep to the top, foryou couldn't bring a sledge down here."

It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from acomfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they wenton walking and walking - and walking and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier andheavier, she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all. And she stoppedlooking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and atthe white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars andcould only watch the little short legs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad through thesnow in front of her as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared andthe snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almostasleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turnedaway from the river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the verythickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver was justvanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushesuntil you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she realized what was happening,only his short flat tail was showing.

Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises ofscrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them wereinside.

"Wherever is this?" said Peter's voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. (I hopeyou know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)

"It's an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times," said Mr Beaver, "and a great secret.

It's not much of a place but we must get a few hours' sleep."

"If you hadn't all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I'd have broughtsome pillows," said Mrs Beaver.

It wasn't nearly such a nice cave as Mr Tumnus's, Lucy thought - just a hole in the groundbut dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all abundle of clothes together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walkthey were really rather snug. If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! ThenMrs Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone dranksomething - it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat, but it also madeyou feel deliciously warm after you'd swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep.

It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hours later) whenshe woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like ahot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylightcoming in through the mouth of the cave. But immediately after that she was very wideawake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouthsand eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very sound they'd all beenthinking of (and sometimes imagining they heard) during their walk last night. It was asound of jingling bells.

Mr Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it. Perhaps you think, asLucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing to do? But it was really a verysensible one. He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes andbrambles without being seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way theWitch's sledge went. The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering. They waitednearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened them very much. Theyheard voices. "Oh," thought Lucy, "he's been seen. She's caught him!"

Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr Beaver's voice calling to themfrom just outside the cave.

"It's all right," he was shouting. "Come out, Mrs Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughtersof Adam. It's all right! It isn't Her!" This was bad grammar of course, but that is howbeavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia - in our world they usually don'ttalk at all.

So Mrs Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinking in thedaylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very frowsty and unbrushed anduncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.

"Come on!" cried Mr Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight. "Come and see! Thisis a nasty knock for the Witch! It looks as if her power is already crumbling."

"What do you mean, Mr Beaver?" panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank ofthe valley together.

"Didn't I tell you," answered Mr Beaver, "that she'd made it always winter and neverChristmas? Didn't I tell you? Well, just come and see!"

And then they were all at the top and did see.

It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they were far biggerthan the Witch's reindeer, and they were not white but brown. And on the sledge sat aperson whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him. He was a huge man. in abright red robe (bright as hollyberries) with a hood that had fur inside it and a great whitebeard, that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest.

Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you seepictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world - the world on this side ofthe wardrobe door. But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different. Some ofthe pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly. Butnow that the children actually stood looking at him they didn't find it quite like that. Hewas so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became quite still. They felt very glad,but also solemn.

"I've come at last," said he. "She has kept me out for a long time, but I have got in at last.

Aslan is on the move. The Witch's magic is weakening."

And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if youare being solemn and still.

"And now," said Father Christmas, "for your presents. There is a new and better sewingmachine for you, Mrs Beaver. I will drop it in your house as, I pass."

"If you please, sir," said Mrs Beaver, making a curtsey. "It's locked up."

"Locks and bolts make no difference to me," said Father Christmas. "And as for you, MrBeaver, when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaksstopped and a new sluicegate fitted."

Mr Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn'tsay anything at all.

"Peter, Adam's Son," said Father Christmas.

"Here, sir," said Peter.

"These are your presents," was the answer, "and they are tools not toys. The time to usethem is perhaps near at hand. Bear them well." With these words he handed to Peter ashield and a sword. The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a redlion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it. The hilt of the sword

was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was justthe right size and weight for Peter to use. Peter was silent and solemn as he received thesegifts, for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.

"Susan, Eve's Daughter," said Father Christmas. "These are for you," and he handed her abow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. "You must use the bow only ingreat need," he said, "for I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss.

And when you put this horn to your lips; and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think helpof some kind will come to you."

Last of all he said, "Lucy, Eve's Daughter," and Lucy came forward. He gave her a littlebottle of what looked like glass (but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond)and a small dagger. "In this bottle," he said, "there is cordial made of the juice of one ofthe fireflowers that grow in the mountains of the sun. If you or any of your friends is hurt,a few drops of this restore them. And the dagger is to defend yourse at great need. Foryou also are not to be in battle."

"Why, sir?" said Lucy. "I think - I don't know but I think I could be brave enough."

"That is not the point," he said. "But battles are ugly when women fight. And now" - herehe suddenly looked less grave - "here is something for the moment for you all!" and hebrought out (I suppose from the big bag at his back, but nobody quite saw him do it) alarge tray containing five cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and agreat big teapot all sizzling and piping hot. Then he cried out "Merry Christmas! Longlive the true King!" and cracked his whip, and he and the reindeer and the sledge and allwere out of sight before anyone realized that they had started.

Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr Beaver, whenMrs Beaver said:

"Now then, now then! Don't stand talking there till the tea's got cold. Just like men. Comeand help to carry the tray down and we'll have breakfast. What a mercy I thought ofbringing the bread-knife."

So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cut some of thebread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyedthemselves. But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said,"Time to be moving on now."
