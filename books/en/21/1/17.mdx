title: CHAPTER 17. THE HUNTING OF THE WHITE STAG
---

THE battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemy had beenkilled in the first charge of Aslan and his -companions; and when those who were stillliving saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves up or took to flight. Thenext thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands. It was strange toher to see Peter looking as he looked now - his face was so pale and stern and he seemedso much older.

"It was all Edmund's doing, Aslan," Peter was saying. "We'd have been beaten if it hadn'tbeen for him. The Witch was turning our troops into stone right and left. But nothingwould stop him. He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning oneof your leopards into a statue. And when he reached her he had sense to bring his swordsmashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply gettingmade a statue himself for his pains. That was the mistake all the rest were making. Onceher wand was broken we began to have some chance - if we hadn't lost so many already.

He was terribly wounded. We must go and see him."

They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from the fighting line. Hewas covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face a nasty green colour.

"Quick, Lucy," said Aslan.

And then, almost for the first time, Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had beengiven her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled so much that she could hardly

undo the stopper, but she managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her brother'smouth.

"There are other people wounded," said Aslan while she was still looking eagerly intoEdmund's pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result.

"Yes, I know," said Lucy crossly. "Wait a minute."

"Daughter of Eve," said Aslan in a graver voice, "others also are at the point of death.

Must more people die for Edmund?"

"I'm sorry, Aslan," said Lucy, getting up and going with him. And for the next half-hourthey were busy - she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had beenturned into stone. When at last she was free to come back to Edmund she found himstanding on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she hadseen him look - oh, for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school whichwas where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and couldlook you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a knight.

"Does he know," whispered Lucy to Susan, "what Aslan did for him? Does he know whatthe arrangement with the Witch really was?"

"Hush! No. Of course not," said Susan.

"Oughtn't he to be told?" said Lucy.

"Oh, surely not," said Susan. "It would be too awful for him. Think how you'd feel if youwere he."

"All the same I think he ought to know," said Lucy. But at that moment they wereinterrupted.

That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them all I don'tknow; but somehow or other they found themselves all sitting down on the grass to a finehigh tea at about eight o'clock. Next day they began marching eastward down the side ofthe great river. And the next day after that, at about teatime, they actually reached themouth. The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them; before themwere the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and seaweed, and the smell of thesea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever and ever on the beach. Andoh, the cry of the sea-gulls! Have you heard it? Can you remember?

That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again andget their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes. But next day wasmore solemn. For then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel - that wonderful hall with theivory roof and the west wall hung with peacock's feathers and the eastern door whichlooks towards the sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets,

Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them to the four thrones amid deafening shouts of,"Long Live King Peter! Long Live Queen Susan! Long Live King Edmund! Long LiveQueen Lucy!"

"Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam!

Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!" said Aslan.

And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of the mermen andthe mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in honour of their new Kings andQueens.

So the children sat on their thrones and sceptres were put into their hands and they gaverewards and honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, andGiant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs, and the good dwarfs, and tothe lion. And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing,and gold flashed and wine flowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger,sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.

But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kingsand Queens noticed that he wasn't there they said nothing about it. For Mr Beaver hadwarned them, "He'll be coming and going," he had said. "One day you'll see him andanother you won't. He doesn't like being tied down and of course he has other countries toattend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild,'you know. Not like a tame lion."

And now, as you see, this story is nearly (but not quite) at an end. These two Kings andtwo Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was their reign. At first much oftheir time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch's army anddestroying them, and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking inthe wilder parts of the forest - a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolfone month and a rumour of a hag the next. But in the end all that foul brood was stampedout. And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from beingunnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent toschool, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary peoplewho wanted to live and let live. And they drove back the fierce giants (quite a differentsort from Giant Rumblebuffin) on the north of Narnia when these ventured across thefrontier. And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea andpaid them visits of state and received visits of state from them. And they themselves grewand changed as the years passed over them. And Peter became a tall and deep-chestedman and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnificent. And Susan grewinto a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings ofthe countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage.

And she was called Susan the Gentle. Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter,and great in council and judgement. He was called King Edmund the Just. But as forLucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her tobe their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.

So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was onlyas one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus (who was a middle-agedFaun by now and beginning to be stout) came down river and brought them news that theWhite Stag had once more appeared in his parts - the White Stag who would give youwishes if you caught him. So these two Kings and two Queens with the principalmembers of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods tofollow the White Stag. And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him. Andhe led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin, till the horsesof all the courtiers were tired out and these four were still following. And they saw thestag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow. Then said King Peter (forthey talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and Queens for so long),"Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket;for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry."

"Sir," said the others, "even so let us do."

So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot.

And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,

"Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron."

"Madam," said,King Edmund, "if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of ironwith a lantern set on the top thereof."

"By the Lion's Mane, a strange device," said King Peter, "to set a lantern here where thetrees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light tono man!"

"Sir," said Queen Lucy. "By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here therewere smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a young wood and the ironpost is old." And they stood looking upon it. Then said King Edmund,

"I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely. It runs in mymind that I have seen the like before; as it were in a dream, or in the dream of a dream."

"Sir," answered they all, "it is even so with us also."

"And more," said Queen Lucy, "for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this postand lantern either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of ourfortunes."

"Madam," said King Edmund, "the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also."

"And in mine, fair brother," said King Peter.

"And in mine too," said Queen Susan. "Wherefore by my counsel we shall lightly returnto our horses and follow this White Stag no further."

"Madam," said King Peter, "therein I pray thee to have me excused. For never since wefour were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter, asbattles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice, and the like, and then given over; but alwayswhat we have taken in hand, the same we have achieved."

"Sister," said Queen Lucy, "my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems to me weshould be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following sonoble a beast as now we have in chase."

"And so say I," said King Edmund. "And I have such desire to find the signification ofthis thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narniaand all the islands."

"Then in the name of Aslan," said Queen Susan, "if ye will all have it so, let us go on andtake the adventure that shall fall to us."

So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before they had gone a score of pacesthey all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamppost, and before theyhad gone twenty more they noticed that they were. making their way not throughbranches but through coats. And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobedoor into the empty room, and They were no longer Kings and Queens in their huntingarray but just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes. It was the same dayand the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide. MrsMacready and the visitors were still talking in the passage; but luckily they never cameinto the empty room and so the children weren't caught.

And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn't been that they felt theyreally must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe weremissing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man, didn't tell them not to besilly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story. "No," he said, "I don't think it will beany good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats. You won't get intoNarnia again by that

route. Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did!

Eh? What's that? Yes, of course you'll get back to Narnia

again some day. Once a King in Narnia, always a King in

Narnia. But don't go trying to use the same route twice.

Indeed, don't try to get there at all. It'll happen when

you're not looking for it. And don't talk too much about it

even among yourselves. And don't mention it to anyone else

unless you find that they've

had adventures of the same sort themselves. What's that? How

will you know? Oh, you'll know all right. Odd things they

say - even their looks - will let the secret out. Keep your

eyes open. Bless me, what do they teach them at these

schools?

And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe.

But if the Professor was right it was only the beginning of

the adventures of Narnia.
