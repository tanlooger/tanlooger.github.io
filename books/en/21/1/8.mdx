title: CHAPTER 8. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DINNER
---

"AND now," said Lucy, "do please tell us what's happened to Mr Tumnus."

"Ah, that's bad," said Mr Beaver, shaking his head. "That's a very, very bad business.

There's no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done."

"But where's he been taken to?" asked Lucy.

"Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what thatmeans."

"No, we don't," said Susan. Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.

"I'm afraid it means they were taking him to her House," he said.

"But what'll they do to him, Mr Beaver?" gasped Lucy.

"Well," said Mr Beaver, "you can't exactly say for sure. But there's not many taken inthere that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is - in the courtyardand up the stairs and in the hall. People she's turned" - (he paused and shuddered) "turnedinto stone."

"But, Mr Beaver," said Lucy, "can't we - I mean we must do something to save him. It'stoo dreadful and it's all on my account."

"I don't doubt you'd save him if you could, dearie," said Mrs Beaver, "but you've nochance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive."

"Couldn't we have some stratagem?" said Peter. "I mean couldn't we dress up assomething, or pretend to be - oh, pedlars or anything - or watch till she was gone out - or-

oh, hang it all, there must be some way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, MrBeaver. We can't just leave him to be - to be - to have that done to him."

"It's no good, Son of Adam," said Mr Beaver, "no good your trying, of all people. Butnow that Aslan is on the move-"

"Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!" said several voices at once; for once again that strangefeeling - like the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.

"Who is Aslan?" asked Susan.

"Aslan?" said Mr Beaver. "Why, don't you know? He's the King. He's the Lord of thewhole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in my time or my father's time.

But the word has reached us that he has come back. He is in Narnia at this moment. He'llsettle the White Queen all right. It is he, not you, that will save Mr Tumnus."

"She won't turn him into stone too?" said Edmund.

"Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!" answered Mr Beaver with agreat laugh. "Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in theface it'll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He'll put all torights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:

Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,

At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,

When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,

And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.

You'll understand when you see him."

"But shall we see him?" asked Susan.

"Why, Daughter of Eve, that's what I brought you here for. I'm to lead you where youshall meet him," said Mr Beaver.

"Is-is he a man?" asked Lucy.

"Aslan a man!" said Mr Beaver sternly. "Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of thewood and the son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea. Don't you know who is the Kingof Beasts? Aslan is a lion - the Lion, the great Lion."

"Ooh!" said Susan, "I'd thought he was a man. Is he - quite safe? I shall feel rathernervous about meeting a lion."

"That you will, dearie, and no mistake," said Mrs Beaver; "if there's anyone who canappear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they're either braver than most or elsejust silly."

"Then he isn't safe?" said Lucy.

"Safe?" said Mr Beaver; "don't you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you? Who said anythingabout safe? 'Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I tell you."

"I'm longing to see him," said Peter, "even if I do feel frightened when it comes to thepoint."

"That's right, Son of Adam," said Mr Beaver, bringing his paw down on the table with acrash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. "And so you shall. Word has been sentthat you are to meet him, tomorrow if you can, at the Stone Table.'

"Where's that?" said Lucy.

"I'll show you," said Mr Beaver. "It's down the river, a good step from here. I'll take youto it!"

"But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus?" said Lucy.

"The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan," said Mr Beaver, "oncehe's with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we don't need you too. For that'sanother of the old rhymes:

When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

Sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

The evil time will be over and done.

So things must be drawing near their end now he's come and you've come. We've heardof Aslan coming into these parts before - long ago, nobody can say when. But there'snever been any of your race here before."

"That's what I don't understand, Mr Beaver," said Peter, "I mean isn't the Witch herselfhuman?"

"She'd like us to believe it," said Mr Beaver, "and it's on that that she bases her claim tobe Queen. But she's no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam's" - (here MrBeaver bowed) "your father Adam's first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one ofthe Jinn. That's what she comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of thegiants. No, no, there isn't a drop of real human blood in the Witch."

"That's why she's bad all through, Mr Beaver," said Mrs Beaver.

"True enough, Mrs Beaver," replied he, "there may be two views about humans (meaningno offence to the present company). But there's no two views about things that look likehumans and aren't."

"I've known good Dwarfs," said Mrs Beaver.

"So've I, now you come to speak of it," said her husband, "but precious few, and theywere the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anythingthat's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or oughtto be human and isn't, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that's whythe Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia. She's been watching foryou this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she'd be more dangerousstill."

"What's that to do with it?" asked Peter.

"Because of another prophecy," said Mr Beaver. "Down at Cair Paravel - that's the castleon the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of thewhole country if all was as it should be - down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones andit's a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughtersof Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch's reignbut of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knewabout you four, your lives wouldn't be worth a shake of my whiskers!"

All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was telling them that theyhad noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followedhis last remark, Lucy suddenly said:

"I say-where's Edmund?"

There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking "Who saw him last? Howlong has he been missing? Is he outside? and then all rushed to the door and looked out.

The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under athick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam youcould hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the softnew snow, and went round the house in every direction. "Edmund! Edmund!" they calledtill they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and therewas not even an echo in answer.

"How perfectly dreadful!" said Susan as they at last came back in despair. "Oh, how Iwish we'd never come."

"What on earth are we to do, Mr Beaver?" said Peter.

"Do?" said Mr Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots, "do? We must be offat once. We haven't a moment to spare!"

"We'd better divide into four search parties," said Peter, "and all go in differentdirections. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and-"

"Search parties, Son of Adam?" said Mr Beaver; "what for?"

"Why, to look for Edmund, of course!"

"There's no point in looking for him," said Mr Beaver.

"What do you mean?" said Susan. "He can't be far away yet. And we've got to find him.

What do you mean when you say there's no use looking for him?"

"The reason there's no use looking," said Mr Beaver, "is that we know already where he'sgone!" Everyone stared in amazement. "Don't you understand?" said Mr Beaver. "He'sgone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all."

"Oh, surely-oh, really!" said Susan, "he can't have done that."

"Can't he?" said Mr Beaver, looking very hard at the three children, and everything theywanted to say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this wasexactly what Edmund had done.

"But will he know the way?" said Peter.

"Has he been in this country before?" asked Mr Beaver. "Has he ever been here alone?"

"Yes," said Lucy, almost in a whisper. "I'm afraid he has."

"And did he tell you what he'd done or who he'd met?"

"Well, no, he didn't," said Lucy.

"Then mark my words," said Mr Beaver, "he has already met the White Witch and joinedher side, and been told where she lives. I didn't like to mention it before (he being yourbrother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself`Treacherous'. He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food.

You can always tell them if you've lived long in Narnia; something about their eyes."

"All the same," said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, "we'll still have to go andlook for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast. And he's only akid."

"Go to the Witch's House?" said Mrs Beaver. "Don't you see that the only chance ofsaving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?"

"How do you mean?" said Lucy.

"Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she's thinking all the time of those fourthrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done -

and there'd be four new statues in her collection before you'd had time to speak. But she'llkeep him alive as long as he's the only one she's got, because she'll want to use him as adecoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with."

"Oh, can no one help us?" wailed Lucy.

"Only Aslan," said Mr Beaver, "we must go on and meet him. That's our only chancenow."

"It seems to me, my dears," said Mrs Beaver, "that it is very important to know just whenhe slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance,had we started talking of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for shewon't know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quiteoff her guard as far as that is concerned."

"I don't remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan -" began Peter, butLucy interrupted him.

"Oh yes, he was," she said miserably; "don't you remember, it was he who asked whetherthe Witch couldn't turn Aslan into stone too?"

"So he did, by Jove," said Peter; "just the sort of thing he would say, too!"

"Worse and worse," said Mr Beaver, "and the next thing is this. Was he still here when Itold you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?"

And of course no one knew the answer to this question.

"Because, if he was," continued Mr Beaver, "then she'll simply sledge down in thatdirection and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In factwe shall be cut off from Aslan. "

"But that isn't what she'll do first," said Mrs Beaver, "not if I know her. The moment thatEdmund tells her that we're all here she'll set out to catch us this very night, and if he'sbeen gone about half an hour, she'll be here in about another twenty minutes."

"You're right, Mrs Beaver," said her husband, "we must all get away from here. There'snot a moment to lose."
