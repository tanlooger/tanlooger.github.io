title: CHAPTER 14. THE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCH
---

As soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said, "We must move from this place at once, itwill be wanted for other purposes. We shall encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna.

Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the witch;but his face was stern and everyone's ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar andso nobody dared.

After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top (for the sun had got strongby now and dried the grass), they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and

packing things up. Before two o'clock they were on the march and set off in anortheasterly direction, walking at an easy pace for they had not far to go.

During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign. "Assoon as she has finished her business in these parts," he said, "the Witch and her crewwill almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for a siege. You may or may notbe able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it." He then went on to outline twoplans of battle - one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another forassaulting her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct theoperations, saying things like, "You must put your Centaurs in such and such a place" or"You must post scouts to see that she doesn't do so-and-so," till at last Peter said,

"But you will be there yourself, Aslan."

"I can give you no promise of that," answered the Lion. And he continued giving Peterhis instructions.

For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him. He did nottalk very much and seemed to them to be sad.

It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widenedout and the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gaveorders to halt on this side of the water. But Peter said,

"Wouldn't it be better to camp on the far side - for fear she should try a night attack oranything?"

Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, roused himself with ashake of his magnificent mane and said, "Eh? What's that?" Peter said it all over again.

"No," said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn't matter. "No. She will not make an attackto-night." And then he sighed deeply. But presently he added, "All the same it was wellthought of. That is how a soldier ought to think. But it doesn't really matter." So theyproceeded to pitch their camp.

Aslan's mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at theidea of fighting the battle on his own; the news that Aslan might not be there had come asa great shock to him. Supper that evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different ithad been last night or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun,were already drawing to their end.

This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn't get to sleep when she went to bed.

And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give along sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness.

"Can't you get to sleep either?" said Susan.

"No," said Lucy. "I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!"

"What?"

"I've a most Horrible feeling - as if something were hanging over us."

"Have you? Because, as a matter of fact, so have I."

"Something about Aslan," said Lucy. "Either some dreadful thing is going to happen tohim, or something dreadful that he's going to do."

"There's been something wrong with him all afternoon," said Susan. "Lucy! What wasthat he said about not being with us at the battle? You don't think he could be stealingaway and leaving us tonight, do you?"

"Where is he now?" said Lucy. "Is he here in the pavilion?"

"I don't think so."

"Susan! let's go outside and have a look round. We might see him."

"All right. Let's," said Susan; "we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here."

Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of thetent. The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of theriver chattering over the stones. Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy's arm and said,"Look!" On the far side of the camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw theLion slowly walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followedhim.

He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the right -

apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from theHill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into dark shadows and out into palemoonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different fromthe Aslan they knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he werevery, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where there where noshadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It was no good trying to runaway so they came towards him. When they were closer he said,

"Oh, children, children, why are you following me?"

"We couldn't sleep," said Lucy - and then felt sure that she need say no more and thatAslan knew all they had been thinking.

"Please, may we come with you - wherever you're going?" asked Susan.

"Well -" said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he said, "I should be glad ofcompany tonight. Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when I tell you, andafter that leave me to go on alone."

"Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will," said the two girls.

Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion. But howslowly he walked! And his great, royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched thegrass. Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan.

"Aslan! Dear Aslan!" said Lucy, "what is wrong? Can't you tell us?"

"Are you ill, dear Aslan?" asked Susan.

"No," said Aslan. "I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel youare there and let us walk like that."

And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his permission, butwhat they had longed to do ever since they first saw him buried their cold hands in thebeautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so doing, walked with him. And presently theysaw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Tablestood. They went up at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got tothe last tree (it was one that had some bushes about it) Aslan stopped and said,

"Oh, children, children. Here you must stop. And whatever happens, do not let yourselvesbe seen. Farewell."

And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and clung to the Lion andkissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes. Then he turned fromthem and walked out on to the top of the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in thebushes, looked after him, and this is what they saw.

A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moonwas shining many of them carried torches which burned with evil-looking red flames andblack smoke. But such people! Ogres with monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headedmen; spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants; and other creatures whom I won't describebecause if I did the grownups would probably not let you read this book - Cruels andHags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins. Infact here were all those who were on the Witch's side and whom the Wolf had summonedat her command. And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.

A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they first saw the greatLion pacing towards them, and for a moment even the Witch seemed to be struck withfear. Then she recovered herself and gave a wild fierce laugh.

"The fool!" she cried. "The fool has come. Bind him fast."

Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan's roar and his spring upon hisenemies. But it never came. Four Hags, grinning and leering, yet also (at first) hangingback and half afraid of what they had to do, had approached him. "Bind him, I say!"repeated the White Witch. The Hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph whenthey found that he made no resistance at all. Then others - evil dwarfs and apes - rushedin to help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on his back and tied allhis four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave,though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all.

But he made no noise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords sotight that they cut into his flesh. Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table.

"Stop!" said the Witch. "Let him first be shaved."

Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with a pair ofshears came forward and squatted down by Aslan's head. Snip-snip-snip went the shearsand masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground. Then the ogre stood back and thechildren, watching from their hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all smalland different without its mane. The enemies also saw the difference.

"Why, he's only a great cat after all!" cried one.

"Is that what we were afraid of?" said another.

And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him, saying things like "Puss, Puss! Poor Pussy,"and "How many mice have you caught today, Cat?" and "Would you like a saucer ofmilk, Pussums?"

"Oh, how can they?" said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks. "The brutes, thebrutes!" for now that the first shock was over the shorn face of Aslan looked to herbraver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.

"Muzzle him!" said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his face putting onthe muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands. Buthe never moved. And this seemed to enrage all that rabble. Everyone was at him now.

Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find theircourage, and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him - so thickly was hesurrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him,jeering at him.

At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag the bound and muzzledLion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing. He was so huge that even whenthey got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him on to the surface of it. Then therewas more tying and tightening of cords.

"The cowards! The cowards!" sobbed Susan. "Are they still afraid of him, even now?"

When once Aslan had been tied (and tied so that he was really a mass of cords) on the flatstone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four torches, stood at the corners ofthe Table. The Witch bared her arms as she had bared them the previous night when ithad been Edmund instead of Aslan. Then she began to whet her knife. It looked to thechildren, when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone,not of steel, and it was of a strange and evil shape.

As last she drew near. She stood by Aslan's head. Her face was working and twitchingwith passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a littlesad. Then, just before she gave the blow, she stooped down and said in a quivering voice,

"And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you would save the humantraitor? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will beappeased. But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well? Andwho will take him out of my hand then? Understand that you have given me Narniaforever, you have lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that knowledge,despair and die."

The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn't bear to look andhad covered their eyes.
