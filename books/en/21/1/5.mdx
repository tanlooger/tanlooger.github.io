title: CHAPTER 5. BACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOOR
---

BECAUSE the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy sometime to find the others. But when at last they were all together (which happened in thelong room, where the suit of armour was) Lucy burst out:

"Peter! Susan! It's all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country you can get tothrough the wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one another in there, in thewood. Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it."

"What's all this about, Ed?" said Peter.

And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmundhad been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he hadn'tmade up his mind what to do. When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided allat once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of. He decided to letLucy down.

"Tell us, Ed," said Susan.

And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy (there was reallyonly a year's difference) and then a little snigger and said, "Oh, yes, Lucy and I have beenplaying - pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true. just for fun,of course. There's nothing there really."

Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.

Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored agreat success, and went on at once to say, "There she goes again. What's the matter withher? That's the worst of young kids, they always -"

"Look here," said Peter, turning on him savagely, "shut up! You've been perfectly beastlyto Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe, and now you go playinggames with her about it and setting her off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite."

"But it's all nonsense," said Edmund, very taken aback.

"Of course it's all nonsense," said Peter, "that's just the point. Lu was perfectly all rightwhen we left home, but since we've been down here she seems to be either going queer inthe head or else turning into a most frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do youthink you'll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?"

"I thought - I thought," said Edmund; but he couldn't think of anything to say.

"You didn't think anything at all," said Peter; "it's just spite. You've always liked beingbeastly to anyone smaller than yourself; we've seen that at school before now."

"Do stop it," said Susan; "it won't make things any better having a row between you two.

Let's go and find Lucy."

It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could seethat she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her made any difference. She stuck toher story and said:

"I don't care what you think, and I don't care what you say. You can tell the Professor oryou can write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I've met a Faun in thereand - I wish I'd stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts."

It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel thathis plan wasn't working as well as he had expected. The two older ones were reallybeginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind. They stood in the passage talking aboutit in whispers long after she had gone to bed.

The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the wholething to the Professor. "He'll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrongwith Lu," said Peter; "it's getting beyond us." So they went and knocked at the studydoor, and the Professor said "Come in," and got up and found chairs for them and said hewas quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fingerspressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the whole story. After thathe said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the last thingeither of them expected:

"How do you know," he asked, "that your sister's story is not true?"

"Oh, but -" began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man's facethat he was perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together and said, "But Edmundsaid they had only been pretending."

"That is a point," said the Professor, "which certainly deserves consideration; very carefulconsideration. For instance - if you will excuse me for asking the question - does yourexperience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean,which is the more truthful?"

"That's just the funny thing about it, sir," said Peter. "Up till now, I'd have said Lucyevery time."

"And what do you think, my dear?" said the Professor, turning to Susan.

"Well," said Susan, "in general, I'd say the same as Peter, but this couldn't be true - allthis about the wood and the Faun."

"That is more than I know," said the Professor, "and a charge of lying against someonewhom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thingindeed."

"We were afraid it mightn't even be lying," said Susan; "we thought there might besomething wrong with Lucy."

"Madness, you mean?" said the Professor quite coolly. "Oh, you can make your mindseasy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad."

"But then," said Susan, and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown-up would talklike the Professor and didn't know what to think.

"Logic!" said the Professor half to himself. "Why don't they teach logic at these schools?

There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she istelling the truth. You know she doesn't tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad Forthe moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she istelling the truth."

Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that hewas no making fun of them.

"But how could it be true, sir?" said Peter.

"Why do you say that?" asked the Professor.

"Well, for one thing," said Peter, "if it was true why doesn't everyone find this countryevery time they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing there when we looked;even Lucy didn't pretend the was."

"What has that to do with it?" said the Professor.

"Well, sir, if things are real, they're there all the time."

"Are they?" said the Professor; and Peter did'nt know quite what to say.

"But there was no time," said Susan. "Lucy had no time to have gone anywhere, even ifthere was such a place. She came running after us the very moment we were out of theroom. It was less than minute, and she pretended to have been away for hours."

"That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true," said the Professor. "Ifthere really a door in this house that leads to some other world (and I should warn youthat this is a very strange house, and even I know very little about it) - if, I say, she hadgot into another world, I should not be at a surprised to find that the other world had aseparate time of its own; so that however long you stay there it would never take up anyof our time. On the other hand, I don't think many girls of her age would invent that ideafor themselves. If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable timebefore coming out and telling her story."

"But do you really mean, sir," said Peter, "that there could be other worlds - all over theplace, just round the corner - like that?"

"Nothing is more probable," said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning topolish them, while he muttered to himself, "I wonder what they do teach them at theseschools."

"But what are we to do?" said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to getoff the point.

"My dear young lady," said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharpexpression at both of them, "there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and whichis well worth trying."

"What's that?" said Susan.

"We might all try minding our own business," said he. And that was the end of thatconversation.

After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stoppedjeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe atall. It had become a rather alarming subject. And so for a time it looked as if all theadventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be.

This house of the Professor's - which even he knew so little about - was so old andfamous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it.

It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories; and well itmight be, for all manner of stories were told about it, some of them even stranger than theone I am telling you now. And when parties of sightseers arrived and asked to see thehouse, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs Macready, the housekeeper,showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and the rare books inthe library. Mrs Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be interruptedwhen she was telling visitors all the things she knew. She had said to Susan and Peteralmost on the first morning (along with a good many other instructions), "And pleaseremember you're to keep out of the way whenever I'm taking a party over the house."

"Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd ofstrange grown-ups!" said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was howthe adventures began for the second time.

A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour andwondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said,"Look out! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her."

"Sharp's the word," said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of theroom. But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the Library,they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and realized that Mrs Macready must bebringing her party of sightseers up the back stairs - instead of up the front stairs as theyhad expected. And after that - whether it was that they lost their heads, or that MrsMacready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life andwas chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followedeverywhere, until at last Susan said, "Oh bother those trippers! Here - let's get into the

Wardrobe Room till they've passed. No one will follow us in there." But the moment theywere inside they heard the voices in the passage - and then someone fumbling at the door- and then they saw the handle turning.

"Quick!" said Peter, "there's nowhere else," and flung open the wardrobe. All four ofthem bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter held the door closed butdid not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that youshould never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.
