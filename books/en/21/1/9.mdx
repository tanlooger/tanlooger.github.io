title: CHAPTER 9. IN THE WITCH'S HOUSE
---

AND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten hisshare of the dinner, but he hadn't really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the timeabout Turkish Delight - and there's nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food halfso much as the memory of bad magic food. And he had heard the conversation, andhadn't enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were taking nonotice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder. They weren't, but he imagined it.

And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heardthe whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he beganvery quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention

of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others amysterious and lovely feeling.

Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam's flesh and Adam's boneEdmund had been very quietly turning the doorhandle; and just before Mr Beaver hadbegun telling them that the White Witch wasn't really human at all but half a Jinn andhalf a giantess, Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the doorbehind him.

You mustn't think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted hisbrother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince(and later a King) and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast. As for what the Witchwould do with the others, he didn't want her to be particularly nice to them - certainly notto put them on the same level as himself; but he managed to believe, or to pretend hebelieved, that she wouldn't do anything very bad to them, "Because," he said to himself,"all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of itisn't true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she is therightful Queen really. Anyway, she'll be better than that awful Aslan!" At least, that wasthe excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn't a very good excuse,however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad andcruel.

The first thing he realized when he got outside and found the snow falling all round him,was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers' house. And of course there was nochance of going back to get it now. The next thing he realized was that the daylight wasalmost gone, for it had been nearly three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and thewinter days were short. He hadn't reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. Sohe turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn't so slipperysince the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.

It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute andwhat with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feetahead. And then too there was no road. He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, andskidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steepbanks, and barking his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over.

The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really think he might have given upthe whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others, if hehadn't happened to say to himself, "When I'm King of Narnia the first thing I shall do willbe to make some decent roads." And of course that set him off thinking about being aKing and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He hadjust settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and allabout his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws hewould make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing touches to someschemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather changed. First the snowstopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled

away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it madeeverything almost as bright as day - only the shadows were rather confusing.

He would never have found his way if the moon hadn't come out by the time he got to theother river you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at the Beavers') a smallerriver flowing into the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow itup. But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one hehad just left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it at allin the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop under branches andgreat loads of snow came sliding off on to his back. And every time this happened hethought more and more how he hated Peter - just as if all this had been Peter's fault.

But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. Andthere, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plainbetween two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch's House. And the moon wasshining brighter than ever. The House was really a small castle. It seemed to be alltowers; little towers with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles. They looked likehuge dunce's caps or sorcerer's caps. And they shone in the moonlight and their longshadows looked strange on the snow. Edmund began to be afraid of the House.

But it was too late to think of turning back now.

He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House. There was nothing stirring;not the slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newlyfallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the House, and past turretafter turret to find the door. He had to go right round to the far side before he found it. Itwas a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open.

Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw asight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlightshining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmundstood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his kneesknocking together. He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering withcold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don'tknow, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.

Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still - for it hadn't movedone inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping inthe shadow of the arch as much as he could. He now saw from the way the lion wasstanding that it couldn't have been looking at him at all. ("But supposing it turns itshead?" thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring at something else namely a little: dwarfwho stood with his back to it about four feet away. "Aha!" thought Edmund. "When itsprings at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape." But still the lion never moved,nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said aboutthe White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And assoon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion's back and the top of its head were

covered with snow. Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have letitself get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it wouldburst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now he hardly dared to touch it, but atlast he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It was cold stone. He had been frightenedof a mere statue!

The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warmall over right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head whatseemed a perfectly lovely idea. "Probably," he thought, "this is the great Lion Aslan thatthey were all talking about. She's caught him already and turned him into stone. So that'sthe end of all their fine ideas about him! Pooh! Who's afraid of Aslan?"

And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very sillyand childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustacheon the lion's upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, "Yah! Sillyold Aslan! How do you like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn'tyou?" But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked soterrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight, that Edmund didn't really get anyfun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.

As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about -

standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board when it is half-waythrough the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes andcat-amountains of stone. There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but whowere really the spirits of trees. There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horseand a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon. They all looked so strangestanding there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in the bright cold moonlight, thatit was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape likea man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in itsright hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one,Edmund did not like going past it.

He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of thecourtyard. He went to it; there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door.

Edmund went up them. Across the threshold lay a great wolf.

"It's all right, it's all right," he kept saying to himself; "it's only a stone wolf. It can't hurtme", and he raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hairbristling along its back, opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice:

"Who's there? Who's there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are."

"If you please, sir," said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak, "my name isEdmund, and I'm the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day andI've come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia - quiteclose, in the Beavers' house. She - she wanted to see them."

"I will tell Her Majesty," said the Wolf. "Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as youvalue your life." Then it vanished into the house.

Edmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heart pounding in hischest, and presently the grey wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of the Witch's Secret Police, camebounding back and said, "Come in! Come in! Fortunate favourite of the Queen - or elsenot so fortunate."

And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf's paws.

He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the courtyard had been,of statues. The one nearest the door was a little faun with a very sad expression on itsface, and Edmund couldn't help wondering if this might be Lucy's friend. The only lightcame from a single lamp and close beside this sat the White Witch.

"I'm come, your Majesty," said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.

"How dare you come alone?" said the Witch in a terrible voice. "Did I not tell you tobring the others with you?"

"Please, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I've done the best I can. I've brought them quiteclose. They're in the little house on top of the dam just up the riverwith Mr and MrsBeaver."

A slow cruel smile came over the Witch's face.

"Is this all your news?" she asked.

"No, your Majesty," said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heard beforeleaving the Beavers' house.

"What! Aslan?" cried the Queen, "Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have lied to me -"

"Please, I'm only repeating what they said," stammered Edmund.

But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands. Instantly thesame dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.

"Make ready our sledge," ordered the Witch, "and use the harness without bells."
