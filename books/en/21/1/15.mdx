title: CHAPTER 15. DEEPER MAGIC FROM BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME
---

WHILE the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces, theyheard the voice of the Witch calling out,

"Now! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war! It will not take uslong to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool, the great Cat,lies dead."

At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. For with wildcries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the whole of that vile rabblecame sweeping off the hill-top and down the slope right past their hiding-place. They feltthe Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath themunder the galloping feet of the Minotaurs; and overhead there went a flurry of foul wingsand a blackness of vultures and giant bats. At any other time they would have trembledwith fear; but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan's death so filled theirminds that they hardly thought of it.

As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto the open hill-top.

The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her, but still they couldsee the shape of the Lion lying dead in his bonds. And down they both knelt in the wetgrass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur - what was left of it - and criedtill they could cry no more. And then they looked at each other and held each other'shands for mere loneliness and cried again; and then again were silent. At last Lucy said,

"I can't bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder could we take if off?"

So they tried. And after a lot of working at it (for their fingers were cold and it was nowthe darkest part of the night) they succeeded. And when they saw his face without it theyburst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and thefoam as well as they could. And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than Iknow how to describe.

"I wonder could we untie him as well?" said Susan presently. But the enemies, out ofpure spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of theknots.

I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy werethat night; but if you have been - if you've been up all night and cried till you have nomore tears left in you - you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. Youfeel as if nothing was ever going to happen again. At any rate that was how it felt to thesetwo. Hours and hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed thatthey were getting colder and colder. But at last Lucy noticed two other things. One wasthat the sky on the east side of the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago.

The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her feet. At first she took nointerest in this. What did it matter? Nothing mattered now! But at last she saw thatwhatever-it-was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table. And nowwhatever-they-were were moving about on Aslan's body. She peered closer. They werelittle grey things.

"Ugh!" said Susan from the other side of the Table. "How beastly! There are horrid littlemice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts." And she raised her hand to frightenthem away.

"Wait!" said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still. "Can you see whatthey're doing?"

Both girls bent down and stared.

"I do believe -" said Susan. "But how queer! They're nibbling away at the cords!"

"That's what I thought," said Lucy. "I think they're friendly mice. Poor little things - theydon't realize he's dead. They think it'll do some good untying him."

It was quite definitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the first time the whiteface of the other. They could see the mice nibbling away; dozens and dozens, evenhundreds, of little field mice. And at last, one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.

The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter - all except onevery big one low down on the eastern horizon. They felt colder than they had been allnight. The mice crept away again.

The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked more like himselfwithout them. Every moment his dead face looked nobler, as the light grew and theycould see it better.

In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so still for hours andhours that it startled them. Then another bird answered it. Soon there were birds singingall over the place.

It was quite definitely early morning now, not late night.

"I'm so cold," said Lucy.

"So am I," said Susan. "Let's walk about a bit."

They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one big star had almostdisappeared. The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at the very end of the world,the sea showed pale. The sky began to turn red. They walked to ands fro more times thanthey could count between the dead Aslan and the eastern ridge, trying to keep warm; andoh, how tired their legs felt. Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out towardsthey sea and Cair Paravel (which they could now just make out) the red turned to goldalong the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun.

At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise - a great cracking, deafeningnoise as if a giant had broken a giant's plate.

"What's that?" said Lucy, clutching Susan's arm.

"I - I feel afraid to turn round," said Susan; "something awful is happening."

"They're doing something worse to Him," said Lucy. "Come on!" And she turned, pullingSusan round with her.

The rising of the sun had made everything look so different - all colours and shadowswere changed that for a moment they didn't see the important thing. Then they did. TheStone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end;and there was no Aslan.

"Oh, oh, oh!" cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.

"Oh, it's too bad," sobbed Lucy; "they might have left the body alone."

"Who's done it?" cried Susan. "What does it mean? Is it magic?"

"Yes!" said a great voice behind their backs. "It is more magic." They looked round.

There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane (forit had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.

"Oh, Aslan!" cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much frightened as theywere glad.

"Aren't you dead then, dear Aslan?" said Lucy.

"Not now," said Aslan.

"You're not - not a - ?" asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn't bring herself to say theword ghost. Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead. The warmth of hisbreath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.

"Do I look it?" he said.

"Oh, you're real, you're real! Oh, Aslan!" cried Lucy, and both girls flung themselvesupon him and covered him with kisses.

"But what does it all mean?" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.

"It means," said Aslan, "that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magicdeeper still which she did not know: Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time.

But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darknessbefore Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would haveknown that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in atraitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards.

And now -"

"Oh yes. Now?" said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her hands.

"Oh, children," said the Lion, "I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh, children, catchme if you can!" He stood for a second, his eyes very bright, his limbs quivering, lashinghimself with his tail. Then he made a leap high over their heads and landed on the otherside of the Table. Laughing, though she didn't know why, Lucy scrambled over it toreach him. Aslan leaped again. A mad chase began. Round and round the hill-top he ledthem, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost catch his tail, nowdiving between them, now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velvetedpaws and catching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of themrolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs. It was such aromp as no one has ever had except in Narnia; and whether it was more like playing with

a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind. And thefunny thing was that when all three finally lay together panting in the sun the girls nolonger felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.

"And now," said Aslan presently, "to business. I feel I am going to roar. You had betterput your fingers in your ears."

And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face becameso terrible that they did not dare to look at it. And they saw all the trees in front of himbend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind. Then hesaid,

"We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me." And he crouched down and thechildren climbed on to his warm, golden back, and Susan sat first, holding on tightly tohis mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan. And with a great heave he roseunderneath them and then shot off, faster than any horse could go, down hill and into thethick of the forest.

That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Haveyou ever had a gallop on a horse? Think of that; and then take away the heavy noise ofthe hoofs and the jingle of the bits and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding ofthe great paws. Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horsethe soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane flying back in the wind. And then imagineyou are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse. But this is a mount that doesn'tneed to be guided and never grows tired. He rushes on and on, never missing his footing,never hesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping overbush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all.

And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right acrossNarnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunny glades of oak,through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossyrocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes, and across theshoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down, down, down againinto wild valleys and out into acres of blue flowers.

It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at acastle - a little toy castle it looked from where they stood - which seemed to be all pointedtowers. But the Lion was rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every momentand before they had time even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a levelwith it. And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them.

No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut. And Aslan, not at allslacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.

"The Witch's home!" he cried. "Now, children, hold tight."

Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the children felt as ifthey had left their insides behind them; for the Lion had gathered himself together for a

greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped - or you may call it flying rather thanjumping - right over the castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, foundthemselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.
