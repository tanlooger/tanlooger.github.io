title: CHAPTER 7. ARAVIS IN TASHBAAN
---

WHAT had really happened was this. When Aravis saw Shasta hurried away by theNarnians and found herself alone with two horses who (very wisely) wouldn't say a word,she never lost her head even for a moment. She grabbed Bree's halter and stood still,holding both the horses; and though her heart was beating as hard as a hammer, she didnothing to show it. As soon as the Narnian lords had passed she tried to move on again.

But before she could take a step, another crier ("Bother all these people" thought Aravis)was heard shouting out, "Way, way, way! Way for the Tarkheena Lasaraleen!" andimmediately, following the crier, came four armed slaves and then four bearers carrying alitter which was all a-flutter with silken curtains and all a-jingle with silver bells andwhich scented the whole street with perfumes and flowers. After the litter, female slavesin beautiful clothes, and then a few grooms, runners, pages, and the like. And now Aravismade her first mistake.

She knew Lasaraleen quite well - almost as if they had been at school together - becausethey had often stayed in the same houses and been to the same parties. And Araviscouldn't help looking up to see what Lasaraleen looked like now that she was married anda very great person indeed.

It was fatal. The eyes of the two girls met. And immediately Lasaraleen sat up in the litterand burst out at the top of her voice.

"Aravis! What on earth are you doing here? Your father-"

There was not a moment to lose. Without a second's delay Aravis let go the Horses,caught the edge of the litter, swung herself up beside Lasaraleen and whispered furiouslyin her ear.

"Shut up! Do you hear! Shut up. You must hide me. Tell your people-"

"But darling-" began Lasaraleen in the same loud voice. (She didn't in the least mindmaking people stare; in fact she rather liked it.)

"Do what I tell you or I'll never speak to you again," hissed Aravis. "Please, please bequick, Las. It's frightfully important. Tell your people to bring those two horses along.

Pull all the curtains of the litter and get away somewhere where I can't be found. And dohurry."

"All right, darling," said Lasaraleen in her lazy voice. "Here. Two of you take theTarkheena's horses." (This was to the slaves.) "And now home. I say, darling, do youthink we really want the curtains drawn on a day like this? I mean to say-"

But Aravis had already drawn the curtains, enclosing Lasaraleen and herself in a rich andscented, but rather stuffy, kind of tent.

"I mustn't be seen," "she said. "My father doesn't know I'm here. I'm running away."

"My dear, how perfectly thrilling," said Lasaraleen. "I'm dying to hear all about it.

Darling, you're sitting on my dress. Do you mind? That's better. It is a new one. Do youlike it? I got it at-"

"Oh, Las, do be serious," said Aravis. "Where is my father?"

"Didn't you know?" said Lasaraleen. "He's here, of course. He came to town yesterdayand is asking about you everywhere. And to think of you and me being here together andhis not knowing anything about it! It's the funniest thing I ever heard." And she went offinto giggles. She always had been a terrible giggler, as Aravis now remembered.

"It isn't funny at all," she said. "It's dreadfully serious. Where can you hide me?"

"No difficulty at all, my dear girl," said Lasaraleen. "I'll take you home. My husband'saway and no one will see you. Phew! It's not much fun with the curtains drawn. I want tosee people. There's no point in having a new dress on if one's to go about shut up likethis."

"I hope no one heard you when you shouted out to me like that," said Aravis.

"No, no, of course, darling," said Lasaraleen absentmindedly. "But you haven't even toldme yet what you think of the dress."

"Another thing," said Aravis. "You must tell your people to treat those two horses veryrespectfully. That's part of the secret. They're really Talking Horses from Narnia."

"Fancy!" said Lasaraleen. "How exciting! And oh, darling, have you seen the barbarianqueen from Narnia? She's staying in Tashbaan at present. They say Prince Rabadash ismadly in love with her. There have been the most wonderful parties and hunts and thingsall this last fortnight. I can't see that she's so very pretty myself. But some of the Narnianmen are lovely. I was taken out on a river party the day before yesterday, and I waswearing my-"

"How shall we prevent your people telling everyone that you've got a visitor - dressedlike a beggar's brat - in your house? It might so easily get round to my father."

"Now don't keep on fussing, there's a dear," said Lasaraleen. "We'll get you some properclothes in a moment. And here we are!"

The bearers had stopped and the litter was being lowered. When the curtains had beendrawn Aravis found that she was in a courtyard-garden very like the one that Shasta hadbeen taken into a few minutes earlier in another part of the city. Lasaraleen would havegone indoors at once but Aravis reminded her in a frantic whisper to say something to theslaves about not telling anyone of their mistress's strange visitor.

"Sorry, darling, it had gone right out of my head," said Lasareleen. "Here. All of you.

And you, doorkeeper. No one is to be let out of the house today. And anyone I catchtalking about this young lady will be first beaten to death and then burned alive and afterthat be kept on bread and water for six weeks. There."

Although Lasaraleen had said she was dying to hear Aravis's story, she showed no sign ofreally wanting to hear it at all. She was, in fact, much better at talking than at listening.

She insisted on Aravis having a long and luxurious bath (Calormene baths are famous)and then dressing her up in the finest clothes before she would let her explain anything.

The fuss she made about choosing the dresses nearly drove Aravis mad. She rememberednow that Lasaraleen had always been like that, interested in clothes and parties andgossip. Aravis had always been more interested in bows and arrows and horses and dogsand swimming. You will guess that each thought the other silly. But when at last theywere both seated after a meal (it was chiefly of the whipped cream and jelly and fruit andice sort) in a beautiful pillared room (which Aravis would have liked better ifLasaraleen's spoiled pet monkey hadn't been climbing about it all the time) Lasaraleen atlast asked her why she was running away from home.

When Aravis had finished telling her story, Lasaraleen said, "But, darling, why don't youmarry Ahoshta Tarkaan? Everyone's crazy about him. My husband says he is beginningto be one of the greatest men in Calormen. He has just been made Grand Vizier now oldAxartha has died. Didn't you know?"

"I don't care. I can't stand the sight of him," said Aravis.

"But, darling, only think! Three palaces, and one of them that beautiful one down on thelake at Ilkeen. Positively ropes of pearls, I'm told. Baths of asses' milk. And you'd seesuch a lot of me."

"He can keep his pearls and palaces as far as I'm concerned," said Aravis.

"You always were a queer girl, Aravis," said Lasaraleen. "What more do you want?"

In the end, however, Aravis managed to make her friend believe that she was in earnestand even to discuss plans. There would be no difficulty now about getting the two horsesout of the North gate and then on to the Tombs. No one would stop or question a groomin fine clothes leading a war horse and a lady's saddle horse down to the river, andLasaraleen had plenty of grooms to send. It wasn't so easy to decide what to do aboutAravis herself. She suggested that she could be carried out in the litter with the curtainsdrawn. But Lasaraleen told her that litters were only used in the city and the sight of onegoing out through the gate would be certain to lead to questions.

When they had talked for a long time - and it was all the longer because Aravis found ithard to keep her friend to the point-at last Lasaraleen clapped her hands and said, "Oh, Ihave an idea. There is one way of getting out of the city without using the gates. TheTisroc's garden (may he live for ever!) runs right down to the water and there is a littlewater-door. Only for the palace people of course - but then you know, dear (here shetittered a little) we almost are palace people. I say, it is lucky for you that you came tome. The dear Tisroc (may he live for ever!) is so kind. We're asked to the palace almostevery day and it is like a second home. I love all the dear princes and princesses and Ipositively adore Prince Rabadash. I might run in and see any of the palace ladies at anyhour of the day or night. Why shouldn't I slip in withyou, after dark, and let you out bythe water-door? There are always a few punts and things tied up outside it. And even ifwe were caught-"

"All would be lost," said Aravis.

"Oh darling, don't get so excited," said Lasaraleen. "I was going to say, even if we werecaught everyone would only say it was one of my mad jokes. I'm getting quite wellknown for them. Only the other day- do listen, dear, this is frightfully funny-"

"I meant, all would be lost for me," said Aravis a little sharply.

"Oh - ah - yes - I do see what you mean, darling. Well, can you think of any better plan?"

Aravis couldn't, and answered, "No. We'll have to risk it. When can we start?"

"Oh, not tonight," said Lasaraleen. "Of course not tonight. There's a great feast on tonight(I must start getting my hair done for it in a few minutes) and the whole place will be ablaze of lights. And such a crowd too! It would have to be tomorrow night."

This was bad news for Aravis, but she had to make the best of it. The afternoon passedvery slowly and it was a relief when Lasaraleen went out to the banquet, for Aravis wasvery tired of her giggling and her talk about dresses and parties, weddings andengagements and scandals. She went to bed early and that part she did enjoy: it was sonice to have pillows and sheets again.

But the next day passed very slowly. Lasaraleen wanted to go back on the wholearrangement and kept on telling Aravis that Narnia was a country of perpetual snow andice inhabited by demons and sorcerers, and she was mad to think of going there. "Andwith a peasant boy, too!" said Lasaraleen. "Darling, think of it! It's not Nice." Aravis hadthought of it a good deal, but she was so tired of Lasaraleen's silliness by now that, forthe first time, she began to think that travelling with Shasta was really rather more funthan fashionable life in Tashbaan. So she only replied, "You forget that I'll be nobody,just like him, when we get to Narnia. And anyway, I promised."

"And to think," said Lasaraleen, almost crying, "that if only you had sense you could bethe wife of a Grand Vizier!" Aravis went away to have a private word with the horses.

"You must go with a groom a little before sunset down to the Tombs," she said. "Nomore of those packs. You'll be saddled and bridled again. But there'll have to be food inHwin's saddle-bags and a full water-skin behind yours, Bree. The man has orders to letyou both have a good long drink at the far side of the bridge."

"And then, Narnia and the North!" whispered Bree. "But what if Shasta is not at theTombs."

"Wait for him of course," said Aravis. "I hope you've been quite comfortable."

"Never better stabled in my life," said Bree. "But if the husband of that titteringTarkheena friend of yours is paying his head groom to get the best oats, then I think thehead groom is cheating him."

Aravis and Lasaraleen had supper in the pillared room.

About two hours later they were ready to start. Aravis was dressed to look like a superiorslave-girl in a great house and wore a veil over her face. They had agreed that if anyquestions were asked Lasaraleen would pretend that Aravis was a slave she was taking asa present to one of the princesses.

The two girls went out on foot. A very few minutes brought them to the palace gates.

Here there were of course soldiers on guard but the officer knew Lasaraleen quite welland called his men to attention and saluted. They passed at once into the Hall of BlackMarble. A fair number of courtiers, slaves and others were still moving about here butthis only made the two girls less conspicuous. They passed on into the Hall of Pillars andthen into the Hall of Statues and down the colonnade, passing the great beatencopper

doors of the throne room. It was all magnificent beyond description; what they could seeof it in the dim light of the lamps.

Presently they came out into the garden-court which sloped downhill in a number ofterraces. On the far side of that they came to the Old Palace. It had already grown almostquite dark and they now found themselves in a maze of corridors lit only by occasionaltorches fixed in brackets to the walls. Lasaraleen halted at a place where you had to goeither left or right.

"Go on, do go on," whispered Aravis, whose heart was beating terribly and who still feltthat her father might run into them at any corner.

"I'm just wondering..." said Lasaraleen. "I'm not absolutely sure which way we go fromhere. I think it's the left. Yes, I'm almost sure it's the left. What fun this is!"

They took the left hand way and found themselves in a passage that was hardly lighted atall and which soon began going down steps.

"It's all right," said Lasaraleen. "I'm sure we're right now. I remember these steps." But atthat moment a moving light appeared ahead. A second later there appeared from round adistant corner, the dark shapes of two men walking backwards and carrying tall candles.

And of course it is only before royalties that people walk backwards. Aravis feltLasaraleen grip her arm - that sort of sudden grip which is almost a pinch and whichmeans that the person who is gripping you is very frightened indeed. Aravis thought itodd that Lasaraleen should be so afraid of the Tisroc if he were really such a friend ofhers, but there was no time to go on thinking. Lasaraleen was hurrying her back to the topof the steps, on tiptoes, and groping wildly along the wall.

"Here's a door," she whispered. "Quick."

They went in, drew the door very softly behind them, and found themselves in pitchdarkness. Aravis could hear by Lasaraleen's breathing that she was terrified.

"Tash preserve us!" whispered Lasaraleen. "What shall we do if he comes in here. Canwe hide?"

There was a soft carpet under their feet. They groped forward into the room andblundered on to a sofa.

"Let's lie down behind it," whimpered Lasaraleen. "Oh, I do wish we hadn't come."

There was just room between the sofa and the curtained wall and the two girls got down.

Lasaraleen managed to get the better position and was completely covered. The upperpart of Aravis's face stuck out beyond the sofa, so that if anyone came into that room witha light and happened to look in exactly the right place they would see her. But of course,because she was wearing a veil, what they saw would not at once look like a forehead and

a pair of eyes. Aravis shoved desperately to try to make Lasaraleen give her a little moreroom. But Lasaraleen, now quite selfish in her panic, fought back and pinched her feet.

They gave it up and lay still, panting a little. Their own breath semed dreadfully noisy,but there was no other noise.

"Is it safe?" said Aravis at last in the tiniest possible whisper.

"I - I - think so," began Lasaraleen. "But my poor nerves -" and then came the mostterrible noise they could have heard at that moment: the noise of the door opening. Andthen came light. And because Aravis couldn't get her head any further in behind the sofa,she saw everything.

First came the two slaves (deaf and dumb, as Aravis rightly guessed, and therefore usedat the most secret councils) walking backwards and carrying the candles. They took uptheir stand one at each end of the sofa. This was a good thing, for of course it was nowharder for anyone to see Aravis once a slave was in front of her and she was lookingbetween his heels. Then came an old man, very fat, wearing a curious pointed cap bywhich she immediately knew that he was the Tisroc. The least of the jewels with whichhe was covered was worth more than all the clothes and weapons of the Narnian lords puttogether: but he was so fat and such a mass of frills and pleats and bobbles and buttonsand tassels and talismans that Aravis couldn't help thinking the Narnian fashions (at anyrate for men) looked nicer. After him came a tall young man with a feathered andjewelled turban on his head and an ivory-sheathed scimitar at his side. He seemed veryexcited and his eyes and teeth flashed fiercely in the candlelight. Last of all came a littlehump-backed, wizened old man in whom she recognized with a shudder the new GrandVizier and her own betrothed husband, Ahoshta Tarkaan himself.

As soon as all three had entered the room and the door was shut, the Tisroc seatedhimself on the divan with a sigh of contentment, the young man took his place, standingbefore him, and the Grand Vizier got down on his knees and elbows and laid his face flaton the carpet.
