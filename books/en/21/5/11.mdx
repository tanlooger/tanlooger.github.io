title: CHAPTER 11. THE UNWELCOME FELLOW TRAVELLER
---

WHEN Shasta went through the gate he found a slope of grass and a little heatherrunning up before him to some trees. He had nothing to think about now and no plans tomake: he had only to run, and that was quite enough. His limbs were shaking, a terriblestitch was beginning in his side, and the sweat that kept dropping into his eyes blindedthem and made them smart. He was unsteady on his feet too, and more than once henearly turned his ankle on a loose stone.

The trees were thicker now than they had yet been and in the more open spaces there wasbracken. The sun had gone in without making it any cooler. It had become one of thosehot, grey days when there seem to be twice as many flies as usual. Shasta's face wascovered with them; he didn't even try to shake them off - he had too much else to do.

Suddenly he heard a horn - not a great throbbing horn like the horns of Tashbaan but amerry call, Ti-ro-to-to-ho! Next moment he came out into a wide glade and found himselfin a crowd of people.

At least, it looked a crowd to him. In reality there were about fifteen or twenty of them,all gentlemen in green huntingdress, with their horses; some in the saddle and somestanding by their horses' heads. In the centre someone was holding the stirrup for a manto mount. And the man he was holding it for was the jolliest, fat, applecheeked, twinklingeyed King you could imagine.

As soon as Shasta came in sight this King forgot all about mounting his horse. He spreadout his arms to Shasta, his face lit up, and he cried out in a great, deep voice that seemedto come from the bottom of his chest:

"Corin! My son! And on foot, and in rags! What-"

"No," panted Shasta, shaking his head. "Not Prince Corin. I - I - know I'm like him... sawhis Highness in Tashbaan... sent his greetings."

The King was staring at Shasta with an extraordinary expression on his face.

"Are you K-King Lune?" gasped Shasta. And then, without waiting for an answer, "LordKing - fly - Anvard shut the gates - enemies upon you - Rabadash and two hundredhorse."

"Have you assurance of this, boy?" asked one of the other gentlemen.

"My own eyes," said Shasta. "I've seen them. Raced them all the way from Tashbaan."

"On foot?" said the gentleman, raising his eyebrows a little.

Horses-with the Hermit," said Shasta.

"Question him no more; Darrin," said King Lune. "I see truth in his face. We must ridefor it, gentlemen. A spare horse there, for the boy. You can ride fast, friend?"

For answer Shasta put his foot in the stirrup of the horse which had been led towards himand a moment later he was in the saddle. He had done it a hundred times with Bree in thelast few weeks, and his mounting was very different now from what it had been on thatfirst night when Bree had said that he climbed up a horse as if he were climbing ahaystack.

He was pleased to hear the Lord Darrin say to the King, "The boy has a true horseman'sseat, Sire. I'll warrant there's noble blood in him."

"His blood, aye, there's the point," said the King. And he stared hard at Shasta again withthat curious expression, almost a hungry expression, in his steady, grey eyes.

But by now -the whole party was moving off at a brisk canter. Shasta's seat was excellentbut he was sadly puzzled what to do with his reins, for he had never touched the reinswhile he was on Bree's back. But he looked very carefully out of the corners of his eyesto see what the others were doing (as some of us have done at parties when we weren'tquite sure which knife or fork we were meant to use) and tried to get his fingers right. Buthe didn't dare to try really directing the horse; he trusted it would follow the rest. Thehorse was of course an ordinary horse, not a Talking Horse; but it had quite wits enoughto realize that the strange boy on its back had no whip and no spurs and was not reallymaster of the situation. That was why Shasta soon found himself at the tail end of theprocession.

Even so, he was going pretty fast. There were no flies now and the air in his face wasdelicious. He had got his breath back too. And his errand had succeeded. For the firsttime since the arrival at Tashbaan (how long ago it seemed!) he was beginning to enjoyhimself.

He looked up to see how much nearer the mountain tops had come. To hisdisappointment he could not see them at all: only a vague greyness, rolling down towardsthem. He had never been in mountain country before and was surprised. "It's a cloud," hesaid to himself, "a cloud coming down. I see. Up here in the hills one is really in the sky.

I shall see what the inside of a cloud is like. What fun! I've often wondered." Far away onhis left and a little behind him, the sun was getting ready to set.

They had come to a rough kind of road by now and were making very good speed. ButShasta's horse was still the last of the lot. Once or twice when the road made a bend(there was now continuous forest on each side of it) he lost sight of the others for asecond or two.

Then they plunged into the fog, or else the fog rolled over them. The world became grey.

Shasta had not realized how cold and wet the inside of a cloud would be; nor how dark.

The grey turned to black with alarming speed.

Someone at the head of the column winded the horn every now and then, and each timethe sound came from a little farther off. He couldn't see any of the others now, but ofcourse he'd be able to as soon as he got round the next bend. But when he rounded it hestill couldn't see them. In fact he could see nothing at all. His horse was walking now.

"Get on, Horse, get on," said Shasta. Then came the horn, very faint. Bree had alwaystold him that he must keep his heels well turned out, and Shasta had got the idea thatsomething very terrible would happen if he dug his heels into a horse's sides. Thisseemed to him an occasion for trying it. "Look here, Horse," he said, "if you don't buckup, do you know what I'll do? I'll dig my heels into you. I really will." The horse,however, took no notice of this threat. So Shasta settled himself firmly in the saddle,gripped with his knees, clenched his teeth, and punched both the horse's sides with hisheels as hard as he could.

The only result was that the horse broke into a kind of pretence of a trot for five or sixpaces and then subsided into a walk again. And now it was quite dark and they seemed tohave given up blowing that horn. The only sound was a steady drip-drip from thebranches of the trees.

"Well, I suppose even a walk will get us somewhere sometime," said Shasta to himself. "Ionly hope I shan't run into Rabadash and his people."

He went on for what seemed a long time, always at a walking pace. He began to hate thathorse, and he was also beginning to feel very hungry.

Presently he came to a place where the road divided into two. He was just wonderingwhich led to Anvard when he was startled by a noise from behind him. It was the noise oftrotting horses. "Rabadash!" thought Shasta. He had no way of guessing which roadRabadash would take. "But if I take one," said Shasta to himself, "he may take the other:and if I stay at the cross-roads I'm sure to be caught." He dismounted and led his horse asquickly as he could along the right-hand road.

The sound of the cavalry grew rapidly nearer and in a minute or two Shasta realized thatthey were at the crossroads. He held his breath, waiting to see which way they wouldtake.

There came a low word of command "Halt!" then a moment of horsey noises - nostrilsblowing, hoofs pawing, bits being champed, necks being patted. Then a voice spoke.

"Attend, all of you," it said. "We are now within a furlong of the castle. Remember yourorders. Once we are in Narnia, as we should be by sunrise, you are to kill as little aspossible. On this venture you are to regard every drop of Narnian blood as more preciousthan a gallon of your own. On this venture, I say. The gods will send us a happier hourand then you must leave nothing alive between Cair Paravel and the Western Waste. Butwe are not yet in Narnia. Here in Archenland it is another thing. In the assault on thiscastle of King Lune's, nothing matters but speed. Show your mettle. It must be mine

within an hour. And if it is, I give it all to you. I reserve no booty for myself. Kill meevery barbarian male within its walls, down to the child that was born yesterday, andeverything else is yours to divide as you please - the women, the gold, the jewels, theweapons, and the wine. The man that I see hanging back when we come to the gates shallbe burned alive. In the name of Tash the irresistible, the inexorable forward!"

With a great cloppitty-clop the column began to move, and Shasta breathed again. Theyhad taken the other road.

Shasta thought they took a long time going past, for though he had been talking andthinking about "two hundred horse" all day, he had not realized how many they reallywere. But at last the sound died away and once more he was alone amid the drip-dripfrom the trees.

He now knew the way to Anvard but of course he could not now go there: that wouldonly mean running into the arms of Rabadash's troopers. "What on earth am I to do?" saidShasta to himself. But he remounted his horse and continued along the road he hadchosen, in the faint hope of finding some cottage where he might ask for shelter and ameal. He had thought, of course, of going back to Aravis and Bree and Hwin at thehermitage, but he couldn't because by now he had not the least idea of the direction.

"After all," said Shasta, "this road is bound to get to somewhere."

But that all depends on what you mean by somewhere. The road kept on getting tosomewhere in the sense that it got to more and more trees, all dark and dripping, and tocolder and colder air. And strange, icy winds kept blowing the mist past him though theynever blew it away. If he had been used to mountain country he would have realized thatthis meant he was now very high up - perhaps right at the top of the pass. But Shastaknew nothing about mountains.

"I do think," said Shasta, "that I must be the most unfortunate boy that ever lived in thewhole world. Everything goes right for everyone except me. Those Narnian lords andladies got safe away from Tashbaan; I was left behind. Aravis and Bree and Hwin are allas snug as anything with that old Hermit: of course I was the one who was sent on. KingLune and his people must have got safely into the castle and shut the gates long beforeRabadash arrived, but I get left out."

And being very tired and having nothing inside him, he felt so sorry for himself that thetears rolled down his cheeks.

What put a stop to all this was a sudden fright. Shasta discovered that someone orsomebody was walking beside him. It was pitch dark and he could see nothing. And theThing (or Person) was going so quietly that he could hardly hear any footfalls. What hecould hear was breathing. His invisible companion seemed to breathe on a very largescale, and Shasta got the impression that it was a very large creature. And he had come to

notice this breathing so gradually that he had really no idea how long it had been there. Itwas a horrible shock.

It darted into his mind that he had heard long ago that there were giants in these Northerncountries. He bit his lip in terror. But now that he really had something to cry about, hestopped crying.

The Thing (unless it was a Person) went on beside him so very quietly that Shasta beganto hope he had only imagined it. But just as he was becoming quite sure of it, theresuddenly came a deep, rich sigh out of the darkness beside him. That couldn't beimagination! Anyway, he had felt the hot breath of that sigh on his chilly left hand.

If the horse had been any good - or if he had known how to get any good out of the horse- he would have risked everything on a breakaway and a wild gallop. But he knew hecouldn't make that horse gallop. So he went on at a walking pace and the unseencompanion walked and breathed beside him. At last he could bear it no longer.

"Who are you?" he said, scarcely above a whisper.

"One who has waited long for you to speak," said the Thing. Its voice was not loud, butvery large and deep.

"Are you- are you a giant?" asked Shasta.

"You might call me a giant," said the Large Voice. "But I am not like the creatures youcall giants."

"I can't see you at all," said Shasta, after staring very hard. Then (for an even moreterrible idea had come into his head) he said, almost in a scream, "You're not - notsomething dead, are you? Oh please - please do go away. What harm have I ever doneyou? Oh, I am the unluckiest person in the whole world!"

Once more he felt the warm breath of the Thing on his hand and face. "There," it said,"that is not the breath of a ghost. Tell me your sorrows."

Shasta was a little reassured by the breath: so he told how he had never known his realfather or mother and had been brought up sternly by the fisherman. And then he told thestory of his escape and how they were chased by lions and forced to swim for their lives;and of all their dangers in Tashbaan and about his night among the tombs and how thebeasts howled at him out of the desert. And he told about the heat and thirst of theirdesert journey and how they were almost at their goal when another lion chased them andwounded Aravis. And also, how very long it was since he had had anything to eat.

"I do not call you unfortunate," said the Large Voice.

"Don't you think it was bad luck to meet so many lions?" said Shasta.

"There was only one lion," said the Voice.

"What on earth do you mean? I've just told you there were at least two the first night,and-"

"There was only one: but he was swift of foot."

"How do you know?"

"I was the lion." And as Shasta gaped with open mouth and said nothing, the Voicecontinued. "I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat whocomforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals fromyou while you slept. I was the lion who gave the Horses the new strength of fear for thelast mile so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do notremember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came toshore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you."

"Then it was you who wounded Aravis?"

"It was I"

"But what for?"

"Child," said the Voice, "I am telling you your story, not hers. I tell no one any story buthis own."

"Who are you?" asked Shasta.

"Myself," said the Voice, very deep and low so that the earth shook: and again "Myself",loud and clear and gay: and then the third time "Myself", whispered so softly you couldhardly hear it, and yet it seemed to come from all round you as if the leaves rustled withit.

Shasta was no longer afraid that the Voice belonged to something that would eat him, northat it was the voice of a ghost. But a new and different sort of trembling came over him.

Yet he felt glad too.

The mist was turning from black to grey and from grey to white. This must have begun tohappen some time ago, but while he had been talking to the Thing he had not beennoticing anything else. Now, the whiteness around him became a shining whiteness; hiseyes began to blink. Somewhere ahead he could hear birds singing. He knew the nightwas over at last. He could see the mane and ears and head of his horse quite easily now.

A golden light fell on them from the left. He thought it was the sun.

He turned and saw, pacing beside him, taller than the horse, a Lion. The horse did notseem to be afraid of it or else could not see it. It was from the Lion that the light came.

No one ever saw anything more terrible or beautiful.

Luckily Shasta had lived all his life too far south in Calormen to have heard the tales thatwere whispered in Tashbaan about a dreadful Narnian demon that appeared in the form ofa lion. And of course he knew none of the true stories about Aslan, the great Lion, the sonof the Emperor-over-the-sea, the King above all High Kings in Narnia. But after oneglance at the Lion's face he slipped out of the saddle and fell at its feet. He couldn't sayanything but then he didn't want to say anything, and he knew he needn't say anything.

The High King above all kings stooped towards him. Its mane, and some strange andsolemn perfume that hung about the mane, was all round him. It touched his foreheadwith its tongue. He lifted his face and their eyes met. Then instantly the pale brightness ofthe mist and the fiery brightness of the Lion rolled themselves together into a swirlingglory and gathered themselves up and disappeared. He was alone with the horse on agrassy hillside under a blue sky. And there were birds singing.
