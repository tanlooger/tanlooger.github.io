title: CHAPTER 6. SHASTA AMONG THE TOMBS
---

SHASTA ran lightly along the roof on tiptoes. It felt hot to his bare feet. He was only afew seconds scrambling up the wall at the far end and when he got to the corner he foundhimself looking down into a narrow, smelly street, and there was a rubbish heap againstthe outside of the wall just as Corin had told him. Before jumping down he took a rapidglance round him to get his bearings. Apparently he had now come over the crown of theisland-hill on which Tashbaan is built. Everything sloped away before him, flat roofsbelow flat roofs, down to the towers and battlements of the city's Northern wall. Beyondthat was the river and beyond the river a short slope covered with gardens. But beyondthat again there was something he had never seen the like of - a great yellowish-greything, flat as a calm sea, and stretching for miles. On the far side of it were huge bluethings, lumpy but with jagged edges, and some of them with white tops. "The desert! themountains!" thought Shasta.

He jumped down on to the rubbish and began trotting along downhill as fast as he couldin the narrow lane, which soon brought him into a wider street where there were morepeople. No one bothered to look at a little ragged boy running along on bare feet. Still, hewas anxious and uneasy till he turned a corner and there saw the city gate in front of him.

Here he was pressed and jostled a bit, for a good many other people were also going out;and on the bridge beyond the gate the crowd became quite a slow procession, more like aqueue than a crowd. Out there, with clear running water on each side, it was deliciouslyfresh after the smell and heat and noise of Tashbaan.

When once Shasta had reached the far end of the bridge he found the crowd meltingaway; everyone seemed to be going either to the left or right along the river bank. Hewent straight ahead up a road that did not appear to be much used, between gardens. In afew paces he was alone, and a few more brought him to the top of the slope. There hestood and stared. It was like coming to the end of the world for all the grass stopped quitesuddenly a few feet before him and the sand began: endless level sand like on a sea shorebut a bit rougher because it was never wet. The mountains, which now looked further offthan before, loomed ahead. Greatly to his relief he saw, about five minutes' walk away onhis left, what must certainly be the Tombs, just as Bree had described them; great massesof mouldering stone shaped like gigantic bee-hive, but a little narrower. They looked veryblack and grim, for the sun was now setting right behind them.

He turned his face West and trotted towards the Tombs. He could not help looking outvery hard for any sign of his friends, though the setting sun shone in his face so that hecould see hardly anything. "And anyway," he thought, "of course they'll be round on thefar side of the farthest Tomb, not this side where anyone might see them from the city."

There were about twelve Tombs, each with a low arched doorway that opened intoabsolute blackness. They were dotted about in no kind of order, so that it took a longtime, going round this one and going round that one, before you could be sure that youhad looked round every side of every tomb. This was what Shasta had to do. There wasnobody there.

It was very quiet here out on the edge of the desert; and now the sun had really set.

Suddenly from somewhere behind him there came a terrible sound. Shasta's heart gave agreat jump and he had to bite his tongue to keep himself from screaming. Next momenthe realized what it was: the horns of Tashbaan blowing for the closing of the gates.

"Don't be a silly little coward," said Shasta to himself. "Why, it's only the same noise youheard this morning." But there is a great difference between a noise heard letting you inwith your friends in the morning, and a noise heard alone at nightfall, shutting you out.

And now that the gates were shut he knew there was no chance of the others joining himthat evening. "Either they're shut up in Tashbaan for the night," thought Shasta, "or elsethey've gone on without me. It's just the sort of thing that Aravis would do. But Breewouldn't. Oh, he wouldn't. - now, would he?"

In this idea about Aravis Shasta was once more quite wrong. She was proud and could behard enough but she was as true as steel and would never have deserted a companion,whether she liked him or not.

Now that Shasta knew he would have to spend the night alone (it was getting darkerevery minute) he began to like the look of the place less and less. There was somethingvery uncomfortable about those great, silent shapes of stone. He had been trying hishardest for a long time not to think of ghouls: but he couldn't keep it up any longer.

"Ow! Ow! Help!" he shouted suddenly, for at that very moment he felt something touchhis leg. I don't think anyone can be blamed for shouting if something comes up frombehind and touches him; not in such a place and at such a time, when he is frightenedalready. Shasta at any rate was too frightened to run. Anything would be better than beingchased round and round the burial places of the Ancient Kings with something he darednot look at behind him. Instead, he did what was really the most sensible thing he coulddo. He looked round; and his heart almost burst with relief. What had touched him wasonly a cat.

The light was too bad now for Shasta to see much of the cat except that it was big andvery solemn. It looked as if it might have lived for long, long years among the Tombs,alone. Its eyes made you think it knew secrets it would not tell.

"Puss, puss," said Shasta. "I suppose you're not a talking cat."

The cat stared at him harder than ever. Then it started walking away, and of course Shastafollowed it. It led him right through the tombs and out on the desert side of them. There itsat down bolt upright with its tail curled round its feet and its face set towards the desertand towards Narnia and the North, as still as if it were watching for some enemy. Shastalay down beside it with his back against the cat and his face towards the Tombs, becauseif one is nervous there's nothing like having your face towards the danger and havingsomething warm and solid at your back. The sand wouldn't have seemed verycomfortable to you, but Shasta had been sleeping on the ground for weeks and hardlynoticed it. Very soon he fell asleep, though even in his dreams he went on wonderingwhat had happened to Bree and Aravis and Hwin.

He was wakened suddenly by a noise he had never heard before. "Perhaps it was only anightmare," said Shasta to himself. At the same moment he noticed that the cat had gonefrom his back, and he wished it hadn't. But he lay quite still without even opening hiseyes because he felt sure he would be more frightened if he sat up and looked round atthe Tombs and the loneliness: just as you or I might lie still with the clothes over ourheads. But then the noise came again - a harsh, piercing cry from behind him out of thedesert. Then of course he had to open his eyes and sit up.

The moon was shining brightly. The Tombs - far bigger and nearer than he had thoughtthey would be - looked grey in the moonlight. In fact, they looked horribly like hugepeople, draped in grey robes that covered their heads and faces. They were not at all nicethings to have near you when spending a night alone in a strange place. But the noise hadcome from the opposite side, from the desert. Shasta had to turn his back on the Tombs(he didn't like that much) and stare out across the level sand. The wild cry rang out again.

"I hope it's not more lions," thought Shasta. It was in fact not very like the lion's roars hehad heard on the night when they met Hwin and Aravis, and was really the cry of ajackal. But of course Shasta did not know this. Even if he had known, he would not havewanted very much to meet a jackal.

The cries rang out again and again. "There's more than one of them, whatever they are,"thought Shasta. "And they're coming nearer."

I suppose that if he had been an entirely sensible boy he would have gone back throughthe Tombs nearer to the river where there were houses, and wild beasts would be lesslikely to come. But then there were (or he thought there were) the ghouls. To go backthrough the Tombs would mean going past those dark openings in the Tombs; and whatmight come out of them? It may have been silly, but Shasta felt he would rather risk thewild beasts. Then, as the cries came nearer and nearer, he began to change his mind.

He was just going to run for it when suddenly, between him and the desert, a huge animalbounded into view. As the moon was behind it, it looked quite black, and Shasta did notknow what it was, except that it had a very big, shaggy head and went on four legs. It didnot seem to have noticed Shasta, for it suddenly stopped, turned its head towards thedesert and let out a roar which re-echoed through the Tombs and seemed to shake thesand under Shasta's feet. The cries of the other creatures suddenly stoppd and he thoughthe could hear feet scampering away. Then the great beast turned to examine Shasta.

"It's a lion, I know it's a lion," thought Shasta. "I'm done. I wonder will it hurt much. Iwish it was over. I wonder does anything happen to people after they're dead. O-o-oh!

Here it comes!" And he shut his eyes and his teeth tight.

But instead of teeth and claws he only felt something warm lying down at his feet. Andwhen he opened his eyes he said, "Why, it's not nearly as big as I thought! It's only halfthe size. No, it isn't even quarter the size. I do declare it's only the cat!! I must havedreamed all that about its being as big as a horse."

And whether he really had been dreaming or not, what was now lying at his feet, andstaring him out of countenance with its big, green, unwinking eyes, was the cat; thoughcertainly one of the largest cats he had ever seen.

"Oh, Puss," gasped Shasta. "I am so glad to see you again. I've been having such horribledreams." And he at once lay down again, back to back with the cat as they had been at thebeginning of the night. The warmth from it spread all over him.

"I'll never do anything nasty to a cat again as long as I live," said Shasta, half to the catand half to himself. "I did once, you know. I threw stones at a half-starved mangy oldstray. Hey! Stop that." For the cat had turned round and given him a scratch. "None ofthat," said Shasta. "It isn't as if you could understand what I'm saying." Then he dozedoff.

Next morning when he woke, the cat was gone, the sun was already up, and the sand hot.

Shasta, very thirsty, sat up and rubbed his eyes. The desert was blindingly white and,though there was a murmur of noises from the city behind him, where he sat everythingwas perfectly still. When he looked a little left and west, so that the sun was not in hiseyes, he could see the mountains on the far side of the desert, so sharp and clear that theylooked only a stone's throw away. He particularly noticed one blue height that dividedinto two peaks at the top and decided that it must be Mount Pire. "That's our direction,judging by what the Raven said," he thought, "so I'll just make sure of it, so as not towaste any time when the others turn up." So he made a good, deep straight furrow withhis foot pointing exactly to Mount Pire.

The next job, clearly, was to get something to eat and drink. Shasta trotted back throughthe Tombs - they looked quite ordinary now and he wondered how he could ever havebeen afraid of them - and down into the cultivated land by the river's side. There were afew people about but not very many, for the city gates had been open several hours andthe early morning crowds had already gone in. So he had no diffculty in doing a little"raiding" (as Bree called it). It involved a climb over a garden wall and the results werethree oranges, a melon, a fig or two, and a pomegranate. After that, he went down to theriver bank, but not too near the bridge, and had a drink. The water was so nice that hetook off his hot, dirty clothes and had a dip; for of course Shasta, having lived on theshore all his life, had learned to swim almost as soon as he had learned to walk. When hecame out he lay on the grass looking across the water at Tashbaan - all the splendour andstrength and glory of it. But that made him remember the dangers of it too. He suddenlyrealized that the others might have reached the Tombs while he was bathing ("and goneon without me, as likely as not"), so he dressed in a fright and tore back at such a speedthat he was all hot and thirsty when he arrived and so the good of his bathe was gone.

Like most days when you are alone and waiting for something this day seemed about ahundred hours long. He had plenty to think of, of course, but sitting alone, just thinking,is pretty slow. He thought a good deal about the Narnians and especially about Corin. Hewondered what had happened when they discovered that the boy who had been lying onthe sofa and hearing all their secret plans wasn't really Corin at all. It was very unpleasantto think of all those nice people imagining him a traitor.

But as the sun slowly, slowly climbed up to the top of the sky and then slowly, slowlybegan going downwards to the West, and no one came and nothing at all happened, hebegan to get more and more anxious. And of course he now realized that when theyarranged to wait for one another at the Tombs no one had said anything about How Long.

He couldn't wait here for the rest of his life! And soon it would be dark again, and hewould have another night just like last night. A dozen different plans went through hishead, all wretched ones, and at last he fixed on the worst plan of all. He decided to waittill it was dark and then go back to the river and steal as many melons as he could carryand set out for Mount Pire alone, trusting for his direction to the line he had drawn thatmorning in the sand. It was a crazy idea and if he had read as many books as you haveabout journeys over deserts he would never have dreamed of it. But Shasta had read nobooks at all.

Before the sun set something did happen. Shasta was sitting in the shadow of one of theTombs when he looked up and saw two horses coming towards him. Then his heart gavea great leap, for he recognized them as Bree and Hwin. But the next moment his heartwent down into his toes again. There was no sign of Aravis. The Horses were being ledby a strange man, an armed man pretty handsomely dressed like an upper slave in a greatfamily. Bree and Hwin were no longer got up like pack-horses, but saddled and bridled.

And what could it all mean? "It's a trap," thought Shasta. "Somebody has caught Aravisand perhaps they've tortured her and she's given the whole thing away. They want me tojump out and run up and speak to Bree and then I'll be caught too! And yet if I don't, Imay be losing my only chance to meet the others. Oh I do wish I knew what hadhappened." And he skulked behind the Tomb, looking out every few minutes, andwondering which was the least dangerous thing to do.
