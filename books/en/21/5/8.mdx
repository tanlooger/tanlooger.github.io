title: CHAPTER 8. IN THE HOUSE OF THE TISROC
---

"OH-my-father-and-oh-the-delight-of-my-eyes," began the young man, muttering thewords very quickly and sulkily and not at all as if the Tisroc were the delight of his eyes.

"May you live for ever, but you have utterly destroyed me. If you had given me theswiftest of the galleys at sunrise when I first saw that the ship of the accursed barbarianswas gone from her place I would perhaps have overtaken them. But you persuaded me tosend first and see if they had not merely moved round the point into better anchorage.

And now the whole day has been wasted. And they are gone - gone - out of my reach!

The false jade, the-" and here he added a great many descriptions of Queen Susan whichwould not look at all nice in print. For of course this young man was Prince Rabadashand of course the false jade was Susan of Narnia.

"Compose yourself, O my son," said the Tisroc. "For the departure of guests makes awound that is easily healed in the heart of a judicious host."

"But I want her," cried the Prince. "I must have her. I shall die if I do not get her- false,proud, black-hearted daughter of a dog that she is! I cannot sleep and my food has nosavour and my eyes are darkened because of her beauty. I must have the barbarianqueen."

"How well it was said by a gifted poet," observed the Vizier, raising his face (in asomewhat dusty condition) from the carpet, "that deep draughts from the fountain ofreason are desirable in order to extinguish the fire of youthful love."

This seemed to exasperate the Prince. "Dog," he shouted, directing a series of well-aimedkicks at the hindquarters of the Vizier, "do not dare to quote the poets to me. I have hadmaxims and verses flung at me all day and I can endure them no more." I am afraidAravis did not feel at all sorry for the Vizier.

The Tisroc was apparently sunk in thought, but when, after a long pause, he noticed whatwas happening, he said tranquilly:

"My son, by all means desist from kicking the venerable and enlightened Vizier: for as acostly jewel retains its value even if hidden in a dung-hill, so old age and discretion are tobe respected even in the vile persons of our subjects. Desist therefore, and tell us whatyou desire and propose."

"I desire and propose, O my father," said Rabadash, "that you immediately call out yourinvincible armies and invade the thrice-accursed land of Narnia and waste it with fire andsword and add it to your illimitable empire, killing their High King and all of his bloodexcept the queen Susan. For I must have her as my wife, though she shall learn a sharplesson first."

"Understand, O my son," said the Tisroc, "that no words you can speak will move me toopen war against Narnia."

"If you were not my father, O ever-living Tisroc, " said the Prince, grinding his teeth, "Ishould say that was the word of a coward."

"And if you were not my son, O most inflammable Rabadash," replied his father, "yourlife would be short and your death slow when you had said it." (The cool, placid voice inwhich he spoke these words made Aravis's blood run cold.)

"But why, O my father," said the Prince - this time in a much more respectful voice, "whyshould we think twice about punishing Narnia any more than about hanging an idle slaveor sending a worn-out horse to be made into dog'smeat? It is not the fourth size of one ofyour least provinces. A thousand spears could conquer it in five weeks. It is an unseemlyblot on the skirts of your empire."

"Most undoubtedly," said the Tisroc. "These little barbarian countries that call themselvesfree (which is as much as to say, idle, disordered, and unprofitable) are hateful to thegods and to all persons of discernment."

"Then why have we suffered such a land as Narnia to remain thus long unsubdued?"

"Know, O enlightened Prince," said the Grand Vizier, "that until the year in which yourexalted father began his salutary and unending reign, the land of Narnia was covered withice and snow and was moreover ruled by a most powerful enchantress."

"This I know very well, O loquacious Vizier," answered the Prince. "But I know also thatthe enchantress is dead. And the ice and snow have vanished, so that Narnia is nowwholesome, fruitful, and delicious."

"And this change, O most learned Prince, has doubtless been brought to pass by thepowerful incantations of those wicked persons who now call themselves kings andqueens of Narnia."

"I am rather of the opinion," said Rabadash, "that it has come about by the alteration ofthe stars and the operation of natural causes."

"All this," said the Tisroc, "is a question for the disputations of learned men. I will neverbelieve that so great an alteration, and the killing of the old enchantress, were effectedwithout the aid of strong magic. And such things are to be expected in that land, which ischiefly inhabited by demons in the shape of beasts that talk like men, and monsters thatare half man and half beast. It is commonly reported that the High King of Narnia (whommay the gods utterly reject) is supported by a demon of hideous aspect and irresistiblemaleficence who appears in the shape of a Lion. Therefore the attacking of Narnia is adark and doubtful enterprise, and I am determined not to put my hand out farther than Ican draw it back."

"How blessed is Calormen," said the Vizier, popping up his face again, "on whose rulerthe gods have been pleased to bestow prudence and circumspection! Yet as the irrefutableand sapient Tisroc has said it is very grievous to be constrained to keep our hands offsuch a dainty dish as Narnia. Gifted was that poet who said -" but at this point Ahoshtanoticed an impatient movement of the Prince's toe and became suddenly silent.

"It is very grievous," said the Tisroc in his deep, quiet voice. "Every morning the sun isdarkened in my eyes, and every night my sleep is the less refreshing, because I rememberthat Narnia is still free."

"O my father," said Rabadash. "How if I show you a way by which you can stretch outyour arm to take Narnia and yet draw it back unharmed if the attempt prove unfortunate?"

"If you can show me that, O Rabadash," said the Tisroc, "you will be the best of sons."

"Hear then, 0 father. This very night and in this hour I will take but two hundred horseand ride across the desert. And it shall seem to all men that you know nothing of mygoing. On the second morning I shall be at the gates of King Lune's castle of Anvard inArchenland. They are at peace with us and unprepared and I shall take Anvard beforethey have bestirred themselves. Then I will ride through the pass above Anvard and downthrough Narnia to Cair Paravel. The High King will not be there; when I left them he wasalready preparing a raid against the giants on his northern border. I shall find CairParavel, most likely with open gates, and ride in. I shall exercise prudence and courtesyand spill as little Narnian blood as I can. And what then remains but to sit there till theSplendour Hyaline puts in, with Queen Susan on board, catch my strayed bird as she setsfoot ashore, swing her into the saddle, and then, ride, ride, ride back to Anvard?"

"But is it not probable, O my son," said the Tisroc, "that at the taking of the woman eitherKing Edmund or you will lose his life?"

"They will be a small company," said Rabadash, "and I will order ten of my men todisarm and bind him: restraining my vehement desire for his blood so that there shall beno deadly cause of war between you and the High King."

"And how if the Splendour Hyaline is at Cair Paravel before you?"

"I do not look for that with these winds, O my father."

"And lastly, O my resourceful son," said the Tisroc, "you have made clear how all thismight give you the barbarian woman, but not how it helps me to the over-throwing ofNarnia."

"O my father, can it have escaped you that though I and my horsemen will come and gothrough Narnia like an arrow from a bow, yet we shall have Anvard for ever? And whenyou hold Anvard you sit in the very gate of Narnia, and your garrison in Anvard can beincreased by little and little till it is a great host."

"It is spoken with understanding and foresight. But how do I draw back my arm if all thismiscarries?"

"You shall say that I, did it without your knowledge and against your will, and withoutyour blessing, being constrained by the violence of my love and the impetuosity ofyouth."

"And how if the High King then demands that we send back the barbarian woman, hissister?"

"O my father, be assured that he will not. For though the fancy of a woman has rejectedthis marriage, the High King Peter is a man of prudence and understanding who will inno way wish to lose the high honour and advantage of being allied to our House andseeing his nephew and grand nephew on the throne of Calormen."

"He will not see that if I live for ever as is no doubt your wish," said the Tisroc in an evendrier voice than usual.

"And also, O my father and O the delight of my eyes," said the Prince, after a moment ofawkward silence, "we shall write letters as if from the Queen to say that she loves me andhas no desire to return to Narnia. For it is well known that women are as changeable asweathercocks. And even if they do not wholly believe the letters, they will not dare tocome to Tashbaan in arms to fetch her."

"O enlightened Vizier," said the Tisroc, "bestow your wisdom upon us concerning thisstrange proposal."

"O eternal Tisroc," answered Ahosta, "the strength of paternal affection is not unknownto me and I have often heard that sons are in the eyes of their fathers more precious thancarbuncles. How then shall I dare freely to unfold to you my mind in a matter which mayimperil the life of this exalted Prince?"

"Undoubtedly you will dare," replied the Tisroc.

"Because you will find that the dangers of not doing so are at least equally great."

"To hear is to obey," moaned the wretched man. "Know then, O most reasonable Tisroc,in the first place, that the danger of the Prince is not altogether so great as might appear.

For the gods have withheld from the barbarians the light of discretion, as that their poetryis not, like ours, full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims, but is all of love andwar. Therefore nothing will appear to them more noble and admirable than such a madenterprise as this of ow!" For the Prince, at the word "mad", had kicked him again.

"Desist, O my son," said the Tisroc. "And you, estimable Vizier, whether he desists ornot, by no means allow the flow of your eloquence to be interrupted. For nothing is moresuitable to persons of gravity and decorum than to endure minor inconveniences withconstancy."

"To hear is to obey," said the Vizier, wriggling himself round a little so as to get hishinder parts further away from Rabadash's toe. "Nothing, I say, will seem as pardonable,if not estimable, in their eyes as this - er - hazardous attempt, especially because it isundertaken for the love of a woman. Therefore, if the Prince by misfortune fell into theirhands, they would assuredly not kill him. Nay, it may even be, that though he failed to

carry off the queen, yet the sight of his great valour and of the extremity of his passionmight incline her heart to him."

"That is a good point, old babbler," said Rabadash. "Very good, however it came intoyour ugly head."

"The praise of my masters is the light of my eyes," said Ahoshta. "And secondly, OTisroc, whose reign must and shall be interminable, I think that with the aid of the gods itis very likely that Anvard will fall into the Prince's hands. And if so, we have Narnia bythe throat."

There was a long pause and the room became so silent that the two girls hardly dared tobreathe. At last the Tisroc spoke.

"Go, my son," he said. "And do as you have said. But expect no help nor countenancefrom me. I will not avenge you if you are killed and I will not deliver you if thebarbarians cast you into prison. And if, either in success or failure, you shed a drop morethan you need of Narnian noble blood and open war arises from it, my favour shall neverfall upon you again and your next brother shall have your place in Calormen. Now go. Beswift, secret, and fortunate. May the strength of Tash the inexorable, the irresistible be inyour sword and lance."

"To hear is to obey," cried Rabadash, and after kneeling for a moment to kiss his father'shands he rushed from the room. Greatly to the disappointment of Aravis, who was nowhorribly cramped, the Tisroc and Vizier remained.

"O Vizier," said the Tisroc, "is it certain that no living soul knows of this council wethree have held here tonight?"

"O my master," said Ahoshta, "it is not possible that any should know. For that veryreason I proposed, and you in your wisdom agreed, that we should meet here in the OldPalace where no council is ever held and none of the household has any occasion tocome."

"It is well," said the Tisroc. "If any man knew, I would see to it that he died before anhour had passed. And do you also, O prudent Vizier, forget it. I sponge away from myown heart and from yours all knowledge of the Prince's plans. He is gone without myknowledge or my consent, I know not whither, because of his violence and the rash anddisobedient disposition of youth. No man will be more astonished than you and I to hearthat Anvard is in his hands."

"To hear is to obey," said Ahoshta.

"That is why you will never think even in your secret heart that I am the hardest heartedof fathers who thus send my first-born son on an errand so likely to be his death; pleasingas it must be to you who do not love the Prince. For 1 see into the bottom of your mind."

"O impeccable Tisroc," said the Vizier. "In comparison with you I love neither the Princenor my own life nor bread nor water nor the light of the sun."

"Your sentiments," said the Tisroc, "are elevated and correct. I also love none of thesethings in comparison with the glory and strength of my throne. If the Prince succeeds, wehave Archenland, and perhaps hereafter Narnia. If he fails - I have eighteen other sonsand Rabadash, after the manner of the eldest sons of kings, was beginning to bedangerous. More than five Tisrocs in Tashbaan have died before their time because theireldest sons, enlightened princes, grew tired of waiting for their throne. He had better coolhis blood abroad than boil it in inaction here. And now, O excellent Vizier, the excess ofmy paternal anxiety inclines me to sleep. Command the musicians to my chamber. Butbefore you lie down, call back the pardon we wrote for the third cook. I feel within methe manifest prognostics of indigestion."

"To hear is to obey," said the Grand Vizier. He crawled backwards on all fours to thedoor, rose, bowed, and went out. Even then the Tisroc remained seated in silence on thedivan till Aravis almost began to be afraid that he had dropped asleep. But at last with agreat creaking and sighing he heaved up his enormous body, signed to the slaves toprecede him with the lights, and went out. The door closed behind him, the room wasonce more totally dark, and the two girls could breathe freely again.
