title: CHAPTER 12. SHASTA IN NARNIA
---

"WAS it all a dream?" wondered Shasta. But it couldn't have been a dream for there inthe grass before him he saw the deep, large print of the Lion's front right paw. It tookone's breath away to think of the weight that could make a footprint like that. But therewas something more remarkable than the size about it. As he looked at it, water hadalready filled the bottom of it. Soon it was full to the brim, and then overflowing, and alittle stream was running downhill, past him, over the grass.

Shasta stooped and drank - a very long drink - and then dipped his face in and splashedhis head. It was extremely cold, and clear as glass, and refreshed him very much. Afterthat he stood up, shaking the water out of his ears and flinging the wet hair back from hisforehead, and began to take stock of his surroundings.

Apparently it was still very early morning. The sun had only just risen, and it had risenout of the forests which he saw low down and far away on his right. The country j whichhe was looking at was absolutely new to him. It was t a green valley-land dotted withtrees through which he caught the gleam of a river that wound away roughly to the North-

West. On the far side of the valley there were high and even rocky hills, but they werelower than the mountains he had seen yesterday. Then he began to guess where he was.

He turned and looked behind him and saw that the slope on which he was standingbelonged to a range of far higher mountains.

"I see," said Shasta to himself. "Those are the big mountains between Archenland andNarnia. I was on theÂ°. other side of them yesterday. I must have come through the pass inthe night. What luck that I hit it! - at least it wasn't luck at all really, it was Him. And nowI'm in Narnia."

He turned and unsaddled his horse and took off its bridle - "Though you are a perfectlyhorrid horse," he said. It took no notice of this remark and immediately began eatinggrass. That horse had a very low opinion of Shasta.

"I wish I could eat grass!" thought Shasta. "It's no good going back to Anvard, it'll all bebesieged. I'd better get lower down into the valley and see if I can get anything to eat."

So he went on downhill (the thick dew was cruelly cold to his bare feet) till he came intoa wood. There was a kind of track running through it and he had not followed this formany minutes when he heard a thick and rather wheezy voice saying to him.

"Good morning, neighbour."

Shasta looked round eagerly to find the speaker and presently saw a small, prickly personwith a dark face who had just come out from among the trees. At least, it was small for aperson but very big indeed for a hedgehog, which was what it was.

"Good morning," said Shasta. "But I'm not a neighbour. In fact I'm a stranger in theseparts."

"Ah?" said the Hedgehog inquiringly.

"I've come over the mountains - from Archenland, you know."

"Ha, Archenland," said the Hedgehog. "That's a terrible long way. Never been theremyself."

"And I think, perhaps," said Shasta, "someone ought to be told that there's an army ofsavage Calormenes attacking Anvard at this very moment."

"You don't say so!" answered the Hedgehog. "Well, think of that. And they do say thatCalormen is hundreds and thousands of miles away, right at the world's end, across agreat sea of sand."

"It's not nearly as far as you think," said Shasta. "And oughtn't something to be doneabout this attack on Anvard? Oughtn't your High King to be told?"

"Certain sure, something ought to be done about it," said the Hedgehog. "But you see I'mjust on my way to bed for a good day's sleep. Hullo, neighbour!"

The last words were addressed to an immense biscuitcoloured rabbit whose head had justpopped up from somewhere beside the path. The Hedgehog immediately told the Rabbitwhat it had just learned from Shasta. The Rabbit agreed that this was very remarkablenews and that somebody ought to tell someone about it with a view to doing something.

And so it went on. Every few minutes they were joined by other creatures, some from thebranches overhead and some from little underground houses at their feet, till the partyconsisted of five rabbits, a squirrel, two magpies, a goat-foot faun, and a mouse, who alltalked at the same time and all agreed with the Hedgehog. For the truth was that in thatgolden age when the Witch and the Winter had gone and Peter the High King ruled atCair Paravel, the smaller woodland people of Narnia were so safe and happy that theywere getting a little careless.

Presently, however, two more practical people arrived in the little wood. One was a RedDwarf whose name appeared to be Duffle. The other was a stag, a beautiful lordlycreature with wide liquid eyes, dappled flanks and legs so thin and graceful that theylooked as if you could break them with two fingers.

"Lion alive!" roared the Dwarf as soon as he had heard the news. "And if that's so, whyare we all standing still, chattering? Enemies at Anvard! News must be sent to CairParavel at once. The army must be called out. Narnia must go to the aid of King Lune."

"Ah!" said the Hedgehog. "But you won't find the High King at the Cair. He's away to theNorth trouncing those giants. And talking of giants, neighbours, that puts me in mind -"

"Who'll take our message?" interrupted the Dwarf. "Anyone here got more speed thanme?"

"I've got speed," said the Stag. "What's my message? How many Calormenes?"

"Two hundred: under Prince Rabadash. And -" But the Stag was already away - all fourlegs off the ground at once, and in a moment its white stern had disappeared among theremoter trees.

"Wonder where he's going," said a Rabbit. "He won't find the High King at Cair Paravel,you know."

"He'll find Queen Lucy," said Duffle. "And then hullo! What's wrong with the Human? Itlooks pretty green. Why, I do believe it's quite faint. Perhaps it's mortal hungry. When didyou last have a meal, youngster?"

"Yesterday morning," said Shasta weakly.

"Come on, then, come on," said the Dwarf, at once throwing his thick little arms roundShasta's waist to support him. "Why, neighbours, we ought all to be ashamed ofourselves! You come with me, lad. Breakfast! Better than talking."

With a great deal' of bustle, muttering reproaches to itself, the Dwarf half led and halfsupported Shasta at a great speed further into the wood and a little downhill. It was alonger walk than Shasta wanted at that moment and his legs had begun to feel very shakybefore they came out from the trees on to bare hillside. There they found a little housewith a smoking chimney and an open door, and as they came to the doorway Dufflecalled out,

"Hey, brothers! A visitor for breakfast."

And immediately, mixed with a sizzling sound, there came to Shasta a simply delightfulsmell. It was one he had never smelled in his life before, but I hope you have. It was, infact, the smell of bacon and eggs and mushrooms all frying in a pan.

"Mind your head, lad," said Duffle a moment too late, for Shasta had already bashed hisforehead against the low lintel of the door. "Now," continued the Dwarf, "sit you down.

The table's a bit low for you, but then the stool's low too. That's right. And here's porridge- and here's a jug of cream - and here's a spoon."

By the time Shasta had finished his porridge, the Dwarf's two brothers (whose nameswere Rogin and Bricklethumb) were putting the dish of bacon and eggs and mushrooms,and the coffee pot and the hot milk, and the toast, on the table.

It was all new and wonderful to Shasta for Calormene food is quite different. He didn'teven know what the slices of brown stuff were, for he had never seen toast before. Hedidn't know what the yellow soft thing they smeared on the toast was, because inCalormen you nearly always get oil instead of butter. And the house itself was quitedifferent from the dark, frowsty, fish-smelling but of Arsheesh and from the pillared andcarpeted halls in the palaces of Tashbaan. The roof was very low, and everything wasmade of wood, and there was a cuckoo-clock and a red-and-white checked table-clothand a bowl of wild flowers and little curtains on the thick-paned windows. It was alsorather troublesome having to use dwarf cups and plates and knives and forks. This meantthat helpings were very small, but then there were a great many helpings, so that Shasta'splate or cup was being filled every moment, and every moment the Dwarfs themselveswere saying, "Butter please", or "Another cup of coffee," or "I'd like a few moremushrooms," or "What about frying another egg or so?" And when at last they had alleaten as much as they possibly could the three Dwarfs drew lots for who would do thewashing-up, and Rogin was the unlucky one. Then Duffle and Bricklethumb took Shastaoutside to a bench which ran against the cottage wall, and they all stretched out their legsand gave a great sigh of contentment and the two Dwarfs lit their pipes. The dew was offthe grass now and the sun was warm; indeed, if there hadn't been a light breeze, it wouldhave been too hot.

"Now, Stranger," said Duffle, "I'll show you the lie of the land. You can see nearly allSouth Narnia from here, and we're rather proud of the view. Right away on your left,

beyond those near hills, you can just see the Western Mountains. And that round hillaway on your right is called the Hill of the Stone Table. Just beyond -"

But at that moment he was interrupted by a snore from Shasta who, what with his night'sjourney and his excellent breakfast, had gone fast asleep. The kindly Dwarfs, as soon asthey noticed this, began making signs to each other not to wake him, and indeed did somuch whispering and nodding and getting up and -tiptoeing away that they certainlywould have waked him if he had been less tired.

He slept pretty well -nearly all day but woke up in time for supper. The beds in that housewere all too small for him but they made him a fine bed of heather on the floor, and henever stirred nor dreamed all night. Next morning they had just finished breakfast whenthey heard a shrill, exciting sound from outside.

"Trumpets!" said all the Dwarfs, as they and Shasta all came running out.

The trumpets sounded again: a new noise to Shasta, not huge and solemn like the hornsof Tashbaan nor gay and merry like King Lune's hunting horn, but clear and sharp andvaliant. The noise was coming from the woods to the East, and soon there was a noise ofhorse-hoofs mixed with it. A moment later the head of the column came into sight.

First came the Lord Peridan on a bay horse carrying the great banner of Narnia - a redlion on a green ground. Shasta knew him at once. Then came three people riding abreast,two on great chargers and one on a pony. The two on the chargers were King Edmundand a fair-haired lady with a very merry face who wore a helmet and a mail shirt andcarried a bow across her shoulder and a quiver full of arrows at her side. ("The QueenLucy," whispered Duffle.) But the one on the pony was Corin. After that came the mainbody of the army: men on ordinary horses, men on Talking Horses (who didn't mindbeing ridden on proper occasions, as when Narnia went to war), centaurs, stern, hard-

bitten bears, great Talking Dogs, and last of all six giants. For there are good giants inNarnia. But though he knew they were on the right side Shasta at first could hardly bearto look at them; there are some things that take a lot of getting used to.

Just as the King and Queen reached the cottage and the Dwarfs began making low bowsto them, King Edmund called out,

"Now, friends! Time for a halt and a morsel!" and at once there was a great bustle ofpeople dismounting and haversacks being opened and conversation beginning whenCorm came running up to Shasta and seized both his hands and cried,

"What! You here! So you got through all right? I am glad. Now we shall have some sport.

And isn't it luck! We only got into harbour at Cair Paravel yesterday morning and thevery first person who met us was Chervy the Stag with all this news of an attack onAnvard. Don't you think -"

"Who is your Highness's friend?" said King Edmund who had just got off his horse.

"Don't you see, Sire?" said Corin. "It's my double: the boy you mistook me for atTashbaan."

"Why, so he is your double," exclaimed Queen Lucy. "As like as two twins. This is amarvellous thing."

"Please, your Majesty," said Shasta to King Edmund, "I was no traitor, really I wasn't.

And I couldn't help hearing your plans. But I'd never have dreamed of telling them toyour enemies."

"I know now that you were no traitor, boy," said King Edmund, laying his hand onShasta's head. "But if you would not be taken for one, another time try not to hear what'smeant for other ears. But all's well."

After that there was so much bustle and talk and coming and going that Shasta for a fewminutes lost sight of Corin and Edmund and Lucy. But Corin was the sort of boy whomone is sure to hear of pretty soon and it wasn't very long before Shasta heard KingEdmund saying in a loud voice:

"By the Lion's Mane, prince, this is too much! Will your Highness never be better? Youare more of a heart's-scald than our whole army together! I'd as lief have a regiment ofhornets in my command as you."

Shasta wormed his way through the crowd and there saw Edmund, looking very angryindeed, Corin looking a little ashamed of himself, and a strange Dwarf sitting on theground making faces. A couple of fauns had apparently just been helping it out of itsarmour.

"If I had but my cordial with me," Queen Lucy was saying, "I could soon mend this. Butthe High King has so strictly charged me not to carry it commonly to the wars and tokeep it only for great extremities!"

What had happened was this. As soon as Corin had spoken to Shasta, Corin's elbow hadbeen plucked by a Dwarf in the army called Thornbut.

"What is it, Thornbut?" Corin had said.

"Your Royal Highness," said Thornbut, drawing him aside, "our march today will bringus through the pass and right to your royal father's castle. We may be in battle beforenight."

"I know," said Corin. "Isn't it splendid!"

"Splendid or not," said Thornbut, "I have the strictest orders from King Edmund to see toit that your Highness is not in the fight. You will be allowed to see it, and that's treatenough for your Highness's little years."

"Oh what nonsense!" Corin burst out. "Of course I'm going to fight. Why, the QueenLucy's going to be with the archers."

"The Queen's grace will do as she pleases," said Thornbut. "But you are in my charge.

Either I must have your solemn and princely word that you'll keep your pony beside mine- not half a neck ahead - till I give your Highness leave to depart: or else - it is hisMajesty's word - we must go with our wrists tied together like two prisoners."

"I'll knock you down if you try to bind me," said Corm.

"I'd like to see your Highness do it," said the Dwarf.

That was quite enough for a boy like Corin and in a second he and the Dwarf were at ithammer and tongs. It would have been an even match for, though Corin had longer armsand more height, the Dwarf was older and tougher. But it was never fought out (that's theworst of fights on a rough hillside) for by very bad luck Thornbut trod on a loose stone,came flat down on his nose, and found when he tried to get up that he had sprained hisankle: a real excruciating sprain which would keep him from walking or riding for atleast a fortnight.

"See what your Highness has done," said King Edmund. "Deprived us of a provedwarrior on the very edge of battle."

"I'll take his place, Sire," said Corin.

"Pshaw," said Edmund. "No one doubts your courage. But a boy in battle is a danger onlyto his own side."

At that moment the King was called away to attend to something else, and Corin, afterapologizing handsomely to the Dwarf, rushed up to Shasta and whispered,

"Quick. There's a spare pony now, and the Dwarf's armour. Put it on before anyonenotices."

"What for?" said Shasta.

"Why, so that you and I can fight in the battle of course! Don't you want to?"

"Oh - ah, yes, of course," said Shasta. But he hadn't been thinking of doing so at all, andbegan to get a most uncomfortable prickly feeling in his spine.

"That's right," said Corin. "Over your head. Now the sword-belt. But we must ride nearthe tail of the column and keep as quiet as mice. Once the battle begins everyone will befar too busy to notice us."
