title: CHAPTER 13. THE FIGHT AT ANVARD
---

By about eleven o'clock the whole company was once more on the march, ridingwestward with the mountains on their left. Corin and Shasta rode right at the rear with theGiants immediately in front of them. Lucy and Edmund and Peridan were busy with theirplans for the battle and though Lucy once said, "But where is his goosecap Highness?"Edmund only replied, "Not in the front, and that's good news enough. Leave well alone."

Shasta told Corin most of his adventures and explained that he had learned all his ridingfrom a horse and didn't really know how to use the reins. Corin instructed him in this,besides telling him all about their secret sailing from Tashbaan.

"And where is the Queen Susan?"

"At Cair Paravel," said Corin. "She's not like Lucy, you know, who's as good as a man, orat any rate as good as a boy. Queen Susan is more like an ordinary grown-up lady. Shedoesn't ride to the wars, though she is an excellent archer."

The hillside path which they were following became narrower all the time and the dropon their right hand became steeper. At last they were going in single file along the edgeof a precipice and Shasta shuddered to think that he had done the same last night withoutknowing it. "But of course," he thought, "I was quite safe. That is why the Lion kept onmy left. He was between me and the edge all the time."

Then the path went left and south away from the cliff and there were thick woods on bothsides of it and they went steeply up and up into the pass. There would have been asplendid view from the top if it were open ground but among all those trees you could seenothing - only, every now and then, some huge pinnacle of rock above the tree-tops, andan eagle or two wheeling high up in the blue air.

"They smell battle," said Corin, pointing at the birds. "They know we're preparing a feedfor them."

Shasta didn't like this at all.

When they had crossed the neck of the pass and come a good deal lower they reachedmore open ground and from here Shasta could see all Archenland, blue and hazy, spread

out below him and even (he thought) a hint of the desert beyond it. But the sun, whichhad perhaps two hours or so to go before it set, was in his eyes and he couldn't makethings out distinctly.

Here the army halted and spread out in a line, and there was a great deal of rearranging. Awhole detachment of very dangerous-looking Talking Beasts whom Shasta had notnoticed before and who were mostly of the cat kind (leopards, panthers, and the like)went padding and growling to take up their positions on the left. The giants were orderedto the right, and before going there they all took off something they had been carrying ontheir backs and sat down for a moment. Then Shasta saw that what they had beencarrying and were now putting on were pairs of boots: horrid, heavy, spiked boots whichcame up to their knees. Then they sloped their huge clubs over their shoulders andmarched to their battle position. The archers, with Queen Lucy, fell to the rear and youcould first see them bending their bows and then hear the twangtwang as they tested thestrings. And wherever you looked you could see people tightening girths, putting onhelmets, drawing swords, and throwing cloaks to the ground. There was hardly anytalking now. It was very solemn and very dreadful. "I'm in for it now - I really am in for itnow," thought Shasta. Then there came noises far ahead: the sound of many menshouting and a steady thud-thud-thud

"Battering ram," whispered Corin. "They're battering the gate."

Even Corin looked quite serious now.

"Why doesn't King Edmund get on?" he said. "I can' stand this waiting about. Chilly too."

Shasta nodded: hoping he didn't look as frightened as felt.

The trumpet at last! On the move now - now trotting the banner streaming out in thewind. They had topped low ridge now, and below them the whole scene sudden openedout; a little, many-towered castle with its gate towards them. No moat, unfortunately, butof course the gate shut and the portcullis down. On the walls they could see, like littlewhite dots, the faces of the defenders. Down below, about fifty of the Calormenes,dismounted, were steadily swinging a great tree trunk against the gate. But at once thescene changed. The main bulk of Rabadash's men had been on foot ready to assault thegate. But now he had seen the Narnians sweeping down from the ridge. There is no doubtthose Calormenes are wonderfully trained. It seemed to Shasta only a second before awhole line of the enemy were on horseback again, wheeling round to meet them,swinging towards them.

And now a gallop. The ground between the two armies grew less every moment. Faster,faster. All swords out now, all shields up to the nose, all prayers said, all teeth clenched.

Shasta was dreadfully frightened. But it suddenly came into his head, "If you funk this,you'll funk every battle all your life. Now or never."

But when at last the two lines met he had really very littler idea of what happened. Therewas a frightful confusion`; and an appalling noise. His sword was knocked clean out ofhis hand pretty soon. And he'd got the reins tangled somehow. Then he found himselfslipping. Then a spear came straight at him and as he ducked to avoid it he rolled right offhis horse, bashed his left knuckles terribly against someone else's armour, and then - Butit is no use trying to describe the battle from Shasta's point of view; he understood toolittle of the fight in general and even of his own part in it. The best way I can tell youwhat really happened is to take you some miles away to where the Hermit of the SouthernMarch sat gazing into the smooth pool beneath the spreading tree, with Bree and Hwinand Aravis beside him.

For it was in this pool that the Hermit looked when he wanted to know what was goingon in the world outside the green walls of his hermitage. There, as in a mirror, he couldsee, at certain times, what was going on in the streets of cities far farther south thanTashbaan, or what ships were putting into Redhaven in the remote Seven Isles, or whatrobbers or wild beasts stirred in the great Western forests between Lantern Waste andTelmar. And all this day he had hardly left his pool, even to eat or drink, for he knew thatgreat events were on foot in Archenland. Aravis and the Horses gazed into it too. Theycould see it was a magic pool: instead of reflecting the tree and the sky it revealed cloudyand coloured shapes moving, always moving, in its depths. But they could see nothingclearly. The Hermit could and from time to time he told them what he saw. A little whilebefore Shasta rode into his first battle, the Hermit had begun speaking like this:

"I see one - two - three eagles wheeling in the gap by Stormness Head. One is the oldestof all the eagles. He would not be out unless battle was at hand. I see him wheel to andfro, peering down sometimes at Anvard and sometimes to the east, behind Stormness. Ah- I see now what Rabadash and his men have been so busy at all day. They have felledand lopped a great tree and they are now coming out of the woods carrying it as a ram.

They have learned something from the failure of last night's assult. He would have beenwiser if he had set his men to making ladders: but it takes too long and he is impatient.

Fool that he is! He ought to have ridden back to Tashbaan as soon as the first attackfailed, for his whole plan depended on speed and surprise. Now they are bringing theirram into position. King Lune's men are shooting hard from the walls. Five Calormeneshave fallen: but not many will. They have their shields above their heads. Rabadash isgiving his orders now. With him are his most trusted lords, fierce Tarkaans from theeastern provinces. I can see their faces. There is Corradin of Castle Tormunt, and Azrooh,and Chlamash, and Ilgamuth of the twisted lip, and a tall Tarkaan with a crimson beard -"

"By the Mane, my old master Anradin!" said Bree.

"S-s-sly" said Aravis.

"Now the ram has started. If I could hear as well as see, what a noise that would make!

Stroke after stroke: and no gate can stand it for ever. But wait! Something up byStormness has scared the birds. They're coming out in masses. And wait again . . . I can'tsee yet . . . ah! Now I can. The whole ridge, up on the east, is black with horsemen. If

only the wind would catch that standard and spread it out. They're over the ridge now,whoever they are. Aha! I've seen the banner now. Narnia, Narnia! It's the red lion.

They're in full career down the hill now. I can see King Edmund. There's a womanbehind among the archers. Oh! -"

"What is it?" asked Hwin breathlessly.

"All his Cats are dashing out from the left of the line."

"Cats?" said Aravis.

"Great cats, leopards and such," said the Hermit impatiently. "I see, I see. The Cats arecoming round in a circle to get at the horses of the dismounted men. A good stroke. TheCalormene horses are mad with terror already. Now the Cats are in among them. ButRabadash has reformed his line and has a hundred men in the saddle. They're riding tomeet the Narnians. There's only a hundred yards between the two lines now. Only fifty. Ican see King Edmund, I can see the Lord Peridan. There are two mere children in theNarnian line. What can the King be about to let them into battle? Only ten yards - thelines have met. The Giants on the Narnian right are doing wonders . . . but one's down . . .

shot through the eye, I suppose. The centre's all in a muddle. I can see more on the left.

There are the two boys again. Lion alive! one is Prince Corm. The other, like him as twopeas. It's your little Shasta. Corm is fighting like a man. He's killed a Calormene. I 'cansee a bit of the centre now. Rabadash and Edmund almost met then, but the press hasseparated them -"

"What about Shasta?" said Aravis.

"Oh the fool!" groaned the Hermit. "Poor, brave little fool. He knows nothing about thiswork. He's making no use at all of his shield. His whole side's exposed. He hasn't thefaintest idea what to do with his sword. Oh, he's remembered it now. He's waving itwildly about . . . nearly cut his own pony's head off, and he will in a moment if he's notcareful. It's been knocked out of his hand now. It's mere murder sending a child into thebattle; he can't live five minutes. Duck you fool - oh, he's down."

"Killed?" asked three voices breathlessly.

"How can I tell?" said the Hermit. "The Cats have done their work. All the riderlesshorses are dead or escaped now: no retreat for the Calormenes on them. Now the Cats areturning back into the main battle. They're leaping on the rams-men. The ram is down. Oh,good! good! The gates are opening from the inside: there's going to be a sortie. The firstthree are out. It's King Lune in the middle: the brothers Dar and Darrin on each side ofhim. Behind them are Tran and Shar and Cole with his brother Colin. There are ten -

twenty - nearly thirty of them out by now. The Calormen line is being forced back uponthem. King Edmund is dealing marvellous strokes. He's just slashed Corradin's head off.

Lots of Calormenes have thrown down their arms and are running for the woods. Thosethat remain are hard pressed. The Giants are closing in on the right - Cats on the left -

King Lune from their rear. The Calormenes are a little knot now, fighting back to back.

Your Tarkaan's down, Bree. Lune and Azrooh are fighting hand to hand; the King lookslike winning - the King is keeping it up well - the King has won. Azrooh's down. KingEdmund's down - no, he's up again: he's at it with Rabadash. They're fighting in the verygate of the castle. Several Calormenes have surrendered. Darrin has killed Ilgamuth. Ican't see what's happened to Rabadash. I think he's dead, leaning against the castle wall,but I don't know. Chlamash and King Edmund are still fighting but the battle is overeverywhere else. Chlamash has surrendered. The battle is over. The Calormenes areutterly defeated."

When Shasta fell off his horse he gave himself up for lost. But horses, even in battle,tread on human beings very much less than you would suppose. After a very horrible tenminutes or so Shasta realized suddenly that there were no longer any horses stampingabout in the immediate neighbourhood and that the noise (for there were still a goodmany noises going on) was no longer that of a battle. He sat up and stared about him.

Even he, little as he knew of battles, could soon see that the Archenlanders and Narnianshad won. The only living Calormenes he could see were prisoners, the castle gates werewide open, and King Lune and King Edmund were shaking hands across the batteringram. From the circle of lords and warriors around them there arose a sound of breathlessand excited, but obviously cheerful conversation. And then, suddenly, it all united andswelled into a great roar of laughter.

Shasta. picked himself up, feeling uncommonly stiff, and ran towards the sound to seewhat the joke was. A very curious sight met his eyes. The unfortunate Rabadash appearedto be suspended from the castle walls. His feet, which were about two feet from theground, were kicking wildly. His chain-shirt was somehow hitched up so that it washorribly tight under the arms and came half way over his face. In fact he looked just as aman looks if you catch him in the very act of getting into a stiff shirt that is a little toosmall for him. As far as could be made out afterwards (and you may be sure the story waswell talked over for many a day) what happened was something like this. Early in thebattle one of the Giants had made an unsuccessful stamp at Rabadash with his spikedboot: unsuccessful because it didn't crush Rabadash, which was what the Giant hadintended, but not quite useless because one of the spikes tore the chain mail, just as youor I might tear an ordinary shirt. So Rabadash, by the time he encountered Edmund at thegate, had a hole in the back of his hauberk. And when Edmund pressed him back nearerand nearer to the wall, he jumped up on a mounting block and stood there raining downblows on Edmund from above. But then, finding that this position, by raising him abovethe heads of everyone else, made him a mark for every arrow from the Narnian bows, hedecided to jump down again. And he meant to look and sound - no doubt for a momenthe did look and sound - very grand and very dreadful as he jumped, crying, "The bolt ofTash falls from above." But he had to jump sideways because the crowd in front of himleft him no landing place in that direction. And then, in the neatest way you could wish,the tear in the back of his hauberk caught on a hook in the wall. (Ages ago this hook hadhad a ring in it for tying horses to.) And there he found himself, like a piece of washinghung up to dry, with everyone laughing at him.

"Let me down, Edmund," howled Rabadash. "Let me down and fight me like a king and aman; or if you are too great a coward to do that, kill me at once."

"Certainly," began King Edmund, but King Lune interrupted.

"By your Majesty's good leave," said King Lune to Edmund. "Not so." Then turning toRabadash he said, "Your royal Highness, if you had given that challenge a week ago, I'llanswer for it there was no one in King Edmund's dominion, from the High King down tothe smallest Talking Mouse, who would have refused it. But by attacking our castle ofAnvard in time of peace without defiance sent, you have proved yourself no knight, but atraitor, and one rather to be whipped by the hangman than to be suffered to cross swordswith any person of honour. Take him down, bind him, and carry him within till ourpleasure is further known."

Strong hands wrenched Rabadash's sword from him and he was carried away into thecastle, shouting, threatening, cursing, and even crying. For though he could have facedtorture he couldn't bear being made ridiculous. In Tashbaan everyone had always takenhim seriously.

At that moment Corin ran up to Shasta, seized his hand and started dragging him towardsKing Lune. "Here he is, Father, here he is," cried Corin.

"Aye, and here thou art, at last," said the King in a very gruff voice. "And bast been in thebattle, clean contrary to your obedience. A boy to break a father's heart! At your age a rodto your breech were fitter than a sword in your fist, ha!" But everyone, including Corin,could see that the King was very proud of him.

"Chide him no more, Sire, if it please you," said Lord Darrin. "His Highness would not beyour son if he did not inherit your conditions. It would grieve your Majesty more if hehad to be reproved for the opposite fault."

"Well, well," grumbled the King. "We'll pass it over for this time. And now -" '

What came next surprised Shasta as much as anything that had ever happened to him inhis life. He found himself suddenly embraced inn bear-like hug by King Lune and kissedon both cheeks. Then the King set him down again and said, "Stand here together, boys,and let all the court see you. Hold up your heads. Now, gentlemen, look on them both.

Has any man any doubts?"

And still Shasta could not understand why everyone stared at him and at Corin nor whatall the cheering was about.
