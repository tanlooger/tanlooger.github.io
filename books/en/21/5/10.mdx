title: CHAPTER 10. THE HERMIT OF THE SOUTHERN MARCH
---

AFTER they had ridden for several hours down the valley, it widened out and they couldsee what was ahead of them. The river which they had been following here joined abroader river, wide and turbulent, which flowed from their left to their right, towards theeast. Beyond this new river a delightful country rose gently in low hills, ridge beyondridge, to the Northern Mountains themselves. To the right there were rocky pinnacles,one or two of them with snow clinging to the ledges. To the left, pine-clad slopes,frowning cliffs, narrow gorges, and blue peaks stretched away as far as the eye couldreach. He could no longer make out Mount Pire. Straight ahead the mountain range sankto a wooded saddle which of course must be the pass from Archenland into Narnia.

"Broo-hoo-hoo, the North, the green North!" neighed Bree: and certainly the lower hillslooked greener and fresher than anything that Aravis and Shasta, with their southern-bredeyes, had ever imagined. Spirits rose as they clattered down to the water's-meet of thetwo rivers.

The eastern-flowing river, which was pouring from the higher mountains at the westernend of the range, was far too swift and too broken with rapids for them to think ofswimming it; but after some casting about, up and down the bank, they found a placeshallow enough to wade. The roar and clatter of water, the great swirl against the horses'fetlocks, the cool, stirring air and the darting dragon-flies, filled Shasta with a strangeexcitement.

"Friends, we are in Archenland!" said Bree proudly as he splashed and churned his wayout on the Northern bank. "I think that river we've just crossed is called the WindingArrow."

"I hope we're in time," murmured Hwin.

Then they began going up, slowly and zigzagging a good deal, for the hills were steep. Itwas all open park-like country with no roads or houses in sight. Scattered trees, neverthick enough to be a forest, were everywhere. Shasta, who had lived all his life in analmost tree-less grassland, had never seen so many or so many kinds. If you had beenthere you would probably have known (he didn't) that he was seeing oaks, beeches, silverbirches, rowans, and sweet chestnuts. Rabbits scurried away in every direction as theyadvanced, and presently they saw a whole herd of fallow deer making off among thetrees.

"Isn't it simply glorious!" said Aravis.

At the first ridge Shasta turned in the saddle and looked back. There was no sign ofTashbaan; the desert, unbroken except by the narrow green crack which they hadtravelled down, spread to the horizon.

"Hullo!" he said suddenly. "What's that!"

"What's what?" said Bree, turning round. Hwin and Aravis did the same.

"That," said Shasta, pointing. "It looks like smoke. Is it a fire?"

"Sand-storm, I should say," said Bree.

"Not much wind to raise it," said Aravis.

"Oh!" exclaimed Hwin. "Look! There are things flashing in it. Look! They're helmets -

and armour. And it's moving: moving this way."

"By Tash!" said Aravis. "It's the army. It's Rabadash."

"Oh course it is," said Hwin. "Just what I was afraid of. Quick! We must get to Anvardbefore it." And without another word she whisked round and began galloping North. Breetossed his head and did the same.

"Come on, Bree, come on," yelled Aravis over her shoulder.

The race was very gruelling for the Horses. As they topped each ridge they found anothervalley and another ridge beyond it; and though they knew they were going in more or lessthe right direction, no one knew how far it was to Anvard. From the top of the secondridge Shasta looked back again. Instead of a dust-cloud well out in the desert he now sawa black, moving mass, rather like ants, on the far bank of the Winding Arrow. They weredoubtless looking for a ford.

"They're on the river!" he yelled wildly.

"Quick! Quick!" shouted Aravis. "We might as well not have come at all if we don'treach Anvard in time. Gallop, Bree, gallop. Remember you're a war-horse."

It was all Shasta could do to prevent himself from shouting out similar instructions; buthe thought, "The poor chap's doing all he can already," and held his tongue. And certainlyboth Horses were doing, if not all they could, all they thought they could; which is notquite the same thing. Bree had caught up with Hwin and they thundered side by side overthe turf. It didn't look as if Hwin could possibly keep it up much longer.

At that moment everyone's feelings were completely altered by a sound from behind. Itwas not the sound they had been expecting to hear - the noise of hoofs and jinglingarmour, mixed, perhaps, with Calormene battle-cries. Yet Shasta knew it at once. It wasthe same snarling roar he had heard that moonlit night when they first met Aravis andHwin. Bree knew it too. His eyes gleamed red and his ears lay flat back on his skull. AndBree now discovered that he had not really been going as fast - not quite as fast - as hecould. Shasta felt the change at once. Now they were really going all out. In a fewseconds they were well ahead of Hwin.

"It's not fair," thought Shasta. "I did think we'd be safe from lions here!"

He looked over his shoulder. Everything was only too clear. A huge tawny creature, itsbody low to the ground, like a cat streaking across the lawn to a tree when a strange doghas got into the garden, was behind them. And it was nearer every second and halfsecond.

He looked forward again and saw something which he did not take in, or even thinkabout. Their way was barred by a smooth green wall about ten feet high. In the middle ofthat wall there was a gate, open. In the middle of the gateway stood a tall man dressed,down to his bare feet, in a robe coloured like autumn leaves, leaning on a straight staff.

His beard fell almost to his knees.

Shasta saw all this in a glance and looked back again. The lion had almost got Hwin now.

It was making snaps at her hind legs, and there was no hope now in her foamflecked,wide-eyed face.

"Stop," bellowed Shasta in Bree's ear. "Must go back. Must help!"

Bree always said afterwards that he never heard, or never understood this; and as he wasin general a very truthful horse we must accept his word.

Shasta slipped his feet out of the stirrups, slid both his legs over the left side, hesitated forone hideous hundredth of a second, and jumped. It hurt horribly and nearly winded him;but before he knew how it hurt him he was staggering back to help Aravis. He had neverdone anything like this in his life before and hardly knew why he was doing it now.

One of the most terrible noises in the world, a horse's scream, broke from Hwin's lips.

Aravis was stooping low over Hwin's neck and seemed to be trying to draw her sword.

And now all three - Aravis, Hwin, and the lion were almost on top of Shasta. Before theyreached him the lion rose on its hind legs, larger than you would have believed a lioncould be, and jabbed at Aravis with its right paw. Shasta could see all the terrible clawsextended. Aravis screamed and reeled in the saddle. The lion was tearing her shoulders.

Shasta, half mad with horror, managed to lurch towards the brute. He had no weapon, noteven a stick or a stone. He shouted out, idiotically, at the lion as one would at a dog. "Gohome! Go home!" For a fraction of a second he was staring right into its wideopened,

raging mouth. Then, to his utter astonishment, the lion, still on its hind legs, checkeditself suddenly, turned head over heels, picked itself up, and rushed away.

Shasta did not for a moment suppose it had gone for good. He turned and raced for thegate in the green wall which, now for the first time, he remembered seeing. Hwin,stumbling and nearly fainting, was just entering the gate: Aravis still kept her seat but herback was covered with blood.

"Come in, my daughter, come in," the robed and bearded man was saying, and then"Come in, my son" as Shasta panted up to him. He heard the gate closed behind him; andthe bearded stranger was already helping Aravis off her horse.

They were in a wide and perfectly circular enclosure, protected by a high wall of greenturf. A pool of perfectly still water, so full that the water was almost exactly level withthe ground, lay before him. At one end of the pool, completely overshadowing it with itsbranches, there grew the hugest and most beautiful tree that Shasta had ever seen. Beyondthe pool was a little low house of stone roofed with deep and ancient thatch. There was asound of bleating and over at the far side of the enclosure there were some goats. Thelevel ground was completely covered with the finest grass.

"Are - are - are you," panted Shasta. "Are you King Lune of Archenland?"

The old man shook his head. "No," he replied in a quiet voice, "I am the Hermit of theSouthern March. And now, my son, waste no time on questions, but obey. This damsel iswounded. Your horses are spent. Rabadash is at this moment finding a ford over theWinding Arrow. If you run now, without a moment's rest, you will still be in time to warnKing Lune."

Shasta's heart fainted at these words for he felt he had no strength left. And he writhedinside at what seemed the cruelty and unfairness of the demand. He had not yet learnedthat if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder andbetter one. But all he said out loud was:

"Where is the King?"

The Hermit turned and pointed with his staff. "Look," he said. "There is another gate,right opposite to the one you entered by. Open it and go straight ahead: always straightahead, over level or steep, over smooth or rough, over dry or wet. I know by my art thatyou will find King Lune straight ahead. But run, run: always run."

Shasta nodded his head, ran to the northern gate and disappeared beyond it. Then theHermit took Aravis, whom he had all this time been supporting with his left arm, and halfled, half carried her into the house. After a long time he came out again.

"Now, cousins," he said to the Horses. "It is your turn."

Without waiting for an answer - and indeed they were too exhausted to speak - he tookthe bridles and saddles off both of them. Then he rubbed them both down, so well that agroom in a King's stable could not have done it better.

"There, cousins," he said, "dismiss it all from your minds and be comforted. Here is waterand there is grass. You shall have a hot mash when I have milked my other cousins, thegoats."

"Sir," said Hwin, finding her voice at last, "will the Tarkheena live? Has the lion killedher?"

"I who know many present things by my art," replied the Hermit with a smile, "have yetlittle knowledge of things future. Therefore I do not know whether any man or woman orbeast in the whole world will be alive when the sun sets tonight. But be of good hope.

The damsel is likely to live as long as any of her age."

When Aravis came to herself she found that she was lying on her face on a low bed ofextraordinary softness in a cool, bare room with walls of undressed stone. She couldn'tunderstand why she had been laid on her face; but when she tried to turn and felt the hot,burning pains all over her back, she remembered, and realized why. She couldn'tunderstand what delightfully springy stuff the bed was made of, because it was made ofheather (which is the best bedding) and heather was a thing she had never seen or heardof.

The door opened and the Hermit entered, carrying a large wooden bowl in his hand. Aftercarefully setting this down, he came to the bedside, and asked:

"How do you find yourself, my daughter?"

"My back is very sore, father," said Aravis, "but there is nothing else wrong with me."

He knelt beside her, laid his hand on her forehead, and felt her pulse.

"There is no fever," he said. "You will do well. Indeed there is no reason why you shouldnot get up tomorrow. But now, drink this."

He fetched the wooden bowl and held it to her lips. Aravis couldn't help making a facewhen she tasted it, for goats' milk is rather a shock when you are not used to it. But shewas very thirsty and managed to drink it all and felt better when she had finished.

"Now, my daughter, you may sleep when you wish," said the Hermit. "For your woundsare washed and dressed and though they smart they are no more serious than if they hadbeen the cuts of a whip. It must have been a very strange lion; for instead-of catching youout of the saddle and getting his teeth into you, he has only drawn his claws across yourback. Ten scratches: sore, but not deep or dangerous."

"I say!" said Aravis. "I have had luck."

"Daughter," said the Hermit, "I have now lived a hundred and nine winters in this worldand have never yet met any such thing as Luck. Them is something about all this that I donot understand: but if ever we need to know it, you may be sure that we shall."

"And what about Rabadash and his two hundred horse?" asked Aravis.

"They will not pass this way, I think," said the Hermit. "They must have found a ford bynow well to the east of us. From there they will try to ride straight to Anvard."

"Poor Shasta!" said Aravis. "Has he far to go? Will he get there first?"

"There is good hope of it," said the old man.

Aravis lay down again (on her side this time) and said, "Have I been asleep for a longtime? It seems to be getting dark."

The Hermit was looking out of the only window, which faced north. "This is not thedarkness of night," he said presently. "The clouds are falling down from Stormness Head.

Our foul weather always comes from there in these parts. There will be thick fogtonight."

Next day, except for her sore back, Aravis felt so well that after breakfast (which wasporridge and cream) the Hermit said she could get up. And of course she at once went outto speak to the Horses. The weather had changed and the whole of that green enclosurewas filled, like a great green cup, with sunlight. It was a very peaceful place, lonely andquiet.

Hwin at once trotted across to Aravis and gave her a horse-kiss.

"But where's Bree?" said Aravis when each had asked after the other's health and sleep.

"Over there," said Hwin, pointing with her nose to the far side of the circle. "And I wishyou'd come and talk to him. There's something wrong, I can't get a word out of him."

They strolled across and found Bree lying with his face towards the wall, and though hemust have heard them coming, he never turned his head or spoke a word.

"Good morning, Bree," said Aravis. "How are you this morning?"

Bree muttered something that no one could hear.

"The Hermit says that Shasta probably got to King Lune in time," continued Aravis, "so itlooks as if all our troubles are over. Narnia, at last, Bree!"

"I shall never see Narnia," said Bree in a low voice.

"Aren't you well, Bree dear?" said Aravis.

Bree turned round at last, his face mournful as only a horse's can be.

"I shall go back to Calormen," he said.

"What?" said Aravis. "Back to slavery!"

"Yes," said Bree. "Slavery is all I'm fit for. How can I ever show my face among the freeHorses of Narnia? - I who left a mare and a girl and a boy to be eaten by lions while Igalloped all I could to save my own wretched skin!"

"We all ran as hard as we could," said Hwin.

"Shasta didn't!" snorted Bree. "At least he ran in the right direction: ran back. And that iswhat shames me most of all. I, who called myself a war-horse and boasted of a hundredfights, to be beaten by a little human boy - a child, a mere foal, who had never held asword nor had any good nurture or example in his life!"

"I know," said Aravis. "I felt just the same. Shasta was marvellous. I'm just as bad as you,Bree. I've been snubbing him and looking down on him ever since you met us and nowhe turns out to be the best of us all. But I think it would be better to stay and say we'resorry than to go back to Calormen."

"It's all very well for you," said Bree. "You haven't disgraced yourself. But I've losteverything."

"My good Horse," said the Hermit, who had approached them unnoticed because his barefeet made so little noise on that sweet, dewy grass. "My good Horse, you've lost nothingbut your self-conceit. No, no, cousin. Don't put back your ears and shake your mane atme. If you are really so humbled as you sounded a minute ago, you must learn to listen tosense. You're not quite the great Horse you had come to think, from living among poordumb horses. Of course you were braver and cleverer than them. You could hardly helpbeing that. It doesn't follow that you'll be anyone very special in Narnia. But as long asyou know you're nobody special, you'll be a very decent sort of Horse, on the whole, andtaking one thing with another. And now, if you and my other four-footed cousin willcome round to the kitchen door we'll see about the other half of that mash."
