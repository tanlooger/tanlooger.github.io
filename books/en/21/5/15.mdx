title: CHAPTER 15. RABADASH THE RIDICULOUS
---

THE next turn of the road- brought them out from among the trees and there, acrossgreen lawns, sheltered from the north wind by the high wooded ridge at its back, they sawthe castle of Anvard. It was very old and built of a warm, reddish-brown stone.

Before they had reached the gate King Lune came out to meet them, not looking at alllike Aravis's idea of a king and wearing the oldest of old clothes; for he had just comefrom making a round of the kennels with his Huntsman and had only stopped for amoment to wash his doggy hands. But the bow with which he greeted Aravis as he tookher hand would have been stately enough for an Emperor.

"Little lady," he said, "we bid you very heartily welcome. If my dear wife were still alivewe could make you better cheer but could not do it with a better will. And I am sorry thatyou have had misfortunes and been driven from your father's house, which cannot but bea grief to you. My son Cor has told me about your adventures together and all yourvalour."

"It was he who did all that, Sir," said Aravis. "Why, he rushed at a lion to save me."

"Eh, what's that?" said King Lune, his face brightening. "I haven't heard that part of thestory."

Then Aravis told it. And Cor, who had very much wanted the story to be known, thoughhe felt he couldn't tell it himself, didn't enjoy it so much as he had expected, and indeedfelt rather foolish. But his father enjoyed it very much indeed and in the course of thenext few weeks told it to so many people that Cor wished it had never happened.

Then the King turned to Hwin and Bree and was just as polite to them as to Aravis, andasked them a lot of questions about their families and where they had lived in Narniabefore they had been captured. The Horses were rather tongue-tied for they weren't yetused to being talked to as equals by Humans grown-up Humans, that is. They didn't mindAravis and Cor.

Presently Queen Lucy came out from the castle and joined them and King Lune said toAravis, "My dear, here is a loving friend of our house, and she has been seeing that yourapartments are put to rights for you better than I could have done it."

"You'd like to come and see them, wouldn't you?" said Lucy, kissing Aravis. They likedeach other at once and soon went away together to talk about Aravis's bedroom andAravis's boudoir and about getting clothes for her, and all the sort of things girls do talkabout on such an occasion.

After lunch, which they had on the terrace (it was cold birds and cold game pie and wineand bread and cheese), King Lune ruffled up his brow and heaved a sigh and said,"Heigh-ho! We have still that sorry creature Rabadash on our hands, my friends, andmust needs resolve what to do with him."

Lucy was sitting on the King's right and Aravis on his left. King Edmund sat at one endof the table and the Lord Darrin faced him at the other. Dar and Peridan and Cor andCorin were on the same side as the King.

"Your Majesty would have a perfect right to strike off his head," said Peridan. "Such anassault as he made puts him on a level with assassins."

"It is very true," said Edmund. "But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did."And he looked very thoughtful.

"To kill this Rabadash would go near to raising war with the Tisroc," said Darrin.

"A fig for the Tisroc," said King Lune. "His strength is in numbers and numbers willnever cross the desert. But I have no stomach for killing men (even traitors) in coldblood. To have cut his throat in the battle would have eased my heart mightily, but this isa different thing."

"By my counsel," said Lucy, "your Majesty shall give him another trial. Let him go freeon strait promise of fair dealing in the future. It may be that he will keep his word."

"Maybe Apes will grow honest, Sister," said Edmund. "But, by the Lion, if he breaks itagain, may it be in such time and place that any of us could swap off his head in cleanbattle."

"It shall be tried," said the King: and then to one of the attendants, "Send for the prisoner,friend."

Rabadash was brought before them in chains. To look at him anyone would havesupposed that he had passed the night in a noisome dungeon without food or water; but inreality he had been shut up in quite a comfortable room and provided with an excellentsupper. But as he was sulking far too furiously to touch the supper and had spent thewhole night stamping and roaring and cursing, he naturally did not now look his best.

"Your royal Highness needs not to be told," said King Lune, "that by the law of nationsas well as by all reasons of prudent policy, we have as good right to your head as everone mortal man had against another. Nevertheless, in consideration of your youth and theill nurture, devoid of all gentilesse and courtesy, which you have doubtless had in theland of slaves and tyrants, we are disposed to set you free, unharmed, on these conditions:first, that-"

"Curse you for a barbarian dog!" spluttered Rabadash. "Do you think I will even hearyour conditions? Faugh! You talk very largely of nurture and I know not what. It's easy,to a man in chains, ha! Take off these vile bonds, give me a sword, and let any of youwho dares then debate with me."

Nearly all the lords sprang to their feet, and Corin shouted:

"Father! Can I box him? Please."

"Peace! Your Majesties! My Lords!" said King Lune. "Have we no more gravity amongus than to be so chafed by the taunt of a pajock? Sit down, Corin, or shaft leave the table.

I ask your Highness again, to hear our conditions."

"I hear no conditions from barbarians and sorcerers," said Rabadash. "Not one of youdare touch a hair of my head. Every insult you have heaped on me shall be paid withoceans of Narnian and Archenlandish blood. Terrible shall the vengeance of the Tisrocbe: even now. But kill me, and the burnings and torturings in these northern lands shallbecome a tale to frighten the world a thousand years hence. Beware! Beware! Beware!

The bolt of Tash falls from above!"

"Does it ever get caught on a hook half-way?" asked Corin.

"Shame, Corin," said the King. "Never taunt a man save when he is stronger than you:then, as you please."

"Oh you foolish Rabadash," sighed Lucy.

Next moment Cor wondered why everyone at the table had risen and was standingperfectly still. Of course he did the same himself. And then he saw the reason. Aslan wasamong them though no one had seen him coming. Rabadash started as the immense shapeof the Lion paced softly in between him and his accusers.

"Rabadash," said Aslan. "Take heed. Your doom is very near, but you may still avoid it.

Forget your pride (what have you to be proud of?) and your anger (who has done youwrong?) and accept the mercy of these good kings."

Then Rabadash rolled his eyes and spread out his mouth into a horrible, long mirthlessgrin like a shark, and wagged his ears up and down (anyone can learn how to do this ifthey take the trouble). He had always found this very effective in Calormen. The bravesthad trembled when he made these faces, and ordinary people had fallen to the floor, andsensitive people had often fainted. But what Rabadash hadn't realized is that it is veryeasy to frighten people who know you can have them boiled alive the moment you givethe word. The grimaces didn't look at all alarming in Archenland; indeed Lucy onlythought Rabadash was going to be sick.

"Demon! Demon! Demon!" shrieked the Prince. "I know you. You are the foul fiend ofNarnia. You are the enemy of the gods. Learn who I am, horrible phantasm. I amdescended from Tash, the inexorable, the irresistible. the curse of Tash is upon you.

Lightning in the shape of scorpions shall be rained on you. The mountains of Narnia shallbe ground into dust. The-"

"Have a care, Rabadash," said Aslan quietly. "The doom is nearer now: it is at the door: ithas lifted the latch."

"Let the skies fall," shrieked Rabadash. "Let the earth gape! Let blood and fire obliteratethe world! But be sure I will never desist till I have dragged to my palace by her hair thebarbarian queen, the daughter of dogs, the -"

"The hour has struck," said Aslan: and Rabadash saw, to his supreme horror, thateveryone had begun to laugh.

They couldn't help it. Rabadash had been wagging his ears all the time and as soon asAslan said, "The hour has struck!" the ears began to change. They grew longer and morepointed and soon were covered with grey hair. And while everyone was wondering wherethey had seen ears like that before, Rabadash's face began to change too. It grew longer,and thicker at the top and larger eyed, and the nose sank back into the face (or else theface swelled out and became all nose) and there was hair all over it. And his arms grewlonger and came down in front of him till his hands were resting on the ground: only theyweren't hands, now, they were hoofs. And he was standing on all fours, and his clothesdisappeared, and everyone laughed louder and louder (because they couldn't help it) fornow what had been Rabadash was, simply and unmistakably, a donkey. The terrible thingwas that his human speech lasted just a moment longer than his human shape, so thatwhen he realized the change that was coming over him, he screamed out:

"Oh, not a Donkey! Mercy! If it were even a horse - e'en - a hor - eeh - auh, eeh-auh."And so the words died away into a donkey's bray.

"Now hear me, Rabadash," said Aslan. "Justice shall be mixed with mercy. You shall notalways be an Ass."

At this of course the Donkey twitched its ears forward and that also was so funny thateverybody laughed all the more. They tried not to, but they tried in vain.

"You have appealed to Tash," said Aslan. "And in the temple of Tash you shall be healed.

You must stand before the altar of Tash in Tashbaan at the great Autumn Feast this yearand there, in the sight of all Tashbaan, your ass's shape will fall from you and all menwill know you for Prince Rabadash. But as long as you live, if ever you go more than tenmiles away from the great temple in Tashbaan you shall instantly become again as younow are. And from that second change there will be no return."

There was a short silence and then they all stirred and looked at one another as if theywere waking from sleep. Aslan was gone. But there was a brightness in the air and on thegrass, and a joy in their hearts, which assured them that he had been no dream: andanyway, there was the donkey in front of them.

King Lune was the kindest-hearted of men and on seeing his enemy in this regrettablecondition he forgot all his anger.

"Your royal Highness," he said. "I am most truly sorry that things have come to thisextremity. Your Highness will bear witness that it was none of our doing. And of coursewe shall be delighted to provide your Highness with shipping back to Tashbaan for the -

er - treatment which Aslan has prescribed. You shall have every comfort which yourHighness's situation allows: the best of the cattleboats - the freshest carrots and thistles -"

But a deafening bray from the Donkey and a well-aimed kick at one of the guards made itclear that these kindly offers were ungratefully received.

And here, to get him out of the way, I'd better finish off the story of Rabadash. He (or it)was duly sent back by boat to Tashbaan and brought into the temple of Tash at the greatAutumn Festival, and then he became a man again. But of course four or five thousandpeople had seen the transformation and the affair could not possibly be hushed up. Andafter the old Tisroc's death when Rabadash became Tisroc in his place he turned out themost peaceable Tisroc Calormen had ever known. This was because, not daring to gomore than ten miles from Tashbaan, he could never go on a war himself: and he didn'twant his Tarkaans to win fame in the wars at his expense, for that is the way Tisrocs getoverthrown. But though his reasons were selfish, it made things much more comfortablefor all the smaller countries round Calormen. His own people never forgot that he hadbeen a donkey. During his reign, and to his face, he was called Rabadash the Peacemaker,but after his death and behind his back he was called Rabadash the Ridiculous, and if youlook him up in a good History of Calormen (try the local library) you will find him underthat name. And to this day in Calormene schools, if you do anything unusually stupid,you are very likely to be called "a second Rabadash".

Meanwhile at Anvard everyone was very glad that he had been disposed of before thereal fun began, which was a grand feast held that evening on the lawn before the castle,with dozens of lanterns to help the moonlight. And the wine flowed and tales were toldand jokes were cracked, and then silence was made and the King's poet with two fiddlersstepped out into the middle of the circle. Aravis and Cor prepared themselves to be bored,for the only poetry they knew was the Calormene kind, and you know now what that waslike. But at the very first scrape of the fiddles a rocket seemed to go up inside their heads,and the poet sang the great old lay of Fair Olvin and how he fought the Giant Pire andturned him into stone (and that is the origin of Mount Pire - it was a two-headed Giant)and won the Lady Liln for his bride; and when it was over they wished it was going tobegin again. And though Bree couldn't sing he told the story of the fight at Zalindreh.

And Lucy told again (they had all, except Aravis and Cor, heard it many times but theyall wanted it again) the tale of the Wardrobe and how she and King Edmund and QueenSusan and Peter the High King had first come into Narnia.

And presently, as was certain to happen sooner or later, King Lune said if was time foryoung people to be in bed. "And tomorrow, Cor," he added, "shalt come over all thecastle with me and see the estres and mark all its strength and weakness: for it will bethine to guard when I'm gone."

"But Corin will be the King then, Father," said Cor.

"Nay, lad," said King Lune, "thou art my heir. The crown comes to thee."

"But I don't want it," said Cor. "I'd far rather-"

"'Tis no question what thou wantest, Cor, nor I either. 'Tis in the course of law."

"But if we're twins we must be the same age."

"Nay," said the King with a laugh. "One must come first. Art Corin's elder by full twentyminutes. And his better too, let's hope, though that's no great mastery." And he looked atCorin with a twinkle in his eyes.

"But, Father, couldn't you make whichever you like to be the next King?"

"No. The king's under the law, for it's the law makes him a king. Hast no more power tostart away from thy crown than any sentry from his post."

"Oh dear," said Cor. "I don't want to at all. And Corin - I am most dreadfully sorry. Inever dreamed my turning up was going to chisel you out of your kingdom."

"Hurrah! Hurrah!" said Corin. "I shan't have to be King. I shan't have to be King. I'llalways be a prince. It's princes have all the fun."

"And that's truer than thy brother knows, Cor," said King Lune. "For this is what it meansto be a king: to be first in every desperate attack and last in every desperate retreat, andwhen there's hunger in the land (as must be now and then in bad years) to wear finerclothes and laugh louder over a scantier meal than any man in your land."

When the two boys were going upstairs to bed Cor again asked Corin if nothing could bedone about it. And Corin said:

"If you say another word about it, I'll - I'll knock you down."

It would be nice to end the story by saying that after that the two brothers never disagreedabout anything again, but I am afraid it would not be true. In reality they quarrelled andfought just about as often as any other two boys would, and all their fights ended (if theydidn't begin) with Cor getting knocked down. For though, when they had both grown upand become swordsmen, Cor was the more dangerous man in battle, neither he noranyone else in the North Countries could ever equal Corin as a boxer. That was how hegot his name of Corin Thunder-Fist; and how he performed his great exploit against theLapsed Bear of Stormness, which was really a Talking Bear but had gone back to WildBear habits. Corm climbed up to its lair on the Narnian side of Stormness one winter daywhen the snow was on the hills and boxed it without a time-keeper for thirty-threerounds. And at the end it couldn't see out of its eyes and became a reformed character.

Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they alwaysmade it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used toquarrelling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it moreconveniently. And after King Lune's death they made a good King and Queen ofArchenland and Ram the Great, the most famous of all the kings of Archenland, was theirson. Bree and Hwin lived happily to a great age in Narnia and both got married but not toone another. And there weren't many months in which one or both of them didn't cometrotting over the pass to visit their friends at Anvard.
