title: CHAPTER 2. ON BOARD THE DAWN TREADER
---

"AH, there you are, Lucy," said Caspian. "We were just waiting for you. This is mycaptain, the Lord Drinian."

A dark-haired man went down on one knee and kissed her hand. The only others presentwere Reepicheep and Edmund.

"Where is Eustace?" asked Lucy.

"In bed," said Edmund, "and I don't think we can do anything for him. It only makes himworse if you try to be nice to him."

"Meanwhile," said Caspian, "we want to talk."

"By Jove, we do," said Edmund. "And first, about time. It's a year ago by our time sincewe left you just before your coronation. How long has it been in Narnia?"

"Exactly three years," said Caspian.

"All going well?" asked Edmund.

"You don't suppose I'd have left my kingdom and put to sea unless all was well,"answered the King. "It couldn't be better. There's no trouble at all now betweenTelmarines, Dwarfs, Talking Beasts, Fauns and the rest. And we gave those troublesomegiants on the frontier such a good beating last summer that they pay us tribute now. And Ihad an excellent person to leave as Regent while I'm away Trumpkin, the Dwarf. Youremember him?"

"Dear Trumpkin," said Lucy, "of course I do. You couldn't have made a better choice."

"Loyal as a badger, Ma'am, and valiant as - as a Mouse," said Drinian. He had been goingto say "as a lion" but had noticed Reepicheep's eyes fixed on him.

"And where are we heading for?" asked Edmund.

"Well," said Caspian, "that's rather a long story. Perhaps you remember that when I was achild my usurping uncle Miraz got rid of seven friends of my father's (who might havetaken my part) by sending them off to explore the unknown , Eastern Seas beyond theLone Islands."

"Yes," said Lucy, "and none of them ever came back."

"Right. Well, on, my coronation day, with Aslan's approval, I swore an oath that, if once Iestablished peace in Narnia, I would sail east myself for a year and a day to find myfather's friends or to learn of their deaths and avenge them if I could. These were theirnames - the Lord Revilian, the Lord Bern, the Lord Argoz, the Lord Mavramorn, theLord Octesian, the Lord Restimar, and - oh, that other one who's so hard to remember."

"The Lord Rhoop, Sire," said Drinian.

"Rhoop, Rhoop, of course," said Caspian. "That is my main intention. But Reepicheephere has an even higher hope." Everyone's eyes turned to the Mouse.

"As high as my spirit," it said. "Though perhaps as small as my stature. Why should wenot come to the very eastern end of the world? And what might we find there? I expect tofind Aslan's own country. It is always from the east, across the sea, that the great Lioncomes to us."

"I say, that is an idea," said Edmund in an awed voice.

"But do you think," said Lucy, "Aslan's country would be that sort of country - I mean,the sort you could ever sail to?"

"I do not know, Madam," said Reepicheep. "But there is this. When I was in my cradle, awood woman, a Dryad, spoke this verse over me:

"Where sky and water meet, Where the waves grow sweet, Doubt not, Reepicheep, Tofind all you seek, There is the utter East.

"I do not know what it means. But the spell of it has been on me all my life."

After a short silence Lucy asked, "And where are we now, Caspian?"

"The Captain can tell you better than I," said Caspian, so Drinian got out his chart andspread it on the table.

"That's our position," he said, laying his finger on it. "Or was at noon today. We had afair wind from Cair Paravel and stood a little north for Galma, which we made on thenext day. We were in port for a week, for the Duke of Galma made a great tournament forHis Majesty and there he unhorsed many knights-"

"And got a few nasty falls myself, Drinian. Some of the bruises are there still," put inCaspian.

"- And unhorsed many knights," repeated Drinian with a grin. "We thought the Dukewould have been pleased if the King's Majesty would have married his daughter, butnothing came of that-"

"Squints, and has freckles," said Caspian.

"Oh, poor girl," said Lucy.

"And we sailed from Galma," continued Drinian, "and ran into a calm for the best part oftwo days and had to row, and then had wind again and did not make Terebinthia till thefourth day from Galma. And there their King sent out a warning not to land for there wassickness in Terebinthia, but we doubled the cape and put in at a little creek far from thecity and watered. Then we had to lie off for three days before we got a south-east windand stood out for Seven Isles. The third day out a pirate (Terebinthian by her rig)overhauled us, but when she saw us well armed she stood off after some shooting ofarrows on either part -"

"And we ought to have given her chase and boarded her and hanged every mother's sonof them," said Reepicheep.

"- And in five days more we were insight of Muil, which, as you know, is thewesternmost of the Seven Isles. Then we rowed through the straits and came aboutsundown into Redhaven on the isle of Brenn, where we were very lovingly feasted andhad victuals and water at will. We left Redhaven six days ago and have mademarvellously good speed, so that I hope to see the Lone Islands the day after tomorrow.

The sum is, we are now nearly thirty days at sea and have sailed more than four hundredleagues from Narnia."

"And after the Lone Islands?" said Lucy.

"No one knows, your Majesty," answered Drinian. "Unless the Lone Islanders themselvescan tell us."

"They couldn't in our days," said Edmund.

"Then," said Reepicheep, "it is after the Lone Islands that the adventure really begins."

Caspian now suggested that they might like to be shown over the ship before supper, butLucy's conscience smote her and she said, "I think I really must go and see Eustace.

Seasickness is horrid, you know. If I had my old cordial with me I could cure him."

"But you have," said Caspian. "I'd quite forgotten about it. As you left it behind I thoughtit might be regarded as one of the royal treasures and so I brought it - if you think it oughtto be wasted on a thing like seasickness."

"It'll only take a drop," said Lucy.

Caspian opened one of the lockers beneath the bench and brought out the beautiful littlediamond flask which Lucy remembered so well. "Take back your own, Queen," he said.

They then left the cabin and went out into the sunshine.

In the deck there were two large, long hatches, fore and aft of the mast, and both open, asthey always were in fair weather, to let light and air into the belly of the ship. Caspian ledthem down a ladder into the after hatch. Here they found themselves in a place wherebenches for rowing ran from side to side and the light came in through the oarholes anddanced on the roof. Of course Caspian's ship was not that horrible thing, a galley rowedby slaves. Oars were used only when wind failed or for getting in and out of harbour andeveryone (except Reepicheep whose legs were too short) had often taken a turn. At eachside of the ship the space under the benches was left clear for the rowers' feet, but alldown the centre there was a kind of pit which went down to the very keel and this wasfilled with all kinds of things - sacks of flour, casks of water and beer, barrels of pork,jars of honey, skin bottles of wine, apples, nuts, cheeses, biscuits, turnips, sides of bacon.

From the roof - that is, from the under side of the deck - hung hams and strings of onions,and also the men of the watch offduty in their hammocks. Caspian led them aft, steppingfrom bench to bench; at least, it was stepping for him, and something between a step anda jump for Lucy, and a real long jump for Reepicheep. In this way they came to apartition with a door in it. Caspian opened the door and led them into a cabin which filledthe stern underneath the deck cabins in the poop. It was of course not so nice. It was verylow and the sides sloped together as they went down so that there was hardly any floor;and though it had windows of thick glass, they were not made to open because they wereunder water. In fact at this very moment, as the ship pitched they were alternately goldenwith sunlight and dim green with the sea.

"You and I must lodge here, Edmund," said Caspian. "We'll leave your kinsman the bunkand sling hammocks for ourselves."

"I beseech your Majesty-" said Drinian.

"No, no shipmate," said Caspian, "we have argued all that out already. You and Rhince"(Rhince was the mate) "are sailing the ship and will have cares and labours many a nightwhen we are singing catches or telling stories, so you and he must have the port cabinabove. King Edmund and I can lie very snug here below. But how is the stranger?"

Eustace, very green in the face, scowled and asked whether there was any sign of thestorm getting less. But Caspian said, "What storm?" and Drinian burst out laughing.

"Storm, young master!" he roared. "This is as fair weather as a man could ask for."

"Who's that?" said Eustace irritably. "Send him away. His voice goes through my head."

"I've brought you something that will make you feel better, Eustace," said Lucy.

"Oh, go away and leave me alone," growled Eustace. But he took a drop from her flask,and though he said it was beastly stuff (the smell in the cabin when she opened it wasdelicious) it is certain that his face came the right colour a few moments after he hadswallowed it, and he must have felt better because, instead of wailing about the storm and

his head, he began demanding to be put ashore and said that at the first port he would"lodge a disposition" against them all with the British Consul. But when Reepicheepasked what a disposition was and how you lodged it (Reepicheep thought it was somenew way of arranging a single combat) Eustace could only reply, "Fancy not knowingthat." In the end they succeeded in convincing Eustace that they were already sailing asfast as they could towards the nearest land they knew, and that they had no more powerof sending him back to Cambridge - which was where Uncle Harold lived - than ofsending him to the moon. After that he sulkily agreed to put on the fresh clothes whichhad been put out for him and come on deck.

Caspian now showed them over the ship, though indeed they had seen most it already.

They went up on the forecastle and saw the look-out man standing on a little shelf insidethe gilded dragon's neck and peering through its open mouth. Inside the forecastle wasthe galley (or ship's kitchen) and quarters for such people as the boatswain, the carpenter,the cook and the master-archer. If you think it odd to have the galley in the bows andimagine the smoke from its chimney streaming back over the ship, that is because you arethinking of steamships where there is always a headwind. On a sailing ship the wind iscoming from behind, and anything smelly is put as far forward as possible. They weretaken up to the fighting top, and at first it was rather alarming to rock to and fro there andsee the deck looking small and far away beneath. You realized that if you fell there wasno particular reason why you should fall on board rather than in the sea. Then they weretaken to the poop, where Rhince was on duty with another man at the great tiller, andbehind that the dragon's tail rose up, covered with gilding, and round inside it ran a littlebench. The name of the ship was Dawn Treader. She was only a little bit of a thingcompared with one of our I ships, or even with the cogs, dromonds, carracks and galleonswhich Narnia had owned when Lucy and Edmund had reigned there under Peter as theHigh King, for nearly all navigation had died out in the reigns of Caspian's ancestors.

When his uncle, Miraz the usurper, had sent the seven lords to sea, they had had to buy aGalmian ship and man it with hired Galmian sailors. But now Caspian had begun to teachthe Narnians to be sea-faring folk once more, and the Dawn Treader was the finest shiphe had built yet. She was so small that, forward of the mast, there was hardly any deckroom between the central hatch and the ship's boat on one side and the hen-coop (Lucyfed the hens) on the other. But she was a beauty of her kind, a "lady" as sailors say, herlines perfect, her colours pure, and every spar and rope and pin lovingly made. Eustace ofcourse would be pleased with nothing, and kept on boasting about liners and motor-boatsand aeroplanes and submarines ("As if he knew anything about them," mutteredEdmund), but the other two were delighted with the Dawn Treader, and when theyreturned aft to the cabin and supper, and saw the whole western sky lit up with animmense crimson sunset, and felt the quiver of the ship, and tasted the salt on their lips,and thought of unknown lands on the Eastern rim of the world, Lucy felt that she wasalmost too happy to speak.

What Eustace thought had best be told in his own words, for when they all got theirclothes back, dried, next morning, he at once got out a little black notebook and a penciland started to keep a diary. He always had this notebook with him and kept a record ofhis marks in it, for though he didn't care much about any subject for its own sake, he

cared a great deal about marks and would even go to people and say, "I got so much.

What did you get?" But as he didn't seem likely to get many marks on the Dawn Treaderhe now started a diary. This was the first entry.

"7 August. Have now been twenty-four hours on this ghastly boat if it isn't a dream. Allthe time a frightful storm has been raging (it's a good thing I'm not seasick). Huge waveskeep coming in over the front and I have seen the boat nearly go under any number oftimes. All the others pretend to take no notice of this, either from swank or becauseHarold says one of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes toFacts. It's madness to come out into the sea in a rotten little thing like this. Not muchbigger than a lifeboat. And, of course, absolutely primitive indoors. No proper saloon, noradio, no bathrooms, no deck-chairs. I was dragged all over it yesterday evening and itwould make anyone sick to hear Caspian showing off his funny little toy boat as if it wasthe Queen Mary. I tried to tell him what real ships are like, but he's too dense. E. and L.,o f course, didn't back me up. I suppose a kid like L. doesn't realize the danger and E. isbuttering up C. as everyone does here. They call him a King. I said I was a Republicanbut he had to ask me what that meant! He doesn't seem to know anything at all. Needlessto say I've been put in the worst cabin of the boat, a perfect dungeon, and Lucy has beengiven a whole room on deck to herself, almost a nice room compared with the rest of thisplace. C. says that's because she's a girl. I tried to make him see what Alberta says, thatall that sort of thing is really lowering girls but he was too dense. Still, he might see that Ishall be ill if I'm kept in that hole any longer. E. says we mustn't grumble because C. issharing it with us himself to make room for L. As if that didn't make it more crowded andfar worse. Nearly forgot to say that there is also a kind of Mouse thing that giveseveryone the most frightful cheek. The others can put up with it if they like but I shalltwist his tail pretty soon if he tries it on me. The food is frightful too."

The trouble between Eustace and Reepicheep arrived even sooner than might have beenexpected. Before dinner next day, when the others were sitting round the table , waiting(being at sea gives one a magnificent appetite), Eustace came rushing in, wringing hishand and shouting out:

"That little brute has half killed me. I insist on it being kept under control. I could bringan action against you, Caspian. i could order you to have it destroyed."

At the same moment Reepicheep appeared. His sword was drawn and his whiskerslooked very fierce but he was as polite as ever.

"I ask your pardons all," he said, "and especially her Majesty's. If I had known that hewould take refuge here I would have awaited a more reasonable time for his correction."

"What on earth's up?" asked Edmund.

What had really happened was this. Reepicheep, who never felt that the ship was gettingon fast enough, loved to sit on the bulwarks far forward just beside the dragon's head,gazing out at the eastern horizon and singing softly in his little chirruping voice the song

the Dryad had made for him. He never held on to anything, however the ship pitched, andkept his balance with perfect ease; perhaps his long tail, hanging down to the deck insidethe bulwarks, made this easier. Everyone on board was familiar with this habit, and thesailors liked it because when one was on look-out duty it gave one somebody to talk to.

Why exactly Eustace had slipped and reeled and stumbled all the way forward to theforecastle (he had not yet got his sea-legs) I never heard. Perhaps he hoped he would seeland, or perhaps he wanted to hang about the galley and scrounge something. Anyway, assoon as he saw that long tail hanging down - and perhaps it was rather tempting - hethought it would be delightful to catch hold of it, swing Reepicheep round by it once ortwice upside-down, then run away and laugh, At first the plan seemed to workbeautifully. The Mouse was not much heavier than a very large cat. Eustace had him offthe rail in a trice and very silly he looked (thought Eustace) with his little limbs allsplayed out and his mouth open. But unfortunately Reepicheep, who had fought for hislife many a time, never lost his head even for a moment. Nor his skill. It is not very easyto draw one's sword when one is swinging round in the air by one's tail, but he did. Andthe next thing Eustace knew was two agonizing jabs in his hand which made him let goof the tail; and the next thing after that was that the Mouse had picked itself up again as ifit were a ball bouncing off the deck, and there it was facing him, and a horrid long,bright, sharp thing like a skewer was waving to and fro within an inch of his stomach.

(This doesn't count as below the belt for mice in Narnia because they can hardly beexpected to reach higher.)

"Stop it," spluttered Eustace, "go away. Put that thing away. It's not safe. Stop it, I say. I'lltell Caspian.

I'll have you muzzled and tied up."

"Why do you not draw your own sword, poltroon!" cheeped the Mouse. "Draw and fightor I'll beat you black and blue with the flat."

"I haven't got one," said Eustace. "I'm a pacifist. I don't believe in fighting."

"Do I understand," said Reepicheep, withdrawing his sword for a moment and speakingvery sternly, "that you do not intend to give me satisfaction?"

"I don't know what you mean," said Eustace, nursing his hand. "If you don't know how totake a joke I shan't bother my head about you."

"Then take that," said Reepicheep, "and that - to teach you manners - and the respect dueto a knight - and a Mouse - and a Mouse's tail -" and at each word he gave Eustace a blowwith the side of his rapier, which was thin, fine dwarf-tempered steel and as supple andeffective as a birch rod. Eustace (of course) was at a school where they didn't havecorporal punishment, so the sensation was quite new to him. That was why, in spite ofhaving no sealegs, it took him less than a minute to get off that forecastle and cover thewhole length of the deck and burst in at the cabin door - still hotly pursued by

Reepicheep. Indeed it seemed to Eustace that the rapier as well as the pursuit was hot. Itmight have been red-hot by the feel.

There was not much difficulty in settling the matter once Eustace realized that everyonetook the idea of a duel seriously and heard Caspian offering to lend him a sword, andDrinian and Edmund discussing whether he ought to be handicapped in some way tomake up for his being so much bigger than Reepicheep. He apologized sulkily and wentoff with Lucy to have his hand bathed and bandaged and then went to his bunk. He wascareful to lie on his side.
