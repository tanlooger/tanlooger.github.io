title: CHAPTER 7. HOW THE ADVENTURE ENDED
---

"LOOK at what?" said Edmund.

"Look at the device on the gold," said Caspian.

"A little hammer with a diamond above it like a star," said Drinian. "Why, I've seen thatbefore."

"Seen it!" said Caspian. "Why, of course you have. It is the sign of a great Narnian house.

This is the Lord Octesian's arm-ring."

"Villain," said Reepicheep to the dragon, "have you devoured a Narnian lord?" But thedragon shook his head violently.

"Or perhaps," said Lucy, "this is the Lord Octesian, turned into a dragon - under anenchantment, you know."

"It needn't be either," said Edmund. "All dragons collect gold. But I think it's a safe guessthat Octesian got no further than this island."

"Are you the Lord Octesian?" said Lucy to the dragon, and then, when it sadly shook itshead, "Are you someone enchanted - someone human, I mean?"

It nodded violently.

And then someone said - people disputed afterwards whether Lucy or Edmund said it first- "You're not - not Eustace by any chance?"

And Eustace nodded his terrible dragon head and thumped his tail in the sea andeveryone skipped back (some of the sailors with ejaculations I will not put down inwriting) to avoid the enormous and boiling tears which flowed from his eyes.

Lucy tried hard to console him and even screwed up her courage to kiss the scaly face,and nearly everyone said "Hard luck" and several assured Eustace that they would allstand by him and many said there was sure to be some way of disenchanting him andthey'd have him as right as rain in a day or two. And of course they were all very anxiousto hear his story, but he couldn't speak. More than once in the days that followed heattempted to write it for them on the sand. But, this never succeeded. In the first placeEustace (never having read the right books) had no idea how to tell a story straight. Andfor another thing, the muscles and nerves of the dragon-claws that he had to use hadnever learned to write and were not built for writing anyway. As a result he never gotnearly to the end before the tide came in and washed away all the writing except the bitshe had already trodden on or accidentaly swished out with his tail. And all that anyonehad seen would be something like this - the dots are for the bits he had smudged

It was, however, clear to everyone that Eustace's character had been rather improved bybecoming a dragon. He was anxious to help. He flew over the whole island and found itwas all mountainous and inhabited only by wild goats and droves of wild swine. Of thesehe brought back many carcasses as provisions for the ship. He was a very humane killertoo, for he could dispatch a beast with one blow of his tail so that it didn't know (andpresumably still doesn't know) it had been killed. He ate a few himself, of course, butalways alone, for now that he was a dragon he liked his food raw but he could never bearto let others see him at his messy meals. And one day, flying slowly and wearily but ingreat triumph, he bore back to camp a great tall pine tree which he had torn up by theroots in a distant valley and which could be made into a capital mast. And in the eveningif it turned chilly, as it sometimes did after the heavy rains, he was a comfort to everyone,for the whole party would come and sit with their backs against his hot sides and get wellwarmed and dried; and one puff of his fiery breath would light the most obstinate fire.

Sometimes he would take a select party for a fly on his back, so that they could seewheeling below them the green slopes, the rocky heights, the narrow pit-like valleys andfar out over the sea to the eastward a spot of darker blue on the blue horizon which mightbe land.

The pleasure (quite new to him) of being liked and, still more, of liking other people, waswhat kept Eustace from despair. For it was very dreary being a dragon. He shudderedwhenever he caught sight of his own reflection as he flew over a mountain lake. He hatedthe huge batlike wings, the saw-edged ridge on his back, and the cruel, curved claws. Hewas almost afraid to be alone with himself and yet he was ashamed to be with the others.

On the evenings when he was not being used as a hot-water bottle he would slink awayfrom the camp and lie curled up like a snake between the wood and the water. On suchoccasions, greatly to his surprise, Reepicheep was his most constant comforter. The nobleMouse would creep away from the merry circle at the camp fire and sit down by thedragon's head, well to the windward to be out of the way of his smoky breath. There hewould explain that what had happened to Eustace was a striking illustration of the turn ofFortune's wheel, and that if he had Eustace at his own house in Narnia (it was really ahole not a house and the dragon's head, let alone his body, would not have fitted in) hecould show him more than a hundred examples of emperors, kings, dukes, knights, poets,lovers, astronomers, philosophers, and magicians, who had fallen from prosperity into themost distressing circumstances, and of whom many had recovered and lived happily everafterwards. It did not, perhaps, seem so very comforting at the time, but it was kindlymeant and Eustace never forgot it.

But of course what hung over everyone like a cloud was the problem of what to do withtheir dragon when they were ready to sail. They tried not to talk of it when he was there,but he couldn't help overhearing things like, "Would he fit all along one side of the deck?

And we'd have to shift all the stores to the other side down below so as to balance," or,"Would towing him be any good?" or "Would he be able to keep up by flying?" and(most often of all), "But how are we to feed him?" And poor Eustace realized more and

more that since the first day he came on board he had been an unmitigated nuisance andthat he was now a greater nuisance still. And this ate into his mind, just as that braceletate into his foreleg. He knew that it only made it worse to tear at it with his great teeth,but he couldn't help tearing now and then, especially on hot nights.

About six days after they had landed on Dragon Island, Edmund happened to wake upvery early one morning. It was just getting grey so that you could see the tree-trunks ifthey were between you and the bay but not in the other direction. As he woke he thoughthe heard something moving, so he raised himself on one elbow and looked about him:and presently he thought he saw a dark figure moving on the seaward side of the wood.

The idea that at once occurred to his mind was, "Are we so sure there are no natives onthis island after all?" Then he thought it was Caspian - it was about the right size - but heknew that Caspian had been sleeping next to him and could see that he hadn't moved.

Edmund made sure that his sword was in its place and then rose to investigate.

He came down softly to the edge of the wood and the dark figure was still there. He sawnow that it was too small for Caspian and too big for Lucy. It did not run away. Edmunddrew his sword and was about to challenge the stranger when the stranger said in a lowvoice, "Is that you, Edmund?"

"Yes. Who are you?" said he.

"Don't you know me?" said the other. "It's me Eustace."

"By jove," said Edmund, "so it is. My dear chap -"

"Hush," said Eustace and lurched as if he were going to fall.

"Hello!" said Edmund, steadying him. "What's up? Are you ill?"

Eustace was silent for so long that Edmund thought he was fainting; but at last he said,"It's been ghastly. You don't know . . . but it's all right now. Could we go and talksomewhere? I don't want to meet the others just yet."

"Yes, rather, anywhere you like," said Edmund. "We can go and sit on the rocks overthere. I say, I am glad to see you - er - looking yourself again. You must have had a prettybeastly time."

They went to the rocks and sat down looking out across the bay while the sky got palerand paler and the stars disappeared except for one very bright one low down and near thehorizon.

"I won't tell you how I became a - a dragon till I can tell the others and get it all over,"said Eustace. "By the way, I didn't even know it was a dragon till I heard you all using theword when I turned up here the other morning. I want to tell you how I stopped beingone."

"Fire ahead," said Edmund.

"Well, last night I was more miserable than ever. And that beastly arm-ring was hurtinglike anything-"

"Is that all right now?"

Eustace laughed - a different laugh from any Edmund had heard him give before - andslipped the bracelet easily off his arm. "There it is," he said, "and anyone who likes canhave it as far as I'm concerned. Well, as I say, I was lying awake and wondering what onearth would become of me. And then - but, mind you, it may have been all a dream. Idon't know."

"Go on," said Edmund, with considerable patience.

"Well, anyway, I looked up and saw the very last thing I expected: a huge lion comingslowly towards me. And one queer thing was that there was no moon last night, but therewas moonlight where the lion was. So it came nearer and nearer. I was terribly afraid ofit. You may think that, being a dragon, I could have knocked any lion out easily enough.

But it wasn't that kind of fear. I wasn't afraid of it eating me, I was just afraid of it - if youcan understand. Well, it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes. And I shutmy eyes tight. But that wasn't any good because it told me to follow it."

"You mean it spoke?"

"I don't know. Now that you mention it, I don't think it did. But it told me all the same.

And I knew I'd have to do what it told me, so I got up and followed it. And it led me along way into the mountains. And there was always this moonlight over and round thelion wherever we went. So at last we came to the top of a mountain I'd never seen beforeand on the top of this mountain there was a garden - trees and fruit and everything. In themiddle of it there was a well.

"I knew it was a well because you could see the water bubbling up from the bottom of it:but it was a lot bigger than most wells - like a very big, round bath with marble stepsgoing down into it. The water was as clear as anything and I thought if I could get inthere and bathe it would ease the pain in my leg. But the lion told me I must undress first.

Mind you, I don't know if he said any words out loud or not.

"I was just going to say that I couldn't undress because I hadn't any clothes on when Isuddenly thought that dragons are snaky sort of things and snakes can cast their skins.

Oh, of course, thought I, that's what the lion means. So I started scratching myself andmy scales began coming off all over the place. And then I scratched a little deeper and,instead of just scales coming off here and there, my whole skin started peeling offbeautifully, like it does after an illness, or as if I was a banana. In a minute or two I just

stepped out of it. I could see it lying there beside me, looking rather nasty. It was a mostlovely feeling. So I started to go down into the well for my bathe.

"But just as I was going to put my feet into the water I looked down and saw that theywere all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before. Oh, that's allright, said I, it only means I had another smaller suit on underneath the first one, and I'llhave to get out of it too. So 1 scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled offbeautifully and out I stepped and left it lying beside the other one and went down to thewell for my bathe.

"Well, exactly the same thing happened again. And I thought to myself, oh dear, however many skins have I got to take off? For I was longing to bathe my leg. So I scratchedaway for the third time and got off a third skin, just like the two others, and stepped outof it. But as soon as I looked at myself in the water I knew it had been no good.

"Then the lion said - but I don't know if it spoke - "You will have to let me undress you."I was afraid of his claws, I can tell you, but I was pretty nearly desperate now. So I justlay flat down on my back to let him do it.

"The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart.

And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I've ever felt. Theonly thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off.

You know - if you've ever picked the scab off a sore place. It hurts like billy-oh but it issuch fun to see it coming away."

"I know exactly what you mean," said Edmund.

"Well, he peeled the beastly stuff right off - just as I thought I'd done it myself the otherthree times, only they hadn't hurt - and there it was lying on the grass: only ever so muchthicker, and darker, and more knobbly-looking than the others had been. And there was Ias smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been. Then he caught holdof me - I didn't like that much for I was very tender underneath now that I'd no skin on -

and threw me into the water. It smarted like anything but only for a moment. After that itbecame perfectly delicious and as soon as I started swimming and splashing I found thatall the pain had gone from my arm. And then I saw why. I'd turned into a boy again.

You'd think me simply phoney if I told you how I felt about my own arms. I knowthey've no muscle and are pretty mouldy compared with Caspian's, but I was so glad tosee them.

"After a bit the lion took me out and dressed me -"

"Dressed you. With his paws?"

"Well, I don't exactly remember that bit. But he did somehow or other: in new clothes -

the same I've got on now, as a matter of fact. And then suddenly I was back here. Whichis what makes me think it must have been a dream."

"No. It wasn't a dream," said Edmund.

"Why not?"

"Well, there are the clothes, for one thing. And you have been - well, un-dragoned, foranother."

"What do you think it was, then?" asked Eustace.

"I think you've seen Aslan," said Edmund.

"Aslan!" said Eustace. "I've heard that name mentioned several times since we joined theDawn Treader. And I felt - I don't know what - I hated it. But I was hating everythingthen. And by the way, I'd like to apologize. I'm afraid I've been pretty beastly."

"That's all right," said Edmund. "Between ourselves, you haven't been as bad as I was onmy first trip to Narnia. You were only an ass, but I was a traitor."

"Well, don't tell me about it, then," said Eustace. "But who is Aslan? Do you know him?"

"Well - he knows me," said Edmund. "He is the great Lion, the son of the Emperor-

beyond-the-Sea, who saved me and saved Narnia. We've all seen him. Lucy sees himmost often. And it may be Aslan's country we are sailing to."

Neither said anything for a while. The last bright star had vanished and though they couldnot see the sunrise because of the mountains on their right, they knew it was going onbecause the sky above them and the bay before them turned the colour of roses. Thensome bird of the parrot kind screamed in the wood behind them, they heard movementsamong the trees, and finally a blast on Caspian's horn. The camp was astir.

Great was the rejoicing when Edmund and the restored Eustace walked into the breakfastcircle round the camp fire. And now of course everyone heard the earlier part of his story.

People wondered whether the other dragon had killed the Lord Octesian several years agoor whether Octesian himself had been the old dragon. The jewels with which Eustace hadcrammed his pockets in the cave had disappeared along with the clothes he had then beenwearing: but no one, least of all Eustace himself, felt any desire to go back to that valleyfor more treasure.

In a few days now the Dawn Treader, remasted, re-painted, and well stored, was ready tosail. Before they embarked Caspian caused to be cut on a smooth cliff facing the bay thewords:

Two narrow escapes

DRAGON ISLAND DISCOVERED BY CASPIAN X, KING OF NARNIA, ETC. INTHE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN. HERE, AS WE SUPPOSE, THE LORDOCTESIAN HAD HIS DEATH

It would be nice, and fairly true, to say that "from that time forth Eustace was a differentboy". To be strictly accurate, he began to be a different boy. He had relapses. There werestill many days when he could be very tiresome. But most of those I shall not notice. Thecure had begun.

The Lord Octesian's arm ring had a curious fate. Eustace did not want it and offered it toCaspian and Caspian offered it to Lucy. She did not care about having it. "Very well,then, catch as catch can," said Caspian and flung it up in the air. This was when they wereall standing looking at the inscription. Up went the ring, flashing in the sunlight, andcaught, and hung, as neatly as a well-thrown quoit, on a little projection on the rock. Noone could climb up to get it from below and no one could climb down to get it fromabove. And there, for all I know, it is hanging still and may hang till that world ends.
