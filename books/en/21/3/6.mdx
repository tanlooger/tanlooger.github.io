title: CHAPTER 6. THE ADVENTURES OF EUSTACE
---

AT that very moment the others were washing hands and faces in the river and generallygetting ready for dinner and a rest. The three best archers had gone up into the hills northof the bay and returned laden with a pair of wild goats which were now roasting over afire. Caspian had ordered a cask of wine ashore, strong wine of Archenland which had tobe mixed with water before you drank it, so there would be plenty for all. The work had

gone well so far and it was a merry meal. Only after the second helping of goat didEdmund say, "Where's that blighter Eustace?"

Meanwhile Eustace stared round the unknown valley. It was so narrow and deep, and theprecipices which surrounded it so sheer, that it was like a huge pit or trench. The floorwas grassy though strewn with rocks, and here and there Eustace saw black burnt patcheslike those you see on the sides of a railway embankment in a dry summer.

About fifteen yards away from him was a pool of clear, smooth water. There was, at first,nothing else at all in the valley; not an animal, not a bird, not an insect. The sun beatdown and grim peaks and horns of mountains peered over the valley's edge.

Eustace realized of course that in the fog he had come down the wrong side of the ridge,so he turned at once to see about getting back. But as soon as he had looked heshuddered. Apparently he had by amazing luck found the only possible way down - along green spit of land, horribly steep and narrow, with precipices on either side. Therewas no other possible way of getting back. But could he do it, now that he saw what itwas really like? His head swam at the very thought of it.

He turned round again, thinking that at any rate he'd better have a good drink from thepool first. But as soon as he had turned and before he had taken a step forward into thevalley he heard a noise behind him. It was only a small noise but it sounded loud in thatimmense silence. It froze him dead-still where he stood for a second. Then he slewedround his neck and looked.

At the bottom of the cliff a little on his left hand was a low, dark hole - the entrance to acave perhaps. And out of this two thin wisps of smoke were coming. And the loose stonesjust beneath the dark hollow were moving (that was the noise he had heard) just as ifsomething were crawling in the dark behind them.

Something was crawling. Worse still, something was coming out. Edmund or Lucy oryou would have recognized it at once, but Eustace had read none of the right books. Thething that came out of the cave was something he had never even imagined - along lead-

coloured snout, dull red eyes, no feathers or fur, a long lithe body that trailed on theground, legs whose elbows went up higher than its back like a spider's cruel claws, bat'swings that made a rasping noise on the stones, yards of tail. And the lines of smoke werecoming from its two nostrils. He never said the word Dragon to himself. Nor would ithave made things any better if he had.

But perhaps if he had known something about dragons he would have been a littlesurprised at this dragon's behaviour. It did not sit up and clap its wings, nor did it shootout a stream of flame from its mouth. The smoke from its nostrils was like the smoke of afire that will not last much longer. Nor did it seem to have noticed Eustace. It moved veryslowly towards the pool - slowly and with many pauses. Even in his fear Eustace felt thatit was an old, sad creature. He wondered if he dared make a dash for the ascent. But itmight look round if he made any noise. It might come more to life. Perhaps it was only

shamming. Anyway, what was the use of trying to escape by climbing from a creaturethat could fly?

It reached the pool and slid its horrible scaly chin down over the gravel to drink: butbefore it had drunk there came from it a great croaking or clanging cry and after a fewtwitches and convulsions it rolled round on its side and lay perfectly still with one claw inthe air. A little dark blood gushed from its wide-opened mouth. The smoke from itsnostrils turned black for a moment and then floated away. No more came. this was thebrute's trick, the way it lured travellers to their doom. But one couldn't wait for ever. Hetook a step nearer, then two steps, and halted again. The dragon remained motionless; henoticed too that the red fire had gone out of its eyes. At last he came up to it. He wasquite sure now that it was dead. With a shudder he touched it; nothing happened.

The relief was so great that Eustace almost laughed out loud. He began to feel as if hehad fought and killed the dragon instead of merely seeing it die. He stepped over it andwent to the pool for his drink, for the heat was getting unbearable. He was not surprisedwhen he heard a peal of thunder. Almost immediately afterwards the sun disappeared andbefore he had finished his drink big drops of rain were falling.

The climate of this island was a very unpleasant one. In less than a minute Eustace waswet to the skin and half blinded with such rain as one never sees in Europe. There was nouse trying to climb out of the valley as long as this lasted. He bolted for the only shelterin sight - the dragon's cave. There he lay down and tried to get his breath.

Most of us know what we should expect to find in a dragon's lair, but, as I said before,Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and importsand governments and drains, but they were weak on dragons. That is why he was sopuzzled at the surface on which he was lying. Parts of it were too prickly to be stones andtoo hard to be thorns, and there seemed to be a great many round, flat things, and it allclinked when he moved. There was light enough at the cave's mouth to examine it by.

And of course Eustace found it to be what any of us could have told him in advance -

treasure. There were crowns (those were the prickly things), coins, rings, bracelets,ingots, cups, plates and gems.

Eustace (unlike most boys) had never thought much of treasure but he saw at once the useit would be in this new world which he had so foolishly stumbled into through the picturein Lucy's bedroom at home. "They don't have any tax here," he said, "And you don't haveto give treasure to the government. With some of this stuff I could have quite a decenttime here - perhaps in Calormen. It sounds the least phoney of these countries. I wonderhow much I can carry? That bracelet now - those things in it are probably diamonds - I'llslip that on my own wrist. Too big, but not if I push it right up here above my elbow.

Then fill my pockets with diamonds - that's easier than gold. I wonder when this infernalrain's going to let up?" He got into a less uncomfortable part of the pile, where it wasmostly coins, and settled down to wait. But a bad fright, when once it is over, andespecially a bad fright following a mountain walk, leaves you very tired. Eustace fellasleep.

By the time he was sound asleep and snoring the others had finished dinner and becameseriously alarmed about him. They shouted, "Eustace! Eustace! Coo-ee!" till they werehoarse and Caspian blew his horn.

"He's nowhere near or he'd have heard that," said Lucy with a white face.

"Confound the fellow," said Edmund. "What on earth did he want to slink away like thisfor?"

"But we must do something," said Lucy. "He may have got lost, or fallen into a hole, orbeen captured by savages."

"Or killed by wild beasts," said Drinian.

"And a good riddance if he has, I say," muttered Rhince.

"Master Rhince," said Reepicheep, "you never spoke a word that became you less. Thecreature is no friend of mine but he is of the Queen's blood, and while he is one of ourfellowship it concerns our honour to find him and to avenge him if he is dead."

"Of course we've got to find him (if we can)," said Caspian wearily. "That's the nuisanceof it. It means a search party and endless trouble. Bother Eustace."

Meanwhile Eustace slept and slept - and slept. What woke him was a pain in his arm. Themoon was shining in at the mouth of the cave, and the bed of treasures seemed to havegrown much more comfortable: in fact he could hardly feel it at all. He was puzzled bythe pain in his arm at first, but presently it occurred to him that the bracelet which he hadshoved up above his elbow had become strangely tight. His arm must have swollen whilehe was asleep (it was his left arm).

He moved his right arm in order to feel his left, but stopped before he had moved it aninch and bit his lip in terror. For just in front of him, and a little on his right, where themoonlight fell clear on the floor of the cave, he saw a hideous shape moving. He knewthat shape: it was a dragon's claw. It had moved as he moved his hand and became stillwhen he stopped moving his hand.

"Oh, what a fool I've been," thought Eustace. "Of course, the brute had a mate and it'slying beside me."

For several minutes he did not dare to move a muscle. He saw two thin columns of smokegoing up before his eyes, black against the moonlight; just as there had been smokecoming from the other dragon's nose before it died. This was so alarming that he held hisbreath. The two columns of smoke vanished. When he could hold his breath no longer helet it out stealthily; instantly two jets of smoke appeared again. But even yet he had noidea of the truth.

Presently he decided that he would edge very cautiously to his left and try to creep out ofthe cave. Perhaps the creature was asleep - and anyway it was his only chance. But ofcourse before he edged to the left he looked to the left. Oh horror! there was a dragon'sclaw on that side too.

No one will blame Eustace if at this moment he shed tears. He was surprised at the size ofhis own tears as he saw them splashing on to the treasure in front of him. They alsoseemed strangely hot; steam went up from them.

But there was no good crying. He must try to crawl out from between the two dragons.

He began extending his right arm. The dragon's fore-leg and claw on his right wentthrough exactly the same motion. Then he thought he would try his left. The dragon limbon that side moved too.

Two dragons, one on each side, mimicking whatever he did! His nerve broke and hesimply made a bolt for it.

There was such a clatter and rasping, and clinking of gold, and grinding of stones, as herushed out of the cave that he thought they were both following him. He daren't lookback. He rushed to the pool. The twisted shape of the dead dragon lying in the moonlightwould have been enough to frighten anyone but now he hardly noticed it. His idea was toget into the water.

But just as he reached the edge of the pool two things happened. First of all it came overhim like a thunder-clap that he had been running on all fours - and why on earth had hebeen doing that? And secondly, as he bent towards the water, he thought for a second thatyet another dragon was staring up at him out of the pool. But in an instant he realized thetruth. The dragon face in the pool was his own reflection. There was no doubt of it. Itmoved as he moved: it opened and shut its mouth as he opened and shut his.

He had turned into a dragon while he was asleep. Sleeping on a dragon's hoard withgreedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself.

That explained everything. There had been no two dragons beside him in the cave. Theclaws to right and left had been his own right and left claw. The two columns of smokehad been coming from his own nostrils. As for the pain in his left arm (or what had beenhis left arm) he could now see what had happened by squinting with his left eye. Thebracelet which had fitted very nicely on the upper arm of a boy was far too small for thethick, stumpy foreleg of a dragon. It had sunk deeply into his scaly flesh and there was athrobbing bulge on each side of it. He tore at the place with his dragon's teeth but couldnot get it off.

In spite of the pain, his first feeling was one of relief. There was nothing to be afraid ofany more. He was a terror himself and nothing in the world but a knight (and not all ofthose) would dare to attack him. He could get even with Caspian and Edmund now But

the moment he thought this he realized that he didn't want to. He wanted to be friends. Hewanted to get back among humans and talk and laugh and share things. He realized thathe was a monster cut off from the whole human race. An appalling loneliness came overhim. He began to see that the others had not really been fiends at all. He began to wonderif he himself had been such a nice person as he had always supposed. He longed for theirvoices. He would have been grateful for a kind word even from Reepicheep.

When he thought of this the poor dragon that had been Eustace lifted up its voice andwept. A powerful dragon crying its eyes out under the moon in a deserted valley is a sightand a sound hardly to be imagined.

At last he decided he would try to find his way back to the shore. He realized now thatCaspian would never have sailed away and left him. And he felt sure that somehow orother he would be able to make people understand who he was.

He took a long drink and then (I know this sounds shocking, but it isn't if you think itover) he ate nearly all the dead dragon. He was half-way through it before he realizedwhat he was doing; for, you see, though his mind was the mind of Eustace, his tastes andhis digestion were dragonish. And there is nothing a dragon likes so well as fresh dragon.

That is why you so seldom find more than one dragon in the same county.

Then he turned to climb out of the valley. He began the climb with a jump and as soon ashe jumped he found that he was flying. He had quite forgotten about his wings and it wasa great surprise to him - the first pleasant surprise he had had for a long time. He rosehigh into the air and saw innumerable mountain-tops spread out beneath him in themoonlight. He could see the bay like a silver slab and the Dawn Treader lying at anchorand camp fires twinkling in the woods beside the beach. From a great height he launchedhimself down towards them in a single glide.

Lucy was sleeping very soundly for she had sat up till the return of the search party inhope of good news about Eustace. It had been led by Caspian and had come back late andweary. Their news was disquieting. They had found no trace of Eustace but had seen adead dragon in a valley. They tried to make the best of it and everyone assured everyoneelse that there were not likely to he more dragons about, and that one which was dead atabout three o'clock that afternoon (which was when they had seen it) would hardly havebeen killing people a very few hours before.

"Unless it ate the little brat and died of him: he'd poison anything," said Rhince. But hesaid this under his breath and no one heard it.

But later in the night Lucy was wakened, very softly, and found the whole companygathered close together and talking in whispers.

"What is it?" said Lucy.

"We must all show great constancy," Caspian was saying. "A dragon has just flown overthe tree-tops and lighted on the beach. Yes, I am afraid it is between us and the ship. Andarrows are no use against dragons. And they're not at all afraid of fire."

"With your Majesty's leave-" began Reepicheep.

"No, Reepicheep," said the King very firmly, "you are not to attempt a single combatwith it. And unless you promise to obey me in this matter I'll have you tied up. We mustjust keep close watch and, as soon as it is light, go down to the beach and give it battle. Iwill lead. King Edmund will be on my right and the Lord Drinian on my left. There areno other arrangements to be made. It will be light in a couple of hours. In an hour's timelet a meal be served out and what is left of the wine. And let everything be done silently."

"Perhaps it will go away," said Lucy.

"It'll be worse if it does," said Edmund, "because then we shan't know where it is. Ifthere's a wasp in the room I like to be able to see it."

The rest of the night wa dreadful, and when the meal came, though they knew they oughtto eat, many found that they had very poor appetites. And endless hours seemed to passbefore the darkness thinned and birds began chirping here and there and the world gotcolder and wetter than it had been all night and Caspian said, "Now for it, friends."

They got up, all with swords drawn, and formed themselves into a solid mass with Lucyin the middle and Reepicheep on her shoulder. It was nicer than the waiting about andeveryone felt fonder of everyone else than at ordinary times. A moment later they weremarching. It grew lighter as they came to the edge of the wood. And there on the sand,like a giant lizard, or a flexible crocodile, or a serpent with legs, huge and horrible andhumpy, lay the dragon.

But when it saw them, instead of rising up and blowing fire and smoke, the dragonretreated - you could almost say it waddled - back into the shallows of the bay.

"What's it wagging its head like that for?" said Edmund.

"And now it's nodding," said Caspian.

"And there's something coming from its eyes," said Drinian.

"Oh, can't you see," said Lucy. "It's crying. Those are tears."

"I shouldn't trust to that, Ma'am," said Drinian. "That's what crocodiles do, to put you offyour guard."

"It wagged its head when you said that," remarked Edmund. "Just as if it meant No.

Look, there it goes again."

"Do you think it understands what we're saying?" asked Lucy.

The dragon nodded its head violently.

Reepicheep slipped off Lucy's shoulder and stepped to the front.

"Dragon," came his shrill voice, "can you understand speech?"

The dragon nodded.

"Can you speak?"

It shook its head.

"Then," said Reepicheep, "it is idle to ask you your business. But if you will swearfriendship with us raise your left foreleg above your head."

It did so, but clumsily because that leg was sore and swollen with the golden bracelet

"Oh look," said Lucy, "there's something wrong with its leg. The poor thing - that'sprobably what it was crying about. Perhaps it came to us to be cured like in Androclesand the lion."

"Be careful, Lucy," said Caspian. "It's a very clever dragon but it may be a liar."

Lucy had, however, already run forward, followed by Reepicheep, as fast as his short legscould carry him, and then of course the boys and Drinian came, too.

"Show me your poor paw," said Lucy, "I might be able to cure it."

The dragon-that-had-been-Eustace held out its sore leg gladly enough, remembering howLucy's cordial had cured him of sea-sickness before he became a dragon. But he wasdisappointed. The magic fluid reduced the swelling and eased the pain a little but it couldnot dissolve the gold.

Everyone had now crowded round to watch the treatment, and Caspian suddenlyexclaimed, "Look!" He was staring at the bracelet.
