title: CHAPTER 10. THE MAGICIAN'S BOOK
---

THE invisible people feasted their guests royally. It was very funny to see the plates anddishes coming to the table and not to see anyone carrying them. It would have been funnyeven if they had moved along level with the floor, as you would expect things to do ininvisible hands. But they didn't. They progressed up the long dining-hall in a series ofbounds or jumps. At the highest point of each jump a dish would be about fifteen feet upin the air; then it would come down and stop quite suddenly about three feet from thefloor. When the dish contained anything like soup or stew the result was rather disastrous.

"I'm beginning to feel very inquisitive about these people," whispered Eustace toEdmund. "Do you think they're human at all? More like huge grasshoppers or giant frogs,I should say."

"It does look like it," said Edmund. "But don't put the idea of the grasshoppers intoLucy's head. She's not too keen on insects; especially big ones."

The meal would have been pleasanter if it had not been so exceedingly messy, and also ifthe conversation had not consisted entirely of agreements. The invisible people agreedabout everything. Indeed most of their remarks were the sort it would not be easy todisagree with: "What I always say is, when a chap's hungry, he likes some victuals," or"Getting dark now; always does at night," or even "Ah, you've come over the water.

Powerful wet stuff, ain't it?" And Lucy could not help looking at the dark yawningentrance to the foot of the staircase - she could see it from where she sat - and wonderingwhat she would find when she went up those stairs next morning. But it was a good meal

otherwise, with mushroom soup and boiled chickens and hot boiled ham andgooseberries, redcurrants, curds, cream, milk, and mead. The others liked the mead butEustace was sorry afterwards that he had drunk any.

When Lucy woke up next morning it was like waking up on the day of an examination ora day when you are going to the dentist. It was a lovely morning with bees buzzing in andout of her open window and the lawn outside looking very like somewhere in England.

She got up and dressed and tried to talk and eat ordinarily at breakfast. Then, after beinginstructed by the Chief Voice about what she was to do upstairs, she bid goodbye to theothers, said nothing, walked to the bottom of the stairs, and began going up them withoutonce looking back.

It was quite light, that was one good thing. There was, indeed, a window straight ahead ofher at the top of the first flight. As long as she was 9n that flight she could hear the tick-

tock-tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hall below. Then she came to the landing andhad to turn to her left up the next flight; after that she couldn't hear the clock any more.

Now she had come to the top of the stairs. Lucy looked and saw a long, wide passagewith a large window at the far end. Apparently the passage ran the whole length of thehouse. It was carved and panelled and carpeted and very many doors opened off it oneach side. She stood still and couldn't hear the squeak of a mouse, or the buzzing of a fly,or the swaying of a curtain, or anything - except the beating of her own heart.

"The last doorway on the left," she said to herself. It did seem a bit hard that it should bethe last. To reach it she would have to walk past room after room. And in any room theremight be the magician - asleep, or awake, or invisible, or even dead. But it wouldn't do tothink about that. She set out on her journey. The carpet was so thick that her feet made nonoise.

"There's nothing whatever to be afraid of yet," Lucy told herself. And certainly it was aquiet, sunlit passage; perhaps a bit too quiet. It would have been nicer if there had notbeen strange signs painted in scarlet on the doors twisty, complicated things whichobviously had a meaning and it mightn't be a very nice meaning either. It would havebeen nicer still if there weren't those masks hanging on the wall. Not that they wereexactly ugly - or not so very ugly - but the empty eye-holes did look queer, and if you letyourself you would soon start imagining that the masks were doing things as soon as yourback was turned to them.

After about the sixth door she got her first real fright. For one second she felt almostcertain that a wicked little bearded face had popped out of the wall and made a grimace ather. She forced herself to stop and look at it. And it was not a face at all. It was a littlemirror just the size and shape of her own face, with hair on the top of it and a beardhanging down from it, so that when you looked in the mirror your own face fitted into thehair and beard and it looked as if they belonged to you. "I just caught my own reflectionwith the tail of my eye as I went past," said Lucy to herself. "That was all it was. It's quite

harmless." But she didn't like the look of her own face with that hair and beard, and wenton. (I don't know what the Bearded Glass was for because I am not a magician.)

Before she reached the last door on the left, Lucy was beginning to wonder whether thecorridor had grown longer since she began her journey and whether this was part of themagic of the house. But she got to it at last. And the door was open.

It was a large room with three big windows and it was lined from floor to ceiling withbooks; more books than Lucy had ever seen before, tiny little books, fat and dumpybooks, and books bigger than any church Bible you have ever seen, all bound in leatherand smelling old and learned and magical. But she knew from her instructions that sheneed not bother about any of these. For the Book, the Magic Book, was lying on areading-desk in the very middle of the room. She saw she would have to read it standing(and anyway there were no chairs) and also that she would have to stand with her back tothe door while she read it. So at once she turned to shut the door.

It wouldn't shut.

Some people may disagree with Lucy about this, but I think she was quite right. She saidshe wouldn't have minded if she could have shut the door, but that it was unpleasant tohave to stand in a place like that with an open doorway right behind your back. I shouldhave felt just the same. But there was nothing else to be done.

One thing that worried her a good deal was the size of the Book. The Chief Voice had notbeen able to give her any idea whereabouts in the Book the spell for making thingsvisible came. He even seemed rather surprised at her asking. He expected her to begin atthe beginning and go on till she came to it; obviously he had never thought that there wasany other way of finding a place in a book. "But it might take me days and weeks!" saidLucy, looking at the huge volume, "and I feel already as if I'd been in this place forhours."

She went up to the desk and laid her hand on the book; her fingers tingled when shetouched it as if it were full of electricity. She tried to open it but couldn't at first; this,however, was only because it was fastened by two leaden clasps, and when she hadundone these it opened easily enough. And what a book it was!

It was written, not printed; written in a clear, even hand, with thick downstrokes and thinupstrokes, very large, easier than print, and so beautiful that Lucy stared at it for a wholeminute and forgot about reading it. The paper was crisp and smooth and a nice smellcame from it; and in the margins, and round the big coloured capital letters at thebeginning of each spell, there were pictures.

There was no title page or title; the spells began straight away, and at first there wasnothing very important in them. They were cures for warts (by washing your hands inmoonlight in a silver basin) and toothache and cramp, and a spell for taking a swarm ofbees. The picture of the man with toothache was so lifelike that it would have set your

own teeth aching if you looked at it too long, and the golden bees which were dotted allround the fourth spell looked for a moment as if they were really flying.

Lucy could hardly tear herself away from that first page, but when she turned over, thenext was just as interesting. "But I must get on," she told herself. And on she went forabout thirty pages which, if she could have remembered them, would have taught herhow to find buried treasure, how to remember things forgotten, how to forget things youwanted to forget, how to tell whether anyone was speaking the truth, how to call up (orprevent) wind, fog, snow, sleet or rain, how to produce enchanted sleeps and how to givea man an ass's head (as they did to poor Bottom). And the longer she read the morewonderful and more real the pictures became.

Then she came to a page which was such a blaze of pictures that one hardly noticed thewriting. Hardly - but she did notice the first words. They were, An infallible spell tomake beautiful her that uttereth it beyond the lot of mortals. Lucy peered at the pictureswith her face close to the page, and though they had seemed crowded and muddlesomebefore, she found she could now see them quite clearly. The first was a picture of a girlstanding at a reading-desk reading in a huge book. And the girl was dressed exactly likeLucy. In the next picture Lucy (for the girl in the picture was Lucy herself) was standingup with her mouth open and a rather terrible expression on her face, chanting or recitingsomething. In the third picture the beauty beyond the lot of mortals had come to her. Itwas strange, considering how small the pictures had looked at first, that the Lucy in thepicture now seemed quite as big as the real Lucy; and they looked into each other's eyesand the real Lucy looked away after a few minutes because she was dazzled by the beautyof the other Lucy; though she could still see a sort of likeness to herself in that beautifulface. And now the pictures came crowding on her thick and fast. She saw herself thronedon high at a great tournament in Calormen and all the Kings of the world fought becauseof her beauty. After that it turned from tournaments to real wars, and all Narnia andArchenland, Telmar and Calormen, Galma and Terebinthia, were laid waste with the furyof the kings and dukes and great lords who fought for her favour. Then it changed andLucy, still beautiful beyond the lot of mortals, was back in England. And Susan (who hadalways been the beauty of the family) came home from America. The Susan in the picturelooked exactly like the real Susan only plainer and with a nasty expression. And Susanwas jealous of the dazzling beauty of Lucy, but that didn't matter a bit because no onecared anything about Susan now.

"I will say the spell," said Lucy. "I don't care. I will."

She said I don't care because she had a strong feeling that she mustn't.

But when she looked back at the opening words of the spell, there in the middle of thewriting, where she felt quite sure there had been no picture before, she found the greatface of a lion, of The Lion, Aslan himself, staring into hers. It was painted such a brightgold that it seemed to be coming towards her out of the page; and indeed she never wasquite sure afterwards that it hadn't really moved a little. At any rate she knew the

expression on his face quite well. He was growling and you could see most of his teeth.

She became horribly afraid and turned over the page at once.

A little later she came to a spell which would let you know what your friends thoughtabout you. Now Lucy had wanted very badly to try the other spell, the one that made youbeautiful beyond the lot of mortals. So she felt that to make up for not having said it, shereally would say this one. And all in a hurry, for fear her mind would change, she said thewords (nothing will induce me to tell you what they were). Then she waited forsomething to happen.

As nothing happened she began looking at the pictures. And all at once she saw the verylast thing she expected - a picture of a third-class carriage in a train, with two schoolgirlssitting in it. She knew them at once. They were Marjorie Preston and Anne Featherstone.

Only now it was much more than a picture. It was alive. She could see the telegraph postsflicking past outside the window. Then gradually (like when the radio is "coming on")she could hear what they were saying.

"Shall I see anything of you this term?" said Anne, "or are you still going to be all takenup with Lucy Pevensie. "

"Don't know what you mean by taken up," said Marjorie.

"Oh yes, you do," said Anne. "You were crazy about her last term."

"No, I wasn't," said Marjorie. "I've got more sense than that. Not a bad little kid in herway. But I was getting pretty tired of her before the end of term."

"Well, you jolly well won't have the chance any other term!" shouted Lucy. "Two-facedlittle beast." But the sound of her own voice at once reminded her that she was talking toa picture and that the real Marjorie was far away in another world.

"Well," said Lucy to herself, "I did think better of her than that. And I did all sorts ofthings for her last term, and I stuck to her when not many other girls would. And sheknows it too. And to Anne Featherstone of all people! I wonder are all my friends thesame? There are lots of other pictures. No. I won't look at any more. I won't, I won't' andwith a great effort she turned over the page, but not before a large, angry tear hadsplashed on it.

On the next page she came to a spell "for the refreshment of the spirit'. The pictures werefewer here but very beautiful. And what Lucy found herself reading was more like a storythan a spell. It went on for three pages and before she had read to the bottom of the pageshe had forgotten that she was reading at all. She was living in the story as if it were real,and all the pictures were real too. When she had got to the third page and come to theend, she said, "That is the loveliest story I've ever read or ever shall read in my wholelife. Oh, I wish I could have gone on reading it for ten years. At least I'll read it overagain."

But here part of the magic of the Book came into play. You couldn't turn back. The right-

hand pages, the ones ahead, could be turned; the left-hand pages could not.

"Oh, what a shame!" said Lucy. "I did so want to read it again. Well, at least I mustremember it. Let's see . . . it was about . . . about . . . oh dear, it's all fading away again.

And even this last page is going blank. This is a very queer book. How can I haveforgotten? It was about a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill, I know that much.

But I can't remember and what shall I do?"

And she never could remember; and ever since that day what Lucy means by a good storyis a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the Magician's Book.

She turned on and found to her surprise a page with no pictures at all; but the first wordswere A Spell to make hidden things visible. She read it through to make sure of all thehard words and then said it out loud. And she knew at once that it was working becauseas she spoke the colours came into the capital letters at the top of the page and thepictures began appearing in the margins. It was like when you hold to the fire somethingwritten in Invisible Ink and the writing gradually shows up; only instead of the dingycolour of lemon juice (which is the easiest Invisible Ink) this was all gold and blue andscarlet. They were odd pictures and contained many figures that Lucy did not much likethe look of. And then she thought, "I suppose I've made everything visible, and not onlythe Thumpers. There might be lots of other invisible things hanging about a place likethis. I'm not sure that I want to see them all."

At that moment she heard soft, heavy footfalls coming along the corridor behind her; andof course she remembered what she had been told about the Magician walking in his barefeet and making no more noise than a cat. It is always better to turn round than to haveanything creeping up behind your back. Lucy did so.

Then her face lit up till, for a moment (but of course she didn't know it), she lookedalmost as beautiful as that other Lucy in the picture, and she ran forward with a little cryof delight and with her arms stretched out. For what stood in the doorway was Aslanhimself, The Lion, the highest of all High Kings. And he was solid and real and warmand he let her kiss him and bury herself in his shining mane. And from the low,earthquake-like sound that came from inside him, Lucy even dared to think that he waspurring.

"Oh, Aslan," said she, "it was kind of you to come."

"I have been here all the time," said he, "but you have just made me visible."

"Aslan!" said Lucy almost a little reproachfully. "Don't make fun of me. As if anything 1could do would make you visible!"

"It did," said Aslan. "Do you think I wouldn't obey my own rules?"

After a little pause he spoke again.

"Child," he said, "I think you have been eavesdropping."

"Eavesdropping?"

"You listened to what your two schoolfellows were saying about you."

"Oh that? I never thought that was eavesdropping, Aslan. Wasn't it magic?"

"Spying on people by magic is the same as spying on them in any other way. And youhave misjudged your friend. She is weak, but she loves you. She was afraid of the oldergirl and said what she does not mean."

"I don't think I'd ever be able to forget what I heard her say."

"No, you won't."

"Oh dear," said Lucy. "Have I spoiled everything? Do you mean we would have gone onbeing friends if it hadn't been for this - and been really great friends - all our livesperhaps- and now we never shall."

"Child," said Aslan, "did I not explain to you once before that no one is ever told whatwould have happened?"

"Yes, Aslan, you did," said Lucy. "I'm sorry. But please -"

"Speak on, dear heart."

"Shall I ever be able to, read that story again; the one I couldn't remember? Will you tellit to me, Aslan? Oh do, do, do."

"Indeed, yes, I will tell it to you for years and years. But now, come. We must meet themaster of this house."
