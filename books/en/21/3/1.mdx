title: CHAPTER 1. THE PICTURE IN THE BEDROOM
---

THERE was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it. Hisparents called him Eustace Clarence and masters called him Scrubb. I can't tell you howhis friends spoke to him, for he had none. He didn't call his Father and Mother "Father"and "Mother", but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people.

They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers and wore a special kind ofunderclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on bedsand the windows were always open.

Eustace Clarence liked animals, especially beetles, if they were dead and pinned on acard. He liked books if they were books of information and had pictures of grainelevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools.

Eustace Clarence disliked his cousins the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund andLucy. But he was quite glad when he heard that Edmund and Lucy were coming to stay.

For deep down inside him he liked bossing and bullying; and, though he was a puny littleperson who couldn't have stood up even to Lucy, let alone Edmund, in a fight, he knewthat there are dozens of ways to give people a bad time if you are in your own home andthey are only visitors.

Edmund and Lucy did not at all want to come and stay with Uncle Harold and AuntAlberta. But it really couldn't be helped. Father had got a job lecturing in America forsixteen weeks that summer, and Mother was to go with him because she hadn't had a realholiday for ten years. Peter was working very hard for an exam and he was to spend theholidays being coached by old Professor Kirke in whose house these four children hadhad wonderful adventures long ago in the war years. If he had still been in that house hewould have had them all to stay. But he had somehow become poor since the old daysand was living in a small cottage with only one bedroom to spare. It would have cost toomuch money to take the other three all to America, and Susan had gone.

Grown-ups thought her the pretty one of the family and she was no good at school work(though otherwise very old for her age) and Mother said she "would get far more out of atrip to America than the youngsters". Edmund and Lucy tried not to grudge Susan herluck, but it was dreadful having to spend the summer holidays at their Aunt's. "But it's farworse for me," said Edmund, "because you'll at least have a room of your own and I shallhave to share a bedroom with that record stinker, Eustace."

The story begins on an afternoon when Edmund and Lucy were stealing a few preciousminutes alone together. And of course they were talking about Narnia, which was thename of their own private and secret country. Most of us, I suppose, have a secret countrybut for most of us it is only an imaginary country. Edmund and Lucy were luckier thanother people in that respect. Their secret country was real. They had already visited ittwice; not in a game or a dream but in reality. They had got there of course by Magic,which is the only way of getting to Narnia. And a promise, or very nearly a promise, hadbeen made them in Narnia itself that they would some day get back. You may imaginethat they talked about it a good deal, when they got the chance.

They were in Lucy's room, sitting on the edge of her bed and looking at a picture on theopposite wall. It was the only picture in the house that they liked. Aunt Alberta didn't likeit at all (that was why it was put away in a little back room upstairs), but she couldn't getrid of it because it had been a wedding present from someone she did not want to offend.

It was a picture of a ship - a ship sailing straight towards you. Her prow was gilded andshaped like the head of a dragon with wide-open mouth. She had only one mast and onelarge, square sail which was a rich purple. The sides of the ship - what you could see ofthem where the gilded wings of the dragon ended-were green. She had just run up to thetop of one glorious blue wave, and the nearer slope of that wave came down towards you,with streaks and bubbles on it. She was obviously running fast before a gay wind, listingover a little on her port side. (By the way, if you are going to read this story at all, and ifyou don't know already, you had better get it into your head that the left of a ship whenyou are looking ahead, is port, and the right is starboard.) All the sunlight fell on her fromthat side, and the water on that side was full of greens and purples. On the other, it wasdarker blue from the shadow of the ship.

"The question is," said Edmund, "whether it doesn't make things worse, looking at aNarnian ship when you can't get there."

"Even looking is better than nothing," said Lucy. "And she is such a very Narnian ship."

"Still playing your old game?" said Eustace Clarence, who had been listening outside thedoor and now came grinning into the room. Last year, when he had been staying with thePevensies, he had managed to hear them all talking of Narnia and he loved teasing themabout it. He thought of course that they were making it all up; and as he was far toostupid to make anything up himself, he did not approve of that.

"You're not wanted here," said Edmund curtly.

"I'm trying to think of a limerick," said Eustace. "Something like this:

"Some kids who played games about Narnia Got gradually balmier and balmier-"

"Well Narnia and balmier don't rhyme, to begin with," said Lucy.

"It's an assonance," said Eustace.

"Don't ask him what an assy-thingummy is," said Edmund. "He's only longing to beasked. Say nothing and perhaps he'll go away."

Most boys, on meeting a reception like this, would either have cleared out or flared up.

Eustace did neither. He just hung about grinning, and presently began talking again.

"Do you like that picture?" he asked.

"For heaven's sake don't let him get started about Art and all that," said Edmundhurriedly, but Lucy, who was very truthful, had already said, "Yes, I do. I like it verymuch."

"It's a rotten picture," said Eustace.

"You won't see it if you step outside," said Edmund.

"Why do you like it?" said Eustace to Lucy.

"Well, for one thing," said Lucy, "I like it because the ship looks as if it was reallymoving. And the water looks as if it was really wet. And the waves look as if they werereally going up and down."

Of course Eustace knew lots of answers to this, but he didn't say anything. The reasonwas that at that very moment he looked at the waves and saw that they did look verymuch indeed as if they were going up and down. He had only once been in a ship (andthen only as far as the Isle of Wight) and had been horribly seasick. The look of thewaves in the picture made him feel sick again. He turned rather green and tried anotherlook. And then all three children were staring with open mouths.

What they were seeing may be hard to believe when you read it in print, but it was almostas hard to believe when you saw it happening. The things in the picture were moving. Itdidn't look at all like a cinema either; the colours were too real and clean and out-of-

doors for that. Down went the prow of the ship into the wave and up went a great shockof spray. And then up went the wave behind her, and her stern and her deck becamevisible for the first time, and then disappeared as the next wave came to meet her and herbows went up again. At the same moment an exercise book which had been lying besideEdmund on the bed flapped, rose and sailed through the air to the wall behind him, andLucy felt all her hair whipping round her face as it does on a windy day. And this was awindy day; but the wind was blowing out of the picture towards them. And suddenly withthe wind came the noises-the swishing of waves and the slap of water against the ship'ssides and the creaking and the overall high steady roar of air and water. But it was thesmell, the wild, briny smell, which really convinced Lucy that she was not dreaming.

"Stop it," came Eustace's voice, squeaky with fright and bad temper. "It's some silly trickyou two are playing. Stop it. I'll tell Alberta - Ow!"

The other two were much more accustomed to adventures, but, just exactly as EustaceClarence said "Ow," they both said "Ow" too. The reason was that a great cold, saltsplash had broken right out of the frame and they were breathless from the smack of it,besides being wet through.

"I'll smash the rotten thing," cried Eustace; and then several things happened at the sametime. Eustace rushed towards the picture. Edmund, who knew something about magic,sprang after him, warning him to look out and not to be a fool. Lucy grabbed at him fromthe other side and was dragged forward. And by this time either they had grown muchsmaller or the picture had grown bigger. Eustace jumped to try to pull it off the wall andfound himself standing on the frame; in front of him was not glass but real sea, and windand waves rushing up to the frame as they might to a rock. He lost his head and clutchedat the other two who had jumped up beside him. There was a second of struggling andshouting, and just as they thought they had got their balance a great blue roller surged upround them, swept them off their feet, and drew them down into the sea. Eustace'sdespairing cry suddenly ended as the water got into his mouth.

Lucy thanked her stars that she had worked hard at her swimming last summer term. It istrue that she would have got on much better if she had used a slower stroke, and also thatthe water felt a great deal colder than it had looked while it was only a picture. Still, shekept her head and kicked her shoes off, as everyone ought to do who falls into deep waterin their clothes. She even kept her mouth shut and her eyes open. They were still quitenear the ship; she saw its green side towering high above them, and people looking at herfrom the deck. Then, as one might have expected, Eustace clutched at her in a panic anddown they both went.

When they came up again she saw a white figure diving off the ship's side. Edmund wasclose beside her now, treading water, and had caught the arms of the howling Eustace.

Then someone else, whose face was vaguely familiar, slipped an arm under her from theother side. There was a lot of shouting going on from the ship, heads crowding togetherabove the bulwarks, ropes being thrown. Edmund and the stranger were fastening ropesround her. After that followed what seemed a very long delay during which her face gotblue and her teeth began chattering. In reality the delay was not very long; they werewaiting till the moment when she could be got on board the ship without being dashedagainst its side. Even with all their best endeavours she had a bruised knee when shefinally stood, dripping and shivering, on the deck. After her Edmund was heaved up, andthen the miserable Eustace. Last of all came the stranger - a golden-headed boy someyears older than herself.

"Ca - Ca - Caspian!" gasped Lucy as soon as she had breath enough. For Caspian it was;Caspian, the boy king of Narnia whom they had helped to set on the throne during theirlast visit. Immediately Edmund recognized him too. All three shook hands and clappedone another on the back with great delight.

"But who is your friend?" said Caspian almost at once, turning to Eustace with hischeerful smile. But Eustace was crying much harder than any boy of his age has a right tocry when nothing worse than a wetting has happened to him, and would only yell out,"Let me go. Let me go back. I don't like it."

"Let you go?" said Caspian. "But where?"

Eustace rushed to the ship's side, as if he expected to see the picture frame hanging abovethe sea, and perhaps a glimpse of Lucy's bedroom. What he saw was blue waves fleckedwith foam, and paler blue sky, both spreading without a break to the horizon. Perhaps wecan hardly blame him if his heart sank. He was promptly sick.

"Hey! Rynelf," said Caspian to one of the sailors. "Bring spiced wine for their Majesties.

You'll need something to warm you after that dip." He called Edmund and Lucy theirMajesties because they and Peter and Susan had all been Kings and Queens of Narnialong before his time. Narnian time flows differently from ours. If you spent a hundredyears in Narnia, you would still come back to our world at the very same hour of the verysame day on which you left. And then, if you went back to Narnia after spending a weekhere, you might find that a thousand Narnian years had passed, or only a day, or no timeat all. You never know till you get there. Consequently, when the Pevensie children hadreturned to Narnia last time for their second visit, it was (for the Narnians) as if KingArthur came back to Britain, as some people say he will. And I say the sooner the better.

Rynelf returned with the spiced wine steaming in a flagon and four silver cups. It was justwhat one wanted, and as Lucy and Edmund sipped it they could feel the warmth goingright down to their toes. But Eustace made faces and spluttered and spat it out and wassick again and began to cry again and asked if they hadn't any Plumptree's VitaminizedNerve Food and could it be made with distilled water and anyway he insisted on beingput ashore at the next station.

"This is a merry shipmate you've brought us, Brother," whispered Caspian to Edmundwith a chuckle; but before he could say anything more Eustace burst out again.

"Oh! Ugh! What on earth's that! Take it away, the horrid thing." .

He really had some excuse this time for feeling a little surprised. Something very curiousindeed had come out of the cabin in the poop and was slowly approaching them. Youmight call it - and indeed it was - a Mouse. But then it was a Mouse on its hind legs andstood about two feet high. A thin band of gold passed round its head under one ear andover the other and in this was stuck a long crimson feather. (As the Mouse's fur was verydark, almost black, the effect was bold and striking.) Its left paw rested on the hilt of asword very nearly as long as its tail. Its balance, as it paced gravely along the swayingdeck, was perfect, and its manners courtly. Lucy and Edmund recognized it at onceReepicheep, the most valiant of all the Talking Beasts of Narnia, and the Chief Mouse. Ithad won undying glory in the second Battle of Beruna. Lucy longed, as she had always

done, to take Reepicheep up in her arms and cuddle him. But this, as she well knew, wasa pleasure she could never have: it would have offended him deeply. Instead, she wentdown on one knee to talk to him.

Reepicheep put forward his left leg, drew back his right, bowed, kissed her hand,straightened himself, twirled his whiskers, and said in his shrill, piping voice:

"My humble duty to your Majesty. And to King Edmund, too." (Here he bowed again.)"Nothing except your Majesties' presence was lacking to this glorious venture."

"Ugh, take it away," wailed Eustace. "I hate mice. And I never could bear performinganimals. They're silly and vulgar and-and sentimental."

"Am I to understand," said Reepicheep to Lucy after a long stare at Eustace, "that thissingularly discourteous person is under your Majesty's protection? Because, if not-"

At this moment Lucy and Edmund both sneezed.

"What a fool I am to keep you all standing here in your wet things," said Caspian. "Comeon below and get changed. I'll give you my cabin of course, Lucy, but I'm afraid we haveno women's clothes on board. You'll have to make do with some of mine. Lead the way,Reepicheep, like a good fellow."

"To the convenience of a lady," said Reepicheep, "even a question of honour must giveway - at least for the moment -" and here he looked very hard at Eustace. But Caspianhustled them on and in a few minutes Lucy found herself passing through the door intothe stern cabin. She fell in love with it at once - the three square windows that looked outon the blue, swirling water astern, the low cushioned benches round three sides of thetable, the swinging silver lamp overhead (Dwarfs' work, she knew at once by its exquisitedelicacy) and the flat gold image of Aslan the Lion on the forward wall above the door.

All this she took in in a flash, for Caspian immediately opened a door on the starboardside, and said, "This'll be your room, Lucy. I'll just get some dry things for myself-" hewas rummaging in one of the lockers while he spoke - "and then leave you to change. Ifyou'll fling your wet things outside the door I'll get them taken to the galley to be dried."

Lucy found herself as much at home as if she had been in Caspian's cabin for weeks, andthe motion of the ship did not worry her, for in the old days when she had been a queen inNarnia she had done a good deal of voyaging. The cabin was very tiny but bright withpainted panels (all birds and beasts and crimson dragons and vines) and spotlessly clean.

Caspian's clothes were too big for her, but she could manage. His shoes, sandals and sea-

boots were hopelessly big but she did not mind going barefoot on board ship. When shehad finished dressing she looked out of her window at the water rushing past and took along deep breath. She felt quite sure they were in for a lovely time.
