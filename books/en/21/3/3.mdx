title: CHAPTER 3. THE LONE ISLANDS
---

"LAND in sight," shouted the man in the bows.

Lucy, who had been talking to Rhince on the poop, came pattering down the ladder andraced forward. As she went she was joined by Edmund, and they found Caspian, Drinianand Reepicheep already on the forecastle. It was a coldish morning, the sky very pale andthe sea very dark blue with little white caps of foam, and there, a little way off on thestarboard bow, was the nearest of the Lone Islands, Felimath, like a low green hill in thesea, and behind it, further off, the grey slopes of its sister Doorn.

"Same old Felimath! Same old Doorn," said Lucy, clapping her hands. "Oh - Edmund,how long it is since you and I saw them last!"

"I've never understood why they belong to Narnia," said Caspian. "Did Peter the HighKing conquer them?"

"Oh no," said Edmund. "They were Narnian before our time - in the days of the WhiteWitch."

(By the way, I have never yet heard how these remote islands became attached to thecrown of Narnia; if I ever do, and if the story is at all interesting, I may put it in someother book.)

"Are we to put in here, Sire?" asked Drinian.

"1 shouldn't think it would be much good landing on Felimath," said Edmund. "It wasalmost uninhabited in our days and it looks as if it was the same still. The people livedmostly on Doorn and a little on Avra - that's the third one; you can't see it yet. They onlykept sheep on Felimath."

"Then we'll have to double that cape, I suppose," said Drinian, "and land on Doorn.

That'll mean rowing."

"I'm sorry we're not landing on Felimath," said Lucy. "I'd like to walk there again. It wasso lonely - a nice kind of loneliness, and all grass and clover and soft sea air."

"I'd love to stretch my legs now too," said Caspian. "I tell you what. Why shouldn't we goashore in the boat and send it back, and then we could walk across Felimath and let theDawn Treader pick us up on the other side?"

If Caspian had been as experienced then as he became later on in this voyage he wouldnot have made this suggestion; but at the moment it seemed an excellent one. "Oh dolet's," said Lucy.

"You'll come, will you?" said Caspian to Eustace, who had come on deck with his handbandaged.

"Anything to get off this blasted boat," said Eustace.

"Blasted?" said Drinian. "How do you mean?"

"In a civilized country like where I come from," said Eustace, "the ships are so big thatwhen you're inside you wouldn't know you were at sea at all."

"In that case you might just as well stay ashore," said Caspian. "Will you tell them tolower the boat, Drinian."

The King, the Mouse, the two Pevensies, and Eustace all got into the boat and werepulled to the beach of Felimath. When the boat had left them and was being rowed backthey all turned and looked round. They were surprised at how small the Dawn Treaderlooked.

Lucy was of course barefoot, having kicked off her shoes while swimming, but that is nohardship if one is going to walk on downy turf. It was delightful to be ashore again and tosmell the earth and grass, even if at first the ground seemed to be pitching up and downlike a ship, as it usually does for a while if one has been at sea. It was much warmer herethan it had been on board and Lucy found the sand pleasant to her feet as they crossed it.

There was a lark singing.

They struck inland and up a fairly steep, though low, hill. At the top of course theylooked back, and there was the Dawn Treader shining like a great bright insect andcrawling slowly north-westward with her oars. Then they went over the ridge and couldsee her no longer.

Doom now lay before them, divided from Felimath by a channel about a mile wide;behind it and to the left lay Avra. The little white town of Narrowhaven on Doorn waseasily seen.

"Hullo! What's this?" said Edmund suddenly.

In the green valley to which they were descending six or seven rough-looking men, allarmed, were sitting by a tree.

"Don't tell them who we are," said Caspian.

"And pray, your Majesty, why not?" said Reepicheep who had consented to ride onLucy's shoulder.

"It just occurred to me," replied Caspian, "that no one here can have heard from Narniafor a long time. It's just possible they may not still acknowledge our over-lordship. Inwhich case it might not be quite safe to be known as the King."

"We have our swords, Sire," said Reepicheep.

"Yes, Reep, I know we have," said Caspian. "But if it is a question of re-conquering thethree islands, I'd prefer to come back with a rather larger army."

By this time they were quite close to the strangers, one of whom - a big black-hairedfellow - shouted out, "A good morning to you."

"And a good morning to you," said Caspian. "Is there still a Governor of the LoneIslands?"

"To be sure there is," said the man, "Governor Gumpas. His Sufficiency is atNarrowhaven. But you'll stay and drink with us."

Caspian thanked him, though neither he nor the others much liked the look of their newacquaintance, and all of them sat down. But hardly had they raised their cups to their lipswhen the black-haired man nodded to his companions and, as quick as lightning, all thefive visitors found themselves wrapped in strong arms. There was a moment's strugglebut all the advantages were on one side, and soon everyone was disarmed and had theirhands tied behind their backs except Reepicheep, writhing in his captor's grip and bitingfuriously.

"Careful with that beast, Tacks," said the Leader. "Don't damage him. He'll fetch the bestprice of the lot, I shouldn't wonder."

"Coward! Poltroon!" squeaked Reepicheep. "Give me my sword and free my paws if youdare."

"Whew!" whistled the slave merchant (for that is what he was). "It can talk! Well I neverdid. Blowed if I take less than two hundred crescents for him." The Calormen crescent,which is the chief coin in those parts, is worth about a third of a pound.

"So that's what you are," said Caspian. "A kidnapper and slaver. I hope you're proud ofit."

"Now, now, now, now," said the slaver. "Don't you start any jaw. The easier you take it,the pleasanter all round, see? I don't do this for fun. I've got my living to make same asanyone else."

"Where will you take us?" asked Lucy, getting the words out with some difficulty.

"Over to Narrowhaven," said the slaver. "For market day tomorrow."

"Is there a British Consul there?" asked Eustace.

"Is there a which?" said the man.

But long before Eustace was tired of trying to explain, the slaver simply said, "Well, I'vehad enough of this jabber. The Mouse is a fair treat but this one would talk the hind legoff a donkey. Off we go, mates."

Then the four human prisoners were roped together, not cruelly but securely, and made tomarch down to the shore. Reepicheep was carried. He had stopped biting on a threat ofhaving his mouth tied up, but he had a great deal to say, and Lucy really wondered howany man could bear to have the things said to him which were said to the slave dealer bythe Mouse. But the slave dealer, far from objecting, only said "Go on" wheneverReepicheep paused for breath, occasionally adding, "It's as good as a play," or, "Blimey,you can't help almost thinking it knows what it's saying!" or "Was it one of you whattrained it?" This so infuriated Reepicheep that in the end the number of things he thoughtof saying all at once nearly suffocated him and he became silent.

When they got down to the shore that looked towards Doorn they found a little villageand a long-boat on the beach and, lying a little further out, a dirty bedraggled lookingship.

"Now, youngsters," said the slave dealer, "let's have no fuss and then you'll have nothingto cry about. All aboard."

At that moment a fine-looking bearded man came out of one of the houses (an inn, Ithink) and said:

"Well, Pug. More of your usual wares?"

The slaver, whose name seemed to be Pug, bowed very low, and said in a wheedling kindof voice, "Yes, please your Lordship."

"How much do you want for that boy?" asked the other, pointing to Caspian.

"Ah," said Pug, "I knew your Lordship would pick on the best. No deceiving yourLordship with anything second rate. That boy, now, I've taken a fancy to him myself. Gotkind of fond of him, I have. I'm that tender-hearted I didn't ever ought to have taken upthis job. Still, to a customer like your Lordship-"

"Tell me your price, carrion," said the Lord sternly. "Do you think I want to listen to therigmarole of your filthy trade?"

"Three hundred crescents, my Lord to your honourable Lordship, but to anyone else -"

"I'll give you a hundred and fifty."

"Oh please, please," broke in Lucy. "Don't separate us, whatever you do. You don't know-" But then she stopped for she saw that Caspian didn't even now want to be known.

"A hundred and fifty, then," said the Lord. "As for you, little maiden, I am sorry I cannotbuy you all. Unrope my boy, Pug. And look - treat these others well while they are inyour hands or it'll be the worse for you."

"Well!" said Pug. "Now who ever heard of a gentleman in my way of business whotreated his stock better than what I do? Well? Why, I treat 'em like my own childen."

"That's likely enough to be true," said the other grimly.

The dreadful moment had now come. Caspian was untied and his new master said, "Thisway, lad," and Lucy burst into tears and Edmund looked very blank. But Caspian lookedover his shoulder and said, "Cheer up. I'm sure it will come all right in the end. So long."

"Now, missie," said Pug. "Don't you start taking on and spoiling your looks for themarket tomorrow. You be a good girl and then you won't have nothing to cry about, see?"

Then they were rowed out to the slave-ship and taken below into a long, rather darkplace, none too clean, where they found many other unfortunate prisoners; for Pug was ofcourse a pirate and had just returned from cruising among the islands and capturing whathe could. The children didn't meet anyone whom they knew; the prisoners were mostlyGalmians and Terebinthians. And there they sat in the straw and wondered what washappening to Caspian and tried to stop Eustace talking as if everyone except himself wasto blame.

Meanwhile Caspian was having a much more interesting time. The man who had boughthim led him down a little lane between two of the village houses and so out into an openplace behind the village. Then he turned and faced him.

"You needn't be afraid of me, boy," he said. "I'll treat you well. I bought you for yourface. You reminded me of someone." '

"May I ask of whom, my Lord?" said Caspian.

"You remind me of my master, King Caspian of Narnia."

Then Caspian decided to risk everything on one stroke.

"My Lord," he said, "I am your master. I am Caspian King of Narnia."

"You make very free," said the other. "How shall I know this is true?"

"Firstly by my face," said Caspian. "Secondly because I know within six guesses whoyou are. You are one of those seven lords of Narnia whom my Uncle Miraz sent to seaand whom I have come out to look for - Argoz, Bern, Octesian, Restimar, Mavramorn, or- or - I have forgotten the others. And finally, if your Lordship will give me a sword I willprove on any man's body in clean battle that I am Caspian the son of Caspian, lawfulKing of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands."

"By heaven," exclaimed the man, "it is his father's very voice and trick of speech. Myliege - your Majesty -" And there in the field he knelt and kissed the King's hand.

"The moneys your Lordship disbursed for our person will be made good from our owntreasury," said Caspian.

"They're not in Pug's purse yet, Sire," said the Lord Bern, for he it was. "And never willbe, I trust. I have moved his Sufficiency the Governor a hundred times to crush this viletraffic in man's flesh."

"My Lord Bern," said Caspian, "we must talk of the state of these Islands. But first whatis your Lordship's own story?"

"Short enough, Sire," said Bern. "I came thus far with my six fellows, loved a girl of theislands, and felt I had had enough of the sea. And there was no purpose in returning toNarnia while your Majesty's uncle held the reins. So I married and have lived here eversince."

"And what is this governor, this Gumpas, like? Does he still acknowledge the King ofNarnia for his lord?"

"In words, yes. All is done in the King's name. But he would not be best pleased to find areal, live King of Narnia coming in upon him. And if your Majesty came before himalone and unarmed - well he would not deny his allegiance, but he would pretend todisbelieve you. Your Grace's life would be in danger. What following has your Majestyin these waters?"

"There is my ship just rounding the point," said Caspian. "We are about thirty swords if itcame to fighting. Shall we not have my ship in and fall upon Pug and free my friendswhom he holds captive?"

"Not by my counsel," said Bern. "As soon as there was a fight two or three ships wouldput out from Narrowhaven to rescue Pug. Your Majesty must work by a show of morepower than you really have, and by the terror of the King's name. It must not come toplain battle. Gumpas is a chicken-hearted man and can be over-awed."

After a little more conversation Caspian and Bern walked down to the coast a little westof the village and there Caspian winded his horn. (This was not the great magic horn ofNarnia, Queen Susan's Horn: he had left that at home for his regent Trumpkin to use ifany great need fell upon the land in the King's absence.) Drinian, who was on the look-

out for a signal, recognized the royal horn at once and the Dawn Treader began standingin to shore. Then the boat put off again and in a few moments Caspian and the Lord Bernwere on deck explaining the situation to Drinian. He, just like Caspian, wanted to lay theDawn Treader alongside the slave-ship at once and board her, but Bern made the sameobjection.

"Steer straight down this channel, captain," said Bern, "and then round to Avra where myown estates are. But first run up the King's banner, hang out all the shields, and send asmany men to the fighting top as you can. And about five bowshots hence, when you getopen sea on your port bow, run up a few signals."

"Signals? To whom?" said Drinian.

"Why, to all the other ships we haven't got but which it might be well that Gumpas thinkswe have."

"Oh, I see," said Drinian rubbing his hands. "And

they'll read our signals. What shall I say? Whole fleet round the South of Avra andassemble at -?"

"Bernstead," said the Lord Bern. "That'll do excellently. Their whole journey - if therewere any ships What Caspian did there would be out of sight from Narrowhaven."

Caspian was sorry for the others languishing in the hold of Pug's slave-ship, but he couldnot help finding the rest of that day enjoyable. Late in the afternoon (for they had to doall by oar), having turned to starboard round the northeast end of Doorn and port again

round the point of Avra, they entered into a good harbour on Avra's southern shore whereBern's pleasant lands sloped down to the water's edge. Bern's people, many of whom theysaw working in the fields, were all freemen and it was a happy and prosperous fief. Herethey all went ashore and were royally feasted in a low, pillared house overlooking thebay. Bern and his gracious wife and merry daughters made them good cheer. But afterdark Bern sent a messenger over by boat to Doorn to order some preparations (he did notsay exactly what) for the following day.
