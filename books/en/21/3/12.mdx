title: CHAPTER 12. THE DARK ISLAND
---

AFTER this adventure they sailed on south and a little east for twelve days with a gentlewind, the skies being mostly clear and the air warm, and saw no bird or fish, except thatonce there were whales spouting a long way to starboard. Lucy and Reepicheep played agood deal of chess at this time. Then on the thirteenth day, Edmund, from the fightingtop, sighted what looked like a great dark mountain rising out of the sea on their portbow.

They altered course and made for this land, mostly by oar, for the wind would not servethem to sail north-east. When evening fell they were still a long way from it and rowedall night. Next morning the weather was fair but a flat calm. The dark mass lay ahead,much nearer and larger, but still very dim, so that some thought it was still a long way offand others thought they were running into a mist.

About nine that morning, very suddenly, it was so close that they could see that it was notland at all, nor even, in an ordinary sense, a mist. It was a Darkness. It is rather hard to

describe, but you will see what it was like if you imagine yourself looking into the mouthof a railway tunnel - a tunnel either so long or so twisty that you cannot see the light atthe far end. And you know what it would be like. For a few feet you would see the railsand sleepers and gravel in broad daylight; then there would come a place where theywere in twilight; and then, pretty suddenly, but of course without a sharp dividing line,they would vanish altogether into smooth, solid blackness. It was just so here. For a fewfeet in front of their bows they could see the swell of the bright greenish-blue water.

Beyond that, they could see the water looking pale and grey as it would look late in theevening. But beyond that again, utter blackness as if they had come to the edge ofmoonless and starless night.

Caspian shouted to the boatswain to keep her back, and all except the rowers rushedforward and gazed from the bows. But there was nothing to be seen by gazing. Behindthem was the sea and the sun, before them the Darkness.

"Do we go into this?" asked Caspian at length.

"Not by my advice," said Drinian.

"The Captain's right," said several sailors.

"I almost think he is," said Edmund.

Lucy and Eustace didn't speak but they felt very glad inside at the turn things seemed tobe taking. But all at once the clear voice of Reepicheep broke in upon the silence.

"And why not?" he said. "Will someone explain to me why not."

No one was anxious to explain, so Reepicheep continued:

"If I were addressing peasants or slaves," he said, "I might suppose that this suggestionproceeded from cowardice. But I hope it will never be told in Narnia that a company ofnoble and royal persons in the flower of their age turned tail because they were afraid ofthe dark."

"But what manner of use would it be ploughing through that blackness?" asked Drinian.

"Use?" replied Reepicheep. "Use, Captain? If by use you mean filling our bellies or ourpurses, I confess it will be no use at all. So far as I know we did not set sail to look forthings useful but to seek honour and adventure. And here is as great an adventure as everI heard of, and here, if we turn back, no tittle impeachment of all our honours."

Several of the sailors said things under their breath that sounded like "Honour beblowed", but Caspian said:

"Oh, bother you, Reepicheep. I almost wish we'd left you at home. All right! If you put itthat way, I suppose we shall have to go on. Unless Lucy would rather not?"

Lucy felt that she would very much rather not, but what she said out loud was, "I'mgame."

"Your Majesty will at least order lights?" said Drinian.

"By all means," said Caspian. "See to it, Captain."

So the three lanterns, at the stern, and the prow and the masthead, were all lit, andDrinian ordered two torches amidships. Pale and feeble they looked in the sunshine. Thenall the men except some who were left below at the oars were ordered on deck and fullyarmed and posted in their battle stations with swords drawn. Lucy and two archers wereposted on the fighting top with bows bent and arrows on the string. Rynelf was in thebows with his line ready to take soundings. Reepicheep, Edmund, Eustace and Caspian,glittering in mail, were with him. Drinian took the tiller.

"And now, in Aslan's name, forward!" cried Caspian. "A slow, steady stroke. And letevery man be silent and keep his ears open for orders."

With a creak and a groan the Dawn Treader started to creep forward as the men began torow. Lucy, up in the fighting top, had a wonderful view of the exact moment at whichthey entered the darkness. The bows had already disappeared before the sunlight had leftthe stern. She saw it go. At one minute the gilded stern, the blue sea, and the sky, were allin broad daylight: next minute the sea and sky had vanished, the stern lantern - which hadbeen hardly noticeable before - was the only thing to show where the ship ended. In frontof the lantern she could see the black shape of Drinian crouching at the tiller. Downbelow her the two torches made visible two small patches of deck and gleamed on swordsand helmets, and forward there was another island of light on the forecastle. Apart fromthat, the fighting top, lit by the masthead light which was only just above her, seemed tobe a little lighted world of its own floating in lonely darkness. And the lights themselves,as always happens with lights when you have to have them at the wrong time of day,looked lurid and unnatural. She also noticed that she was very cold.

How long this voyage into the darkness lasted, nobody knew. Except for the creak of therowlocks and the splash of the oars there was nothing to show that they were moving atall. Edmund, peering from the bows, could see nothing except the reflection of the lanternin the water before him. It looked a greasy sort of reflection, and the ripple made by theiradvancing prow appeared to be heavy, small, and lifeless. As time went on everyoneexcept the rowers began to shiver with cold.

Suddenly, from somewhere - no one's sense of direction was very clear by now - therecame a cry, either of some inhuman voice or else a voice of one in such extremity ofterror that he had almost lost his humanity.

Caspian was still trying to speak - his mouth was too dry - when the shrill voice ofReepicheep, which sounded louder than usual in that silence, was heard.

"Who calls?" it piped. "If you are a foe we do not fear you, and if you are a friend yourenemies shall be taught the fear of us."

"Mercy!" cried the voice. "Mercy! Even if you are only one more dream, have merry.

Take me on board. Take me, even if you strike me dead. But in the name of all merciesdo not fade away and leave me in this horrible land."

"Where are you?" shouted Caspian. "Come aboard and welcome."

There came another cry, whether of joy or terror, and then they knew that someone wasswimming towards them.

"Stand by to heave him up, men," said Caspian.

"Aye, aye, your Majesty," said the sailors. Several crowded to the port bulwark withropes and one, leaning far out over the side, held the torch. A wild, white face appearedin the blackness of the water, and then, after some scrambling and pulling, a dozenfriendly hands had heaved the stranger on board.

Edmund thought he had never seen a wilder-looking man. Though he did not otherwiselook very old, his hair was an untidy mop of white, his face was thin and drawn, and, forclothing, only a few wet rags hung about him. But what one mainly noticed were hiseyes, which were so widely opened that he seemed to have no eyelids at all, and stared asif in an agony of pure fear. The moment his feet reached the deck he said:

"Fly! Fly! About with your ship and fly! Row, row, row for your lives away from thisaccursed shore."

"Compose yourself," said Reepicheep, "and tell us what the danger is. We are not used toflying."

The stranger started horribly at the voice of the Mouse, which he had not noticed before.

"Nevertheless you will fly from here," he gasped. "This is the Island where Dreams cometrue."

"That's the island I've been looking for this long time," said one of the sailors. "Ireckoned I'd find I was married to Nancy if we landed here."

"And I'd find Tom alive again," said another.

"Fools!" said the man, stamping his foot with rage. "That is the sort of talk that broughtme here, and I'd better have been drowned or never born. Do you hear what I say? This is

where dreams -dreams, do you understand, come to life, come real. Not daydreams:dreams."

There was about half a minute's silence and then, with a great clatter of armour, the wholecrew were tumbling down the main hatch as quick as they could and flinging themselveson the oars to row as they had never rowed before; and Drinian was swinging round thetiller, and the boatswain was giving out the quickest stroke that had ever been heard atsea. For it had taken everyone just that halfminute to remember certain dreams they hadhad - dreams that make you afraid of going to sleep again - and to realize what it wouldmean to land on a country where dreams come true.

Only Reepicheep remained unmoved.

"Your Majesty, your Majesty," he said, "are you going to tolerate this mutiny, thispoltroonery? This is a panic, this is a rout."

"Row, row," bellowed Caspian. "Pull for all our lives. Is her head right, Drinian? You cansay what you like, Reepicheep. There are some things no man can face."

"It is, then, my good fortune not to be a man," replied Reepicheep with a very stiff bow.

Lucy from up aloft had heard it all. In an instant that one of her own dreams which shehad tried hardest to forget came back to her as vividly as if she had only just woken fromit. So that was what was behind them, on the island, in the darkness! For a second shewanted to go down to the deck and be with Edmund and Caspian. But what was the use?

If dreams began coming true, Edmund and Caspian themselves might turn into somethinghorrible just as she reached them. She gripped the rail of the fighting top and tried tosteady herself. They were rowing back to the light as hard as they could: it would be allright in a few seconds. But oh, if only it could be all right now!

Though the rowing made a good deal of noise it did not quite conceal the total silencewhich surrounded the ship.

Everyone knew it would be better not to listen, not to strain his ears for any sound fromthe darkness. But no one could help listening. And soon everyone was hearing things.

Each one heard something different.

"Do you hear a noise like . . . like a huge pair of scissors opening and shutting .. . overthere?" Eustace asked Rynelf.

"Hush!" said Rynelf. "I can hear them crawling up the sides of the ship."

"It's just going to settle on the mast," said Caspian.

"Ugh!" said a sailor. "There are the gongs beginning. I knew they would."

Caspian, trying not to look at anything (especially not to keep looking behind him), wentaft to Drinian.

"Drinian," he said in a very low voice. "How long did we take rowing in? - I meanrowing to where we picked up . the stranger."

"Five minutes, perhaps," whispered Drinian. "Why?"

"Because we've been more than that already trying to get out."

Drinian's hand shook on the tiller and a line of cold sweat ran down his face. The sameidea was occurring to everyone on board. "We shall never get out, never get' out,"moaned the rowers. "He's steering us wrong. We're going round and round in circles. Weshall never get out." The stranger, who had been lying in a huddled heap on the deck, satup and burst out into a horrible screaming laugh.

"Never get out!" he yelled. "That's it. Of course. We shall never get out. What a fool Iwas to have thought they would let me go as easily as that. No, no, we shall never getout."

Lucy leant her head on the edge of the fighting top and whispered, "Aslan, Aslan, if everyou loved us at all, send us help now." The darkness did not grow any less, but she beganto feel a little - a very, very little - better. "After all, nothing has really happened to usyet," she thought.

"Look!" cried Rynelf's voice hoarsely from the bows. There was a tiny speck of lightahead, and while they watched a broad beam of light fell from it upon the ship. It did notalter the surrounding darkness, but the whole ship was lit up as if by searchlight. Caspianblinked, stared round, saw the faces of his companions all with wild, fixed expressions.

Everyone was staring in the same direction: behind everyone lay his black, sharply-edgedshadow.

Lucy looked along the beam and presently saw something in it. At first it looked like across, then it looked like an aeroplane, then it looked like a kite, and at last with awhirring of wings it was right overhead and was an albatross. It circled three times roundthe mast and then perched for an instant on the crest of the gilded dragon at the prow. Itcalled out in a strong sweet voice what seemed to be words though no one understoodthem. After that it spread its wings, rose, and began to fly slowly ahead, bearing a little tostarboard. Drinian steered after it not doubting that it offered good guidance. But no oneexcept Lucy knew that as it circled the mast it had whispered to her, "Courage, dearheart," and the voice, she felt sure, was Aslan's, and with the voice a delicious smellbreathed in her face.

In a few moments the darkness turned into a greyness ahead, and then, almost before theydared to begin hoping, they had shot out into the sunlight and were in the warm, blueworld again. And all at once everybody realized that there was nothing to be afraid of and

never had been. They blinked their eyes and looked about them. The brightness of theship herself astonished them: they had half expected to find that the darkness would clingto the white and the green and the gold in the form of some grime or scum. And then firstone, and then another, began laughing.

"I reckon we've made pretty good fools of ourselves," said Rynelf.

Lucy lost no time in coming down to the deck, where she found the others all gatheredround the newcomer. For a long time he was too happy to speak, and could only gaze atthe sea and the sun and feel the bulwarks and the ropes, as if to make sure he was reallyawake, while tears rolled down his cheeks.

"Thank you," he said at last. "You have saved me from . . . but I won't talk of that. Andnow let me know who you are. I am a Telmarine of Narnia, and when I was worthanything men called me the Lord Rhoop."

"And I," said Caspian, "am Caspian, King of Narnia, and I sail to find you and yourcompanions who were my father's friends."

Lord Rhoop fell on his knees and kissed the King's hand. "Sire," he said, "you are theman in all the world I most wished to see. Grant me a boon."

"What is it?" asked Caspian.

"Never to bring me back there," he said. He pointed astern. They all looked. But they sawonly bright blue sea and bright blue sky. The Dark Island and the darkness had vanishedfor ever.

"Why!" cried Lord Rhoop. "You have destroyed it!"

"I don't think it was us," said Lucy.

"Sire," said Drinian, "this wind is fair for the southeast. Shall I have our poor fellows upand set sail? And after that, every man who can be spared, to his hammock."

"Yes," said Caspian, "and let there be grog all round. Heigh-ho, I feel I could sleep theclock round myself."

So all afternoon with great joy they sailed south-east with a fair wind. But nobodynoticed when the albatross had disappeared.
