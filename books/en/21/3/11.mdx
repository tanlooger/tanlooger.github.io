title: CHAPTER 11. THE DUFFLEPUDS MADE HAPPY
---

Lucy followed the great Lion out into the passage and at once she saw coming towardsthem an old man, barefoot, dressed in a red robe. His white hair was crowned with a

chaplet of oak leaves, his beard fell to his girdle, and he supported himself with acuriously carved staff. When he saw Aslan he bowed low and said,

"Welcome, Sir, to the least of your houses."

"Do you grow weary, Coriakin, of ruling such foolish subjects as I have given you here?"

"No," said the Magician, "they are very stupid but there is no real harm in them. I beginto grow rather fond of the creatures. Sometimes, perhaps, I am a little impatient, waitingfor the day when they can be governed by wisdom instead of this rough magic."

"All in good time, Coriakin," said Aslan.

"Yes, all in very good time, Sir," was the answer. "Do you intend to show yourself tothem?"

"Nay," said the Lion, with a little half-growl that meant (Lucy thought) the same as alaugh. "I should frighten them out of their senses. Many stars will grow old and come totake their rest in islands before your people are ripe for that. And today before sunset Imust visit Trumpkin the Dwarf where he sits in the castle of Cair Paravel counting thedays till his master Caspian comes home. I will tell him all your story, Lucy. Do not lookso sad. We shall meet soon again."

"Please, Aslan," said Lucy, "what do you call soon?"

"I call all times soon," said Aslan; and instantly he was vanished away and Lucy wasalone with the Magician.

"Gone!" said he, "and you and I quite crestfallen. It's always like that, you can't keep him;it's not as if he were a tame lion. And how did you enjoy my book?"

"Parts of it very much indeed," said Lucy. "Did you know I was there all the time?"

"Well, of course I knew when I let the Duffers make themselves invisible that you wouldbe coming along presently to take the spell off. I wasn't quite sure of the exact day. And Iwasn't especially on the watch this morning. You see they had made me invisible too andbeing invisible always makes me so sleepy. Heigh-ho - there I'm yawning again. Are youhungry?"

"Well, perhaps I am a little," said Lucy. "I've no idea what the time is."

"Come," said the Magician. "All times may be soon to Aslan; but in my home all hungrytimes are one o'clock."

He led her a little way down the passage and opened a door. Passing in, Lucy foundherself in a pleasant room full of sunlight and flowers. The table was bare when they

entered, but it was of course a magic table, and at a word from the old man the tablecloth,silver, plates, glasses and food appeared.

"I hope that is-what you would like," said he. "I have tried to give you food more like thefood of your own land than perhaps you have had lately."

"It's lovely," said Lucy, and so it was; an omelette, piping hot, cold lamb and green peas,a strawberry ice, lemonsquash to drink with the meal and a cup of chocolate to follow.

But the magician himself drank only wine and ate only bread. There was nothingalarming about him, and Lucy and he were soon chatting away like old friends.

"When will the spell work?" asked Lucy. "Will the Duffers be visible again at once?"

"Oh yes, they're visible now. But they're probably all asleep still; they always take a restin the middle of the day."

"And now that they're visible, are you going to let them off being ugly? Will you makethem as they were before?"

"Well, that's rather a delicate question," said the Magician. "You see, it's only they whothink they were so nice to look at before. They say they've been uglified, but that isn'twhat I called it. Many people might say the change was for the better."

"Are they awfully conceited?"

"They are. Or at least the Chief Duffer is, and he's taught all the rest to be. They alwaysbelieve every word he says."

"We'd noticed that," said Lucy.

"Yes - we'd get on better without him, in a way. Of course I could turn him intosomething else, or even put a spell on him which would make them not believe a word hesaid. But I don't like to do that. It's better for them to admire him than to admire nobody."

"Don't they admire you?" asked Lucy.

"Oh, not me," said the Magician. "They wouldn't admire me."

"What was it you uglified them for - I mean, what they call uglified?"

"Well, they wouldn't do what they were told. Their work is to mind the garden and raisefood - not for me, as they imagine, but for themselves. They wouldn't do it at all if I didn'tmake them. And of course for a garden you want water. There is a beautiful spring abouthalf a mile away up the hill. And from that spring there flows a stream which comes rightpast the garden. All I asked them to do was to take their water from the stream instead oftrudging up to the spring with their buckets two or three times a day and tiring themselves

out besides spilling half of it on the way back. But they wouldn't see it. In the end theyrefused point blank."

"Are they as stupid as all that?" asked Lucy.

The Magician sighed. "You wouldn't believe the troubles I've had with them. A fewmonths ago they were all for washing up the plates and knives before dinner: they said itsaved time afterwards. I've caught them planting boiled potatoes to save cooking themwhen they were dug up. One day the cat got into the dairy and twenty of them were atwork moving all the milk out; no one thought of moving the cat. But I see you'vefinished. Let's go and look at the Duffers now they can be looked at."

They went into another room which was full of polished instruments hard to understand -

such as Astrolabes, Orreries, Chronoscopes, Poesimeters, Choriambuses and Theodolinds- and here, when they had come to the window, the Magician said, "There. There are yourDuffers."

"I don't see anybody," said Lucy. "And what are those mushroom things?"

The things she pointed at were dotted all over the level grass. They were certainly verylike mushrooms, but far too big - the stalks about three feet high and the umbrellas aboutthe same length from edge to edge. When she looked carefully she noticed too that thestalks joined the umbrellas not in the middle but at one side which gave an unbalancedlook to them. And there was something - a sort of little bundle - lying on the grass at thefoot of each stalk. In fact the longer she gazed at them the less like mushrooms theyappeared. The umbrella part was not really round as she had thought at first. It was longerthan it was broad, and it widened at one end. There were a great many of them, fifty ormore.

The clock struck three.

Instantly a most extraordinary thing happened. Each of the "mushrooms" suddenly turnedupside-down. The little bundles which had lain at the bottom of the stalks were heads andbodies. The stalks themselves were legs. But not two legs to each body. Each body had asingle thick leg right under it (not to one side like the leg of a one-legged man) and at theend of it, a single enormous foot-a broadtoed foot with the toes curling up a little so thatit looked rather like a small canoe. She saw in a moment why they had looked likemushrooms. They had been lying flat on their backs each with its single leg straight up inthe air and its enormous foot spread out above it. She learned afterwards that this wastheir ordinary way of resting; for the foot kept off both rain and sun and for a Monopod tolie under its own foot is almost as good as being in a tent.

"Oh, the funnies, the funnies," cried Lucy, bursting into laughter. "Did you make themlike that?"

"Yes, yes. I made the Duffers into Monopods," said the Magician. He too was laughingtill the tears ran down his cheeks. "But watch," he added.

It was worth watching. Of course these little one-footed men couldn't walk or run as wedo. They got about by jumping, like fleas or frogs. And what jumps they made! as if eachbig foot were a mass of springs. And with what a bounce they came down; that was whatmade the thumping noise which had so puzzled Lucy yesterday. For now they werejumping in all directions and calling out to one another, "Hey, lads! We're visible again."

"Visible we are," said one in a tasselled red cap who was obviously the Chief Monopod.

"And what I say is, when chaps are visible, why, they can see one another."

"Ah, there it is, there it is, Chief," cried all the others. "There's the point. No one's got aclearer head than you. You couldn't have made it plainer."

"She caught the old man napping, that little girl did," said the Chief Monopod. "We'vebeaten him this time."

"Just what we were, going to say ourselves," chimed the chorus. "You're going strongerthan ever today, Chief. Keep it up, keep it up."

"But do they dare to talk about you like that?" said Lucy. "They seemed to be so afraid ofyou yesterday. Don't they know you might be listening?"

"That's one of the funny things about the Duffers," said the Magician. "One minute theytalk as if I ran everything and overheard everything and was extremely dangerous. Thenext moment they think they can take me in by tricks that a baby would see through -

bless them!"

"Will they have to be turned back into their proper shapes?" asked Lucy. "Oh, I do hopeit wouldn't be unkind to leave them as they are. Do they really mind very much? Theyseem pretty happy. I say - look at that jump. What were they like before?"

"Common little dwarfs," said he. "Nothing like so nice as the sort you have in Narnia."

"It would be a pity to change them back," said Lucy. "They're so funny: and they're rathernice. Do you think it would make any difference if I told them that?"

"I'm sure it would - if you could get it into their heads."

"Will you come with me and try?"

"No, no. You'll get on far better without me."

"Thanks awfully for the lunch," said Lucy and turned quickly away. She ran down thestairs which she had come up so nervously that morning and cannoned into Edmund at

the bottom. All the others were there with him waiting, and Lucy's conscience smote herwhen she saw their anxious faces and realized how long she had forgotten them.

"It's all right," she shouted. "Everything's all right. The Magician's a brick - and I've seenHim - Aslan."

After that she went from them like the wind and out into the garden. Here the earth wasshaking with the jumps and the air ringing with the shouts of the Monopods. Both wereredoubled when they caught sight of her.

"Here she comes, here she comes," they cried. "Three cheers for the little girl. Ah! Sheput it across the old gentleman properly, she did."

"And we're extremely regrettable," said the Chief Monopod, "that we can't give you thepleasure of seeing us as we were before we were uglified, for you wouldn't believe thedifference, and that's the truth, for there's no denying we're mortal ugly now, so we won'tdeceive you."

"Eh, that we are, Chief, that we are," echoed the others, bouncing like so many toyballoons. "You've said it, you've said it."

"But I don't think you are at all," said Lucy, shouting to make herself heard. "I think youlook very nice."

"Hear her, hear her," said the Monopods. "True for you, Missie. Very nice we look. Youcouldn't find a handsomer lot." They said this without any surprise and did not seem tonotice that they had changed their minds.

"She's a-saying," remarked the Chief Monopod, "as how we looked very nice before wewere uglified."

"True for you, Chief, true for you," chanted the others. "That's what she says. We heardher ourselves."

"I did not," bawled Lucy. "I said you're very nice now."

"So she did, so she did," said the Chief Monopod, "said we were very nice then."

"Hear 'em both, hear 'em both," said the Monopods. "There's a pair for you. Always right.

They couldn't have put it better."

"But we're saying just the opposite," said Lucy, stamping her foot with impatience.

"So you are, to be sure, so you are," said the Monopods. "Nothing like an opposite. Keepit up, both of you."

"You're enough to drive anyone mad," said Lucy, and gave it up. But the Monopodsseemed perfectly contented, and she decided that on the whole the conversation had beena success.

And before everyone went to bed that evening something else happened which madethem even more satisfied with their one-legged condition. Caspian and all the Narnianswent back as soon as possible to the shore to give their news to Rhince and the others onboard the Dawn Treader, who were by now very anxious. And, of course, the Monopodswent with them, bouncing like footballs and agreeing with one another in loud voices tillEustace said, "I wish the Magician would make them inaudible instead of invisible." (Hewas soon sorry he had spoken because then he had to explain that an inaudible thing issomething you can't hear, and though he took a lot of trouble he never felt sure that theMonopods had really understood, and what especially annoyed him was that they said inthe end, "Eh, he can't put things the way our Chief does. But you'll learn, young man.

Hark to him. He'll show you how to say things. There's a speaker for you!") When theyreached the bay, Reepicheep had a brilliant idea. He had his little coracle lowered andpaddled himself about in it till the Monopods were thoroughly interested. He then stoodup in it and said, "Worthy and intelligent Monopods, you do not need boats. Each of youhas a foot that will do instead. Just jump as lightly as you can on the water and see whathappens."

The Chief Monopod hung back and warned the others that they'd find the water powerfulwet, but one or two of the younger ones tried it almost at once; and then a few othersfollowed their example, and at last the whole lot did the same. It worked perfectly. Thehuge single foot of a Monopod acted as a natural raft or boat, and when Reepicheep hadtaught them how to cut rude paddles for themselves, they all paddled about the bay andround the Dawn Treader, looking for all the world like a fleet of little canoes with a fatdwarf standing up in the extreme stern of each. And they had races, and bottles of winewere lowered down to them from the ship as prizes, and the sailors stood leaning over theship's sides and laughed till their own sides ached.

The Duffers were also very pleased with their new name of Monopods, which seemed tothem a magnificent name though they never got it right. "That's what we are," theybellowed, "Moneypuds, Pomonods, Poddymons. Just what it was on the tips of ourtongues to call ourselves." But they soon got it mixed up with their old name of Duffersand finally settled down to calling themselves the Dufflepuds; and that is what they willprobably be called for centuries.

That evening all the Narnians dined upstairs with the Magician, and Lucy noticed howdifferent the whole top floor looked now that she was no longer afraid of it. Themysterious signs on the doors were still mysterious but now looked as if they had kindand cheerful meanings, and even the bearded mirror now seemed funny rather thanfrightening. At dinner everyone had by magic what everyone liked best to eat and drink,and after dinner the Magician did a very useful and beautiful piece of magic. He laid twoblank sheets of parchment on the table and asked Drinian to give him an exact account oftheir voyage up to date: and as Drinian spoke, everything he described came out on the

parchment in fine clear lines till at last each sheet was a splendid map of the EasternOcean, showing Galma, Terebinthia, the Seven Isles, the Lone Islands, Dragon Island,Burnt Island, Deathwater, and the land of the Duffers itself, all exactly the right sizes andin the right positions. They were the first maps ever made of those seas and better thanany that have been made since without magic. For on these, though the towns andmountains looked at first just as they would on an ordinary map, when the Magician lentthem a magnifying glass you saw that they were perfect little pictures of the real things,so that you could see the very castle and slave market and streets in Narrowhaven, allvery clear though very distant, like things seen through the wrong end of a telescope. Theonly drawback was that the coastline of most of the islands was incomplete, for the mapshowed only what Drinianhad seen with his own eyes. When they were finished the.

Magician kept one himself and presented the other to Caspian: it still hangs in hisChamber of Instruments at Cair Paravel. But the Magician could tell them nothing aboutseas or lands further east. He did, however, tell them that about seven years before aNarnian ship had put in at his waters and that she had on board the lords Revilian, Argoz,Mavramorn and Rhoop: so they judged that the golden man they had seen lying inDeathwater must be the Lord Restimar.

Next day, the Magician magically mended the stern of the Dawn Treader where it hadbeen damaged by the Sear Serpent and loaded her with useful gifts. There was a mostfriendly parting, and when she sailed, two hours after noon, all the Dufflepuds paddledout with her to the harbour mouth, and cheered until she was out of sound of theircheering.
