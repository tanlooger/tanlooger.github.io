title: CHAPTER 5. THE STORM AND WHAT CAME OF IT
---

IT was nearly three weeks after their landing that the Dawn Treader was towed out ofNarrowhaven harbour. Very solemn farewells had been spoken and a great crowd hadassembled to see her departure. There had been cheers, and tears too, when Caspian madehis last speech to the Lone Islanders and parted from the Duke and his family, but as theship, her purple sail still flapping idly, drew further from the shore, and the sound ofCaspian's trumpet from the poop came fainter across the water, everyone became silent.

Then she came into the wind. The sail swelled out, the tug cast off and began rowingback, the first real wave ran up under the Dawn Treader's prow, and she was a live shipagain. The men off duty went below, Drinian took the first watch on the poop, and sheturned her head eastward round the south of Avra.

The next few days were delightful. Lucy thought she was the most fortunate girl in theworld; as she woke each morning to see the reflections of the sunlit water dancing on theceiling of her cabin and looked round on all the nice new things she had got in the LoneIslands - seaboots and buskins and cloaks and jerkins and scarves. And then she would goon deck and take a look from the forecastle at a sea which was a brighter blue eachmorning and drink in an air that was a little warmer day by day. After that came breakfastand such an appetite as one only has at sea.

She spent a good deal of time sitting on the little bench in the stern playing chess withReepicheep. It was amusing to see him lifting the pieces, which were far too big for him,with both paws and standing on tiptoes if he made a move near the centre of the board.

He was a good player and when he remembered what he was doing he usually won. Butevery now and then Lucy won because the Mouse did something quite ridiculous likesending a knight into the danger of a queen and castle combined. This happened becausehe had momentarily forgotten it was a game of chess and was thinking of a real battle andmaking the knight do what he would certainly have done in its place. For his mind wasfull of forlorn hopes, death-or-glory charges, and last stands.

But this pleasant time did not last. There came an evening when Lucy, gazing idly asternat the long furrow or wake they were leaving behind them, saw a great rack of cloudsbuilding itself up in the west with amazing speed.

Then a gap was torn in it and a yellow sunset poured through the gap. All the wavesbehind them seemed to take on unusual shapes and the sea was a drab or yellowish colourlike dirty canvas. The air grew cold. The ship seemed to move uneasily as if she feltdanger behind he The sail would be flat and limp one minute and wildly the next. Whileshe was noting these things and wondering at a sinister change which had come over thevery noise the wind, Drinian cried, "All hands on deck." In a moment everyone becamefrantically busy. The hatches wet battened down, the galley fire was put out, men wentaloft to reef the sail. Before they had finished the storm struck them. It seemed to Lucythat a great valley in the sea opened just before their bows, and they rushed down in it,deeper down than she would have believed possible. A great grey hill of water, far higherthan the mast, rushed to meet them; it looked certain death but they were tossed to the topof it. Then the ship seemed to spin round. A cataract of water poured over the deck; thepoop and forecastle were like two islands with a fierce sea between them. aloft the sailorswere lying out along the yard desperate trying to get control of the sail. A broken ropestood out sideways in the wind as straight and stiff as if it was poker.

"Get below, Ma'am," bawled Drinian. And Lucy knowing that landsmen - andlandswomen - are a nuisance to the crew, began to obey. It was not easy. The DawnTreader was listing terribly to starboard and the deck sloped like the roof of a house. Shehad to clamber round to the top of the ladder, holding on to the rail, and the stand bywhile two men climbed up it, and then get down as best she could. It was well she wasalready holding tight for at the foot of the ladder another wave roar across the deck, up toher shoulders. She was already almost wet through with spray and rain but this wascolder. Then she made a dash for the cabin door and got in and shut out for a moment theappalling sight of the speed with which they were rushing into the dark, but not of coursethe horrible confusion of creakings, groanings, snappings, clatterings, roarings andboomings which only sounded more alarming below than they had done on the poop.

And all next day and all the next it went on. It went on till one could hardly evenremember a time before it had begun. And there always had to be three men at the tillerand it was as much as three could do to keep any kind of a course. And there always hadto be men at the pump. And there was hardly any rest for anyone, and nothing could becooked and nothing could be dried, and one man was lost overboard, and they never sawthe sun.

When it was over Eustace made the following entry in his diary.

"3 September. The first day for ages when I have been able to write. We had been drivenbefore a hurricane for thirteen days and nights. I know that because I kept a careful count,though the others all say it was only twelve. Pleasant to be embarked on a dangerousvoyage with people who can't even count right! I have had a ghastly time, up and downenormous waves hour after hour, usually wet to the skin, and not even an attempt atgiving us proper meals. Needless to say there's no wireless or even a rocket, so no chanceof signalling anyone for help. It all proves what I keep on telling them, the madness ofsetting out in a rotten little tub like this. It would be bad enough even if one was with

decent people instead of fiends in human form. Caspian and Edmund are simply brutal tome. The night we lost our mast (there's only a stump left now), though I was not at allwell, they forced me to come on deck and work like a slave. Lucy shoved her oar in bysaying that Reepicheep was longing to go only he was too small. I wonder she doesn't seethat everything that little beast does is all for the sake of showing off. Even at her age sheought to have that amount of sense. Today the beastly boat is level at last and the sun'sout and we have all been jawing about what to do. We have food enough, pretty beastlystuff most of it, to last for sixteen days. (The poultry were all washed overboard. Even ifthey hadn't been, the storm would have stopped them laying.) The real trouble is water.

Two casks seem to have got a leak knocked in them and are empty. (Narnian efficiencyagain.) On short rations, half a pint a day each, we've got enough for twelve days.

(There's still lots of rum and wine but even they realize that would only make themthirstier.)

"If we could, of course, the sensible thing would be to turn west at once and make for theLone Islands. But it took us eighteen days to get where we are, running like mad with agale behind us. Even if we got an east wind it might take us far longer to get back. And atpresent there's no sign of an east wind - in fact there's no wind at all. As for rowing back,it would take far too long and Caspian says the men couldn't row on half a pint of water aday. I'm pretty sure this is wrong. I tried to explain that perspiration really cools peopledown, so the men would need less water if they were working. He didn't take any noticeof this, which is always his way when he can't think of an answer. The others all votedfor going on in the hope of finding land. I felt it my duty to point out that we didn't knowthere was any land ahead and tried to get them to see the dangers of wishful thinking.

Instead of producing a better plan they had the cheek to ask me what I proposed. So I justexplained coolly and quietly that I had been kidnapped and brought away on this idioticvoyage without my consent, and it was hardly my business to get them out of theirscrape.

"4 September. Still becalmed. Very short rations for dinner and I got less than anyone.

Caspian is very clever at helping and thinks I don't see! Lucy for some reason tried tomake up to me by offering me some of hers but that interfering prig Edmund wouldn't lether. Pretty hot sun. Terribly thirsty all evening.

"5 September. Still becalmed and very hot. Feeling rotten all day and am sure I've got atemperature. Of course they haven't the sense to keep a thermometer on board.

"6 September. A horrible day. Woke up in the night knowing I was feverish and musthave a drink of water. Any doctor would have said so. Heaven knows I'm the last personto try to get any unfair advantage but I never dreamed that this water-rationing would bemeant to apply to a sick man. In fact I would have woken the others up and asked forsome only I thought it would be selfish to wake them. So I got up and took my cup andtiptoed out of the Black Hole we slept in, taking great care not to disturb Caspian andEdmund, for they've been sleeping badly since the heat and the short water began. Ialways try to consider others whether they are nice to me or not. I got out all right into thebig room, if you can call it a room, where the rowing benches and the luggage are. The

thing of water is at this end. All was going beautifully, but before I'd drawn a cupful whoshould catch me but that little spy Reep. I tried to explain that I was going on deck for abreath of air (the business about the water had nothing to do with him) and he asked mewhy I had a cup. He made such a noise that the whole ship was roused. They treated mescandalously. I asked, as I think anyone would have, why Reepicheep was sneaking aboutthe water cask in the middle of the night. He said that as he was too small to be any useon deck, he did sentry over the water every night so that one more man could go to sleep.

Now comes their rotten unfairness: they all believed him. Can you beat it?

"I had to apologize or the dangerous little brute would have been at me with his sword.

And then Caspian showed up in his true colours as a brutal tyrant and said out loud foreveryone to hear that anyone found "stealing" water in future would "get two dozen". Ididn't know what this meant till Edmund explained to me. It comes in the sort of booksthose Pevensie kids read.

"After this cowardly threat Caspian changed his tune and started being patronizing. Saidhe was sorry for me and that everyone felt just as feverish as I did and we must all makethe best of it, etc., etc. Odious stuck-up prig. Stayed in bed all day today.

"7 September. A little wind today but still from the west.

Made a few miles eastward with part of the sail, set on what Drinian calls the jury-mast-

that means the bowsprit set upright and tied (they call it "lashed") to the stump of the realmast. Still terribly thirsty.

"8 September. Still sailing east. I stay in my bunk all day now and see no one exceptLucy till the two fiends come to bed. Lucy gives me a little of her water ration. She saysgirls don't get as thirsty as boys. I had often thought this but it ought to be more generallyknown at sea.

"9 September. Land in sight; a very high mountain a long way off to the south-east.

"10 September. The mountain is bigger and clearer but still a long way off. Gulls againtoday for the first time since I don't know how long.

"11 September. Caught some fish and had them for dinner. Dropped anchor at about 7p.m. in three fathoms of water in a bay of this mountainous island. That idiot Caspianwouldn't let us go ashore because it was getting dark and he was afraid of savages andwild beasts. Extra water ration tonight."

What awaited them on this island was going to concern Eustace more than anyone else,but it cannot be told in his words because after September 11 he forgot about keeping hisdiary for a long time.

When morning came, with a low, grey sky but very hot, the adventurers found they werein a bay encircled by such cliffs and crags that it was like a Norwegian fjord. In front of

them, at the head of the bay, there was some level land heavily overgrown with trees thatappeared to be cedars, through which a rapid stream came out. Beyond that was a steepascent ending in a jagged ridge and behind that a vague darkness of mountains which raninto dull-coloured clouds so that you could not see their tops. The nearer cliffs, at eachside of the bay, were streaked here and there with lines of white which everyone knew tobe waterfalls, though at that distance they did not show any movement or make anynoise. Indeed the whole place was very silent and the water of the bay as smooth as glass.

It reflected every detail of the cliffs. The scene would have been pretty in a picture butwas rather oppressive in real life. It was not a country that welcomed visitors.

The whole ship's company went ashore in two boatloads and everyone drank and washeddeliciously in the river and had a meal and a rest before Caspian sent four men back tokeep the ship, and the day's work began. There was everything to be done. The casksmust be brought ashore and the faulty ones mended if possible and all refilled; a tree - apine if they could get it - must be felled and made into a new mast; sails must be repaired;a hunting party organized to shoot any game the land might yield; clothes to be washedand mended; and countless small breakages on board to be set right. For the DawnTreader herself - and this was more obvious now that they saw her at a distance - couldhardly be recognized as the same gallant ship which had left Narrowhaven. She looked acrippled, discoloured hulk which anyone might have taken for a wreck. And her officersand crew were no better - lean, pale, red-eyed from lack of sleep, and dressed in rags.

As Eustace lay under a tree and heard all these plans being discussed his heart sank. Wasthere going to be no rest? It looked as if their first day on the longed-for land was goingto be quite as hard work as a day at sea. Then a delightful idea occurred to him. Nobodywas looking they were all chattering about their ship as if they actually liked the beastlything. Why shouldn't he simply slip away? He would take a stroll inland, find a cool, airyplace up in the mountains, have a good long sleep, and not rejoin the others till the day'swork was over. He felt it would do him good. But he would take great care to keep thebay and the ship in sight so as to be sure of his way back. He wouldn't like to be leftbehind in this country.

He at once put his plan into action. He rose quietly from his place and walked awayamong the trees, taking care to go slowly and in an aimless manner so that anyone whosaw him would think he was merely stretching his legs. He was surprised to find howquickly the noise of conversation died away behind hiin and how very silent and warmand dark green the wood became. Soon he felt he could venture on a quicker and moredetermined stride.

This soon brought him out of the wood. The ground began sloping steeply up in front ofhim. The grass was dry and slippery but manageable if he used his hands as well as hisfeet, and though he panted and mopped his forehead a good deal, he plugged awaysteadily. This showed, by the way, that his new life, little as he suspected it, had alreadydone him some good; the old Eustace, Harold and Alberta's Eustace, would have givenup the climb after about ten minutes.

Slowly, and with several rests, he reached the ridge. Here he had expected to have a viewinto the heart of the island, but the clouds had now come lower and nearer and a sea offog was rolling to meet him. He sat down and looked back. He was now so high that thebay looked small beneath him and miles of sea were visible. Then the fog from themountains closed in all round him, thick but not cold, and he lay down and turned thisway and that to find the most comfortable position to enjoy himself.

But he didn't enjoy himself, or not for very long. He began, almost for the first time in hislife, to feel lonely. At first this feeling grew very gradually. And then he began to worryabout the time. There was not the slightest sound. Suddenly it occurred to him that hemight have been lying there for hours. Perhaps the others had gone! Perhaps they had lethim wander away on purpose simply in order to leave him behind! He leaped up in apanic and began the descent.

At first he tried to do it too quickly, slipped on the steep grass, and slid for several feet.

Then he thought this had carried him too far to the left - and as he came up he had seenprecipices on that side. So he clambered up again, as near as he could guess to the placehe had started from, and began the descent afresh, bearing to his right. After that thingsseemed to be going better. He went very cautiously, for he could not see more than a yardahead, and there was still perfect silence all around him. It is very unpleasant to have togo cautiously when there is a voice inside you saying all the time, "Hurry, hurry, hurry."For every moment the terrible idea of being left behind grew stronger. If he hadunderstood Caspian and the Pevensies at all he would have known, of course, that therewas not the least chance of their doing any such thing. But he had persuaded himself thatthey were all fiends in human form.

"At last!" said Eustace as he came slithering down a slide of loose stones (scree, they callit) and found himself on the level. "And now, where are those trees? There is somethingdark ahead. Why, I do believe the fog is clearing."

It was. The light increased every moment and made him blink. The fog lifted. He was inan utterly unknown valley and the sea was nowhere in sight.
