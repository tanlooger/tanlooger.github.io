title: CHAPTER 13. THE THREE SLEEPERS
---

THE wind never failed but it grew gentler every day till at length the waves were littlemore than ripples, and the ship glided on hour after hour almost as if they were sailing ona lake. And every night they saw that there rose in the east new constellations which noone had ever seen in Narnia and perhaps, as Lucy thought with a mixture of joy and fear,no living eye had seen at all. Those new stars were big and bright and the nights werewarm. Most of them slept on deck and talked far into the night or hung over the ship'sside watching the luminous dance of the foam thrown up by their bows.

On an evening of startling beauty, when the sunset behind them was so crimson andpurple and widely spread that the very sky itself seemed to have grown larger, they camein sight of land on their starboard bow. It came slowly nearer and the light behind themmade it look as if the capes and headlands of this new country were all on fire. Butpresently they were sailing along its coast and its western cape now rose up astern ofthem, black against the red sky and sharp as if it was cut out of cardboard, and then theycould see better what this country was like. It had no mountains but many gentle hillswith slopes like pillows. An attractive smell came from it - what Lucy called "a dim,purple kind of smell", which Edmund said (and Rhince thought) was rot, but Caspiansaid, "I know what you mean."

They sailed on a good way, past point after point, hoping to find a nice deep harbour, buthad to content themselves in the end with a wide and shallow bay. Though it had seemedcalm out at sea there was of course surf breaking on the sand and they could not bring theDawn Treader as far in as they would have liked. They dropped anchor a good way fromthe beach and had a wet and tumbling landing in the boat. The Lord Rhoop remained onboard the Dawn Treader. He wished to see no more islands. All the time that theyremained in this country the sound of the long breakers was in their ears.

Two men were left to guard the boat and Caspian led the others inland, but not farbecause it was too late for exploring and the light would soon go. But there was no needto go far to find an adventure. The level valley which lay at the head of the bay showedno road or track or other sign of habitation. Underfoot was tine springy turf dotted hereand there with a low bushy growth which Edmund and Lucy took for heather. Eustace,who was really rather good at botany; said it wasn't, and he was probably right; but it wassomething of very much the same kind.

When they had gone less than a bowshot from the shore, Drinian said, "Look! What'sthat?" and everyone stopped.

"Are they great trees?" said Caspian.

"Towers, l think," said Eustace.

"It might be giants," said Edmund in a lower voice.

"The way to find out is to go right iv among them," said Reepicheep, drawing his swordand pattering off ahead of everyone else.

"I think it's a ruin," said Lucy when they had got a good deal nearer, and her guess wasthe best so far. What they now saw was a wide oblong space flagged with smooth stonesand surrounded by grey pillars but unroofed. And from end to end of it ran a long tablelaid with a rich crimson cloth that came down nearly to the pavement. At either side of itwere many chairs of stone richly carved and with silken cushions upon the seats. But onthe table itself there was set out such a banquet as had never been seen, not even whenPeter the High King kept his court at Cair Paravel. There were turkeys and geese andpeacocks, there were boars' heads and sides of venison, there were pies shaped like shipsunder full sail or like dragons and elephants, there were ice puddings and bright lobstersand gleaming salmon, there were nuts and grapes, pineapples and peaches, pomegranatesand melons and tomatoes. There were flagons of gold and silver and curiouslywroughtglass; and the smell of the fruit and the wine blew towards them like a promise of allhappiness.

"I say!" said Lucy.

They came nearer and nearer, all very quietly.

"But where are the guests?" asked Eustace.

"We can provide that, Sir," said Rhince.

"Look!" said Edmund sharply. They were actually within the pillars now and standing onthe pavement. Everyone looked where Edmund had pointed. The chairs were not allempty. At the head of the table and in the two places beside it there was something- orpossibly three somethings.

"What are those?" asked Lucy in a whisper. "It looks like three beavers sitting on thetable."

"Or a huge bird's nest," said Edmund.

"It looks more like a haystack to me," said Caspian.

Reepicheep ran forward, jumped on a chair and thence on to the table, and ran along it,threading his way as nimbly as a dancer between jewelled cups and pyramids of fruit and-ivory salt-cellars. He ran right up to the mysterious grey mass at the end: peered,touched, and then called out:

"These will not fight, I think."

Everyone now came close and saw that what sat in those three chairs was three men,though hard to recognize as men till you looked closely. Their hair, which was grey, had

grown over their eyes till it almost concealed their, faces, and their beards had grownover the table, climbing pound and entwining plates and goblets as brambles; entwine afence, until, all mixed in one great mat of hair, they flowed over the edge and down to thefloor. And from their heads the hair hung over the backs of their chairs so that they werewholly hidden. In fact the three men were; nearly all hair.

"Dead?" said Caspian.

"I think not, Sire," said Reepicheep, lifting one of their hands out of its tangle of hair inhis two paws. "This one is warm and his pulse beats."

"This one, too, and this," said Drinian.

"Why, they're only asleep," said Eustace.

"It's been a long sleep, though," said Edmund, "to let their hair grow like this."

"It must be an enchanted sleep," said Lucy. "I felt the moment we landed on this islandthat it was full of magic. Oh! do you think we have perhaps come here to break it?"

"We can try," said Caspian, and began shaking the nearest of the three sleepers. For amoment everyone thought he was going to be successful, for the man breathed hard andmuttered, "I'll go eastward no more. Out oars for Narnia." But he sank back almost atonce into a yet deeper sleep than before: that is, his heavy head sagged a few incheslower towards the table and all efforts to rouse him again were useless. With the second itwas much the same. "Weren't born to live like animals. Get to the east while you've achance - lands behind the sun," and sank down. And the third only said, "Mustard,please," and slept hard.

"Out oars for Narnia, eh?" said Drinian.

"Yes," said Caspian, "you are right, Drinian. I think our quest is at an end. Let's look attheir rings. Yes, these are their devices. This is the Lord Revilian. This is the Lord Argoz:and this, the Lord Mavramorn."

"But we can't wake them," said Lucy. "What are we to do?"

"Begging your Majesties' pardons all," said Rhince, "but why not fall to while you'rediscussing it? We don't see a dinner like this every day."

"Not for your life!" said Caspian.

"That's right, that's right," said several of the sailors.

"Too much magic about here. The sooner we're back on board the better."

"Depend upon it," said Reepicheep, "it was from eating this food that these three lordscame by a seven years' sleep."

"I wouldn't touch it to save my life," said Drinian.

"The light's going uncommon quick," said Rynelf.

"Back to ship, back to ship," muttered the men.

"I really think," said Edmund, "they're right. We can decide what to do with the threesleepers tomorrow. We daren't eat the food and there's no point in staying here for thenight. The whole place smells of magic - and danger."

"I am entirely of King Edmund's opinion," said Reepicheep, "as far as concerns the ship'scompany in general. But I myself will sit at this table till sunrise."

"Why on earth?" said Eustace.

"Because," said the Mouse, "this is a very great adventure, and no danger seems to me sogreat as that of knowing when I get back to Narnia that I left a mystery behind methrough fear."

"I'll stay with you, Reep," said Edmund.

"And I too," said Caspian.

"And me," said Lucy. And then Eustace volunteered also. This was very brave of himbecause never having read of such things or even heard of them till he joined the DawnTreader made it worse for him than for the others.

"I beseech your Majesty -" began Drinian.

"No, my Lord," said Caspian. "Your place is with the ship, and you have had a day'swork while we five have idled." There was a lot of argument about this but in the endCaspian had his way. As the crew marched off to the shore in the gathering dusk none ofthe five watchers, except perhaps Reepicheep, could avoid a cold feeling in the stomach.

They took some time choosing their seats at the perilous table. Probably everyone had thesame reason but no one said it out loud. For it was really a rather nasty choice. One couldhardly bear to sit all night next to those three terrible hairy objects which, if not dead,were certainly not alive in the ordinary sense. On the other hand, to sit at the far end, sothat you would see them less and less as the night grew darker, and wouldn't know if theywere moving, and perhaps wouldn't see them at all by about two o'clock no, it was not tobe thought of. So they sauntered round and round the table saying, "What about here?"and "Or perhaps a bit further on," or, "Why not on this side?" till at last they settled downsomewhere about the middle but nearer to the sleepers than to the other end. It was about

ten by now and almost dark. Those strange new constellations burned in the east. Lucywould have liked it better if they had been the Leopard and the Ship and other old friendsof the Narnian sky.

They wrapped themselves in their sea cloaks and sat still and waited. At first there wassome attempt at talk but it didn't come to much. And they sat and sat. And all the timethey heard the waves breaking on the beach.

After hours that seemed like ages there came a moment when they all knew they hadbeen dozing a moment before but were all suddenly wide awake. The stars were all inquite different positions from those they had last noticed. The sky was very black exceptfor the faintest possible greyness in the east. They were cold, though thirsty, and stiff.

And none of them spoke because now at last something was happening.

Before them, beyond the pillars, there was the slope of a low hill. And now a door openedin the hillside, and light appeared in the doorway, and a figure came out, and the doorshut behind it. The figure carried a light, and this light was really all that they could seedistinctly. It came slowly nearer and nearer till at last it stood right at the table opposite tothem. Now they could see that it was a tall girl, dressed in a single long garment of clearblue which left her arms bare. She was bareheaded and her yellow hair hung down herback. And when they looked at her they thought they had never before known whatbeauty meant.

The light which she had been carrying was a tall candle in a silver candlestick which shenow set upon the table. If there had been any wind off the sea earlier in the night it musthave died down by now, for the flame of the candle burned as straight and still as if itwere in a room with the windows shut and the curtains drawn. Gold and silver on thetable shone in its light.

Lucy now noticed something lying lengthwise on the table which had escaped herattention before. It was a knife of stone, sharp as steel, a cruel-looking, ancient lookingthing.

No one had yet spoken a word. Then - Reepicheep first, and Caspian next - they all roseto their feet, because they felt that she was a great lady.

"Travellers who have come from far to Aslan's table," said the girl. "Why do you not eatand drink?"

"Madam," said Caspian, "we feared the food because we thought it had cast our friendsinto an enchanted sleep.

"They have never tasted it," she said.

"Please," said Lucy, "what happened to them?"

"Seven years ago," said the girl, "they came here in a ship whose sails were rags andtimbers ready to fall apart. There were a few others with them, sailors, and when theycame to this table one said, `Here is the good place. Let us set sail and reef sail and rowno longer but sit down and end our days in peace!' And the second said, `No, let us re-

embark and sail for Narnia and the west; it may be that Miraz is dead.' But the third, whowas a very masterful man, leaped up and said, `No, by heaven. We are men andTelmarines, not brutes. What should we do but seek adventure after adventure? We havenot long to live in any event. Let us spend what is left in seeking the unpeopled worldbehind the sunrise.' And as they quarrelled he caught up the Knife of Stone which liesthere on the table and would have fought with his comrades. But it is a thing not right forhim to touch. And as his fingers closed upon the hilt, deep sleep fell upon all the three.

And till the enchantment is undone they will never wake."

"What is this Knife of Stone?" asked Eustace.

"Do none of you know it?" said the girl.

"I - I think," said Lucy, "I've seen something like it before. It was a knife like it that theWhite Witch used when she killed Aslan at the Stone Table long ago."

"It was the same.," said the girl, "and it was brought here to be kept in honour while theworld lasts."

Edmund, who had been looking more and more uncomfortable for the last few minutes,now spoke.

"Look here," he said, "I hope I'm not a coward - about eating this food, I mean - and I'msure I don't mean to be rude. But we have had a lot of queer adventures on this voyage ofours and things aren't always what they seem. When I look in your face I can't helpbelieving all you say: but then that's just what might happen with a witch too. How arewe to know you're a friend?"

"You can't know," said the girl. "You can only believe or not."

After a moment's pause Reepicheep's small voice was heard.

"Sire," he said to Caspian, "of your courtesy fill my cup with wine from that flagon: it istoo big for me to lift. I will drink to the lady."

Caspian obeyed and the Mouse, standing on the table, held up a golden cup between itstiny paws and said, "Lady, I pledge you." Then it fell to on cold peacock, and in a shortwhile everyone else followed its example. All were very hungry and the meal, if not quitewhat you wanted for a very early breakfast, was excellent as a very late supper.

"Why is it called Aslan's table?" asked Lucy presently.

"It is set here by his bidding," said the girl, "for those who come so far. Some call thisisland the World's End, for though you can sail further, this is the beginning of the end."

"But how does the food keep?" asked the practical Eustace. ?

"It is eaten, and renewed every day," said the girl. "This you will see."

"And what are we to do about the Sleepers?" asked Caspian. "In the world from whichmy friends come" (here, he nodded at Eustace and the Pevensies) "they have a story of aprince or a king coming to a castle where all the people lay in an enchanted sleep. In thatstory he could not dissolve the enchantment until he had kissed the Princess."

"But here," said the girl, "it is different. Here he cannot kiss the Princess till he hasdissolved the enchantment."

"Then," said Caspian, "in the name of Aslan, show me how to set about that work atonce."

"My father will teach you that," said the girl.

"Your father!" said everyone. "Who is he? And where?"

"Look," said the girl, turning round and pointing at the door in the hillside. They couldsee it more easily now, for while they had been talking the stars had grown fainter andgreat gaps of white light were appearing in the greyness of the eastern sky.
