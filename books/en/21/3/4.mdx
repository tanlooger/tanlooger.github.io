title: CHAPTER 4. WHAT CASPIAN DID THERE
---

Nert morning the Lord Bern called his guests early, and after breakfast he asked Caspianto order every man he had into full armour. "And above all," he added, "let everything beas trim and scoured as if it were the morning of the first battle in a great war betweennoble kings with all the world looking on." This was done; and then in three boatloadsCaspian and his people, and Bern with a few of his, put out for Narrowhaven. The king'sflag flew in the stern of his boat and his trumpeter was with him.

When they reached the jetty at Narrowhaven, Caspian found a considerable crowdassembled to meet them. "This is what I sent word about last night," said Bern. "They areall friends of mine and honest people." And as soon as Caspian stepped ashore the crowdbroke out into hurrahs and shouts of, "Narnia! Narnia! Long live the King." At the samemoment - and this was also due to Bern's messengers - bells began ringing from manyparts of the town. Then Caspian caused his banner to be advanced and his trumpet to beblown and every man drew his sword and set his face into a joyful sternness, and theymarched up the street so that the street shook, and their armour shone (for it was a sunnymorning) so that one could hardly look at it steadily.

At first the only people who cheered were those who had been warned by Bern'smessenger and knew what was happening and wanted it to happen. But then all thechildren joined in because they liked a procession and had seen very few. And then allthe schoolboys joined in because they also liked processions and felt that the more noiseand disturbance there was the less likely they would be to have any school that morning.

And then all the old women put their heads out of doors and windows and beganchattering and cheering because it was a king, and what is a governor compared withthat? And all the young women joined in for the same reason and also because Caspianand Drinian and the rest were so handsome. And then all the young men came to see whatthe young women were looking at, so that by the time Caspian reached the castle gates,nearly the whole town was shouting; and where Gumpas sat in the castle, muddling andmessing about with accounts and forms and rules and regulations, he heard the noise.

At the castle gate Caspian's trumpeter blew a blast and cried, "Open for the King ofNarnia, come to visit his trusty and wellbeloved servant the governor of the LoneIslands." In those days everything in the islands was done in a slovenly, slouchingmanner. Only the little postern opened, and out came a tousled fellow with a dirty old haton his head instead of a helmet, and a rusty old pike in his hand. He blinked at theflashing figures before him. "Carn - seez - fishansy," he mumbled which was his way ofsaying, -"You can't see his Sufficiency"). "No interviews without 'pointments 'cept 'tweennine 'n' ten p.m. second Saturday every month."

"Uncover before Narnia, you dog," thundered the Lord Bern, and dealt him a rap with hisgauntleted hand which sent his hat flying from his head.

"'Ere? Wot's it all about?" began the doorkeeper, but no one took any notice of him. Twoof Caspian's men stepped through the postern and after some struggling with bars andbolts (for everything was rusty) flung both wings of the gate wide open. Then the Kingand his followers strode into the courtyard. Here a number of the governor's guards werelounging about and several more (they were mostly wiping their mouths) came tumblingout of various doorways. Though their armour was in a disgraceful condition, these werefellows who might have fought if they had been led or had known what was happening;so this was the dangerous moment. Caspian gave them no time to think.

"Where is the captain?" he asked.

"I am, more or less, if you know what I mean," said a languid and rather dandified youngperson without any j armour at all.

"It is our wish," said Caspian, "that our royal visitation to our realm of the Lone Islandsshould, if possible, be an occasion of joy and not of terror to our loyal subjects. If it werenot for that, I should have something to say about the state of your men's armour andweapons. As it is, you are pardoned. Command a cask of wine to be opened that, yourmen may drink our health. But at noon tomorrow I wish to see them here in this courtyardlooking like men-at-arms and not like vagabonds. See to it on pain of our extremedispleasure."

The captain gaped but Bern immediately cried, "Three. cheers for the King," and thesoldiers, who had understood about the cask of wine even if they understood nothing else,joined in. Caspian then ordered most of his own men to remain in the courtyard. He, withBern and Drinian and four others, went into the hall.

Behind a table at the far end with various secretaries about him sat his Sufficiency, theGovernor of the Lone Islands. Gumpas was a bilious-looking man with hair that had oncebeen red and was now mostly grey. He glanced up as the strangers entered and thenlooked down at his papers saying automatically, "No interviews without appointmentsexcept between nine and ten p.m. on second Saturdays."

Caspian nodded to Bern and then stood aside. Bern and Drinian took a step forward andeach seized one end of the table. They lifted it, and flung it on one side of the hall whereit rolled over, scattering a cascade of letters, dossiers, ink-pots, pens, sealing-wax anddocuments. Then, not roughly but as firmly as if their hands were pincers of steel, theyplucked Gumpas out of his chair and deposited him, facing it, about four feet away.

Caspian at once sat down in the chair and laid his naked sword across his knees.

"My Lord," said he, fixing his eyes on Gumpas, "you have not given us quite thewelcome we expected. I am the King of Narnia."

"Nothing about it in the correspondence," said the governor. "Nothing in the minutes. Wehave not been notified of any such thing. All irregular. Happy to consider anyapplications-"

"And we are come to enquire into your Sufficiency's conduct of your office," continuedCaspian. "There are two points especially on which I require an explanation. Firstly I findno record that the tribute due from these Islands to the crown of Narnia has been receivedfor about a hundred and fifty years."

"That would be a question to raise at the Council next month," said Gumpas. "If anyonemoves that a commission of enquiry be set up to report on the financial history of theislands at the first meeting next year, why then . . ."

"I also find it very clearly written in our laws," Caspian went on, "that if the tribute is notdelivered the whole debt has to be paid by the Governor of the Lone Islands out of hisprivate purse."

At this Gumpas began to pay real attention. "Oh, that's quite out of the question," he said.

"It is an economic impossibility - er - your Majesty must be joking."

Inside, he was wondering if there were any way of getting rid of these unwelcomevisitors. Had he known that Caspian had only one ship and one ship's company with him,he would have spoken soft words for the moment, and hoped to have them all surroundedand killed during the night. But he had seen a ship of war sail down the straits yesterdayand seen it signalling, as he supposed, to its consorts. He had not then known it was theKing's ship for there was not wind enough to spread the flag out and make the golden lionvisible, so he had waited further developments. Now he imagined that Caspian had awhole fleet at Bernstead. It would never have occurred to Gumpas that anyone wouldwalk into Narrowhaven to take the islands with less than fifty men; it was certainly not atall the kind of thing he could imagine doing himself.

"Secondly," said Caspian, "I want to know why you have permitted this abominable andunnatural traffic in slaves to grow up here, contrary to the ancient custom and usage ofour dominions."

"Necessary, unavoidable," said his Sufficiency. "An essential part of the economicdevelopment of the islands, I assure you. Our present burst of prosperity depends on it."

"What need have you of slaves?"

"For export, your Majesty. Sell 'em to Calormen mostly; and we have other markets. Weare a great centre of the trade."

"In other words," said Caspian, "you don't need them. Tell me what purpose they serveexcept to put money into the pockets of such as Pug?"

"Your Majesty's tender years," said Gumpas, with what was meant to be a fatherly smile,"hardly make it possible that you should understand the economic problem involved. Ihave statistics, I have graphs, I have-"

"Tender as my years be," said Caspian, "I believe I understand the slave trade fromwithin quite as well as your Sufficiency. And I do not see that it brings into the islandsmeat or bread or beer or wine or timber or cabbages or books or instruments of music orhorses or armour or anything else worth having. But whether it does or not, it must bestopped."

"But that would be putting the clock back," gasped the governor. "Have you no idea ofprogress, of development?"

"I have seen them both in an egg," said Caspian. "We call it `Going Bad' in Narnia. Thistrade must stop."

"I can take no responsibility for any such measure," said Gumpas.

"Very well, then," answered Caspian, "we relieve you of your office. My Lord Bern,come here." And before Gumpas quite realized what was happening, Bern was kneelingwith his hands between the King's hands and taking the oath to govern the Lone Islandsin accordance with the old customs, rights, usages and laws of Narnia. And Caspian said,"I think we have had enough of governors," and made Bern a Duke, the Duke of the LoneIslands.

"As for you, my Lord," he said to Gumpas, "I forgive you your debt for the tribute. Butbefore noon tomorrow you and yours must be out of the castle, which is now the Duke'sresidence."

"Look here, this is all very well," said one of Gumpas's secretaries, "but suppose all yougentlemen stop playacting and we do a little business. The question before us really is-"

"The question is," said the Duke, "whether you and the rest of the rabble will leavewithout a flogging or with one. You may choose which you prefer."

When all this had been pleasantly settled, Caspian ordered horses, of which there were afew in the castle, though very ill-groomed and he, with Bern and Drinian and a fewothers, rode out into the town and made for the slave market. It was a long low buildingnear the harbour and the scene which they found going on inside was very much like anyother auction; that is to say, there was a great crowd and Pug, on a platform, was roaringout in a raucous voice:

"Now, gentlemen, lot twenty-three. Fine Terebinthian agricultural labourer, suitable forthe mines or the galleys. Under twenty-five years of age. Not a bad tooth in his head.

Good, brawny fellow. Take off his shirt, Tacks, and let the gentlemen see. There's musclefor you! Look at the chest on him. Ten crescents from the gentleman in the corner. Youmust be joking, sir. Fifteen! Eighteen! Eighteen is bidden for lot twenty-three. Anyadvance on eighteen? Twenty-one. Thank you, sir. Twenty-one is bidden-"

But Pug stopped and gaped when he saw the mail-clad figures who had clanked up to theplatform.

"On your knees, every man of you, to the King of Narnia," said the Duke. Everyoneheard the horses jingling and stamping outside and many had heard some rumour of thelanding and the events at the castle. Most obeyed. Those who did not were pulled downby their neighbours. Some cheered.

"Your life is forfeit, Pug, for laying hands on our royal person yesterday," said Caspian.

"But your ignorance is pardoned. The slave trade was forbidden in all our dominionsquarter of an hour ago. I declare every slave in this market free."

He held up his hand to check the cheering of the slaves and went on, "Where are myfriends?"

"That dear little gel and the nice young gentleman?" said Pug with an ingratiating smile.

"Why, they were snapped up at once-"

"We're here, we're here, Caspian," cried Lucy and Edmund together and, "At yourservice, Sire," piped Reepicheep from another corner. They had all been sold but the menwho had bought them were staying to bid for other slaves and so they had not yet beentaken away. The crowd parted to let the three of them out and there was greathandclasping and greeting between them and Caspian. Two merchants of Calormen atonce approached. The Calormen have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowingrobes and orange-coloured turbans, and they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel andancient people. They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long compliments, allabout the fountains of prosperity irrigating the gardens of prudence and virtue - andthings like that - but of course what they wanted was the money they had paid.

"That is only fair, sirs," said Caspian. "Every man who has bought a slave today musthave his money back. Pug, bring out your takings to the last minim." (A minim is thefortieth part of a crescent.)

"Does your good Majesty mean to beggar me?" whined Pug.

"You have lived on broken hearts all your life," said Caspian, "and if you are beggared, itis better to be a beggar than a slave. But where is my other friend?"

"Oh him?" said Pug. "Oh take him and welcome. Glad to have him off my hands. I'venever seen such a drug in the market in all my born days. Priced him at five crescents inthe end and even so nobody'd have him. Threw him in free with other lots and still no onewould have him. Wouldn't touch him. Wouldn't look at him. 'Packs, bring out Sulky."

Thus Eustace was produced, and sulky he certainly looked; for though no one wouldwant to be sold as a slave, it is perhaps even more galling to be a sort of utility slavewhom no one will buy. He walked up to Caspian and said, "I see. As usual. Beenenjoying yourself somewhere while the rest of us were prisoners. I suppose you haven'teven found out about the British Consul. Of course not."

That night they had a great feast in the castle of Narrowhaven and then, "Tomorrow forthe beginning of our real adventures!" said Reepicheep when he had made his bows toeveryone and went to bed. But it could not really be tomorrow or anything like it. Fornow they were preparing to leave all known lands and seas behind them and the fullestpreparations had to be made. The Dawn Treader was emptied and drawn on land by eighthorses over rollers and every bit of her was gone over by the most skilled shipwrights.

Then she was launched again and victualled and watered as full as she could hold - that isto say for twenty-eight days. Even this, as Edmund noticed with disappointment, onlygave them a fortnight's eastward sailing before they had to abandon their quest.

While all this was being done Caspian missed no chance of questioning all the oldest seacaptains whom he could find in Narrowhaven to learn if they had any knowledge or evenany rumours of land further to the east. He poured out many a flagon of the castle ale toweather-beaten men with short grey beards and clear blue eyes, and many a tall yarn heheard in return. But those who seemed the most truthful could tell of no lands beyond theLone Islands, and many thought that if you sailed too far east you would come into thesurges of a sea without lands that swirled perpetually round the rim of the world - "Andthat, I reckon, is where your Majesty's friends went to the bottom." The rest had only wildstories of islands inhabited by headless men, floating islands, waterspouts, and a fire thatburned along the water. Only one, to Reepicheep's delight, said, "And beyond that, Aslancountry. But that's beyond the end of the world and you can't get there." But when theyquestioned -him he could only say that he'd heard it from his father.

Bern could only tell them that he had seen his six companions sail away eastward andthat nothing had, ever been heard of them again. He said this when he and Caspian werestanding on the highest point of Avra looking down on the eastern ocean. "I've often beenup here of a morning," said the Duke, "ands seen the sun come up out of the sea, andsometimes it looked as if it were only a couple of miles away. And I've wondered aboutmy friends and wondered what there really is behind that horizon. Nothing, most likely,

yet I am always half ashamed that I stayed behind. But I wish your Majesty wouldn't go.

We may need your help here. This closing the slave market might make a new world; warwith Calormen is what I foresee. My liege, think again."

"I have an oath, my lord Duke," said Caspian. "And anyway, what could I say toReepicheep?"
