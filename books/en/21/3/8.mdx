title: CHAPTER 8. TWO NARROW ESCAPES
---

EVERYONE was cheerful as the Dawn Treader sailed from Dragon Island. They had fairwinds as soon as they were out of the bay and came early next morning to the unknownland which some of them had seen when flying over the mountains while Eustace wasstill a dragon. It was a low green island inhabited by nothing but rabbits and a few goats,but from the ruins of stone huts, and from blackened places where fires had been, theyjudged that it had been peopled not long before. There were also some bones and brokenweapons.

"Pirates' work," said Caspian.

"Or the dragon's," said Edmund.

The only other thing they found there was a little skin boat, or coracle, on the sands. Itwas made of hide stretched over a wicker framework. It was a tiny boat, barely four feetlong, and the paddle which still lay in it was in proportion. They thought that either it hadbeen made for a child or else that the people of that country had been Dwarfs.

Reepicheep decided to keep it, as it was just the right size for him; so it was taken onboard. They called that land Burnt Island, and sailed away before noon.

For some five days they ran before a south-south-east wind, out of sight of all lands andseeing neither fish nor gull. Then they had a day when it rained hard till the afternoon.

Eustace lost two games of chess to Reepicheep and began to get like his old and

disagreeable self again, and Edmund said he wished they could have gone to Americawith Susan. Then Lucy looked out of the stern windows and said:

"Hello! I do believe it's stopping. And what's that?"

They all tumbled up to the poop at this and found that the rain had stopped and thatDrinian, who was on watch, was also staring hard at something astern. Or rather, atseveral things. They looked a little like smooth rounded rocks, a whole line of them withintervals of about forty feet in between.

"But they can't be rocks," Drinian was saying, "because they weren't there five minutesago."

"And one's just disappeared," said Lucy.

"Yes, and there's another one coming up," said Edmund.

"And nearer," said Eustace.

"Hang it!" said Caspian. "The whole thing is moving this way."

"And moving a great deal quicker than we can sail, Sire," said Drinian. "It'll be up withus in a minute."

They all held their breath, for it is not at all nice to be pursued by an unknown somethingeither on land or sea. But what it turned out to be was far worse than anyone hadsuspected. Suddenly, only about the length of a cricket pitch from their port side, anappalling head reared itself out of the sea. It was all greens and vermilions with purpleblotches - except where shell fish clung to it - and shaped rather like a horse's, thoughwithout ears. It had enormous eyes, eyes made for staring through the dark depths of theocean, and a gaping mouth filled with double rows of sharp fish-like teeth. It came up onwhat they first took to be a huge neck, but as more and more of it emerged everyoneknew that this was not its neck but its body and that at last they were seeing what somany people have foolishly wanted to see - the great Sea Serpent. The folds of itsgigantic tail could be seen far away, rising at intervals from the surface. And now its headwas towering up higher than the mast.

Every man rushed to his weapon, but there was nothing to be done, the monster was outof reach. "Shoot! Shoot!" cried the Master Bowman, and several obeyed, but the arrowsglanced off the Sea Serpent's hide as if it was ironplated. Then, for a dreadful minute,everyone was still, staring up at its eyes and mouth and wondering where it wouldpounce.

But it didn't pounce. It shot its head forward across the ship on a level with the yard ofthe mast. Now its head was just beside the fighting top. Still it stretched and stretched tillits head was over the starboard bulwark. Then down it began to come - not on to the

crowded deck but into the water, so that the whole ship was under an arch of serpent.

And almost at once that arch began to get smaller: indeed on the starboard the SeaSerpent was now almost touching the Dawn Treader's side.

Eustace (who had really been trying very hard to behave well, till the rain and the chessput him back) now did the first brave thing he had ever done. He was wearing a swordthat Caspian had lent him. As soon as the serpent's body was near enough on thestarboard side he jumped on to the bulwark and began hacking at it with all his might. Itis true that he accomplished nothing beyond breaking Caspian's second-best sword intobits, but it was a fine thing for a beginner to have done.

Others would have joined him if at that moment Reepicheep had not called out, "Don'tfight! Push!" It was so unusual for the Mouse to advise anyone not to fight that, even inthat terrible moment, every eye turned to him. And when he jumped up on to thebulwark, forward of the snake, and set his little furry back against its huge scaly, slimyback, and began pushing as hard as he could, quite a number of people saw what hemeant and rushed to both sides of the ship to do the same. And when, a moment later, theSea Serpent's head appeared again, this time on the port side, and this time with its backto them, then everyone understood.

The brute had made a loop of itself round the Dawn Treader and was beginning to drawthe loop tight. When it got quite tight - snap! - there would be floating matchwood wherethe ship had been and it could pick them out of the water one by one. Their only chancewas to push the loop backward till it slid over the stern; or else (to put the same thinganother way) to push the ship forward out of the loop.

Reepicheep alone had, of course, no more chance of doing this than of lifting up acathedral, but he had nearly killed himself with trying before others shoved him aside.

Very soon the whole ship's company except Lucy and the Mouse (which was fainting)was in two long lines along the two bulwarks, each man's chest to the back of the man infront, so that the weight of the whole line was in the last man, pushing for their lives. Fora few sickening seconds (which seemed like hours) nothing appeared to happen. Jointscracked, sweat dropped, breath came in grunts and gasps. Then they felt that the ship wasmoving. They saw that the snake-loop was further from the mast than it had been. Butthey also saw that it was smaller. And now the real danger was at hand. Could they get itover the poop, or was it already too tight? Yes. It would just fit. It was resting on thepoop rails. A dozen or more sprang up on the poop. This was far better. The Sea Serpent'sbody was so low now that they could make a line across the poop and push side by side.

Hope rose high till everyone remembered the high carved stern, the dragon tail, of theDawn Treader. It would be quite impossible to get the brute over that.

"An axe," cried Caspian hoarsely, "and still shove." Lucy, who knew where everythingwas, heard him where she was standing on the main deck staring up at the poop. In a fewseconds she had been below, got the axe, and was rushing up the ladder to the poop. Butjust as she reached the top there came a great crashing noise like a tree coming down andthe ship rocked and darted forward. For at that very moment, whether because the Sea

Serpent was being pushed so hard, or because it foolishly decided to draw the noose tight,the whole of the carved stern broke off and the ship was free.

The others were too exhausted to see what Lucy saw. There, a few yards behind them, theloop of Sea Serpent's body got rapidly smaller and disappeared into a splash. Lucyalways said (but of course she was very excited at the moment, and it may have been onlyimagination) that she saw a look of idiotic satisfaction on the creature's face. What iscertain is that it was a very stupid animal, for instead of pursuing the ship it turned itshead round and began nosing all along its own body as if it expected to find the wreckageof the Dawn Treader there. But the Dawn Treader was already well away, running beforea fresh breeze, and the men lay and sat panting and groaning all about the deck, tillpresently they were able to talk about it, and then to laugh about it. And when some rumhad been served out they even raised a cheer; and everyone praised the valour of Eustace(though it hadn't done any good) and of Reepicheep.

After this they sailed for three days more and saw nothing but sea and sky. On the fourthday the wind changed to the north and the seas began to rise; by the afternoon it hadnearly become a gale. But at the same time they sighted land on their port bow.

"By your leave, Sire," said Drinian, "we will try to get under the lee of that country byrowing and lie in harbour, maybe till this is over." Caspian agreed, but a long row againstthe gale did not bring them to the land before evening. By the last light of that day theysteered into a natural harbour and anchored, but no one went ashore that night. In themorning they found themselves in the green bay of a rugged, lonely-looking countrywhich sloped up to a rocky summit. From the windy north beyond that summit cloudscame streaming rapidly. They lowered the boat and loaded

her with any of the water casks which were now empty.

"Which stream shall we water at, Drinian?" said Caspian as he took his seat in the stern-

sheets of the boat. "There seem to be two coming down into the bay."

"It makes little odds, Sire," said Drinian. "But I think it's a shorter pull to that on thestarboard-the eastern one."

"Here comes the rain," said Lucy.

"I should think it does!" said Edmund, for it was already pelting hard. "I say, let's go tothe other stream. There are trees there and we'll have some shelter."

"Yes, let's," said Eustace. "No point in getting wetter than we need."

But all the time Drinian was steadily steering to the starboard, like tiresome people incars who continue at forty miles an hour while you are explaining to them that they areon the wrong road.

"They're right, Drinian," said Caspian. "Why don't you bring her head round and makefor the western stream?"

"As your Majesty pleases," said Drinian a little shortly. He had had an anxious day withthe weather yesterday, and he didn't like advice from landsmen. But he altered course;and it turned out afterwards that it was a good thing he did.

By the time they had finished watering, the rain was over and Caspian, with Eustace, thePevensies, and Reepicheep, decided to walk up to the top of the hill and see what couldbe seen. It was a stiffish climb through coarse grass and heather and they saw neither mannor beast, except seagulls. When they reached the top they saw that it was a very smallisland, not more than twenty acres; and from this height the sea looked larger and moredesolate than it did from the deck, or even the fighting top, of the Dawn Treader.

"Crazy, you know," said Eustace to Lucy in a low voice, looking at the eastern horizon.

"Sailing on and on into that with no idea what we may get to." But he only said it out ofhabit, not really nastily as he would have done at one time.

It was too cold to stay long on the ridge for the wind still blew freshly from the north.

"Don't let's go back the same way," said Lucy as they turned; "let's go along a bit andcome down by the other stream, the one Drinian wanted to go to."

Everyone agreed to this and after about fifteen minutes they were at the source of thesecond river. It was a more interesting place than they had expected; a deep littlemountain lake, surrounded by cliffs except for a narrow channel on the seaward side outof which the water flowed. Here at last they were out of the wind, and all sat down in theheather above the cliff for a rest.

All sat down, but one (it was Edmund) jumped up again very quickly.

"They go in for sharp stones on this island," he said, groping about in the heather. "Whereis the wretched thing? . . . Ah, now I've got it . . . Hullo! It wasn't a stone at all, it's asword-hilt. No, by jove, it's a whole sword; what the rust has left of it. It must have lainhere for ages."

"Narnian, too, by the look of it," said Caspian, as they all crowded round.

"I'm sitting on something too," said Lucy. "Something hard." It turned out to be theremains of a mail-shirt. By this time everyone was on hands and knees, feeling in thethick heather in every direction. Their search revealed, one by one, a helmet, a dagger,and a few coins; not Calormen crescents but genuine Narnian "Lions" and "Trees" suchas you might see any day in the market-place of Beaversdam or Beruna.

"Looks as if this might be all that's left of one of our seven lords," said Edmund.

"Just what I was thinking," said Caspian. "I wonder which it was. There's nothing on thedagger to show. And I wonder how he died."

"And how we are to avenge him," added Reepicheep.

Edmund, the only one of the party who had read several detective stories, had meanwhilebeen thinking.

"Look here," he said, "there's something very fishy about this. He can't have been killedin a fight."

"Why not?" asked Caspian.

"No bones," said Edmund. "An enemy might take the armour and leave the body. Butwho ever heard of a chap who'd won a fight carrying away the body and leaving thearmour?"

"Perhaps he was killed by a wild animal," Lucy suggested.

"It'd be a clever animal," said Edmund, "that would take a man's mail shirt off."

"Perhaps a dragon?" said Caspian.

"Nothing doing," said Eustace. "A dragon couldn't do it. I ought to know."

"Well, let's get away from the place, anyway," said Lucy. She had not felt like sittingdown again since Edmund had raised the question of bones.

"If you like," said Caspian, getting up. "I don't think any of this stuff is worth takingaway."

They came down and round to the little opening where the stream came out of the lake,and stood looking at the deep water within the circle of cliffs. If it had been a hot day, nodoubt some would have been tempted to bathe and everyone would have had a drink.

Indeed, even as it was, Eustace was on the very point of stooping down and scooping upsome water in his hands when Reepicheep and Lucy both at the same moment cried,"Look," so he forgot about his drink and looked.

The bottom of the pool was made of large greyish-blue stones and the water wasperfectly clear, and on the bottom lay a life-size figure of a man, made apparently ofgold. It lay face downwards with its arms stretched out above its head. And it sohappened that as they looked at it, the clouds parted and the sun shone out. The goldenshape was lit up from end to end. Lucy thought it was the most beautiful statue she hadever seen.

"Well!" whistled Caspian. "That was worth coming to see! I wonder, can we get it out?"

"We can dive for it, Sire," said Reepicheep.

"No good at all," said Edmund. "At least, if it's really gold - solid gold - it'll be far tooheavy to bring up. And that pool's twelve or fifteen feet deep if it's an inch. Half amoment, though. It's a good thing I've brought a hunting spear with me. Let's see whatthe depth is like. Hold on to my hand, Caspian, while I lean out over the water a bit."Caspian took his hand and Edmund, leaning forward, began to lower his spear into thewater.

Before it was half-way in Lucy said, "I don't believe the statue is gold at all. It's only thelight. Your spear looks just the same colour."

"What's wrong?" asked several voices at once; for Edmund had suddenly let go of thespear.

"I couldn't hold it," gasped Edmund, "it seemed so heavy."

"And there it is on the bottom now," said Caspian, "and Lucy is right. It looks just thesame colour as the statue."

But Edmund, who appeared to be having some trouble with his boots - at least he wasbending down and looking at them - straightened himself all at once and shouted out inthe sharp voice which people hardly ever disobey:

"Get back! Back from the water. All of you. At once!!"

They all did and stared at him.

"Look," said Edmund, "look at the toes of my boots."

"They look a bit yellow," began Eustace.

"They're gold, solid gold," interrupted Edmund. "Look at them. Feel them. The leather'spulled away from it already. And they're as heavy as lead."

"By Aslan!" said Caspian. "You don't mean to say-?"

"Yes, I do," said Edmund. "That water turns things into gold. It turned the spear intogold, that's why it got so heavy. And it was just lapping against my feet (it's a good thingI wasn't barefoot) and it turned the toe-caps into gold. And that poor fellow on the bottom- well, you see."

"So it isn't a statue at all," said Lucy in a low voice.

"No. The whole thing is plain now. He was here on a hot day. He undressed on top of thecliff - where we were sitting. The clothes have rotted away or been taken by birds to linenests with; the armour's still there. Then he dived and -"

"Don't," said Lucy. "What a horrible thing."

"And what a narrow shave we've had," said Edmund.

"Narrow indeed," said Reepicheep. "Anyone's finger, anyone's foot, anyone's whisker, oranyone's tail, might have slipped into the water at any moment."

"All the same," said Caspian, "we may as well test it." He stooped down and wrenched upa spray of heather. Then, very cautiously, he knelt beside the pool and dipped it in. It washeather that he dipped; what he drew out was a perfect model of heather made of thepurest gold, heavy and soft as lead.

"The King who owned this island," said Caspian slowly, and his face flushed as he spoke,"would soon be the richest of all the Kings of the world. I claim this land for ever as aNarnian possession. It shall be called Goldwater Island. And I bind all of you to secrecy.

No one must know of this. Not even Drinian - on pain of death, do you hear?"

"Who are you talking to?" said Edmund. "I'm no subject of yours. If anything it's theother way round. I am one of the four ancient sovereigns of Narnia and you are underallegiance to the High King my brother."

"So it has come to that, King Edmund, has it?" said Caspian, laying his hand on hissword-hilt.

"Oh, stop it, both of you," said Lucy. "That's the worst of doing anything with boys.

You're all such swaggering, bullying idiots - oooh! -" Her voice died away into a gasp.

And everyone else saw what she had seen.

Across the grey hillside above them - grey, for the heather was not yet in bloom - withoutnoise, and without looking at them, and shining as if he were in bright sunlight though thesun had in fact gone in, passed with slow pace the hugest lion that human eyes have everseen. In describing the scene Lucy said afterwards, "He was the size of an elephant,"though at another time she only said, "The size of a cart-horse." But it was not the sizethat mattered. Nobody dared to ask what it was. They knew it was Aslan.

And nobody ever saw how or where he went. They looked at one another like peoplewaking from sleep.

"What were we talking about?" said Caspian. "Have I been making rather an ass ofmyself?"

"Sire," said Reepicheep, "this is a place with a curse on it. Let us get back on board atonce. And if I might have the honour of naming this island, I should call it Deathwater."

"That strikes me as a very good name, Reep," said Caspian, "though now that I come tothink of it, I don't know why. But the weather seems to be settling and I dare say Drinianwould like to be off. What a lot we shall have to tell him."

But in fact they had not much to tell for the memory of the last hour had all becomeconfused.

"Their Majesties all seemed a bit bewitched when they came aboard," said Drinian toRhince some hours later when the Dawn Treader was once more under sail andDeathwater Island already below the horizon. "Something happened to them in that place.

The only thing I could get clear was that they think they've found the body of one ofthese lords we're looking for."

"You don't say so, Captain," answered Rhince. "Well, that's three. Only four more. Atthis rate we might be home soon after the New Year. And a good thing too. My baccy'srunning a bit low. Good night, Sir."
