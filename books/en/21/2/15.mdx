title: CHAPTER 15. ASLAN MAKES A DOOR IN THE AIR
---

AT the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of coldgravy, their knees knocked together, and many fell on their faces. They had not believed

in lions and this made their fear greater. Even the Red Dwarfs, who knew that he came asa friend, stood with open mouths and could not speak. Some of the Black Dwarfs, whohad been of Nikabrik's party, began to edge away. But all the Talking Beasts surgedround the Lion, with purrs and grunts and squeaks and whinneys of delight, fawning onhim with their tails, rubbing against him, touching him reverently with their noses andgoing to and fro under his body and between his legs. If you have ever seen a little catloving a big dog whom it knows and trusts, you will have a pretty good picture of theirbehaviour. Then Peter, leading Caspian, forced his way through the crowd of animals.

"This is Caspian, Sir," he said. And Caspian knelt and kissed the Lion's paw.

"Welcome, Prince," said Aslan. "Do you feel yourself sufficient to take up the Kingshipof Narnia?"

"I - I don't think I do, Sir," said Caspian. "I'm only a kid."

"Good," said Aslan. "If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof thatyou were not. Therefore, under us and under the High King, you shall be King of Narnia,Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands. You and your heirs while yourrace lasts. And your coronation - but what have we here?" For at that moment a curiouslittle procession was approaching - eleven Mice, six of whom carried between themsomething on a litter made of branches, but the litter was no bigger than a large atlas. Noone has ever seen mice more woebegone than these. They were plastered with mud somewith blood too - and their ears were down and their whiskers drooped and their tailsdragged in the grass, and their leader piped on his slender pipe a melancholy tune. On thelitter lay what seemed little better than a damp heap of fur; all that was left ofReepicheep. He was still breathing, but more dead than alive, gashed with innumerablewounds, one paw crushed, and, where his tail had been, a bandaged stump.

"Now, Lucy," said Aslan.

Lucy had her diamond bottle out in a moment. Though only a drop was needed on eachof Reepicheep's wounds, the wounds were so many that there was a long and anxioussilence before she had finished and the Master Mouse sprang from the litter. His handwent at once to his sword hilt, with the other he twirled his whiskers. He bowed.

"Hail, Aslan!" came his shrill voice. "I have the honour -" But then he suddenly stopped.

The fact was that he still had no tail - whether that Lucy had forgotten it or that hercordial, though it could heal wounds, could not make things grow again. Reepicheepbecame aware of his loss as he made his bow; perhaps it altered something in his balance.

He looked over his right shoulder. Failing to see his tail, he strained his neck further tillhe had to turn his shoulders and his whole body followed. But by that time his hind-

quarters had turned too and were out of sight. Then he strained his neck looking over hisshoulder again, with the same result. Only after he had turned completely round threetimes did he realize the dreadful truth.

"I am confounded," said Reepicheep to Aslan. "I am completely out of countenance. Imust crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly fashion."

"It becomes you very well, Small One," said Aslan.

"All the same," replied Reepicheep, "if anything could be done... Perhaps her Majesty?"and here he bowed to Lucy.

"But what do you want with a tail?" asked Aslan.

"Sir," said the Mouse, "I can eat and sleep and die for my King without one. But a tail isthe honour and glory of a Mouse."

"I have sometimes wondered, friend," said Aslan, "whether you do not think too muchabout your honour."

"Highest of all High Kings," said Reepicheep, "permit me to remind you that a very smallsize has been bestowed on us Mice, and if we did not guard our dignity, some (whoweigh worth by inches) would allow themselves very unsuitable pleasantries at ourexpense. That is why I have been at some pains to make it known that no one who doesnot wish to feel this sword as near his heart as I can reach shall talk in my presence aboutTraps or Toasted Cheese or Candles: no, Sir - not the tallest fool in Narnia!" Here heglared very fiercely up at Wimbleweather, but the Giant, who was always a stage behindeveryone else, had not yet discovered what was being talked about down at his feet, andso missed the point.

"Why have your followers all drawn their swords, may I ask?" said Aslan.

"May it please your High Majesty," said the second Mouse, whose name was Peepiceek,"we are all waiting to cut off our own tails if our Chief must go without his. We will notbear the shame of wearing an honour which is denied to the High Mouse."

"Ah!" roared Aslan. "You have conquered me. You have great hearts. Not for the sake ofyour dignity, Reepicheep, but for the love that is between you and your people, and stillmore for the kindness your people showed me long ago when you ate away the cords thatbound me on the Stone Table (and it was then, though you have long forgotten it, thatyou began to be Talking Mice), you shall have your tail again."

Before Aslan had finished speaking the new tail was in its place. Then, at Aslan'scommand, Peter bestowed the Knighthood of the Order of the Lion on Caspian, andCaspian, as soon as he was knighted, himself bestowed it on Trufflehunter and Trumpkinand Reepicheep, and made Doctor Cornelius his Lord Chancellor, and confirmed theBulgy Bear in his hereditary office of Marshal of the Lists. And there was great applause.

After this the Telmarine soldiers, firmly but without taunts or blows, were taken acrossthe ford and all put under lock and key in the town of Beruna and given beef and beer.

They made a great fuss about wading in the river, for they all hated and feared runningwater just as much as they hated and feared woods and animals. But in the end thenuisance was over: and then the nicest parts of that long day began.

Lucy, sitting close to Aslan and divinely comfortable, wondered what the trees weredoing. At first she thought they were merely dancing; they were certainly going roundslowly in two circles, one from left to right and the other from right to left. Then shenoticed that they kept throwing something down in the centre of both circles. Sometimesshe thought they were cutting off long strands of their hair; at other times it looked as ifthey were breaking off bits of their fingers - but, if so, they had plenty of fingers to spareand it did not hurt them. But whatever they were throwing down, when it reached theground, it became brushwood or dry sticks. Then three or four of the Red Dwarfs cameforward with their tinder boxes and set light to the pile, which first crackled, and thenblazed, and finally roared as a woodland bonfire on midsummer night ought to do. Andeveryone sat down in a wide circle round it.

Then Bacchus and Silenus and the Maenads began a dance, far wilder than the dance ofthe trees; not merely a dance for fun and beauty (though it was that too) but a magicdance of plenty, and where their hands touched, and where their feet fell, the feast cameinto existence sides of roasted meat that filled the grove with delicious smell, andwheaten cakes and oaten cakes, honey and many-coloured sugars and cream as thick asporridge and as smooth as still water, peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, pears, grapes,strawberries, raspberries pyramids and cataracts of fruit. Then, in great wooden cups andbowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark, thick ones like syrups ofmulberry juice, and clear red ones like red jellies liquefied, and yellow wines and greenwines and yellow-green and greenish-yellow.

But for the tree people different fare was provided. When Lucy saw Clodsley Shovel andhis moles scuffling up the turf in various places (which Bacchus had pointed out to them)and realized that the trees were going to eat earth it gave her rather a shudder. But whenshe saw the earths that were actually brought to them she felt quite different. They beganwith a rich brown loam that looked almost exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, infact, that Edmund tried a piece of it, but he did not find it at all nice. When the rich loamhad taken the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of the kind you see inSomerset, which is almost pink. They said it was lighter and sweeter. At the cheese stagethey had a chalky soil, and then went on to delicate confections of the finest gravelspowdered with choice silver sand. They drank very little wine, and it made the Holliesvery talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst with deep draughts of mingleddew and rain, flavoured with forest flowers and the airy taste of the thinnest clouds.

Thus Aslan feasted the Narnians till long after the sunset had died away, and the stars hadcome out; and the great fire, now hotter but less noisy, shone like a beacon in the darkwoods, and the frightened Telmarines saw it from far away and wondered what it mightmean. The best thing of all about this feast was that there was no breaking up or going

away, but as the talk grew quieter and slower, one after another would begin to nod andfinally drop off to sleep with feet towards the fire and good friends on either side, till atlast there was silence all round the circle, and the chattering of water over stone at theFord of Beruna could be heard once more. But all night Aslan and the Moon gazed uponeach other with joyful and unblinking eyes.

Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over thecountry with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines - including, of course, theprisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia wouldhenceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and othercreatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditionsmight do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another home.

Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Ford of Berunaby noon on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of head-scratchingamong the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like Caspian, heardstories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back. They were alreadymaking friends with the creatures. These all decided to stay in Narnia. But most of theolder men, especially those who had been important under Miraz, were sulky and had nowish to live in a country where they could not rule the roost. "Live here with a lot ofblooming performing animals! No fear," they said. "And ghosts too," some added with ashudder. "That's what those there Dryads really are. It's not canny." They were alsosuspicious. "I don't trust 'em," they said. "Not with that awful Lion and all. He won't keephis claws off us long, you'll see." But then they were equally suspicious of his offer togive them a new home. "Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely," theymuttered. And the more they talked to one another the sulkier and more suspicious theybecame. But on the appointed day more than half of them turned up.

At one end of the glade Aslan had caused to be set up two stakes of wood, higher than aman's head and about three feet apart. A third, and lighter, piece of wood was boundacross them at the top, uniting them, so that the whole thing looked like a doorway fromnowhere into nowhere. In front of this stood Aslan himself with Peter on his right andCaspian on his left. Grouped round them were Susan and Lucy, Trumpkin andTrufflehunter, the Lord Cornelius, Glenstorm, Reepicheep, and others. The children andthe Dwarfs had made good use of the royal wardrobes in what had been the castle ofMiraz and was now the castle of Caspian, and what with silk and cloth of gold, withsnowy linen glancing through slashed sleeves, with silver mail shirts and jewelled sword-

hilts, with gilt helmets and feathered bonnets, they were almost too bright to look at.

Even the beasts wore rich chains about their necks. Yet nobody's eyes were on them orthe children. The living and strokable gold of Aslan's mane outshone them all. The rest ofthe Old Narnians stood down each side of the glade. At the far end stood the Telmarines.

The sun shone brightly and pennants fluttered in the light wind.

"Men of Telmar," said Aslan, "you who seek a new land, hear my words. I will send youall to your own country, which I know and you do not."

"We don't remember Telmar. We don't know where it is. We don't know what it is like,"grumbled the Telmarines.

"You came into Narnia out of Telmar," said Aslan. "But you came into Telmar fromanother place. You do not belong to this world at all. You came hither, certaingenerations ago, out of that same world to which the High King Peter belongs."

At this, half the Telmarines began whimpering, "There you are. Told you so. He's goingto kill us all, send us right out of the world," and the other half began throwing out theirchests and slapping one another on the back and whispering, "There you are. Might haveguessed we didn't belong to this place with all its queer, nasty, unnatural creatures. We'reof royal blood, you'll see." And even Caspian and Cornelius and the children turned toAslan with looks of amazement on their faces.

"Peace," said Aslan in the low voice which was nearest to his growl. The earth seemed toshake a little and every living thing in the grove became still as stone.

"You, Sir Caspian," said Aslan, "might have known that you could be no true King ofNarnia unless, like the Kings of old, you were a son of Adam and came from the world ofAdam's sons. And so you are. Many years ago in that world, in a deep sea of that worldwhich is called the South Sea, a shipload of pirates were driven by storm on an island.

And there they did as pirates would: killed the natives and took the native women forwives, and made palm wine, and drank and were drunk, and lay in the shade of the palmtrees, and woke up and quarrelled, and sometimes killed one another. And in one of thesefrays six were put to flight by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of theisland and up a mountain, and went, as they thought, into a cave to hide. But it was one ofthe magical places of that world, one of the chinks or chasms between chat world andthis. There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times, but they havegrown rarer. This was one of the last: I do not say the last. And so they fell, or rose, orblundered, or dropped right through, and found themselves in this world, in the Land ofTelmar which was then unpeopled. But why it was unpeopled is a long story: I will nottell it now. And in Telmar their descendants lived and became a fierce and proud people;and after many generations there was a famine in Telmar and they invaded Narnia, whichwas then in some disorder (but that also would be a long story), and conquered it andruled it. Do you mark all this well, King Caspian?"

"I do indeed, Sir," said Caspian. "I was wishing that I came of a more honourablelineage."

"You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve," said Aslan. "And that is both honourenough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to bow the shouldersof the greatest emperor on earth. Be content."

Caspian bowed.

"And now," said Aslan, "you men and women of Telmar, will you go back to that islandin the world of men from which your fathers first came? It is no bad place. The race ofthose pirates who first found it has died out, and it is without inhabitants. There are goodwells of fresh water, and fruitful soil, and timber for building, and fish in the lagoons; andthe other men of that world have not yet discovered it. The chasm is open for your return;but this I must warn you, that once you have gone through, it will close behind you forever. There will be no more commerce between the worlds by that door."

There was silence for a moment. Then a burly, decent looking fellow among theTelmarine soldiers pushed forward and said:

"Well, I'll take the offer."

"It is well chosen," said Aslan. "And because you have spoken first, strong magic is uponyou. Your future in that world shall be good. Come forth."

The man, now a little pale, came forward. Aslan and his court drew aside, leaving himfree access to the empty doorway of the stakes.

"Go through it, my son," said Aslan, bending towards him and touching the man's nosewith his own. As soon as the Lion's breath came about him, a new look came into theman's eyes - startled, but not unhappy - as if he were trying to remember something. Thenhe squared his shoulders and walked into the Door.

Everyone's eyes were fixed on him. They saw the three pieces of wood, and through themthe trees and grass and sky of Narnia. They saw the man between the doorposts: then, inone second, he had vanished utterly.

From the other end of the glade the remaining Telmarines set up a wailing. "Ugh! What'shappened to him? Do you mean to murder us? We won't go that way." And then one ofthe clever Telmarines said:

"We don't see any other world through those sticks. If you want us to believe in it, whydoesn't one of you go? All your own friends are keeping well away from the sticks."

Instantly Reepicheep stood forward and bowed. "If my example can be of any service,Aslan," he said, "I will take eleven mice through that arch at your bidding without amoment's delay."

"Nay, little one," said Aslan, laying his velvety paw ever so lightly on Reepicheep's head.

"They would do dreadful things to you in that world. They would show you at fairs. It isothers who must lead."

"Come on," said Peter suddenly to Edmund and Lucy. "Our time's up."

"What do you mean?" said Edmund.

"This way," said Susan, who seemed to know all about it. "Back into the trees. We've gotto change."

"Change what?" asked Lucy.

"Our clothes, of course," said Susan. "Nice fools we'd look on the platform of an Englishstation in these."

"But our other things are at Caspian's castle," said Edmund.

"No, they're not," said Peter, still leading the way into the thickest wood. "They're allhere. They were brought down in bundles this morning. It's all arranged."

"Was that what Aslan was talking to you and Susan about this morning?" asked Lucy.

"Yes - that and other things," said Peter, his face very solemn. "I can't tell it to you all.

There were things he wanted to say to Su and me because we're not coming back toNarnia."

"Never?" cried Edmund and Lucy in dismay.

"Oh, you two are," answered Peter. "At least, from what he said, I'm pretty sure he meansyou to get back some day. But not Su and me. He says we're getting too old."

"Oh, Peter," said Lucy. "What awful bad luck. Can you bear it?"

"Well, I think I can," said Peter. "It's all rather different from what I thought. You'llunderstand when it comes to your last time. But, quick, here are our things."

It was odd, and not very nice, to take off their royal clothes and to come back in theirschool things (not very fresh now) into that great assembly. One or two of the nastierTelmarines jeered. But the other creatures all cheered and rose up in honour of Peter theHigh King, and Queen Susan of the Horn, and King Edmund, and Queen Lucy. Therewere affectionate and (on Lucy's part) tearful farewells with all their old friends - animalkisses, and hugs from Bulgy Bears, and hands wrung by Trumpkin, and a last tickly,whiskerish embrace with Trufflehunter. And of course Caspian offered the Horn back toSusan and of course Susan told him to keep it. And then, wonderfully and terribly, it wasfarewell to Aslan himself, and Peter took his place with Susan's hands on his shouldersand Edmund's on hers and Lucy's on his and the first of the Telmarine's on Lucy's, and soin a long line they moved forward to the Door. After that came a moment which is hardto describe, for the children seemed to be seeing three things at once. One was the mouthof a cave opening into the glaring green and blue of an island in the Pacific, where all theTelmarines would find themselves the moment they were through the Door. The secondwas a glade in Narnia, the faces of Dwarfs and Beasts, the deep eyes of Aslan, and thewhite patches on the Badger's cheeks. But the third (which rapidly swallowed up the

other two) was the grey, gravelly surface of a platform in a country station, and a seatwith luggage round it, where they were all sitting as if they had never moved from it - alittle flat and dreary for a moment after all they; had been through, but also,unexpectedly, nice in its own way, what with the familiar railway smell and the Englishsky and the summer term before them.

"Well!" said Peter. "We have had a time."

"Bother!" said Edmund. "I've left my new torch in Narnia."
