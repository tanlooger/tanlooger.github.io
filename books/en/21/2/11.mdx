title: CHAPTER 11. THE LION ROARS
---

WHEN the whole party was finally awake Lucy had to tell her story for the fourth time.

The blank silence which followed it was as discouraging as anything could be.

"I can't see anything," said Peter after he had stared his eyes sore. "Can you, Susan?"

"No, of course I can't," snapped Susan. "Because there isn't anything to see. She's beendreaming. Do lie down and go to sleep, Lucy."

"And I do hope," said Lucy in a tremulous voice, "that you will all come with me.

Because - because I'll have to go with him whether anyone else does or not."

"Don't talk nonsense, Lucy," said Susan. "Of course you can't go off on your own. Don'tlet her, Peter. She's being downright naughty."

"I'll go with her, if she must go," said Edmund. "She's been right before."

"I know she has," said Peter. "And she may have been right this morning. We certainlyhad no luck going down the gorge. Still - at this hour of the night. And why should Aslanbe invisible to us? He never used to be. It's not like him. What does the D.L.F. say?"

"Oh, I say nothing at all," answered the Dwarf. "If you all go, of course, I'll go with you;and if your party splits up, I'll go with the High King. That's my duty to him and KingCaspian. But, if you ask my private opinion, I'm a plain dwarf who doesn't think there'smuch chance of finding a road by night where you couldn't find one by day. And I haveno use for magic lions which are talking lions and don't talk, and friendly lions thoughthey don't do us any good, and whopping big lions though nobody can see them. It's allbilge and beanstalks as far as I can see."

"He's beating his paw on the ground for us to hurry," said Lucy. "We must go now. Atleast I must."

"You've no right to try to force the rest of us like that. It's four to one and you're theyoungest," said Susan.

"Oh, come on," growled Edmund. "We've got to go. There'll be no peace till we do." Hefully intended to back Lucy up, but he was annoyed at losing his night's sleep and wasmaking up for it by doing everything as sulkily as possible.

"On the march, then," said Peter, wearily fitting his arm into his shield-strap and puttinghis helmet on. At any other time he would have said something nice to Lucy, who was hisfavourite sister, for he knew how wretched she must be feeling, and he knew that,

whatever had happened, it was not her fault. But he couldn't help being a little annoyedwith her all the same.

Susan was the worst. "Supposing I started behaving like Lucy," she said. "I mightthreaten to stay here whether the rest of you went on or not. I jolly well think I shall."

"Obey the High King, your Majesty," said Trumpkin, "and let's be off. If I'm not to beallowed to sleep, I'd as soon march as stand here talking."

And so at last they got on the move. Lucy went first, biting her lip and trying not to sayall the things she thought of saying to Susan. But she forgot them when she fixed her eyeson Aslan. He turned and walked at a slow pace about thirty yards ahead of them. Theothers had only Lucy's directions to guide them, for Aslan was not only invisible to thembut silent as well. His big cat-like paws made no noise on the grass.

He led them to the right of the dancing trees - whether they were still dancing nobodyknew, for Lucy had her eyes on the Lion and the rest had their eyes on Lucy - and nearerthe edge of the gorge. "Cobbles and kettledrums!" thought Trumpkin. "I hope thismadness isn't going to end in a moonlight climb and broken necks."

For a long way Aslan went along the top of the precipices. Then they came to a placewhere some little trees grew right on the edge. He turned and disappeared among them.

Lucy held her breath, for it looked as if he had plunged over the cliff; but she was toobusy keeping him in sight to stop and think about this. She quickened her pace and wassoon among the trees herself. Looking down, she could see a steep and narrow path goingslantwise down into the gorge between rocks, and Aslan descending it. He turned andlooked at her with his happy eyes. Lucy clapped her hands and began to scramble downafter him. From behind her she heard the voices of the others shouting, "Hi! Lucy! Lookout, for goodness' sake. You're right on the edge of the gorge. Come back - "and then, amoment later, Edmund's voice saying, "No, she's right. There is a way down."

Half-way down the path Edmund caught up with her.

"Look!" he said in great excitement. "Look! What's that shadow crawling down in frontof us?"

"It's his shadow," said Lucy.

"I do believe you're right, Lu," said Edmund. "I can't think how I didn't see it before. Butwhere is he?"

"With his shadow, of course. Can't you see him?"

"Well, I almost thought I did - for a moment. It's such a rum light."

"Get on, King Edmund, get on," came Trumpkin's voice from behind and above: andthen, farther behind and still nearly at the top, Peter's voice saying, "Oh, buck up, Susan.

Give me your hand. Why, a baby could get down here. And do stop grousing."

In a few minutes they were at the bottom and the roaring of water filled their ears.

Treading delicately, like a cat, Aslan stepped from stone to stone across the stream. In themiddle he stopped, bent down to drink, and as he raised his shaggy head, dripping fromthe water, he turned to face them again. This time Edmund saw him. "Oh, Aslan!" hecried, darting forward. But the Lion whisked round and began padding up the slope onthe far side of the Rush.

"Peter, Peter," cried Edmund. "Did you see?"

"I saw something," said Peter. "But it's so tricky in this moonlight. On we go, though, andthree cheers for Lucy. I don't feel half so tired now, either."

Aslan without hesitation led them to their left, farther up the gorge. The whole journeywas odd and dream-like the roaring stream, the wet grey grass, the glimmering cliffswhich they were approaching, and always the glorious, silently pacing Beast ahead.

Everyone except Susan and the Dwarf could see him now.

Presently they came to another steep path, up the face of the farther precipices. Thesewere far higher than the ones they had just descended, and the journey up them was along and tedious zig-zag. Fortunately the Moon shone right above the gorge so thatneither side was in shadow.

Lucy was nearly blown when the tail and hind legs of Aslan disappeared over the top: butwith one last effort she scrambled after him and came out, rather shaky-legged andbreathless, on the hill they had been trying to reach ever since they left Glasswater. Thelong gentle slope (heather and grass and a few very big rocks that shone white in themoonlight) stretched up to where it vanished in a glimmer of trees about half a mileaway. She knew it. It was the hill of the Stone Table:

With a jingling of mail the others climbed up behind her. Aslan glided on before themand they walked after him.

"Lucy," said Susan in a very small voice.

"Yes?" said Lucy.

"I see him now. I'm sorry."

"That's all right."

"But I've been far worse than you know. I really believed it was him - he, I mean -

yesterday. When he warned us not to go down to the fir wood. And I really believed it

was him tonight, when you woke us up. I mean, deep down inside. Or I could have, if I'dlet myself. But I just wanted to get out of the woods and - and - oh, I don't know. Andwhat ever am I to say to him?"

"Perhaps you won't need to say much," suggested Lucy.

Soon they reached the trees and through them the children could see the Great Mound,Aslan's How, which had been raised over the Table since their days.

"Our side don't keep very good watch," muttered Trumpkin. "We ought to have beenchallenged before now -"

"Hush!" said the other four, for now Aslan had stopped and turned and stood facing them,looking so majestic that they felt as glad as anyone can who feels afraid, and as afraid asanyone can who feels glad. The boys strode forward: Lucy made way for them: Susanand the Dwarf shrank back.

"Oh, Aslan," said King Peter, dropping on one knee and raising the Lion's heavy paw tohis face, "I'm so glad. And I'm so sorry. I've been leading them wrong ever since westarted and especially yesterday morning."

"My dear son," said Aslan.

Then he turned and welcomed Edmund. "Well done," were his words.

Then, after an awful pause, the deep voice said, "Susan." Susan made no answer but theothers thought she was crying. "You have listened to fears, child," said Aslan. "Come, letme breathe on you. Forget them. Are you brave again?"

"A little, Aslan," said Susan.

"And now!" said Aslan in a much louder voice with just a hint of roar in it, while his taillashed his flanks. "And now, where is this little Dwarf, this famous swordsman andarcher, who doesn't believe in lions? Come here, son of Earth, come HERE!" - and thelast word was no longer the hint of a roar but almost the real thing.

"Wraiths and wreckage!" gasped Trumpkin in the ghost of a voice. The children, whoknew Aslan well enough to see that he liked the Dwarf very much, were not disturbed;but it was quite another thing for Trumpkin, who had never seen a lion before, let alonethis Lion. He did the only sensible thing he could have done; that is, instead of bolting, hetottered towards Aslan.

Aslan pounced. Have you ever seen a very young kitten being carried in the mother cat'smouth? It was like that. The Dwarf, hunched up in a little, miserable ball, hung fromAslan's mouth. The Lion gave him one shake and all his armour rattled like a tinker'spack and then - heypresto - the Dwarf flew up in the air. He was as safe as if he had been

in bed, though he did not feel so. As he came down the huge velvety paws caught him asgently as a mother's arms and set him (right way up, too) on the ground.

"Son of Earth, shall we be friends?" asked Aslan.

"Ye - he - he - hes," panted the Dwarf, for it had not yet got its breath back.

"Now," said Aslan. "The Moon is setting. Look behind you: there is the dawn beginning.

We have no time to lose. You three, you sons of Adam and son of Earth, hasten into theMound and deal with what you will find there."

The Dwarf was still speechless and neither of the boys dared to ask if Aslan would followthem. All three drew their swords and saluted, then turned and jingled away into the dusk.

Lucy noticed that there was no sign of weariness in their faces: both the High King andKing Edmund looked more like men than boys.

The girls watched them out of sight, standing close beside Aslan. The light was changing.

Low down in the east, Aravir, the morning star of Narnia, gleamed like a little moon.

Aslan, who seemed larger than before, lifted his head, shook his mane, and roared.

The sound, deep and throbbing at first like an organ beginning on a low note, rose andbecame louder, and then far louder again, till the earth and air were shaking with it. Itrose up from that hill and floated across all Narnia. Down in Miraz's camp men woke,stared palely in one another's faces, and grasped their weapons. Down below that in theGreat River, now at its coldest hour, the heads and shoulders of the nymphs, and the greatweedy-bearded head of the river-god, rose from the water. Beyond it, in every field andwood, the alert ears of rabbits rose from their holes, the sleepy heads of birds came outfrom under wings, owls hooted, vixens barked, hedgehogs grunted, the trees stirred. Intowns and villages mothers pressed babies close to their breasts, staring with wild eyes,dogs whimpered, and men leaped up groping for lights. Far away on the northern frontierthe mountain giants peered from the dark gateways of their castles.

What Lucy and Susan saw was a dark something coming to them from almost everydirection across the hills. It looked first like a black mist creeping on the ground, then likethe stormy waves of a black sea rising higher and higher as it came on, and then, at last,like what it was woods on the move. All the trees of the world appeared to be rushingtowards Aslan. But as they drew nearer they looked less like trees; and when the wholecrowd, bowing and curtsying and waving thin long arms to Aslan, were all around Lucy,she saw that it was a crowd of human shapes. Pale birch-girls were tossing their heads,willowwomen pushed back their hair from their brooding faces to gaze on Aslan, thequeenly beeches stood still and adored him, shaggy oak-men, lean and melancholy elms,shockheaded hollies (dark themselves, but their wives all bright with berries) and gayrowans, all bowed and rose again, shouting, "Aslan, Aslan!" in their various husky orcreaking or wave-like voices.

The crowd and the dance round Aslan (for it had become a dance once more) grew sothick and rapid that Lucy was confused. She never saw where certain other people camefrom who were soon capering about among the trees. One was a youth, dressed only in afawn-skin, with vine-leaves wreathed in his curly hair. His face would have been almosttoo pretty for a boy's, if it had not looked, so extremely wild. You felt, as Edmund saidwhen he saw him a few days later, "There's a chap who might do anything absolutelyanything." He seemed to have a great many names - Bromios, Bassareus, and the Ramwere three of them. There were a lot of girls with him, as wild as he. There was even,unexpectedly, someone on a donkey. And everybody was laughing: and everybody wasshouting out, "Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi."

"Is it a Romp, Aslan?" cried the youth. And apparently it was. But nearly everyoneseemed to have a different idea as to what they were playing. It may have been Tig, butLucy never discovered who was It. It was rather like Blind Man's Buff, only everyonebehaved as if they were blindfolded. It was not unlike Hunt the Slipper, but the slipperwas never found. What made it more complicated was that the man on the donkey, whowas old and enormously fat, began calling out at once, "Refreshments! Time forrefreshments," and falling off his donkey and being bundled on to it again by the others,while the donkey was under the impression that the whole thing was a circus and tried togive a display of walking on its hind legs. And all the time there were more and morevine leaves everywhere. And soon not only leaves but vines. They were climbing upeverything. They were running up the legs of the tree people and circling round theirnecks. Lucy put up her hands to push back her hair and found she was pushing back vinebranches. The donkey was a mass of them. His tail was completely entangled andsomething dark was nodding between his ears. Lucy looked again and saw it was a bunchof grapes. After that it was mostly grapes overhead and underfoot and all around.

"Refreshments! Refreshments," roared the old man.

Everyone began eating, and whatever hothouses your people may have, you have nevertasted such grapes. Really good grapes, firm and tight on the outside, but bursting intocool sweetness when you put them into your mouth, were one of the things the girls hadnever had quite enough of before. Here, there were more than anyone could possiblywant, and rib table-manners at all. One saw sticky and stained fingers everywhere, and,though mouths were full, the laughter never ceased nor the yodelling cries of Euan, euan,eu-oi-oi-oi-oi, till all of a sudden everyone felt at the same moment that the game(whatever it was), and the feast, ought to be over, and everyone flopped down breathlesson the ground and turned their faces to Aslan to hear what he would say next.

At that moment the sun was just rising and Lucy remembered something and whisperedto Susan,

"I say, Su, I know who they are."

"Who?"

"The boy with the wild face is Bacchus and the old one on the donkey is Silenus. Don'tyou remember Mr Tumnus telling us about them long ago?"

"Yes, of course. But I say, Lu "

"What?"

"I wouldn't have felt safe with Bacchus and all his wild girls if we'd met them withoutAslan."

"I should think not," said Lucy.
