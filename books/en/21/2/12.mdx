title: CHAPTER 12. SORCERY AND SUDDEN VENGEANCE
---

MEANWHILE Trumpkin and the two boys arrived at the dark little stone archway whichled into the inside of the Mound, and two sentinel badgers (the white patches on theircheeks were all Edmund could see of them) leaped up with bared teeth and asked them insnarling voices, "Who goes there?"

"Trumpkin," said the Dwarf. "Bringing the High King of Narnia out of the far past."

The badgers nosed at the boys' hands. "At last," they said. "At last."

"Give us a light, friends," said Trumpkin.

The badgers found a torch just inside the arch and Peter lit it and handed it to Trumpkin.

"The D.L.F. had better lead," he said. "We don't know our way about this place."

Trumpkin took the torch and went ahead into the dark tunnel. It was a cold, black, mustyplace, with an occasional bat fluttering in the torchlight, and plenty of cobwebs. Theboys, who had been mostly in the open air since that morning at the railway station, feltas if they were going into a trap or a prison.

"I say, Peter," whispered Edmund. "Look at those carvings on the walls. Don't they lookold? And yet we're older than that. When we were last here, they hadn't been made."

"Yes," said Peter. "That makes one think."

The Dwarf went on ahead and then turned to the right, and then to the left, and then downsome steps, and then to the left again. Then at last they saw a light ahead - light fromunder a door. And now for the first time they heard voices, for they had come to the door

of the central chamber. The voices inside were angry ones. Someone was talking soloudly that the approach of the boys and the Dwarf had not been heard.

"Don't like the sound of that," whispered Trumpkin to Peter. "Let's listen for a moment."All three stood perfectly still on the outside of the door.

"You know well enough," said a voice ("That's the King," whispered Trumpkin), "whythe Horn was not blown at sunrise this morning. Have you forgotten that Miraz fell uponus almost before Trumpkin had gone, and we were fighting for our lives for the space ofthree hours and more? I blew it when first I had a breathing space."

"I'm not likely to forget it," came the angry voice, "when my Dwarfs bore the brunt of theattack and one in five of them fell." ("That's Nikabrik," whispered Trumpkin.)

"For shame, Dwarf," came a thick voice ("Trufflehunter's," said Trumpkin). "We all didas much as the Dwarfs and none more than the King."

"Tell that tale your own way for all I care," answered Nikabrik. "But whether it was thatthe Horn was blown too late, or whether there was no magic in it, no help has come. You,you great clerk, you master magician, you know-all; are you still asking us to hang ourhopes on Aslan and King Peter and all the rest of it?"

"I must confess - I cannot deny it - that I am deeply disappointed in the result of theoperation," came the answer. ("That'll be Doctor Cornelius," said Trumpkin.)

"To speak plainly," said Nikabrik, "your wallet's empty, your eggs addled, your fishuncaught, your promises broken. Stand aside then and let others work. And that is why -"

"The help will come," said Trufflehunter. "I stand by Aslan. Have patience, like usbeasts. The help will come. It may be even now at the door."

"Pah!" snarled Nikabrik. "You badgers would have us wait till the sky falls and we canall catch larks. I tell you we can't wait. Food is running short; we lose more than we canafford at every encounter; our followers are slipping away."

"And why?" asked Trufflehunter. "I'll tell you why. Because it is noised among them thatwe have called on the Kings of old and the Kings of old have not answered. The lastwords Trumpkin spoke before he went (and went, most likely, to his death) were, `If youmust blow the Horn, do not let the army know why you blow it or what you hope from it.'But that same evening everyone seemed to know."

"You'd better have shoved your grey snout in a hornets' nest, Badger, than suggest that Iam the blab," said Nikabrik. "Take it back, or-"

"Oh, stop it, both of you," said King Caspian. "I want to know what it is that Nikabrikkeeps on hinting we should do. But before that, I want to know who those two strangers

are whom he has brought into our council and who stand there with their ears open andtheir mouths shut."

"They are friends of mine," said Nikabrik. "And what better right have you yourself to behere than that you are a friend of Trumpkin's and the Badger's? And what right has thatold dotard in the black gown to be here except that he is your friend? Why am I to be theonly one who can't bring in his friends?"

"His Majesty is the King to whom you have sworn allegiance," said Trufflehunter sternly.

"Court manners, court manners," sneered Nikabrik. "But in this hole we may talk plainly.

You know - and he knows that this Telmarine boy will be king of nowhere and nobody ina week unless we can help him out of the trap in which he sits."

"Perhaps," said Cornelius, "your new friends would like to speak for themselves? Youthere, who and what are you?"

"Worshipful Master Doctor," came a thin, whining voice. "So please you, I'm only a poorold woman, I am, and very obliged to his Worshipful Dwarfship for his friendship, I'msure. His Majesty, bless his handsome face, has no need to be afraid of an old womanthat's nearly doubled up with the rheumatics and hasn't two sticks to put under her kettle.

I have some poor little skill - not like yours, Master Doctor, of course - in small spellsand cantrips that I'd be glad to use against our enemies if it was agreeable to allconcerned. For I hate 'em. Oh yes. No one hates better than me."

"That is all most interesting and - er - satisfactory," said Doctor Cornelius. "I think I nowknow what you are, Madam. Perhaps your other friend, Nikabrik, would give someaccount of himself?"

A dull, grey voice at which Peter's flesh crept replied, "I'm hunger. I'm thirst. Where Ibite, I hold till I die, and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from myenemy's body and bury it with me. I can fast a hundred years and not die. I can lie ahundred nights on the ice and not freeze. I can drink a river of blood and not burst. Showme your enemies."

"And it is in the presence of these two that you wish to disclose your plan?" said Caspian.

"Yes," said Nikabrik. "And by their help that I mean to execute it."

There was a minute or two during which Trumpkin and the boys could hear Caspian andhis two friends speaking in low voices but could not make out what they were saying.

Then Caspian spoke aloud.

"Well, Nikabrik," he said, "we will hear your plan."

There was a pause so long that the boys began to wonder if Nikabrik was ever going tobegin; when he did, it was in a lower voice, as if he himself did not much like what hewas saying.

"All said and done," he muttered, "none of us knows the truth about the ancient days inNarnia. Trumpkin believed none of the stories. I was ready to put them to the trial. Wetried first the Horn and it has failed. If there ever was a High King Peter and a QueenSusan and a King Edmund and a Queen Lucy, then either they have not heard us, or theycannot come, or they are our enemies -"

"Or they are on the way," put in Trufflehunter.

"You can go on saying that till Miraz has fed us all to his dogs. As I was saying, we havetried one link in the chain of old legends, and it has done us no good. Well. But whenyour sword breaks, you draw your dagger. The stories tell of other powers beside theancient Kings and Queens. How if we could call them up?"

"If you mean Aslan," said Trufflehunter, "it's all one calling on him and on the Kings.

They were his servants. If he will not send them (but I make no doubt he will), is he morelikely to come himself?"

"No. You're right there," said Nikabrik. "Aslan and the Kings go together. Either Aslan isdead, or he is not on our side. Or else something stronger than himself keeps him back.

And if he did come - how do we know he'd be our friend? He was not always a goodfriend to Dwarfs by all that's told. Not even to all beasts. Ask the Wolves. And anyway,he was in Narnia only once that I ever heard of, and he didn't stay long. You may dropAslan out of the reckoning. I was thinking of someone else."

There was no answer, and for a few minutes it was so still that Edmund could hear thewheezy and snuffling breath of the Badger.

"Who do you mean?" said Caspian at last.

"I mean a power so much greater than Aslan's that it held Narnia spellbound for years andyears, if the stories are true."

"The White Witch!" cried three voices all at once, and from the noise Peter guessed thatthree people had leaped to their feet.

"Yes," said Nikabrik very slowly and distinctly, "I mean the Witch. Sit down again. Don'tall take fright at a name as if you were children. We want power: and we want a powerthat will be on our side. As for power, do not the stories say that the Witch defeatedAslan, and bound him, and killed him on that very stone which is over there, just beyondthe light?"

"But they also say that he came to life again," said the Badger sharply.

"Yes, they say," answered Nikabrik, "but you'll notice that we hear precious little aboutanything he did afterwards. He just fades out of the story. How do you explain that, if hereally came to life? Isn't it much more likely that he didn't, and that the stories saynothing more about him because there was nothing more to say?"

"He established the Kings and Queens," said Caspian.

"A King who has just won a great battle can usually establish himself without the help ofa performing lion," said Nikabrik. There was a fierce growl, probably from Trufflehunter.

"And anyway," Nikabrik continued, "what came of the Kings and their reign? They fadedtoo. But it's very different with the Witch. They say she ruled for a hundred years: ahundred years of winter. There's power, if you like. There's something practical."

"But, heaven and earth!" said the King, "haven't we always been told that she was theworst enemy of all? Wasn't she a tyrant ten times worse than Miraz?"

"Perhaps," said Nikabrik in a cold voice. "Perhaps she was for you humans, if there wereany of you in those days. Perhaps she was for some of the beasts. She stamped out theBeavers, I dare say; at least there are none of them in Narnia now. But she got on all rightwith us Dwarfs. I'm a Dwarf and I stand by my own people. We're not afraid of theWitch."

"But you've joined with us," said Trufflehunter.

"Yes, and a lot of good it has done my people, so far," snapped Nikabrik. "Who is sent onall the dangerous !, raids? The Dwarfs. Who goes short when the rations fail? TheDwarfs. Who -?"

"Lies! All lies!" said the Badger.

"And so," said Nikabrik, whose voice now rose to a scream, "if you can't help my people,I'll go to someone who can."

"Is this open treason, Dwarf?" asked the King.

"Put that sword back in its sheath, Caspian," said Nikabrik. "Murder at council, eh? Isthat your game? Don't be fool enough to try it. Do you think I'm afraid of you? There'sthree on my side, and three on yours."

"Come on, then," snarled Trufflehunter, but he was immediately interrupted.

"Stop, stop, stop," said Doctor Cornelius. "You go on too fast. The Witch is dead. All thestories agree on that. What does Nikabrik mean by calling on the Witch?"

That grey and terrible voice which had spoken only once before said, "Oh, is she?"

And then the shrill, whining voice began, "Oh, bless his heart, his dear little Majestyneedn't mind about the White Lady - that's what we call her - being dead. The WorshipfulMaster Doctor is only making game of a poor old woman like me when he says that.

Sweet Mastery Doctor, learned Master Doctor, who ever heard of a witch that reallydied? You can always get them back."

"Call her up," said the grey voice. "We are all ready. Draw the circle. Prepare the bluefire."

Above the steadily increasing growl of the Badger and Cornelius's sharp "What?" rosethe voice of King Caspian like thunder.

"So that is your plan, Nikabrik! Black sorcery and the calling up of an accursed ghost.

And I see who your companions are-a Hag and a Werewolf!"

The next minute or so was very confused. There was an animal roaring, a clash of steel;the boys and Trumpkin rushed in; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible, grey, gaunt creature,half man and half wolf, in the very act of leaping upon a boy about his own age, andEdmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of cat fight. Trumpkinfound himself face to face with the Hag. Her nose and chin stuck out like a pair of nut-

crackers, her dirty grey hair was flying about her face and she had just got DoctorCornelius by the throat. At one slash of Trumpkin's sword her head rolled on the floor.

Then the light was knocked over and it was all swords, teeth, claws, fists, and boots forabout sixty seconds. Then silence.

"Are you all right, Ed?"

"I - I think so," panted Edmund. "I've got that brute Nikabrik, but he's still alive."

"Weights and water-bottles!" came an angry voice. "It's me you're sitting on. Get off.

You're like a young elephant."

"Sorry, D.L.F.," said Edmund. "Is that better?"

"Ow! No!" bellowed Trumpkin. "You're putting your ' boot in my mouth. Go away." `

"Is King Caspian anywhere?" asked Peter.

"I'm here," said a rather faint voice. "Something bit me."

They all heard the noise of someone striking a match. It was Edmund. The little flameshowed his face, looking pale and dirty. He blundered about for a little, found the candle(they were no longer using the lamp, for they had run out of oil), set it on the table, and lit

it. When the flame rose clear, several people scrambled to their feet. Six faces blinked atone another in the candlelight.

"We don't seem to have any enemies left," said Peter. "There's the Hag, dead." (He turnedhis eyes quickly away from her.) "And Nikabrik, dead too. And I suppose this thing is aWerewolf. It's so long since I've seen one. Wolf's head and man's body. That means hewas just turning from man into wolf at the moment he was killed. And you, I suppose, areKing Caspian?"

"Yes," said the other boy. "But I've no idea who you are."

"It's the High King, King Peter," said Trumpkin.

"Your Majesty is very welcome," said Caspian.

"And so is your Majesty," said Peter. "I haven't come to take your place, you know, but toput you into it." ,

"Your Majesty," said another voice at Peter's elbow. He turned and found himself face toface with the Badger.

Peter leaned forward, put his arms round the beast and kissed the furry head: it wasn't agirlish thing for him to do, because he was the High King.

"Best of badgers," he said. "You never doubted us all through."

"No credit to me, your Majesty," said Trufflehunter. "1'm a beast and we don't change.

I'm a badger, what's more, and we hold on."

"I am sorry for Nikabrik," said Caspian, "though he hated me from the first moment hesaw me. He had gone sour inside from long suffering and hating. If we had won quicklyhe might have become a good Dwarf in the days of peace. I don't know which of us killedhim. I'm glad of that."

"You're bleeding," said Peter.

"Yes, I'm bitten," said Caspian. "It was that - that wolf thing." Cleaning and bandagingthe wound took a long time, and when it was done Trumpkin said, "Now. Beforeeverything else we want some breakfast."

"But not here," said Peter.

"No," said Caspian with a shudder. "And we must send someone to take away thebodies."

"Let the vermin be flung into a pit," said Peter. "But the Dwarf we will give to his peopleto be buried in their own fashion."

They breakfasted at last in another of the dark cellars of Aslan's How. It was not such abreakfast as they would have chosen, for Caspian and Cornelius were thinking of venisonpasties, and Peter and Edmund of buttered eggs and hot coffee, but what everyone gotwas a little bit of cold bear-meat (out of the boys' pockets), a lump of hard cheese, anonion, and a mug of water. But, from the way they fell to, anyone would have supposed itwas delicious.
