title: CHAPTER 2. THE ANCIENT TREASURE HOUSE
---

"THIS wasn't a garden," said Susan presently. "It was a castle and this must have beenthe courtyard."

"I see what you mean," said Peter. "Yes. That is the remains of a tower. And there is whatused to be a flight of steps going up to the top of the walls. And look at those other steps -

the broad, shallow ones - going up to that doorway. It must have been the door into thegreat hall."

"Ages ago, by the look of it," said Edmund.

"Yes, ages ago," said Peter. "I wish we could find out who the people were that lived inthis castle; and how long ago."

"It gives me a queer feeling," said Lucy.

"Does it, Lu?" said Peter, turning and looking hard at her. "Because it does the same tome. It is the queerest thing that has happened this queer day. I wonder where we are andwhat it all means?"

While they were talking they had crossed the courtyard and gone through the otherdoorway into what had once been the hall. This was now very like the courtyard, for theroof had long since disappeared and it was merely another space of grass and daisies,except that it was shorter and narrower and the walls were higher. Across the far endthere was a kind of terrace about three feet higher than the rest.

"I wonder, was it really the hall?" said Susan. "What is that terrace kind of thing?"

"Why, you silly," said Peter (who had become strangely excited), "don't you see? Thatwas the dais where the High Table was, where the King and the great lords sat. Anyonewould think you had forgotten that we ourselves were once Kings and Queens and sat ona dais just like that, in our great hall."

"In our castle of Cair Paravel," continued Susan in a dreamy and rather sing-song voice,"at the mouth of the great river of Narnia. How could I forget?"

"How it all comes back!" said Lucy. "We could pretend we were in Cair Paravel now.

This hall must have been very like the great hall we feasted in."

"But unfortunately without the feast," said Edmund. "It's getting late, you know. Lookhow long the shadows are. And have you noticed that it isn't so hot?"

"We shall need a camp-fire if we've got to spend the night here," said Peter. "I've gotmatches. Let's go and see if we can collect some dry wood."

Everyone saw the sense of this, and for the next halfhour they were busy. The orchardthrough which they had first come into the ruins turned out not to be a good place forfirewood. They tried the other side of the castle, passing out of the hall by a little sidedoor into a maze of stony humps and hollows which must once have been passages andsmaller rooms but was now all nettles and wild roses. Beyond this they found a wide gapin the castle wall and stepped through it into a wood of darker and bigger trees wherethey found dead branches and rotten wood and sticks and dry leaves and fir-cones inplenty. They went to and fro with bundles until they had a good pile on the dais. At thefifth journey they found the well, just outside the hall, hidden in weeds, but clean andfresh and deep when they had cleared these away.

The remains of a stone pavement ran half-way round it. Then the girls went out to picksome more apples and the boys built the fire, on the dais and fairly close to the cornerbetween two walls, which they thought would be the snuggest and warmest place. Theyhad great difficulty in lighting it and used a lot of matches, but they succeeded in the end.

Finally, all four sat down with their backs to the wall and their faces to the fire. Theytried roasting some of the apples on the ends of sticks. But roast apples are not muchgood without sugar, and they are too hot to eat with your fingers till they are too cold tobe worth eating. So they had to content themselves with raw apples, which, as Edmundsaid, made one realize that school suppers weren't so bad after all - "I shouldn't mind agood thick slice of bread and margarine this minute," he added. But the spirit ofadventure was rising in them all, and no one really wanted to be back at school.

Shortly after the last apple had been eaten, Susan went out to the well to get anotherdrink. When she came back she was carrying something in her hand.

"Look," she said in a rather choking kind of voice. "I found it by the well." She handed itto Peter and sat down. The others thought she looked and sounded as if she might begoing to cry. Edmund and Lucy eagerly bent forward to see what was in Peter's hand - alittle, bright thing that gleamed in the firelight.

"Well, I'm - I'm jiggered," said Peter, and his voice also sounded queer. Then he handed itto the others.

All now saw what it was - a little chess-knight, ordinary in size but extraordinarily heavybecause it was made of pure gold; and the eyes in the horse's head were two tiny littlerubies or rather one was, for the other had been knocked out.

"Why!" said Lucy, "it's exactly like one of the golden chessmen we used to play withwhen we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel."

"Cheer up, Su," said Peter to his other sister.

"I can't help it," said Susan. "It brought back - oh, such lovely times. And I rememberedplaying chess with fauns and good giants, and the mer-people singing in the sea, and mybeautiful horse - and - and -"

"Now," said Peter in a quite different voice, "it's about time we four started using ourbrains."

"What about?" asked Edmund.

"Have none of you guessed where we are?" said Peter.

"Go on, go on," said Lucy. "I've felt for hours that there was some wonderful mysteryhanging over this place."

"Fire ahead, Peter," said Edmund. "We're all listening."

"We are in the ruins of Cair Paravel itself," said Peter.

"But, I say," replied Edmund. "I mean, how do you make that out? This place has beenruined for ages. Look at all those big trees growing right up to the gates. Look at the verystones. Anyone can see that nobody has lived here for hundreds of years."

"I know," said Peter. "That is the difficulty. But let's leave that out for the moment. I wantto take the points one by one. First point: this hall is exactly the same shape and size asthe hall at Cair Paravel. Just picture a roof on this, and a coloured pavement instead ofgrass, and tapestries on the walls, and you get our royal banqueting hall."

No one said anything.

"Second point," continued Peter. "The castle well is exactly where our well was, a little tothe south of the great hall; and it is exactly the same size and shape."

Again there was no reply.

"Third point: Susan has just found one of our old chessmen - or something as like one ofthem as two peas."

Still nobody answered.

"Fourth point. Don't you remember - it was the very day before the ambassadors camefrom the King of Calormen don't you remember planting the orchard outside the northgate of Cair Paravel? The greatest of all the wood-people, Pomona herself, came to putgood spells on it. It was those very decent little chaps the moles who did the actualdigging. Can you have forgotten that funny old Lilygloves, the chief mole, leaning on hisspade and saying, `Believe me, your Majesty, you'll be glad of these fruit trees one day.'And by Jove he was right."

"I do! I do!" said Lucy, and clapped her hands.

"But look here, Peter," said Edmund. "This must be all rot. To begin with, we didn't plantthe orchard slap up against the gate. We wouldn't have been such fools."

"No, of course not," said Peter. "But it has grown up to the gate since."

"And for another thing," said Edmund, "Cair Paravel wasn't on an island."

"Yes, I've been wondering about that. But it was a what-do-you-call-it, a peninsula. Jollynearly an island. Couldn't it have been made an island since our time? Somebody has duga channel."

"But half a moment!" said Edmund. "You keep on saying since our time. But it's only ayear ago since we came back from Narnia. And you want to make out that in one yearcastles have fallen down, and great forests have grown up, and little trees we saw plantedourselves have turned into a big old orchard, and goodness knows what else. It's allimpossible."

"There's one thing," said Lucy. "If this is Cair Paravel there ought to be a door at this endof the dais. In fact we ought to be sitting with our backs against it at this moment. Youknow - the door that led down to the treasure chamber."

"I suppose there isn't a door," said Peter, getting up.

The wall behind them was a mass of ivy.

"We can soon find out," said Edmund, taking up one of the sticks that they had laid readyfor putting on the fire. He began beating the ivied wall. Tap-tap went the stick against thestone; and again, tap-tap; and then, all at once, boomboom, with a quite different sound, ahollow, wooden sound.

"Great Scott!" said Edmund.

"We must clear this ivy away," said Peter.

"Oh, do let's leave it alone," said Susan. "We can try it in the morning. If we've got tospend the night here I don't want an open door at my back and a great big black hole thatanything might come out of, besides the draught and the damp. And it'll soon be dark."

"Susan! How can you?" said Lucy with a reproachful glance. But both the boys were toomuch excited to take any notice of Susan's advice. They worked at the ivy with theirhands and with Peter's pocket-knife till the knife broke. After that they used Edmund's.

Soon the whole place where they had been sitting was covered with ivy; and at last theyhad the door cleared.

"Locked, of course," said Peter.

"But the wood's all rotten," said Edmund. "We can pull it to bits in no time, and it willmake extra firewood. Come on."

It took them longer than they expected and, before they had done, the great hall hadgrown dusky and the first star or two had come out overhead. Susan was not the only onewho felt a slight shudder as the boys stood above the pile of splintered wood, rubbing thedirt off their hands and staring into the cold, dark opening they had made.

"Now for a torch," said Peter.

"Oh, what is the good?" said Susan. "And as Edmund said -"

"I'm not saying it now," Edmund interrupted. "I still don't understand, but we can settlethat later. I suppose you're coming down, Peter?"

"We must," said Peter. "Cheer up, Susan. It's no good behaving like kids now that we areback in Narnia.

You're a Queen here. And anyway no one could go to sleep with a mystery like this ontheir minds."

They tried to use long sticks as torches but this was not a success. If you held them withthe lighted end up they went out, and if you held them the other way they scorched yourhand and the smoke got in your eyes. In the end they had to use Edmund's electric torch;luckily it had been a birthday present less than a week ago and the battery was almostnew. He went first, with the light. Then came Lucy, then Susan, and Peter brought up therear.

"I've come to the top of the steps," said Edmund.

"Count them," said Peter.

"One - two - three," said Edmund, as he went cautiously down, and so up to sixteen.

"And this is the bottom," he shouted back.

"Then it really must be Cair Paravel," said Lucy. "There were sixteen." Nothing morewas said till all four were standing in a knot together at the foot of the stairway. ThenEdmund flashed his torch slowly round.

"O - o - o - oh!!" said all the children at once.

For now all knew that it was indeed the ancient treasure chamber of Cair Paravel wherethey had once reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. There was a kind of path up themiddle (as it might be in a greenhouse), and along each side at intervals stood rich suitsof armour, like knights guarding the treasures. In between the suits of armour, and oneach side of the path, were shelves covered with precious things - necklaces and armrings and finger rings and golden bowls and dishes and long tusks of ivory, brooches andcoronets and chains of gold, and heaps of unset stones lying piled anyhow as if they weremarbles or potatoes - diamonds, rubies, carbuncles, emeralds, topazes, and amethysts.

Under the shelves stood great chests of oak strengthened with iron bars and heavilypadlocked. And it was bitterly cold, and so still that they could hear themselvesbreathing, and the treasures were so covered with dust that unless they had realized wherethey were and remembered most of the things, they would hardly have known they weretreasures. There was something sad and a little frightening about the place, because it allseemed so forsaken and long ago. That was why nobody said anything for at least aminute.

Then, of course, they began walking about and picking things up to look at. It was likemeeting very old friends. If you had been there you would have heard them saying thingslike, "Oh look! Our coronation rings - do you remember first wearing this? - Why, this isthe little brooch we all thought was lost - I say, isn't that the armour you wore in the greattournament in the Lone Islands? - do you remember the dwarf making that for me? - doyou remember drinking out of that horn? - do you remember, do you remember?"

But suddenly Edmund said, "Look here. We mustn't waste the battery: goodness knowshow often we shall need it. Hadn't we better take what we want and get out again?"

"We must take the gifts," said Peter. For long ago at a Christmas in Narnia he and Susanand Lucy had been given certain presents which they valued more than their wholekingdom. Edmund had had no gift, because he was not with them at the time. (This washis own fault, and you can read about it in the other book.)

They all agreed with Peter and walked up the path to the wall at the far end of thetreasure chamber, and there, sure enough, the gifts were still hanging. Lucy's was thesmallest for it was only a little bottle. But the bottle was made of diamond instead ofglass, and it was still more than half full of the magical cordial which would heal almostevery wound and every illness. Lucy said nothing and looked very solemn as she took hergift down from its place and slung the belt over her shoulder and once more felt the bottleat her side where it used to hang in the old days. Susan's gift had been a bow and arrows

and a horn. The bow was still there, and the ivory quiver, full of wellfeathered arrows,but - "Oh, Susan," said Lucy. "Where's the horn?"

"Oh bother, bother, bother," said Susan after she had thought for a moment. "I remembernow. I took it with me the last day of all, the day we went hunting the White Stag. It musthave got lost when we blundered back into that other place - England, I mean."

Edmund whistled. It was indeed a shattering loss; for this was an enchanted horn and,whenever you blew it, help was certain to come to you, wherever you were.

"Just the sort of thing that might come in handy in a place like this," said Edmund.

"Never mind," said Susan, "I've still got the bow." And she took it.

"Won't the string be perished, Su?" said Peter.

But whether by some magic in the air of the treasure chamber or not, the bow was still inworking order. Archery and swimming were the things Susan was good at. In a momentshe had bent the bow and then she gave one little pluck to the string. It twanged: achirruping twang that vibrated through the whole room. And that one small noise broughtback the old days to the children's minds more than anything that had happened yet. Allthe battles and hunts and feasts came rushing into their heads together.

Then she unstrung the bow again and slung the quiver at her side.

Next, Peter took down his gift - the shield with the great red lion on it, and the royalsword. He blew, and rapped them on the floor, to get off the dust. He fitted the shield onhis arm and slung the sword by his side. He was afraid at first that it might be rusty andstick to the sheath. But it was not so. With one swift motion he drew it and held it up,shining in the torchlight.

"It is my sword Rhindon," he said; "with it I killed the Wolf." There was a new tone inhis voice, and the others all felt that he was really Peter the High King again. Then, aftera little pause, everyone remembered that they must save the battery.

They climbed the stair again and made up a good fire and lay down close together forwarmth. The ground was very hard and uncomfortable, but they fell asleep in the end.
