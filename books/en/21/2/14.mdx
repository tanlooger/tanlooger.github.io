title: CHAPTER 14. HOW ALL WERE VERY BUSY
---

A LITTLE before two o'clock Trumpkin and the Badger sat with the rest of the creaturesat the wood's edge looking across at the gleaming line of Miraz's army which was abouttwo arrow-shots away. In between, a square space of level grass had been staked for thecombat. At the two far corners stood Glozelle and Sopespian with drawn swords. At thenear corners were Giant Wimbleweather and the Bulgy Bear, who in spite of all theirwarnings was sucking his paws and looking, to tell the truth, uncommonly silly. To makeup for this, Glenstorm on the right of the lists, stock-still except when he stamped a hindhoof occasionally on the turf, looked much more imposing than the Telmarine baron who

faced him on the left. Peter had just shaken hands with Edmund and the Doctor, and wasnow walking down to the combat. It was like the moment before the pistol goes at animportant race, but very much worse.

"I wish Aslan had turned up before it came to this," said Trumpkin.

"So do I," said Trufflehunter. "But look behind you."

"Crows and crockery!" muttered the Dwarf as soon as he had done so. "What are they?

Huge people - beautiful people - like gods and goddesses and giants. Hundreds andthousands of them, closing in behind us. What are they?"

"It's the Dryads and Hamadryads and Silvans," said Trufflehunter. "Aslan has wakedthem."

"Humph!" said the Dwarf. "That'll be very useful if the enemy try any treachery. But itwon't help the High King very much if Miraz proves handier with his sword."

The Badger said nothing, for now Peter and Miraz were entering the lists from oppositeends, both on foot, both in chain shirts, with helmets and shields. They advanced till theywere close together. Both bowed and seemed to speak,, but it was impossible to hearwhat they said. Next moment, the two swords flashed in the sunlight. For a second theclash could be heard but it was immediately drowned because both armies beganshouting like crowds at a football match.

"Well done, Peter, oh, well done!" shouted Edmund as he saw Miraz reel back a wholepace and a half. "Follow it up, quick!" And Peter did, and for a few seconds it looked asif the fight might be won. But then Miraz pulled himself together - began to make realuse of his height and weight "Miraz! Miraz! The King! The King!" came the roar of theTelmarines. Caspian and Edmund grew white with sickening anxiety.

"Peter is taking some dreadful knocks," said Edmund.

"Hullo!" said Caspian. "What's happening now?"

"Both falling apart," said Edmund. "A bit blown, expect. Watch. Ah, now they'rebeginning again, more scientifically this time. Circling round and round, feeling eachother's defences."

"I'm afraid this Miraz knows his work," muttered the Doctor. But hardly had he said thiswhen there was such a clapping and baying and throwing up of hoods among the OldNarnians that it was nearly deafening.

"What was it? What was it?" asked the Doctor. "My old eyes missed it."

"The High King has pricked him in the arm-pit," said Caspian, still clapping. "Just wherethe arm-hole of the hauberk let the point through. First blood.'

"It's looking ugly again now, though," said Edmund. "Peter's not using his shieldproperly. He must be hurt in the left arm."

It was only too true. Everyone could see that Peter's shield hung limp. The shouting ofthe Telmarines redoubled.

"You've seen more battles than I," said Caspian. "Is there any chance now?"

"Precious little," said Edmund. "I suppose he might just do it. With luck."

"Oh, why did we let it happen at all?" said Caspian.

Suddenly all the shouting on both sides died down. Edmund was puzzled for a moment.

Then he said, "Oh, I see. They've both agreed to a rest. Come on, Doctor. You and I maybe able to do something for the High King.' They ran down to the lists and Peter cameoutside the ropes to meet them, his face red and sweaty, his chest heaving.

"Is your left arm wounded?" asked Edmund.

"It's not exactly a wound," Peter said. "I got the weight of his shoulder on my shield - likea load of bricks and the rim of the shield drove into my wrist. I don't think it's broken, butit might be a sprain. If you could tie it up very tight I think I could manage."

While they were doing this, Edmund asked anxiously. "What do you think of him,Peter?"

"Tough," said Peter. "Very tough. I have a chance if can keep him on the hop till hisweight and short wind come against him - in this hot sun too. To tell the truth, I haven'tmuch chance else. Give my love to - to everyone at home, Ed, if he gets me. Here hecomes into the lists again

So long, old chap. Good-bye, Doctor. And I say, Ed, say something specially nice toTrumpkin. He's been a brick."

Edmund couldn't speak. He walked back with the Doctor to his own lines with a sickfeeling in his stomach.

But the new bout went well. Peter now seemed to be able to make some use of his shield,and he certainly made good use of his feet. He was almost playing Tig with Miraz now,keeping out of range, shifting his ground, making the enemy work.

"Coward!" booed the Telmarines. "Why don't you stand up to him? Don't you like it, eh?

Thought you'd come to fight, not dance. Yah!"

"Oh, I do hope he won't listen to them," said Caspian.

"Not he," said Edmund. "You don't know him - Oh!" for Miraz had got in a blow at last,on Peter's helmet. Peter staggered, slipped sideways, and fell on one knee. The roar of theTelmarines rose like the noise of the sea. "Now, Miraz," they yelled. "Now. Quick!

Quick! Kill him." But indeed there was no need to egg the usurper on. He was on top ofPeter already. Edmund bit his lips till the blood came, as the sword flashed down onPeter. It looked as if it would slash off his head. Thank heavens! It had glanced down hisright shoulder. The Dwarf-wrought mail was sound and did not break.

"Great Scott!" cried Edmund. "He's up again. Peter, go it, Peter."

"I couldn't see what happened," said the Doctor. "How did he do it?"

"Grabbed Miraz's arm as it came down," said Trumpkin, dancing with delight. "There's aman for you! Uses his enemy's arm as a ladder. The High King! The High King! Up, OldNarnia!"

"Look," said Trufflehunter. "Miraz is angry. It is good." They were certainly at it hammerand tongs now: such a flurry of blows that it seemed impossible for either not to be killed.

As the excitement grew, the shouting almost died away. The spectators were holdingtheir breath. It was most horrible and most magnificent.

A great shout arose from the Old Narnians. Miraz was a down - not struck by Peter, butface downwards, having tripped on a tussock. Peter stepped back, waiting for him to rise.

"Oh bother, bother, bother," said Edmund to himself. "Need he be as gentlemanly as allthat? I suppose he must. Comes of being a Knight and a High King. I suppose it is whatAslan would like. But that brute will be up again in a minute and then -"

But "that brute" never rose. The Lords Glozelle and Sopespian had their own plans ready.

As soon as they saw their King down they leaped into the lists crying, "Treachery!

Treachery! The Narnian traitor has stabbed him in the back while he lay helpless. Toarms! To arms, Telmar!"

Peter hardly understood what was happening. He saw two big men running towards himwith drawn swords. Then the third Telmarine had leaped over the ropes on his; left. "Toarms, Narnia! Treachery!" Peter shouted. If all three had set upon him at once he wouldnever have spoken again. But Glozelle stopped to stab his own King dead where he lay:"That's for your insult, this morning," he whispered as the blade went home. Peter swungto face Sopespian, slashed his legs from under him and, with the back-cut of the samestroke, walloped off his head Edmund was now at his side crying, "Narnia, Narnia! TheLion!" The whole Telmarine army was rushing toward them. But now the Giant wasstamping forward, stooping low and swinging his club. The Centaurs charged. Twang,

twang behind and hiss, hiss overhead came the archery of Dwarfs. Trumpkin was fightingat his left. Full battle was joined.

"Come back, Reepicheep, you little ass!" shouted Peter. "You'll only be killed. This is noplace for mice." But the ridiculous little creatures were dancing in and out among the feetof both armies, jabbing with their swords. Many a Telmarine warrior that day felt his footsuddenly pierced as if by a dozen skewers, hopped on one leg cursing the pain, and fell asoften as not. If he fell, the mice finished him off; if he did not, someone else did.

But almost before the Old Narnians were really warmed to their work they found theenemy giving way. Toughlooking warriors turned white, gazed in terror not on the OldNarnians but on something behind them, and then flung down their weapons, shrieking,"The Wood! The Wood! The end of the world!"

But soon neither their cries nor the sound of weapons could be heard any more, for bothwere drowned in the ocean-like roar of the Awakened Trees as they plunged through theranks of Peter's army, and then on, in pursuit of the Telmarines. Have you ever stood atthe edge of a great wood on a high ridge when a wild south-wester broke over it in fullfury on an autumn evening? Imagine that sound. And then imagine that the wood, insteadof being fixed to one place, was rushing at you; and was no longer trees but huge people;yet still like trees because their long arms waved like branches and their heads tossed andleaves fell round them in showers. It was like that for the Telmarines. It was a littlealarming even for the Narnians. In a few minutes all Miraz's followers were runningdown to the Great River in the hope of crossing the bridge to the town of Beruna andthere defending themselves behind ramparts and closed gates.

They reached the river, but there was no bridge. It had disappeared since yesterday. Thenutter panic and horror fell upon them and they all surrendered.

But what had happened to the bridge?

Early that morning, after a few hours' sleep, the girls had waked, to see Aslan standingover them and to hear his voice saying, "We will make holiday." They rubbed their eyesand looked round them. The trees had all gone but could still be seen moving awaytowards Aslan's How in a dark mass. Bacchus and the Maenads - his fierce, madcap girls- and Silenus were still with them. Lucy, fully rested, jumped up. Everyone was awake,everyone was laughing, flutes were playing, cymbals clashing. Animals, not TalkingAnimals, were crowding in upon them from every direction.

"What is it, Aslan?" said Lucy, her eyes dancing and her feet wanting to dance.

"Come, children," said he. "Ride on my back again today."

"Oh, lovely!" cried Lucy, and both girls climbed on to the warm golden back as they haddone no one knew how many years before. Then the whole party moved off Aslan

leading, Bacchus and his Maenads leaping, rushing, and turning somersaults, the beastsfrisking round them, and Silenus and his donkey bringing up the rear.

They turned a little to the right, raced down a steep hill, and found the long Bridge ofBeruna in front of them. Before they had begun to cross it, however, up out of the watercame a great wet, bearded head, larger than a man's, crowned with rushes. It looked atAslan and out of its mouth a deep voice came.

"Hail, Lord," it said. "Loose my chains."

"Who on earth is that?" whispered Susan.

"I think it's the river-god, but hush," said Lucy.

"Bacchus," said Aslan. "Deliver him from his chains."

"That means the bridge, I expect," thought Lucy. And so it did. Bacchus and his peoplesplashed forward into the shallow water, and a minute later the most curious things beganhappening. Great, strong trunks of ivy came curling up all the piers of the bridge,growing as quickly as a fire grows, wrapping the stones round, splitting, breaking,separating them. The walls of the bridge turned into hedges gay with hawthorn for amoment and then disappeared as the whole thing with a rush and a rumble collapsed intothe swirling water. With much splashing, screaming, and laughter the revellers waded orswam or danced across the ford ("Hurrah! It's the Ford of Beruna again now!" cried thegirls) and up the bank on the far side and into the town.

Everyone in the streets fled before their faces. The first house they came to was a school:a girls' school, where lot of Narnian girls, with their hair done very tight and ugly tightcollars round their necks and thick tickly stockings on their legs, were having a historylesson. The sort of "History" that was taught in Narnia under Miraz's rule was duller thanthe truest history you ever read and less true than the most exciting adventure story.

"If you don't attend, Gwendolen," said the mistress, and stop looking out of the window, Ishall have to give you an order-mark."

"But please, Miss Prizzle -" began Gwendolen.

"Did you hear what I said, Gwendolen?" asked Miss Prizzle.

"But please, Miss Prizzle," said Gwendolen, "there's a LION!"

"Take two order-marks for talking nonsense," said Miss Prizzle. "And now -" A roarinterrupted her. Ivy came curling in at the windows of the classroom. The walls became amass of shimmering green, and leafy branches arched overhead where the ceiling hadbeen. Miss Prizzle found she was standing on grass in a forest glade. She clutched at herdesk to steady herself, and found that the desk was a rose-bush. Wild people such as she

had never even imagined were crowding round her. Then she saw the Lion, screamed andfled, and with her fled her class, who were mostly dumpy, prim little girls with fat legs.

Gwendolen hesitated.

"You'll stay with us, sweetheart?" said Aslan.

"Oh, may I? Thank you, thank you," said Gwendolen. Instantly she joined hands with twoof the Maenads, who whirled her round in a merry dance and helped her take off some ofthe unnecessary and uncomfortable clothes that she was wearing.

Wherever they went in the little town of Beruna it was the same. Most of the people fled,a few joined them. When they left the town they were a larger and a merrier company.

They swept on across the level fields on the north bank, or left bank, of the river. Atevery farm animals came out to join them. Sad old donkeys who had never known joygrew suddenly young again; chained dogs broke their chains; horses kicked their carts topieces and came trotting along with them - clop-clop - kicking up the mud andwhinnying.

At a well in a yard they met a man who was beating a boy. The stick burst into flower inthe man's hand. He tried to drop it, but it stuck to his hand. His arm became a branch, hisbody the trunk of a tree, his feet took root. The boy, who had been crying a momentbefore, burst out laughing and joined them.

At a little town half-way to Beaversdam, where two rivers met, they came to anotherschool, where a tiredlooking girl was teaching arithmetic to a number of boys who lookedvery like pigs. She looked out of the window and saw the divine revellers singing up thestreet and a stab of joy went through her heart. Aslan stopped right under the window andlooked up at her.

"Oh, don't, don't," she said. "I'd love to. But I mustn't. I must stick to my work. And thechildren would be frightened if they saw you."

"Frightened?" said the most pig-like of the boys. "Who's she talking to out of thewindow? Let's tell the inspector she talks to people out of the window when she ought tobe teaching us."

"Let's go and see who it is," said another boy, and they all came crowding to the window.

But as soon as their mean little faces looked out, Bacchus gave a great cry of Euan, euoi-

oi-oi-of and the boys all began howling with fright and trampling one another down toget out of the door and jumping out of the windows. And it was said afterwards (whethertruly or not) that those particular little boys were never seen again, but that there were alot of very fine little pigs in that part of the country which had never been there before.

"Now, Dear Heart," said Aslan to the Mistress, and she jumped down and joined them.

At Beaversdam they re-crossed the river and came east again along the southern bank.

They came to a little cottage where a child stood in the doorway crying. "Why are youcrying, my love?" asked Aslan. The child, who had never seen a picture of a lion, was notafraid of him. "Auntie's very ill," she said. "She's going to die." Then Aslan went to go inat the door of the cottage, but it was too small for him. So, when he had got his headthrough, he pushed with his shoulders (Lucy and Susan fell off when he did this) andlifted the whole house up and it fell backwards and apart. And there, still in her bed,though the bed was now in the open air, lay a little old woman who looked as if she hadDwarf blood in her. She was at death's door, but when she opened her eyes and saw thebright, hairy head of the lion staring into her face, she did not scream or faint. She said,"Oh, Aslan! I knew it was true. I've been waiting for this all my life. Have you come totake me away?"

"Yes, Dearest," said Aslan. "But not the long journey yet." And as he spoke, like the flushcreeping along the underside of a cloud at sunrise, the colour came back to her white faceand her eyes grew bright and she sat up and said, "Why, I do declare I feel that better. Ithink I could take a little breakfast this morning."

"Here you are, mother," said Bacchus, dipping a pitcher in the cottage well and handing itto her. But what was in it now was not water but the richest wine, red as red-currant jelly,smooth as oil, strong as beef, warming as tea, cool as dew.

"Eh, you've done something to our well," said the old woman. "That makes a nicechange, that does." And she jumped out of bed.

"Ride on me," said Aslan, and added to Susan and Lucy, "You two queens will have torun now."

"But we'd like that just as well," said Susan. And off they went again.

And so at last, with leaping and dancing and singing, with music and laughter and roaringand barking and neighing, they all came to the place where Miraz's army stood flingingdown their swords and holding up their hands, and Peter's army, still holding theirweapons and breathing hard, stood round them with stern and glad faces. And the firstthing that happened was that the old woman slipped off Aslan's back and ran across toCaspian and they embraced one another; for she was his old nurse.
