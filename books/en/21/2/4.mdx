title: CHAPTER 4. THE DWARF TELLS OF PRINCE CASPIAN
---

PRINCE CASPIAN lived in a great castle in the centre of Narnia with his uncle, Miraz,the King of Narnia, and his aunt, who had red hair and was called Queen Prunaprismia.

His father and mother were dead and the person whom Caspian loved best was his nurse,and though (being a prince) he had wonderful toys which would do almost anything buttalk, he liked best the last hour of the day when the toys had all been put back in theircupboards and Nurse would tell him stories.

He did not care much for his uncle and aunt, but about twice a week his uncle would sendfor him and they would walk up and down together for half an hour on the terrace at thesouth side of the castle. One day, while they were doing this, the King said to him,

"Well, boy, we must soon teach you to ride and use a sword. You know that your auntand I have no children, so it looks as if you might have to be King when I'm gone. Howshall you like that, eh?"

"I don't know, Uncle," said Caspian.

"Don't know, eh?" said Miraz. "Why, I should like to know what more anyone could wishfor!"

"All the same, I do wish," said Caspian.

"What do you wish?" asked the King.

"I wish - I wish - I wish I could have lived in the Old Days," said Caspian. (He was onlya very little boy at the time.)

Up till now King Miraz had been talking in the tiresome way that some grown-ups have,which makes it quite clear that they are not really interested in what you are saying, butnow he suddenly gave Caspian a very sharp look.

"Eh? What's that?" he said. "What old days do you mean?"

"Oh, don't you know, Uncle?" said Caspian. "When everything was quite different. Whenall the animals could talk, and there were nice people who lived in the streams and thetrees. Naiads and Dryads they were called. And there were Dwarfs. And there werelovely little Fauns in all the woods. They had feet like goats. And -"

"That's all nonsense, for babies," said the King sternly. "Only fit for babies, do you hear?

You're getting too old for that sort of stuff. At your age you ought to be thinking ofbattles and adventures, not fairy tales."

"Oh, but there were battles and adventures in those days," said Caspian. "Wonderfuladventures. Once there was a White Witch and she made herself Queen of the wholecountry. And she made it so that it was always winter. And then two boys and two girlscame from somewhere and so they killed the Witch and they were made Kings andQueens of Narnia, and their names were Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy. And sothey reigned for ever so long and everyone had a lovely time, and it was all because ofAslan -"

"Who's he?" said Miraz. And if Caspian had been a very little older, the tone of hisuncle's voice would have warned him that it would be wiser to shut up. But he babbledon,

"Oh, don't you know?" he said. "Aslan is the great Lion who comes from over the sea."

"Who has been telling you all this nonsense?" said the King in a voice of thunder.

Caspian was frightened and said nothing.

"Your Royal Highness," said King Miraz, letting go of Caspian's hand, which he hadbeen holding till now, "I insist upon being answered. Look me in the face. Who has beentelling you this pack of lies?"

"N - Nurse," faltered Caspian, and burst into tears.

"Stop that noise," said his uncle, taking Caspian by the shoulders and giving ham a shake.

"Stop it. And never let me catch you talking - or thinking either - about all those sillystories again. There never were those Kings and Queens. How could there be two Kingsat the same time? And there's no such person as Aslan. And there are no such things aslions. And there never was a time when animals could talk. Do you hear?"

"Yes, Uncle," sobbed Caspian.

"Then let's have no more of it," said the King. Then he called to one of the gentlemen-in-

waiting who were standing at the far end of the terrace and said in a cold voice, "ConductHis Royal Highness to his apartments and send His Royal Highness's nurse to me ATONCE."

Next day Caspian found what a terrible thing he had done, for Nurse had been sent awaywithout even being allowed to say good-bye to him, and he was told he was to have aTutor.

Caspian missed his nurse very much and shed many tears; and because he was somiserable, he thought about the old stories of Narnia far more than before. He dreamed ofDwarfs and Dryads every night and tried very hard to make the dogs and cats in the castletalk to him. But the dogs only wagged their tails and the cats only purred.

Caspian felt sure that he would hate the new Tutor, buy when the new Tutor arrivedabout a week later he turns out to be the sort of person it is almost impossible not to like.

He was the smallest, and also the fattest, man Caspian had ever seen. He had a long,silvery, pointed beard which came down to his waist, and his face, which was brown andcovered with wrinkles, looked very wise, very ugly, and very kind. His voice was graveand his eyes were merry so that, until you got to know him really well, it was hard toknow when he was joking and when he was serious. His name was Doctor Cornelius.

Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History. Uptill now, except for Nurse's stories, he had known nothing about the History of Narnia,and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in the country.

"It was your Highness's ancestor, Caspian the First," said Doctor Cornelius, "who firstconquered Narnia and made it his kingdom. It was he who brought all your nation intothe country. You are not native Narnians at all. You are all Telmarines - that is, you allcame from the Land of Telmar, far beyond the Western Mountains. That is why Caspianthe First is called Caspian the Conqueror."

"Please, Doctor," asked Caspian one day, "who lived in Narnia before we all came hereout of Telmar?"

"No men - or very few - lived in Narnia before the Telmarines took it," said DoctorCornelius.

"Then who did my great-great-grandcesters conquer?"

"Whom, not who, your Highness," said Doctor Cornelius. "Perhaps it is time to turn fromHistory to Grammar."

"Oh please, not yet!" said Caspian.

"I mean, wasn't there a battle? Why is he called Caspian the Conqueror if there wasnobody to fight with him?"

"I said there were very few men in Narnia," said the Doctor, looking at the little boy verystrangely through his great spectacles.

For a moment Caspian was puzzled and then suddenly his heart gave a leap. "Do youmean," he gasped, "that there were other things? Do you mean it was like in the stories?

Were there-?"

"Hush!" said Doctor Cornelius, laying his head very close to Caspian's. "Not a wordmore. Don't you know your Nurse was sent away for telling you about Old Narnia? TheKing doesn't like it. If he found me telling you secrets, you'd be whipped and I shouldhave my head cut off."

"But why?" asked Caspian.

"1t is high time we turned to Grammar now," said Doctor Cornelius in a loud voice. "Willyour Royal Highness be pleased to open Pulverulentus Siccus at the fourth page of hisGrammatical garden or the Arbour of Accidence pleasantlie open'd to Tender Wits?"

After that it was all nouns and verbs till lunchtime, but I don't think Caspian learnedmuch. He was too excited. He felt sure that Doctor Cornelius would not have said somuch unless he meant to tell him more sooner or later.

In this he was not disappointed. A few days later his Tutor said, "Tonight I am going togive you a lesson in Astronomy. At dead of night two noble planets, Tarva and Alambil,will pass within one degree of each other. Such a conjunction has not occurred for twohundred years, and your Highness will not live to see it again. It will be best if you go tobed a little earlier than usual. When the time of the conjunction draws near I will comeand wake you."

This didn't seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia, which was what Caspian reallywanted to hear about, but getting up in the middle of the night is always interesting andhe was moderately pleased. When he went to bed that night, he thought at first that hewould not be able to sleep; but he soon dropped off and it seemed only a few minutesbefore he felt someone gently shaking him.

He sat up in bed and saw that the room was full of moonlight. Doctor Cornelius, muffledin a hooded robe and holding a small lamp in his hand, stood by the bedside.

Caspian remembered at once what they were going to do. He got up and put on someclothes. Athough it was a summer night he felt colder than he had expected and was quiteglad when the Doctor wrapped him in a robe like his own and gave him a pair of warm,soft buskins for his feet. A moment later, both muffled so that they could hardly be seenin the dark corridors, and both shod so that they made almost no noise, master and pupilleft the room.

Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases, and atlast, through a little door in a turret, they came out upon the leads. On one side were thebattlements, on the other a steep roof; below them, all shadowy and shimmery, the castlegardens; above them, stars and moon. Presently they came to another door, which led intothe great central tower of the whole castle: Doctor Cornelius unlocked it and they beganto climb the dark winding stair of the tower. Caspian was becoming excited; he had neverbeen allowed up this stair before.

It was long and steep, but when they came out on the roof of the tower and Caspian hadgot his breath, he felt that it had been well worth it. Away on his right he could see, ratherindistinctly, the Western Mountains. On his left was the gleam of the Great River, andeverything was so quiet that he could hear the sound of the waterfall at Beaversdam, amile away. There was no difficulty in picking out the two stars they had come to see.

They hung rather low in the southern sky, almost as bright as two little moons and veryclose together.

"Are they going to have a collision?" he asked in an awestruck voice.

"Nay, dear Prince," said the Doctor (and he too spoke in a whisper). "The great lords ofthe upper sky know the steps of their dance too well for that. Look well upon them. Theirmeeting is fortunate and means some great good for the sad realm of Narnia. Tarva, theLord of Victory, salutes Alambil, the Lady of Peace. They are just coming to theirnearest."

"It's a pity that tree gets in the way," said Caspian. "We'd really see better from the WestTower, though it is not so high."

Doctor Cornelius said nothing for about two minutes, but stood still with his eyes fixedon Tarva and Alambil. Then he drew a deep breath and turned to Caspian.

"There," he said. "You have seen what no man now alive has seen, nor will see again.

And you are right. We should have seen it even better from the smaller tower. I broughtyou here for another reason."

Caspian looked up at him, but the Doctor's hood concealed most of his face.

"The virtue of this tower," said Doctor Cornelius, "is that we have six empty roomsbeneath us, and a long stair, and the door at the bottom of the stair is locked. We cannotbe overheard."

"Are you going to tell me what you wouldn't tell me the other day?" said Caspian.

"I am," said the Doctor. "But remember. You and I must never talk about these thingsexcept here - on the very top of the Great Tower."

"No. That's a promise," said Caspian. "But do go on, please."

"Listen," said the Doctor. "All you have heard about Old Narnia is true. It is not the landof Men. It is the country of Aslan, the country of the Waking Trees and Visible Naiads,of Fauns and Satyrs, of Dwarfs and Giants, of the gods and the Centaurs, of TalkingBeasts. It was against these that the first Caspian fought. It is you Telmarines whosilenced the beasts and the trees and the fountains, and who killed and drove away theDwarfs and Fauns, and are now trying to cover up even the memory of them. The Kingdoes not allow them to be spoken of."

"Oh, I do wish we hadn't," said Caspian. "And I am glad it was all true, even if it is allover."

"Many of your race wish that in secret," said Doctor Cornelius.

"But, Doctor," said Caspian, "why do you say my race? After all, I suppose you're aTelmarine too."

"Am I?" said the Doctor.

"Well, you're a Man anyway," said Caspian.

"Am I?" repeated the Doctor in a deeper voice, at the same moment throwing back hishood so that Caspian could see his face clearly in the moonlight.

All at once Caspian realized the truth and felt that he ought to have realized it longbefore. Doctor Cornelius was so small, and so fat, and had such a very long beard. Twothoughts came into his head at the same moment. One was a thought of terror - "He's nota real man, not a man at all, he's a Dwarf, and he's brought me up here to kill me." Theother was sheer delight - "There are real Dwarfs still, and I've seen one at last."

"So you've guessed it in the end," said Doctor Cornelius. "Or guessed it nearly right. I'mnot a pure Dwarf. I have human blood in me too. Many Dwarfs escaped in the greatbattles and lived on, shaving their beards and wearing highheeled shoes and pretending tobe men. They have mixed with your Telmarines. I am one of those, only a halfDwarf, andif any of my kindred, the true Dwarfs, are still alive anywhere in the world, doubtlessthey would despise me and call me a traitor. But never in all these years have weforgotten our own people and all the other happy creatures of Narnia, and the long-lostdays of freedom."

"I'm - I'm sorry, Doctor," said Caspian. "It wasn't my fault, you know."

"I am not saying these things in blame of you, dear Prince," answered the Doctor. "Youmay well ask why I say them at all. But I have two reasons. Firstly, because my old hearthas carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if I didnot whisper them to you. But secondly, for this: that when you become King you mayhelp us, for I know that you also, Telmarine though you are, love the Old Things."

"I do, I do," said Caspian. "But how can I help?"

"You can be kind to the poor remnants of the Dwarf people, like myself. You can gatherlearned magicians and try to find a way of awaking the trees once more. You can searchthrough all the nooks and wild places of the land to see if any Fauns or Talking Beasts orDwarfs are perhaps still alive in hiding."

"Do you think there are any?" asked Caspian eagerly.

"I don't know - I don't know," said the Doctor with a deep sigh. "Sometimes I am afraidthere can't be. I have been looking for traces of them all my life. Sometimes I havethought I heard a Dwarf-drum in the mountains. Sometimes at night, in the woods, Ithought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing a long way off; but when Icame to the place, there was never anything there. I have often despaired; but somethingalways happens to start me hoping again. I don't know. But at least you can try to be aKing like the High King Peter of old, and not like your uncle."

"Then it's true about the Kings and Queens too, and about the White Witch?" saidCaspian.

"Certainly it is true," said Cornelius. "Their reign was the Golden Age in Narnia and theland has never forgotten them."

"Did they live in this castle, Doctor?"

"Nay, my dear," said the old man. "This castle is a thing of yesterday. Your great-great-

grandfather built it. But when the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve weremade Kings and Queens of Narnia by Aslan himself, they lived in the castle of CairParavel. No man alive has seen that blessed place and perhaps even the ruins of it havenow vanished. But we believe it was far from here, down at the mouth of the Great River,on the very shore of the sea."

"Ugh!" said Caspian with a shudder. "Do you mean in the Black Woods? Where all the -

the - you know, the ghosts live?"

"Your Highness speaks as you have been taught," said the Doctor. "But it is all lies.

There are no ghosts there. That is a story invented by the Telmarines. Your Kings are indeadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comesfrom over the sea. They don't want to go near it and they don't want anyone else to gonear it. So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast. Butbecause they have quarrelled with the trees they are afraid of the woods. And becausethey are afraid of the woods they imagine that they are full of ghosts. And the Kings andgreat men, hating both the sea and the wood, partly believe these stories, and partlyencourage them. They feel safer if no one in Narnia dares to go down to the coast andlook out to sea towards Aslan's land and the morning and the eastern end of the world."

There was a deep silence between them for a few minutes. Then Doctor Cornelius said,"Come. We have been here long enough. It is time to go down and to bed."

"Must we?" said Caspian. "I'd like to go on talking about these things for hours and hoursand hours."

"Someone might begin looking for us, if we did that," said Doctor Cornelius.
