title: CHAPTER 7. OLD NARNIA IN DANGER
---

THE place where they had met the Fauns was, of course, Dancing Lawn itself, and hereCaspian and his friends remained till the night of the great Council. To sleep under thestars, to drink nothing but well water and to live chiefly on nuts and wild fruit, was astrange experience for Caspian after his bed with silken sheets in a tapestried chamber atthe castle, with meals laid out on gold and silver dishes in the anteroom, and attendantsready at his call. But he had never enjoyed himself more. Never had sleep been morerefreshing nor food tasted more savoury, and he began already to harden and his facewore a kinglier look.

When the great night came, and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawnby ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens - the moon then shining almost at herfull - his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings. All whom hehad met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs, Moles and Badgers,Hares and Hedgehogs, and others whom he had not yet seen - five Satyrs as red as foxes,the whole contingent of Talking Mice, armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet,some Owls, the Old Raven of Ravenscaur. Last of all (and this took Caspian's breathaway), with the Centaurs came a small but genuine Giant, Wimbleweather of Deadman's

Hill, carrying on his back a basketful of rather sea-sick Dwarfs who had accepted hisoffer of a lift and were now wishing they had walked instead.

The Bulgy Bears were very anxious to have the feast first and leave the council tillafterwards: perhaps till tomorrow. Reepicheep and his Mice said that councils and feastscould both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very night.

Pattertwig and the other Squirrels said they could talk and eat at the same time, so whynot have the council and feast all at once? The Moles proposed throwing upentrenchments round the Lawn before they did anything else. The Fauns thought it wouldbe better to begin with a solemn dance. The Old Raven, while agreeing with the Bearsthat it would take too long to have a full council before supper, begged to be allowed togive a brief address to the whole company. But Caspian and the Centaurs and the Dwarfsoverruled all these suggestions and insisted on holding a real council of war at once.

When all the other creatures had been persuaded to sit down quietly in a great circle, andwhen (with more difficulty) they had got Pattertwig to stop running to and fro and saying"Silence! Silence, everyone, for the King's speech", Caspian, feeling a little nervous, gotup. "Narnians!" he began, but he never got any further, for at that very moment Camillothe Hare said, "Hush! There's a Man somewhere near."

They were all creatures of the wild, accustomed to being hunted, and they all became stillas statues. The beasts all turned their noses in the direction which Camillo had indicated.

"Smells like Man and yet not quite like Man," whispered Trufflehunter.

"It's getting steadily nearer," said Camillo.

"Two badgers and you three Dwarfs, with your bows at the - ready, go softly off to meetit," said Caspian.

"We'll settle 'un," said a Black Dwarf grimly, fitting a shaft to his bowstring.

"Don't shoot if it is alone," said Caspian. "Catch it."

"Why?" asked the Dwarf.

"Do as you're told," said Glenstorm the Centaur.

Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthilyacross to the trees on the northwest side of the Lawn. Then came a sharp dwarfish cry,"Stop! Who goes there?" and a sudden spring. A moment later a voice, which Caspianknew well, could he heard saying, "All right, all right, I'm unarmed. Take my wrists ifyou like, worthy Badgers, but don't bite right through them. I want to speak to the King."

"Doctor Cornelius!" cried Caspian with joy, and rushed forward to greet his old tutor.

Everyone else crowded round.

"Pah!" said Nikabrik. "A renegade Dwarf. A half-and-halfer! Shall I pass my swordthrough its throat?"

"Be quiet, Nikabrik," said Trumpkin. "The creature can't help its ancestry."

"This is my greatest friend and the saviour of my life," said Caspian. "And anyone whodoesn't like his company may leave my army: at once. Dearest doctor, I am glad to seeyou again. How ever did you find us out?"

"By a little use of simple magic, your Majesty," said the Doctor, who was still puffingand blowing from having walked so fast. "But there's no time to go into that now. Wemust all fly from this place at once. You are already betrayed and Miraz is on the move.

Before midday tomorrow you will be surrounded."

"Betrayed!" said Caspian. "And by whom?"

"Another renegade Dwarf, no doubt," said Nikabrik.

"By your horse Destrier," said Doctor Cornelius. "The poor brute knew no better. Whenyou were knocked off, of course, he went dawdling back to his stable in the castle. Thenthe secret of your flight was known. I made myself scarce, having no wish to bequestioned about it in Miraz's torture chamber. I had a pretty good guess from my crystalas to where I should find you. But all day - that was the day before yesterday - I sawMiraz's tracking parties out in the woods. Yesterday I learned that his army is out. I don'tthink some of your - um - pure-blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might beexpected. You've left tracks all over the place. Great carelessness. At any rate somethinghas warned Miraz that Old Narnia is not so dead as he had hoped, and he is on the move."

"Hurrah!" said a very shrill and small voice from somewhere at the Doctor's feet. "Letthem come! All I ask is that the King will put me and my people in the front."

"What on earth?" said Doctor Cornelius. "Has your Majesty got grasshoppers - ormosquitoes - in your army?" Then after stooping down and peering carefully through hisspectacles, he broke into a laugh.

"By the Lion," he swore, "it's a mouse. Signior Mouse, I desire your better acquaintance.

I am honoured by meeting so valiant a beast."

"My friendship you shall have, learned Man," piped Reepicheep. "And any Dwarf - orGiant - in the army who does not give you good language shall have my sword to reckonwith."

"Is there time for this foolery?" asked Nikabrik. "What are our plans? Battle or flight?"

"Battle if need be," said Trumpkin. "But we are hardly ready for it yet, and this is no verydefensible place."

"I don't like the idea of running away," said Caspian.

"Hear him! Hear him!" said the Bulgy Bears. "Whatever we do, don't let's have anyrunning. Especially not before supper; and not too soon after it neither."

"Those who run first do not always run last," said the Centaur. "And why should we letthe enemy choose our position instead of choosing it ourselves? Let us find a strongplace."

"That's wise, your Majesty, that's wise," said Trufflehunter.

"But where are we to go?" asked several voices.

"Your Majesty," said Doctor Cornelius, "and all you variety of creatures, I think we mustfly east and down the river to the great woods. The Telmarines hate that region. Theyhave always been afraid of the sea and of something that may come over the sea. That iswhy they have let the great woods grow up. If traditions speak true, the ancient CairParavel was at the river-mouth. All that part is friendly to us and hateful to our enemies.

We must go to Aslan's How."

"Aslan's How?" said several voices. "We do not know what it is."

"It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it is a huge mound which Narnians raisedin very ancient times over a very magical place, where there stood - and perhaps stillstands - a very magical Stone. The Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries andcaves, and the Stone is in the central cave of all. There is room in the mound for all ourstores, and those of us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed tounderground life can be lodged in the caves. The rest of us can lie in the wood. At a pinchall of us (except this worthy Giant) could retreat into the Mound itself, and there weshould be beyond the reach of every danger except famine."

"It is a good thing we have a learned man among us," said Trufflehunter; but Trumpkinmuttered under his breath, "Soup and celery! I wish our leaders would think less aboutthese old wives' tales and more about victuals and arms." But all approved of Cornelius'sproposal and that very night, half an hour later, they were on the march. Before sunrisethey arrived at Aslan's How.

It was certainly an awesome place, a round green hill on top of another hill, long sincegrown over with trees, and one little, low doorway leading into it. The tunnels insidewere a perfect maze till you got to know them, and they were lined and roofed withsmooth stones, and on the stones, peering in the twilight, Caspian saw strange charactersand snaky patterns, and pictures in which the form of a Lion was repeated again and

again. It all seemed to belong to an even older Narnia than the Narnia of which his nursehad told him.

It was after they had taken up their quarters in and around the How that fortune began toturn against them. King Miraz's scouts soon found their new lair, and he and his armyarrived on the edge of the woods. And as so often happens, the enemy turned out strongerthan they had reckoned. Caspian's heart sank as he saw company after company arriving.

And though Miraz's men may have been afraid of going into the wood, they were evenmore afraid of Miraz, and with him in command they carried battle deeply into it andsometimes almost to the How itself. Caspian and other captains of course made manysorties into the open country. Thus there was fighting on most days and sometimes bynight as well; but Caspian's party had on the whole the worst of it.

At last there came a night when everything had gone as badly as possible, and the rainwhich had been falling heavily all day had ceased at nightfall only to give place to rawcold. That morning Caspian had arranged what was his biggest battle yet, and all hadhung their hopes on it. He, with most of the Dwarfs, was to have fallen on the King'sright wing at daybreak, and then, when they were heavily engaged, GiantWimbleweather, with the Centaurs and some of the fiercest beasts, was to have brokenout from another place and endeavoured to cut the King's right off from the rest of thearmy. But it had all failed. No one had warned Caspian (because no one in these laterdays of

Narnia remembered) that Giants are not at all clever. Poor Wimbleweather, though asbrave as a lion, was a true Giant in that respect. He had broken out at the wrong time andfrom the wrong place, and both his party and Caspian's had suffered badly and done theenemy little harm. The best of the Bears had been hurt, a Centaur terribly wounded, andthere were few in Caspian's party who had not lost blood. It was a gloomy company thathuddled under the dripping trees to eat their scanty supper.

The gloomiest of all was Giant Wimbleweather. He knew it was all his fault. He sat insilence shedding big tears which collected on the end of his nose and then fell off with ahuge splash on the whole bivouac of the Mice, who had just been beginning to get warmand drowsy. They all jumped up, shaking the water out of their ears and wringing theirlittle blankets, and asked the Giant in shrill but forcible voices whether he thought theyweren't wet enough without this sort of thing. And then other people woke up and told theMice they had been enrolled as scouts and not as a concert party, and asked why theycouldn't keep quiet. And Wimbleweather tiptoed away to find some place where he couldbe miserable in peace and stepped on somebody's tail and somebody (they saidafterwards it was a fox) bit him. And so everyone was out of temper.

But in the secret and magical chamber at the heart of the How, King Caspian, withCornelius and the Badger and Nikabrik and Trumpkin, were at council. Thick pillars ofancient workmanship supported the roof. In the centre was the Stone itself - a stone table,split right down the centre, and covered with what had once been writing of some kind:but ages of wind and rain and snow had almost worn them away in old times when the

Stone Table had stood on the hilltop, and the Mound had not yet been built above it. Theywere not using the Table nor sitting round it: it was too magic a thing for any commonuse. They sat on logs a little way from it, and between them was a rough wooden table,on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces and throwing big shadows onthe walls.

"If your Majesty is ever to use the Horn," said Trufflehunter, "I think the time has nowcome." Caspian had of course told them of his treasure several days ago.

"We are certainly in great need," answered Caspian. "But it is hard to be sure we are atour greatest. Supposing there came an even worse need and we had already used it?"

"By that argument," said Nikabrik, "your Majesty will never use it until it is too late."

"I agree with that," said Doctor Cornelius.

"And what do you think, Trumpkin?" asked Caspian.

"Oh, as for me," said the Red Dwarf, who had been listening with complete indifference,"your Majesty knows I think the Horn - and that bit of broken stone over there and yourgreat King Peter - and your Lion Aslan - are all eggs in moonshine. It's all one to mewhen your Majesty blows the Horn. All I insist on is that the army is told nothing aboutit. There's no good raising hopes of magical help which (as I think) are sure to bedisappointed."

"Then in the name of Aslan we will wind Queen Susan's Horn," said Caspian.

"There is one thing, Sire," said Doctor Cornelius, "that should perhaps be done first. Wedo not know what form the help will take. It might call Aslan himself from oversea. But Ithink it is more likely to call Peter the High King and his mighty consorts down from thehigh past. But in either case, I do not think we can be sure that the help will come to thisvery spot -"

"You never said a truer word," put in Trumpkin.

"I think," went on the learned man, "that they - or he will come back to one or other ofthe Ancient Places of Narnia. This, where we now sit, is the most ancient and mostdeeply magical of all, and here, I think, the answer is likeliest to come. But there are twoothers. One Lantern Waste, up-river, west of Beaversdam, where the Royal Children firstappeared in Narnia, as the records tell The other is down at the river-mouth, where theircastle of Cair Paravel once stood. And if Aslan himself comes, that would be the bestplace for meeting him too, for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor-

over-the-Sea, and over the sea he will pass. I should like very much to send messengersto both places, to Lantern Waste and the river-mouth, to receive them - or him or it."

"Just as I thought," muttered Trumpkin. "The first result of all this foolery is not to bringus help but to lose us two fighters."

"Who would you think of sending, Doctor Cornelius?" asked Caspian.

"Squirrels are best for getting through enemy country without being caught," saidTrufflehunter.

"All our squirrels (and we haven't many)," said Nikabrik, "are rather flighty. The onlyone I'd trust on a job like that would be Pattertwig."

"Let it be Pattertwig, then," said King Caspian. "And who for our other messenger? Iknow you'd go, Trufflehunter, but you haven't the speed. Nor you, Doctor Cornelius."

"I won't go," said Nikabrik. "With all these Humans and beasts about, there must be aDwarf here to see that the Dwarfs are fairly treated."

"Thimbles and thunderstorms!" cried Trumpkin in a rage. "Is that how you speak to theKing? Send me, Sire, I'll go."

"But I thought you didn't believe in the Horn, Trumpkin," said Caspian.

"No more I do, your Majesty. But what's that got to do with it? I might as well die on awild goose chase as die here. You are my King. I know the difference between givingadvice and taking orders. You've had my advice, and now it's the time for orders."

"I will never forget this, Trumpkin," said Caspian. "Send for Pattertwig, one of you. Andwhen shall I blow the Horn?"

"I would wait for sunrise, your Majesty," said Doctor Cornelius. "That sometimes has aneffect in operations of White Magic."

A few minutes later Pattertwig arrived and had his task explained to him. As he was, likemany squirrels, full of courage and dash and energy and excitement and mischief (not tosay conceit), he no sooner heard it than he was eager to be off. It was arranged that heshould run for Lantern Waste while Trumpkin made the shorter journey to the river-

mouth. After a hasty meal they both set off with the fervent thanks and good wishes ofthe King, the Badger, and Cornelius.
