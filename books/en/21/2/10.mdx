title: CHAPTER 10. THE RETURN OF THE LION
---

To keep along the edge of the gorge was not so easy as it had looked. Before they hadgone many yards they were confronted with young fir woods growing on the very edge,and after they had tried to go through these, stooping and pushing for about ten minutes,they realized that, in there, it would take them an hour to do half a mile. So they cameback and out again and decided to go round the fir wood. This took them much farther totheir right than they wanted to go, far out of sight of the cliffs and out of sound of theriver, till they began to be afraid they had lost it altogether. Nobody knew the time, but itwas getting to the hottest part of the day.

When they were able at last to go back to the edge of the gorge (nearly a mile below thepoint from which they had started) they found the cliffs on their side of it a good deallower and more broken. Soon they found a way down into the gorge and continued thejourney at the river's edge. But first they had a rest and a long drink. No one was talkingany more about breakfast, or even dinner, with Caspian.

They may have been wise to stick to the Rush instead of going along the top. It kept themsure of their direction: and ever since the fir wood they had all been afraid of beingforced too far out of their course and losing themselves in the wood. It was an old andpathless forest, and you could not keep anything like a straight course in it. Patches ofhopeless brambles, fallen trees, boggy places and dense undergrowth would be alwaysgetting in your way. But the gorge of the Rush was not at all a nice place for travellingeither. I mean, it was not a nice place for people in a hurry. For an afternoon's rambleending in a picnic tea it would have been delightful. It had everything you could want onan occasion of that sort - rumbling waterfalls, silver cascades, deep, amber-colouredpools, mossy rocks, and deep moss on the banks in which you could sink over yourankles, every kind of fern, jewel-like dragon flies, sometimes a hawk overhead and once(Peter and Trumpkin. both thought) an eagle. But of course what the children and theDwarf wanted to see as soon as possible was the Great River below them, and Beruna,and the way to Aslan's How.

As they went on, the Rush began to fall more and more steeply. Their journey becamemore and more of a climb and less and less of a walk - in places even a dangerous climbover slippery rock with a nasty drop into dark chasms, and the river roaring angrily at thebottom.

You may be sure they watched the cliffs on their left eagerly for any sign of a break orany place where they could climb them; but those cliffs remained cruel. It wasmaddening, because everyone knew that if once they were out of the gorge on that side,they would have only a smooth slope and a fairly short walk to Caspian's headquarters.

The boys and the Dwarf were now in favour of lighting a fire and cooking their bear-

meat. Susan didn't want this; she only wanted, as she said, "to get on and finish it and getout of these beastly woods". Lucy was far too tired and miserable to have any opinionabout anything. But as there was no dry wood to be had, it mattered very little whatanyone thought. The boys began to wonder if raw meat was really as nasty as they hadalways been told. Trumpkin assured them it was.

Of course, if the children had attempted a journey like this a few days ago in England,they would have been knocked up. I think I have explained before how Narnia wasaltering them. Even Lucy was by now, so to speak, only one-third of a little girl going toboarding school for the first time, and two-thirds of Queen Lucy of Narnia.

"At last!" said Susan.

"Oh, hurray!" said Peter.

The river gorge had just made a bend and the whole view spread out beneath them. Theycould see open country stretching before them to the horizon and, between it and them,the broad silver ribbon of the Great River. They could see the specially broad and shallowplace which had once been the Fords of Beruna but was now spanned by a long, many-

arched bridge. There was a little town at the far end of it.

"By Jove," said Edmund. "We fought the Battle of Beruna just where that town is!"

This cheered the boys more than anything. You can't help feeling stronger when you lookat a place where you won a glorious victory not to mention a kingdom, hundreds of yearsago. Peter and Edmund were soon so busy talking about the battle that they forgot theirsore feet and the heavy drag of their mail shirts on their shoulders. The Dwarf wasinterested too.

They were all getting on at a quicker pace now. The going became easier. Though therewere still sheer cliffs on their left, the ground was becoming lower on their right. Soon itwas no longer a gorge at all, only a valley. There were no more waterfalls and presentlythey were in fairly thick woods again.

Then - all at once - whizz, and a sound rather like the stroke of a woodpecker. Thechildren were still wondering where (ages ago) they had heard a sound just like that andwhy they disliked it so, when Trumpkin shouted, "Down', at the same moment forcingLucy (who happened to be next to him) flat down into the bracken. Peter, who had beenlooking up to see if he could spot a squirrel, had seen what it was - a long cruel arrow hadsunk into a tree trunk just above his head. As he pulled Susan down and dropped himself,another came rasping over his shoulder and struck the ground at his side.

"Quick! Quick! Get back! Crawl!" panted Trumpkin.

They turned and wriggled along uphill, under the bracken amid clouds of horriblybuzzing flies. Arrows whizzed round them. One struck Susan's helmet with a sharp pingand glanced off. They crawled quicker. Sweat poured off them. Then they ran, stoopingnearly double. The boys held their swords in their hands for fear they would trip them up.

It was heart-breaking work - all uphill again, back over the ground they had alreadytravelled. When they felt that they really couldn't run any more, even to save their lives,they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder,panting. They were surprised to see how high they had already got.

They listened intently and heard no sound of pursuit.

"So that's all right," said Trumpkin, drawing a deep breath. "They're not searching thewood. Only sentries, I expect. But it means that Miraz has an outpost down there. Bottlesand battledores! though, it was a near thing."

"I ought to have my head smacked for bringing us this way at all," said Peter.

"On the contrary, your Majesty," said the Dwarf. "For one thing it wasn't you, it was yourroyal brother, King Edmund, who first suggested going by Glasswater."

"I'm afraid the D.L.F.'s right," said Edmund, who had quite honestly forgotten this eversince things began going wrong.

"And for another," continued Trumpkin, "if we'd gone my way, we'd have walkedstraight into that new outpost, most likely; or at least had just the same trouble avoidingit. I think this Glasswater route has turned out for the best."

"A blessing in disguise," said Susan.

"Some disguise!" said Edmund.

"I suppose we'll have to go right up the gorge again now," said Lucy.

"Lu, you're a hero," said Peter. "That's the nearest you've got today to saying I told youso. Let's get on."

"And as soon as we're well up into the forest," said Trumpkin, "whatever anyone says,I'm going to light a fire and cook supper. But we must get well away from here."

There is no need to describe how they toiled back up the gorge. It was pretty hard work,but oddly enough everyone felt more cheerful. They were getting their second wind; andthe word supper had had a wonderful effect.

They reached the fir wood which had caused them so much trouble while it was stilldaylight, and bivouacked in a hollow just above it. It was tedious gathering the firewood;but it was grand when the fire blazed up and they began producing the damp and smearyparcels of bear-meat which would have been so very unattractive to anyone who hadspent the day indoors. The Dwarf had splendid ideas about cookery. Each apple (they stillhad a few of these) was wrapped up in bear's meat - as if it was to be apple dumplingwith meat instead of pastry, only much thicker - and spiked on a sharp stick and thenroasted. And the juice of the apple worked all through the meat, like apple sauce withroast pork. Bear that has lived too much on other animals is not very nice, but bear thathas had plenty of honey and fruit is excellent, and this turned out to be that sort of bear. Itwas a truly glorious meal. And, of course, no washing up - only lying back and watchingthe smoke from Trumpkin's pipe and stretching one's tired legs and chatting. Everyonefelt quite hopeful now about finding King Caspian tomorrow and defeating Miraz in afew days. It may not have been sensible of them to feel like this, but they did.

They dropped off to sleep one by one, but all pretty quickly.

Lucy woke out of the deepest sleep you can imagine, with the feeling that the voice sheliked best in the world had been calling her name. She thought at first it was her father'svoice, but that did not seem quite right. Then she thought it was Peter's voice, but that didnot seem to fit either. She did not want to get up; not because she was still tired - on thecontrary she was wonderfully rested and all the aches had gone from her bones - butbecause she felt so extremely happy and comfortable. She was looking straight up at theNarnian moon, which is larger than ours, and at the starry sky, for the place where theyhad bivouacked was comparatively open.

"Lucy," came the call again, neither her father's voice nor Peter's. She sat up, tremblingwith excitement but not with fear. The moon was so bright that the whole forestlandscape around her was almost as clear as day, though it looked wilder. Behind her wasthe fir wood; away to her right the jagged cliff-tops on the far side of the gorge; straightahead, open grass to where a glade of trees began about a bow-shot away. Lucy lookedvery hard at the trees of that glade.

"Why, I do believe they're moving," she said to herself. "They're walking about."

She got up, her heart beating wildly, and walked towards them. There was certainly anoise in the glade, a noise such as trees make in a high wind, though there was no windtonight. Yet it was not exactly an ordinary treenoise either. Lucy felt there was a tune in

it, but she could not catch the tune any more than she had been able to catch the wordswhen the trees had so nearly talked to her the night before. But there was, at least, a lilt;she felt her own feet wanting to dance as she got nearer. And now there was no doubt thatthe trees were really moving moving in and out through one another as if in acomplicated country dance. ("And I suppose," thought Lucy, "when trees dance, it mustbe a very, very country dance indeed.') She was almost among them now.

The first tree she looked at seemed at first glance to be not a tree at all but a huge manwith a shaggy beard and great bushes of hair. She was not frightened: she had seen suchthings before. But when she looked again he was only a tree, though he was still moving.

You couldn't see whether he had feet or roots, of course, because when trees move theydon't walk on the surface of the earth; they wade in it as we do in water. The same thinghappened with every tree she looked at. At one moment they seemed to be the friendly,lovely giant and giantess forms which the tree-people put on when some good magic hascalled them into full life: next moment they all looked like trees again. But when theylooked like trees, it was like strangely human trees, and when they looked like people, itwas like strangely branchy and leafy people - and all the time that queer lilting, rustling,cool, merry noise.

"They are almost awake, not quite," said Lucy. She knew she herself was wide awake,wider than anyone usually is.

She went fearlessly in among them, dancing herself as she leaped this way and that toavoid being run into by these huge partners. But she was only half interested in them. Shewanted to get beyond them to something else; it was from beyond them that the dearvoice had called.

She soon got through them (half wondering whether she had been using her arms to pushbranches aside, or to take hands in a Great Chain with big dancers who stooped to reachher) for they were really a ring of trees round a central open place. She stepped out fromamong their shifting confusion of lovely lights and shadows.

A circle of grass, smooth as a lawn, met her eyes, with dark trees dancing all round it.

And then - oh joy! For he was there: the huge Lion, shining white in the moonlight, withhis huge black shadow underneath him.

But for the movement of his tail he might have been a stone lion, but Lucy never thoughtof that. She never stopped to think whether he was a friendly lion or not. She rushed tohim. She felt her heart would burst if she lost a moment. And the next thing she knewwas that she was kissing him and putting her arms as far round his neck as she could andburying her face in the beautiful rich silkiness of his mane.

"Aslan, Aslan. Dear Aslan," sobbed Lucy. "At last."

The great beast rolled over on his side so that Lucy fell, half sitting and half lyingbetween his front paws. He bent forward and just touched her nose with his tongue. Hiswarm breath came all round her. She gazed up into the large wise face.

"Welcome, child," he said.

"Aslan," said Lucy, "you're bigger."

"That is because you are older, little one," answered he.

"Not because you are?"

"I am not. But every year you grow, you will find me bigger."

For a time she was so happy that she did not want to speak. But Aslan spoke.

"Lucy," he said, "we must not lie here for long. You have work in hand, and much timehas been lost today."

"Yes, wasn't it a shame?" said Lucy. "I saw you all right. They wouldn't believe me.

They're all so -"

From somewhere deep inside Aslan's body there came the faintest suggestion of a growl.

"I'm sorry," said Lucy, who understood some of his moods. "I didn't mean to startslanging the others. But it wasn't my fault anyway, was it?"

The Lion looked straight into her eyes.

"Oh, Aslan," said Lucy. "You don't mean it was? How could I - I couldn't have left theothers and come up to you alone, how could I? Don't look at me like that . . . oh well, Isuppose I could. Yes, and it wouldn't have been alone, I know, not if I was with you. Butwhat would have been the good?"

Aslan said nothing.

"You mean," said Lucy rather faintly, "that it would have turned out all right - somehow?

But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?"

"To know what would have happened, child?" said Aslan. "No. Nobody is ever told that."

"Oh dear," said Lucy.

"But anyone can find out what will happen," said Aslan. "If you go back to the othersnow, and wake them up; and tell them you have seen me again; and that you must all getup at once and follow me - what will happen? There is only one way of finding out."

"Do you mean that is what you want me to do?" gasped Lucy.

"Yes, little one," said Aslan.

"Will the others see you too?" asked Lucy.

"Certainly not at first," said Aslan. "Later on, it depends."

"But they won't believe me!" said Lucy.

"It doesn't matter," said Aslan.

"Oh dear, oh dear," said Lucy. "And I was so pleased at finding you again. And I thoughtyou'd let me stay. And I thought you'd come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away- like last time. And now everything is going to be horrid."

"It is hard for you, little one," said Aslan. "But things never happen the same way twice.

It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now."

Lucy buried her head in his mane to hide from his face. But there must have been magicin his mane. She could feel lion-strength going into her. Quite suddenly she sat up.

"I'm sorry, Aslan," she said. "I'm ready now."

"Now you are a lioness," said Aslan. "And now all Narnia will be renewed. But come.

We have no time to lose."

He got up and walked with stately, noiseless paces back to the belt of dancing treesthrough which she had just come: and Lucy went with him, laying a rather tremuloushand on his mane. The trees parted to let them through and for one second assumed theirhuman forms completely. Lucy had a glimpse of tall and lovely wood-gods and wood-

goddesses all bowing to the Lion; next moment they were trees again, but still bowing,with such graceful sweeps of branch and trunk that their bowing was itself a kind ofdance.

"Now, child," said Aslan, when they had left the trees behind them, "I will wait here. Goand wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then you at least must followme alone."

It is a terrible thing to have to wake four people, all older than yourself and all very tired,for the purpose of telling them something they probably won't believe and making themdo something they certainly won't like. "I mustn't think about it, I must just do it,"thought Lucy.

She went to Peter first and shook him. "Peter," she whispered in his ear, "wake up. Quick.

Aslan is here. He says we've got to follow him at once."

"Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like," said Peter unexpectedly. This was encouraging, butas Peter instantly rolled round and went to sleep again it wasn't much use.

Then she tried Susan. Susan did really wake up, but only to say in her most annoyinggrown-up voice, "You've been dreaming, Lucy. Go to sleep again."

She tackled Edmund next. It was very difficult to wake him, but when at last she haddone it he was really awake and sat up.

"Eh?" he said in a grumpy voice. "What are you talking about?"

She said it all over again. This was one of the worst parts of her job, for each time shesaid it, it sounded less convincing.

"Aslan!" said Edmund, jumping up. "Hurray! Where?"

Lucy turned back to where she could see the Lion waiting, his patient eyes fixed uponher. "There," she said, pointing.

"Where?" asked Edmund again.

"There. There. Don't you see? Just this side of the trees."

Edmund stared hard for a while and then said, "No. There's nothing there. You've gotdazzled and muddled with the moonlight. One does, you know. I thought I sawsomething for a moment myself. It's only an optical what-do-you-call-it."

"I can see him all the time," said Lucy. "He's looking straight at us."

"Then why can't I see him?"

"He said you mightn't be able to."

"Why?"

"I don't know. That's what he said."

"Oh, bother it all," said Edmund. "I do wish you wouldn't keep on seeing things. But Isuppose we'll have to wake the others."
