title: CHAPTER 9. WHAT LUCY SAW
---

SUSAN and the two boys were bitterly tired with rowing before they rounded the lastheadland and began the final pull up Glasswater itself, and Lucy's head ached from thelong hours of sun and the glare on the water. Even Trumpkin longed for the voyage to beover. The seat on which he sat to steer had been made for men, not Dwarfs, and his feetdid not reach the floor-boards; and everyone knows how uncomfortable that is even for

ten minutes. And as they all grew more tired, their spirits fell. Up till now the childrenhad only been thinking of how to get to Caspian. Now they wondered what they woulddo when they found him, and how a handful of Dwarfs and woodland creatures coulddefeat an army of grown-up Humans.

Twilight was coming on as they rowed slowly up the windings of Glasswater Creek - atwilight which deepened as the banks drew closer together and the overhanging treesbegan almost to meet overhead. It was very quiet in here as the sound of the sea diedaway behind them; they could even hear the trickle of the little streams that poured downfrom the forest into Glasswater.

They went ashore at last, far too tired to attempt lighting a fire; and even a supper ofapples (though most of them felt that they never wanted to see an apple again) seemedbetter than trying to catch or shoot anything. After a little silent munching they allhuddled down together in the moss and dead leaves between four large beech trees.

Everyone except Lucy went to sleep at once. Lucy, being far less tired, found it hard toget comfortable. Also, she had forgotten till now that all Dwarfs snore. She knew that oneof the best ways of getting to sleep is to stop trying, so she opened her eyes.

Through a gap in the bracken and branches she could just see a patch of water in theCreek and the sky above it. Then, with a thrill of memory, she saw again, after all thoseyears, the bright Narnian stars. She had once known them better than the stars of our ownworld, because as a Queen in Narnia she had gone to bed much later than as a child inEngland. And there they were - at least, three of the summer constellations could be seenfrom where she lay: the Ship, the Hammer, and the Leopard. "Dear old Leopard," shemurmured happily to herself.

Instead of getting drowsier she was getting more awake - with an odd, night-time,dreamish kind of wakefulness. The Creek was growing brighter. She knew now that thenmoon was on it, though she couldn't see the moon. And now she began to feel that thewhole forest was coming awake like herself. Hardly knowing why she did it, she got upquickly and walked a little distance away from their bivouac.

"This is lovely," said Lucy to herself. It was cool and fresh, delicious smells were floatingeverywhere.

Somewhere close by she heard the twitter of a nightingale beginning to sing, thenstopping, then beginning again. It was a little lighter ahead. She went towards the lightand came to a place where there were fewer trees, and whole patches or pools ofmoonlight, but the moonlight and the shadows so mixed that you could hardly be surewhere anything was or what it was. At the same moment the nightingale, satisfied at lastwith his tuning up, burst into full song.

Lucy's eyes began to grow accustomed to the light, and she saw the trees that werenearest her more distinctly. A great longing for the old days when the trees could talk in

Narnia came over her. She knew exactly how each of these trees would talk if only shecould wake them, and what sort of human form it would put on. She looked at a silverbirch: it would have a soft, showery voice and would look like a slender girl, with hairblown all about her face, and fond of dancing. She looked at the oak: he would be awizened, but hearty old man with a frizzled beard and warts on his face and hands, andhair growing out of the warts. She looked at the beech under which she was standing. Ah!

she would be the best of all. She would be a gracious goddess, smooth and stately, thelady of the wood.

"Oh, Trees, Trees, Trees," said Lucy (though she had not been intending to speak at all).

"Oh, Trees, wake, wake, wake. Don't you remember it? Don't you remember me? Dryadsand Hamadryads, come out, come to me."

Though there was not a breath of wind they all stirred about her. The rustling noise of theleaves was almost like words. The nightingale stopped singing as if to listen to it.

Lucy felt that at any moment she would begin to understand what the trees were trying tosay. But the moment did not come. The rustling died away. The nightingale resumed itssong. Even in the moonlight the wood looked more ordinary again. Yet Lucy had thefeeling (as you sometimes have when you are trying to remember a name or a date andalmost get it, but it vanishes before you really do) that she had just missed something: asif she had spoken to the trees a split second too soon or a split second too late, or used allthe right words except one, or put in one word that was just wrong.

Quite suddenly she began to feel tired. She went back to the bivouac, snuggled downbetween Susan and Peter, and was asleep in a few minutes.

It was a cold and cheerless waking for them all next morning, with a grey twilight in thewood (for the sun had not yet risen) and everything damp and dirty.

"Apples, heigh-ho," said Trumpkin with a rueful grin. "I must say you ancient kings andqueens don't overfeed your courtiers!"

They stood up and shook themselves and looked about. The trees were thick and theycould see no more than a few yards in any direction.

"I suppose your Majesties know the way all right?" said the Dwarf.

"I don't," said Susan. "I've never seen these woods in my life before. In fact I thought allalong that we ought to have gone by the river."

"Then I think you might have said so at the time," answered Peter, with pardonablesharpness.

"Oh, don't take any notice of her," said Edmund. "She always is a wet blanket. You've gotthat pocket compass of yours, Peter, haven't you? Well, then, we're as right as rain. We've

only got to keep on going north-west - cross that little river, the what-do-you-call-it? - theRush -"

"I know," said Peter. "The one that joins the big river at the Fords of Beruna, or Beruna'sBridge, as the D.L.F. calls it."

"That's right. Cross it and strike uphill, and we'll be at the Stone Table (Aslan's How, Imean) by eight or nine o'clock. I hope King Caspian will give us a good breakfast!"

"I hope you're right," said Susan. "I can't remember all that at all."

"That's the worst of girls," said Edmund to Peter and the Dwarf. "They never carry a mapin their heads."

"That's because our heads have something inside them," said Lucy.

At first things seemed to be going pretty well. They even -thought they had struck an oldpath; but if you know anything about woods, you will know that one is always findingimaginary paths. They disappear after about five minutes and then you think you havefound another (and hope it is not another but more of the same one) and it alsodisappears, and after you have been well lured out of your right direction you realize thatnone of them were pats at all. The boys and the Dwarf, however, were used to woods andwere not taken in for more than a few seconds.

They had plodded on for about half an hour (three of them very stiff from yesterday'srowing) when Trumpkin suddenly whispered, "Stop." They all stopped. "There'ssomething following us," he said in a low voice. "Or rather, something keeping up withus: over there on the left." They all stood still, listening and staring till their ears and eyesached. "You and I'd better each have an arrow on the string," said Susan to Trumpkin.

The Dwarf nodded, and when both bows were ready for action the party went on again.

They went a few dozen yards through fairly open woodland, keeping a sharp look-out.

Then they came to a place where the undergrowth thickened and they had to pass nearerto it. Just as they were passing the place, there came a sudden something that snarled andflashed, rising out from the breaking twigs like a thunderbolt. Lucy was knocked downand winded, hearing the twang of a bowstring as she fell. When she was able to takenotice of things again, she saw a great grim-looking grey bear lying dead withTrumpkin's arrow in its side.

"The D.L.F. beat you in that shooting match, Su," said #Peter, with a slightly forcedsmile. Even he had been shaken by this adventure.

"I - I left it too late," said Susan, in an embarrassed voice. "I was so afraid it might be,you know - one of our kind of bears, a talking bear." She hated killing things.

"That's the trouble of it," said Trumpkin, "when most of the beasts have gone enemy andgone dumb, but there are still some of the other kind left. You never know, and youdaren't wait to see."

"Poor old Bruin," said Susan. "You don't think he was?"

"Not he," said the Dwarf. "I saw the face and I heard the snarl. He only wanted Little Girlfor his breakfast. And talking of breakfast, I didn't want to discourage your Majestieswhen you said you hoped King Caspian would give you a good one: but meat's preciousscarce in camp. And there's good eating on a bear. It would be a shame to leave thecarcass without taking a bit, and it won't delay us more than half an hour. I dare say youtwo youngsters - Kings, I should say - know how to skin a bear?"

"Let's go and sit down a fair way off," said Susan to Lucy. "I know what a horrid messybusiness that will be." Lucy shuddered and nodded. When they had sat down she said:"Such a horrible idea has come into my head, Su. "

"What's that?"

"Wouldn't it be dreadful if some day, in our own world, at home, men started going wildinside, like the animals here, and still looked like men, so that you'd never know whichwere which?"

"We've got enough to bother about here and now in Narnia," said the practical Susan,"without imagining things like that."

When they rejoined the boys and the Dwarf, as much as they thought they could carry ofthe best meat had been cut off. Raw meat is not a nice thing to fill one's pockets with, butthey folded it up in fresh leaves and made the best of it. They were all experiencedenough to know that they would feel quite differently about these squashy and unpleasantparcels when they had walked long enough to be really hungry.

On they trudged again (stopping to wash three pairs of hands that needed it in the firststream they passed) until the sun rose and the birds began to sing, and more flies thanthey wanted were buzzing in the bracken. The stiffness from yesterday's rowing began towear off. Everybody's spirits rose. The sun grew warmer and they took their helmets offand carried them.

"I suppose we are going right?" said Edmund about an hour later.

"I don't see how we can go wrong as long as we don't bear too much to the left," saidPeter. "If we bear too much to the right, the worst that can happen is wasting a little timeby striking the great River too soon and not cutting off the corner."

And again they trudged on with no sound except the thud of their feet and the jingle oftheir chain shirts.

"Where's this bally Rush got to?" said Edmund a good deal later.

"I certainly thought we'd have struck it by now," said Peter. "But there's nothing to do butkeep on." They both knew that the Dwarf was looking anxiously at them, but he saidnothing.

And still they trudged on and their mail shirts began to feel very hot and heavy.

"What on earth?" said Peter suddenly.

They had come, without seeing it, almost to the edge of a small precipice from whichthey looked down into a gorge with a river at the bottom. On the far side the cliffs rosemuch higher. None of the party except Edmund (and perhaps Trumpkin) was a rockclimber.

"I'm sorry," said Peter. "It's my fault for coming this way. We're lost. I've never seen thisplace in my life before."

The Dwarf gave a low whistle between his teeth.

"Oh, do let's go back and go the other way," said Susan. "I knew all along we'd get lost inthese woods."

"Susan!" said Lucy, reproachfully, "don't nag at Peter like that. It's so rotten, and he'sdoing all he can."

"And don't you snap at Su like that, either," said Edmund. "I think she's quite right."

"Tubs and tortoiseshells!" exclaimed Trumpkin. "If we've got lost coming, what chancehave we of finding our way back? And if we're to go back to the Island and begin all overagain - even supposing we could - we might as well give the whole thing up. Miraz willhave finished with Caspian before we get there at that rate."

"You think we ought to go on?" said Lucy.

"I'm not sure the High King is lost," said Trumpkin. "What's to hinder this river being theRush?"

"Because the Rush is not in a gorge," said Peter, keeping his temper with some difficulty.

"Your Majesty says is," replied the Dwarf, "but oughtn't you to say was? You knew thiscountry hundreds - it may be a thousand - years ago. Mayn't it have changed? A landslidemight have pulled off half the side of that hill, leaving bare rock, and there are yourprecipices beyond the gorge. Then the Rush might go on deepening its course year after

year till you get the little precipices this side. Or there might have been an earthquake, oranything."

"I never thought of that," said Peter.

"And anyway," continued Trumpkin, "even if this is not the Rush, it's flowing roughlynorth and so it must fall into the Great River anyway. I think I passed something thatmight have been it, on my way down. So if we go downstream, to our right, we'll hit theGreat River. Perhaps not so high as we'd hoped, but at least we'll be no worse off than ifyou'd come my way."

"Trumpkin, you're a brick," said Peter. "Come on, then. Down this side of the gorge."

"Look! Look! Look!" cried Lucy.

"Where? What?" said everyone.

"The Lion," said Lucy. "Aslan himself. Didn't you see?" Her face had changedcompletely and her eyes shone.

"Do you really mean -?" began Peter.

"Where did you think you saw him?" asked Susan.

"Don't talk like a grown-up," said Lucy, stamping her foot. "I didn't think I saw him. Isaw him."

"Where, Lu?" asked Peter.

"Right up there between those mountain ashes. No, this side of the gorge. And up, notdown. Just the opposite of the way you want to go. And he wanted us to go where he was- up there."

"How do you know that was what he wanted?" asked Edmund.

"He - I - I just know," said Lucy, "by his face."

The others all looked at each other in puzzled silence.

"Her Majesty may well have seen a lion," put in Trumpkin. "There are lions in thesewoods, I've been told. But it needn't have been a friendly and talking lion any more thanthe bear was a friendly and talking bear."

"Oh, don't be so stupid," said Lucy. "Do you think I don't know Aslan when I see him?"

"He'd be a pretty elderly lion by now," said Trumpkin, "if he's one you knew when youwere here before! And if it could be the same one, what's to prevent him having gonewild and witless like so many others?"

Lucy turned crimson and I think she would have flown at Trumpkin, if Peter had not laidhis hand on her arm. "The D.L.F. doesn't understand. How could he? You must just takeit, Trumpkin, that we do really know about Aslan; a little bit about him, I mean. And youmustn't talk about him like that again. It isn't lucky for one thing: and it's all nonsense foranother. The only question is whether Aslan was really there."

"But I know he was," said Lucy, her eyes filling with tears.

"Yes, Lu, but we don't, you see," said Peter.

"There's nothing for it but a vote," said Edmund.

"All right," replied Peter. "You're the eldest, D.L.F. What do you vote for? Up or down?"

"Down," said the Dwarf. "I know nothing about Aslan. But I do know that if we turn leftand follow the gorge up, it might lead us all day before we found a place where we couldcross it. Whereas if we turn right and go down, we're bound to reach the Great River inabout a couple of hours. And if there are any real lions about, we want to go away fromthem, not towards them."

"What do you say, Susan?"

"Don't be angry, Lu," said Susan, "but I do think we should go down. I'm dead tired. Dolet's get out of this wretched wood into the open as quick as we can. And none of usexcept you saw anything."

"Edmund?" said Peter.

"Well, there's just this," said Edmund, speaking quickly and turning a little red. "Whenwe first discovered Narnia a year ago - or a thousand years ago, whichever it is - it wasLucy who discovered it first and none of us would believe her. I was the worst of the lot,I know. Yet she was right after all. Wouldn't it be fair to believe her this time? I vote forgoing up."

"Oh, Ed!" said Lucy and seized his hand.

"And now it's your turn, Peter," said Susan, "and I do hope -"

"Oh, shut up, shut up and let a chap think," interrupted Peter. "I'd much rather not have tovote. "

"You're the High King," said Trumpkin sternly.

"Down," said Peter after a long pause. "I know Lucy may be right after all, but I can'thelp it. We must do one or the other."

So they set off to their right along the edge, downstream. And Lucy came last of theparty, crying bitterly.
