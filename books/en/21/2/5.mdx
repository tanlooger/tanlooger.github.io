title: CHAPTER 5. CASPIAN'S ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS
---

AFTER this, Caspian and his Tutor had many more secret conversations on the top of theGreat Tower, and at each conversation Caspian learned more about Old Narnia, so that

thinking and dreaming about the old days, and longing that they might come back, fillednearly all his spare hours. But of course he had not many hours to spare, for now hiseducation was beginning in earnest. He learned sword-fighting and riding, swimming anddiving, how to shoot with the bow and play on the recorder and the theorbo, how to huntthe stag and cut him up when he was dead, besides Cosmography, Rhetoric, Heraldry,Versification, and of course History, with a little Law, Physic, Alchemy, and Astronomy.

Of Magic he learned only the theory, for Doctor Cornelius said the practical part was notproper study for princes. "And I myself," he added, "am only a very imperfect magicianand can do only the smallest experiments." Of Navigation ("Which is a noble andheroical art," said the Doctor) he was taught nothing, because King Miraz disapproved ofships and the sea.

He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears. As a little boy he had oftenwondered why he disliked his aunt, Queen Prunaprismia; he now saw that it was becauseshe disliked him. He also began to see that Narnia was an unhappy country. The taxeswere high and the laws were stern and Miraz was a cruel man.

After some years there came a time when the Queen seemed to be ill and there was agreat deal of bustle and pother about her in the castle and doctors came and the courtierswhispered. This was in early summertime. And one night, while all this fuss was goingon, Caspian was unexpectedly wakened by Doctor Cornelius after he had been only a fewhours in bed.

"Are we going to do a little Astronomy, Doctor?" said Caspian.

"Hush!" said the Doctor. "Trust me and do exactly as I tell you. Put on all your clothes;you have a long journey before you."

Caspian was very surprised, but he had learned to have confidence in his Tutor and hebegan doing what he was told at once. When he was dressed the Doctor said, "I have awallet for you. We must go into the next room and fill it with victuals from yourHighness's supper table."

"My gentlemen-in-waiting will be there," said Caspian.

"They are fast asleep and will not wake," said the Doctor. "I am a very minor magicianbut I can at least contrive a charmed sleep."

They went into the antechamber and there, sure enough, the two gentlemen-in-waitingwere, sprawling on chairs and snoring hard. Doctor Cornelius quickly cut up the remainsof a cold chicken and some slices of venison and put them, with bread and an apple or soand a little flask of good wine, into the wallet which he then gave to Caspian. It fitted onby a strap over Caspian's shoulder, like a satchel you would use for taking books toschool.

"Have you your sword?" asked the Doctor.

"Yes," said Caspian.

"Then put this mantle over all to hide the sword and the wallet. That's right. And now wemust go to the Great Tower and talk."

When they had reached the top of the Tower (it was a cloudy night, not at all like thenight when they had seen the conjunction of Tarva and Alambil) Doctor Cornelius said,

"Dear Prince, you must leave this castle at once and go to seek your fortune in the wideworld. Your life is in danger here."

"Why?" asked Caspian.

"Because you are the true King of Narnia: Caspian the Tenth, the true son and heir ofCaspian the Ninth. Long life to your Majesty' - and suddenly, to Caspian's great surprise,the little man dropped down on one knee and kissed his hand.

"What does it all mean? I don't understand," said Caspian.

"I wonder you have never asked me before," said the Doctor, "why, being the son of KingCaspian, you are not King Caspian yourself. Everyone except your Majesty knows thatMiraz is a usurper. When he first began to rule he did not even pretend to be the King: hecalled himself Lord Protector. But then your royal mother died, the good Queen and theonly Telmarine who was ever kind to me. And then, one by one, all the great lords, whohad known your father, died or disappeared. Not by accident, either. Miraz weeded themout. Belisar and Uvilas were shot with arrows on a hunting party: by chance, it waspretended. All the great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northernfrontier till one by one they fell. Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more he executed fortreason on a false charge. The two brothers of Beaversdam he shut up as madmen. Andfinally he persuaded the seven noble lords, who alone among all the Telmarines did notfear the sea, to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean, and, as heintended, they never came back. And when there was no one left who could speak a wordfor you, then his flatterers (as he had instructed them) begged him to become King. Andof course he did."

"Do you mean he now wants to kill me too?" said Caspian.

"That is almost certain," said Doctor Cornelius.

"But why now?" said Caspian. "I mean, why didn't he do it long ago if he wanted to? Andwhat harm have I done him?"

"He has changed his mind about you because of something that happened only two hoursago. The Queen has had a son."

"I don't see what that's got to do with it," said Caspian.

"Don't see!" exclaimed the Doctor. "Have all my lessons in History and Politics taughtyou no more than that? Listen. As long as he had no children of his own, he was willingenough that you should be King after he died. He may not have cared much about you,but he would rather you should have the throne than a stranger. Now that he has a son ofhis own he will want his own son to be the next King. You are in the way. He'll clear youout of the way."

"Is he really as bad as that?" said Caspian. "Would he really murder me?"

"He murdered your Father," said Doctor Cornelius.

Caspian felt very queer and said nothing.

"I can tell you the whole story," said the Doctor. "But not now. There is no time. Youmust fly at once."

"You'll come with me?" said Caspian.

"I dare not," said the Doctor. "It would make your danger greater. Two are more easilytracked than one. Dear Prince, dear King Caspian, you must be very brave. You must goalone and at once. Try to get across the southern border to the court of King Nain ofArchenland. He will be good to you."

"Shall I never see you again?" said Caspian in a quavering voice.

"I hope so, dear King," said the Doctor. "What friend have I in the wide world exceptyour Majesty? And I have a little magic. But in the meantime, speed is everything. Hereare two gifts before you go. This is a little purse of gold alas, all the treasure in this castleshould be your own by rights. And here is something far better."

He put in Caspian's hands something which he could hardly see but which he knew bythe feel to be a horn.

"That," said Doctor Cornelius, "is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia. Manyterrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it, when I was still young. It is the magichorn of Queen Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia atthe end of the Golden Age. It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help - noone can say how strange. It may have the power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmundand Queen Susan and High King Peter back from the past, and they will set all to rights.

It may be that it will call up Asian himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use itexcept at your greatest need. And now, haste, haste, haste. The little door at the verybottom of the Tower, the door into the garden, is unlocked. There we must part."

"Can I get my horse Destrier?" said Caspian.

"He is already saddled and waiting for you just at the corner of the orchard."

During the long climb down the winding staircase Cornelius whispered many more wordsof direction and advice. Caspian's heart was sinking, but he tried to take it all in. Thencame the fresh air in the garden, a fervent handclasp with the Doctor, a run across thelawn, a welcoming whinny from Destrier, and so King Caspian the Tenth left the castleof his fathers. Looking back, he saw fireworks going up to celebrate the birth of the newprince.

All night he rode southward, choosing by-ways and bridle paths through woods as longas he was in country that he knew; but afterwards he kept to the high road. Destrier wasas excited as his master at this unusual journey, and Caspian, though tears had come intohis eyes at saying good-bye to Doctor Cornelius, felt brave and, in a way, happy, to thinkthat he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures, with his sword on his left hip andQueen Susan's magic horn on his right. But when day came, with a sprinkle of rain, andhe looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods, wild heaths, and bluemountains, he thought how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small.

As soon as it was full daylight he left the road and found an open grassy place amid awood where he could rest. He took off Destrier's bridle and let him graze, ate some coldchicken and drank a little wine, and presently fell asleep. It was late afternoon when heawoke. He ate a morsel and continued his journey, still southward, by many unfrequentedlanes. He was now in a land of hills, going up and down, but always more up than down.

From every ridge he could see the mountains growing bigger and blacker ahead. As theevening closed in, he was riding their lower slopes. The wind rose. Soon rain fell intorrents.

Destrier became uneasy; there was thunder in the air. And now they entered a dark andseemingly endless pine forest, and all the stories Caspian had ever heard of trees beingunfriendly to Man crowded into his mind. He remembered that he was, after all, aTelmarine, one of the race who cut down trees wherever they could and were at war withall wild things; and though he himself might be unlike other Telmarines, the trees couldnot be expected to know this.

Nor did they. The wind became a tempest, the woods roared and creaked all round them.

There came a crash. A tree fell right across the road just behind him. "Quiet, Destrier,quiet!" said Caspian, patting his horse's neck; but he was trembling himself and knew thathe had escaped death by an inch. Lightning flashed and a great crack of thunder seemedto break the sky in two just overhead.

Destrier bolted in good earnest. Caspian was a good rider, but he had not the strength tohold him back. He kept his seat, but he knew that his life hung by a thread during thewild career that followed. Tree after tree rose up before them in the dusk and was onlyjust avoided. Then, almost too suddenly to hurt (and yet it did hurt him too) somethingstruck Caspian on the forehead and he knew no more.

When he came to himself he was lying in a firelit place with bruised limbs and a badheadache. Low voices were speaking close at hand.

"And now," said one, "before it wakes up we must decide what to do with it."

"Kill it," said another. "We can't let it live. It would betray us."

"We ought to have killed it at once, or else let it alone," said a third voice. "We can't killit now. Not after we've taken it in and bandaged its head and all. It would be murdering aguest."

"Gentlemen," said Caspian in a feeble voice, "whatever you do to me, I hope you will bekind to my poor horse."

"Your horse had taken flight long before we found you," said the first voice - a curiouslyhusky, earthy voice, as Caspian now noticed.

"Now don't let it talk you round with its pretty words," said the second voice. "I still say-"

"Horns and halibuts!" exclaimed the third voice. "Of course we're not going to murder it.

For shame, Nikabrik. What do you say, Trufflehunter? What shall we do with it?"

"I shall give it a drink," said the first voice, presumably Trufflehunter's. A dark shapeapproached the bed. Caspian felt an arm slipped gently under his shoulders - if it wasexactly an arm. The shape somehow seemed wrong. The face that bent towards himseemed wrong too. He got the impression that it was very hairy and very long nosed, andthere were odd white patches on each side of it. "It's a mask of some sort," thoughtCaspian. "Or perhaps I'm in a fever and imagining it all." A cupful of something sweetand hot was set to his lips and he drank. At that moment one of the others poked the fire.

A blaze sprang up and Caspian almost screamed with the shock as the sudden lightrevealed the face that was looking into his own. It was not a man's face but a badger's,though larger and friendlier and more intelligent than the face of any badger he had seenbefore. And it had certainly been talking. He saw, too, that he was on a bed of heather, ina cave. By the fire sat two little bearded men, so much wilder and shorter and hairier andthicker than Doctor Cornelius that he knew them at once for real Dwarfs, ancient Dwarfswith not a drop of human blood in their veins. And Caspian knew that he had found theOld Narnians at last. Then his head began to swim again.

In the next few days he learned to know them by names. The Badger was calledTrufflehunter; he was the oldest and kindest of the three. The Dwarf who had wanted tokill Caspian was a sour Black Dwarf (that is, his hair and beard were black, and thick andhard like horsehair). His name was Nikabrik. The other Dwarf was a Red Dwarf with hairrather like a Fox's and he was called Trumpkin.

"And now," said Nikabrik on the first evening when Caspian was well enough to sit upand talk, "we still have to decide what to do with this Human. You two think you've doneit a great kindess by not letting me kill it. But I suppose the upshot is that we have to keepit a prisoner for life. I'm certainly not going to let it go alive - to go back to its own kindand betray us all."

"Bulbs and bolsters! Nikabrik," said Trumpkin. "Why need you talk so unhandsomely? Itisn't the creature's fault that it bashed its head against a tree outside our hole. And I don'tthink it looks like a traitor."

"I say," said Caspian, "you haven't yet found out whether I want to go back. I don't. Iwant to stay with you - if you'll let me. I've been looking for people like you all my life."

"That's a likely story," growled Nikabrik. "You're a Telmarine and a Human, aren't you?

Of course you want to go back to your own kind."

"Well, even if I did, I couldn't," said Caspian. "I was flying for my life when I had myaccident. The King wants to kill me. If you'd killed me, you'd have done the very thing toplease him."

"Well now," said Trufflehunter, "you don't say so!"

"Eh?" said Trumpkin. "What's that? What have you been doing, Human, to fall foul ofMiraz at your age?"

"He's my uncle," began Caspian, when Nikabrik jumped up with his hand on his dagger.

"There you are!" he cried. "Not only a Telmarine but close kin and heir to our greatestenemy. Are you still mad enough to let this creature live?" He would have stabbedCaspian then and there, if the Badger and Trumpkin had not got in the way and forcedhim back to his seat and held him down.

"Now, once and for all, Nikabrik," said Trumpkin. "Will you contain yourself, or mustTrufflehunter and I sit on your head?"

Nikabrik sulkily promised to behave, and the other two asked Caspian to tell his wholestory. When he had done so there was a moment's silence.

"This is the queerest thing I ever heard," said Trumpkin.

"I don't like it," said Nikabrik. "I didn't know there were stories about us still told amongthe Humans. The less they know about us the better. That old nurse, now. She'd betterhave held her tongue. And it's all mixed up with that Tutor: a renegade Dwarf. I hate 'em.

I hate 'em worse than the Humans. You mark my words - no good will come of it.

"Don't you go talking about things you don't understand, Nikabrik," said Trufflehunter.

"You Dwarfs are as forgetful and changeable as the Humans themselves. I'm a beast, Iam, and a Badger what's more. We don't change. We hold on. I say great good will comeof it. This is the true King of Narnia we've got here: a true King, coming back to trueNarnia. And we beasts remember, even if Dwarfs forget, that Narnia was never rightexcept when a son of Adam was King."

"Whistles and whirligigs! Trufflehunter," said Trumpkin. "You don't mean you want togive the country to Humans?"

"I said nothing about that," answered the Badger. "It's not Men's country (who shouldknow that better than me?) but it's a country for a man to be King of. We badgers havelong enough memories to know that. Why, bless us all, wasn't the High King Peter aMan?"

"Do you believe all those old stories?" asked Trumpkin.

"I tell you, we don't change, we beasts," said Trufflehunter. "We don't forget. I believe inthe High King Peter and the rest that reigned at Cair Paravel, as firmly as I believe inAslan himself."

"As firmly as that, I dare say," said Trumpkin. "But who believes in Aslan nowadays?"

"I do," said Caspian. "And if I hadn't believed in him before, I would now. Back thereamong the Humans the people who laughed at Aslan would have laughed at stories aboutTalking Beasts and Dwarfs. Sometimes I did wonder if there really was such a person asAslan: but then sometimes I wondered if there were really people like you. Yet there youare."

"That's right," said Trufflehunter. "You're right, King Caspian. And as long as you will betrue to Old Narnia you shall be my King, whatever they say. Long life to your Majesty."

"You make me sick, Badger," growled Nikabrik. "The High King Peter and the rest mayhave been Men, but they were a different sort of Men. This is one of the cursedTelmarines. He has hunted beasts for sport. Haven't you, now?" he added, roundingsuddenly on Caspian.

"Well, to tell you the truth, I have," said Caspian. "But they weren't Talking Beasts."

"It's all the same thing," said Nikabrik.

"No, no, no," said Trufflehunter. "You know it isn't. You know very well that the beastsin Narnia nowadays are different and are no more than the poor dumb, witless creaturesyou'd find in Calormen or Telmar. They're smaller too. They're far more different from usthan the half-Dwarfs are from you."

There was a great deal more talk, but it all ended with the agreement that Caspian shouldstay and even the promise that, as soon as he was able to go out, he should be taken to seewhat Trumpkin called "the Others"; for apparently in these wild parts all sorts ofcreatures from the Old Days of Narnia still lived on in hiding.
