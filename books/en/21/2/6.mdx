title: CHAPTER 6. THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN HIDING
---

Now began the happiest times that Caspian had ever known. On a fine summer morningwhen the dew lay on the grass he set off with the Badger and the two Dwarfs, up throughthe forest to a high saddle in the mountains and down on to their sunny southern slopeswhere one looked across the green wolds of Archenland.

"We will go first to the Three Bulgy Bears," said Trumpkin.

They came in a glade to an old hollow oak tree covered with moss, and Trufflehuntertapped with his paw three times on the trunk and there was no answer. Then he tappedagain and a woolly sort of voice from inside said, "Go away. It's not time to get up yet."But when he tapped the third time there was a noise like a small earthquake from insideand a sort of door opened and out came three brown bears, very bulgy indeed andblinking their little eyes. And when everything had been explained to them (which took along time because they were so sleepy) they said, just as Trufflehunter had said, that ason of Adam ought to be King of Narnia and all kissed Caspian - very wet, snuffly kissesthey were - and offered him some honey. Caspian did not really want honey, withoutbread, at that time in the morning, but he thought it polite to accept. It took him a longtime afterwards to get unsticky.

After that they went on till they came among tall beech trees and Trufflehunter called out,"Pattertwig! Pattertwig! Pattertwig!" and almost at once, bounding down from branch tobranch till he was just above their heads, came the most magnificent red squirrel thatCaspian had ever seen. He was far bigger than the ordinary dumb squirrels which he hadsometimes seen in the castle gardens; indeed he was nearly the size of a terrier and themoment you looked in his face you saw that he could talk. Indeed the difficulty was toget him to stop talking, for, like all squirrels, he was a chatterer. He welcomed Caspian atonce and asked if he would like a nut and Caspian said thanks, he would. But asPattertwig went bounding away to fetch it, Trufflehunter whispered in Caspian's ear,"Don't look. Look the other way. It's very bad manners among squirrels to watch anyonegoing to his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it was." Then Pattertwigcame back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after that Pattertwig asked if he could takeany messages to other friends. "For I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot toground," he said. Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gavePattertwig messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling them all to come to a

feast and council on Dancing Lawn at midnight three nights ahead. "And you'd better tellthe three Bulgies too," added Trumpkin. "We forgot to mention it to them."

Their next visit was to the Seven Brothers of Shuddering Wood. Trumpkin led the wayback to the saddle and then down eastward on the northern slope of the mountains tillthey came to a very solemn place among rocks and fir trees. They went very quietly andpresently Caspian could feel the ground shake under his feet as if someone werehammering down below. Trumpkin went to a flat stone about the size of the top of awater-butt, and stamped on it with his foot. After a long pause it was moved away bysomeone or something underneath, and there was a dark, round hole with a good deal ofheat and steam coming out of it and in the middle of the hole the head of a Dwarf verylike Trumpkin himself. There was a long talk here and the dwarf seemed more suspiciousthan the Squirrel or the Bulgy Bears had been, but in the end the whole party were invitedto come down. Caspian found himself descending a dark stairway into the earth, butwhen he came to the bottom he saw firelight. It was the light of a furnace. The wholeplace was a smithy. A subterranean stream ran past on one side of it. Two Dwarfs were atthe bellows, another was holding a piece of red-hot metal on the anvil with a pair oftongs, a fourth was hammering it, and two, wiping their horny little hands on a greasycloth, were coming forward to meet the visitors. It took some time to satisfy them thatCaspian was a friend and not an enemy, but when they did, they all cried, "Long live theKing," and their gifts were noble - mail shirts and helmets and swords for Caspian andTrumpkin and Nikabrik. The Badger could have had the same if he had liked, but he saidhe was a beast, he was, and if his claws and teeth could not keep his skin whole, it wasn'tworth keeping. The workmanship of the arms was far finer than any Caspian had everseen, and he gladly accepted the Dwarf-made sword instead of his own, which looked, incomparison, as feeble as a toy and as clumsy as a stick. The seven brothers (who were allRed Dwarfs) promised to come to the feast at Dancing Lawn.

A little farther on, in a dry, rocky ravine they reached the cave of five Black Dwarfs.

They looked suspiciously at Caspian, but in the end the eldest of them said, "If he isagainst Miraz, we'll have him for King." And the next oldest said, "Shall we go farther upfor you, up to the crags? There's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce youto, up there."

"Certainly not," said Caspian.

"I should think not, indeed," said Trufflehunter. "We want none of that sort on our side."Nikabrik disagreed with this, but Trumpkin and the Badger overruled him. It gaveCaspian a shock to realize that the horrible creatures out of the old stories, as well as thenice ones, had some descendants in Narnia still.

"We should not have Aslan for friend if we brought in that rabble," said Trufflehunter asthey came away from the cave of the Black Dwarfs.

"Oh, Aslan!" said Trumpkin, cheerily but contemptuously. "What matters much more isthat you wouldn't have me."

"Do you believe in Aslan?" said Caspian to Nikabrik.

"I'll believe in anyone or anything," said Nikabrik, "that'll batter these cursed Telmarinebarbarians to pieces or drive them out of Narnia. Anyone or anything, Aslan or the WhiteWitch, do you understand?"

"Silence, silence," said Trufflehunter. "You do not know what you are saying. She was aworse enemy than Miraz and all his race."

"Not to Dwarfs, she wasn't," said Nikabrik.

Their next visit was a pleasanter one. As they came lower down, the mountains openedout into a great glen or wooded gorge with a swift river running at the bottom. The openplaces near the river's edge were a mass of foxgloves and wild roses and the air wasbuzzing with bees. Here Trufflehunter called again, "Glenstorm! Glenstorm!" and after apause Caspian heard the sound of hoofs. It grew louder till the valley trembled and at last,breaking and trampling the thickets, there came in sight the noblest creatures that Caspianhad yet seen, the great Centaur Glenstorm and his three sons. His flanks were glossychestnut and the beard that covered his broad chest was goldenred. He was a prophet anda star-gazer and knew what they had come about.

"Long live the King," he cried. "I and my sons are ready for war. When is the battle to bejoined?"

Up till now neither Caspian nor the others had really been thinking of a war. They hadsome vague idea, perhaps, of an occasional raid on some Human farmstead or ofattacking a party of hunters, if it ventured too far into these southern wilds. But, in themain, they had thought only of living to themselves in woods and caves and building upan attempt at Old Narnia in hiding. As soon as Glenstorm had spoken everyone felt muchmore serious.

"Do you mean a real war to drive Miraz out of Narnia?" asked Caspian.

"What else?" said the Centaur. "Why else does your Majesty go clad in mail and girt withsword?"

"Is it possible, Glenstorm?" said the Badger.

"The time is ripe," said Glenstorm. "I watch the skies, Badger, for it is mine to watch, asit is yours to remember. Tarva and Alambil have met in the halls of high heaven, and onearth a son of Adam has once more arisen to rule and name the creatures. The hour hasstruck. Our council at the Dancing Lawn must be a council of war." He spoke in such avoice that neither Caspian nor the others hesitated for a moment: it now seemed to themquite possible that they might win a war and quite certain that they must wage one.

As it was now past the middle of the day, they rested with the Centaurs and ate such foodas the centaurs provided cakes of oaten meal, and apples, and herbs, and wine, andcheese.

The next place they were to visit was quite near at hand, but they had to go a long wayround in order to avoid a region in which Men lived. It was well into the afternoon beforethey found themselves in level fields, warm between hedgerows. There Trufflehuntercalled at the mouth of a little hole in a green bank and out popped the last thing Caspianexpected - a Talking Mouse. He was of course bigger than a common mouse, well over afoot high when he stood on his hind legs, and with ears nearly as long as (though broaderthan) a rabbit's. His name was Reepicheep and he was a gay and martial mouse. He worea tiny little rapier at his side and twirled his long whiskers as if they were a moustache.

"There are twelve of us, Sire," he said with a dashing and graceful bow, "and I place allthe resources of my people unreservedly at your Majesty's disposal." Caspian tried hard(and successfully) not to laugh, but he couldn't help thinking that Reepicheep and all hispeople could very easily be put in a washing basket and carried home on one's back.

It would take too long to mention all the creatures whom Caspian met that day - ClodsleyShovel the Mole, the three Hardbiters (who were badgers like Trufflehunter), Camillo theHare, and Hogglestock the Hedgehog. They rested at last beside a well at the edge of awide and level circle of grass, bordered with tall elms which now threw long shadowsacross it, for the sun was setting, the daisies closing, and the rooks flying home to bed.

Here they supped on food they had brought with them and Trumpkin lit his pipe(Nikabrik was not a smoker).

"Now," said the Badger, "if only we could wake the spirits of these trees and this well, weshould have done a good day's work."

"Can't we?" said Caspian.

"No," said Trufflehunter. "We have no power over them. Since the Humans came into theland, felling forests and defiling streams, the Dryads and Naiads have sunk into a deepsleep. Who knows if ever they will stir again? And that is a great loss to our side. TheTelmarines are horribly afraid of the woods, and once the Trees moved in anger, ourenemies would go mad with fright and be chased out of Narnia as quick as their legscould carry them."

"What imaginations you Animals have!" said Trumpkin, who didn't believe in suchthings. "But why stop at Trees and Waters? Wouldn't it be even nicer if the stones startedthrowing themselves at old Miraz?"

The Badger only grunted at this, and after that there was such a silence that Caspian hadnearly dropped off to sleep when he thought he heard a faint musical sound from thedepth of the woods at his back. Then he thought it was only a dream and turned overagain; but as soon as his ear touched the ground he felt or heard (it was hard to tellwhich) a faint beating or drumming. He raised his head. The beating noise at once

became fainter, but the music returned, clearer this time. It was like flutes. He saw thatTrufflehunter was sitting up staring into the wood. The moon was bright; Caspian hadbeen asleep longer than he thought. Nearer and nearer came the music, a tune wild andyet dreamy, and the noise of many light feet, till at last, out from the wood into themoonlight, came dancing shapes such as Caspian had been thinking of all his life. Theywere not much taller than dwarfs, but far slighter and more graceful. Their curly headshad little horns, the upper part of their bodies gleamed naked in the pale light, but theirlegs and feet were those of goats.

"Fauns!" cried Caspian, jumping up, and in a moment they were all round him. It tooknext to no time to explain the whole situation to them and they accepted Caspian at once.

Before he knew what he was doing he found himself joining in the dance. Trumpkin,with heavier and jerkier movements, did likewise and even Trufflehunter hopped andlumbered about as best he could. Only Nikabrik stayed where he was, looking on insilence. The Fauns footed it all round Caspian to their reedy pipes. Their strange faces,which seemed mournful and merry all at once, looked into his; dozens of Fauns, Mentiusand Obentinus and Dumnus, Voluns, Voltinus, Girbius, Nimienus, Nausus, and Oscuns.

Pattertwig had sent them all.

When Caspian awoke next morning he could hardly believe that it had not all been adream; but the grass was covered with little cloven hoof-marks.
