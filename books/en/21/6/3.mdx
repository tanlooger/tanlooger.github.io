title: CHAPTER 3. THE WOOD BETWEEN THE WORLDS
---

UNCLE ANDREW and his study vanished instantly. Then, for a moment, everythingbecame muddled. The next thing Digory knew was that there was a soft green light

coming down on him from above, and darkness below. He didn't seem to be standing onanything, or sitting, or lying. Nothing appeared to be touching him. "I believe I'm inwater," said Digory. "Or under water." This frightened him for a second, but almost atonce he could feel that he was rushing upwards. Then his head suddenly came out intothe air and, he found himself scrambling ashore, out on to smooth grassy ground at theedge of a pool.

As he rose to his feet he noticed that he was neither dripping nor panting for breath asanyone would expect after being under water. His clothes were perfectly dry. He wasstanding by the edge of a small pool - not more than ten feet from side to side in a wood.

The trees grew close together and were so leafy that he could get no glimpse of the sky.

All the light was green light that came through the leaves: but there must have been avery strong sun overhead, for this green daylight was bright and warm. It was the quietestwood you could possibly imagine. There were no birds, no insects, no animals, and nowind. You could almost feel the trees growing. The pool he had just got out of was notthe only pool. There were dozens of others - a pool every few yards as far as his eyescould reach. You could almost feel the trees drinking the water up with their roots. Thiswood was very much alive. When he tried to describe it afterwards

Digory always said, "It was a rich place: as rich as plumcake."

The strangest thing was that, almost before he had looked about him, Digory had halfforgotten how he had come there. At any rate, he was certainly not thinking about Polly,or Uncle Andrew, or even his Mother. He was not in the least frightened, or excited, orcurious. If anyone had asked him "Where did you come from?" he would probably havesaid, "I've always been here." That was what it felt like - as if one had always been in thatplace and never been bored although nothing had ever happened. As he said longafterwards, "It's not the sort of place where things happen. The trees go on growing, that'sall."

After Digory had looked at the wood for a long time he noticed that there was a girl lyingon her back at the foot of a tree a few yards away. Her eyes were nearly shut but notquite, as if she were just between sleeping and waking. So he looked at her for a longtime and said nothing. And at last she opened her eyes and looked at him for a long timeand she also said nothing. Then she spoke, in a dreamy, contented sort of voice.

"I think I've seen you before," she said.

"I rather think so too," said Digory. "Have you been here long?"

"Oh, always," said the girl. "At least - I don't know a very long time."

"So have I," said Digory.

"No you haven't, said she. "I've just seen you come up out of that pool."

"Yes, I suppose I did," said Digory with a puzzled air, "I'd forgotten."

Then for quite a long time neither said any more.

"Look here," said the girl presently, "I wonder did we ever really meet before? I had asort of idea - a sort of picture in my head - of a boy and a girl, like us - living somewherequite different - and doing all sorts of things. Perhaps it was only a dream."

"I've had that same dream, I think," said Digory. "About a boy and a girl, living next door- and something about crawling among rafters. I remember the girl had a dirty face."

"Aren't you getting it mixed? In my dream it was the boy who had the dirty face."

"I can't remember the boy's face," said Digory: and then added, "Hullo! What's that?"

"Why! it's a guinea-pig," said the girl. And it was - a fat guinea-pig, nosing about in thegrass. But round the middle of the guinea-pig there ran a tape, and, tied on to it by thetape, was a bright yellow ring.

"Look! look," cried Digory, "The ring! And look! You've got one on your finger. And sohave I."

The girl now sat up, really interested at last. They stared very hard at one another, tryingto remember. And then, at exactly the same moment, she shouted out "Mr Ketterley" andhe shouted out "Uncle Andrew", and they knew who they were and began to rememberthe whole story. After a few minutes hard talking they had got it straight. Digoryexplained how beastly Uncle Andrew had been.

"What do we do now?" said Polly. "Take the guineapig and go home?"

"There's no hurry," said Digory with a huge yawn.

"I think there is," said Polly. "This place is too quiet. It's so - so dreamy. You're almostasleep. If we once give in to it we shall just lie down and drowse for ever and ever."

"It's very nice here," said Digory.

"Yes, it is," said Polly.

"But we've got to get back." She stood up and began to go cautiously towards the guinea-

pig. But then she changed her mind.

"We might as well leave the guinea-pig," she said. "It's perfectly happy here, and youruncle will only do something horrid to it if we take it home."

"I bet he would," answered Digory. "Look at the way he's treated us. By the way, how dowe get home?"

"Go back into the pool, I expect."

They came and stood together at the edge looking down into the smooth water. It was fullof the reflection of the green, leafy branches; they made it look very deep.

"We haven't any bathing things," said Polly.

"We shan't need them, silly," said Digory. "We're going in with our clothes on. Don't youremember it didn't wet us on the way up?"

"Can you swim?"

"A bit. Can you?"

"Well - not much."

"I don't think we shall need to swim," said Digory "We want to go down, don't we?"

Neither of them much liked the idea of jumping into that pool, but neither said so to theother. They took hands and said "One - Two - Three - Go" and jumped. There was a greatsplash and of course they closed their eyes. But when they opened them again they foundthey were still standing, hand in hand, in the green wood, and hardly up to their ankles inwater. The pool was apparently only a couple of inches deep. They splashed back on tothe dry ground.

"What on earth's gone wrong?" said Polly in a frightened voice; but not quite sofrightened as you might expect, because it is hard to feel really frightened in that wood.

The place is too peaceful.

"Oh! I know," said Digory, "Of course it won't work. We're still wearing our yellowrings. They're for the outward journey, you know. The green ones take you home. Wemust change rings. Have you got pockets? Good. Put your yellow ring in your left. I'vegot two greens. Here's one for you."

They put on their green rings and came back to the pool. But before they tried anotherjump Digory gave a long "O-ooh!"

"What's the matter?" said Polly.

"I've just had a really wonderful idea," said Digory. "What are all the other pools?"

"How do you mean?"

"Why, if awe can get back to our own world by jumping into this pool, mightn't we getsomewhere else by jumping into one of the others? Supposing there was a world at thebottom of every pool."

"But I thought we were already in your Uncle Andrew's Other World or Other Place orwhatever he called it. Didn't you say -"

"Oh bother Uncle Andrew," interrupted Digory. "I don't believe he knows anything aboutit. He never had the pluck to come here himself. He only talked of one Other World. Butsuppose there were dozens?"

"You mean, this wood might be only one of them?"

"No, I don't believe this wood is a world at all. I think it's just a sort of in-between place."

Polly looked puzzled. "Don't you see?" said Digory. "No, do listen. Think of our tunnelunder the slates at home. It isn't a room in any of the houses. In a way, it isn't really partof any of the houses. But once you're in the tunnel you can go along it and come into anyof the houses in the row. Mightn't this wood be the same? - a place that isn't in any of theworlds, but once you've found that place you can get into them all."

"Well, even if you can -" began Polly, but Digory went on as if he hadn't heard her.

"And of course that explains everything," he said. "That's why it is so quiet and sleepyhere. Nothing ever happens here. Like at home. It's in the houses that people talk, and dothings, and have meals. Nothing goes on in the inbetween places, behind the walls andabove the ceilings and under the floor, or in our own tunnel. But when you come out ofour tunnel you may find yourself in any house. I think we can get out of this place intojolly well Anywhere! We don't need to jump back into the same pool we came up by. Ornot just yet."

"The Wood between the Worlds," said Polly dreamily. "It sounds rather nice."

"Come on," said Digory. "Which pool shall we try?"

"Look here," said Polly, "I'm not going to try any new pool till we've made sure that wecan get back by the old one. We're not even sure if it'll work yet."

"Yes," said Digory. "And get caught by Uncle Andrew and have our rings taken awaybefore we've had any fun. No thanks."

"Couldn't we just go part of the way down into our own pool," said Polly. "Just to see if itworks. Then if it does, we'll change rings and come up again before we're really back inMr Ketterley's study."

"Can we go part of the way down?"

"Well, it took time coming up. I suppose it'll take a little time going back."

Digory made rather a fuss about agreeing to this, but he had to in the end because Pollyabsolutely refused to do any exploring in new worlds until she had made sure aboutgetting back to the old one. She was quite as brave as he about some dangers (wasps, forinstance) but she was not so interested in finding out things nobody had ever heard ofbefore; for Digory was the sort of person who wants to know everything, and when hegrew up he became the famous Professor Kirke who comes into other books.

After a good deal of arguing they agreed to put on their green rings ("Green for safety,"said Digory, "so you can't help remembering which is which") and hold hands and jump.

But as soon as they seemed to be getting back to Uncle Andrew's study, or even to theirown world, Polly was to shout "Change" and they would slip off their greens and put ontheir yellows. Digory wanted to be the one who shouted "Change" but Polly wouldn'tagree.

They put on the green rings, took hands, and once more shouted "One -Two - Three -

Go". This time it worked. It is very hard to tell you what it felt like, for everythinghappened so quickly. At first there were bright lights moving about in a black sky;Digory always thinks these were stars and even swears that he saw Jupiter quite close -

close enough to see its moon. But almost at once there were rows and rows of roofs andchimney pots about them, and they could see St Paul's and knew they were looking atLondon. But you could see through the walls of all the houses. Then they could see UncleAndrew, very vague and shadowy, but getting clearer and more solid-looking all the time,just as if he were coming into focus. But before he became quite real Polly shouted"Change", and they did change, and our world faded away like a dream, and the greenlight above grew stronger and stronger, till their heads came out of the pool and theyscrambled ashore. And there was the wood all about them, as green and bright and still asever. The whole thing had taken less than a minute.

"There!" said Digory. "That's alright. Now for the adventure. Any pool will do. Come on.

Let's try that one."

"Stop!" said Polly- "Aren't we going to mark this pool?"

They stared at each other and turned quite white as they realized the dreadful thing thatDigory had just been going to do. For there were any number of pools in the wood, andthe pools were all alike and the trees were all alike, so that if they had once left behindthe pool that led to our own world without making some sort of landmark, the chanceswould have been a hundred to one against their ever finding it again.

Digory's hand was shaking as he opened his penknife and cut out a long strip of turf onthe bank of the pool. The soil (which smelled nice) was of a rich reddish brown andshowed up well against the green. "It's a good thing one of us has some sense," saidPolly.

"Well don't keep on gassing about it," said Digory. "Come along, I want to see what's inone of the other pools." And Polly gave him a pretty sharp answer and he said somethingeven nastier in reply. The quarrel lasted for several minutes but it would be dull to write itall down. Let us skip on to the moment at which they stood with beating hearts and ratherscared faces on the edge of the unknown pool with their yellow rings on and held handsand once more said "One - Two - Three - Go!"

Splash! Once again it hadn't worked. This pool, too, appeared to be only a puddle. Insteadof reaching a new world they only got their feet wet and splashed their legs for thesecond time that morning (if it was a morning: it seems to be always the same time in theWood between the Worlds).

"Blast and botheration!" exclaimed Digory. "What's gone wrong now? We've put ouryellow rings on all right. He said yellow for the outward journey."

Now the truth was that Uncle Andrew, who knew nothing about the Wood between theWorlds, had quite a wrong idea about the rings. The yellow ones weren't "outward" ringsand the green ones weren't "homeward" rings; at least, not in the way he thought. Thestuff of which both were made had all come from the wood. The stuff in the yellow ringshad the power of drawing you into the wood; it was stuff that wanted to get back to itsown place, the in-between place. But the stuff in the green rings is stuff that is trying toget out of its own place: so that a green ring would take you out of the wood into a world.

Uncle Andrew, you see, was working with things he did not really understand; mostmagicians are. Of course Digory did not realize the truth quite clearly either, or not tilllater. But when they had talked it over, they decided to try their green rings on the newpool, just to see what happened.

"I'm game if you are," said Polly. But she really said this because, in her heart of hearts,she now felt sure that neither kind of ring was going to work at all in the new pool, and sothere was nothing worse to be afraid of than another splash. I am not quite sure thatDigory had not the same feeling. At any rate, when they had both put on their greens andcome back to the edge of the water, and taken hands again, they were certainly a gooddeal more cheerful and less solemn than they had been the first time.

"One - Two - Three - Go!" said Digory. And they jumped.
