title: CHAPTER 7. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FRONT DOOR
---

"Now; slave, how long am I to wait for my chariot?" thundered the Witch. Uncle Andrewcowered away from her. Now that she was really present, all the silly thoughts he had hadwhile looking at himself in the glass were oozing out of him. But Aunt Letty at once gotup from her knees and came over to the centre of the room.

"And who is this young person, Andrew, may I ask?" said Aunt Letty in icy tones.

"Distinguished foreigner - v-very important p-person," he stammered.

"Rubbish!" said Aunt Letty, and then, turning to the Witch, "Get out of my house thismoment, you shameless hussy, or I'll send for the police." She thought the Witch must besomeone out of a circus and she did not approve of bare arms.

"What woman is this?" said Jadis. "Down on your knees, minion, before I blast you."

"No strong language in this house if you please, young woman," said Aunt Letty.

Instantly, as it seemed to Uncle Andrew, the Queen towered up to an even greater height.

Fire flashed from her eyes: she flung out her arm with the same gesture and the samehorrible-sounding words that had lately turned the palacegates of Charn to dust. Butnothing happened except that Aunt Letty, thinking that those horrible words were meantto be ordinary English, said:

"I thought as much. The woman is drunk. Drunk! She can't even speak clearly."

It must have been a terrible moment for the Witch when she suddenly realized that herpower of turning people into dust, which had been quite real in her own world, was notgoing to work in ours. But she did not lose her nerve even for a second. Without wastinga thought on her disappointment, she lunged forward, caught Aunt Letty round the neckand the knees, raised her high above her head as if she had been no heavier than a doll,and threw her across the room. While Aunt Letty was still hurtling through the air, thehousemaid (who was having a beautifully exciting morning) put her head in at the doorand said, "If you please, sir, the 'ansom's come."

"Lead on, Slave," said the Witch to Uncle Andrew. He began muttering something about"regrettable violence must really protest", but at a single glance from Jadis he becamespeechless. She drove him out of the room and out of the house; and Digory camerunning down the stairs just in time to see the front door close behind them.

"Jiminy!" he said. "She's loose in London. And with Uncle Andrew. I wonder what onearth is going to happen now."

"Oh, Master Digory," said the housemaid (who was really having a wonderful day), "Ithink Miss Ketterley's hurt herself somehow." So they both rushed into the drawing-roomto find out what had happened.

If Aunt Letty had fallen on bare boards or even on the carpet, I suppose all her boneswould have been broken: but by great good luck she had fallen on the mattress. AuntLetty was a very tough old lady: aunts often were in those days. After she had had somesal volatile and sat still for a few minutes, she said there was nothing the matter with herexcept a few bruises. Very soon she was taking charge of the situation.

"Sarah," she said to the housemaid (who had never had such a day before), "go around tothe police station at once and tell them there is a dangerous lunatic at large. I will takeMrs Kirke's lunch up myself." Mrs Kirke was, of course, Digory's mother.

When Mother's lunch had been seen to, Digory and Aunt Letty had their own. After thathe did some hard thinking.

The problem was how to get the Witch back to her own world, or at any rate out of ours,as soon as possible. Whatever happened, she must not be allowed to go rampaging aboutthe house. Mother must not see her.

And, if possible, she must not be allowed to go rampaging about London either. Digoryhad not been in the drawingroom when she tried to "blast" Aunt Letty, but he had seenher "blast" the gates at Charn: so he knew her terrible powers and did not know that shehad lost any of them by coming into our world. And he knew she meant to conquer ourworld. At the present moment, as far as he could see, she might be blasting BuckinghamPalace or the Houses of Parliament: and it was almost certain that quite a number ofpolicemen had by now been reduced to little heaps of dust. And there didn't seem to beanything he could do about that. "But the rings seem to work like magnets," thoughtDigory. "If I can only touch her and then slip on my yellow, we shall both go into theWood between the Worlds. I wonder will she go all faint again there? Was thatsomething the place does to her, or was it only the shock of being pulled out of her ownworld? But I suppose I'll have to risk that. And how am I to find the beast? I don'tsuppose Aunt Letty would let me go out, not unless I said where I was going. And Ihaven't got more than twopence. I'd need any amount of money for buses and trams if Iwent looking all over London. Anyway, I haven't the faintest idea where to look. Iwonder if Uncle Andrew is still with her."

It seemed in the end that the only thing he could do was to wait and hope that UncleAndrew and the Witch would come back. If they did, he must rush out and get hold of theWitch and put on his yellow Ring before she had a chance to get into the house. Thismeant that he must watch the front door like a cat watching a mouse's hole; he dared notleave his post for a moment. So he went into the dining-room and "glued his face" as theysay, to the window. It was a bow-window from which you could see the steps up to thefront door and see up and down the street, so that no one could reach the front doorwithout your knowing. "I wonder what Polly's doing?" thought Digory.

He wondered about this a good deal as the first slow half-hour ticked on. But you neednot wonder, for I am going to tell you. She had got home late for her dinner, with hershoes and stockings very wet. And when they asked her where she had been and what onearth she had been doing, she said she had been out with Digory Kirke. Under furtherquestioning she said she had got her feet wet in a pool of water, and that the pool was in awood. Asked where the wood was, she said she didn't know. Asked if it was in one of theparks, she said truthfully enough that she supposed it might be a sort of park. From all ofthis Polly's mother got the idea that Polly had gone off, without telling anyone, to somepart of London she didn't know, and gone into a strange park and amused herself jumpinginto puddles. As a result she was told that she had been very naughty indeed and that shewouldn't be allowed to play with "that Kirke boy" any more if anything of the sort everhappened again. Then she was given dinner with all the nice parts left out and sent to bedfor two solid hours. It was a thing that happened to one quite often in those days.

So while Digory was staring out of the dining-room window, Polly was lying in bed, andboth were thinking how terribly slowly the time could go. I think, myself, I would ratherhave been in Polly's position. She had only to wait for the end of her two hours: but everyfew minutes Digory would hear a cab or a baker's van or a butcher's boy coming roundthe corner and think "Here she comes", and then find it wasn't. And in between these

false alarms, for what seemed hours and hours, the clock ticked on and one big fly - highup and far out of reach buzzed against the window. It was one of those houses that getvery quiet and dull in the afternoon and always seem to smell of mutton.

During his long watching and waiting one small thing happened which I shall have tomention because something important came of it later on. A lady called with some grapesfor Digory's Mother; and as the dining-room door was open, Digory couldn't helpoverhearing Aunt Letty and the lady as they talked in the hall.

"What lovely grapes!" came Aunt Letty's voice. "I'm sure if anything could do her goodthese would. But poor, dear little Mabel! I'm afraid it would need fruit from the land ofyouth to help her now. Nothing in this world will do much." Then they both lowered theirvoices and said a lot more that he could not hear.

If he had heard that bit about the land of youth a few days ago he would have thoughtAunt Letty was just talking without meaning anything in particular, the way grown-upsdo, and it wouldn't have interested him. He almost thought so now. But suddenly itflashed upon his mind that he now knew (even if Aunt Letty didn't) that there really wereother worlds and that he himself had been in one of them. At that rate there might be areal Land of Youth somewhere. There might be almost anything. There might be fruit insome other world that would really cure his mother! And oh, oh - Well, you know how itfeels if you begin hoping for something that you want desperately badly; you almost fightagainst the hope because it is too good to be true; you've been disappointed so oftenbefore. That was how Digory felt. But it was no good trying to throttle this hope. It mightreally, really, it just might be true. So many odd things had happened already. And he hadthe magic rings. There must be worlds you could get to through every pool in the wood.

He could hunt through them all. And then Mother well again. Everything right again. Heforgot all about watching for the Witch. His hand was already going into the pocketwhere he kept the yellow ring, when all at once he herd a sound of galloping.

"Hullo! What's that?" thought Digory. "Fire-engine? I wonder what house is on fire.

Great Scott, it's coming here. Why, it's Her."

I needn't tell you who he meant by Her.

First came the hansom. There was no one in the driver's seat. On the roof - not sitting, butstanding on the roof swaying with superb balance as it came at full speed round thecorner with one wheel in the air - was Jadis the Queen of Queens and the Terror ofCharn. Her teeth were bared, her eyes shone like fire, and her long hair streamed outbehind her like a comet's tail. She was flogging the horse without mercy. Its nostrils werewide and red and its sides were spotted with foam. It galloped madly up to the front door,missing the lamp-post by an inch, and then reared up on its hind legs. The hansomcrashed into the lamp-post and shattered into several pieces. The Witch, with amagnificent jump, had sprung clear just in time and landed on the horse's back. Shesettled herself astride and leaned forward, whispering things in its ear. They must havebeen things meant not to quiet it but to madden it. It was on its hind legs again in a

moment, and its neigh was like a scream; it was all hoofs and teeth and eyes and tossingmane. Only a splendid rider could have stayed on its back.

Before Digory had recovered his breath a good many other things began to happen. Asecond hansom dashed up close behind the first: out of it there jumped a fat man in afrock-coat and a policeman. Then came a third hansom with two more policemen in it.

After it, came about twenty people (mostly errand boys) on bicycles, all ringing theirbells and letting out cheers and cat-calls. Last of all came a crowd of people on foot: allvery hot with running, but obviously enjoying themselves. Windows shot up in all thehouses of that street and a housemaid or a butler appeared at every front door. Theywanted to see the fun.

Meanwhile an old gentleman had begun to struggle shakily out of the ruins of the firsthansom. Several people rushed forward to help him; but as one pulled him one way andanother another, perhaps he would have got out quite as quickly on his own. Digoryguessed that the old gentleman must be Uncle Andrew but you couldn't see his face; histall hat had been bashed down over it.

Digory rushed out and joined the crowd.

"That's the woman, that's the woman," cried the fat man, pointing at Jadis. "Do your duty,Constable. Hundreds and thousands of pounds' worth she's taken out of my shop. Look atthat rope of pearls round her neck. That's mine. And she's given me a black eye too,what's more."

"That she 'as, guv'nor," said one of the crowd. "And as lovely a black eye as I'd wish tosee. Beautiful bit of work that must 'ave been. Gor! ain't she strong then!"

"You ought to put a nice raw beefsteak on it, Mister, that's what it wants," said a butcher'sboy.

"Now then," said the most important of the policemen, "what's all this 'ere?"

"I tell you she -" began the fat man, when someone else called out:

"Don't let the old cove in the cab get away. 'E put 'er up to it."

The old gentleman, who was certainly Uncle Andrew, had just succeeded in standing upand was rubbing his bruises. "Now then," said the policeman, turning to him, "What's allthis?"

"Womfle - pomfy - shomf," came Uncle Andrew's voice from inside the hat.

"None of that now," said the policeman sternly. "You'll find this is no laughing matter.

Take that 'at off, see?"

This was more easily said than done. But after Uncle Andrew had struggled in vain withthe hat for some time, two other policemen seized it by the brim and forced it off.

"Thank you, thank you," said Uncle Andrew in a faint voice. "Thank you. Dear me, I'mterribly shaken. If someone could give me a small glass of brandy -"

"Now you attend to me, if you please," said the policeman, taking out a very large notebook and a very small pencil. "Are you in charge of that there young woman?"

"Look out!" called several voices, and the policeman jumped a step backwards just intime. The horse had aimed a kick at him which would probably have killed him. Then theWitch wheeled the horse round so that she faced the crowd and its hind-legs were on thefootpath. She had a long, bright knife in her hand and had been busily cutting the horsefree from the wreck of the hansom.

All this time Digory had been trying to get into a position from which he could touch theWitch. This wasn't at all easy because, on the side nearest to him, there were too manypeople. And in order to get round to the other side he had to pass between the horse'shoofs and the railings of the "area" that surrounded the house; for the Ketterleys' househad a basement. If you know anything about horses, and especially if you had seen what astate that horse was in at the moment, you will realize that this was a ticklish thing to do.

Digory knew lots about horses, but he set his teeth and got ready to make a dash for it assoon as he saw a favourable moment.

A red-faced man in a bowler hat had now shouldered his way to the front of the crowd.

"Hi! P'leeceman," he said, "that's my 'orse what she's sitting on, same as it's my cab whatshe's made matchwood of."

"One at a time, please, one at a time," said the policeman.

"But there ain't no time," said the Cabby. "I know that 'orse better'n you do. 'Tain't anordinary 'orse. 'Is father was a hofficer's charger in the cavalry, 'e was. And if the youngwoman goes on hexcitin' 'im, there'll be murder done. 'Ere, let me get at him."

The policeman was only to glad to have a good reason for standing further away from thehorse. The Cabby took a step nearer, looked up at Jadis, and said in a not unkindly voice:

"Now, Missie, let me get at 'is 'ead, and just you get off. You're a Lidy, and you don'twant all these roughs going for you, do you? You want to go 'ome and 'ave a nice cup oftea and a lay down quiet like; then you'll feel ever so much better." At the same time hestretched out his hand towards the horse's head with the words, "Steady, Strawberry, oldboy. Steady now."

Then for the first time the Witch spoke.

"Dog!" came her cold, clear voice, ringing loud above all the other noises. "Dog, unhandour royal charger. We are the Empress Jadis."
