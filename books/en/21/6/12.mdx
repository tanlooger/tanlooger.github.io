title: CHAPTER 12. STRAWBERRY'S ADVENTURE
---

DIGORY kept his mouth very tight shut. He had been growing more and moreuncomfortable. He hoped that, whatever happened, he wouldn't blub or do anythingridiculous.

"Son of Adam," said Aslan. "Are you ready to undo the wrong that you have done to mysweet country of Narnia on the very day of its birth?"

"Well, I don't see what I can do," said Digory. "You see, the Queen ran away and -"

"I asked, are you ready?" said the Lion.

"Yes," said Digory. He had had for a second some wild idea of saying "I'll try to help youif you'll promise to help my Mother," but he realized in time that the Lion was not at allthe sort of person one could try to make bargains with. But when he had said "Yes," hethought of his Mother, and he thought of the great hopes he had had, and how they wereall dying away, and a lump came in his throat and tears in his eyes, and he blurted out:

"But please, please - won't you - can't you give me something that will cure Mother?" Uptill then he had been looking at the Lion's great feet and the huge claws on them; now, inhis despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything inhis whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders)great shining tears stood in the Lion's eyes. They were such big, bright tears comparedwith Digory's own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about hisMother than he was himself.

"My son, my son," said Aslan. "I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land knowthat yet. Let us be good to one another. But I have to think of hundreds of years in the lifeof Narnia. The Witch whom you have brought into this world will come back to Narniaagain. But it need not be yet. It is my wish to plant in Narnia a tree that she will not dareto approach, and that tree will protect Narnia from her for many years. So this land shallhave a long, bright morning before any clouds come over the sun. You must get me theseed from which that tree is to grow."

"Yes, sir," said Digory. He didn't know how it was to be done but he felt quite sure nowthat he would be able to do it. The Lion drew a deep breath, stooped its head even lowerand gave him a Lion's kiss. And at once Digory felt that new strength and courage hadgone into him.

"Dear son," said Aslan, "I will tell you what you must do. Turn and look to the West andtell me what do you see?"

"I see terribly big mountains, Aslan," said Digory, "I see this river coming down cliffs ina waterfall. And beyond the cliff there are high green hills with forests. And beyond thosethere are higher ranges that look almost black. And then, far away, there are big snowymountains all heaped up together - like pictures of the Alps. And behind those there'snothing but the sky."

"You see well," said the Lion. "Now the land of Narnia ends where the waterfall comesdown, and once you have reached the top of the cliffs you will be out of Narnia and intothe Western Wild. You must journey through those mountains till you find a green valleywith a blue lake in it, walled round by mountains of ice. At the end of the lake there is asteep, green hill. On the top of that hill there is a garden. In the centre of that garden is atree. Pluck an apple from that tree and bring it back to me."

"Yes, sir," said Digory again. He hadn't the least idea of how he was to climb the cliff andfind his way among all the mountains, but he didn't like to say that for fear it would

sound like making excuses. But he did say, "I hope, Aslan, you're not in a hurry. I shan'tbe able to get there and back very quickly."

"Little son of Adam, you shall have help," said Aslan. He then turned to the Horse whohad been standing quietly beside them all this time, swishing his tail to keep the flies off,and listening with his head on one side as if the conversation were a little difficult tounderstand.

"My dear," said Aslan to the Horse, "would you like to be a winged horse?"

You should have seen how the Horse shook its mane and how its nostrils widened, andthe little tap it gave the ground with one back hoof. Clearly it would very much like to bea winged horse. But it only said:

"If you wish, Aslan - if you really mean - I don't know why it should be me - I'm not avery clever horse."

"Be winged. Be the father of all flying horses," roared Aslan in a voice that shook theground. "Your name is Fledge."

The horse shied, just as it might have shied in the old, miserable days when it pulled ahansom. Then it roared. It strained its neck back as if there were a fly biting its shouldersand it wanted to scratch them. And then, just as the beasts had burst out of the earth, thereburst out from the shoulders of Fledge wings that spread and grew, larger than eagles',larger than swans', larger than angels' wings in church windows. The feathers shonechestnut colour and copper colour. He gave a great sweep with them and leaped into theair.

Twenty feet above Aslan and Digory he snorted, neighed, and curvetted. Then, aftercircling once round them, he dropped to the earth, all four hoofs together, lookingawkward and surprised, but extremely pleased.

"Is it good, Fledge?" said Aslan.

"It is very good, Aslan," said Fledge.

"Will you carry this little son of Adam on your back to the mountainvalley I spoke of?"

"What? Now? At once?" said Strawberry - or Fledge, as we must now call him - "Hurrah!

Come, little one, I've had things like you on my back before.

Long, long ago. When there were green fields; and sugar."

"What are the two daughters of Eve whispering about?" said Aslan, turning verysuddenly on Polly and the Cabby's wife, who had in fact been making friends.

"If you please, sir," said Queen Helen (for that is what Nellie the cabman's wife nowwas), "I think the little girl would love to go too, if it weren't no trouble."

"What does Fledge say about that?" asked the Lion.

"Oh, I don't mind two, not when they're little ones," said Fledge. "But I hope the Elephantdoesn't want to come as well."

The Elephant had no such wish, and the new King of Narnia helped both the children up:that is, he gave Digory a rough heave and set Polly as gently and daintily on the horse'sback as if she were made of china and might break. "There they are, Strawberry - Fledge,I should say. This is a rum go."

"Do not fly too high," said Aslan. "Do not try to go over the tops of the great ice-

mountains. Look out for the valleys, the green places, and fly through them. There willalways be a way through. And now, begone with my blessing."

"Oh Fledge!" said Digory, leaning forward to pat the Horse's glossy neck. "This is fun.

Hold on to me tight, Polly."

Next moment the country dropped away beneath them, and whirled round as Fledge, likea huge pigeon, circled once or twice before setting off on his long westward flight.

Looking down, Polly could hardly see the King and the Queen, and even Aslan himselfwas only a bright yellow spot on the green grass. Soon the wind was in their faces andFledges wings settled down to a steady beat.

All Narnia, many-coloured with lawns and rocks and heather and different sorts of trees,lay spread out below them, the river winding through it like a ribbon of quicksilver. Theycould already see over the tops of the low hills which lay northward on their right;beyond those hills a great moorland sloped gently up and up to the horizon. On their leftthe mountains were much higher, but every now and then there was a gap when youcould see, between steep pine woods, a glimpse of the southern lands that lay beyondthem, looking blue and far away.

"That'll be where Archenland is," said Polly.

"Yes, but look ahead!" said Digory.

For now a great barrier of cliffs rose before them and they were almost dazzled by thesunlight dancing on the great waterfall by which the river roars and sparkles down intoNarnia itself from the high western lands in which it rises. They were flying so highalready that the thunder of those falls could only just be heard as a small, thin sound, butthey were not yet high enough to fly over the top of the cliffs.

"We'll have to do a bit of zig-zagging here," said Fledge. "Hold on tight."

He began flying to and fro, getting higher at each turn. The air grew colder, and theyheard the call of eagles far below them.

"I say, look back! Look behind," said Polly.

There they could see the whole valley of Narnia stretched out to where, just before theeastern horizon, there was a gleam of the sea. And now they were so high that they couldsee tiny-looking jagged mountains appearing beyond the northwest moors, and plains ofwhat looked like sand far in the south.

"I wish we had someone to tell us what all those places are," said Digory.

"I don't suppose they're anywhere yet," said Polly. "I mean, there's no one there, andnothing happening. The world only began today."

"No, but people will get there," said Digory. "And then they'll have histories, you know."

"Well, it's a jolly good thing they haven't now," said Polly. "Because nobody can be madeto learn it. Battles and dates and all that rot."

Now they were over the top of the cliffs and in a few minutes the valley land of Narniahad sunk out of sight behind them. They were flying over a wild country of steep hillsand dark forests, still following the course of the river. The really big mountains loomedahead. But the sun was now in the travellers' eyes and they couldn't see things veryclearly in that direction. For the sun sank lower and lower till the western sky was all likeone great furnace full of melted gold; and it set at last behind a jagged peak which stoodup against the brightness as sharp and flat as if it were cut out of cardboard.

"It's none too warm up here," said Polly.

"And my wings are beginning to ache," said Fledge. There's no sign of the valley with aLake in it, like what Aslan said. What about coming down and looking out for a decentspot to spend the night in? We shan't reach that place tonight."

"Yes, and surely it's about time for supper?" said Digory.

So Fledge came lower and lower. As they came down nearer to the earth and among thehills, the air grew warmer and after travelling so many hours with nothing to listen to butthe beat of Fledge's wings, it was nice to hear the homely and earthy noises again - thechatter of the river on its stony bed and the creaking of trees in the light wind. A warm,good smell of sun-baked earth and grass and flowers came up to them. At last Fledgealighted. Digory rolled off and helped Polly to dismount. Both were glad to stretch theirstiff legs.

The valley in which they had come down was in the heart of the mountains; snowyheights, one of them looking rosered in the reflections of the sunset, towered above them.

"I am hungry," said Digory.

"Well, tuck in," said Fledge, taking a big mouthful of grass. Then he raised his head, stillchewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers, andsaid, "Come on, you two. Don't be shy. There's plenty for us all."

"But we can't eat grass," said Digory.

"H'm, h'm," said Fledge, speaking with his mouth full. "Well - h'm - don't know quitewhat you'll do then. Very good grass too."

Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay.

"Well, I do think someone might have arranged about our meals," said Digory.

"I'm sure Aslan would have, if you'd asked him," said Fledge.

"Wouldn't he know without being asked?" said Polly.

"I've no doubt he would," said the Horse (still with his mouth full). "But I've a sort ofidea he likes to be asked."

"But what on earth are we to do?" asked Digory.

"I'm sure I don't know," said Fledge. "Unless you try the grass. You might like it betterthan you think."

"Oh, don't be silly," said Polly, stamping her foot. "Of course humans can't eat grass, anymore than you could eat a mutton chop."

"For goodness' sake don't talk about chops and things," said Digory. "It only makes itworse."

Digory said that Polly had better take herself home by ring and get something to eatthere; he couldn't himself because he had promised to go straight on his message forAslan, and, if once he showed up again at home, anything might happen to prevent hisgetting back. But Polly said she wouldn't leave him, and Digory said it was jolly decentof her.

"I say," said Polly, "I've still got the remains of that bag of toffee in my jacket. It'll bebetter than nothing."

"A lot better," said Digory, "But be careful to get your hand into your pocket withouttouching your ring."

This was a difficult and delicate job but they managed it in the end. The little paper bagwas very squashy and sticky when they finally got it out, so that it was more a question oftearing the bag off the toffees than of getting the toffees out of the bag. Some grown-ups(you know how fussy they can be about that sort of thing) would rather have gonewithout supper altogether than eaten those toffees. There were nine of them all told. Itwas Digory who had the bright idea of eating four each and planting the ninth; for, as hesaid, "if the bar off the lamp-post turned into a little light-tree, why shouldn't this turninto a toffee-tree?" So they dibbled a small hole in the turf and buried the piece of toffee.

Then they ate the other pieces, making them last as long as they could. It was a poormeal, even with all the paper they couldn't help eating as well.

When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down. The childrencame and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body, and when he hadspread a wing over each they were really quite snug. As the bright young stars of thatnew world came out they talked over everything: how Digory had hoped to get somethingfor his Mother and how, instead of that, he had been sent on this message. And theyrepeated to one another all the signs by which they would know the places they werelooking for - the blue lake and the hill with a garden on top of it. The talk was justbeginning to slow down as they got sleepy, when suddenly Polly sat up wide awake andsaid "Hush!"

Everyone listened as hard as they could.

"Perhaps it was only the wind in the trees," said Digory presently.

"I'm not so sure," said Fledge. "Anyway - wait! There it goes again. By Aslan, it issomething."

The horse scrambled to its feet with a great noise and a great upheaval; the children werealready on theirs. Fledge trotted to and fro, sniffing and whinnying. The children tip-toedthis way and that, looking behind every bush and tree. They kept on thinking they sawthings, and there was one time when Polly was perfectly certain she had seen-a tall, darkfigure gliding quickly away in a westerly direction. But they caught nothing and in theend Fledge lay down again and the children re-snuggled (if that is the right word) underhis wings. They went to sleep at once. Fledge stayed awake much longer moving his earsto and fro in the darkness and sometimes giving a little shiver with his skin as if a fly hadlighted on him: but in the end he too slept.
