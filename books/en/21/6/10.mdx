title: CHAPTER 10. THE FIRST JOKE AND OTHER MATTERS
---

IT was of course the Lion's voice. The children had long felt sure that he could speak: yetit was a lovely and terrible shock when he did.

Out of the trees wild people stepped forth, gods and goddesses of the wood; with themcame Fauns and Satyrs and Dwarfs. Out of the river rose the river god with his Naiaddaughters. And all these and all the beasts and birds in their different voices, low or highor thick or clear, replied:

"Hail, Aslan. We hear and obey. We are awake. We love. We think. We speak. Weknow."

"But please, we don't know very much yet," said a nosey and snorty kind of voice. Andthat really did make the children jump, for it was the cab-horse who had spoken.

"Good old Strawberry," said Polly. "I am glad he was one of the ones picked out to be aTalking Beast." And the Cabby, who was now standing beside the children, said, "Strikeme pink. I always did say that 'oss 'ad a lot of sense, though."

"Creatures, I give you yourselves," said the strong, happy voice of Aslan. "I give to youforever this land of Narnia. I give you the woods, the fruits, the rivers. I give you the starsand I give you myself. The Dumb Beasts whom I have not chosen are yours also. Treatthem gently and cherish them but do not go back to their ways lest you cease to beTalking Beasts. For out of them you were taken and into them you can return. Do not so."

"No, Aslan, we won't, we won't," said everyone. But one perky jackdaw added in a loudvoice, "No fear!" and everyone else had finished just before he said it so that his wordscame out quite clear in a dead silence; and perhaps you have found out how awful thatcan be - say, at a party. The Jackdaw became so embarrassed that it hid its head under itswings as if it was going to sleep. And all the other animals began making various queernoises which are their ways of laughing and which, of course, no one has ever heard inour world. They tried at first to repress it, but Aslan said:

"Laugh and fear not, creatures. Now that you are no longer dumb and witless, you neednot always be grave. For jokes as well as justice come in with speech."

So they all let themselves go. And there was such merriment that the Jackdaw himselfplucked up courage again and perched on the cab-horse's head, between its ears, clappingits wings, and said:

"Aslan! Aslan! Have I made the first joke? Will everybody always be told how I madethe first joke?"

"No, little friend," said the Lion. "You have not made the first joke; you have only beenthe first joke." Then everyone laughed more than ever; but the Jackdaw didn't mind andlaughed just as loud till the horse shook its head and the Jackdaw lost its balance and felloff, but remembered its wings (they were still new to it) before it reached the ground.

"And now," said Aslan, "Narnia is established. We must next take thought for keeping itsafe. I will call some of you to my council. Come hither to me, you the chief Dwarf, andyou the River-god, and you Oak and the Owl, and both the Ravens and the Bull-Elephant.

We must talk together. For though the world is not five hours old an evil has alreadyentered it."

The creatures he had named came forward and he turned away eastward with them. Theothers all began talking, saying things like "What did he say had entered the world? - ANeevil - What's a Neevil? - No, he didn't say a Neevil, he said a weevil - Well, what'sthat?"

"Look here," said Digory to Polly, "I've got to go after him - Aslan, I mean, the Lion. Imust speak to him."

"Do you think we can?" said Polly. "I wouldn't dare."

"I've got to," said Digory. "It's about Mother. If anyone could give me something thatwould do her good, it would be him."

"I'll come along with you," said the Cabby. "I liked the looks of 'im. And I don't reckonthese other beasts will go for us. And I want a word with old Strawberry."

So all three of them stepped out boldly - or as boldly as they could - towards theassembly of animals. The creatures were so busy talking to one another and makingfriends that they didn't notice the three humans until they were very close; nor did theyhear Uncle Andrew, who was standing trembling in his buttoned boots a good way offand shouting (but by no means at the top of his voice).

"Digory! Come back! Come back at once when you're told. I forbid you to go a stepfurther."

When at last they were right in among the animals, the animals all stopped talking andstared at them.

"Well?" said the He-Beaver at last, "what, in the name of Aslan, are these?"

"Please," began Digory in rather a breathless voice, when a Rabbit said, "They're a kindof large lettuce, that's my belief."

"No, we're not, honestly we're not," said Polly hastily. "We're not at all nice to eat."

"There!" said the Mole. "They can talk. Who ever heard of a talking lettuce?"

"Perhaps they're the Second joke," suggested the Jackdaw.

A Panther, which had been washing its face, stopped for a moment to say, "Well, if theyare, they're nothing like so good as the first one. At least, 1 don't see anything very funnyabout them." It yawned and went on with its wash.

"Oh, please," said Digory. "I'm in such a hurry. I want to see the Lion."

All this time the Cabby had been trying to catch Strawberry's eye. Now he did. "Now,Strawberry, old boy," he said. "You know me. You ain't going to stand there and say asyou don't know me."

"What's the Thing talking about, Horse?" said several voices.

"Well," said Strawberry very slowly, "I don't exactly know, I think most of us don't knowmuch about any

thing yet. But I've a sort of idea I've seen a thing like this before. I've a feeling I livedsomewhere else - or was something else - before Aslan woke us all up a few minutes ago.

It's all very muddled. Like a dream. But there were things like these three in the dream."

"What?" said the Cabby. "Not know me? Me what used to bring you a hot mash of anevening when you was out of sorts? Me what rubbed you down proper? Me what neverforgot to put your cloth on you if you was standing in the _ cold? I wouldn't 'ave thoughtit of you, Strawberry."

"It does begin to come back," said the Horse thoughtfully. "Yes. Let me think now, let methink. Yes, you used to tie a horrid black thing behind me and then hit me to make merun, and however far I ran this black thing would always be coming rattle-rattle behindme."

"We 'ad our living to earn, see," said the Cabby. "Yours the same as mine. And if there'adn't been no work and no whip there'd 'ave been no stable, no hay, no mash, and nooats. For you did get a taste of oats when I could afford 'em, which no one can deny."

"Oats?" said the Horse, pricking up his ears. "Yes, I remember something about that. Yes,I remember more and more. You were always sitting up somewhere behind, and I wasalways running in front, pulling you and the black thing. I know I did all the work."

"Summer, I grant you," said the Cabby. " 'Ot work for you and a cool seat for me. Butwhat about winter, old boy, when you was keeping yourself warm and I was sitting up

there with my feet like ice and my nose fair pinched off me with the wind, and my 'andsthat numb I couldn't 'ardly 'old the reins?"

"It was a hard, cruel country," said Strawberry. "There was no grass. All hard stones."

"Too true, mate, too true!" said the Cabby. "A 'ard world it was. I always did say thosepaving-stones weren't fair on any 'oss. That's Lunn'on, that is. I didn't like it no more thanwhat you did. You were a country 'oss, and I was a country man. Used to sing in thechoir, I did, down at 'ome. But there wasn't a living for me there."

"Oh please, please," said Digory. "Could we get on? The Lion's getting further andfurther away. And I do want to speak to him so dreadfully badly."

"Look 'ere, Strawberry," said the Cabby. "This young gen'leman 'as something on hismind that he wants to talk to the Lion about; 'im you call Aslan. Suppose you was to let'im ride on your back (which 'e'd take it very kindly) and trot 'im over to where the Lionis. And me and the little girl will be following along."

"Ride?" said Strawberry. "Oh, I remember now. That means sitting on my back. Iremember there used to be a little one of you two-leggers who used to do that long ago.

He used to have little hard, square lumps of some white stuff that he gave me. Theytasted - oh, wonderful, sweeter than grass."

"Ah, that'd be sugar," said the Cabby.

"Please, Strawberry," begged Digory, "do, do let me get up and take me to Aslan."

"Well, I don't mind," said the Horse. "Not for once in a way. Up you get."

"Good old Strawberry," said the Cabby. "'Ere, young 'un, I'll give you a lift." Digory wassoon on Strawberry's back, and quite comfortable, for he had ridden bare-back before onhis own pony.

"Now, do gee up, Strawberry," he said.

"You don't happen to have a bit of that white stuff about you, I suppose?" said the Horse.

"No. I'm afraid I haven't," said Digory.

"Well, it can't be helped," said Strawberry, and off they went.

At that moment a large Bulldog, who had been sniffing and staring very hard, said:

"Look. Isn't there another of these queer creatures over there, beside the river, under thetrees?"

Then all the animals looked and saw Uncle Andrew, standing very still among therhododendrons and hoping he wouldn't be noticed.

"Come on!" said several voices. "Let's go and find out." So, while Strawberry was brisklytrotting away with Digory in one direction (and Polly and the Cabby were following onfoot) most of the creatures rushed towards Uncle Andrew with roars, barks, grunts, andvarious noises of cheerful interest.

We must now go back a bit and explain what the whole scene had looked like from UncleAndrew's point of view. It had not made at' all the same impression on him as on theCabby and the children. For what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you arestanding: it also depends on what sort of person you are.

Ever since the animals had first appeared, Uncle Andrew had been shrinking further andfurther back into the thicket. He watched them very hard of course; but he wasn't reallyinterested in seeing what they were doing, only in seeing whether they were going tomake a rush at him. Like the Witch, he was dreadfully practical. He simply didn't noticethat Aslan was choosing one pair out of every kind of beasts. All he saw, or thought hesaw, was a lot of dangerous wild animals walking vaguely about. And he kept onwondering why the other animals didn't run away from the big Lion.

When the great moment came and the Beasts spoke, he missed the whole point; for arather interesting reason. When the Lion had first begun singing, long ago when it wasstill quite dark, he had realized that the noise was a song. And he had disliked the songvery much. It made him think and feel things he did not want to think and feel. Then,when the sun rose and he saw that the singer was a lion ("only a lion," as he said tohimself) he tried his hardest to make believe that it wasn't singing and never had beensinging - only roaring as any lion might in a zoo in our own world. "Of course it can'treally have been singing," he thought, "I must have imagined it. I've been letting mynerves get out of order. Who ever heard of a lion singing?" And the longer and morebeautiful the Lion sang, the harder Uncle Andrew tried to make himself believe that hecould hear nothing but roaring. Now the trouble about trying to make yourself stupiderthan you really are is that you very often succeed. Uncle Andrew did. He soon did hearnothing but roaring in Aslan's song. Soon he couldn't have heard anything else even if hehad wanted to. And when at last the Lion spoke and said, "Narnia awake," he didn't hearany words: he heard only a snarl. And when the Beasts spoke in answer, he heard onlybarkings, growlings, bayings, and howlings. And when they laughed - well, you canimagine. That was worse for Uncle Andrew than anything that had happened yet. Such ahorrid, bloodthirsty din of hungry and angry brutes he had never heard in his life. Then,to his utter rage and horror, he saw the other three humans actually walking out into theopen to meet the animals.

"The fools!" he said to himself. "Now those brutes will eat the rings along with thechildren and I'll never be able to get home again. What a selfish little boy that Digory is!

And the others are just as bad. If they want to throw away their own lives, that's theirbusiness. But what about me? They don't seem to think of that. No one thinks of me."

Finally, when a whole crowd of animals came rushing towards him, he turned and ran forhis life. And now anyone could see that the air of that young world was really doing theold gentleman good. In London he had been far too old to run: now, he ran at a speedwhich would have made him certain to win the hundred yards' race at any Prep school inEngland. His coattails flying out behind him were a fine sight. But of course it was nouse. Many of the animals behind him were swift ones; it was the first run they had evertaken in their lives and they were all longing to use their new muscles. "After him! Afterhim!" they shouted. "Perhaps he's that Neevil! Tally-ho! Tantivy! Cut him off! Roundhim up! Keep it up! Hurrah!"

In a very few minutes some of them got ahead of him. They lined up in a row and barredhis way. Others hemmed him in from behind. Wherever he looked he saw terrors. Antlersof great elks and the huge face of an elephant towered over him. Heavy, serious-mindedbears and boars grunted behind him. Cool-looking leopards and panthers with sarcasticfaces (as he thought) stared at him and waved their tails. What struck him most of all wasthe number of open mouths. The animals had really opened their mouths to pant; hethought they had opened their mouths to eat him.

Uncle Andrew stood trembling and swaying this way and that. He had never likedanimals at the best of times, being usually rather afraid of them; and of course years ofdoing cruel experiments on animals had made him hate and fear them far more.

"Now, sir," said the Bulldog in his business-like way, "are you animal, vegetable, ormineral?" That was what it really said; but all Uncle Andrew heard was "Gr-r-rarrh-ow!"
