title: CHAPTER 9. THE FOUNDING OF NARNIA
---

THE Lion was pacing to and fro about that empty land and singing his new song. It wassofter and more lilting than the song by which he had called up the stars and the sun; agentle, rippling music. And as he walked and sang the valley grew green with grass. Itspread out from the Lion like a pool. It ran up the sides of the little hills like a wave. In afew minutes it was creeping up the lower slopes of the distant mountains, making thatyoung world every moment softer. The light wind could now be heard ruffling the grass.

Soon there were other things besides grass. The higher slopes grew dark with heather.

Patches of rougher and more bristling green appeared in the valley. Digory did not knowwhat they were until one began coming up quite close to him. It was a little, spiky thingthat threw out dozens of arms and covered these arms with green and grew larger at therate of about an inch every two seconds. There were dozens of these things all round himnow. When they were nearly as tall as himself he saw what they were. "Trees!" heexclaimed.

The nuisance of it, as Polly said afterwards, was that you weren't left in peace to watch itall. Just as Digory said "Trees!" he had to jump because Uncle Andrew had sidled up tohim again and was going to pick his pocket. It wouldn't have done Uncle Andrew muchgood if he had succeeded, for he was aiming at the right-hand pocket because he still

thought the green rings were "homeward" rings. But of course Digory didn't want to loseeither.

"Stop!" cried the Witch. "Stand back. No, further back. If anyone goes within ten pacesof either of the children, I will knock out his brains." She was poising in her hand the ironbar that she had torn off the lamp-post, ready to throw it. Somehow no one doubted thatshe would be a very good shot.

"So!" -she said. "You would steal back to your own world with the boy and leave mehere."

Uncle Andrew's temper at last got the better of his fears. "Yes, Ma'am, I would," he said.

"Most undoubtedly I would. I should be perfectly in my rights. I have been mostshamefully, most abominably treated. I have done my best to show you such civilities aswere in my power. And what has been my reward? You have robbed - I must repeat theword robbed a highly respectable jeweller. You have insisted on my entertaining you toan exceedingly expensive, not to say ostentatious, lunch, though I was obliged to pawnmy watch and chain in order to do so (and let me tell you, Ma'am, that none of our familyhave been in the habit of frequenting pawnshops, except my cousin Edward, and he wasin the Yeomanry). During that indigestible meal - I'm feeling the worse for it at this verymoment - your behaviour and conversation attracted the unfavourable attention ofeveryone present. I feel I have been publicly disgraced. I shall never be able to show myface in that restaurant again. You have assaulted the police. You have stolen -"

"Oh stow it, Guv'nor, do stow it," said the Cabby. "Watchin' and listenin's the thing atpresent; not talking."

There was certainly plenty to watch and to listen to. The tree which Digory had noticedwas now a full-grown beech whose branches swayed gently above his head. They stoodon cool, green grass, sprinkled with daisies and buttercups. A little way off, along theriver bank, willows were growing. On the other side tangles of flowering currant, lilac,wild rose, and rhododendron closed them in. The horse was tearing up deliciousmouthfuls of new grass.

All this time the Lion's song, and his stately prowl, to and fro, backwards and forwards,was going on. What was rather alarming was that at each turn he came a little nearer.

Polly was finding the song more and more interesting because she thought she wasbeginning to see the connection between the music and the things that were happening.

When a line of dark firs sprang up on a ridge about a hundred yards away she felt thatthey were connected with a series of deep, prolonged notes which the Lion had sung asecond before. And when he burst into a rapid series of lighter notes she was notsurprised to see primroses suddenly appearing in every direction. Thus, with anunspeakable thrill, she felt quite certain that all the things were coming (as she said) "outof the Lion's head". When you listened to his song you heard the things he was makingup: when you looked round you, you saw them. This was so exciting that she had no timeto be afraid. But Digory and the Cabby could not help feeling a bit nervous as each turn

of the Lion's walk brought him nearer. As for Uncle Andrew, his teeth were chattering,but his knees were shaking so that he could not run away.

Suddenly the Witch stepped boldly out towards the Lion. It was coming on, alwayssinging, with a slow, heavy pace. It was only twelve yards away. She raised her arm andflung the iron bar straight at its head.

Nobody, least of all Jadis, could have missed at that range. The bar struck the Lion fairbetween the eyes. It glanced off and fell with a thud in the grass. The Lion came on. Itswalk was neither slower nor faster than before; you could not tell whether it even knew ithad been hit. Though its soft pads made no noise, you could feel the earth shake beneaththeir weight.

The Witch shrieked and ran: in a few moments she was out of sight among the trees.

Uncle Andrew turned to do likewise, tripped over a root, and fell flat on his face in a littlebrook that ran down to join the river. The children could not move. They were not evenquite sure that they wanted to. The Lion paid no attention to them. Its huge red mouthwas open, but open in song not in a snarl. It passed by them so close that they could havetouched its mane. They were terribly afraid it would turn and look at them, yet in somequeer way they wished it would. But for all the notice it took of them they might just aswell have been invisible and unsmellable. When it had passed them and gone a few pacesfurther it turned, passed them again, and continued its march eastward.

Uncle Andrew, coughing and spluttering, picked himself up.

"Now, Digory," he said, "we've got rid of that woman, and the brute of a lion is gone.

Give me your hand and put on your ring at once."

"Keep off," said Digory, backing away from him. "Keep clear of him, Polly. Come overhere beside me. Now I warn you, Uncle Andrew, don't come one step nearer, we'll justvanish."

"Do what you're told this minute, sir," said Uncle Andrew. "You're an extremelydisobedient, ill-behaved little boy."

"No fear," said Digory. "We want to stay and see what happens. I thought you wanted toknow about other worlds. Don't you like it now you're here?"

"Like it!" exclaimed Uncle Andrew. "Just look at the state I'm in. And it was my best coatand waistcoat, too." He certainly was a dreadful sight by now: for of course, the moredressed up you were to begin with, the worse you look after you've crawled out of asmashed hansoncab and fallen into a muddy brook. "I'm not saying," he added, "that thisis not a most interesting place. If I were a younger man, now - perhaps I could get somelively young fellow to come here first. One of those big-game hunters. Something mightbe made of this country. The climate is delightful. I never felt such air. I believe it would

have done me good if - if circumstances had been more favourable. If only we'd had agun."

"Guns be blowed," said the Cabby. "I think I'll go and see if I can give Strawberry a rubdown. That horse 'as more sense than some 'umans as I could mention." He walked backto Strawberry and began making the hissing noises that grooms make.

"Do you still think that Lion could be killed by a gun?" asked Digory. "He didn't mindthe iron bar much."

"With all her faults," said Uncle Andrew, "that's a plucky gel, my boy. It was a spiritedthing to do." He rubbed his hands and cracked his knuckles, as if he were once moreforgetting how the Witch frightened him whenever she was really there.

"It was a wicked thing to do," said Polly. "What harm had he done her?"

"Hullo! What's that?" said Digory. He had darted forward to examine something only afew yards away. "I say, Polly," he called back. "Do come and look."

Uncle Andrew came with her; not because he wanted to see but because he wanted tokeep close to the children there might be a chance of stealing their rings. But when hesaw what Digory was looking at, even he began to take an interest. It was a perfect littlemodel of a lamp-post, about three feet high but lengthening, and thickening in proportion,as they watched it; in fact growing just as the trees had grown.

"It's alive too - I mean, it's lit," said Digory. And so it was; though of course, thebrightness of the sun made the little flame in the lantern hard to see unless your shadowfell on it.

"Remarkable, most remarkable," muttered Uncle Andrew. "Even I never dreamt of Magiclike this. We're in a world where everything, even a lamp-post, comes to life and grows.

Now I wonder what sort of seed a lamppost grows from?"

"Don't you see?" said Digory. "This is where the bar fell - the bar she tore off the lamp-

post at home. It sank into the ground and now it's coming up as a young lamppost." (Butnot so very young now; it was as tall as Digory while he said this.)

"That's it! Stupendous, stupendous," said Uncle Andrew, rubbing his hands harder thanever. "Ho, ho! They laughed at my Magic. That fool of a sister of mine thinks I'm alunatic. I wonder what they'll say now? I have discovered a world where everything isbursting with life and growth. Columbus, now, they talk about Columbus. But what wasAmerica to this? The commercial possibilities of this country are unbounded. Bring a fewold bits of scrap iron here, bury 'em, and up they come as brand new railway engines,battleships, anything you please. They'll cost nothing, and I can sell 'em at full prices inEngland. I shall be a millionaire. And then the climate! I feel years younger already. I canrun it as a health resort. A good sanatorium here might be worth twenty thousand a year.

Of course I shall have to let a few people into the secret. The first thing is to get that bruteshot."

"You're just like the Witch," said Polly. "All you think of is killing things."

"And then as regards oneself," Uncle Andrew continued, in a happy dream. "There's noknowing how long I might live if I settled here. And that's a big consideration when afellow has turned sixty. I shouldn't be surprised if I never grew a day older in thiscountry! Stupendous! The land of youth!"

"Oh!" cried Digory. "The land of youth! Do you think it really is?" For of course heremembered what Aunt Letty had said to the lady who brought the grapes, and that sweethope rushed back upon him. "Uncle Andrew", he said, "do you think there's anythinghere that would cure Mother?"

"What are you talking about?" said Uncle Andrew. "This isn't a chemist's shop. But as Iwas saying -"

"You don't care twopence about her," said Digory savagely. "I thought you might; afterall, she's your sister as well as my Mother. Well, no matter. I'm jolly well going to askthe Lion himself if he can help me." And he turned and walked briskly away. Pollywaited for a moment and then went after him.

"Here! Stop! Come back! The boy's gone mad," said Uncle Andrew. He followed thechildren at a cautious distance behind; for he didn't want to get too far away from thegreen rings or too near the Lion.

In a few minutes Digory came to the edge of the wood and there he stopped. The Lionwas singing still. But now the song had once more changed. It was more like what weshould call a tune, but it was also far wilder. It made you want to run and jump and climb.

It made you want to shout. It made you want to rush at other people and either hug themor fight them. It made Digory hot and red in the face. It had some effect on UncleAndrew, for Digory could hear him saying, "A spirited gel, sir. It's a pity about hertemper, but a dem fine woman all the same, a dem fine woman." But what the song did tothe two humans was nothing compared with what it was doing to the country.

Can you imagine a stretch of grassy land bubbling like water in a pot? For that is reallythe best description of what was happening. In all directions it was swelling into humps.

They were of very different sizes, some no bigger than mole-hills, some as big as wheel-

barrows, two the size of cottages. And the humps moved and swelled till they burst, andthe crumbled earth poured out of them, and from each hump there came out an animal.

The moles came out just as you might see a mole come out in England. The dogs cameout, barking the moment their heads were free, and struggling as you've seen them dowhen they are getting through a narrow hole in a hedge. The stags were the queerest towatch, for of course the antlers came up a long time before the rest of them, so at firstDigory thought they were trees. The frogs, who all came up near the river, went straight

into it with a plop-plop and a loud croaking. The panthers, leopards and things of thatsort, sat down at once to wash the loose earth off their hind quarters and then stood upagainst the trees to sharpen their front claws. Showers of birds came out of the trees.

Butterflies fluttered. Bees got to work on the flowers as if they hadn't a second to lose.

But the greatest moment of all was when the biggest hump broke like a small earthquakeand out came the sloping back, the large, wise head, and the four baggy-trousered legs ofan elephant. And now you could hardly hear the song of the Lion; there was so muchcawing, cooing, crowing, braying, neighing, baying, barking, lowing, bleating, andtrumpeting.

But though Digory could no longer hear the Lion, he could see it. It was so big and sobright that he could not take his eyes off it. The other animals did not appear to be afraidof it. Indeed, at that very moment, Digory heard the sound of hoofs from behind; asecond later the old cab-horse trotted past him and joined the other beasts. (The air hadapparently suited him as well as it had suited Uncle Andrew. He no longer looked like thepoor, old slave he had been in London; he was picking up his feet and holding his headerect.) And now, for the first time, the Lion was quite silent. He was going to and froamong the animals. And every now and then he would go up to two of them (always twoat a time) and touch their noses with his. He would touch two beavers among all thebeavers, two leopards among all the leopards, one stag and one deer among all the deer,and leave the rest. Some sorts of animal he passed over altogether. But the pairs which hehad touched instantly left their own kinds and followed him. At last he stood still and allthe creatures whom he had touched came and stood in a wide circle around him. Theothers whom he had not touched began to wander away. Their noises faded gradually intothe distance. The chosen beasts who remained were now utterly silent, all with their eyesfixed intently upon the Lion. The cat-like ones gave an occasional twitch of the tail butotherwise all were still. For the first time that day there was complete silence, except forthe noise of running water. Digory's heart beat wildly; he knew something very solemnwas going to be done. He had not forgotten about his Mother; but he knew jolly well that,even for her, he couldn't interrupt a thing like this.

The Lion, whose eyes never blinked, stared at the animals as hard as if he was going toburn them up with his mere stare. And gradually a change came over them. The smallerones - the rabbits, moles and such-like grew a good deal larger. The very big ones - younoticed it most with the elephants - grew a little smaller. Many animals sat up on theirhind legs. Most put their heads on one side as if they were trying very hard to understand.

The Lion opened his mouth, but no sound came from it; he was breathing out, a long,warm breath; it seemed to sway all the beasts as the wind sways a line of trees. Faroverhead from beyond the veil of blue sky which hid them the stars sang again; a pure,cold, difficult music. Then there came a swift flash like fire (but it burnt nobody) eitherfrom the sky or from the Lion itself, and every drop of blood tingled in the children'sbodies, and the deepest, wildest voice they had ever heard was saying:

"Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts.

Be divine waters."
