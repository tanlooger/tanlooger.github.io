title: CHAPTER 15. THE END OF THIS STORY AND THE BEGINNING OF ALL THE OTHERS
---

"You need no rings when I am with you," said the voice of Aslan. The children blinkedand looked about them. They were once more in the Wood between the Worlds; UncleAndrew lay on the grass, still asleep; Aslan stood beside them.

"Come," said Aslan; "it is time that you went back. But there are two things to see to first;a warning, and a command. Look here, children."

They looked and saw a little hollow in the grass, with a grassy bottom, warm and dry.

"When you were last here," said Aslan, "that hollow was a pool, and when you jumpedinto it you came to the world where a dying sun shone over the ruins of Charn. There isno pool now. That world is ended, as if it had never been. Let the race of Adam and Evetake warning."

"Yes, Aslan," said both the children. But Polly added, "But we're not quite as bad as thatworld, are we, Aslan?"

"Not yet, Daughter of Eve," he said. "Not yet. But you are growing more like it. It is notcertain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as theDeplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things. And soon, very soon, before youare an old man and an old woman, great nations in your world will be ruled by tyrantswho care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your worldbeware. That is the warning. Now for the command. As soon as you can, take from thisUncle of yours his magic rings and bury them so that no one can use them again."

Both the children were looking up into the Lion's face as he spoke these words. And all atonce (they never knew exactly how it happened) the face seemed to be a sea of tossinggold in which they were floating, and such a sweetness and power rolled about them andover them and entered them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise orgood, or even alive and awake, before. And the memory of that moment stayed with themalways, so that as long as they both lived, if ever they were sad or afraid or angry, thethought of all that golden goodness, and the feeling that it was still there, quite close, justround some corner or just behind some door, would come back and make them sure, deepdown inside, that all was well. Next minute all three of them (Uncle Andrew now awake)came tumbling into the noise, heat, and hot smells of London.

They were on the pavement outside the Ketterleys' front door, and except that the Witch,the Horse, and the Cabby were gone, everything was exactly as they had left it. Therewas the lamp-post, with one arm missing; there was the wreck of the hansom cab; andthere was the crowd. Everyone was still talking and people were kneeling beside thedamaged policeman, saying things like, "He's coming round" or "How do you feel now,old chap?" or "The Ambulance will be here in a jiffy."

"Great Scott!" thought Digory, "I believe the whole adventure's taken no time at all."

Most people were wildly looking round for Jadis and the horse. No one took any noticeof the children for no one had seen them go or noticed them coming back. As for UncleAndrew, what between the state of his clothes and the honey on his face, he could nothave been recognized by anyone. Fortunately the front door of the house was-open andthe housemaid was standing in the doorway staring at the fun (what a day that girl washaving!) so the children had no difficulty in bustling Uncle Andrew indoors beforeanyone asked any questions.

He raced up the stirs before them and at first they were very afraid he was heading for hisattic and meant to hide his remaining magic rings. But they needn't have bothered. Whathe was thinking about was the bottle in his wardrobe, and he disappeared at once into hisbedroom and locked the door. When he came out again (which was not for a long time)he was in his dressinggown and made straight for the bathroom.

"Can you get the other rings, Poll?" said Digory. "I want to go to Mother."

"Right. See you later," said Polly and clattered up the attic stairs.

Then Digory took a minute to get his breath, and then went softly into his Mother's room.

And there she lay, as he had seen her lie so many other times, propped up on the pillows,with a thin, pale face that would make you cry to look at. Digory took the Apple of Lifeout of his pocket.

And just as the Witch Jadis had looked different when you saw her in our world insteadof in her own, so the fruit of that mountain garden looked different too. There were ofcourse all sorts of coloured things in the bedroom; the coloured counterpane on the bed,the wallpaper, the sunlight from the window, and Mother's pretty, pale blue dressingjacket. But the moment Digory took the Apple out of his pocket, all those things seemedto have scarcely any colour at all. Every one of them, even the sunlight, looked faded anddingy. The brightness of the Apple threw strange lights on the ceiling. Nothing else wasworth looking at: you couldn't look at anything else. And the smell of the Apple of Youthwas as if there was a window in the room that opened on Heaven.

"Oh, darling, how lovely," said Digory's Mother.

"You will eat it, won't you? Please," said Digory.

"I don't know what the Doctor would say," she answered. "But really - I almost feel as if Icould."

He peeled it and cut it up and gave it to her piece by piece. And no sooner had shefinished it than she smiled and her head sank back on the pillow and she was asleep: areal, natural, gentle sleep, without any of those nasty drugs, which was, as Digory knew,the thing in the whole world that she wanted most. And he was sure now that her facelooked a little different. He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of theroom with a beating heart; taking the core of the apple with him. For the rest of that day,whenever he looked at the things about him, and saw how ordinary and unmagical theywere, he hardly dared to hope; but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope.

That evening he buried the core of the Apple in the back garden.

Next morning when the Doctor made his usual visit, Digory leaned over the banisters tolisten. He heard the Doctor come out with Aunt Letty and say:

"Miss Ketterley, this is the most extraordinary case I have known in my whole medicalcareer. It is - it is like a miracle. I wouldn't tell the little boy anything at present; we don'twant to raise any false hopes. But in my opinion -" then his voice became too low to hear.

That afternoon he went down the garden and whistled their agreed secret signal for Polly(she hadn't been able to get back the day before).

"What luck?" said Polly, looking over the wall. "I mean, about your Mother?"

"I think - I think it is going to be alright," said Digory. "But if you don't mind I'd reallyrather not talk about it yet. What about the rings?"

"I've got them all," said Polly. "Look, it's alright, I'm wearing gloves. Let's bury them."

"Yes, let's. I've marked the place where I buried the core of the Apple yesterday."

Then Polly came over the wall and they went together to the place. But, as it turned out,Digory need not have marked the place. Something was already coming up. It was notgrowing so that you could see it grow as the new trees had done in Narnia; but it wasalready well above ground. They got a trowel and buried all the magic rings, includingtheir own ones, in a circle round it.

About a week after this it was quite certain that Digory's Mother was getting better.

About a fortnight later she was able to sit out in the garden. And a month later that wholehouse had become a different place. Aunt Letty did everything that Mother liked;windows were opened, frowsy curtains were drawn back to brighten up the rooms, therewere new flowers everywhere, and nicer things to eat, and the old piano was tuned andMother took up her singing again, and had such games with Digory and Polly that AuntLetty would say "I declare, Mabel, you're the biggest baby of the three."

When things go wrong, you'll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; butwhen things once start going right they often go on getting better and better. After aboutsix weeks of this lovely life there came a long letter from Father in India, which hadwonderful news in it. Old Great-Uncle Kirke had died and this meant, apparently, thatFather was now very rich. He was going to retire and come home from India forever andever. And the great big house in the country, which Digory had heard of all his life andnever seen would now be their home; the big house with the suits of armour, the stables,the kennels, the river, the park, the hot-houses, the vineries, the woods, and the mountainsbehind it. So that Digory felt just as sure as you that they were all going to live happilyever after. But perhaps you would like to know just one or two things more.

Polly and Digory were always great friends and she came nearly every holidays to staywith them at their beautiful house in the country; and that was where she learned to rideand swim and milk and bake and climb.

In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any otherenemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years. King Frank and QueenHelen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King ofArchenland. The boys married nymphs and the girls married woodgods and river-gods.

The lamp-post which the Witch had planted (without knowing it) shone day and night inthe Narnian forest, so that the place where it grew came to be called Lantern Waste; andwhen, many years later, another child from our world got into Narnia, on a snowy night,she found the light still burning. And that adventure was, in a way, connected with theones I have just been telling you.

It was like this. The tree which sprang from the Apple that Digory planted in the backgarden, lived and grew into a fine tree. Growing in the soil of our world, far out of thesound of Aslan's voice and far from the young air of Narnia, it did not bear apples thatwould revive a dying woman as Digory's Mother had been revived, though it did bearapples more beautiful than any others in England, and they were extremely good for you,though not fully magical. But inside itself, in the very sap of it, the tree (so to speak)never forgot that other tree in Narnia to which it belonged. Sometimes it would movemysteriously when there was no wind blowing: I think that when this happened therewere high winds in Narnia and the English tree quivered because, at that moment, theNarnia tree was rocking and swaying in a strong south-western gale. However, that mightbe, it was proved later that there was still magic in its wood. For when Digory was quitemiddle-aged (and he was a famous learned man, a Professor, and a great traveller by thattime) and the Ketterleys' old house belonged to him, there was a great storm all over thesouth of England which blew the tree down. He couldn't bear to have it simply choppedup for firewood, so he had part of the timber made into a wardrobe, which he put in hisbig house in the country. And though he himself did not discover the magic properties ofthat wardrobe, someone else did. That was the beginning of all the comings and goingsbetween Narnia and our world, which you can read of in other books.

When Digory and his people went to live in the big country house, they took UncleAndrew to live with them; for Digory's Father said, "We must try to keep the old fellowout of mischief, and it isn't fair that poor Letty should have him always on her hands."Uncle Andrew never tried any Magic again as long as he lived. He had learned his lesson,and in his old age he became a nicer and less selfish old man than he had ever beenbefore. But he always liked to get visitors alone in the billiard-room and tell them storiesabout a mysterious lady, a foreign royalty, with whom he had driven about London. "Adevilish temper she had," he would say. "But she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem finewoman."
