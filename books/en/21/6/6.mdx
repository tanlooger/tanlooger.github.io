title: CHAPTER 6. THE BEGINNING OF UNCLE ANDREW'S TROUBLES
---

"LET go! Let go!" screamed Polly.

"I'm not touching you!" said Digory.

Then their heads came out of the pool and, once more, the sunny quietness of the Woodbetween the Worlds was all about them, and it seemed richer and warmer and morepeaceful than ever after the staleness and ruin of the place they had just left. I think that,if they had been given the chance, they would again have forgotten who they were andwhere they came from and would have lain down and enjoyed themselves, half asleep,listening to the growing of the trees. But this time there was something that kept them aswide-awake as possible: for as soon as they had got out on to the grass, they found thatthey were not alone. The Queen, or the Witch (whichever you like to call her) had comeup with them, holding on fast by Polly's hair. That was why Polly had been shouting out"Let go!"

This proved, by the way, another thing about the rings which Uncle Andrew hadn't toldDigory because he didn't know it himself. In order to jump from world to world by one ofthose rings you don't need to be wearing or touching it yourself; it is enough if you aretouching someone who is touching it. In that way they work like a magnet; and everyoneknows that if you pick up a pin with a magnet, any other pin which is touching the firstpin will come too.

Now that you saw her in the wood, Queen Jadis looked different. She was much palerthan she had been; so pale that hardly any of her beauty was left. And she was stoopedand seemed to be finding it hard to breathe, as if the air of that place stifled her. Neitherof the children felt in the least afraid of her now.

"Let go! Let go of my hair," said Polly. "What do you mean by it?"

"Here! Let go of her hair. At once," said Digory.

They both turned and struggled with her. They were stronger than she and in a fewseconds they had forced her to let go. She reeled back, panting, and there was a look ofterror in her eyes.

"Quick, Digory!" said Polly. "Change rings and into' the home pool."

"Help! Help! Mercy!" cried the Witch in a faint voice, staggering after them. "Take mewith you. You cannot. mean to leave me in this horrible place. It is killing me."

"It's a reason of State," said Polly spitefully. "Like when you killed all those people inyour own world. Do be quick, Digory." They had put on their green rings, but Digorysaid:

"Oh bother! What are we to do?" He couldn't help feeling a little sorry for the Queen.

"Oh don't be such an ass," said Polly. "Ten to one she's only shamming. Do come on."And then both children plunged into the home pool. "It's a good thing we made thatmark," thought Polly. But as they jumped Digory felt that a large cold finger and thumbhad caught him by the ear. And as they sank down and the confused shapes of our ownworld began to appear, the grip of that finger and thumb grew stronger. The Witch wasapparently recovering her strength. Digory struggled and kicked, but it was not of theleast use. In a moment they found themselves in Uncle Andrew's study; and there wasUncle Andrew himself, staring at the wonderful creature that Digory had brought backfrom beyond the world.

And well he might stare. Digory and Polly stared too. There was no doubt that the Witchhad got over her faintness; and now that one saw her in our own world, with ordinarythings around her, she fairly took one's breath away. In Charn she had been alarmingenough: in London, she was terrifying. For one thing, they had not realized till now howvery big she was. "Hardly human" was what Digory thought when he looked at her; and

he may have been right, for some say there is giantish blood in the royal family of Charn.

But even her height was nothing compared with her beauty, her fierceness, and herwildness. She looked ten times more alive than most of the people one meets in London.

Uncle Andrew was bowing and rubbing his hands and looking, to tell the truth, extremelyfrightened. He seemed a little shrimp of a creature beside the Witch. And yet, as Pollysaid after

wards, there was a sort of likeness between her face and his, something in the expression.

It was the look that all wicked Magicians have, the "Mark" which Jadis had said shecould not find in Digory's face. One good thing about seeing the two together was thatyou would never again be afraid of Uncle Andrew, any more than you'd be afraid of aworm after you had met a rattlesnake or afraid of a cow after you had met a mad bull.

"Pooh!" thought Digory to himself. "Him a Magician!

Not much. Now she's the real thing."

Uncle Andrew kept on rubbing his hands and bowing. He was trying to say somethingvery polite, but his mouth had gone all dry so that he could not speak. His "experiment"with the rings, as he called it, was turning out more successful than he liked: for thoughhe had dabbled in Magic for years he had always left all the dangers (as far as one can) toother people. Nothing at all like this had ever happened to him before.

Then Jadis spoke; not very loud, but there was something in her voice that made thewhole room quiver.

"Where is the Magician who has called me into this world?"

"Ah - ah - Madam," gasped Uncle Andrew, "I am most honoured - highly gratified - amost unexpected, pleasure - if only I had had the opportunity of making any preparations- I - I -"

"Where is the Magician, Fool?" said Jadis.

"I - I am, 'Madam. I hope you will excuse any - er -. liberty these naughty children mayhave taken. I assure you, there was no intention -"

"You?" said the Queen in a still more terrible voice. Then, in one stride, she crossed theroom, seized a great handful of Uncle Andrew's grey hair and pulled his head back so thathis face looked up into hers. Then she studied his face as she had studied Digory's face inthe palace of Charn. He blinked and licked his lips nervously all the time. At last she lethim go: so suddenly that he reeled back against the wall.

"I see," she said scornfully, "you are a Magician - of a sort. Stand up, dog, and don'tsprawl there as if you were speaking to your equals. How do you come to know Magic?

You are not of royal blood, I'll swear."

"Well - ah - not perhaps in the strict sense," stammered Uncle Andrew. "Not exactlyroyal, Ma'am. The Ketterleys are, however, a very old family. An old Dorsetshire family,Ma'am."

"Peace," said the Witch. "I see what you are. You are a little, peddling Magician whoworks by rules and books. There is no real Magic in your blood and heart. Your kind wasmade an end of in my world a thousand years ago. But here I shall allow you to be myservant."

"I should be most happy - delighted to be of any service - a p-pleasure, I assure you."

"Peace! You talk far too much. Listen to your first task. I see we are in a large city.

Procure for me at once a chariot or a flying carpet or a well-trained dragon, or whatever isusual for royal and noble persons in your land. Then bring me to places where I can getclothes and jewels and slaves fit for my rank. Tomorrow I will begin the conquest of theworld."

"I - I - I'll go and order a cab at once," gasped Uncle Andrew.

"Stop," said the Witch, just as he reached the door. "Do not dream of treachery. My eyescan see through walls and into the minds of men. They will be on you wherever you go.

At the first sign of disobedience I will lay such spells on you that anything you sit downon will feel like red hot iron and whenever you lie in a bed there will be invisible blocksof ice at your feet. Now go."

The old man went out, looking like a dog with its tail between its legs.

The children were now afraid that Jadis would have something to say to them about whathad happened in the wood. As it turned out, however, she never mentioned it either thenor afterwards. I think (and Digory thinks too) that her mind was of a sort which cannotremember that quiet place at all, and however often you took her there and however longyou left her there, she would still know nothing about it. Now that she was left alone withthe children, she took no notice of either of them. And that was like her too. In Charn shehad taken no notice of Pony (till the very end) because Digory was the one she wanted tomake use of. Now that she had Uncle Andrew, she took no notice of Digory. I expectmost witches are like that. They are not interested in things or people unless they can usethem; they are terribly practical. So there was silence in the room for a minute or two.

But you could tell by the way Jadis tapped her foot on the floor that she was growingimpatient.

Presently she said, as if to herself, "What is the old fool doing? I should have brought awhip." She stalked out of the room in pursuit of Uncle Andrew without one glance at thechildren.

"Whew!" said Polly, letting out a long breath of relief. "And now I must get home. It'sfrightfully late. I shall catch it."

"Well do, do come back as soon as you can," said Digory. "This is simply ghastly, havingher here. We must make some sort of plan."

"That's up to your Uncle now," said Polly. "It was he who started all this messing aboutwith Magic."

"All the same, you will come back, won't you? Hang it all, you can't leave me alone in ascrape like this."

"I shall go home by the tunnel," said Polly rather coldly. "That'll be the quickest way.

And if you want me to come back, hadn't you better say you're sorry?"

"Sorry?" exclaimed Digory. "Well now, if that isn't just like a girl! What have I done?"

"Oh nothing of course," said Polly sarcastically. "Only nearly screwed my wrist off inthat room with all the waxworks, like a cowardly bully. Only struck the bell with thehammer, like a silly idiot. Only turned back in the wood so that she had time to catchhold of you before we jumped into our own pool. That's all."

"Oh," said Digory, very surprised. "Well, alright, I'll say I'm sorry. And I really am sorryabout what happened in the waxworks room. There: I've said I'm sorry. And now, do bedecent and come back. I shall be in a frightful hole if you don't."

"I don't see what's going to happen to you. It's Mr Ketterley who's going to sit on red hotchairs and have ice in his bed, isn't it?"

"It isn't that sort of thing," said Digory. "What I'm bothered about is Mother. Suppose thatcreature went into her room. She might frighten her to death."

"Oh, I see," said Polly in rather a different voice. "Alright. We'll call it Pax. I'll comeback - if I can. But I must go now." And she crawled through the little door into thetunnel; and that dark place among the rafters which had seemed so exciting andadventurous a few hours ago, seemed quite tame and homely now.

We must now go back to Uncle Andrew. His poor old heart went pit-a-pat as hestaggered down the attic stairs and he kept on dabbing at his forehead with ahandkerchief. When he reached his bedroom, which was the floor below, he lockedhimself in. And the very first thing he did was to grope in his wardrobe for a bottle and awine-glass which he always kept hidden there where Aunt Letty could not find them. Hepoured himself out a glassful of some nasty, grown-up drink and drank it off at one gulp.

Then he drew a deep breath.

"Upon my word," he said to himself. "I'm dreadfully shaken. Most upsetting! And at mytime of life!"

He poured out a second glass and drank it too; then he began to change his clothes. Youhave never seen such clothes, but I can remember them. He put on a very high, shiny,stiff collar of the sort that made you hold your chin up all the time. He put on a whitewaistcoat with a pattern on it and arranged his gold watch chain across the front. He puton his best frock-coat, the one he kept for weddings and funerals. He got out his best tallhat and polished it up. There was a vase of flowers (put there by Aunt Letty) on hisdressing table; he took one and put it in his buttonhole. He took a clean handkerchief (alovely one such as you couldn't buy today) out of the little lefthand drawer and put a fewdrops of scent on it. He took his eye-glass, with the thick black ribbon, and screwed itinto his eye; then he looked at himself in the mirror.

Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind. Atthis moment Uncle Andrew was beginning to be silly in a very grown-up way. Now thatthe Witch was no longer in the same room with him he was quickly forgetting how shehad frightened him and thinking more and more of her wonderful beauty. He kept onsaying to himself, "A dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman. A superb creature." Hehad also somehow managed to forget that it was the children who had got hold of this"superb creature": he felt as if he himself by his Magic had called her out of unknownworlds.

"Andrew, my boy," he said to himself as he looked in the glass, "you're a devilish wellpreserved fellow for your age. A distinguished-looking man, sir."

You see, the foolish old man was actually beginning to imagine the Witch would fall inlove with him. The two drinks probably had something to do with it, and so had his bestclothes. But he was, in any case, as vain as a peacock; that was why he had become aMagician.

He unlocked' the door, went downstairs, sent the housemaid out to fetch a hansom(everyone had lots of servants in those days) and looked into the drawingroom. There, ashe expected, he found Aunt Letty. She was busily mending a mattress. It lay on the floornear the window and she was kneeling on it.

"Ah, Letitia my dear," said Uncle Andrew, "I - ah have to go out. Just lend me fivepounds or so, there's a good gel." ("Gel" was the way he pronounced girl.)

"No, Andrew dear," said Aunty Letty in her firm, quiet voice, without looking up fromher work. "I've told you times without number that I will not lend you money."

"Now pray don't be troublesome, my dear gel," said Uncle Andrew. "It's most important.

You will put me in a deucedly awkward position if you don't."

"Andrew," said Aunt Letty, looking him straight in the face, "I wonder you are notashamed to ask me for money."

There was a long, dull story of a grown-up kind behind these words. All you need toknow about it is that Uncle Andrew, what with "managing dear Letty's business mattersfor her", and never doing any work, and running up large bills for brandy and cigars(which Aunt Letty had paid again and again) had made her a good deal poorer than shehad been thirty years ago.

"My dear gel," said Uncle Andrew, "you don't understand. I shall have some quiteunexpected expenses today. I have to do a little entertaining. Come now, don't betiresome."

"And who, pray, are you going to entertain, Andrew?" asked Aunt Letty.

"A - a most distinguished visitor has just arrived."

"Distinguished fiddlestick!" said Aunt Letty. "There hasn't been a ring at the hell for thelast hour."

At that moment the door was suddenly flung open. Aunt Letty looked round and saw withamazement that an enormous woman, splendidly dressed, with bare arms and flashingeyes, stood in the doorway. It was the Witch.
