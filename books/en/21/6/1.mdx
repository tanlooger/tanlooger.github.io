title: CHAPTER 1. THE WRONG DOOR
---

This is a story about something that happened long ago when your grandfather was achild. It is a very important story because it shows how all the comings and goingsbetween our own world and the land of Narnia first began.

In those days Mr Sherlock Holmes was still living in Baker Street and the Bastables werelooking for treasure in the Lewisham Road. In those days, if you were a boy you had towear a stiff Eton collar every day, and schools were usually nastier than now. But mealswere nicer; and as for sweets, I won't tell you how cheap and good they were, because itwould only make your mouth water in vain. And in those days there lived in London agirl called Polly Plummer.

She lived in one of a long row of houses which were all joined together. One morning shewas out in the back garden when a boy scrambled up from the garden next door and puthis face over the wall. Polly was very surprised because up till now there had never beenany children in that house, but only Mr Ketterley and Miss Ketterley, a brother and sister,old bachelor and old maid, living together. So she looked up, full of curiosity. The face ofthe strange boy was very grubby. It could hardly have been grubbier if he had first rubbedhis hands in the earth, and then had a good cry, and then dried his face with his hands. Asa matter of fact, this was very nearly what he had been doing.

"Hullo," said Polly.

"Hullo," said the boy. "What's your name?"

"Polly," said Polly. "What's yours?"

"Digory," said the boy.

"I say, what a funny name!" said Polly.

"It isn't half so funny as Polly," said Digory.

"Yes it is," said Polly.

"No, it isn't," said Digory.

"At any rate I do wash my face," said Polly, "Which is what you need to do; especiallyafter -" and then she stopped. She had been going to say "After you've been blubbing,"but she thought that wouldn't be polite.

"Alright, I have then," said Digory in a much louder voice, like a boy who was somiserable that he didn't care who knew he had been crying. "And so would you," he wenton, "if you'd lived all your life in the country and had a pony, and a river at the bottom ofthe garden, and then been brought to live in a beastly Hole like this."

"London isn't a Hole," said Polly indignantly. But the boy was too wound up to take anynotice of her, and he went on "And if your father was away in India - and you had tocome and live with an Aunt and an Uncle who's mad (who would like that?) - and if thereason was that they were looking after your Mother - and if your Mother was ill and wasgoing to - going to - die." Then his face went the wrong sort of shape as it does if you'retrying to keep back your tears.

"I didn't know. I'm sorry," said Polly humbly. And then, because she hardly knew what tosay, and also to turn Digory's mind to cheerful subjects, she asked:

"Is Mr Ketterley really mad?"

"Well either he's mad," said Digory, "or there's some other mystery. He has a study on thetop floor and Aunt Letty says I must never go up there. Well, that looks fishy to beginwith. And then there's another thing. Whenever he tries to say anything to me at mealtimes - he never even tries to talk to her - she always shuts him up. She says, "Don'tworry the boy, Andrew" or "I'm sure Digory doesn't want to hear about that" or else"Now, Digory, wouldn't you like to go out and play in the garden?"

"What sort of things does he try to say?"

"I don't know. He never gets far enough. But there's more than that. One night - it waslast night in fact - as I was going past the foot of the attic-stairs on my way to bed (and Idon't much care for going past them either) I'm sure I heard a yell."

"Perhaps he keeps a mad wife shut up there."

"Yes, I've thought of that."

"Or perhaps he's a coiner."

"Or he might have been a pirate, like the man at the beginning of Treasure Island, and bealways hiding from his old shipmates."

"How exciting!" said Polly, "I never knew your house was so interesting." .

"You may think it interesting," said Digory. "But you wouldn't like it if you had to sleepthere. How would you like to lie awake listening for Uncle Andrew's step to comecreeping along the passage to your room? And he has such awful eyes."

That was how Polly and Digory got to know one another: and as it was just the beginningof the summer holidays and neither of them was going to the sea that year, they metnearly every day.

Their adventures began chiefly because it was one of the wettest and coldest summersthere had been for years. That drove them to do indoor things: you might say, indoorexploration. It is wonderful how much exploring you can do with a stump of candle in abig house, or in a row of houses. Polly had discovered long ago that if you opened acertain little door in the box-room attic of her house you would find the cistern and a darkplace behind it which you could get into by a little careful climbing. The dark place waslike a long tunnel with brick wall on one side and sloping roof on the other. In the roofthere were little chunks of light between the slates. There was no floor in this tunnel: youhad to step from rafter to rafter, and between them there was only plaster. If you steppedon this you would find yourself falling through the ceiling of the room below. Polly hadused the bit of the tunnel just beside the cistern as a smugglers' cave. She had brought upbits of old packing cases and the seats of broken kitchen chairs, and things of that sort,and spread them across from rafter to rafter so as to make a bit of floor. Here she kept acash-box containing various treasures, and a story she was writing and usually a fewapples. She had often drunk a quiet bottle of ginger-beer in there: the old bottles made itlook more like a smugglers' cave.

Digory quite liked the cave (she wouldn't let him see the story) but he was moreinterested in exploring.

"Look here," he said. "How long does this tunnel go on for? I mean, does it stop whereyour house ends?"

"No," said Polly. "The walls don't go out to the roof. It goes on. I don't know how far."

"Then we could get the length of the whole row of houses."

"So we could," said Polly, "And oh, I say!"

"What?"

"We could get into the other houses."

"Yes, and get taken up for burglars! No thanks."

"Don't be so jolly clever. I was thinking of the house beyond yours." ,

"What about it?"

"Why, it's the empty one. Daddy says it's always been empty since we came here."

"I suppose we ought to have a look at it then," said Digory. He was a good deal moreexcited than you'd have thought from the way he spoke. For of course he was thinking,just as you would have been, of all the reasons why the house might have been empty solong. So was Polly. Neither of them said the word "haunted". And both felt that once thething had been suggested, it would be feeble not to do it.

"Shall we go and try it now?" said Digory.

"Alright," said Polly.

"Don't if you'd rather not," said Digory.

"I'm game if you are," said she.

"How are we to know we're in the next house but one?" They decided they would have togo out into the boxroom and walk across it taking steps as long as the steps from onerafter to the next. That would give them an idea of how many rafters went to a room.

Then they would allow about four more for the passage between the two attics in Polly'shouse, and then the same number for the maid's bedroom as for the box-room. Thatwould give them the length of the house. When they had done that distance twice theywould be at the end of Digory's house; any door they came to after that would let theminto an attic of the empty house.

"But I don't expect it's really empty at all," said Digory.

"What do you expect?"

"I expect someone lives there in secret, only coming in and out at night, with a darklantern. We shall probably discover a gang of desperate criminals and get a reward. It'sall rot to say a house would be empty all those years unless there was some mystery."

"Daddy thought it must be the drains," said Polly.

"Pooh! Grown-ups are always thinking of uninteresting explanations," said Digory. Nowthat they were talking by daylight in the attic instead of by candlelight in the Smugglers'Cave it seemed much less likely that the empty house would be haunted.

When they had measured the attic they had to get a pencil and do a sum. They both gotdifferent answers to it at first, and even when they agreed I am not sure they got it right.

They were in a hurry to start on the exploration.

"We mustn't make a sound," said Polly as they climbed in again behind the cistern.

Because it was such an important occasion they took a candle each (Polly had a goodstore of them in her cave).

It was very dark and dusty and draughty and they stepped from rafter to rafter without aword except when they whispered to one another, "We're opposite your attic now" or"this must be halfway through our house". And neither of them stumbled and the candlesdidn't go out, and at last they came where they could see a little door in the brick wall ontheir right. There was no bolt or handle on this side of it, of course, for the door had beenmade for getting in, not for getting out; but there was a catch (as there often is on theinside of a cupboard door) which they felt sure they would be able to turn.

"Shall I?" said Digory.

"I'm game if you are," said Polly, just as she had said before. Both felt that it wasbecoming very serious, but neither would draw back. Digory pushed round the catch withsome difficultly. The door swung open and the sudden daylight made them blink. Then,with a great shock, they saw that they were looking, not into a deserted attic, but into afurnished room. But it seemed empty enough. It was dead silent. Polly's curiosity got thebetter of her. She blew out her candle and stepped out into the strange room, making nomore noise than a mouse.

It was shaped, of course, like an attic, but furnished as a sitting-room. Every bit of thewalls was lined with shelves and every bit of the shelves was full of books. A fire wasburning in the grate (you remember that it was a very cold wet summer that year) and infront of the fire-place with its back towards them was a high-backed armchair. Betweenthe chair and Polly, and filling most of the middle of the room, was a big table piled withall sorts of things printed books, and books of the sort you write in, and ink bottles andpens and sealing-wax and a microscope. But what she noticed first was a bright redwooden tray with a number of rings on it. They were in pairs - a yellow one and a greenone together, then a little space, and then another yellow one and another green one. Theywere no bigger than ordinary rings, and no one could help noticing them because theywere so bright. They were the most beautiful shiny little things you can imagine. If Pollyhad been a very little younger she would have wanted to put one in her mouth.

The room was so quiet that you noticed the ticking of the clock at once. And yet, as shenow found, it was not absolutely quiet either. There was a faint - a very, very faint -

humming sound. If Hoovers had been invented in those days Polly would have thought itwas the sound of a Hoover being worked a long way off - several rooms away andseveral floors below. But it was a nicer sound than that, a more musical tone: only sofaint that you could hardly hear it.

"It's alright; there's no one here," said Polly over her shoulder to Digory. She wasspeaking above a whisper now. And Digory came out, blinking and looking extremelydirty - as indeed Polly was too.

"This is no good," he said. "It's not an empty house at all. We'd better bunk before anyonecomes."

"What do you think those are?" said Polly, pointing at the coloured rings.'

"Oh come on," said Digory. "The sooner-"

He never finished what he was going to say for at that moment something happened. Thehigh-backed chair in front of the fire moved suddenly and there rose up out of it - like apantomime demon coming up out of a trapdoor the alarming form of Uncle Andrew.

They were not in the empty house at all; they were in Digory's house and in the forbiddenstudy! Both children said "O-o-oh" and realized their terrible mistake. They felt theyought to have known all along that they hadn't gone nearly far enough.

Uncle Andrew was tall and very thin. He had a long clean-shaven face with a sharply-

pointed nose and extremely bright eyes and a great tousled mop of grey hair.

Digory was quite speechless, for Uncle Andrew looked a thousand times more alarmingthan he had ever looked before. Polly was not so frightened yet; but she soon was. For thevery first thing Uncle Andrew did was to walk across to the door of the room, shut it, andturn the key in the lock. Then he turned round, fixed the children with his bright eyes, andsmiled, showing all his teeth.

"There!" he said. "Now my fool of a sister can't get at you!"

It was dreadfully unlike anything a grown-up would be expected to do. Polly's heart cameinto her mouth, and she and Digory started backing towards the little door they had comein by. Uncle Andrew was too quick for them. He got behind them and shut that door tooand stood in front of it. Then he rubbed his hands and made his knuckles crack. He hadvery long, beautifully white, fingers.

"I am delighted to see you," he said. "Two children are just what I wanted."

"Please, Mr Ketterley," said Polly. "It's nearly my dinner time and I've got to go home.

Will you let us out, please?"

"Not just yet," said Uncle Andrew. "This is too good an opportunity to miss. I wantedtwo children. You see, I'm in the middle of a great experiment. I've tried it on a guinea-

pig and it seemed to work. But then a guinea-pig can't tell you anything. And you can'texplain to it how to come back."

"Look here, Uncle Andrew," said Digory, "it really is dinner time and they'll be lookingfor us in a moment. You must let us out."

"Must?" said Uncle Andrew.

Digory and Polly glanced at one another. They dared not say anything, but the glancesmeant "Isn't this dreadful?" and "We must humour him."

"If you let us go for our dinner now," said Polly, "we could come back after dinner."

"Ah, but how do I know that you would?" said Uncle Andrew with a cunning smile. Thenhe seemed to change his mind.

"Well, well," he said, "if you really must go, I suppose you must. I can't expect twoyoungsters like you to find it much fun talking to an old buffer like me." He sighed andwent on. "You've no idea how lonely I sometimes am. But no matter. Go to your dinner.

But I must give you a present before you go. It's not every day that I see a little girl in mydingy old study; especially, if I may say so, such a very attractive young lady asyourself."

Polly began to think he might not really be mad after all.

"Wouldn't you like a ring, my dear?" said Uncle Andrew to Polly.

"Do you mean one of those yellow or green ones?" said Polly. "How lovely!"

"Not a green one," said Uncle Andrew. "I'm afraid I can't give the green ones away. ButI'd be delighted to give you any of the yellow ones: with my love. Come and try one on."

Polly had now quite got over her fright and felt sure that the old gentleman was not mad;and there was certainly something strangely attractive about those bright rings. Shemoved over to the tray.

"Why! I declare," she said. "That humming noise gets louder here. It's almost as if therings were making it."

"What a funny fancy, my dear," said Uncle Andrew with a laugh. It sounded a verynatural laugh, but Digory had seen an eager, almost a greedy, look on his face.

"Polly! Don't be a fool!" he shouted. "Don't touch them."

It was too late. Exactly as he spoke, Polly's hand went out to touch one of the rings. Andimmediately, without a flash or a noise or a warning of any sort, there was no Polly.

Digory and his Uncle were alone in the room.
