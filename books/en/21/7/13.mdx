title: CHAPTER 13. HOW THE DWARFS REFUSED TO BE TAKEN IN
---

TIRIAN had thought - or he would have thought if he had time to think at all - that theywere inside a little thatched stable, about twelve feet long and six feet wide. In realitythey stood on grass, the deep blue sky was overhead, and the air which blew gently ontheir faces was that of a day in early summer. Not far away from them rose a grove oftrees, thickly leaved, but under every leaf there peeped out the gold or faint yellow orpurple or glowing red of fruits such as no one has seen in our world. The fruit madeTirian feel that it must be autumn but there was something in the feel of the air that toldhim it could not be later than June. They all moved towards the trees.

Everyone raised his hand to pick the fruit he best liked the look of, and then everyonepaused for a second. This fruit was so beautiful that each felt "It can't be meant for me...

surely we're not allowed to pluck it."

"It's all right," said Peter. "I know what we're all thinking. But I'm sure, quite sure, weneedn't. I've a feeling we've got to the country where everything is allowed."

"Here goes, then!" said Eustace. And they all began to eat.

What was the fruit like? Unfortunately no one can describe a taste. All I can say is that,compared with those fruits, the freshest grapefruit you've ever eaten was dull, and thejuiciest orange was dry, and the most melting pear was hard and woody, and the sweetestwild strawberry was sour. And there were no seeds or stones, and no wasps. If you hadonce eaten that fruit, all the nicest things in this world would taste like medicines after it.

But I can't describe it. You can't find out what it is like unless you can get to that countryand taste it for yourself.

When they had eaten enough, Eustace said to King Peter, "You haven't yet told us howyou got here. You were just going to, when King Tirian turned up."

"There's not much to tell," said Peter. "Edmund and I were standing on the platform andwe saw your train coming in. I remember thinking it was taking the bend far too fast. AndI remember thinking how funny it was that our people were probably in the same trainthough Lucy didn't know about it -"

"Your people, High King?" said Tirian.

"I mean my Father and Mother - Edmund's and Lucy's and mine."

"Why were they?" asked Jill. "You don't mean to say they know about Narnia?"

"Oh no, it had nothing to do with Narnia. They were on their way to Bristol. I'd onlyheard they were going that morning. But Edmund said they'd be bound to be going bythat train." (Edmund was the sort of person who knows about railways.)

"And what happened then?" said Jill.

"Well, it's not very easy to describe, is it, Edmund?" said the High King.

"Not very," said Edmund. "It wasn't at all like that other time when we were pulled out ofour own world by Magic. There was a frightful roar and something hit me with a bang,but it didn't hurt. And I felt not so much scared as - well, excited. Oh - and this is onequeer thing.

I'd had a rather sore knee, from a hack at rugger. I noticed it had suddenly gone. And Ifelt very light. And then - here we were."

"It was much the same for us in the railway carriage," said the Lord Digory, wiping thelast traces of the fruit from his golden beard. "Only I think you and I, Polly, chiefly felt

that we'd been unstiffened. You youngsters won't understand. But we stopped feelingold."

"Youngsters, indeed!" said Jill. "I don't believe you two really are much older than we arehere."

"Well if we aren't, we have been," said the Lady Polly.

"And what has been happening since you got here?" asked Eustace.

"Well," said Peter, "for a long time (at least I suppose it was a long time) nothinghappened. Then the door opened -"

"The door?" said Tirian.

"Yes," said Peter. "The door you came in - or came out - by. Have you forgotten?"

"But where is it?"

"Look," said Peter and pointed.

Tirian looked and saw the queerest and most ridiculous thing you can imagine. Only afew yards away, clear to be seen in the sunlight, there stood up a rough wooden door and,round it, the framework of the doorway: nothing else, no walls, no roof. He walkedtowards it, bewildered, and the others followed, watching to see what he would do. Hewalked round to the other side of the door. But it looked just the same from the otherside: he was still in the open air, on a summer morning. The door was simply standing upby itself as if it had grown there like a tree.

"Fair Sir," said Tirian to the High King, "this is a great marvel."

"It is the door you came through with that Calormene five minutes ago," said Petersmiling.

"But did I not come in out of the wood into the stable? Whereas this seems to be a doorleading from nowhere to nowhere."

"It looks like that if you walk round it," said Peter. "But put your eye to that place wherethere is a crack between two of the planks and look through."

Tirian put his eye to the hole. At first he could see nothing but blackness. Then, at hiseyes grew used to it, he saw the dull red glow of a bonfire that was nearly going out, andabove that, in a black sky, stars. Then he could see dark figures moving about or standingbetween him and the fire: he could hear them talking and their voices were like those ofCalormenes. So he knew that he was looking out through the stable door into thedarkness of Lantern Waste where he had fought his last battle. The men were discussing

whether to go in and look for Rishda Tarkaan (but none of them wanted to do that) or toset fire to the stable.

He looked round again and could hardly believe his eyes. There was the blue skyoverhead, and grassy country spreading as far as he could see in every direction, and hisnew friends all round him laughing.

"It seems, then," said Tirian, smiling himself, "that the stable seen from within and thestable seen from without are two different places."

"Yes," said the Lord Digory. "Its inside is bigger than its outside."

"Yes," said Queen Lucy. "In our world too, a stable once had something inside it that wasbigger than our whole world." It was the first time she had spoken, and from the thrill inher voice, Tirian now knew why. She was drinking everything in even more deeply thanthe others. She had been too happy to speak. He wanted to hear her speak again, so hesaid:

"Of your courtesy, Madam, tell on. Tell me your whole adventure."

"After the shock and the noise," said Lucy, "we found ourselves here. And we wonderedat the door, as you did. Then the door opened for the first time (we saw darkness throughthe doorway when it did) and there came through a big man with a naked sword. We sawby his arms that he was a Calormene. He took his stand beside the door with his swordraised, resting on his shoulder, ready to cut down anyone who came through. We went tohim and spoke to him, but we thought he could neither see nor hear us. And he neverlooked round on the sky and the sunlight and the grass: I think he couldn't see themeither. So then we waited a long time. Then we heard the bolt being drawn on the otherside of the door. But the man didn't get ready to strike with his sword till he could seewho was coming in. So we supposed he had been told to strike some and spare others.

But at the very moment when the door opened, all of a sudden Tash was there, on thisside of the door; none of us saw where he came from. And through the door there came abig Cat. It gave one look at Tash and ran for its life: just in time, for he pounced at it andthe door hit his beak as it was shut. The man could see Tash. He turned very pale andbowed down before the Monster: but it vanished away.

"Then we waited a long time again. At last the door opened for the third time and therecame in a young Calormene. I liked him. The sentinel at the door started, and looked verysurprised, when he saw him. I think he'd been expecting someone quite different -"

"I see it all now," said Eustace (he had the bad habit of interrupting stories). "The Cat wasto go in first and the sentry had orders to do him no harm. Then the Cat was to come outand say he'd seen their beastly Tashlan and pretend to be frightened so as to scare theother Animals. But what Shift never guessed was that the real Tash would turn up; soGinger came out really frightened. And after that, Shift would send in anyone he wantedto get rid of and the sentry would kill them.

And -"

"Friend," said Tirian softly, "you hinder the lady in her tale."

"Well," said Lucy, "the sentry was surprised. That gave the other man just time to get onguard. They had a fight. He killed the sentry and flung him outside the door. Then hecame walking slowly forward to where we were. He could see us, and everything else.

We tried to talk to him but he was rather like a man in a trance. He kept on saying Tash,Tash, where is Tash? I go to Tash. So we gave it up and he went away somewhere - overthere. I liked him. And after that ... ugh!" Lucy made a face.

"After that," said Edmund, "someone flung a monkey through the door. And Tash wasthere again. My sister is so tender-hearted she doesn't like to tell you that Tash made onepeck and the Monkey was gone!"

"Serve him right!" said Eustace. "All the same, I hope he'll disagree with Tash too."

"And after that," said Edmund, "came about a dozen Dwarfs: and then Jill, and Eustace,and last of all yourself."

"I hope Tash ate the Dwarfs too," said Eustace. "Little swine."

"No, he didn't," said Lucy. "And don't be horrid. Thery're still here. In fact you can seethem from here. And I've tried and tried to make friends with them but it's no use."

"Friends with them!" cried Eustace. "If you knew how those Dwarfs have beenbehaving!"

"Oh stop it, Eustace," said Lucy. "Do come and see them. King Tirian, perhaps you coulddo something with them."

"I can feel no great love for Dwarfs today," said Tirian. "Yet at your asking, Lady, Iwould do a greater thing than this."

Lucy led the way and soon they could all see the Dwarfs. They had a very odd look. Theyweren't strolling about or enjoying themselves (although the cords with which they hadbeen tied seemed to have vanished) nor were they lying down and having a rest. Theywere sitting very close together in a little circle facing one another. They never lookedround or took any notice of the humans till Lucy and Tirian were almost near enough totouch them. Then the Dwarfs all cocked their heads as if they couldn't see anyone butwere listening hard and trying to guess by the sound what was happening.

"Look out!" said one of them in a surly voice. "Mind where you're going. Don't walk intoour faces!"

"All right!" said Eustace indignantly. "We're not blind. We've got eyes in our heads."

"They must be darn good ones if you can see in here," said the same Dwarf whose namewas Diggle.

"In where?" asked Edmund.

"Why you bone-head, in here of course," said Diggle. "In this pitch-black, poky, smellylittle hole of a stable."

"Are you blind?" said Tirian.

"Ain't we all blind in the dark!" said Diggle.

"But it isn't dark, you poor stupid Dwarfs," said Lucy. "Can't you see? Look up! Lookround! Can't you see the sky and the trees and the flowers? Can't you see me?"

"How in the name of all Humbug can I see what ain't there? And how can I see you anymore than you can see me in this pitch darkness?"

"But I can see you," said Lucy. "I'll prove I can see you. You've got a pipe in yourmouth."

"Anyone that knows the smell of baccy could tell that," said Diggle.

"Oh the poor things! This is dreadful," said Lucy. Then she had an idea. She stopped andpicked some wild violets. "Listen, Dwarf," she said. "Even if your eyes are wrong,perhaps your nose is all right: can you smell that?" She leaned across and held the fresh,damp flowers to Diggle's ugly nose. But she had to jump back quickly in order to avoid ablow from his hard little fist.

"None of that!" he shouted. "How dare you! What do you mean by shoving a lot of filthystable-litter in my face? There was a thistle in it too. It's like your sauce! And who areyou anyway?"

"Earth-man," said Tirian, "she is the Queen Lucy, sent hither by Aslan out of the deeppast. And it is for her sake alone that I, Tirian your lawful King, do not cut all your headsfrom your shoulders, proved and twice-proved traitors that you are."

"Well if that doesn't beat everything!" exclaimed Diggle. "How can you go on talking allthat rot? Your wonderful Lion didn't come and help you, did he? Thought not. And now -

even now - when you've been beaten and shoved into this black hole, just the same as therest of us, you're still at your old game. Starting a new lie! Trying to make us believewe're none of us shut up, and it ain't dark, and heaven knows what."

"There is no black hole, save in your own fancy, fool," cried Tirian. "Come out of it."And, leaning forward, he caught Diggle by the belt and the hood and swung him right outof the circle of Dwarfs. But the moment Tirian put him down, Diggle darted back to hisplace among the others, rubbing his nose and howling:

"Ow! Ow! What d'you do that for! Banging my face against the wall. You've nearlybroken my nose."

"Oh dear!" said Lucy, "What are we to do for them?"

"Let 'em alone," said Eustace: but as he spoke the earth trembled. The sweet air grewsuddenly sweeter. A brightness flashed behind them. All turned. Tirian turned lastbecause he was afraid. There stood his heart's desire, huge and real, the golden Lion,Aslan himself, and already the others were kneeling in a circle round his forepaws andburying their hands and faces in his mane as he stooped his great head to touch them withhis tongue. Then he fixed his eyes upon Tirian, and Tirian came near, trembling, andflung himself at the Lion's feet, and the Lion kissed him and said, "Well done, last of theKings of Narnia who stood firm at the darkest hour."

"Aslan," said Lucy through her tears, "could you - will you - do something for these poorDwarfs?"

"Dearest," said Aslan, "I will show you both what I can, and what I cannot, do." He cameclose to the Dwarfs and gave a low growl: low, but it set all the air shaking. But theDwarfs said to one another, "Hear that? That's the gang at the other end of the stable.

Trying to frighten us. They do it with a machine of some kind. Don't take any notice.

They won't take us in again!"

Aslan raised his head and shook his mane. Instantly a glorious feast appeared on theDwarfs' knees: pies and tongues and pigeons and trifles and ices, and each Dwarf had agoblet of good wine in his right hand. But it wasn't much use. They began eating anddrinking greedily enough, but it was clear that they couldn't taste it properly. Theythought they were eating and drinking only the sort of things you might find in a stable.

One said he was trying to eat hay and another said he had a bit of an old turnip and a thirdsaid he'd found a raw cabbage leaf. And they raised golden goblets of rich red wine totheir lips and said "Ugh! Fancy drinking dirty water out of a trough that a donkey's beenat! Never thought we'd come to this." But very soon every Dwarf began suspecting thatevery other Dwarf had found something nicer than he had, and they started grabbing andsnatching, and went on to quarrelling, till in a few minutes there was a free fight and allthe good food was smeared on their faces and clothes or trodden under foot. But when atlast they sat down to nurse their black eyes and their bleeding noses, they all said:

"Well, at any rate there's no Humbug here. We haven't let anyone take us in. The Dwarfsare for the Dwarfs."

"You see, " said Aslan. "They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunninginstead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; andso afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out. But come, children. I have otherwork to do."

He went to the Door and they all followed him. He raised his head and roared, "Now it istime!" then louder, "Time!"; then so loud that it could have shaken the stars, "TIME."The Door flew open.
