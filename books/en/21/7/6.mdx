title: CHAPTER 6. A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK
---

ABOUT four hours later Tirian flung himself into one of the bunks to snatch a littlesleep. The two children were already snoring: he had made them go to bed before he didbecause they would have to be up most of the night and he knew that at their age theycouldn't do without sleep. Also, he had tired them out. First he had given Jill somepractice in archery and found that, though not up to Narnian standards, she was really nottoo bad. Indeed she had succeeded in shooting a rabbit (not a Talking rabbit, of course:there are lots of the ordinary kind about in Western Narnia) and it was already skinned,cleaned, and hanging up. He had found that both the children knew all about this chillyand smelly job; they had learned that kind of thing on their great journey through Giant-

Land in the days of Prince Rilian. Then he had tried to teach Eustace how to use hissword and shield. Eustace had learned quite a lot about sword fighting on his earlieradventures but that had been all with a straight Narnian sword. He had never handled acurved Calormene scimitar and that made it hard, for many of the strokes are quitedifferent and some of the habits he had learned with the long sword had now to beunlearned again. But Tirian found that he had a good eye and was very quick on his feet.

He was surprised at the strength of both children: in fact they both seemed to be alreadymuch stronger and bigger and more grown-up than they had been when he first met thema few hours ago. It is one of the effects which Narnian air often has on visitors from ourworld.

All three of them agreed that the very first thing they must do was to go back to StableHill and try to rescue Jewel the Unicorn. After that, if they succeeded, they would try toget away Eastward and meet the little army which Roonwit the Centaur would bebringing from Cair Paravel.

An experienced warrior and huntsman like Tirian can always wake up at the time hewants. So he gave himself till nine o'clock that night and then put all worries out of hishead and fell asleep at once. It seemed only a moment later when he woke but he knewby the light and the very feel of things that he had timed his sleep exactly. He got up, puton his helmet-and-turban (he had slept in his mail shirt), and then shook the other two tillthey woke up. They looked, to tell the truth, very grey and dismal as they climbed out oftheir bunks and there was a good deal of yawning.

"Now," said Tirian, "we go due North from here - by good fortune 'tis a starry night - andit will be much shorter than our journey this morning, for then we went round-about butnow we shall go straight. If we are challenged, then do you two hold your peace and Iwill do my best to talk like a curst, cruel, proud lord of Calormen. If I draw my swordthen thou, Eustace, must do likewise and let Jill leap behind us and stand with an arrowon the string. But if I cry `Home', then fly for the Tower both of you. And let none try tofight on - not even one stroke after I have given the retreat: such false valour has spoiledmany notable plans in the wars. And now, friends, in the name of Aslan let us goforward."

Out they went into the cold night. All the great Northern stars were burning above thetree-tops. The North-Star of that world is called the Spear-Head: it is brighter than ourPole Star.

For a time they could go straight towards the Spear-Head but presently they came to adense thicket so that they had to go out of their course to get round it. And after that -forthey were still overshadowed by branches - it was hard to pick up their bearings. It wasJill who set them right again: she had been an excellent Guide in England. And of courseshe knew her Narnian stars perfectly, having travelled so much in the wild NorthernLands, and could work out the direction from other stars even when the Spear-Head washidden. As soon as Tirian saw that she was the best pathfinder of the three of them he puther in front. And then he was astonished to find how silently and almost invisibly sheglided on before them.

"By the Mane!" he whispered to Eustace. "This girl is a wondrous wood-maid. If she hadDryad's blood in her she could scarce do it better."

"She's so small, that's what helps," whispered Eustace. But Jill from in front said: "S-s-s-

h, less noise."

All round them the wood was very quiet. Indeed it was far too quiet. On an ordinaryNarnia night there ought to have been noises - an occasional cheery "Goodnight" from aHedgehog, the cry of an Owl overhead, perhaps a flute in the distance to tell of Faunsdancing, or some throbbing, hammering noises from Dwarfs underground. All that wassilenced: gloom and fear reigned over Narnia.

After a time they began to go steeply uphill and the trees grew further apart. Tirian coulddimly make out the wellknown hill-top and the stable. Jill was now going with more andmore caution: she kept on making signs to the others with her hand to do the same. Thenshe stopped dead still and Tirian saw her gradually sink down into the grass anddisappear without a sound. A moment later she rose again, put her mouth close to Tirian'sear, and said in the lowest possible whisper, "Get down. Thee better." She said thee forsee not because she had a lisp but because she knew the hissing letter S is the part of awhisper most likely to be overheard. Tirian at once lay down, almost as silently as Jill,but not quite, for he was heavier and older. And once they were down, he saw how fromthat position you could see the edge of the hill sharp against the star-strewn sky. Twoblack shapes rose against it: one was the stable, and the other, a few feet in front of it,was a Calormene sentry. He was keeping very ill watch: not walking or even standing butsitting with his spear over his shoulder and his chin on his chest. "Well done," said Tirianto Jill. She had shown him exactly what he needed to know.

They got up and Tirian now took the lead. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, theymade their way up to a little clump of trees which was not more than forty feet away fromthe sentinel.

"Wait here till I come again," he whispered to the other two. "If I miscarry, fly." Then hesauntered out boldly in full view of the enemy. The man started when he saw him andwas just going to jump to his feet: he was afraid Tirian might be one of his own officersand that he would get into trouble for sitting down. But before he could get up Tirian haddropped on one knee beside him, saying:

"Art thou a warrior of the Tisroc's, may he live for ever? It cheers my heart to meet theeamong all these beasts and devils of Narnians. Give me thy hand, friend."

Before he well knew what was happening the Calormene sentry found his right handseized in a mighty grip. Next instant someone was kneeling on his legs and a dagger waspressed against his neck.

"One noise and thou art dead," said Tirian in his ear. "Tell me where the Unicorn is andthou shalt live."

"B - behind the stable, O My Master," stammered the unfortunate man.

"Good. Rise up and lead me to him."

As the man got up the point of the dagger never left his neck. It only travelled round(cold and rather ticklish) as Tirian got behind him and settled it at a convenient placeunder his ear. Trembling he went round to the back of the stable.

Though it was dark Tirian could see the white shape of Jewel at once.

"Hush!" he said. "No, do not neigh. Yes, Jewel, it is I. How have they tied thee?"

"Hobbled by all four legs and tied with a bridle to a ring in the stable wall," came Jewel'svoice.

"Stand here, sentry, with your back to the wall. So. Now, Jewel: set the point of yourhorn against this Calormene's breast."

"With a good will, Sire," said Jewel.

"If he moves, rive him to the heart." Then in a few seconds Tirian cut the ropes. With theremains of them he bound the sentry hand and foot. Finally he made him open his mouth,stuffed it full of grass and tied him up from scalp to chin so that he could make no noise,lowered the man into a sitting position and set him against the wall.

"I have done thee some discourtesy, soldier," said Tirian. "But such was my need. If wemeet again I may happen to do thee a better turn. Now, Jewel, let us go softly."

He put his left arm round the beast's neck and bent and kissed its nose and both had greatjoy. They went back as quietly as possible to the place where he had left the children. Itwas darker in there under the trees and he nearly ran into Eustace before he saw him.

"All's well," whispered Tirian. "A good night's work. Now for home."

They turned and had gone a few paces when Eustace said, "Where are you, Pole?" Therewas no answer. "Is Jill on the other side of you, Sire?" he asked.

"What?" said Tirian. "Is she not on the other side of your"

It was a terrible moment. They dared not shout but they whispered her name in theloudest whisper they could manage. There was no reply.

"Did she go from you while I was away?" asked Tirian.

"I didn't see or hear her go," said Eustace. "But she could have gone without myknowing. She can be as quiet as a cat; you've seen for yourself."

At that moment a far off drum beat was heard. Jewel moved his ears forward. "Dwarfs,"he said.

"And treacherous Dwarfs, enemies, as likely as not," muttered Tirian.

"And here comes something on hoofs, much nearer," said Jewel.

The two humans and the Unicorn stood dead still. There were now so many differentthings to worry about that they didn't know what to do. The noise of hoofs came steadilynearer. And then, quite close to them, a voice whispered:

"Hallo! Are you all there?"

Thank heaven, it was Jill's.

"Where the devil have you been to?" said Eustace in a furious whisper, for he had beenvery frightened.

"In the stable," gasped Jill, but it was the sort of gasp you give when you're strugglingwith suppressed laughter.

"Oh," growled Eustace, "you think it funny, do you? Well all I can say is -"

"Have you got Jewel, Sire?" asked Jill.

"Yes. Here he is. What is that beast with you?"

"That's him," said Jill. "But let's be off home before anyone wakes up." And again therecame little explosions of laughter.

The others obeyed at once for they had already lingered long enough in that dangerousplace and the Dwarf drums seemed to have come a little nearer. It was only after they hadbeen walking Southward for several minutes that Eustace said:

"Got him? What do you mean?"

"The false Aslan," said Jill.

"What?" said Tirian. "Where have you been? What have you done?"

"Well, Sire," said Jill. "As soon as I saw that you'd got the sentry out of the way I thoughthadn't I better have a look inside the stable and see what really is there? So I crawledalong. It was as easy as anything to draw the bolt.

Of course it was pitch black inside and smelled like any other stable. Then I struck a lightand - would you believe it? - there was nothing at all there but this old donkey with abundle of lion-skin tied on to his back. So I drew my knife and told him he'd have tocome along with me. As a matter of fact I needn't have threatened him with the knife atall. He was very fed up with the stable and quite ready to come - weren't you, Puzzledear?"

"Great Scott!" said Eustace. "Well I'm - jiggered. I was jolly angry with you a momentago, and I still think it was mean of you to sneak off without the rest of us: but I mustadmit - well, I mean to say - well it was a perfectly gorgeous thing to do. If she was a boyshe'd have to be knighted, wouldn't she, Sire?"

"If she was a boy," said Tirian, "she'd be whipped for disobeying orders." And in the darkno one could see whether he said this with a frown or a smile. Next minute there was asound of rasping metal.

"What are you doing, Sire?" asked Jewel sharply.

"Drawing my sword to smite off the head of the accursed Ass," said Tirian in a terriblevoice. "Stand clear, girl."

"Oh don't, please don't," said Jill. "Really, you mustn't. It wasn't his fault. It was all theApe. He didn't know any better. And he's very sorry. And he's a nice Donkey. His name'sPuzzle. And I've got my arms round his neck."

"Jill," said Tirian, "you are the bravest and most woodwise of all my subjects, but also themost malapert and disobedient. Well: let the Ass live. What have you to say for yourself,Ass?"

"Me, Sire?" came the Donkey's voice. "I'm sure I'm very sorry if I've done wrong. TheApe said Aslan wanted me to dress up like that. And I thought he'd know. I'm not cleverlike him. I only did what I was told. It wasn't any fun for me living in that stable. I don'teven know what's been going on outside. He never let me out except for a minute or twoat night. Some days they forgot to give me any water too."

"Sire," said Jewel. "Those Dwarfs are coming nearer and nearer. Do we want to meetthem?"

Tirian thought for a moment and then suddenly gave a great laugh out loud. Then hespoke, not this time in a whisper. "By the Lion," he said, "I am growing slow witted!

Meet them? Certainly we will meet them. We will meet anyone now. We have this Ass toshow them. Let them see the thing they have feared and bowed to. We can show them thetruth of the Ape's vile plot. His secret's out. The tide's turned. Tomorrow we shall hangthat Ape on the highest tree in Narnia. No more whispering and skulking and disguises.

Where are these honest Dwarfs? We have good news for them."

When you have been whispering for hours the mere sound of anyone talking out loud hasa wonderfully stirring effect. The whole party began talking and laughing: even Puzzlelifted up his head and gave a grand Haw-hee-haw-hee-hee; a thing the Ape hadn't allowedhim to do for days. Then they set off in the direction of the drumming. It grew steadilylouder and soon they could see torchlight as well. They came out on one of those roughroads (we should hardly call them roads at all in England) which ran through LanternWaste. And there, marching sturdily along, were about thirty Dwarfs, all with their littlespades and mattocks over their shoulders. Two armed Calormenes led the column andtwo more brought up the rear.

"Stay!" thundered Tirian as he stepped out on the road. "Stay, soldiers. Whither do youlead these Narnian Dwarfs and by whose orders?"
