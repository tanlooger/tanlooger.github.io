title: CHAPTER 10. WHO WILL GO INTO THE STABLE?
---

JILL felt something tickling her ear. It was Jewel the Unicorn, whispering to her with thewide whisper of a horse's mouth. As soon as she heard what he was saying she noddedand tip-toed back to where Puzzle was standing. Quickly and quietly she cut the lastcords that bound the lion-skin to him. It wouldn't do for him to be caught with that on,after what the Ape had said! She would like to have hidden the skin somewhere very faraway, but it was too heavy. The best she could do was to kick it in among the thickestbushes. Then she made signs to Puzzle to follow her and they both joined the others.

The Ape was speaking again.

"And after a horrid thing like that, Aslan - Tashlan - is angrier than ever. He says he'sbeen a great deal too good to you, coming out every night to be looked at, see! Well, he'snot coming out any more."

Howls and mewings and squeals and grunts were the Animals' answer to this, butsuddenly a quite different voice broke in with a loud laugh.

"Hark what the monkey says," it shouted. "We know why he isn't going to bring hisprecious Aslan out. I'll tell you why: because he hasn't got him. He never had anythingexcept an old donkey with a lion-skin on its back. Now he's lost that and he doesn't knowwhat to do."

Tirian could not see the faces on the other side of the fire very well but he guessed thiswas Griffle the Chief Dwarf. And he was quite certain of it when, a second later, all theDwarfs' voices joined in, singing: "Don't know what to do! Don't know what to do! Don'tknow what to do-o-o!"

"Silence!" thundered Rishda Tarkaan. "Silence, children of mud! Listen to me, you otherNarnians, lest I give command to my warriors to fall upon you with the edge of thesword. The Lord Shift has already told you of that wicked Ass. Do you think, because ofhim that there is no real Tashlan in the stable! Do you? Beware, beware."

"No, no," shouted most of the crowd. But the Dwarfs said, "That's right, Darkie, you'vegot it. Come on, Monkey, show us what's in the stable, seeing is believing."

When next there was a moment's quiet the Ape said: "You Dwarfs think you're veryclever, don't you? But not so fast. I never said you couldn't see Tashlan. Anyone wholikes can see him."

The whole assembly became silent. Then, after nearly a minute, the Bear began in a slow,puzzled voice:

"I don't quite understand all this," it grumbled, "I thought you said -"

"You thought!" repeated the Ape. "As if anyone could call what goes on in your headthinking. Listen, you others. Anyone can see Tashlan. But he's not coming out. You haveto go in and see him."

"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you," said dozens of voices. "That's what we wanted!

We can go in and see him face to face. And now he'll be kind and it will all be as it usedto be." And the Birds chattered, and the Dogs barked excitedly. Then suddenly, there wasa great stirring and a noise of creatures rising to their feet, and in a second the whole lotof them would have been rushing forward and trying to crowd into the stable door alltogether. But the Ape shouted:

"Get back! Quiet! Not so fast."

The Beasts stopped, many of them with one paw in the with tails wagging, and all ofthem with heads on one side.

"I thought you said," began the Bear, but Shift interrupted.

"Anyone can go in," he said. "But, one at a time. Who'll go first? He didn't say he wasfeeling very kind. He's been licking his lips a lot since he swallowed up the wicked Kingthe other night. He's been growling a good deal this morning. I wouldn't much like to gointo that stable myself tonight. But just as you please. Who'd like to go in first? Don'tblame me if he swallows you whole or blasts you into a cinder with the mere terror of hiseyes. That's your affair. Now then! Who's first? What about one of you Dwarfs?"

"Dilly, dilly, come and be killed!" sneered Griffle. "How do we know what you've got inthere?"

"Ho-ho!" cried the Ape. "So you're beginning to think there's something there, eh? Well,all you Beasts were making noise enough a minute ago. What's struck you all dumb?

Who's going in first?"

But the Beasts all stood looking at one another and began backing away from the stable.

Very few tails were wagging now. The Ape waddled to and fro jeering at them. "Ho-ho-

ho!" he chuckled. "I thought you were all so eager to see Tashlan face to face! Changedyour mind, eh?"

Tirian bent his head to hear something that Jill was trying to whisper in his ear. "What doyou think is really inside the stable?" she said. "Who knows?" said Tirian. "TwoCalormenes with drawn swords, as likely as not, one on each side of the door." "Youdon't think," said Jill, "it might be . . . you know . . . that horrid thing we saw?" "Tashhimself?" whispered Tirian. "There's no knowing. But courage, child: we are all betweenthe paws of the true Aslan."

Then a most surprising thing happened. Ginger the Cat said in a cool, clear voice, not atall as if he was excited, "I'll go in, if you like."

Every creature turned and fixed its eyes on the Cat. "Mark their subtleties, Sire," saidPoggin to the King. "This cursed cat is in the plot, in the very centre of it. Whatever is inthe stable will not hurt him, I'll be bound. Then Ginger will come out again and say thathe has seen some wonder."

But Tirian had no time to answer him. The Ape was calling the Cat to come forward.

"Ho-ho!" said the Ape. "So you, a pert Puss, would look upon him face to face. Come on,then! I'll open the door for you. Don't blame me if he scares the whiskers off your face.

That's your affair."

And the Cat got up and came out of its place in the crowd, walking primly and daintily,with its tail in the air, not one hair on its sleek coat out of place. It came on till it hadpassed the fire and was so close that Tirian, from where he stood with his shoulderagainst the end-wall of the stable, could look right into its face. Its big green eyes neverblinked. ("Cool as a cucumber," muttered Eustace. "It knows it has nothing to fear.") TheApe, chuckling and making faces, shuttled across beside the Cat: put up his paw: drew

the bolt and opened the door. Tirian thought he could hear the Cat purring as it walkedinto the dark doorway.

"Aii-aii-aouwee! -" The most horrible caterwaul you ever heard made everyone jump.

You have been wakened yourself by cats quarrelling or making love on the roof in themiddle of the night: you know the sound.

This was worse. The Ape was knocked head over heels by Ginger coming back out of thestable at top speed. If you had not known he was a cat, you might have thought he was aginger-coloured streak of lightning. He shot across the open grass, back into the crowd.

No one wants to meet a cat in that state. You could see animals getting out of his way toleft and right. He dashed up a tree, whisked around, and hung head downwards. His tailwas bristled out till it was nearly as thick as his whole body: his eyes were like saucers ofgreen fire: along his back every single hair stood on end.

"I'd give my beard," whispered Poggin, "to know whether that brute is only acting orwhether it has really found something in there that frightened it!"

"Peace, friend," said Tirian, for the Captain and the Ape were also whispering and hewanted to hear what they said. He did not succeed, except that he heard the Ape oncemore whimpering "My head, my head," but he got the idea that those two were almost aspuzzled by the cat's behaviour as himself.

"Now, Ginger," said the Captain. "Enough of that noise. Tell them what thou hast seen."

"Aii - Aii - Aaow - Awah," screamed the Cat.

"Art thou not called a Talking Beast?" said the Captain. "Then hold thy devilish noise andtalk."

What followed was rather horrible. Tirian felt quite certain (and so did the others) that theCat was trying to say something: but nothing came out of his mouth except the ordinary,ugly cat-noises you might hear from any angry or frightened old Tom in a backyard inEngland. And the longer he caterwauled the less like a Talking Beast he looked. Uneasywhimperings and little sharp squeals broke out from among the other Animals.

"Look, look!" said the voice of the Bear. "It can't talk. It has forgotten how to talk! It hasgone back to being a dumb beast. Look at its face." Everyone saw that it was true. Andthen the greatest terror of all fell upon those Narnians. For every one of them had beentaught - when it was only a chick or a puppy or a cub - how Aslan at the beginning of theworld had turned the beasts of Narnia into Talking Beasts and warned them that if theyweren't good they might one day be turned back again and be like the poor witlessanimals one meets in other countries. "And now it is coming upon us," they moaned.

"Mercy! Mercy!" wailed the Beasts. "Spare us, Lord Shift, stand between us and Aslan,you must always go in and speak to him for us. We daren't, we daren't."

Ginger disappeared further up into the tree. No one ever saw him again.

Tirian stood with his hand on his sword-hilt and his head bowed. He was dazed with thehorrors of that night. Sometimes he thought it would be best to draw his sword at onceand rush upon the Calormenes: then next moment he thought it would be better to waitand see what new turn affairs might take. And now a new turn came.

"My Father," came a clear, ringing voice from the left of the crowd. Tirian knew at oncethat it was one of the Calormenes speaking, for in The Tisroc's army the common soldierscall the officers "My Master" but the officers call their senior officers "My Father". Jilland Eustace didn't know this but, after looking this way and that, they saw the speaker,for of course people at the sides of the crowd were easier to see than people in the middlewhere the glare of the fire made all beyond it look rather black. He was young and talland slender, and even rather beautiful in the dark, haughty, Calormene way.

"My Father," he said to the Captain, "I also desire to go in."

"Peace, Emeth," said the Captain, "Who called thee to counsel? Does it become a boy tospeak?"

"My Father," said Emeth. "Truly I am younger than thou, yet I also am of the blood of theTarkaans even as thou art, and I also am the servant of Tash. Therefore . . ."

"Silence," said Rishda Tarkaan. "Am not I thy Captain? Thou hast nothing to do with thisstable. It is for the Narnians."

"Nay, my Father," answered Emeth. "Thou hast said that their Aslan and our Tash are allone. And if that is the truth, then Tash himself is in yonder. And how then sayest thouthat I have nothing to do with him? For gladly would I die a thousand deaths if I mightlook once on the face of Tash."

"Thou art a fool and understandest nothing," said Rishda Tarkaan. "These be highmatters."

Emeth's face grew sterner. "Is it then not true that Tash and Aslan are all one?" he asked.

"Has the Ape lied to us?"

"Of course they're all one," said the Ape.

"Swear it, Ape," said Emeth.

"Oh dear!" whimpered Shift, "I wish you'd all stop bothering me. My head does ache.

Yes, yes, I swear it."

"Then, my Father," said Emeth, "I am utterly determined to go in."

"Fool," began Rishda Tarkaan, but at once the Dwarfs began shouting: "Come along,Darkie. Why don't you let him in? Why do you let Narnians in and keep your own peopleout? What have you got in there that you don't want your own men to meet?"

Tirian and his friends could only see the back of Rishda Tarkaan, so they never knewwhat his face looked like as he shrugged his shoulders and said, "Bear witness all that Iam guiltless of this young fool's blood. Get thee in, rash boy, and make haste."

Then, just as Ginger had done, Emeth came walking forward into the open strip of grassbetween the bonfire and the stable. His eyes were shining, his face very solemn, his handwas on his sword-hilt, and he carried his head high. Jill felt like crying when she lookedat his face. And Jewel whispered in the King's ear, "By the Lion's Mane, I almost lovethis young warrior, Calormene though he be. He is worthy of a better god than Tash."

"I do wish we knew what is really inside there," said Eustace.

Emeth opened the door and went in, into the black mouth of the stable. He closed thedoor behind him. Only a few moments passed - but it seemed longer before the dooropened again. A figure in Calormene armour reeled out, fell on its back, and lay still: thedoor closed behind it. The Captain leaped towards it and bent down to stare at its face. Hegave a start of surprise. Then he recovered himself and turned to the crowd, crying out:

"The rash boy has had his will. He has looked on Tash and is dead. Take warning, all ofyou."

"We will, we will," said the poor Beasts. But Tirian and his friends stared at the deadCalormene and then at one another. For they, being so close, could see what the crowd,being further off and beyond the fire, could not see: this dead man was not Emeth. Hewas quite different: an older man, thicker and not so tall, with a big beard.

"Ho-ho-ho," chuckled the Ape. "Any more? Anyone else want to go in? Well, as you'reall shy, I'll choose the next. You, you Boar! On you come. Drive him up, Calormenes. Heshall see Tashlan face to face."

"O-o-mph," grunted the Boar, rising heavily to his feet. "Come on, then. Try my tusks."

When Tirian saw that brave Beast getting ready to fight for its life - and Calormenesoldiers beginning to close in on it with their drawn scimitars - and no one going to itshelp - something seemed to burst inside him. He no longer cared if this was the bestmoment to interfere or not.

"Swords out," he whispered to the others. "Arrow on string. Follow."

Next moment the astonished Narnians saw seven figures leap forth in front of the stable,four of them in shining mail. The King's sword flashed in the firelight as he waved itabove his head and cried in a great voice:

"Here stand I, Tirian of Narnia, in Aslan's name, to prove with my body that Tash is afoul fiend, the Ape a manifold traitor, and these Calormenes worthy of death. To my side,all true Narnians. Would you wait till your new masters have killed you all one by one?"
