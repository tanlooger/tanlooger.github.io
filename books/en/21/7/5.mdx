title: CHAPTER 5. HOW HELP CAME TO THE KING
---

Bur his misery did not last long. Almost at once there came a bump, and then a secondbump, and two children were standing before him. The wood in front of him had beenquite empty a second before and he knew they had not come from behind his tree, for hewould have heard them. They had in fact simply appeared from nowhere. He saw at aglance that they were wearing the same queer, dingy sort of clothes as the people in his

dream; and he saw, at a second glance, that they were the youngest boy and girl out ofthat party of seven.

"Gosh!" said the boy, "that took one's breath away! I thought -"

"Hurry up and get him untied," said the girl. "We can talk, afterwards." Then she added,turning to Tirian, "I'm sorry we've been so long. We came the moment we could."

While she was speaking the Boy produced a knife from his pocket and was quicklycutting the King's bonds: too quickly, in fact, for the King was so stiff and numb thatwhen the last cord was cut he fell forward on his hands and knees. He couldn't get upagain till he had brought some life back into his legs by a good rubbing.

"I say," said the girl. "It was you, wasn't it, who appeared to us that night when we wereall at supper? Nearly a week ago."

"A week, fair maid?" said Tirian. "My dream led me into your world scarce ten minutessince."

"It's the usual muddle about times, Pole," said the Boy.

"I remember now," said Tirian. "That too comes in all the old tales. The time of yourstrange land is different from ours. But if we speak of Time, 'tis time to be gone fromhere: for my enemies are close at hand. Will you come with me?"

"Of course," said the girl. "It's you we've come to help."

Tirian got to his feet and led them rapidly down hill, Southward and away from thestable. He knew where he meant to go but his first aim was to get to rocky places wherethey would leave no trail, and his second to cross some water so that they would leave noscent. This took them about an hour's scrambling and wading and while that was goingon nobody had any breath to talk. But even so, Tirian kept on stealing glances at hiscompanions. The wonder of walking beside the creatures from another world made himfeel a little dizzy: but it also made all the old stories seem far more real than they hadever seemed before . . . anything might happen now.

"Now," said Tirian as they came to the head of a little valley which ran down before themamong young birch trees, "we are out of danger of those villains for a space and maywalk more easily." The sun had risen, dew-drops were twinkling on every branch, andbirds were singing.

"What about some grub? - I mean for you, Sir, we two have had our breakfast," said theBoy.

Tirian wondered very much what he meant by "grub", but when the Boy opened a bulgysatchel which he was carrying and pulled out a rather greasy and squashy packet, heunderstood. He was ravenously hungry, though he hadn't thought about it till thatmoment. There were two hard-boiled egg sandwiches, and two cheese sandwiches, andtwo with some kind of paste in them. If he hadn't been so hungry he wouldn't havethought much of the paste, for that is a sort of food nobody eats in Narnia. By the time hehad eaten all six sandwiches they had come to the bottom of the valley and there theyfound a mossy cliff with a little fountain bubbling out of it. All three stopped and drankand splashed their hot faces.

"And now," said the girl as she tossed her wet hair back from her forehead, "aren't yougoing to tell us who you are and why you were tied up and what it's all about?"

"With a good will, damsel," said Tirian. "But we must keep on the march." So while theywent on walking he told them who he was and all the things that had happened to him.

"And now," he said at the end, "I am going to a certain tower, one of three that were builtin my grandsire's time to guard Lantern Waste against certain perilous outlaws whodwelled there in his day. By Aslan's good will I was not robbed of my keys. In that towerwe shall find stores of weapons and mail and some victuals also, though no better thandry biscuit. There also we can lie safe while we make our plans. And now, prithee, tellme who you two are and all your story."

"I'm Eustace Scrubb and this is Jill Pole," said the Boy. "And we were here once before,ages and ages ago, more than a year ago by our time, and there was a chap called PrinceRilian, and they were keeping this chap underground, and Puddleglum put his foot in -"

"Ha!" cried Tirian, "are you then that Eustace and that Jill who rescued King Rilian fromhis long enchantment?"

"Yes, that's us," said Jill. "So he's King Rilian now, is he? Oh of course he would be. Iforgot-"

"Nay," said Tirian, "I am the seventh in descent from him. He has been dead over twohundred years."

Jill made a face. "Ugh!" she said. "That's the horrid part about coming back to Narnia."But Eustace went on.

"Well now you know who we are, Sire," he said. "And it was like this. The Professor andAunt Polly had got all us friends of Narnia together -"

"I know not these names, Eustace," said Tirian.

"They're the two who came into Narnia at the very beginning, the day all the animalslearned to talk."

"By the Lion's Mane," cried Tirian. "Those two! The Lord Digory and the Lady Polly!

From the dawn of the world! And still in your place? The wonder and the glory of it! Buttell me, tell me."

"She isn't really our aunt, you know," said Eustace. "She's Miss Plummer, but we call herAunt Polly. Well those two got us all together partly just for fun, so that we could allhave a good jaw about Narnia (for of course there's no one else we can ever talk to aboutthings like that) but partly because the Professor had a feeling that we were somehowwanted over here. Well then you came in like a ghost or goodness-knows-what andnearly frightened the lives out of us and vanished without saying a word. After that, weknew for certain there was something up.

The next question was how to get here. You can't go just by wanting to. So we talked andtalked and at last the Professor said the only way would be by the Magic Rings. It was bythose Rings that he and Aunt Polly got here long, long ago when they were only kids,years before we younger ones were born. But the Rings had all been buried in the gardenof a house in London (that's our big town, Sire) and the house had been sold. So then theproblem was how to get at them. You'll never guess what we did in the end! Peter andEdmund - that's the High King Peter, the one who spoke to you - went up to London toget into the garden from the back, early in the morning before people were up. They weredressed like workmen so that if anyone did see them it would look as if they'd come to dosomething about the drains. I wish I'd been with them: it must have been glorious fun.

And they must have succeeded for next day Peter sent us a wire - that's a sort of message,Sire, I'll explain about it some other time - to say he'd got the Rings. And the day afterthat was the day Pole and I had to go back to school - we're the only two who are still atschool and we're at the same one. So Peter and Edmund were to meet us at a place on theway down to school and hand over the Rings. It had to be us two who were to go toNarnia, you see, because the older ones couldn't come again. So we got into the trainthat's a kind of thing people travel in in our world: a lot of wagons chained together - andthe Professor and Aunt Polly and Lucy came with us. We wanted to keep together as longas we could. Well there we were in the train. And we were just getting to the stationwhere the others were to meet us, and I was looking out of the window to see if I couldsee them when suddenly there came a most frightful jerk and a noise: and there we werein Narnia and there was your Majesty tied up to the tree."

"So you never used the Rings?" said Tirian.

"No," said Eustace. "Never even saw them. Aslan did it all for us in his own way withoutany Rings."

"But the High King Peter has them," said Tirian.

"Yes," said Jill. "But we don't think he can use them. When the two other Pevensies -

King Edmund and Queen Lucy - were last here, Aslan said they would never come toNarnia again. And he said something of the same sort to the High King, only longer ago.

You may be sure he'll come like a shot if he's allowed."

"Gosh!" said Eustace. "It's getting hot in this sun. Are we nearly there, Sire?"

"Look," said Tirian and pointed. Not many yards away grey battlements rose above thetree-tops, and after a minute's more walking they came out in an open grassy space. Astream ran across it and on the far side of the stream stood a squat, square tower withvery few and narrow windows and one heavy-looking door in the wall that faced them.

Tirian looked sharply this way and that to make sure that no enemies were in sight. Thenhe walked up to the tower and stood still for a moment fishing up his bunch of keyswhich he wore inside his hunting-dress on a narrow silver chain that went round his neck.

It was a nice bunch of keys that he brought out, for two were golden and many wererichly ornamented: you could see at once that they were keys made for opening solemnand secret rooms in palaces, or chests and caskets of sweet-smelling wood that containedroyal treasures. But the key which he now put into the lock of the door was big and plainand more rudely made. The lock was stiff and for a moment Tirian began to be afraid thathe would not be able to turn it: but at last he did and the door swung open with a sullencreak.

"Welcome friends," said Tirian. "I fear this is the best palace that the King of Narnia cannow offer to his guests."

Tirian was pleased to see that the two strangers had been well brought up. They both saidnot to mention it and that they were sure it would be very nice.

As a matter of fact it was not particularly nice. It was rather dark and smelled very damp.

There was only one room in it and this room went right up to the stone roof: a woodenstaircase in one corner led up to a trap door by which you could get out on thebattlements. There were a few rude bunks to sleep in, and a great many lockers andbundles. There was also a hearth which looked as if nobody had lit a fire in it for a greatmany years.

"We'd better go out and gather some firewood first thing, hadn't we?" said Jill.

"Not yet, comrade," said Tirian. He was determined that they should not be caughtunarmed, and began searching the lockers, thankfully remembering that he had alwaysbeen careful to have these garrison towers inspected once a year and to make sure thatthey were stocked with all things needful. The bow strings were there in their coveringsof oiled silk, the swords and spears were greased against rust, and the armour was keptbright in its wrappings. But there was something even better. "Look you!" said Tirian ashe drew out a long mail shirt of a curious pattern and flashed it before the children's eyes.

"That's funny-looking mail, Sire," said Eustace.

"Aye, lad," said Tirian. "No Narnian Dwarf smithied that. 'Tis mail of Calormen,outlandish gear. I have ever kept a few suits of it in readiness, for I never knew when I or

my friends might have reason to walk unseen in The Tisroc's land. And look on this stonebottle. In this there is a juice which, when we have rubbed it on our hands and faces, willmake us brown as Calormenes."

"Oh hurrah!" said Jill. "Disguise! I love disguises."

Tirian showed them how to pour out a little of the juice into the palms of their hands andthen rub it well over their faces and necks, right down to the shoulders, and then on theirhands, right up to the elbows. He did the same himself.

"After this has hardened on us," he said, "we may wash in water and it will not change.

Nothing but oil and ashes will make us white Narnians again. And now, sweet Jill, let usgo see how this mail shirt becomes you. 'Tis something too long, yet not so much as Ifeared. Doubtless it belonged to a page in the train of one of their Tarkaans."

After the mail shirts they put on Calormene helmets, which are little round ones fittingtight to the head and having a spike on top. Then Tirian took long rolls of some whitestuff out of the locker and wound them over the helmets till they became turbans: but thelittle steel spike still stuck up in the middle. He and Eustace took curved Calormeneswords and little round shields. There was no sword light enough for Jill, but he gave hera long, straight hunting knife which might do for a sword at a pinch.

"Hast any skill with the bow, maiden?" said Tirian.

"Nothing worth talking of," said Jill, blushing. "Scrubb's not bad."

"Don't you believe her, Sire," said Eustace. "We've both been practising archery eversince we got back from Narnia last time, and she's about as good as me now. Not thateither of us is much."

Then Tirian gave Jill a bow and a quiver full of arrows. The next business was to light afire, for inside that tower it still felt more like a cave than like anything indoors and setone shivering. But they got warm gathering wood - the sun was now at its highest - andonce the blaze was roaring up the chimney the place began to look cheerful. Dinner was,however, a dull meal, for the best they could do was to pound up some of the hard biscuitwhich they found in a locker and pour it into boiling water, with salt, so as to make a kindof porridge. And of course there was nothing to drink but water.

"I wish we'd brought a packet of tea," said Jill.

"Or a tin of cocoa," said Eustace.

"A firkin or so of good wine in each of these towers would not have been amiss," saidTirian.
