title: CHAPTER 2. THE RASHNESS OF THE KING
---

About three weeks later the last of the Kings of Narnia sat under the great oak whichgrew beside the door of his little hunting lodge, where he often stayed for ten days or soin the pleasant spring weather. It was a low, thatched building not far from the Easternend of Lantern Waste and some way above the meeting of the two rivers. He loved to livethere simply and at ease, away from the state and pomp of Cair Paravel, the royal city.

His name was King Tirian, and he was between twenty and twenty-five years old; hisshoulders were already broad and strong and his limbs full of hard muscle, but his beardwas still scanty. He had blue eyes and a fearless, honest face.

There was no one with him that spring morning except his dearest friend, Jewel theUnicorn. They loved each other like brothers and each had saved the other's life in thewars. The lordly beast stood close beside the King's chair, with its neck bent roundpolishing its blue horn against the creamy whiteness of its flank.

"I cannot set myself to any work or sport today, Jewel," said the King. "I can think ofnothing but this wonderful news. Think you we shall hear any more of it today?"

"They are the most wonderful tidings ever heard in our days or our fathers' or ourgrandfathers' days, Sire," said Jewel, "if they are true."

"How can they choose but be true?" said the King. "It is more than a week ago that thefirst birds came flying over us saying, Aslan is here, Aslan has come to Narnia again.

And after that it was the squirrels. They had not seen him, but they said it was certain hewas in the woods. Then came the Stag. He said he had seen him with his own eyes, agreat way off, by moonlight, in Lantern Waste. Then came that dark Man with the beard,the merchant from Calormen. The Calormenes care nothing for Aslan as we do; but theman spoke of it as a thing beyond doubt. And there was the Badger last night; he too hadseen Aslan."

"Indeed, Sire," answered Jewel, "I believe it all. If I seem not to, it is only that my joy istoo great to let my belief settle itself. It is almost too beautiful to believe."

"Yes," said the King with a great sigh, almost a shiver, of delight. "It is beyond all that Iever hoped for in all my life."

"Listen!" said Jewel, putting his head on one side and cocking his ears forward.

"What is it?" asked the King.

"Hoofs, Sire," said Jewel. "A galloping horse. A very heavy horse. It must be one of theCentaurs. And look, there he is."

A great, golden bearded Centaur, with man's sweat on his forehead and horse's sweat onhis chestnut flanks, dashed up to the King, stopped, and bowed low. "Hail, King," it criedin a voice as deep as a bull's.

"Ho, there!" said the King, looking over his shoulder towards the door of the huntinglodge. "A bowl of wine for the noble Centaur. Welcome, Roonwit. When you have foundyour breath you shall tell us your errand."

A page came out of the house carrying a great wooden bowl, curiously carved, andhanded it to the Centaur. The Centaur raised the bowl and said,

"I drink first to Aslan and truth, Sire, and secondly to your Majesty."

He finished the wine (enough for six strong men) at one draught and handed the emptybowl back to the page.

"Now, Roonwit," said the King. "Do you bring us more news of Aslan?"

Roonwit looked very grave, frowning a little.

"Sire," he said. "You know how long I have lived and studied the stars; for we Centaurslive longer than you Men, and even longer than your kind, Unicorn. Never in all my dayshave I seen such terrible things written in the skies as there have been nightly since thisyear began. The stars say nothing of the coming of Aslan, nor of peace, nor of joy. Iknow by my art that there have not been such disastrous conjunctions of the planets forfive hundred years. It was already in my mind to come and warn your Majesty that somegreat evil hangs over Narnia. But last night the rumour reached me that Aslan is abroad inNarnia. Sire, do not believe this tale. It cannot be. The stars never lie, but Men and Beastsdo. If Aslan were really coming to Narnia the sky would have foretold it. If he werereally come, all the most gracious stars would be assembled in his honour. It is all a lie."

"A lie!" said the King fiercely. "What creature in Narnia or all the world would dare to lieon such a matter?" And, without knowing it, he laid his hand on his sword hilt.

"That I know not, Lord King," said the Centaur. "But I know there are liars on earth;there are none among the stars."

"I wonder," said Jewel, "whether Aslan might not come though all the stars foretoldotherwise. He is not the slave of the stars but their Maker. Is it not said in all the oldstories that He is not a tame lion."

"Well said, well said, Jewel," cried the King. "Those are the very words: not a tame lion.

It comes in many tales."

Roonwit had just raised his hand and was leaning forward to say something veryearnestly to the King when all three of them turned their heads to listen to a wailingsound that was quickly drawing nearer. The wood was so thick to the West of them thatthey could not see the newcomer yet. But they could soon hear the words.

"Woe, woe, woe!" called the voice. "Woe for my brothers and sisters! Woe for the holytrees! The woods are laid waste. The axe is loosed against us. We are being felled. Greattrees are falling, falling, falling."

With the last "falling" the speaker came in sight. She was like a woman but so tall thather head was on a level with the Centaur's yet she was like a tree too. It is hard to explainif you have never seen a Dryad but quite unmistakable once you have - somethingdifferent in the colour, the voice, and the hair. King Tirian and the two Beasts knew atonce that she was the nymph of a beech tree.

"Justice, Lord King!" she cried. "Come to our aid. Protect your people. They are fellingus in Lantern Waste.

Forty great trunks of my brothers and sisters are already on the ground."

"What, Lady! Felling Lantern Waste? Murdering the talking trees?" cried the King,leaping to his feet and drawing his sword. "How dare they? And who dares it? Now bythe Mane of Aslan-"

"A-a-a-h," gasped the Dryad shuddering as if in pain - shuddering time after time as ifunder repeated blows. Then all at once she fell sideways as suddenly as if both her feethad been cut from under her. For a second they saw her lying dead on the grass and thenshe vanished. They knew what had happened. Her tree, miles away, had been cut down.

For a moment the King's grief and anger were so great that he could not speak. Then hesaid:

"Come, friends. We must go up river and find the villains who have done this, with allthe speed we may. I will leave not one of them alive."

"Sire, with a good will," said Jewel.

But Roonwit said, "Sire, be wary in your just wrath. There are strange doings on foot. Ifthere should be rebels in arms further up the valley, we three are too few to meet them. Ifit would please you to wait while -"

"I will not wait the tenth part of a second," said the King. "But while Jewel and I goforward, do you gallop as hard as you may to Cair Paravel. Here is my ring for yourtoken. Get me a score of men-at-arms, all well mounted, and a score of Talking Dogs,and ten Dwarfs (let them all be fell archers), and a Leopard or so, and Stonefoot theGiant. Bring all these after us as quickly as may be."

"With a good will, Sire," said Roonwit. And at once he turned and galloped Eastwarddown the valley.

The King strode on at a great pace, sometimes muttering to himself and sometimesclenching his fists. Jewel walked beside him, saying nothing; so there was no soundbetween them but the faint jingle of a rich gold chain that hung round the Unicorn's neckand the noise of two feet and four hoofs.

They soon reached the River and turned up it where there was a grassy road: they had thewater on their left and the forest on their right. Soon after that they came to the placewhere the ground grew rougher and thick wood came down to the water's edge. The road,what there was of it, now ran on the Southern bank and they had to ford the River toreach it. It was up to Tirian's arm-pits, but Jewel (who had four legs and was thereforesteadier) kept on his right so as to break the force of the current, and Tirian put his strongarm round the Unicorn's strong neck and they both got safely over. The King was still soangry that he hardly noticed the cold of the water. But of course he dried his sword verycarefully on the shoulder of his cloak, which was the only dry part of him, as soon as theycame to shore.

They were now going Westward with the River on their right and Lantern Waste straightahead of them. They had not gone more than a mile when they both stopped and bothspoke at the same moment. The King said "What have we here?" and Jewel said "Look!"

"It is a raft," said King Tirian.

And so it was. Half a dozen splendid tree-trunks, all newly cut and newly lopped of theirbranches, had been lashed together to make a raft, and were gliding swiftly down theriver. On the front of the raft there was a water rat with a pole to steer it.

"Hey! Water-Rat! What are you about?" cried the King.

"Taking logs down to sell to the Calormenes, Sire," said the Rat, touching his ear as hemight have touched his cap if he had had one.

"Calormenes!" thundered Tirian. "What do you mean? Who gave order for these trees tobe felled?"

The River flows so swiftly at that time of the year that the raft had already glided past theKing and Jewel. But the Water-Rat looked back over its shoulder and shouted out:

"The Lion's orders, Sire. Aslan himself." He added something more but they couldn't hearit.

The King and the Unicorn stared at one another and both looked more frightened thanthey had ever been in any battle.

"Aslan," said the King at last, in a very low voice. "Aslan. Could it be true? Could he befelling the holy trees and murdering the Dryads?"

"Unless the Dryads have all done something dreadfully wrong-" murmured Jewel.

"But selling them to Calormenes!" said the King. "Is it possible?"

"I don't know," said Jewel miserably. "He's not a tame lion."

"Well," said the King at last, "we must go on and take the adventure that comes to us."

"It is the only thing left for us to do, Sire," said the Unicorn. He did not see at themoment how foolish it was for two of them to go on alone; nor did the King. They weretoo angry to think clearly. But much evil came of their rashness in the end.

Suddenly the King leaned hard on his friend's neck and bowed his head.

"Jewel," he said, "what lies before us? Horrible thoughts arise in my heart. If we had diedbefore today we should have been happy."

"Yes," said Jewel. "We have lived too long. The worst thing in the world has come uponus." They stood like that for a minute or two and then went on.

Before long they could hear the hack-hack-hack of axes falling on timber, though theycould see nothing yet because there was a rise of the ground in front of them. When theyhad reached the top of it they could see right into Lantern Waste itself. And the King'sface turned white when he saw it.

Right through the middle of that ancient forest - that forest where the trees of gold and ofsilver had once grown and where a child from our world had once planted the Tree ofProtection - a broad lane had already been opened. It was a hideous lane like a raw gashin the land, full of muddy ruts where felled trees had been dragged down to the river.

There was a great crowd of people at work, and a cracking of whips, and horses tuggingand straining as they dragged at the logs. The first thing that struck the King and theUnicorn was that about half the people in the crowd were not Talking Beasts but Men.

The next thing was that these men were not the fair-haired men of Narnia: they weredark, bearded men from Calormen, that great and cruel country that lies beyondArchenland across the desert to the south. There was no reason, of course, why oneshould not meet a Calormene or two in Narnia - a merchant or an ambassador - for therewas peace between Narnia and Calormen in those days. But Tirian could not understandwhy there were so many of them: nor why they were cutting down a Narnian forest. Hegrasped his sword tighter and rolled his cloak round his left arm. They came quicklydown among the men.

Two Calormenes were driving a horse which was harnessed to a log. Just as the Kingreached them the log had got stuck in a bad muddy place.

"Get on, son of sloth! Pull, you lazy pig!" cried the Calormenes, cracking their whips.

The horse was already straining himself as hard as he could; his eyes were red and he wascovered with foam.

"Work, lazy brute," shouted one of the Calormenes: and as he spoke he struck the horsesavagely with his whip. It was then that the really dreadful thing happened.

Up till now Tirian had taken it for granted that the horses which the Calormenes weredriving were their own horses; dumb, witless animals like the horses of our own world.

And though he hated to see even a dumb horse overdriven, he was of course thinkingmore about the murder of the Trees. It had never crossed his mind that anyone woulddare to harness one of the free Talking Horses of Narnia, much less to use a whip on it.

But as that savage blow fell the horse reared up and said, half screaming:

"Fool and tyrant! Do you not see I am doing all I can?"

When Tirian knew that the Horse was one of his own Narnians, there came over him andover Jewel such a rage that they did not know what they were doing. The King's swordwent up, the Unicorn's horn went down. They rushed forward together. Next momentboth the Calormenes lay dead, the one beheaded by Tirian's sword and the other goredthrough the heart by Jewel's horn.
