title: CHAPTER 15. FURTHER UP AND FURTHER IN
---

"KNOW, O Warlike Kings," said Emeth, "and you, O ladies whose beauty illuminatesthe universe, that I am Emeth the seventh son of Harpha Tarkaan of the city ofTehishbaan, Westward beyond the desert. I came lately into Narnia with nine and twentyothers under the command of Rishda Tarkaan Now when I first heard that we shouldmarch upon Narnia I rejoiced; for I had heard many things of your Land and desiredgreatly to meet you in battle. But when I found that we were to go in disguised asmerchants (which is a shameful dress for a warrior and the son of a Tarkaan) and to workby lies and trickery, then my joy departed from me. And most of all when I found wemust wait upon a Monkey, and when it began to be said that Tash and Aslan were one,then the world became dark in my eyes. For always since I was a boy I have served Tashand my great desire was to know more of him, if it might be, to look upon his face. Butthe name of Aslan was hateful to me.

"And, as you have seen, we were called together outside the straw-roofed hovel, nightafter night, and the fire was kindled, and the Ape brought forth out of the hovelsomething upon four legs that I could not well see. And the people and the Beasts boweddown and did honour to it. But I thought, the Tarkaan is deceived by the Ape: for thisthing that comes out of the stable is neither Tash nor any other god. But when I watchedthe Tarkaan's face, and marked every word that he said to the Monkey, then I changed mymind: for I saw that the Tarkaan did not believe in it himself. And then I understood thathe did not believe in Tash at all: for if he had, how could he dare to mock him?

"When I understood this, a great rage fell upon me and I wondered that the true Tash didnot strike down both the Monkey and the Tarkaan with fire from heaven. Nevertheless Ihid my anger and held my tongue and waited to see how it would end. But last night, assome of you know, the Monkey brought not forth the yellow thing but said that all whodesired to look upon Tashlan - for so they mixed the two words to pretend that they wereall one - must pass one by one into the hovel. And I said to myself, Doubtless this is someother deception. But when the Cat had followed in and had come out again in a madnessof terror, then I said to myself, Surely the true Tash, whom they called on withoutknowledge or belief, has now come among us, and will avenge himself. And though myheart was turned into water inside me because of the greatness and terror of Tash, yet mydesire was stronger than my fear, and I put force upon my knees to stay them fromtrembling, and on my teeth that they should not chatter, and resolved to look upon theface of Tash though he should slay me. So I offered myself to go into the hovel; and theTarkaan, though unwillingly, let me go.

"As soon as I had gone in at the door, the first wonder was that I found myself in thisgreat sunlight (as we all are now) though the inside of the hovel had looked dark fromoutside. But I had no time to marvel at this, for immediately I was forced to fight for myhead against one of our own men. As soon as I saw him I understood that the Monkeyand the Tarkaan had set him there to slay any who came in if he were not in their secrets:so that this man also was a liar and a mocker and no true servant of Tash. I had the betterwill to fight him; and having slain the villain, I cast him out behind me through the door.

"Then I looked about me and saw the sky and the wide lands, and smelled the sweetness.

And I said, By the Gods, this is a pleasant place: it may be that I am come into thecountry of Tash. And I began to journey into the strange country and to seek him.

"So I went over much grass and many flowers and among all kinds of wholesome anddelectable trees till lo! in a narrow place between two rocks there came to meet me agreat Lion. The speed of him was like the ostrich, and his size was an elephant's; his hairwas like pure gold and the brightness of his eyes like gold that is liquid in the furnace. Hewas more terrible than the Flaming Mountain of Lagour, and in beauty he surpassed allthat is in the world even as the rose in bloom surpasses the dust of the desert. Then I fellat his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of allhonour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it isbetter to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen

him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with histongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of thine butthe servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I accountas service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding,I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as theApe said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but hiswrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but becausewe are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he areof such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which isnot vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for theoath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I whoreward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the nameAslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand,Child? I said, Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truthconstrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the GloriousOne, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly.

For all find what they truly seek.

"Then he breathed upon me and took away the trembling from my limbs and caused meto stand upon my feet. And after that, he said not much, but that we should meet again,and I must go further up and further in. Then he turned him about in a storm and flurry ofgold and was gone suddenly.

"And since then, O Kings and Ladies, I have been wandering to find him and myhappiness is so great that it even weakens me like a wound. And this is the marvel ofmarvels, that he called me Beloved, me who am but as a dog -"

"Eh? What's that?" said one of the Dogs.

"Sir," said Emeth. "It is but a fashion of speech which we have in Calormen."

"Well, I can't say it's one I like very much," said the Dog.

"He doesn't mean any harm," said an older Dog.

"After all, we call our puppies Boys when they don't behave properly."

"So we do," said the first Dog. "Or girls."

"S-s-sh!" said the Old Dog. "That's not a nice word to use. Remember where you are."

"Look!" said Jill suddenly. Someone was coming, rather timidly, to meet them; a gracefulcreature on four feet, all silvery-grey. And they stared at him for a whole ten secondsbefore five or six voices said all at once, "Why, it's old Puzzle!" They had never seen himby daylight with the lion-skin off, and it made an extraordinary difference. He washimself now: a beautiful donkey with such a soft, grey coat and such a gentle, honest face

that if you had seen him you would have done just what Jill and Lucy did - rushedforward and put your arms round his neck and kissed his nose and stroked his ears.

When they asked him where he had been he said he had come in at the door along withall the other creatures but he had - well, to tell the truth, he had been keeping out of theirway as much as he could; and out of Aslan's way. For the sight of the real Lion had madehim so ashamed of all that nonsense about dressing up in a lion-skin that he did not knowhow to look anyone in the face. But when he saw that all his friends were going awayWestward, and after he had had a mouthful of grass ("And I've never tasted such goodgrass in my life," said Puzzle), he plucked up his courage and followed. "But what I'll doif I really have to meet Aslan, I'm sure I don't know," he added.

"You'll find it will be all right when you really do," said Queen Lucy.

Then they went forward together, always Westward, for that seemed to be the directionAslan had meant when he cried out, "Further up and futher in." Many other creatureswere slowly moving the same way, but that grassy country was very wide and there wasno crowding.

It still seemed to be early, and the morning freshness was in the air. They kept onstopping to look round and to look behind them, partly because it was so beautiful butpartly also because there was something about it which they could not understand.

"Peter," said Lucy, "where is this, do you suppose?"

"I don't know," said the High King. "It reminds me of somewhere but I can't give it aname. Could it be somewhere we once stayed for a holiday when we were very, verysmall?"

"It would have to have been a jolly good holiday," said Eustace. "I bet there isn't acountry like this anywhere in our world. Look at the colours! You couldn't get a blue likethe blue on those mountains in our world."

"Is it not Aslan's country?" said Tirian.

"Not like Aslan's country on top of that mountain beyond the Eastern end of the world,"said Jill. "I've been there."

"If you ask me," said Edmund, "it's like somewhere in the Narnian world. Look at thosemountains ahead - and the big ice-mountains beyond them. Surely they're rather like themountains we used to see from Narnia, the ones up Westward beyond the Waterfall?"

"Yes, so they are," said Peter. "Only these are bigger."

"I don't think those ones are so very like anything in Narnia," said Lucy. "But look there."She pointed Southward to their left, and everyone stopped and turned to look. "Those

hills," said Lucy, "the nice woody ones and the blue ones behind - aren't they very likethe Southern border of Narnia?"

"Like!" cried Edmund after a moment's silence. "Why, they're exactly like. Look, there'sMount Pire with his forked head, and there's the pass into Archenland and everything!"

"And yet they're not like," said Lucy. "They're different. They have more colours on themand they look further away than I remembered and they're more .. . more . . . oh, I don'tknow..."

"More like the real thing," said the Lord Digory softly.

Suddenly Farsight the Eagle spread his wings, soared thirty or forty feet up into the air,circled round and then alighted on the ground.

"Kings and Queens," he cried, "we have all been blind. We are only beginning to seewhere we are. From up there I have seen it all - Ettinsmuir, Beaversdam, the Great River,and Cair Paravel still shining on the edge of the Eastern Sea. Narnia is not dead. This isNarnia."

"But how can it be?" said Peter. "For Aslan told us older ones that we should never returnto Narnia, and here we are."

"Yes," said Eustace. "And we saw it all destroyed and the sun put out."

"And it's all so different," said Lucy.

"The Eagle is right," said the Lord Digory. "Listen, Peter. When Aslan said you couldnever go back to Narnia, he meant the Narnia you were thinking of. But that was not thereal Narnia. That had a beginning and an end. It was only a shadow or a copy of the realNarnia which has always been here and always will be here: just as our world, Englandand all, is only a shadow or copy of something in Aslan's real world. You need not mournover Narnia, Lucy. All of the old Narnia that mattered, all the dear creatures, have beendrawn into the real Narnia through the Door. And of course it is different; as different asa real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream." His voice stirredeveryone like a trumpet as he spoke these words: but when he added under his breath "It'sall in Plato, all in Plato: bless me, what do they teach them at these schools!" the olderones laughed. It was so exactly like the sort of thing they had heard him say long ago inthat other world where his beard was grey instead of golden. He knew why they werelaughing and joined in the laugh himself. But very quickly they all became grave again:for, as you know, there is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It istoo good to waste on jokes.

It is as hard to explain how this sunlit land was different from the old Narnia as it wouldbe to tell you how the fruits of that country taste. Perhaps you will get some idea of it ifyou think like this. You may have been in a room in which there was a window that

looked out on a lovely bay of the sea or a green valley that wound away amongmountains. And in the wall of that room opposite to the window there may have been alookingglass. And as you turned away from the window you suddenly caught sight of thatsea or that valley, all over again, in the looking glass. And the sea in the mirror, or thevalley in the mirror, were in one sense just the same as the real ones: yet at the same timethey were somehow different - deeper, more wonderful, more like places in a story: in astory you have never heard but very much want to know. The difference between the oldNarnia and the new Narnia was like that. The new one was a deeper country: every rockand flower and blade of grass looked as if it meant more. I can't describe it any betterthan that: if ever you get there you will know what I mean.

It was the Unicorn who summed up what everyone was feeling. He stamped his rightfore-hoof on the ground and neighed, and then cried:

"I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I havebeen looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now. The reason why we lovedthe old Narnia is that it sometimes looked a little like this. Bree-hee-hee! Come furtherup, come further in!"

He shook his mane and sprang forward into a great gallop - a Unicorn's gallop, which, inour world, would have carried him out of sight in a few moments. But now a moststrange thing happened. Everyone else began to run, and they found, to theirastonishment, that they could keep up with him: not only the Dogs and the humans buteven fat little Puzzle and short-legged Poggin the Dwarf. The air flew in their faces as ifthey were driving fast in a car without a windscreen. The country flew past as if theywere seeing it from the windows of an express train. Faster and faster they raced, but noone got hot or tired or out of breath.
