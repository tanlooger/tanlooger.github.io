title: CHAPTER 8. WHAT NEWS THE EAGLE BROUGHT
---

IN the shadow of the trees on the far side of the clearing something was moving. It wasgliding very slowly Northward. At a first glance you might have mistaken it for smoke,for it was grey and you could see things through it. But the deathly smell was not thesmell of smoke. Also, this thing kept its shape instead of billowing and curling as smoke

would have done. It was roughly the shape of a man but it had the head of a bird; somebird of prey with a cruel, curved beak. It had four arms which it held high above its head,stretching them out Northward as if it wanted to snatch all Narnia in its grip; and itsfingers - all twenty of them - were curved like its beak and had long, pointed, bird-likeclaws instead of nails. It floated on the grass instead of walking, and the grass seemed towither beneath it.

After one look at it Puzzle gave a screaming bray and darted into the Tower. And Jill(who was no coward, as you know) hid her face in her hands to shut out the sight of it.

The others watched it for perhaps a minute, until it streamed away into the thicker treeson their right and disappeared. Then the sun came out again, and the birds once morebegan to sing.

Everyone started breathing properly again and moved. They had all been still as statueswhile it was in sight.

"What was it?" said Eustace in a whisper.

"I have seen it once before," said Tirian. "But that time it was carved in stone andoverlaid with gold and had solid diamonds for eyes. It was when I was no older thanthou, and had gone as a guest to The Tisroc's court in Tashbaan.

He took me into the great temple of Tash. There I saw it, carved above the altar."

"Then that - that thing - was Tash?" said Eustace.

But instead of answering him Tirian slipped his arm behind Jill's shoulders and said,"How is it with you, Lady?"

"A-all right," said Jill, taking her hands away from her pale face and trying to smile. "I'mall right. It only made me feel a little sick for a moment."

"It seems, then," said the Unicorn, "that there is a real Tash, after all."

"Yes," said the Dwarf. "And this fool of an Ape, who didn't believe in Tash, will getmore than he bargained for! He called for Tash: Tash has come."

"Where has it - he - the Thing - gone to?" said Jill.

"North into the heart of Narnia," said Tirian. "It has come to dwell among us. They havecalled it and it has come."

"Ho, ho, ho!" chuckled the Dwarf, rubbing his hairy hands together. "It will be a surprisefor the Ape. People shouldn't call for demons unless they really mean what they say."

"Who knows if Tash will be visible to the Ape?" said Jewel.

"Where has Puzzle got to?" said Eustace.

They all shouted out Puzzle's name and Jill went round to the other side of the Tower tosee if he had gone there.

They were quite tired of looking for him when at last his large grey head peeredcautiously out of the doorway and he said, "Has it gone away?" And when at last they gothim to come out, he was shivering the way a dog shivers before a thunderstorm.

"I see now," said Puzzle, "that I really have been a very bad donkey. I ought never tohave listened to Shift. I never thought things like this would begin to happen."

"If you'd spent less time saying you weren't clever and more time trying to be as clever asyou could -" began Eustace but Jill interrupted him.

"Oh leave poor old Puzzle alone," she said. "It was all a mistake; wasn't it, Puzzle dear?"And she kissed him on the nose.

Though rather shaken by what they had seen, the whole party now sat down again andwent on with their talk.

Jewel had little to tell them. While he was a prisoner he had spent nearly all his time tiedup at the back of the stable, and had of course heard none of the enemies' plans. He hadbeen kicked (he'd done some kicking back too) and beaten and threatened with deathunless he would say that he believed it was Aslan who was brought out and shown tothem by firelight every night. In fact he was going to be executed this very morning if hehad not been rescued. He didn't know what had happened to the Lamb.

The question they had to decide was whether they would go to Stable Hill again thatnight, show Puzzle to the Narnians and try to make them see how they had been tricked,or whether they should steal away Eastward to meet the help which Roonwit the Centaurwas bringing up from Cair Paravel and return against the Ape and his Calormenes inforce. Tirian would very much like to have followed the first plan: he hated the idea ofleaving the Ape to bully his people one moment longer than need be. On the other hand,the way the Dwarfs had behaved last night was a warning. Apparently one couldn't besure how people would take it even if he showed them Puzzle. And there were theCalormene soldiers to be reckoned with. Poggin thought there were about thirty of them.

Tirian felt sure that if the Narnians all rallied to his side, he and Jewel and the childrenand Poggin (Puzzle didn't count for much) would have a good chance of beating them.

But how if half the Narnians - including all the Dwarfs - just sat and looked on? or evenfought against him? The risk was too great. And there was, too, the cloudy shape of Tash.

What might it do?

And then, as Poggin pointed out, there was no harm in leaving the Ape to deal with hisown difficulties for a day or two. He would have no Puzzle to bring out and show now. It

wasn't easy to see what story he - or Ginger could make up to explain that. If the Beastsasked night after night to see Aslan, and no Aslan was brought out, surely even thesimplest of them would get suspicious.

In the end they all agreed that the best thing was to go off and try to meet Roonwit.

As soon as they had decided this, it was wonderful how much more cheerful everyonebecame. I don't honestly think that this was because any of them was afraid of a fight(except perhaps Jill and Eustace). But I daresay that each of them, deep down inside, wasvery glad not to go any nearer - or not yet - to that horrible bird-headed thing which,visible or invisible, was now probably haunting Stable Hill. Anyway, one always feelsbetter when one has made up one's mind.

Tirian said they had better remove their disguises, as they didn't want to be mistaken forCalormenes and perhaps attacked by any loyal Narnians they might meet. The Dwarfmade up a horrid-looking mess of ashes from the hearth and grease out of the jar ofgrease which was kept for rubbing on swords and spear-heads. Then they took off theirCalormene armour and went down to the stream. The nasty mixture made a lather justlike soft soap: it was a pleasant, homely sight to see Tirian and the two children kneelingbeside the water and scrubbing the backs of their necks or puffing and blowing as theysplashed the lather off. Then they went back to the Tower with red, shiny faces, likepeople who have been given an extra good wash before a party. They re-armedthemselves in true Narnian style, with straight swords and three-cornered shields. "Bodyof me," said Tirian. "That is better. I feel a true man again."

Puzzle begged very hard to have the lion-skin taken off him. He said it was too hot andthe way it was rucked up on his back was uncomfortable: also, it made him look so silly.

But they told him he would have to wear it a bit longer, for they still wanted to show himin that get-up to the other Beasts, even though they were now going to meet Roonwitfirst.

What was left of the pigeon-meat and rabbit-meat was not worth bringing away but theytook some biscuits. Then Tirian locked the door of the Tower and that was the end oftheir stay there.

It was a little after two in the afternoon when they set out, and it was the first really warmday of that spring. The young leaves seemed to be much further out than yesterday: thesnow-drops were over, but they saw several primroses. The sunlight slanted through thetrees, birds sang, and always (though usually out of sight) there was the noise of runningwater. It was hard to think of horrible things like Tash. The children felt, "This is reallyNarnia at last." Even Tirian's heart grew lighter as he walked ahead of them, humming anold Narnian marching song which had the refrain:

Ho, rumble, rumble, rumble, Rumble drum belaboured.

After the King came Eustace and Poggin the Dwarf. Poggin was telling Eustace thenames of all the Narnian trees, birds, and plants which he didn't know already.

Sometimes Eustace would tell him about English ones.

After them came Puzzle, and after him Jill and Jewel walking very close together. Jillhad, as you might say, quite fallen in love with the Unicorn. She thought- and she wasn'tfar wrong - that he was the shiningest, delicatest, most graceful animal she had ever met:and he was so gentle and soft of speech that, if you hadn't known, you would hardly havebelieved how fierce and terrible he could be in battle.

"Oh, this is nice!" said Jill. "Just walking along like this. I wish there could be more ofthis sort of adventure. It's a pity there's always so much happening in Narnia."

But the Unicorn explained to her that she was quite mistaken. He said that the Sons andDaughters of Adam and Eve were brought out of their own strange world into Narniaonly at times when Narnia was stirred and upset, but she mustn't think it was always likethat. In between their visits there were hundreds and thousands of years when peacefulKing followed peaceful King till you could hardly remember their names or count theirnumbers, and there was really hardly anything to put into the History Books. And hewent on to talk of old Queens and heroes whom she had never heard of. He spoke ofSwanwhite the Queen who had lived before the days of the White Witch and the GreatWinter, who was so beautiful that when she looked into any forest pool the reflection ofher face shone out of the water like a star by night for a year and a day afterwards. Hespoke of Moonwood the Hare who had such ears that he could sit by Caldron Pool underthe thunder of the great waterfall and hear what men spoke in whispers at Cair Paravel.

He told how King Gale, who was ninth in descent from Frank the first of all Kings, hadsailed far away into the Eastern seas and delivered the Lone Islanders from a dragon andhow, in return, they had given him the Lone Islands to be part of the royal lands of Narniafor ever. He talked of whole centuries in which all Narnia was so happy that notabledances and feasts, or at most tournaments, were the only things that could beremembered, and every day and week had been better than the last. And as he went on,the picture of all those happy years, all the thousands of them, piled up in Jill's mind till itwas rather like looking down from a high hill on to a rich, lovely plain full of woods andwaters and cornfields, which spread away and away till it got thin and misty fromdistance. And she said:

"Oh, I do hope we can soon settle the Ape and get back to those good, ordinary times.

And then I hope they'll go on for ever and ever and ever. Our world is going to have anend some day. Perhaps this one won't. Oh Jewel wouldn't it be lovely if Narnia just wenton and on - like what you said it has been?"

"Nay, sister," answered Jewel, "all worlds draw to an end, except Aslan's own country."

"Well, at least," said Jill, "I hope the end of this one is millions of millions of millions ofyears away - hallo! what are we stopping for?"

The King and Eustace and the Dwarf were all staring up at the sky. Jill shuddered,remembering what horrors they had seen already. But it was nothing of that sort this time.

It was small, and looked black against the blue.

"I dare swear," said the Unicorn, "from its flight, that it is a Talking bird."

"So think I," said the King. "But is it a friend, or a spy of the Ape's?"

"To me, Sire," said the Dwarf, "it has a look of Far-sight the Eagle."

"Ought we to hide under the trees?" said Eustace.

"Nay," said Tirian, "best stand still as rocks. He would see us for certain if we moved."

"Look! He wheels, he has seen us already," said Jewel. "He is coming down in widecircles."

"Arrow on string, Lady," said Tirian to Jill. "But by no means shoot till I bid you. He maybe a friend."

If one had known what was going to happen next it would have been a treat to watch thegrace and ease with which the huge bird glided down. He alighted on a rocky crag a fewfeet from Tirian, bowed his crested head, and said in his strange eagle's-voice, "Hail,King."

"Hail, Farsight," said Tirian. "And since you call me King, I may well believe you are nota follower of the Ape and his false Aslan. I am right glad of your coming."

"Sire," said the Eagle, "when you have heard my news you will be sorrier of my comingthan of the greatest woe that ever befell you."

Tirian's heart seemed to stop beating at these words, but he set his teeth and said, "Tellon."

"Two sights have I seen," said Farsight. "One was Cair Paravel filled with dead Narniansand living Calormenes: The Tisroc's banner advanced upon your royal battlements: andyour subjects flying from the city - this way and that, into the woods. Cair Paravel wastaken from the sea. Twenty great ships of Calormen put in there in the dark of the nightbefore last night."

No one could speak.

"And the other sight, five leagues nearer than Cair Paravel, was Roonwit the Centaurlying dead with a Calormene arrow in his side. I was with him in his last hour and hegave me this message to your Majesty: to remember that all worlds draw to an end andthat noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy."

"So," said the King, after a long silence, "Narnia is no more."
