title: CHAPTER 16. FAREWELL TO SHADOWLANDS
---

IF one could run without getting tired, I don't think one would often want to do anythingelse. But there might be special reasons for stopping, and it was a special reason whichmade Eustace presently shout:

"I say! Steady! Look what we're coming to!"

And well he might. For now they saw before them Caldron Pool and beyond the Pool thehigh unclimbable cliffs and, pouring down the cliffs, thousands of tons of water everysecond, flashing like diamonds in some places and dark, glassy green in others, the GreatWaterfall; and already the thunder of it was in their ears.

"Don't stop! Further up and further in," called Farsight, tilting his flight a little upwards.

"It's all very well for him," said Eustace, but Jewel also cried out:

"Don't stop. Further up and further in! Take it in your stride."

His voice could only just be heard above the roar of the water but next moment everyonesaw that he had plunged into the Pool. And helter-skelter behind him, with splash aftersplash, all the others did the same. The water was not biting cold as all of them (andespecially Puzzle) expected, but of a delicious foamy coolness. They all found they wereswimming straight for the Waterfall itself.

"This is absolutely crazy," said Eustace to Edmund.

"I know. And yet -" said Edmund.

"Isn't it wonderful?" said Lucy. "Have you noticed one can't feel afraid, even if one wantsto? Try it."

"By Jove, neither one can," said Eustace after he had tried.

Jewel reached the foot of the Waterfall first, but Tirian was only just behind him. Jill waslast, so she could see the whole thing better than the others. She saw something whitemoving steadily up the face of the Waterfall. That white thing was the Unicorn. Youcouldn't tell whether he was swimming or climbing, but he moved on, higher and higher.

The point of his horn divided the water just above his head, and it cascaded out in tworainbow-coloured streams all round his shoulders. Just behind him came King Tirian. Hemoved his legs and arms as if he were swimming but he moved straight upwards: as ifone could swim up the wall of a house.

What looked funniest was the Dogs. During the gallop they had not been at all out ofbreath, but now, as they swarmed and wriggled upwards, there was plenty of splutteringand sneezing among them; that was because they would keep on barking, and every timethey barked they got their mouths and noses full of water. But before Jill had time tonotice all these things fully, she was going up the Waterfall herself. It was the sort ofthing that would have been quite impossible in our world. Even if you hadn't beendrowned, you would have been smashed to pieces by the terrible weight of water againstthe countless jags of rock. But in that world you could do it. You went on, up and up,with all kinds of reflected lights flashing at you from the water and all manner ofcoloured stones flashing through it, till it seemed as if you were climbing up light itself -

and always higher and higher till the sense of height would have terrified you if youcould be terrified, but later it was only gloriously exciting. And then at last one came tothe lovely, smooth green curve in which the water poured over the top and found that onewas out on the level river above the Waterfall. The current was racing away behind you,

but you were such a wonderful swimmer that you could make headway against it. Soonthey were all on the bank, dripping buthappy.

A long valley opened ahead and great snow-mountains, now much nearer, stood upagainst the sky.

"Further up and further in," cried Jewel and instantly they were off again.

They were out of Narnia now and up into the Western Wild which neither Tirian norPeter nor even the Eagle had ever seen before. But the Lord Digory and the Lady Pollyhad. "Do you remember? Do you remember?" they said - and said it in steady voices too,without panting, though the whole party was now running faster than an arrow flies.

"What, Lord?" said Tirian. "Is it then true, as stories tell, that you two journeyed here onthe very day the world was made?"

"Yes," said Digory, "and it seems to me as if it were only yesterday."

"And on a flying horse?" asked Tirian. "Is that part true?"

"Certainly," said Digory. But the Dogs barked, "Faster, faster!"

So they ran faster and faster till it was more like flying than running, and even the Eagleoverhead was going no faster than they. And they went through winding valley afterwinding valley and up the steep sides of hills and, faster than ever, down the other side,following the river and sometimes crossing it and skimming across mountainlakes as ifthey were living speed-boats, till at last at the far end of one long lake which looked asblue as a turquoise, they saw a smooth green hill. Its sides were as steep as the sides of apyramid and round the very top of it ran a green wall: but above the wall rose thebranches of trees whose leaves looked like silver and their fruit like gold.

"Further up and further in!" roared the Unicorn, and no one held back. They chargedstraight at the foot of the hill and then found themselves running up it almost as waterfrom a broken wave runs up a rock out at the point of some bay. Though the slope wasnearly as steep as the roof of a house and the grass was smooth as a bowling green, noone slipped. Only when they had reached the very top did they slow up; that was becausethey found themselves facing great golden gates. And for a moment none of them wasbold enough to try if the gates would open. They all felt just as they had felt about thefruit "Dare we? Is it right? Can it be meant for us?"

But while they were standing thus a great horn, wonderfully loud and sweet, blew fromsomewhere inside that walled garden and the gates swung open.

Tirian stood holding his breath and wondering who would come out. And what came wasthe last thing he had expected: a little, sleek, bright-eyed Talking Mouse with a red

feather stuck in a circlet on its head and its left paw resting on a long sword. It bowed, amost beautiful bow, and said in its shrill voice:

"Welcome, in the Lion's name. Come further up and further in."

Then Tirian saw King Peter and King Edmund and Queen Lucy rush forward to kneeldown and greet the Mouse and they all cried out "Reepicheep!" And Tirian breathed fastwith the sheer wonder of it, for now he knew that he was looking at one of the greatheroes of Narnia, Reepicheep the Mouse who had fought at the great Battle of Berunaand afterwards sailed to the World's end with King Caspian the Seafarer. But before hehad had much time to think of this he felt two strong arms thrown about him and felt abearded kiss on his cheeks and heard a well remembered voice saying:

"What, lad? Art thicker and taller since I last touched thee!"

It was his own father, the good King Erlian: but not as Tirian had seen him last when theybrought him home pale and wounded from his fight with the giant, nor even as Tirianremembered him in his later years when he was a grey-headed warrior. This was hisfather, young and merry, as he could just remember him from very early days when hehimself had been a little boy playing games with his father in the castle garden at CairParavel, just before bedtime on summer evenings. The very smell of the bread-and-milkhe used to have for supper came back to him.

Jewel thought to himself, "I will leave them to talk for a little and then I will go and greetthe good King Erlian. Many a bright apple has he given me when I was but a colt." Butnext moment he had something else to think of, for out of the gateway there came a horseso mighty and noble that even a Unicorn might feel shy in its presence: a great wingedhorse. It looked a moment at the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly and neighed out "What,cousins!" and they both shouted "Fledge! Good old Fledge!" and rushed to kiss it.

But by now the Mouse was again urging them to come in. So all of them passed inthrough the golden gates, into the delicious smell that blew towards them out of thatgarden and into the cool mixture of sunlight and shadow under the trees, walking onspringy turf that was all dotted with white flowers. The very first thing which struckeveryone was that the place was far larger than it had seemed from outside. But no onehad time to think about that for people were coming up to meet the newcomers fromevery direction.

Everyone you had ever heard of (if you knew the history of these countries) seemed to bethere. There was Glimfeather the Owl and Puddleglum the Marshwiggle, and King Rilianthe Disenchanted, and his mother the Star's daughter and his great father Caspian himself.

And close beside him were the Lord Drinian and the Lord Berne and Trumpkin theDwarf and Truffle-hunter the good Badger with Glenstorm the Centaur and a hundredother heroes of the great War of Deliverance. And then from another side came Cor theKing of Archenland with King Lune his father and his wife Queen Aravis and the braveprince Corin Thunder-Fist, his brother, and Bree the Horse and Hwin the Mare. And then

- which was a wonder beyond all wonders to Tirian - there came from further away in thepast, the two good Beavers and Tumnus the Faun. And there was greeting and kissingand hand-shaking and old jokes revived, (you've no idea how good an old joke soundswhen you take it out again after a rest of five or six hundred years) and the wholecompany moved forward to the centre of the orchard where the Phoenix sat in a tree andlooked down upon them all, and at the foot of that tree were two thrones and in those twothrones a King and Queen so great and beautiful that everyone bowed down before them.

And well they might, for these two were King Frank and Queen Helen from whom all themost ancient Kings of Narnia and Archenland are descended. And Tirian felt as youwould feel if you were brought before Adam and Eve in all their glory.

About half an hour later - or it might have been half a hundred years later, for time thereis not like time here - Lucy stood with her dear friend, her oldest Narnian friend, the FaunTumnus, looking down over the wall of that garden, and seeing all Narnia spread outbelow. But when you looked down you found that this hill was much higher than you hadthought: it sank down with shining cliffs, thousands of feet below them and trees in thatlower world looked no bigger than grains of green salt. Then she turned inward again andstood with her back to the wall and looked at the garden.

"I see," she said at last, thoughtfully. "I see now. This garden is like the stable. It is farbigger inside than it was outside."

"Of course, Daughter of Eve," said the Faun. "The further up and the further in you go,the bigger everything gets. The inside is larger than the outside."

Lucy looked hard at the garden and saw that it was not really a garden but a whole world,with its own rivers and woods and sea and mountains. But they were not strange: sheknew them all.

"I see," she said. "This is still Narnia, and more real and more beautiful then the Narniadown below, just as it was more real and more beautiful than the Narnia outside thestable door! I see... world within world, Narnia within Narnia..."

"Yes," said Mr Tumnus, "like an onion: except that as you go in and in, each circle islarger than the last."

And Lucy looked this way and that and soon found that a new and beautiful thing hadhappened to her. Whatever she looked at, however far away it might be, once she hadfixed her eyes steadily on it, became quite clear and close as if she were looking througha telescope. She could see the whole Southern desert and beyond it the great city ofTashbaan: to Eastward she could see Cair Paravel on the edge of the sea and the verywindow of the room that had once been her own. And far out to sea she could discoverthe islands, islands after islands to the end of the world, and, beyond the end, the hugemountain which they had called Aslan's country. But now she saw that it was part of agreat chain of mountains which ringed round the whole world. In front of her it seemed tocome quite close. Then she looked to her left and saw what she took to be a great bank of

brightly-coloured cloud, cut off from them by a gap. But she looked harder and saw thatit was not a cloud at all but a real land. And when she had fixed her eyes on oneparticular spot of it, she at once cried out, "Peter! Edmund! Come and look! Comequickly." And they came and looked, for their eyes also had become like hers.

"Whys" exclaimed Peter. "It's England. And that's the house itself - Professor Kirk's oldhome in the country where all our adventures began!"

"I thought that house had been destroyed," said Edmund.

"So it was," said the Faun. "But you are now looking at the England within England, thereal England just as this is the real Narnia. And in that inner England no good thing isdestroyed."

Suddenly they shifted their eyes to another spot, and then Peter and Edmund and Lucygasped with amazement and shouted out and began waving: for there they saw their ownfather and mother, waving back at them across the great, deep valley. It was like whenyou see people waving at you from the deck of a big ship when you are waiting on thequay to meet them.

"How can we get at them?" said Lucy.

"That is easy," said Mr Tumnus. "That country and this country - all the real countries -

are only spurs jutting out from the great mountains of Aslan. We have only to walk alongthe ridge, upward and inward, till it joins on. And listen! There is King Frank's horn: wemust all go up."

And soon they found themselves all walking together and a great, bright procession itwas - up towards mountains higher than you could see in this world even if they werethere to be seen. But there was no snow on those mountains: there were forests and greenslopes and sweet orchards and flashing waterfalls, one above the other, going up forever.

And the land they were walking on grew narrower all the time, with a deep valley oneach side: and across that valley the land which was the real England grew nearer andnearer.

The light ahead was growing stronger. Lucy saw that a great series of many-colouredcliffs led up in front of them like a giant's staircase. And then she forgot everything else,because Aslan himself was coming, leaping down from cliff to cliff like a living cataractof power and beauty.

And the very first person whom Aslan called to him was Puzzle the Donkey. You neversaw a donkey look feebler and sillier than Puzzle did as he walked up to Aslan, and helooked, beside Aslan, as small as a kitten looks beside a St Bernard. The Lion boweddown his head and whispered something to Puzzle at which his long ears went down, butthen he said something else at which the ears perked up again. The humans couldn't hearwhat he had said either time. Then Aslan turned to them and said:

"You do not yet look so happy as I mean you to be."

Lucy said, "We're so afraid of being sent away, Aslan. And you have sent us back intoour own world so often."

"No fear of that," said Aslan. "Have you not guessed?"

Their hearts leaped and a wild hope rose within them.

"There was a real railway accident," said Aslan softly.

"Your father and mother and all of you are - as you used to

call it in the Shadowlands - dead. The term is over: the

holidays have begun. The dream is ended: this is the

morning."

And as He spoke He no longer looked to them like a lion; but

the things that began to happen after that were so great and

beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this is the

end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they

all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the

beginning of the real story. All their life in this world

and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover

and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter

One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which

goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the

one before.
