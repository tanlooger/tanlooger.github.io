title: CHAPTER 12. THROUGH THE STABLE DOOR
---

JILL ought to have been back at the white rock already but she had quite forgotten thatpart of her orders in the excitement of watching the fight. Now she remembered. Sheturned at once and ran to it, and arrived there barely a second before the others. It thushappened that all of them, for a moment, had their backs to the enemy. They all wheeledround the moment they had reached it. A terrible sight met their eyes.

A Calormene was running towards the stable door carrying something that kicked andstruggled. As he came between them and the fire they could see clearly both the shape ofthe man and the shape of what he carried. It was Eustace.

Tirian and the Unicorn rushed out to rescue him. But the Calormene was now far nearerto the door then they. Before they had covered half the distance he had flung Eustace inand shut the door on him. Half a dozen more Calormenes had run up behind him. Theyformed a line on the open space before the stable. There was no getting at it now.

Even then Jill remembered to keep her face turned aside, well away from her bow. "Evenif I can't stop blubbing, I won't get my string wet," she said.

"'Ware arrows," said Poggin suddenly.

Everyone ducked and pulled his helmet well over his

nose. The Dogs crouched behind. But though a few arrows came their way it soonbecame clear that they were not being shot at. Griffle and his Dwarfs were at theirarchery again. This time they were coolly shooting at the Calormenes.

"Keep it up, boys!" came Griffle's voice. "All together. Carefully. We don't want Darkiesany more than we want Monkeys - or Lions - or Kings. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs."

Whatever else you may say about Dwarfs, no one can say they aren't brave. They couldeasily have got away to some safe place. They preferred to stay and kill as many of bothsides as they could, except when both sides were kind enough to save them trouble bykilling one another. They wanted Narnia for their own.

What perhaps they had not taken into account was that the Calormenes were mail-cladand the Horses had had no protection. Also the Calormenes had a leader. RishdaTarkaan's voice cried out:

"Thirty of you keep watch on those fools by the white rock. The rest, after me, that wemay teach these sons of earth a lesson."

Tirian and his friends, still panting from their fight and thankful for a few minutes' rest,stood and looked on while the Tarkaan led his men against the Dwarfs. It was a strangescene by now. The fire had sunk lower: the light it gave was now less and of a darker red.

As far as one could see, the whole place of assembly was now empty except for theDwarf and the Calormenes. In that light one couldn't make out much of what washappening. It sounded as if the Dwarfs were putting up a good fight. Tirian could hearGriffle using dreadful language, and every now and then the Tarkaan calling, "Take allyou can alive! Take them alive!"

Whatever that fight may have been like, it did not last long. The noise of it died away.

Then Jill saw the Tarkaan coming back to the stable: eleven men followed him, draggingeleven bound Dwarfs. (Whether the others had all been killed, or whether some of themhad got away, was never known.)

"Throw them into the shrine of Tash," said Rishda Tarkaan.

And when the eleven Dwarfs, one after the other, had been flung or kicked into that darkdoorway and the door had been shut again, he bowed low to the stable and said:

"These also are for thy burnt offering, Lord Tash."

And all the Calormenes banged the flats of their swords on their shields and shouted,"Tash! Tash! The great god Tash! Inexorable Tash!" (There was no nonsense about"Tashlan" now.)

The little party by the white rock watched these doings and whispered to one another.

They had found a trickle of water coming down the rock and all had drunk eagerly - Jilland Poggin and the King in their hands, while the four-footed ones lapped from the littlepool which it had made at the foot of the stone. Such was their thirst that it seemed themost delicious drink they had ever had in their lives, and while they were drinking theywere perfectly happy and could not think of anything else.

"I feel in my bones," said Poggin, "that we shall all, one by one, pass through that darkdoor before morning. I can think of a hundred deaths I would rather have died."

"It is indeed a grim door," said Tirian. "It is more like a mouth."

"Oh, can't we do anything to stop it?" said Jill in a shaken voice.

"Nay, fair friend," said Jewel, nosing her gently. "It may be for us the door to Aslan'scountry and we shall sup at his table tonight."

Rishda Tarkaan turned his back on the stable and walked slowly to a place in front of thewhite rock.

"Hearken," he said. "If the Boar and the Dogs and the Unicorn will come over to me andput themselves in my mercy, their lives shall be spared. The Boar shall go to a cage inThe Tisroc's garden, the Dogs to The Tisroc's kennels, and the Unicorn, when I havesawn his horn off, shall draw a cart. But the Eagle, the children, and he who was the Kingshall be offered to Tash this night."

The only answer was growls.

"Get on, warriors," said the Tarkaan. "Kill the beasts, but take the two-legged ones alive."

And then the last battle of the last King of Narnia began.

What made it hopeless, even apart from the numbers of the enemy, was the spears. TheCalormenes who had been with the Ape almost from the beginning had had no spears:that was because they had come into Narnia by ones and twos, pretending to be peacefulmerchants, and of course they had carried no spears for a spear is not a thing you canhide. The new ones must have come in later, after the Ape was already strong and theycould march openly. The spears made all the difference. With a long spear you can kill aboar before you are in reach of his tusks and a unicorn before you are in reach of hishorn; if you are very quick and keep your head. And now the levelled spears were closingin on Tirian and his last friends. Next minute they were all fighting for their lives.

In a way it wasn't quite so bad as you might think.

When you are using every muscle to the full - ducking under a spear-point here, leapingover it there, lunging forward, drawing back, wheeling round - you haven't much time tofeel either frightened or sad. Tirian knew he could do nothing for the others now; theywere all doomed together. He vaguely saw the Boar go down on one side of him, andJewel fighting furiously on the other. Out of the corner of one eye he saw, but only justsaw, a big Calormene pulling Jill away somewhere by her hair. But he hardly thoughtabout any of these things. His only thought now was to sell his life as dearly as he could.

The worst of it was that he couldn't keep to the position in which he had started, under thewhite rock. A man who is fighting a dozen enemies at once must take his chanceswherever he can; must dart in wherever he sees an enemy's breast or neck unguarded. In avery few strokes this may get you quite a distance from the spot where you began. Tiriansoon found that he was getting further and further to the right, nearer to the stable. He hada vague idea in his mind that there was some good reason for keeping away from it. Buthe couldn't now remember what the reason was. And anyway, he couldn't help it.

All at once everything came quite clear. He found he was fighting the Tarkaan himself.

The bonfire (what was left of it) was straight in front. He was in fact fighting in the verydoorway of the stable, for it had been opened and two Calormenes were holding the door,ready to slam it shut the moment he was inside. He remembered everything now, and herealized that the enemy had been edging him to the stable on purpose ever since the fightbegan. And while he was thinking this he was still fighting the Tarkaan as hard as hecould.

A new idea came into Tirian's head. He dropped his sword, darted forward, in under thesweep of the Tarkaan's scimitar, seized his enemy by the belt with both hands, andjumped back into the stable, shouting:

"Come in and meet Tash yourself!"

There was a deafening noise. As when the Ape had been flung in, the earth shook andthere was a blinding light.

The Calormene soldiers outside screamed. "Tash, Tash!" and banged the door. If Tashwanted their own Captain, Tash must have him. They, at any rate, did not want to meetTash.

For a moment or two Tirian did not know where he was or even who he was. Then hesteadied himself, blinked, and looked around. It was not dark inside the stable, as he hadexpected. He was in strong light: that was why he was blinking.

He turned to look at Rishda Tarkaan, but Rishda was not looking at him. Rishda gave agreat wail and pointed; then he put his hands before his face and fell flat, facedownwards, on the ground. Tirian looked in the direction where the Tarkaan had pointed.

And then he understood.

A terrible figure was coming towards them. It was far smaller than the shape they hadseen from the Tower, though still much bigger than a man, and it was the same. It had avulture's head and four arms. Its beak was open and its eyes blazed. A croaking voicecame from its beak.

"Thou hast called me into Narnia, Rishda Tarkaan. Here I am. What hast thou to say?"

But the Tarkaan neither lifted his face from the ground nor said a word. He was shakinglike a man with a bad hiccup. He was brave enough in battle: but half his courage had lefthim earlier that night when he first began to suspect that there might be a real Tash. Therest of it had left him now.

With a sudden jerk -like a hen stooping to pick up a worm - Tash pounced on themiserable Rishda and tucked him under the upper of his two right arms. Then Tash turnedhis head sidewise to fix Tirian with one of his terrible eyes: for of course, having a bird'shead, he couldn't look at you straight.

But immediately, from behind Tash, strong and calm as the summer sea, a voice said:

"Begone, Monster, and take your lawful prey to your own place: in the name of Aslanand Aslan's great Father the Emperor-over-the-Sea."

The hideous creature vanished, with the Tarkaan still under its arm. And Tirian turned tosee who had spoken.

And what he saw then set his heart beating as it had never beaten in any fight.

Seven Kings and Queens stood before him, all with crowns on their heads and all inglittering clothes, but the Kings wore fine mail as well and had their swords drawn intheir hands. Tirian bowed courteously and was about to speak when the youngest of theQueens laughed. He stared hard at her face, and then gasped with amazement, for heknew her. It was Jill: but not Jill as he had last seen her, with her face all dirt and tearsand an old drill dress half slipping off one shoulder. Now she looked cool and fresh, asfresh as if she had just come from bathing. And at first he thought she looked older, butthen didn't, and he could never make up his mind on that point. And then he saw that theyoungest of the Kings was Eustace: but he also was changed as Jill was changed.

Tirian suddenly felt awkward about coming among these people with the blood and dustand sweat of a battle still on him. Next moment he realized that he was not in that state atall. He was fresh and cool and clean, and dressed in such clothes as he would have wornfor a great feast at Cair Paravel. (But in Narnia your good clothes were never youruncomfortable ones. They knew how to make things that felt beautiful as well as lookingbeautiful in Narnia: and there was no such thing as starch or flannel or elastic to be foundfrom one end of the country to the other.)

"Sire," said Jill coming forward and making a beautiful curtsey, "let me make you knownto Peter the High King over all Kings in Narnia."

Tirian had no need to ask which was the High King, for he remembered his face (thoughhere it was far nobler) from his dream. He stepped forward, sank on one knee and kissedPeter's hand.

"High King," he said. "You are welcome to me."

And the High King raised him and kissed him on both cheeks as a High King should.

Then he led him to the eldest of the Queens - but even she was not old, and there were nogrey hairs on her head and no wrinkles on her cheek - and said, "Sir, this is that LadyPolly who came into Narnia on the First Day, when Aslan made the trees grow and theBeasts talk." He brought him next to a man whose golden beard flowed over his breastand whose face was full of wisdom. "And this," he said, "is the Lord Digory who waswith her on that day. And this is my brother, King Edmund: and this my sister, the QueenLucy."

"Sir," said Tirian, when he had greeted all these. "If I have read the chronicle aright, thereshould be another. Has not your Majesty two sisters? Where is Queen Susan?"

"My sister Susan," answered Peter shortly and gravely, "is no longer a friend of Narnia."

"Yes," said Eustace, "and whenever you've tried to get her to come and talk about Narniaor do anything about Narnia, she says, `What wonderful memories you have! Fancy yourstill thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children.'"

"Oh Susan!" said Jill. "She's interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstickand invitations. She always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown-up."

"Grown-up, indeed," said the Lady Polly. "I wish she would grow up. She wasted all herschool time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all the rest of her life tryingto stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick asshe can and then stop there as long as she can."

"Well, don't let's talk about that now," said Peter. "Look! Here are lovely fruit-trees. Letus taste them."

And then, for the first time, Tirian looked about him and realized how very queer thisadventure was.
