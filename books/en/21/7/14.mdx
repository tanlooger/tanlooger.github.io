title: CHAPTER 14. NIGHT FALLS ON NARNIA
---

THEY all stood beside Aslan, on his right side, and looked through the open doorway.

The bonfire had gone out. On the earth all was blackness: in fact you could not have toldthat you were looking into a wood if you had not seen where the dark shapes of the treesended and the stars began. But when Aslan had roared yet again, out on their left theysaw another black shape. That is, they saw another patch where there were no stars: andthe patch rose up higher and higher and became the shape of a man, the hugest of allgiants. They all knew Narnia well enough to work out where he must be standing. Hemust be on the high moorlands that stretch away to the North beyond the River Shribble.

Then Jill and Eustace remembered how once long ago, in the deep caves beneath thosemoors, they had seen a great giant asleep and been told that his name was Father Time,and that he would wake on the day the world ended.

"Yes," said Aslan, though they had not spoken. "While he lay dreaming his name wasTime. Now that he is awake he will have a new one."

Then the great giant raised a horn to his mouth. They could see this by the change of theblack shape he made against the stars. After that - quite a bit later, because sound travelsso slowly - they heard the sound of the horn: high and terrible, yet of a strange, deadlybeauty.

Immediately the sky became full of shooting stars. Even one shooting star is a fine thingto see; but these were dozens, and then scores, and then hundreds, till it was like silverrain: and it went on and on. And when it had gone on for some while, one or two of thembegan to think that there was another dark shape against the sky as well as the giant's. Itwas in a different place, right overhead, up in the very roof of the sky as you might call it.

"Perhaps it is a cloud," thought Edmund. At any rate, there were no stars there: justblackness. But all around, the downpour of stars went on. And then the starless patch

began to grow, spreading further and further out from the centre of the sky. And presentlya quarter of the whole sky was black, and then a half, and at last the rain of shooting starswas going on only low down near the horizon.

With a thrill of wonder (and there was some terror in it too) they all suddenly realizedwhat was happening. The spreading blackness was not a cloud at all: it was simplyemptiness. The black part of the sky was the part in which there were no stars left. All thestars were falling: Aslan had called them home.

The last few seconds before the rain of stars had quite ended were very exciting. Starsbegan falling all round them. But stars in that world are not the great flaming globes theyare in ours. They are people (Edmund and Lucy had once met one). So now they foundshowers of glittering people, all with long hair like burning silver and spears like white-

hot metal, rushing down to them out of the black air, swifter than falling stones. Theymade a hissing noise as they landed and burnt the grass. And all these stars glided pastthem and stood somewhere behind, a little to the right.

This was a great advantage, because otherwise, now that there were no stars in the sky,everything would have been completely dark and you could have seen nothing. As it was,the crowd of stars behind them cast a fierce, white light over their shoulders. They couldsee mile upon mile of Narnian woods spread out before them, looking as if they werefloodlit. Every bush and almost every blade of grass had its black shadow behind it. Theedge of every leaf stood out so sharp that you'd think you could cut your finger on it.

On the grass before them lay their own shadows. But the great thing was Aslan's shadow.

It streamed away to their left, enormous and very terrible. And all this was under a skythat would now be starless forever.

The light from behind them (and a little to their right) was so strong that it lit up even theslopes of the Northern Moors. Something was moving there. Enormous animals werecrawling and sliding down into Narnia: great dragons and giant lizards and featherlessbirds with wings like bats' wings. They disappeared into the woods and for a few minutesthere was silence. Then there came - at first from very far off - sounds of wailing andthen, from every direction, a rustling and a pattering and a sound of wings. It came nearerand nearer. Soon one could distinguish the scamper of little feet from the padding of bigpaws, and the clack-clack of light little hoofs from the thunder of great ones. And thenone could see thousands of pairs of eyes gleaming. And at last, out of the shadow of thetrees, racing up the hill for dear life, by thousands and by millions, came all kinds ofcreatures - Talking Beasts, Dwarfs, Satyrs, Fauns, Giants, Calormenes, men fromArchenland, Monopods, and strange unearthly things from the remote islands of theunknown Western lands. And all these ran up to the doorway where Aslan stood.

This part of the adventure was the only one which seemed rather like a dream at the timeand rather hard to remember properly afterwards. Especially, one couldn't say how long ithad taken. Sometimes it seemed to have lasted only a few minutes, but at others it felt asif it might have gone on for years. Obviously, unless either the Door had grown very

much larger or the creatures had suddenly grown as small as gnats, a crowd like thatcouldn't ever have tried to get through it. But no one thought about that sort of thing atthe time.

The creatures came rushing on, their eyes brighter and brighter as they drew nearer andnearer to the standing Stars. But as they came right up to Aslan one or other of two thingshappened to each of them. They all looked straight in his face, I don't think they had anychoice about that. And when some looked, the expression of their faces changed terribly -

it was fear and hatred: except that, on the faces of Talking Bears, the fear and hatredlasted only for a fraction of a second. You could see that they suddenly ceased to theTalking Beasts. They were just ordinary animals. And all the creatures who looked atAslan in that way swerved to their right, his left, and disappeared into his huge blackshadow, which (as you have heard) streamed away to the left of the doorway. Thechildren never saw them again. I don't know what became of them. But the others lookedin the face of Aslan and loved him, though some of them were very frightened at thesame time. And all these came in at the Door, in on Aslan's right. There were some queerspecimens among them. Eustace even recognized one of those very Dwarfs who hadhelped to shoot the Horses. But he had no time to wonder about that sort of thing (andanyway it was no business of his) for a great joy put everything else out of his head.

Among the happy creatures who now came crowding round Tirian and his friends wereall those whom they had thought dead. There was Roonwit the Centaur and Jewel theUnicorn and the good Boar and the good Bear, and Farsight the Eagle, and the dear Dogsand the Horses, and Poggin the Dwarf.

"Further in and higher up!" cried Roonwit and thundered away in a gallop to the West.

And though they did not understand him, the words somehow set them tingling all over.

The Boar grunted at them cheerfully. The Bear was just going to mutter that he still didn'tunderstand, when he caught sight of the fruit-trees behind them. He waddled to thosetrees as fast as he could and there, no doubt, found something he understood very well.

But the Dogs remained, wagging their tails, and Poggin remained, shaking hands witheveryone and grinning all over his honest face. And Jewel leaned his snowy white headover the King's shoulder and the King whispered in Jewel's ear. Then everyone turned hisattention again to what could be seen through the Doorway.

The Dragons and Giant Lizards now had Narnia to themselves. They went to and frotearing up the trees by the roots and crunching them up as if they were sticks of rhubarb.

Minute by minute the forests disappeared. The whole country became bare and you couldsee all sorts of things about its shape - all the little humps and hollows which you hadnever noticed before. The grass died. Soon Tirian found that he was looking at a world ofbare rock and earth. You could hardly believe that anything had ever lived there. Themonsters themselves grew old and lay down and died. Their flesh shrivelled up and thebones appeared: soon they were only huge skeletons that lay here and there on the deadrock, looking as if they had died thousands of years ago. For a long time everything wasstill.

At last something white - a long, level line of whiteness that gleamed in the light of thestanding stars - came moving towards them from the Eastern end of the world.

A widespread noise broke the silence: first a murmur then a rumble, then a roar. And nowthey could see what it was that was coming, and how fast it came. It was a foaming wallof water. The sea was rising. In that tree-less world you could see it very well. You couldsee all the rivers getting wider and the lakes getting larger, and separate lakes joining intoone, and valleys turning into new lakes, and hills turning into islands, and then thoseislands vanishing. And the high moors to their left and the higher mountains to their rightcrumbled and slipped down with a roar and a splash into the mounting water; and thewater came swirling up to the very threshold of the Doorway (but never passed it) so thatthe foam splashed about Aslan's forefeet. All now was level water from where they stoodto where the waters met the sky.

And out there it began to grow light. A streak of dreary and disastrous dawn spread alongthe horizon, and widened and grew brighter, till in the end they hardly noticed the light ofthe stars who stood behind them. At last the sun came up. When it did, the Lord Digoryand the Lady Polly looked at one another and gave a little nod: those two, in a differentworld, had once seen a dying sun, and so they knew at once that this sun also was dying.

It was three times - twenty times - as big as it ought to be, and very dark red. As its raysfell upon the great Time-giant, he turned red too: and in the reflection of that sun thewhole waste of shoreless waters looked like blood.

Then the Moon came up, quite in her wrong position, very close to the sun, and she alsolooked red. And at the sight of her the sun began shooting out great flames, like whiskersor snakes of crimson fire, towards her. It is as if he were an octopus trying to draw her tohimself in his tentacles. And perhaps he did draw her. At any rate she came to him,slowly at first, but then more and more quickly, till at last his long flames licked roundher and the two ran together and became one huge ball like a burning coal. Great lumpsof fire came dropping out of it into the sea and clouds of steam rose up.

Then Aslan said, "Now make an end."

The giant threw his horn into the sea. Then he stretched out one arm - very black itlooked, and thousands of miles long - across the sky till his hand reached the Sun. Hetook the Sun and squeezed it in his hand as you would squeeze an orange. And instantlythere was total darkness.

Everyone except Aslan jumped back from the ice-cold air which now blew through theDoorway. Its edges were already covered with icicles.

"Peter, High King of Narnia," said Aslan. "Shut the Door."

Peter, shivering with cold, leaned out into the darkness and pulled the Door to. It scrapedover ice as he pulled it. Then, rather clumsily (for even in that moment his hands hadgone numb and blue) he took out a golden key and locked it.

They had seen strange things enough through that Doorway. But it was stranger than anyof them to look round and find themselves in warm daylight, the blue sky above them,flowers at their feet, and laughter in Aslan's eyes.

He turned swiftly round, crouched lower, lashed himself with his tail and shot away like agolden arrow.

"Come further in! Come further up!" he shouted over his shoulder. But who could keepup with him at that pace? They set out walking Westward to follow him.

"So," said Peter, "night falls on Narnia. What, Lucy! You're not crying? With Aslanahead, and all of us here?"

"Don't try to stop me, Peter," said Lucy, "I am sure Aslan would not. I am sure it is notwrong to mourn for Narnia. Think of all that lies dead and frozen behind that door."

"Yes and I did hope," said Jill, "that it might go on for ever. I knew our world couldn't. Idid think Narnia might."

"I saw it begin," said the Lord Digory. "I did not think I would live to see it die."

"Sirs," said Tirian. "The ladies do well to weep. See, I do so myself. I have seen mymother's death. What world but Narnia have I ever known? It were no virtue, but greatdiscourtesy, if we did not mourn."

They walked away from the Door and away from the Dwarfs who still sat crowdedtogether in their imaginary stable. And as they went they talked to one another about oldwars and old peace and ancient Kings and all the glories of Narnia.

The Dogs were still with them. They joined in the conversation but not much becausethey were too busy racing on ahead and racing back and rushing off to sniff at smells inthe grass till they made themselves sneeze. Suddenly they picked up a scent whichseemed to excite them very much. They all started arguing about it - "Yes it is - No it isn't- That's just what I said - anyone can smell what that is - Take your great nose out of theway and let someone else smell."

"What is it, cousins?" said Peter.

"A Calormene, Sire," said several Dogs at once.

"Lead on to him, then," said Peter. "Whether he meets us in peace or war, he shall bewelcome."

The Dogs darted on ahead and came back a moment later, running as if their livesdepended on it, and barking loudly to say that it really was a Calormene. (Talking Dogs,

just like the common ones, behave as if they thought whatever they are doing at themoment immensely important.)

The others followed where the Dogs led them and found a young Calormene sitting undera chestnut tree beside a clear stream of water. It was Emeth. He rose at once and bowedgravely.

"Sir," he said to Peter, "I know not whether you are my friend or my foe, but I shouldcount it my honour to have you for either. Has not one of the poets said that a noblefriend is the best gift and a noble enemy the next best?"

"Sir," said Peter, "I do not know that there need be any war between you and us."

"Do tell us who you are and what's happened to you," said Jill.

"If there's going to be a story, let's all have a drink and sit down," barked the Dogs.

"We're quite blown."

"Well of course you will be if you keep tearing about the way you have done," saidEustace.

So the humans sat down on the grass. And when the Dogs had all had a very noisy drinkout of the stream they all sat down, bolt upright, panting, with their tongues hanging outof their heads a little on one side to hear the story. But Jewel remained standing,polishing his horn against his side.
