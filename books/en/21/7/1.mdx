title: CHAPTER 1. BY CALDRON POOL
---

IN the last days of Narnia, far up to the west beyond Lantern Waste and close beside thegreat waterfall, there lived an Ape. He was so old that no one could remember when hehad first come to live in those parts, and he was the cleverest, ugliest, most wrinkled Apeyou can imagine. He had a little house, built of wood and thatched with leaves, up in thefork of a great tree, and his name was Shift. There were very few Talking Beasts or Menor Dwarfs, or people of any sort, in that part of the wood, but Shift had one friend andneighbour who was a donkey called Puzzle. At least they both said they were friends, butfrom the way things went on you might have thought Puzzle was more like Shift's servantthan his friend. He did all the work. When they went together to the river, Shift filled thebig skin bottles with water but it was Puzzle who carried them back. When they wantedanything from the towns further down the river it was Puzzle who went down with emptypanniers on his back and came back with the panniers full and heavy. And all the nicestthings that Puzzle brought back were eaten by Shift; for as Shift said, "You see, Puzzle, Ican't eat grass and thistles like you, so it's only fair I should make it up in other ways."And Puzzle always said, "Of course, Shift, of course. I see that." Puzzle nevercomplained, because he knew that Shift was far cleverer than himself and he thought itwas very kind of Shift to be friends with him at all. And if ever Puzzle did try to argueabout anything, Shift would always say, "Now, Puzzle, I understand what needs to bedone better than you. You know you're not clever, Puzzle." And Puzzle always said, "No,Shift. It's quite true. I'm not clever." Then he would sigh and do whatever Shift had said.

One morning early in the year the pair of them were out walking along the shore ofCaldron Pool. Caldron Pool is the big pool right under the cliffs at the western end ofNarnia. The great waterfall pours down into it with a noise like everlasting thunder, andthe River of Narnia flows out on the other side. The waterfall keeps the Pool alwaysdancing and bubbling and churning round and round as if it were on the boil, and that ofcourse is how it got its name of Caldron Pool. It is liveliest in the early spring when thewaterfall is swollen with all the snow that has melted off the mountains from up beyondNarnia in the Western Wild from which the river comes. And as they looked at CaldronPool Shift suddenly pointed with his dark, skinny finger and said,

"Look! What's that?"

"What's what?" said Puzzle.

"That yellow thing that's just come down the waterfall. Look! There it is again, it'sfloating. We must find out what it is."

"Must we?" said Puzzle.

"Of course we must," said Shift. "It may be something useful. Just hop into the Pool likea good fellow and fish it out. Then we can have a proper look at it."

"Hop into the Pool?" said Puzzle, twitching his long ears.

"Well how are we to get it if you don't?" said the Ape.

"But - but," said Puzzle, "wouldn't it be better if you went in? Because, you see, it's youwho wants to know what it is, and I don't much. And you've got hands, you see. You're asgood as a Man or a Dwarf when it comes to catching hold of things. I've only got hoofs."

"Really, Puzzle," said Shift, "I didn't think you'd ever say a thing like that. I didn't think itof you, really."

"Why, what have I said wrong?" said the Ass, speaking in rather a humble voice, for hesaw that Shift was very deeply offended. "All I meant was -"

"Wanting me to go into the water," said the Ape. "As if you didn't know perfectly wellwhat weak chests Apes always have and how easily they catch cold! Very well. I will goin. I'm feeling cold enough already in this cruel wind. But I'll go in. I shall probably die.

Then you'll be sorry." And Shift's voice sounded as if he was just going to burst intotears.

"Please don't, please don't, please don't," said Puzzle, half braying, and half talking. "Inever meant anything of the sort, Shift, really I didn't. You know how stupid I am andhow I can't think of more than one thing at a time. I'd forgotten about your weak chest. Ofcourse I'll go in. You mustn't think of doing it yourself. Promise me you won't, Shift."

So Shift promised, and Puzzle went cloppety-clop on his four hoofs round the rocky edgeof the Pool to find a place where he could get in. Quite apart from the cold it was no jokegetting into that quivering and foaming water, and Puzzle had to stand and shiver for awhole minute before he made up his mind to do it. But then Shift called out from behindhim and said: "Perhaps I'd better do it after all, Puzzle." And when Puzzle heard that hesaid, "No, no. You promised. I'm in now," and in he went.

A great mass of foam got him in the face and filled his mouth with water and blindedhim. Then he went under altogether for a few seconds, and when he came up again hewas in quite another part of the Pool. Then the swirl caught him and carried him roundand round and faster and faster till it took him right under the waterfall itself, and theforce of the water plunged him down, deep down, so that he thought he would never be

able to hold his breath till he came up again. And when he had come up and when at lasthe got somewhere near the thing he was trying to catch, it sailed away from him till it toogot under the fall and was forced down to the bottom. When it came up again it wasfurther from him than ever. But at last, when he was almost tired to death, and bruised allover and numb with cold, he succeeded in gripping the thing with his teeth. And out hecame carrying it in front of him and getting his front hoofs tangled up in it, for it was asbig as a large hearthrug, and it was very heavy and cold and slimy.

He flung it down in front of Shift and stood dripping and shivering and trying to get hisbreath back. But the Ape never looked at him or asked him how he felt. The Ape was toobusy going round and round the Thing and spreading it out and patting it and smelling it.

Then a wicked gleam came into his eye and he said:

"It is a lion's skin."

"Ee - auh - auh - oh, is it?" gasped Puzzle.

"Now I wonder . . . I wonder . . . I wonder," said Shift to himself, for he was thinkingvery hard.

"I wonder who killed the poor lion," said Puzzle presently. "It ought to be buried. Wemust have a funeral."

"Oh, it wasn't a Talking Lion," said Shift. "You needn't bother about that. There are noTalking Beasts up beyond the Falls, up in the Western Wild. This skin must havebelonged to a dumb, wild lion."

This, by the way, was true. A Hunter, a Man, had killed and skinned this lion somewhereup in the Western Wild several months before. But that doesn't come into this story.

"All the same, Shift," said Puzzle, "even if the skin only belonged to a dumb, wild lion,oughtn't we to give it a decent burial? I mean, aren't all lions rather - well, rather solemn?

Because of you know Who. Don't you see?"

"Don't you start getting ideas into your head, Puzzle," said Shift. "Because, you know,thinking isn't your strong point. We'll make this skin into a fine warm winter coat foryou."

"Oh, I don't think I'd like that," said the Donkey. "It would look - I mean, the other Beastsmight think - that is to say, I shouldn't feel -"

"What are you talking about?" said Shift, scratching himself the wrong way up as Apesdo.

"I don't think it would be respectful to the Great Lion, to Aslan himself, if an ass like mewent about dressed up in a lion-skin," said Puzzle.

"Now don't stand arguing, please," said Shift. "What does an ass like you know aboutthings of that sort? You know you're no good at thinking, Puzzle, so why don't you let medo your thinking for you? Why don't you treat me as I treat you? I don't think I can doeverything. I know you're better at some things than I am. That's why I let you go into thePool; I knew you'd do it better than me. But why can't I have my turn when it comes tosomething I can do and you can't? Am I never to be allowed to do anything? Do be fair.

Turn and turn about."

"Oh, well, of course, if you put it that way," said Puzzle.

"I tell you what," said Shift. "You'd better take a good brisk trot down river as far asChippingford and see if they have any oranges or bananas."

"But I'm so tired, Shift," pleaded Puzzle.

"Yes, but you are very cold and wet," said the Ape. "You want something to warm youup. A brisk trot would be just the thing. Besides, it's market day at Chippingford today."And then of course Puzzle said he would go.

As soon as he was alone Shift went shambling along, sometimes on two paws andsometimes on four, till he reached his own tree. Then he swung himself up from branchto branch, chattering and grinning all the time, and went into his little house. He foundneedle and thread and a big pair of scissors there; for he was a clever Ape and the Dwarfshad taught him how to sew. He put the ball of thread (it was very thick stuff, more likecord than thread) into his mouth so that his cheek bulged out as if he were sucking a bigbit of toffee. He held the needle between his lips and took the scissors in his left paw.

Then he came down the tree and shambled across to the lion-skin. He squatted down andgot to work.

He saw at once that the body of the lion-skin would be too long for Puzzle and its necktoo short. So he cut a good piece out of the body and used it to make a long collar forPuzzle's long neck. Then he cut off the head and sewed the collar in between the head andthe shoulders. He put threads on both sides of the skin so that it would tie up underPuzzle's chest and stomach. Every now and then a bird would pass overhead and Shiftwould stop his work, looking anxiously up. He did not want anyone to see what he wasdoing. But none of the birds he saw were Talking Birds, so it didn't matter.

Late in the afternoon Puzzle came back. He was not trotting but only plodding patientlyalong, the way donkeys do.

"There weren't any oranges," he said, "and there weren't any bananas. And I'm verytired." He lay down.

"Come and try on your beautiful new lion-skin coat," said Shift.

"Oh bother that old skin," said Puzzle. "I'll try it on in the morning. I'm too tired tonight."

"You are unkind, Puzzle," said Shift. "If you're tired what do you think I am? All daylong, while you've been having a lovely refreshing walk down the valley, I've beenworking hard to make you a coat. My paws are so tired I can hardly hold these scissors.

And you won't say thank you -and you won't even look at the coat -and you don't care -

and- and-"

"My dear Shift," said Puzzle getting up at once, "I am so sorry. I've been horrid. Ofcourse I'd love to try it on. And it looks simply splendid. Do try it on me at once. Pleasedo."

"Well, stand still then," said the Ape. The skin was very heavy for him to lift, but in theend, with a lot of pulling and pushing and puffing and blowing, he got it on to thedonkey. He tied it underneath Puzzle's body and he tied the legs to Puzzle's legs and thetail to Puzzle's tail. A good deal of Puzzle's grey nose and face could be seen through theopen mouth of the lion's head. No one who had ever seen a real lion would have beentaken in for a moment. But if someone who had never seen a lion looked at Puzzle in hislion-skin he just might mistake him for a lion, if he didn't come too close, and if the lightwas not too good, and if Puzzle didn't let out a bray and didn't make any noise with hishoofs.

"You look wonderful, wonderful," said the Ape. "If anyone saw you now, they'd thinkyou were Aslan, the Great Lion, himself."

"That would be dreadful," said Puzzle.

"No it wouldn't," said Shift. "Everyone would do whatever you told them."

"But I don't want to tell them anything."

"But you think of the good we could do!" said Shift. "You'd have me to advise you, youknow. I'd think of sensible orders for you to give. And everyone would have to obey us,even the King himself. We would set everything right in Narnia."

"But isn't everything right already?" said Puzzle.

"What!" cried Shift. "Everything right?-when there are no oranges or bananas?"

"Well, you know," said Puzzle, "there aren't many people - in fact, I don't think there'sanyone but yourself who wants those sort of things."

"There's sugar too," said Shift.

"H'm yes," said the Ass. "It would be nice if there was more sugar."

"Well then, that's settled," said the Ape. "You will pretend to be Aslan, and I'll tell youwhat to say."

"No, no, no," said Puzzle. "Don't say such dreadful things. It would be wrong, Shift. Imaybe not very clever but I know that much. What would become of us if the real Aslanturned up?"

"I expect he'd be very pleased," said Shift. "Probably he sent us the lion-skin on purpose,so that we could set things to right. Anyway, he never does turn up, you know. Notnowadays."

At that moment there came a great thunderclap right overhead and the ground trembledwith a small earthquake. Both the animals lost their balance and were flung on theirfaces.

"There!" gasped Puzzle, as soon as he had breath to speak. "It's a sign, a warning. I knewwe were doing something dreadfully wicked. Take this wretched skin off me at once."

"No, no," said the Ape (whose mind worked very quickly). "It's a sign the other way. Iwas just going to say that if the real Aslan, as you call him, meant us to go on with this,he would send us a thunderclap and an earth-tremor. It was just on the tip of my tongue,only the sign itself came before I could get the words out. You've got to do it now,Puzzle. And please don't let us have any more arguing. You know you don't understandthese things. What could a donkey know about signs?"
