title: CHAPTER 3. THE APE IN ITS GLORY
---

"MASTER Horse, Master Horse," said Tirian as he hastily cut its traces, "how came thesealiens to enslave you? Is Narnia conquered? Has there been a battle?"

"No, Sire," panted the horse, "Aslan is here. It is all by his orders. He has commanded -"

"'Ware danger, King," said Jewel. Tirian looked up and saw that Calormenes (mixed witha few Talking Beasts) were beginning to run towards them from every direction. The twodead men had died without a cry and so it had taken a moment before the rest of thecrowd knew what had happened. But now they did. Most of them had naked scimitars intheir hands.

"Quick. On my back," said Jewel.

The King flung himself astride of his old friend who turned and galloped away. Hechanged direction twice or thrice as soon as they were out of sight of their enemies,crossed a stream, and shouted without slackening his pace, "Whither away, Sire? To CairParavel?"

"Hold hard, friend," said Tirian. "Let me off." He slid off the Unicorn's back and facedhim.

"Jewel," said the King. "We have done a dreadful deed."

"We were sorely provoked," said Jewel.

"But to leap on them unawares - without defying them while they were unarmed - faugh!

We are two murderers, Jewel. I am dishonoured forever."

Jewel drooped his head. He too was ashamed.

"And then," said the King, "the Horse said it was by Aslan's orders. The Rat said thesame. They all say Aslan is here. How if it were true?"

"But, Sire, how could Aslan be commanding such dreadful things?"

"He is not a tame lion," said Tirian. "How should we know what he would do? We, whoare murderers. Jewel, I will go back. I will give up my sword and put myself in the handsof these Calormenes and ask that they bring me before Aslan. Let him do justice on me."

"You will go to your death, then," said Jewel.

"Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?" said the King. "That would benothing, nothing at all. Would it not be better to be dead than to have this horrible fearthat Aslan has come and is not like the Aslan we have believed in and longed for? It is asif the sun rose one day and were a black sun."

"I know," said Jewel. "Or as if you drank water and it were dry water. You are in theright, Sire. This is the end of all things. Let us go and give ourselves up."

"There is no need for both of us to go."

"If ever we loved one another, let me go with you now," said the Unicorn. "If you aredead and if Aslan is not Aslan, what life is left for me?"

They turned and walked back together, shedding bitter tears.

As soon as they came to the place where the work was going on the Calormenes raised acry and came towards them with their weapons in hand. But the King held out his swordwith the hilt towards them and said:

"I who was King of Narnia and am now a dishonoured knight give myself up to thejustice of Aslan. Bring me before him."

"And I give myself up too," said Jewel.

Then the dark men came round them in a thick crowd, smelling of garlic and onions, theirwhite eyes flashing dreadfully in their brown faces. They put a rope halter round Jewel'sneck. They took the King's sword away and tied his hands behind his back. One of theCalormenes, who had a helmet instead of a turban and seemed to be in command,snatched the gold circlet off Tirian's head and hastily put it away somewhere among hisclothes. They led the two prisoners uphill to a place where there was a big clearing. Andthis was what the prisoners saw. At the centre of the clearing, which was also thehighest point of the hill, there was a little hut like a stable, with a thatched roof. Its doorwas shut. On the grass in front of the door there sat an Ape. Tirian and Jewel, who hadbeen expecting to see Aslan and had heard nothing about an Ape yet, were verybewildered when they saw it. The Ape was of course Shift himself, but he looked tentimes uglier than when he lived by Caldron Pool, for he was now dress- ed up. He waswearing a scarlet jacket which did not fit him very well, having been made for a dwarf.

He had Jewelled slippers on his hind paws which would not stay on properly because, asyou know, the hind paws of an Ape are really like hands. He wore what seemed to be apaper crown on his head. There was a great pile of nuts beside him and he kept crackingnuts with his jaws and spitting out the shells. And he also kept on pulling up the scarletjacket to scratch himself. A great number of Talking Beasts stood facing him, and nearlyevery face in that crowd looked miserably worried and bewildered. When they saw whothe prisoners were they all groaned and whimpered.

"O Lord Shift, mouthpiece of Aslan," said the chief Calormene. "We bring you prisoners.

By our skill and courage and by the permission of the great god Tash we have taken alivethese two desperate murderers."

"Give me that man's sword," said the Ape. So they took the King's sword and handed it,with the sword-belt and all, to the monkey. And he hung it round his own neck: and itmade him look sillier than ever.

"We'll see about those two later," said the Ape, spitting out a shell in the direction of thetwo prisoners. "I got some other business first. They can wait. Now listen to me,everyone. The first thing I want to say is about nuts. Where's that Head Squirrel got to?"

"Here, Sir," said a red squirrel, coming forward and making a nervous little bow.

"Oh you are, are you?" said the Ape with a nasty look. "Now attend to me. I want - Imean, Aslan wants - some more nuts. These you've brought aren't anything like enough.

You must bring some more, do you hear? Twice as many. And they've got to be here bysunset tomorrow, and there mustn't be any bad ones or any small ones among them."

A murmur of dismay ran through the other squirrels, and the Head Squirrel plucked upcourage to say:

"Please, would Aslan himself speak to us about it? If we might be allowed to see him -"

"Well you won't," said the Ape. "He may be very kind (though it's a lot more than mostof you deserve) and come out for a few minutes tonight. Then you can all have a look athim. But he will not have you all crowding round him and pestering him with questions.

Anything you want to say to him will be passed on through me: if I think it's worthbothering him about. In the meantime all you squirrels had better go and see about thenuts. And make sure they are here by tomorrow evening or, my word! you'll catch it."

The poor squirrels all scampered away as if a dog were after them. This new order wasterrible news for them. The nuts they had carefully hoarded for the winter had nearly allbeen eaten by now; and of the few that were left they had already given the Ape far morethan they could spare.

Then a deep voice - it belonged to a great tusked and shaggy Boar - spoke from anotherpart of the crowd.

"But why can't we see Aslan properly and talk to him?" it said. "When he used to appearin Narnia in the old days everyone could talk to him face to face."

"Don't you believe it," said the Ape. "And even if it was true, times have changed. Aslansays he's been far too soft with you before, do you see? Well, he isn't going to be soft anymore. He's going to lick you into shape this time. He'll teach you to think he's a tamelion!"

A low moaning and whimpering was heard among the Beasts; and, after that, a deadsilence which was more miserable still.

"And now there's another thing you got to learn," said the Ape. "I hear some of you aresaying I'm an Ape. Well, I'm not. I'm a Man. If I look like an Ape, that's because I'm sovery old: hundreds and hundreds of years old. And it's because I'm so old that I'm sowise. And it's because I'm so wise that I'm the only one Aslan is ever going to speak to.

He can't be bothered talking to a lot of stupid animals. He'll tell me what you've got to do,and I'll tell the rest of you. And take my advice, and see you do it in double quick time,for he doesn't mean to stand any nonsense."

There was a dead silence except for the noise of a very young badger crying and itsmother trying to make it keep quiet.

"And now here's another thing," the Ape went on, fitting a fresh nut into its cheek, "I hearsome of the horses are saying, Let's hurry up and get this job of carting timber over asquickly as we can, and then we'll be free again. Well, you can get that idea out of yourheads at once. And not only the Horses either. Everybody who can work is going to bemade to work in future. Aslan has it all settled with the King of Calormen - The Tisroc,as our dark faced friends the Calormenes call him. All you Horses and Bulls and Donkeysare to be sent down into Calormen to work for your living - pulling and carrying the wayhorses and such-like do in other countries. And all you digging animals like Moles andRabbits and Dwarfs are going down to work in The Tisroc's mines. And -"

"No, no, no," howled the Beasts. "It can't be true. Aslan would never sell us into slaveryto the King of Calormen."

"None of that! Hold your noise!" said the Ape with a snarl. "Who said anything aboutslavery? You won't be slaves. You'll be paid - very good wages too. That is to say, yourpay will be paid into Aslan's treasury and he will use it all for everybody's good." Thenhe glanced, and almost winked, at the chief Calormene. The Calormene bowed andreplied, in the pompous Calormene way:

"Most sapient Mouthpiece of Aslan, The Tisroc (may he-live-forever) is wholly of onemind with your lordship in this judicious plan."

"There! You see!" said the Ape. "It's all arranged. And all for your own good. We'll beable, with the money you earn, to make Narnia a country worth living in. There'll beoranges and bananas pouring in - and roads and big cities and schools and offices andwhips and muzzles and saddles and cages and kennels and prisons - Oh, everything."

"But we don't want all those things," said an old Bear. "We want to be free. And we wantto hear Aslan speak himself."

"Now don't you start arguing," said the Ape, "for it's a thing I won't stand. I'm a Man:you're only a fat, stupid old Bear. What do you know about freedom? You think freedommeans doing what you like. Well, you're wrong. That isn't true freedom. True freedommeans doing what I tell you."

"H-n-n-h," grunted the Bear and scratched its head; it found this sort of thing hard tounderstand.

"Please, please," said the high voice of a woolly lamb, who was so young that everyonewas surprised he dared to speak at all.

"What is it now?" said the Ape. "Be quick."

"Please," said the Lamb, "I can't understand. What have we to do with the Calormenes?

We belong to Aslan. They belong to Tash. They have a god called Tash. They say he hasfour arms and the head of a vulture. They kill Men on his altar. I don't believe there's anysuch person as Tash. But if there was, how could Aslan be friends with him?"

All the animals cocked their heads sideways and all their bright eyes flashed towards theApe. They knew it was the best question anyone had asked yet.

The Ape jumped up and spat at the Lamb.

"Baby!" he hissed. "Silly little bleater! Go home to your mother and drink milk. What doyou understand of such things? But the others, listen. Tash is only another name forAslan. All that old idea of us being right and the Calormenes wrong is silly. We knowbetter now. The Calormenes use different words but we all mean the same thing. Tashand Aslan are only two different names for you know Who. That's why there can neverbe any quarrel between them. Get that into your heads, you stupid brutes. Tash is Aslan:Aslan is Tash."

You know how sad your own dog's face can look sometimes. Think of that and then thinkof all the faces of those Talking Beasts - all those honest, humble, bewildered Birds,Bears, Badgers, Rabbits, Moles, and Mice - all far sadder than that. Every tail was down,every whisker drooped. It would have broken your heart with very pity to see their faces.

There was only one who did not look at all unhappy.

It was a ginger Cat - a great big Tom in the prime of life - who sat bolt upright with histail curled round his toes, in the very front row of all the Beasts. He had been staring hardat the Ape and the Calormene captain all the time and had never once blinked his eyes.

"Excuse me," said the Cat very politely, "but this interests me. Does your friend fromCalormen say the same?"

"Assuredly," said the Calormene. "The enlightened Ape - Man, I mean - is in the right.

Aslan means neither less nor more than Tash."

"Especially, Aslan means no more than Tash?" suggested the Cat.

"No more at all," said the Calormene, looking the Cat straight in the face.

"Is that good enough for you, Ginger?" said the Ape.

"Oh certainly," said Ginger coolly. "Thank you very much. I only wanted to be quiteclear. I think I am beginning to understand."

Up till now the King and Jewel had said nothing: they were waiting until the Ape shouldbid them speak, for they thought it was no use interrupting. But now, as Tirian lookedround on the miserable faces of the Narnians, and saw how they would all believe thatAslan and Tash were one and the same, he could bear it no longer.

"Ape," he cried with a great voice, "you lie damnably. You lie like a Calormene. You lielike an Ape."

He meant to go on and ask how the terrible god Tash who fed on the blood of his peoplecould possibly be the same as the good Lion by whose blood all Narnia was saved. If hehad been allowed to speak, the rule of the Ape might have ended that day; the Beastsmight have seen the truth and thrown the Ape down. But before he could say anotherword two Calormenes struck him in the mouth with all their force, and a third, frombehind, kicked his feet from under him. And as he fell, the Ape squealed in rage andterror.

"Take him away. Take him away. Take him where he cannot hear us, nor we hear him.

There tie him to a tree. I will - I mean, Aslan will - do justice on him later."
