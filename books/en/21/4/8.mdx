title: CHAPTER 8. THE HOUSE OF HARFANG

"Go on, Pole, do your stuff," whispered Scrubb.

Jill found that her mouth was so dry that she couldn't speak a word. She nodded savagelyat Scrubb.

Thinking to himself that he would never forgive her (or Puddleglum either), Scrubblicked his lips and shouted up to the King giant.

"If you please, Sire, the Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes you by us and said you'd like tohave us for your Autumn Feast."

The giant King and Queen looked at each other, nodded to each other, and smiled in away that Jill didn't exactly like. She liked the King better than the Queen. He had a fine,curled beard and a straight eagle-like nose, and was really rather good-looking as giantsgo. The Queen was dreadfully fat and had a double chin and a fat, powdered face - whichisn't a very nice thing at the best of times, and of course looks much worse when it is tentimes too big. Then the King put out his tongue and licked his lips. Anyone might do that:

but his tongue was so very large and red, and came out so unexpectedly, that it gave Jillquite a shock.

"Oh, what good children!" said the Queen. ("Perhaps she's the nice one after all," thoughtJill.)

"Yes indeed," said the King. "Quite excellent children. We welcome you to our court.

Give me your hands."

He stretched down his great right hand - very clean and with any number of rings on thefingers, but also with terrible pointed nails. He was much too big to shake the handswhich the children, in turn, held up to him; but he shook the arms.

"And what's that?" asked the King, pointing to Puddleglum.

"Reshpeckobiggle," said Puddleglum.

"Oh!" screamed the Queen, gathering her skirts close about her ankles. "The horrid thing!

It's alive."

"He's quite all right, your Majesty, really, he is," said Scrubb hastily. "You'll like himmuch better when you get to know him. I'm sure you will."

I hope you won't lose all interest in Jill for the rest of the book if I tell you that at thismoment she began to cry. There was a good deal of excuse for her. Her feet and handsand ears and nose were still only just beginning to thaw; melted snow was trickling offher clothes; she had had hardly anything to eat or drink that day; and her legs were achingso that she felt she could not go on standing much longer. Anyway, it did more good atthe moment than anything else would have done, for the Queen said:

"Ah, the poor child! My lord, we do wrong to keep our guests standing. Quick, some ofyou! Take them away. Give them food and wine and baths. Comfort the little girl. Giveher lollipops, give her dolls, give her physics, give her all you can think of - possets andcomfits and caraways and lullabies and toys. Don't cry, little girl, or you won't be goodfor anything when the feast comes."

Jill was just as indignant as you and I would have been at the mention of toys and dolls;and, though lollipops and comfits might be all very well in their way, she very muchhoped that something more solid would be provided. The Queen's foolish speech,however, produced excellent results, for Puddleglum and Scrubb were at once picked upby gigantic gentlemen-in-waiting, and Jill by a gigantic maid of honour, and carried off totheir rooms.

Jill's room was about the size of a church, and would have been rather grim if it had nothad a roaring fire on the hearth and a very thick crimson carpet on the floor. And heredelightful things began to happen to her. She was handed over to the Queen's old Nurse,

who was, from the giants' point of view, a little old woman almost bent double with age,and, from the human point of view, a giantess small enough to go about an ordinary roomwithout knocking her head on the ceiling. She was very capable, though Jill did wish shewouldn't keep on clicking her tongue and saying things like "Oh la, la! Ups-adaisy" and"There's a duck" and "Now we'll be all right, my poppet". She filled a giant foot-bathwith hot water and helped Jill into it. If you can swim (as Jill could) a giant bath is alovely thing. And giant towels, though a bit rough and coarse, are lovely too, becausethere are acres of them. In fact you don't need to dry at all, you just roll about on them infront of the fire and enjoy yourself. And when that was over, clean, fresh, warmed clotheswere put on Jill: very splendid clothes and a little too big for her, but clearly made forhumans not giantesses. "I suppose if that woman in the green kirtle comes here, they mustbe used to guests of our size," thought Jill.

She soon saw that she was right about this, for a table and chair of the right height for anordinary grown-up human were placed for her, and the knives and forks and spoons werethe proper size too. It was delightful to sit down, feeling warm and clean at last. Her feetwere still bare and it was lovely to tread on the giant carpet. She sank in it well over herankles and it was just the thing for sore feet. The meal - which I suppose we must calldinner, though it was nearer tea time - was cock-a-leekie soup, and hot roast turkey, and asteamed pudding, and roast chestnuts, and as much fruit as you could eat.

The only annoying thing was that the Nurse kept coming in and out, and every time shecame in, she brought a gigantic toy with her - a huge doll, bigger than Jill herself, awooden horse on wheels, about the size of an elephant, a drum that looked like a younggasometer, and a woolly lamb. They were crude, badly made things, painted in verybright colours, and Jill hated the sight of them. She kept on telling the Nurse she didn'twant them, but the Nurse said:

"Tut-tut-tut-tut. You'll want 'em all right when you've had a bit of a rest, I know! Te-he-

he! Beddy bye, now. A precious poppet!"

The bed was not a giant bed but only a big four-poster, like what you might see in an old-

fashioned hotel; and very small it looked in that enormous room. She was very glad totumble into it.

"Is it still snowing, Nurse?" she asked sleepily.

"No. Raining now, ducky!" said the giantess. "Rain'll wash away all the nasty snow.

Precious poppet will be able to go out and play tomorrow!" And she tucked Jill up andsaid good night.

I know nothing so disagreeable as being kissed by a giantess. Jill thought the same, butwas asleep in five minutes.

The rain fell steadily all the evening and all the night, dashing against the windows of thecastle, and Jill never heard it but slept deeply, past supper time and past midnight. And

then came the deadest hour of the night and nothing stirred but mice in the house of thegiants. At that hour there came to Jill a dream. It seemed to her that she awoke in thesame room and saw the fire, sunk low and red, and in the firelight the great woodenhorse. And the horse came of its own will, rolling on its wheels across the carpet, andstood at her head. And now it was no longer a horse, but a lion as big as the horse. Andthen it was not a toy lion, but a real lion, The Real Lion, just as she had seen him on themountain beyond the world's end. And a smell of all sweet-smelling things there arefilled the room. But there was some trouble in Jill's mind, though she could not thinkwhat it was, and the tears streamed down her face and wet the pillow. The Lion told herto repeat the signs, and she found that she had forgotten them all. At that, a great horrorcame over her. And Aslan took her up in his jaws (she could feel his lips and his breathbut not his teeth) and carried her to the window and made her look out. The moon shonebright; and written in great letters across the world or the sky (she did not know which)were the words UNDER ME. After that, the dream faded away, and when she woke, verylate next morning, she did not remember that she had dreamed at all.

She was up and dressed and had finished breakfast in front of the fire when the Nurseopened the door and said: "Here's pretty poppet's little friends come to play with her."

In came Scrubb and the Marsh-wiggle.

"Hullo! Good morning," said Jill. "Isn't this fun? I've slept about fifteen hours, I believe. Ido feel better, don't you?"

"1 do," said Scrubb, "but Puddleglum says he has a headache. Hullo! - your window has awindow seat. If we got up on that, we could see out." And at once they all did so: and atthe first glance Jill said, "Oh, how perfectly dreadful!"

The sun was shining and, except for a few drifts, the snow had been almost completelywashed away by the rain. Down below them, spread out like a map, lay the flat hill-topwhich they had struggled over yesterday afternoon; seen from the castle, it could not bemistaken for anything but the ruins of a gigantic city. It had been flat, as Jill now saw,because it was still, on the whole, paved, though in places the pavement was broken. Thecriss-cross banks were what was left of the walls of huge buildings which might oncehave been giants' palaces and temples. One bit of wall, about five hundred feet high, wasstill standing; it was that which she had thought was a cliff. The things that had lookedlike factory chimneys were enormous pillars, broken off at unequal heights; theirfragments lay at their bases like felled trees of monstrous stone. The ledges which theyhad climbed down on the north side of the hill - and also, no doubt the other ledges whichthey had climbed up on the south side - were the remaining steps of giant stairs. To crownall, in large, dark lettering across the centre of the pavement, ran the words UNDER ME.

The three travellers looked at each other in dismay, and, after a short whistle, Scrubb saidwhat they were all thinking, "The second and third signs muffed." And at that momentJill's dream rushed back into her mind.

"It's my fault," she said in despairing tones. "I - I'd given up repeating the signs everynight. If I'd been thinking about them I could have seen it was the city, even in all thatsnow."

"I'm worse," said Puddleglum. "I did see, or nearly. I thought it looked uncommonly likea ruined city."

"You're the only one who isn't to blame," said Scrubb. "You did try to make us stop."

"Didn't try hard enough, though," said the Marshwiggle. "And I'd no call to be trying. Iought to have done it. As if I couldn't have stopped you two with one hand each!"

"The truth is," said Scrubb, "we were so jolly keen on getting to this place that we weren'tbothering about anything else. At least I know I was. Ever since we met that woman withthe knight who didn't talk, we've been thinking of nothing else. We'd nearly forgottenabout Prince Rilian."

"I shouldn't wonder," said Puddleglum, "if that wasn't exactly what she intended."

"What I don't quite understand," said Jill, "is how we didn't see the lettering? Or could ithave come there since last night. Could he - Aslan - have put it there in the night? I hadsuch a queer dream." And she told them all about it.

"Why, you chump!" said Scrubb. "We did see it. We got into the lettering. Don't you see?

We got into the letter E in ME. That was your sunk lane. We walked along the bottomstroke of the E, due north - turned to our right along the upright - came to another turn tothe right - that's the middle stroke - and then went on to the top left-hand corner, or (ifyou like) the north-eastern corner of the letter, and came back. Like the bally idiots weare." He kicked the window seat savagely, and went on, "So it's no good, Pole. I knowwhat you were thinking because I was thinking the same. You were thinking how nice itwould have been if Aslan hadn't put the instructions on the stones of the ruined city tillafter we'd passed it. And then it would have been his fault, not ours. So likely, isn't it?

No. We must just own up. We've only four signs to go by, and we've muffed the firstthree."

"You mean I have," said Jill. "It's quite true. I've spoiled everything ever since youbrought me here. All the same - I'm frightfully sorry and all that - all the same, what arethe instructions? UNDER ME doesn't seem to make much sense."

"Yes it does, though," said Puddleglum. "It means we've got to look for the Prince underthat city."

"But how can we?" asked Jill.

"That's the question," said Puddleglum, rubbing his big, frog-like hands together. "Howcan we now? No doubt, if we'd had our minds on our job when we were at the Ruinous

City, we'd have been shown how - found a little door, or a cave, or a tunnel, met someoneto help us. Might have been (you never know) Aslan himself. We'd have got down underthose paving-stones somehow or other. Aslan's instructions always work: there are noexceptions. But how to do it now - that's another matter."

"Well, we shall just have to go back, I suppose," said Jill.

"Easy, isn't it?" said Puddleglum. "We might try opening that door to begin with." Andthey all looked at the door and saw that none of them could reach the handle, and thatalmost certainly no one could turn it if they did.

"Do you think they won't let us out if we ask?" said Jill. And nobody said, but everyonethought, "Supposing they don't."

It was not a pleasant idea. Puddleglum was dead against any idea of telling the giantstheir real business and simply asking to be let out; and of course the children couldn't tellwithout his permission, because they had promised. And all three felt pretty sure thatthere would be no chance of escaping from the castle by night. Once they were in theirrooms with the doors shut, they would be prisoners till morning. They might, of course,ask to have their doors left open, but that would rouse suspicions.

"Our only chance," said Scrubb, "is to try to sneak away by daylight. Mightn't there be anhour in the afternoon when most of the giants are asleep? - and if we could steal downinto the kitchen, mightn't there be a back door open?"

"It's hardly what I call a Chance," said the Marshwiggle. "But it's all the chance we'relikely to get." As a matter of fact, Scrubb's plan was not quite so hopeless as you mightthink. If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon isin some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows aremore likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren'tmeaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants orgrown-ups believe this if you're found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o'clockin the morning.)

"We must put them off their guard, though," said Scrubb. "We must pretend we lovebeing here and are longing for this Autumn Feast."

"That's tomorrow night," said Puddleglum. "I heard one of them say so."

"I see," said Jill. "We must pretend to be awfully excited about it, and keep on askingquestions. They think we're absolute infants anyway, which will make it easier."

"Gay," said Puddleglum with a deep sigh. "That's what we've got to be. Gay. As if wehadn't a care in the world. Frolicsome. You two youngsters haven't always got very highspirits, I've noticed. You must watch me, and do as I do. I'll be gay. Like this" - and heassumed a ghastly grin. "And frolicsome" - here he cut a most mournful caper. "You'll

soon get into it, if you keep your eyes on me. They think I'm a funny fellow already, yousee. I dare say you two thought I was a trifle tipsy last night, but I do assure you it was -

well, most of it was - put on. I had an idea it would come in useful, somehow."

The children, when they talked over their adventures afterwards, could never feel surewhether this last statement was quite strictly true; but they were sure that Puddleglumthought it was true when he made it.

"All right. Gay's the word," said Scrubb. "Now, if we could only get someone to openthis door. While we're fooling about and being gay, we've got to find out all we can aboutthis castle."

Luckily, at that very moment the door opened, and the giant Nurse bustled in saying,"Now, my poppets. Like to come and see the King and all the court setting out on thehunting? Such a pretty sight!"

They lost no time in rushing out past her and climbing down the first staircase they cameto. The noise of hounds and horns and giant voices guided them, so that in a few minutesthey reached the courtyard. The giants were all on foot, for there are no giant horses inthat part of the world, and the giants' hunting is done on foot; like beagling in England.

The hounds were also of normal size. When Jill saw that there were no horses she was atfirst dreadfully disappointed, for she felt sure that the great fat Queen would never goafter hounds on foot; and it would never do to have her about the house all day. But thenshe saw the Queen in a kind of litter supported on the shoulders of six young giants. Thesilly old creature was all got up in green and had a horn at her side.

Twenty or thirty giants, including the King, were assembled, ready for the sport, alltalking and laughing fit to deafen you: and down below, nearer Jill's level, there werewagging tails, and barking, and loose, slobbery mouths and noses of dogs thrust into yourhand. Puddleglum was just beginning to strike what he thought a gay and gamesomeattitude (which might have spoiled everything if it had been noticed) when Jill put on hermost attractively childish smile, rushed across to the Queen's litter and shouted up to theQueen.

"Oh, please! You're not going away, are you? You will come back?"

"Yes, my dear," said the Queen. "I'll be back tonight."

"Oh, good. How lovely!" said Jill. "And we may come to the feast tomorrow night,mayn't we? We're so longing for tomorrow night! And we do love being here. And whileyou're out, we may run over the whole castle and see everything, mayn't we? Do sayyes."

The Queen did say yes, but the laughter of all the courtiers nearly drowned her voice.
