title: CHAPTER 16. THE HEALING OF HARMS
---

WHEN Jill woke next morning and found herself in a cave, she thought for one horridmoment that she was back in the Underworld. But when she noticed that she was lying ona bed of heather with a furry mantle over her, and saw a cheery fire crackling (as if newlylit) on a stone hearth and, farther off, morning sunlight coming in through the cave'smouth, she remembered all the happy truth. They had had a delightful supper, allcrowded into that cave, in spite of being so sleepy before it was properly over. She had avague impression of Dwarfs crowding round the fire with frying-pans rather bigger thanthemselves, and the hissing, and delicious smell of sausages, and more, and more, andmore sausages. And not wretched sausages half full of bread and soya bean either, but

real meaty, spicy ones, fat and piping hot and burst and just the tiniest bit burnt. Andgreat mugs of frothy chocolate, and roast potatoes and roast chestnuts, and baked appleswith raisins stuck in where the cores had been, and then ices just to freshen you up afterall the hot things.

Jill sat up and looked around. Puddleglum and Eustace were lying not far away, both fastasleep.

"Hi, you two!" shouted Jill in a loud voice. "Aren't you ever going to get up?"

"Shoo, shoo!" said a sleepy voice somewhere above her. "Time to be settling down. Havea good snooze, do, do. Don't make a to-do. Tu-whoo!"

"Why, I do believe," said Jill, glancing up at a white bundle of fluffy feathers which wasperched on top of a grandfather clock in one corner of the cave, "I do believe it'sGlimfeather!"

"True, true," whirred the Owl, lifting its head out from under its wing and opening oneeye. "I came up with a message for the Prince at about two. The squirrels brought us thegood news. Message for the Prince. He's gone. You're to follow too. Good-day -" and thehead disappeared again.

As there seemed no further hope of getting any information from the Owl, Jill got up andbegan looking round for any chance of a wash and some breakfast. But almost at once alittle Faun came trotting into the cave with a sharp click-clack of his goaty hoofs on thestone floor.

"Ah! You've woken up at last, Daughter of Eve," he said. "Perhaps you'd better wake theSon of Adam. You've got to be off in a few minutes and two Centaurs have very kindlyoffered to let you ride on their backs down to Cair Paravel." He added in a lower voice.

"Of course, you realize it is a most special and unheard-of honour to be allowed to ride aCentaur. I don't know that I ever heard of anyone doing it before. It wouldn't do to keepthem waiting."

"Where's the Prince?" was the first question of Eustace and Puddleglum as soon as theyhad been wakened.

"He's gone down to meet the King, his father, at Cair Paravel," answered the Faun, whosename was Orruns. "His Majesty's ship is expected in harbour any moment. It seems thatthe King met Aslan - I don't know whether it was in a vision or face to face - before hehad sailed far, and Aslan turned him back and told him he would find his long-lost sonawaiting him when he reached Narnia."

Eustace was now up and he and Jill set about helping Orruns to get the breakfast.

Puddleglum was told to stay in bed. A Centaur called Cloudbirth, a famous healer, or (asOrruns called it) a 'leech', was coming to see to his burnt foot.

"Ah!" said Puddleglum in a tone almost of contentment, "he'll want to have the leg off atthe knee, I shouldn't wonder. You see if he doesn't." But he was quite glad to stay in bed.

Breakfast was scrambled eggs and toast and Eustace tackled it just as if he had not had avery large supper in the middle of the night.

"I say, Son of Adam," said the Faun, looking with a certain awe at Eustace's mouthfuls.

"There's no need to hurry quite so dreadfully as that. I don't think the Centaurs have quitefinished their breakfasts yet."

"Then they must have got up very late," said Eustace. "I bet it's after ten o'clock."

"Oh no," said Orruns. "They got up before it was light."

"Then they must have waited the dickens of a time for breakfast," said Eustace.

"No, they didn't," said Orruns. "They began eating the minute they awoke."

"Golly!" said Eustace. "Do they eat a very big breakfast?"

"Why, Son of Adam, don't you understand? A Centaur has a man-stomach and a horse-

stomach. And of course both want breakfast. So first of all he has porridge and pavendersand kidneys and bacon and omelette and cold ham and toast and marmalade and coffeeand beer. And after that he attends to the horse part of himself by grazing for an hour orso and finishing up with a hot mash, some oats, and a bag of sugar. That's why it's such aserious thing to ask a Centaur to stay for the week-end. A very serious thing indeed."

At that moment there was a sound of horse-hoofs tapping on rock from the mouth of thecave, and the children looked up. The two Centaurs, one with a black and one with agolden beard flowing over their magnificent bare chests, stood waiting for them, bendingtheir heads a little so as to look into the cave. Then the children became very polite andfinished their breakfast very quickly. No one thinks a Centaur funny when he sees it.

They are solemn, majestic people, full of ancient wisdom which they learn from the stars,not easily made either merry or angry; but their anger is terrible as a tidal wave when itcomes.

"Good-bye, dear Puddleglum," said Jill, going over to the Marsh-wiggle's bed. "I'm sorrywe called you a wet blanket."

"So'm I," said Eustace. "You've been the best friend in the world."

"And I do hope we'll meet again," added Jill.

"Not much chance of that, I should say," replied Puddleglum. "1 don't reckon I'm verylikely to see my old wigwam again either. And that Prince - he's a nice chap - but do you

think he's very strong? Constitution ruined with living underground, I shouldn't wonder.

Looks the sort that might go off any day."

"Puddleglum!" said Jill. "You're a regular old humbug. You sound as doleful as a funeraland I believe you're perfectly happy. And you talk as if you were afraid of everything,when you're really as brave as-as a lion."

"Now, speaking of funerals," began Puddleglum, but Jill, who heard the Centaurs tappingwith their hoofs behind her, surprised him very much by flinging her arms round his thinneck and kissing his muddy-looking face, while Eustace wrung his hand. Then they bothrushed away to the Centaurs, and the Marsh-wiggle, sinking back on his bed, remarked tohimself, "Well, I wouldn't have dreamt of her doing that. Even though I am a good-

looking chap."

To ride on a Centaur is, no doubt, a great honour (and except Jill and Eustace there isprobably no one alive in the world today who has had it) but it is very uncomfortable. Forno one who valued his life would suggest putting a saddle on a Centaur, and riding bare-

back is no fun; especially if, like Eustace, you have never learned to ride at all. TheCentaurs were very polite in a grave, gracious, grown-up kind of way, and as theycantered through the Narnian woods they spoke, without turning their heads, telling thechildren about the properties of herbs and roots, the influences of the planets, the ninenames of Aslan with their meanings, and things of that sort. But however sore and joltedthe two humans were, they would now give anything to have that journey over again: tosee those glades and slopes sparkling with last night's snow, to be met by rabbits andsquirrels and birds that wished you good morning, to breathe again the air of Narnia andhear the voices of the Narnian trees.

They came down to the river, flowing bright and blue in winter sunshine, far below thelast bridge (which is at the snug, red-roofed little town of Beruna) and were ferried acrossin a flat barge by the ferryman; or rather, by the ferry-wiggle, for it is Marsh-wiggles whodo most of the watery and fishy kinds of work in Narnia. And when they had crossed theyrode along the south bank of the river and presently came to Cair Paravel itself. And atthe very moment of their arrival they saw that same bright ship which they had seen whenthey first set foot in Narnia, gliding up the river like a huge bird. All the court were oncemore assembled on the green between the castle and the quay to welcome King Caspianhome again. Rilian, who had changed his black clothes and was now dressed in a scarletcloak over silver mail, stood close to the water's edge, bare-headed, to receive his father;and the Dwarf Trumpkin sat beside him in his little donkey-chair. The children saw therewould be no chance of reaching the Prince through all that crowd, and, anyway, they nowfelt rather shy. So they asked the Centaurs if they might go on sitting on their backs alittle longer and thus see everything over the heads of the courtiers. And the Centaurs saidthey might.

A flourish of silver trumpets came over the water from the ship's deck: the sailors threw arope; rats (Talking Rats, of course) and Marsh-wiggles made it fast ashore; and the shipwas warped in. Musicians, hidden somewhere in the crowd, began to play solemn,

triumphal music. And soon the King's galleon was alongside and the Rats ran thegangway on board her.

Jill expected to see the old King come down it. But there appeared to be some hitch. ALord with a pale face came ashore and knelt to the Prince and to Trumpkin. The threewere talking with their heads close together for a few minutes, but no one could hearwhat they said. The music played on, but you could feel that everyone was becominguneasy. Then four Knights, carrying something and going very slowly, appeared on deck.

When they started to come down the gangway you could see what they were carrying: itwas the old King on a bed, very pale and still. They set him down. The Prince kneltbeside him and embraced him. They could see King Caspian raising his hand to bless hisson. And everyone cheered, but it was a half-hearted cheer, for they all felt thatsomething was going wrong. Then suddenly the King's head fell back upon his pillows,the musicians stopped and there was a dead silence. The Prince, kneeling by the King'sbed, laid down his head upon it and wept.

There were whisperings and goings to and fro. Then Jill noticed that all who wore hats,bonnets, helmets, or hoods were taking them off - Eustace included. Then she heard arustling and flapping noise up above the castle; when she looked she saw that the greatbanner with the golden Lion on it was being brought down to half-mast. And after that,slowly, mercilessly, with wailing strings and disconsolate blowing of horns, the musicbegan again: this time, a tune to break your heart.

They both slipped off their Centaurs (who took no notice of them).

"I wish I was at home," said Jill.

Eustace nodded, saying nothing, and bit his lip.

"I have come," said a deep voice behind them. They turned and saw the Lion himself, sobright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowycompared with him. And in less time than it takes to breathe Jill forgot about the deadKing of Narnia and remembered only how she had made Eustace fall over the cliff, andhow she had helped to muff nearly all the signs, and about all the snappings andquarrellings. And she wanted to say "I'm sorry" but she could not speak. Then the Liondrew them towards him with his eyes, and bent down and touched their pale faces withhis tongue, and said:

"Think of that no more. I will not always be scolding. You have done the work for whichI sent you into Narnia."

"Please, Aslan," said Jill, "may we go home now?"

"Yes. I have come to bring you Home," said Aslan. Then he opened his mouth wide andblew. But this time they had no sense of flying through the air: instead, it seemed thatthey remained still, and the wild breath of Aslan blew away the ship and the dead King

and the castle and the snow and the winter sky. For all these things floated off into the airlike wreaths of smoke, and suddenly they were standing in a great brightness of mid-

summer sunshine, on smooth turf, among mighty trees, and beside a fair, fresh stream.

Then they saw that they were once more on the Mountain of Aslan, high up above andbeyond the end of that world in which Narnia lies. But the strange thing was that thefuneral music for King Caspian still went on, though no one could tell where it camefrom. They were walking beside the stream and the Lion went before them: and hebecame so beautiful, and the music so despairing, that Jill did not know which of them itwas that filled her eyes with tears.

Then Aslan stopped, and the children looked into the stream. And there, on the goldengravel of the bed of the stream, lay King Caspian, dead, with the water flowing over himlike liquid glass. His long white beard swayed in it like water-weed. And all three stoodand wept. Even the Lion wept: great Lion-tears, each tear more precious than the Earthwould be if it was a single solid diamond. And Jill noticed that Eustace looked neitherlike a child crying, nor like a boy crying and wanting to hide it, but like a grownupcrying. At least, that is the nearest she could get to it; but really, as she said, people don'tseem to have any particular ages on that mountain.

"Son of Adam," said Aslan, "go into that thicket and pluck the thorn that you will findthere, and bring it to me."

Eustace obeyed. The thorn was a foot long and sharp as a rapier.

"Drive it into my paw, Son of Adam," said Aslan, holding up his right fore-paw andspreading out the great pad towards Eustace.

"Must I?" said Eustace.

"Yes," said Aslan.

Then Eustace set his teeth and drove the thorn into the Lion's pad. And there came out agreat drop of blood, redder than all redness that you have ever seen or imagined.

And it splashed into the stream over the dead body of the King. At the same moment thedoleful music stopped. And the dead King began to be changed. His white beard turnedto grey, and from grey to yellow, and got shorter and vanished altogether; and his sunkencheeks grew round and fresh, and the wrinkles were smoothed, and his eyes opened, andhis eyes and lips both laughed, and suddenly he leaped up and stood before them - a veryyoung man, or a boy. (But Jill couldn't say which, because of people having no particularages in Aslan's country. Even in this world, of course, it is the stupidest children who aremost childish and the stupidest grown-ups who are most grownup.) And he rushed toAslan and flung his arms as far as they would go round the huge neck; and he gave Aslanthe strong kisses of a King, and Aslan gave him the wild kisses of a Lion.

At last Caspian turned to the others. He gave a great laugh of astonished joy.

"Why! Eustace!" he said. "Eustace! So you did reach the end of the world after all. Whatabout my second-best sword that you broke on the sea-serpent?"

Eustace made a step towards him with both hands held out, but then drew back with asomewhat startled expression.

"Look here! I say," he stammered. "It's all very well. But aren't you? - I mean didn't you -

?"

"Oh, don't be such an ass," said Caspian.

"But," said Eustace, looking at Aslan. "Hasn't he - er died?"

"Yes," said the Lion in a very quiet voice, almost (Jill thought) as if he were laughing.

"He has died. Most people have, you know. Even I have. There are very few whohaven't."

"Oh," said Caspian. "I see what's bothering you. You think I'm a ghost, or somenonsense. But don't you see? I would be that if I appeared in Narnia now: because I don'tbelong there any more. But one can't be a ghost in one's own country. I might be a ghostif I got into your world. I don't know. But I suppose it isn't yours either, now you're here."

A great hope rose in the children's hearts. But Aslan shook his shaggy head. "No, mydears," he said. "When you meet me here again, you will have come to stay. But not now.

You must go back to your own world for a while."

"Sir," said Caspian, "I've always wanted to have just one glimpse of their world. Is thatwrong?"

"You cannot want wrong things any more, now that you have died, my son," said Aslan.

"And you shall see their world - for five minutes of their time. It will take no longer foryou to set things right there." Then Aslan explained to Caspian what Jill and Eustacewere going back to and all about Experiment House: he seemed to know it quite as wellas they did.

"Daughter," said Aslan to Jill, "pluck a switch off that bush." She did; and as soon as itwas in her hand it turned into a fine new riding crop.

"Now, Sons of Adam, draw your swords," said Aslan. "But use only the flat, for it iscowards and children, not warriors, against whom 1 send you."

"Are you coming with us, Aslan?" said Jill.

"They shall see only my back," said Aslan.

He led them rapidly through the wood, and before they had gone many paces, the wall ofExperiment House appcared before them. Then Aslan roared so that the sun shook in thesky and thirty feet of the wall fell down before them. They looked through the gap, downinto the school shrubbery and on to the roof of the gym, all under the same dull autumnsky which they had seen before their adventures began. Aslan turned to Jill and Eustaceand breathed upon them and touched their foreheads with his tongue. Then he lay downamid the gap he had made in the wall and turned his golden back to England, and hislordly face towards his own lands. At the same moment Jill saw figures whom she knewonly too well running up through the laurels towards them. Most of the gang were thereAdela Pennyfather and Cholmondely Major, Edith Winterblott, `Spotty' Sorrier, bigBannister, and the two loathsome Garrett twins. But suddenly they stopped. Their faceschanged, and all the meanness, conceit, cruelty, and sneakishness almost disappeared inone single expression of terror. For they saw the wall fallen down, and a lion as large as ayoung elephant lying in the gap, and three figures in glittering clothes with weapons intheir hands rushing down upon them. For, with the strength of Aslan in them, Jill pliedher crop on the girls and Caspian and Eustace plied the flats of their swords on the boysso well that in two minutes all the bullies were running like mad, crying out, `Murder!

Fascists! Lions! It isn't fair.' And then the Head (who was, by the way, a woman) camerunning out to see what was happening. And when she saw the lion and the broken walland Caspian and Jill and Eustace (whom she quite failed to recognize) she had hystericsand went back to the house and began ringing up the police with stories about a lionescaped from a circus, and escaped convicts who broke down walls and carried drawnswords. In the midst of all this fuss Jill and Eustace slipped quietly indoors and changedout of their bright clothes into ordinary things, and Caspian went back into his ownworld. And the wall, at Aslan's word, was made whole again. When the police arrivedand found no lion, no broken wall, and no convicts, and the Head behaving like a lunatic,there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things aboutExperiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head'sfriends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector tointerfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn't much good even at that, theygot her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.

Eustace buried his fine clothes secretly one night in the school grounds, but Jill smuggledhers home and wore them at a fancy-dress ball next holidays. And from that day forththings changed for the better at Experiment House, and it became quite a good school.

And Jill and Eustace were always friends.

But far off in Narnia, King Rilian buried his father, Caspian the Navigator, Tenth of thatname, and mourned for him. He himself ruled Narnia well and the land was happy in hisdays, though Puddleglum (whose foot was as good as new in three weeks) often pointedout that bright mornings brought on wet afternoons, and that you couldn't expect goodtimes to last. The opening into the hillside was left open, and often in hot summer daysthe Narnians go in there with ships and lanterns and down to the water and sail to and fro,singing, on the cool, dark underground sea, telling each other stories of the cities that lie

fathoms deep below. If ever you have the luck to go to Narnia yourself, do not forget tohave a look at those caves.
