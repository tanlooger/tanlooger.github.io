title: CHAPTER 11. IN THE DARK CASTLE
---

WHEN the meal (which was pigeon pie, cold ham, salad, and cakes) had been brought,and all had drawn their chairs up to the table and begun, the Knight continued:

"You must understand, friends, that I know nothing of who I was and whence I came intothis Dark World. I remember no time when I was not dwelling, as now, at the court ofthis all but heavenly Queen; but my thought is that she saved me from some evilenchantment and brought me hither of her exceeding bounty. (Honest Frogfoot, your cupis empty. Suffer me to refill it.) And this seems to me the likelier because even now I am

bound by a spell, from which my Lady alone can free me. Every night there comes anhour when my mind is most horribly changed, and, after my mind, my body. For first Ibecome furious and wild and would rush upon my dearest friends to kill them, if I werenot bound. And soon after that, I turn into the likeness of a great serpent, hungry, fierce,and deadly. (Sir, be pleased to take another breast of pigeon, I entreat you.) So they tellme, and they certainly speak truth, for my Lady says the same. I myself know nothing ofit, for when my hour is past I awake forgetful of all that vile fit and in my proper shapeand sound mind - saving that I am somewhat wearied. (Little lady, eat one of these honeycakes, which are brought for me from some barbarous land in the far south of the world.)Now the Queen's majesty knows by her art that I shall be freed from this enchantmentwhen once she has made me king of a land in the Overworld and set its crown upon myhead. The land is already chosen and the very place of our breaking out. Her Earthmenhave worked day and night digging a way beneath it, and have now gone so far and sohigh that they tunnel not a score of feet beneath the very grass on which the Updwellersof that country walk. It will be very soon now that those Uplanders' fate will come uponthem. She herself is at the diggings tonight, and I expect a message to go to her. Then thethin roof of earth which still keeps me from my kingdom will be broken through, andwith her to guide me and a thousand Earthmen at my back, I shall ride forth in arms, fallsuddenly on our enemies, slay their chief men, cast down their strong places, anddoubtless be their crowned king within four and twenty hours."

"It's a bit rough luck on them, isn't it?" said Scrubb.

"Thou art a lad of a wondrous, quick-working wit!" exclaimed the Knight. "For, on myhonour, I had never thought of it so before. I see your meaning." He looked slightly, veryslightly troubled for a moment or two; but his face soon cleared and he broke out, withanother of his loud laughs, "But fie on gravity! Is it not the most comical and ridiculousthing in the world to think of them all going about their business and never dreaming thatunder their peaceful fields and floors, only a fathom down, there is a great army ready tobreak out upon them like a fountain! And they never to have suspected! Why, theythemselves, when once the first smart of their defeat is over, can hardly choose but laughat the thought!"

"I don't think it's funny at all," said Jill. "I think you'll be a wicked tyrant."

"What?" said the Knight, still laughing and patting her head in a quite infuriating fashion.

"Is our little maid a deep politician? But never fear, sweetheart. In ruling that land, I shalldo all by the counsel of my Lady, who will then be my Queen too. Her word shall be mylaw, even as my word will be law to the people we have conquered."

"Where I come from," said Jill, who was disliking him more every minute, "they don'tthink much of men who are bossed about by their wives."

"Shalt think otherwise when thou hast a man of thine own, I warrant you," said theKnight, apparently thinking this very funny. "But with my Lady, it is another matter. I amwell content to live by her word, who has already saved me from a thousand dangers. No

mother has taken pains more tenderly for her child, than the Queen's grace has for me.

Why, look you, amid all her cares and business, she rideth out with me in the Overworldmany a time and oft to accustom my eyes to the sunlight. And then I must go fully armedand with visor down, so that no man may see my face, and I must speak to no one. Forshe has found out by art magical that this would hinder my deliverance from the grievousenchantment I lie under. Is not that a lady worthy of a man's whole worship?"

"Sounds a very nice lady indeed," said Puddleglum in a voice which meant exactly theopposite.

They were thoroughly tired of the Knight's talk before they had finished supper.

Puddleglum was thinking, "I wonder what game that witch is really playing with thisyoung fool." Scrubb was thinking, "He's a great baby, really: tied to that woman's apronstrings; he's a sap." And Jill was thinking, "He's the silliest, most conceited, selfish pigI've met for a long time." But when the meal was over, the Knight's mood had changed.

There was no more laughter about him.

"Friends," he said, "my hour is now very near. I am ashamed that you should see me yet Idread being left alone. They will come in presently and bind me hand and foot to yonderchair. Alas, so it must be: for in my fury, they tell me, I would destroy all that I couldreach."

"I say," said Scrubb, "I'm awfully sorry about your enchantment of course, but what willthose fellows do to us when they come to bind you? They talked of putting us in prison.

And we don't like all those dark places very much. We'd much rather stay here till you're. . . better . . . if we may."

"It is well thought of," said the Knight. "By custom none but the Queen herself remainswith me in my evil hour. Such is her tender care for my honour that she would notwillingly suffer any ears but her own to hear the words I utter in that frenzy. But I couldnot easily persuade my attendant gnomes that you should be left with me. And I think Ihear their soft feet even now upon the stairs. Go through yonder door: it leads into myother apartments. And there, either await my coming when they have unbound me; or, ifyou will, return and sit with me in my ravings."

They followed his directions and passed out of the room by a door which they had not yetseen opened. It brought them, they were pleased to see, not into darkness but into alighted corridor. They tried various doors and found (what they very badly needed) waterfor washing and even a looking glass. "He never offered us a wash before supper," saidJill, drying her face. "Selfish, selfcentred pig."

"Are we going back to watch the enchantment, or shall we stay here?" said Scrubb.

"Stay here, I vote," said Jill. "I'd much rather not see it." But she felt a little inquisitive allthe same.

"No, go back," said Puddleglum. "We may pick up some information, and we need all wecan get. I am sure that Queen is a witch and an enemy. And those Earthmen would knockus on the head as soon as look at us. There's a stronger smell of danger and lies andmagic and treason about this land than I've ever smelled before. We need to keep oureyes and ears open."

They went back down the corridor and gently pushed the door open. "It's all right," saidScrubb, meaning that there were no Earthmen about. Then they all came back into theroom where they had supped.

The main door was now shut, concealing the curtain between which they had firstentered. The Knight was seated in a curious silver chair, to which he was bound by hisankles, his knees, his elbows, his wrists, and his waist. There was sweat on his foreheadand his face was filled with anguish.

"Come in, friends," he said, glancing quickly up. "The fit is not yet upon me. Make nonoise, for I told that prying chamberlain that you were in bed. Now . . . I can feel itcoming. Quick! Listen while I am master of myself. When the fit is upon me, it well maybe that I shall beg and implore you, with entreaties and threatenings, to loosen my bonds.

They say I do. I shall call upon you by all that is most dear and most dreadful. But do notlisten to me. Harden your hearts and stop your ears. For while I am bound you are safe.

But if once I were up and out of this chair, then first would come my fury, and after that"- he shuddered - "the change into a loathsome serpent."

"There's no fear of our loosing you," said Puddleglum. "We've no wish to meet wild men;or serpents either."

"I should think not," said Scrubb and Jill together.

"All the same," added Puddleglum in a whisper. "Don't let's be too sure. Let's be on ourguard. We've muffed everything else, you know. He'll be cunning, I shouldn't wonder,once he gets started. Can we trust one another? Do we all promise that whatever he sayswe don't touch those cords? Whatever he says, mind you?"

"Rather!" said Scrubb.

"There's nothing in the world he can say or do that'll make me change my mind," said Jill.

"Hush! Something's happening," said Puddleglum.

The Knight was moaning. His face was as pale as putty, and he writhed in his bonds. Andwhether because she was sorry for him, or for some other reason, Jill thought that helooked a nicer sort of man than he had looked before.

"Ah," he groaned. "Enchantments, enchantments . . . the heavy, tangled, cold, clammyweb of evil magic. Buried alive. Dragged down under the earth, down into the sooty

blackness . . . how many years is it? . . . Have I lived ten years, or a thousand years, in thepit? Maggotmen all around me. Oh, have mercy. Let me out, let me go back. Let me feelthe wind and see the sky . . . There used to be a little pool. When you looked down into ityou could see all the trees growing upside-down in the water, all green, and below them,deep, very deep, the blue sky."

He had been speaking in a low voice; now he looked up, fixed his eyes upon them, andsaid loud and clear:

"Quick! I am sane now. Every night I am sane. If only I could get out of this enchantedchair, it would last. I should be a man again. But every night they bind me, and so everynight my chance is gone. But you are not enemies. I am not your prisoner. Quick! Cutthese cords."

"Stand fast! Steady," said Puddleglum to the two children.

"I beseech you to hear me," said the Knight, forcing himself to speak calmly. "Have theytold you that if I am released from this chair I shall kill you and become a serpent? I seeby your faces that they have. It is a lie. It is at this hour that I am in my right mind: it isall the rest of the day that I am enchanted. You are not Earthmen nor witches. Whyshould you be on their side? Of your courtesy, cut my bonds."

"Steady! Steady! Steady!" said the three travellers to one another.

"Oh, you have hearts of stone," said the Knight. "Believe me, you look upon a wretchwho has suffered almost more than any mortal can bear. What wrong have I ever doneyou, that you should side with my enemies to keep me in such miseries? And the minutesare slipping past. Now you can save me; when this hour has passed, I shall be witlessagain - the toy and lap-dog, nay, more likely the pawn and tool, of the most devilishsorceress that ever planned the woe of men. And this night, of all nights, when she isaway! You take from me a chance that may never come again."

"This is dreadful. I do wish we'd stayed away till it was over," said Jill.

"Steady!" said Puddleglum.

The prisoner's voice was now rising into a shriek. "Let me go, I say. Give me my sword.

My sword! Once I am free I shall take such revenge on Earthmen that Underland will talkof it for a thousand years!"

"Now the frenzy is beginning," said Scrubb. "I hope those knots are all right."

"Yes," said Puddleglum. "He'd have twice his natural strength if he got free now. And I'mnot clever with my sword. He'd get us both, I shouldn't wonder; and then Pole on her ownwould be left to tackle the snake."

The prisoner was now so straining at his bonds that they cut into his wrists and ankles.

"Beware," he said. "Beware. One night I did break them. But the witch was there thattime. You will not have her to help you tonight. Free me now, and I am your friend. I'myour mortal enemy else."

"Cunning, isn't he?" said Puddleglum.

"Once and for all," said the prisoner, "I adjure you to set me free. By all fears and allloves, by the bright skies of Overland, by the great Lion, by Aslan himself, I charge you -

"

"Oh!" cried the three travellers as though they had been hurt. "It's the sign," saidPuddleglum. "It was the words of the sign," said Scrubb more cautiously. "Oh, what arewe to do?" said Jill.

It was a dreadful question. What had been the use of promising one another that theywould not on any account set the Knight free, if they were now to do so the first time hehappened to call upon a name they really cared about? On the other hand, what had beenthe use of learning the signs if they weren't going to obey them? Yet could Aslan havereally meant them to unbind anyone even a lunatic - who asked it in his name? Could itbe a mere accident? Or how if the Queen of the Underworld knew all about the signs andhad made the Knight learn this name simply in order to entrap them? But then, supposingthis was the real sign? . . . They had muffed three already; they daren't muff the fourth.

"Oh, if only we knew!" said Jill.

"I think we do know," said Puddleglum.

"Do you mean you think everything will come right if we do untie him?" said Scrubb.

"I don't know about that," said Puddleglum. "You see, Aslan didn't tell Pole what wouldhappen. He only told her what to do. That fellow will be the death of us once he's up, Ishouldn't wonder. But that doesn't let us off following the sign."

They all stood looking at one another with bright eyes. It was a sickening moment. "Allright!" said Jill suddenly. "Let's get it over. Good-bye, everyone ...!" They all shookhands. The Knight was screaming by now; there was foam on his cheeks.

"Come on, Scrubb," said Puddleglum. He and Scrubb drew their swords and went over tothe captive.

"In the name of Aslan," they said and began methodically cutting the cords. The instantthe prisoner was free, he crossed the room in a single bound, seized his own sword(which had been taken from him and laid on the table), and drew it.

"You first!" he cried and fell upon the silver chair. That must have been a good sword.

The silver gave way before its edge like string, and in a moment a few twisted fragments,shining on the floor, were all that was left. But as the chair broke, there came from it abright flash, a sound like small thunder, and (for one moment) a loathsome smell.

"Lie there, vile engine of sorcery," he said, "lest your mistress should ever use you foranother victim." Then he turned and surveyed his rescuers; and the something wrong,whatever it was, had vanished from his face.

"What?" he cried, turning to Puddleglum. "Do I see before me a Marsh-wiggle - a real,live, honest, Narnian Marsh-wiggle?"

"Oh, so you have heard of Narnia after all?" said Jill.

"Had I forgotten it when I was under the spell?" asked the Knight. "Well, that and allother bedevilments are now over. You may well believe that I know Narnia, for I amRilian, Prince of Narnia, and Caspian the great King is my father."

"Your Royal Highness," said Puddleglum, sinking on one knee (and the children did thesame), "we have come hither for no other end than to seek you."

"And who are you, my other deliverers?" said the Prince to Scrubb and Jill.

"We were sent by Aslan himself from beyond the world's end to seek your Highness,"said Scrubb. "I am Eustace who sailed with him to the island of Ramandu."

"I owe all three of you a greater debt than I can ever pay," said Prince Rilian. "But myfather? Is he yet alive?"

"He sailed east again before we left Narnia, my lord," said Puddleglum. "But yourHighness must consider that the King is very old. It is ten to one his Majesty must die onthe voyage."

"He is old, you say. How long then have I been in the power of the witch?'

"It is more than ten years since your Highness was lost in the woods at the north side ofNarnia."

"Ten years!" said the Prince, drawing his hand across his face as if to rub away the past.

"Yes, I believe you. For now that I am myself I can remember that enchanted life, thoughwhile I was enchanted I could not remember my true self. And now, fair friends - butwait! I hear their feet (does it not sicken a man, that padding woolly tread! faugh!) on thestairs. Lock the door, boy. Or stay. I have a better thought than that. I will fool theseEarthmen, if Aslan gives me the wit. Take your cue from me."

He walked resolutely to the door and flung it wide open.
