title: CHAPTER 5. PUDDLEGLUM
---

JILL. was asleep. Ever since the owls' parliament began she had been yawning terriblyand now she had dropped off. She was not at all pleased at being waked again, and atfinding herself lying on bare boards in a dusty belfry sort of place, completely dark, andalmost completely full of owls. She was even less pleased when she heard that they hadto set off for somewhere else - and not, apparently, for bed - on the Owl's back.

"Oh, come on, Pole, buck up," said Scrubb's voice. "After all, it is an adventure."

"I'm sick of adventures," said Jill crossly.

She did, however, consent to climb on to Glimfeather's back, and was thoroughly wakedup (for a while) by the unexpected coldness of the air when he flew out with her into thenight. The moon had disappeared and there were no stars. Far behind her she could see asingle lighted window well above the ground; doubtless, in one of the towers of CairParavel. It made her long to be back in that delightful bedroom, snug in bed, watching thefirelight on the walls. She put her hands under her cloak and wrapped it tightly round her.

It was uncanny to hear two voices in the dark air a little distance away; Scrubb and hisowl were talking to one another. "He doesn't sound tired," thought Jill. She did not realizethat he had been on great adventures in that world before and that the Narnian air wasbringing back to him a strength he had won when he sailed the Eastern Seas with KingCaspian.

Jill had to pinch herself to keep awake, for she knew that if she dozed on Glimfeather'sback she would probably fall off. When at last the two owls ended their flight, sheclimbed stiffly off Glimfeather and found herself on flat ground. A chilly wind wasblowing and they appeared to be in a place without trees. "Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!"Glimfeather was calling. "Wake up, Puddleglum. Wake up. It is on the Lion's business."

For a long time there was no reply. Then, a long way off, a dim light appeared and beganto come nearer. With it came a voice.

"Owls ahoy!" it said. "What is it? Is the King dead? Has an enemy landed in Narnia? Is ita flood? Or dragons?"

When the light reached them, it turned out to be that of a large lantern. She could see verylittle of the person who held it. He seemed to be all legs and arms. The owls were talkingto him, explaining everything, but she was too tired to listen. She tried to wake herself upa bit when she realized that they were saying goodbye to her. But she could neverafterwards remember much except that, sooner or later, she and Scrubb were stooping toenter a low doorway and then (oh, thank heavens) were lying down on something softand warm, and a voice was saying:

"There you are. Best we can do. You'll lie cold and hard. Damp too, I shouldn't wonder.

Won't sleep a wink, most likely; even if there isn't a thunderstorm or a flood or thewigwam doesn't fall down on top of us all, as I've known them do. Must make the best ofit -" But she was fast asleep before the voice had ended.

When the children woke late next morning they found that they were lying, very dry andwarm, on beds of straw in a dark place. A triangular opening let in the daylight.

"Where on earth are we?" asked Jill.

"In the wigwam of a Marsh-wiggle," said Eustace.

"A what?"

"A Marsh-wiggle. Don't ask me what it is. I couldn't see it last night. I'm getting up. Let'sgo and look for it."

"How beastly one feels after sleeping in one's clothes," said Jill, sitting up.

"I was just thinking how nice it was not to have to dress," said Eustace.

"Or wash either, I suppose," said Jill scornfully. But Scrubb had already got up, yawned,shaken himself, and crawled out of the wigwam. Jill did the same.

What they found outside was quite unlike the bit of Narnia they had seen on the daybefore. They were on a great flat plain which was cut into countless little islands bycountless channels of water. The islands were covered with coarse grass and borderedwith reeds and rushes. Sometimes there were beds of rushes about an acre in extent.

Clouds of birds were constantly alighting in them and rising from them again-duck,snipe, bitterns, herons. Many wigwams like that in which they had passed the night couldbe seen dotted about, but all at a good distance from one another; for Marsh-wiggles arepeople who like privacy. Except for the fringe of the forest several miles to the south andwest of them, there was not a tree in sight. Eastward the flat marsh stretched to low sand-

hills on the horizon, and you could tell by the salt tang in the wind which blew from thatdirection that the sea lay over there. To the North there were low pale-coloured hills, inplaces bastioned with rock. The rest was all flat marsh. It would have been a depressingplace on a w et evening. Seen under a morning sun, with a fresh wind blowing, and theair filled with the crying of birds, there was something fine and fresh and clean about itsloneliness. The children felt their spirits rise.

"Where has the thingummy got to, I wonder?" said Jill.

"The Marsh-wiggle," said Scrubb, as if he were rather proud of knowing the word. "Iexpect-hullo, that must be him." And then they both saw him, sitting with his back tothem, fishing, about fifty yards away. He had been hard to see at first because he wasnearly the same colour as the marsh and because he sat so still.

"I suppose we'd better go and speak to him," said Jill. Scrubb nodded. They both felt alittle nervous.

As they drew nearer, the figure turned its head and showed them a long thin face withrather sunken cheeks, a tightly shut mouth, a sharp nose, and no beard. He was wearing ahigh, pointed hat like a steeple, with an enormously wide flat brim. The hair, if it couldbe called hair, which hung over his large ears was greeny-grey, and each lock was flatrather than round, so that they were like tiny reeds. His expression was solemn, hiscomplexion muddy, and you could see at once that he took a serious view of life.

"Good morning, Guests," he said. "Though when I say good I don't mean it won'tprobably turn to rain or it might he snow, or fog, or thunder. You didn't get any sleep, Idare say.

"Yes we did, though," said Jill. "We had a lovely night."

"Ah," said the Marsh-wiggle, shaking his head. "I see you're making the best of a bad job.

That's right. You've been well brought up, you have. You've learned to put a good face onthings."

"Please, we don't know your name," said Scrubb.

"Puddleglum's my name. But it doesn't matter if you forget it. I can always tell youagain."

The children sat down on each side of him. They now saw that he had very long legs andarms, so that although his body was not much bigger than a dwarf's, he would be tallerthan most men when he stood up. The fingers of his hands were webbed like a frog's, andso were his bare feet which dangled in the muddy water. He was dressed in earthcolouredclothes that hung loose about him.

"I'm trying to catch a few eels to make an eel stew for our dinner," said Puddleglum.

"Though I shouldn't wonder if I didn't get any. And you won't like them much if I do."

"Why not?" asked Scrubb.

"Why, it's not in reason that you should like our sort of victuals, though I've no doubtyou'll put a bold face on it. All the same, while I am a catching of them, if you two couldtry to light the fire - no harm trying -! The wood's behind the wigwam. It may be wet.

You could light it inside the wigwam, and then we'd get all the smoke in our eyes. Or youcould light it outside, and then the rain would come and put it out. Here's my tinder-box.

You won't know how to use it, I expect."

But Scrubb had learned that sort of thing on his last adventure. The children ran backtogether to the wigwam, found the wood (which was perfectly dry) and succeeded inlighting a fire with rather less than the usual difficulty. Then Scrubb sat and took care ofit while Jill went and had some sort of wash - not a very nice one - in the nearest channel.

After that she saw to the fire and he had a wash. Both felt a good deal fresher, but veryhungry.

Presently the Marsh-wiggle joined them. In spite of his expectation of catching no eels,he had a dozen or so, which he had already skinned and cleaned. He put a big pot on,mended the fire, and lit his pipe. Marsh-wiggles smoke a very strange, heavy sort oftobacco (some people say they mix it with mud) and the children noticed the smoke fromPuddleglum's pipe hardly rose in the air at all. It trickled out of the bowl and downwardsand drifted along the ground like a mist. It was very black and set Scrubb coughing.

"Now," said Puddleglum. "Those eels will take a mortal long time to cook, and either ofyou might faint with hunger before they're done. I knew a little girl - but I'd better not tell

you that story. It might lower your spirits, and that's a thing I never do. So, to keep yourminds off your hunger, we may as well talk about our plans."

"Yes, do let's," said Jill. "Can you help us to find Prince Rilian?"

The Marsh-wiggle sucked in his cheeks till they were hollower than you would havethought possible. "Well, I don't know that you'd call it help," he said. "I don't know thatanyone can exactly help. It stands to reason we're not likely to get very far on a journey tothe North, not at this time of the year, with the winter coming on soon and all. And anearly winter too, by the look of things. But you mustn't let that make you down-hearted.

Very likely, what with enemies, and mountains, and rivers to cross, and losing our way,and next to nothing to eat, and sore feet, we'll hardly notice the weather. And if we don'tget far enough to do any good, we may get far enough not to get back in a hurry."

Both children noticed that he said "we", not "you", and both exclaimed at the samemoment. "Are you coming with us?"

"Oh yes, I'm coming of course. Might as well, you see. I don't suppose we shall ever seethe King back in Narnia, now that he's once set off for foreign parts; and he had a nastycough when he left. Then there's Trumpkin. He's failing fast. And you'll find there'll havebeen a bad harvest after this terrible dry summer. And I shouldn't wonder if some enemyattacked us. Mark my words."

"And how shall we start?" said Scrubb.

"Well," said the Marsh-wiggle very slowly, "all the others who ever went looking forPrince Rilian started from that same fountain where the Lord Drinian saw the lady. Theywent north, mostly. And as none of them ever came back, we can't exactly say how theygot on."

"We've got to start by finding a ruined city of giants," said Jill. "Aslan said so."

"Got to start by finding it, have we?" answered Puddleglum. "Not allowed to start bylooking for it, I suppose?"

"That's what I meant, of course," said Jill. "And then, when we've found it-"

"Yes, when!" said Puddleglum very drily.

"Doesn't anyone know where it is?" asked Scrubb.

"I don't know about Anyone," said Puddleglum. "And I won't say I haven't heard of thatRuined City. You wouldn't start from the fountain, though. You'd have to go acrossEttinsmoor. That's where the Ruined City is, if it's anywhere. But I've been as far in thatdirection as most people and I never got to any ruins, so I won't deceive you."

"Where's Ettinsmoor?" said Scrubb.

"Look over there northward," said Puddleglum, pointing with his pipe. "See those hillsand bits of cliff? That's the beginning of Ettinsmoor. But there's a river between it and us;the river Shribble. No bridges, of course."

"I suppose we can ford it, though," said Scrubb.

"Well, it has been forded," admitted the Marsh-wiggle.

"Perhaps we shall meet people on Ettinsmoor who can tell us the way," said Jill.

"You're right about meeting people," said Puddleglum.

"What sort of people live there?" she asked.

"It's not for me to say they aren't all right in their own way," answered Puddleglum. "Ifyou like their way."

"Yes, but what are they?" pressed Jill. "There are so many queer creatures in this country.

I mean, are they animals, or birds, or dwarfs, or what?"

The Marsh-wiggle gave a long whistle. "Phew!" he said. "Don't you know? I thought theowls had told you. They're giants."

Jill winced. She had never liked giants even in books, and she had once met one in anightmare. Then she saw Scrubb's face, which had turned rather green, and thought toherself, "I bet he's in a worse funk than I am." That made her feel braver.

"The King told me long ago," said Scrubb - "that time when I was with him at sea-thathe'd jolly well beaten those giants in war and made them pay him tribute."

"That's true enough," said Puddleglum. "They're at peace with us all right. As long as westay on our own side of the Shribble, they won't do us any harm. Over on their side, onthe Moor - Still, there's always a chance. If we don't get near any of them, and if none ofthem forget themselves, and if we're not seen, it's just possible we might get a long way."

"Look here!" said Scrubb, suddenly losing his temper, as people so easily do when theyhave been frightened. "I don't believe the whole thing can be half as bad as you're makingout; any more than the beds in the wigwam were hard or the wood was wet. I don't thinkAslan would ever have sent us if there was so little chance as all that."

He quite expected the Marsh-wiggle to give him an angry reply, but he only said, "That'sthe spirit, Scrubb. That's the way to talk. Put a good face on it. But we all need to be verycareful about our tempers, seeing all the hard times we shall have to go through together.

Won't do to quarrel, you know. At any rate, don't begin it too soon. I know these

expeditions usually end that way: knifing one another, I shouldn't wonder, before all'sdone. But the longer we can keep off it-"

"Well, if you feel it's so hopeless," interrupted Scrubb, "I think you'd better stay behind.

Pole and I can go on alone, can't we, Pole?"

"Shut up and don't be an ass, Scrubb," said Jill hastily, terrified lest the Marsh-wiggleshould take him at his word.

"Don't you lose heart, Pole," said Puddleglum. "I'm coming, sure and certain. I'm notgoing to lose an opportunity like this. It will do me good. They all say - I mean, the otherwiggles all say-that I'm too flighty; don't take life seriously enough. If they've said itonce, they've said it a thousand times. 'Puddleglum,' they've said, `you're altogether toofull of bobance and bounce and high spirits. You've got to learn that life isn't allfricasseed frogs and eel pie. You want something to sober you down a bit. We're onlysaying it for your own good, Puddleglum.' That's what they say. Now a job like this - ajourney up north just as winter's beginning, looking for a Prince that probably isn't there,by way of a ruined city that no one has ever seen - will be just the thing. If that doesn'tsteady a chap, I don't know what will." And he rubbed his big frog-like hands together asif he were talking of going to a party or a pantomime. "And now," he added, "let's seehow those eels are getting on."

When the meal came it was delicious and the children had two large helpings each. Atfirst the Marsh-wiggle wouldn't believe that they really liked it, and when they had eatenso much that he had to believe them, he fell back on saying that it would probablydisagree with them horribly. "What's food for wiggles may be poison for humans, Ishouldn't wonder," he said. After the meal they had tea, in tins (as you've seen menhaving it who are working on the road), and Puddleglum had a good many sips out of asquare black bottle. He offered the children some of it, but they thought it very nasty.

The rest of the day was spent in preparations for an early start tomorrow morning.

Puddleglum, being far the biggest, said he would carry three blankets, with a large bit ofbacon rolled up inside them. Jill was to carry the remains of the eels, some biscuit, andthe tinder-box. Scrubb was to carry both his own cloak and Jill's when they didn't want towear them. Scrubb (who had learned some shooting when he sailed to the East underCaspian) had Puddleglum's secondbest bow, and Puddleglum had his best one; though hesaid that what with winds, and damp bowstrings, and bad light, and cold fingers, it was ahundred to one against either of them hitting anything. He and Scrubb both had swordsScrubb had brought the one which had been left out for him in his room at Cair Paravel,but Jill had to be content with her knife. There would have been a quarrel about this, butas soon as they started sparring the wiggle rubbed his hands and said, "Ah, there you are.

I thought as much. That's what usually happens on adventures." This made them bothshut up.

All three went to bed early in the wigwam. This time the children really had a rather badnight. That was because Puddleglum, after saying, "You'd better try for some sleep, you

two; not that I suppose any of us will close an eye tonight," instantly went off into such aloud, continuous snore that, when Jill at last got to sleep, she dreamed all night aboutroad-drills and waterfalls and being in express trains in tunnels.
