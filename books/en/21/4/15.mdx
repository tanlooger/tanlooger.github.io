title: CHAPTER 15. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JILL
---

THE patch of light did not show up anything down in the darkness where they werestanding. The others could only hear, not see, Jill's efforts to get on to the Marsh-wiggle'sback. That is, they heard him saying, "You needn't put your finger in my eye," and, "Noryour foot in my mouth either," and, "That's more like it," and, "Now, I'll hold on to yourlegs. That'll leave your arms free to steady yourself against the earth."

Then they looked up and soon they saw the black shape of Jill's head against the patch oflight.

"Well?" they all shouted up anxiously.

"It's a hole," called Jill's voice. "I could get through it if I was a little bit higher."

"What do you see through it?" asked Eustace.

"Nothing much yet," said Jill. "I say, Puddleglum, let go my legs so that I can stand onyour shoulders instead of sitting on them. I can steady myself all right against the edge."

They could hear her moving and then much more of her came into sight against thegreyness of the opening; in fact all of her down to the waist.

"I say -" began Jill, but suddenly broke off with a cry: not a sharp cry. It sounded more asif her mouth had been muffled up or had something pushed into it. After that she foundher voice and seemed to be shouting out as loud as she could, but they couldn't hear thewords. Two things then happened at the same moment. The patch of light was completelyblocked up for a second or so; and they heard both a scuffling, struggling sound and thevoice of the Marsh-wiggle gasping: "Quick! Help! Hold on to her legs.

Someone's pulling her. There! No, here. Too late!"

The opening, and the cold light which filled it, were now perfectly clear again. Jill hadvanished.

"Jill! Jill!" they shouted frantically, but there was no answer.

"Why the dickens couldn't you have held her feet?" said Eustace.

"I don't know, Scrubb," groaned Puddleglum. "Born to be a misfit, I shouldn't wonder.

Fated. Fated to be Pole's death, just as I was fated to eat Talking Stag at Harfang. Not thatit isn't my own fault as well, of course."

"This is the greatest shame and sorrow that could have fallen on us," said the Prince. "Wehave sent a brave lady into the hands of enemies and stayed behind in safety."

"Don't paint it too black, Sir," said Puddleglum. "We're not very safe except for death bystarvation in this hole."

"I wonder am I small enough to get through where Jill did?" said Eustace.

What had really happened to Jill was this. As soon as she got her head out of the hole shefound that she was looking down as if from an upstairs window, not up as if through atrap-door. She had been so long in the dark that her eyes couldn't at first take in what theywere seeing: except that she was not looking at the daylit, sunny world which she sowanted to see. The air seemed to be deadly cold, and the light was pale and blue. Therewas also a good deal of noise going on and a lot of white objects flying about in the air. Itwas at that moment that she had shouted down to Puddleglum to let her stand up on hisshoulders.

When she had done this, she could see and hear a good deal better. The noises she hadbeen hearing turned out to be of two kinds: the rhythmical thump of several feet, and themusic of four fiddles, three flutes, and a drum. She also got her own position clear. Shewas looking out of a hole in a steep bank which sloped down and reached the level aboutfourteen feet below her. Everything was very white. A lot of people were moving about.

Then she gasped! The people were trim little Fauns, and Dryads with leafcrowned hairfloating behind them. For a second they looked as if they were moving anyhow; then shesaw that they were really doing a dance - a dance with so many complicated steps andfigures that it took you some time to understand it. Then it came over her like athunderclap that the pale, blue light was really moonlight, and the white stuff on theground was really snow. And of course! There were the stars staring in a black frosty skyoverhead. And the tall black things behind the dancers were trees. They had not only gotout into the upper world at last, but had come out in the heart of Narnia. Jill felt she couldhave fainted with delight; and the music - the wild music, intensely sweet and yet just theleast bit eerie too, and full of good magic as the Witch's thrumming had been full of badmagic - made her feel it all the more.

All this takes a long time to tell, but of course it took a very short time to see. Jill turnedalmost at once to shout down to the others, "I say! It's all right. We're out, and we'rehome." But the reason she never got further than "I say" was this. Circling round andround the dancers was a ring of Dwarfs, all dressed in their finest clothes; mostly scarletwith fur-lined hoods and golden tassels and big furry top-boots. As they circled roundthey were all diligently throwing snowballs. (Those were the white things that Jill had

seen flying through the air.) They weren't throwing them at the dancers as silly boysmight have been doing in England. They were throwing them through the dance in suchperfect time with the music and with such perfect aim that if all the dancers were inexactly the right places at exactly the right moments, no one would be hit. This is calledthe Great Snow Dance and it is done every year in Narnia on the first moonlit night whenthere is snow on the ground. Of course it is a kind of game as well as a dance, becauseevery now and then some dancer will be the least little bit wrong and get a snowball inthe face, and then everyone laughs. But a good team of dancers, Dwarfs, and musicianswill keep it up for hours without a single hit. On fine nights when the cold and the drum-

taps, and the hooting of the owls, and the moonlight, have got into their wild, woodlandblood and made it even wilder, they will dance till daybreak. I wish you could see it foryourselves.

What had stopped Jill when she got as far as the say of "I say" was of course simply afine big snowball that came sailing through the dance from a Dwarf on the far side andgot her fair and square in the mouth. She didn't in the least mind; twenty snowballs wouldnot have damped her spirits at that moment. But however happy you are feeling, you can'ttalk with your mouth full of snow. And when, after considerable spluttering, she couldspeak again, she quite forgot in her excitement that the others, down in the dark, behindher, still didn't know the good news. She simply leaned as far out of the hole as she could,and yelled to the dancers.

"Help! Help! We're buried in the hill. Come and dig us out."

The Narnians, who had not even noticed the little hole in the hillside, were of course verysurprised, and looked about in several wrong directions before they found out where thevoice was coming from. But when they caught sight of Jill they all came running towardsher, and as many as could scrambled up the bank, and a dozen or more hands werestretched up to help her. And Jill caught hold of them and thus got out of the hole andcame slithering down the bank head first, and then picked herself up and said:

"Oh, do go and dig the others out. There are three others, besides the horses. And one ofthem is Prince Rilian."

She was already in the middle of a crowd when she said this, for besides the dancers allsorts of people who had been watching the dance, and whom she had not seen at first,came running up. Squirrels came out of the trees in showers, and so did Owls. Hedgehogscame waddling as fast as their short legs would carry them. Bears and Badgers followedat a slower pace. A great Panther, twitching its tail in excitement, was the last to join theparty.

But as soon as they understood what Jill was saying, they all became active. "Pick andshovel, boys, pick and shovel. Off for our tools!" said the Dwarfs, and dashed away intothe woods at top speed. "Wake up some Moles, they're the chaps for digging. They'requite as good as Dwarfs," said a voice. "What was that she said about Prince Rilian?" saidanother. "Hush!" said the Panther. "The poor child's crazed, and no wonder after being

lost inside the hill. She doesn't know what she's saying." "That's right," said an old Bear.

"Why, she said Prince Rilian was a horse!" "No, she didn't," said a Squirrel, very pert.

"Yes, she did," said another Squirrel, even perter.

"It's quite t-t-t-true. D-d-don't be so silly," said Jill. She spoke like that because her teethwere now chattering with the cold.

Immediately one of the Dryads flung round her a furry cloak which some Dwarf haddropped when he rushed to fetch his mining tools, and an obliging Faun trotted off amongthe trees to a place where Jill could see firelight in the mouth of a cave, to get her a hotdrink. But before it came, all the Dwarfs reappeared with spades and pick-axes andcharged at the hillside. Then Jill heard cries of "Hi! What are you doing? Put that sworddown," and "Now, young 'un: none of that," and, "He's a vicious one, now, isn't he?" Jillhurried to the spot and didn't know whether to laugh or cry when she saw Eustace's face,very pale and dirty, projecting from the blackness of the hole, and Eustace's right handbrandishing a sword with which he made lunges at anyone who came near him.

For of course Eustace had been having a very different time from Jill during the last fewminutes. He had heard Jill cry out and seen her disappear into the unknown. Like thePrince and Puddleglum, he thought that some enemies had caught her. And from downbelow he didn't see that the pale, blueish light was moonlight. He thought the hole wouldlead only into some other cave, lit by some ghostly phosphorescence and filled withgoodness-knows-what evil creatures of the Underworld. So that when he had persuadedPuddleglum to give him a back, and drawn his sword, and poked out his head, he hadreally been doing a very brave thing. The others would have done it first if they could,but the hole was too small for them to climb through. Eustace was a little bigger, and a lotclumsier, than Jill, so that when he looked out he bumped his head against the top of thehole and brought a small avalanche of snow down on his face. And so, when he could seeagain, and saw dozens of figures coming at him as hard as they could run, it is notsurprising that he tried to ward them off.

"Stop, Eustace, stop," cried Jill. "They're all friends. Can't you see? We've come up inNarnia. Everything's all right."

Then Eustace did see, and apologized to the Dwarfs (and the Dwarfs said not to mentionit), and dozens of thick, hairy, dwarfish hands helped him out just as they had helped Jillout a few minutes before. Then Jill scrambled up the bank and put her head in at the darkopening and shouted the good news in to the prisoners. As she turned away she heardPuddleglum mutter. "Ah, poor Pole. It's been too much for her, this last bit. Turned herhead, I shouldn't wonder. She's beginning to see things."

Jill rejoined Eustace and they shook one another by both hands and took in great deepbreaths of the free midnight air. And a warm cloak was brought for Eustace and hotdrinks, for both. While they were sipping it, the Dwarfs had already got all the snow andall the sods off a large strip of the hillside round the original hole, and the pickaxes andspades were now going as merrily as the feet of Fauns and Dryads had been going in the

dance ten minutes before. Only ten minutes! Yet already it felt to Jill and Eustace as if alltheir dangers in the dark and heat and general smotheriness of the earth must have beenonly a dream. Out here, in the cold, with the moon and the huge stars overhead (Narnianstars are nearer than stars in our world) and with kind, merry faces all round them, onecouldn't quite believe in Underland.

Before they had finished their hot drinks, a dozen or so Moles, newly waked and stillvery sleepy, and not well pleased, had arrived. But as soon as they understood what itwas all about, they joined in with a will. Even the Fauns made themselves useful bycarting away the earth in little barrows, and the Squirrels danced and leaped to and fro ingreat excitement, though Jill never found out exactly what they thought they were doing.

The Bears and Owls contented themselves with giving advice, and kept on asking thechildren if they wouldn't like to come into the cave (that was where Jill had seen thefirelight) and get warm and have supper. But the children couldn't bear to go withoutseeing their friends set free.

No one in our world can work at a job of that sort as Dwarfs and Talking Moles work inNarnia; but then, of course, Moles and Dwarfs don't look on it as work. They likedigging. It was therefore not really long before they had opened a great black chasm inthe hillside. And out from the blackness into the moonlight - this would have been ratherdreadful if one hadn't known who they were came, first, the long, leggy, steeple-hattedfigure of the Marsh-wiggle, and then, leading two great horses, Rilian the Prince himself.

As Puddleglum appeared shouts broke out on every side: "Why, it's a Wiggle - why, it'sold Puddleglum - old Puddleglum from the Eastern Marshes - what ever have you beendoing, Puddleglum? - there've been search-parties out for you - the Lord Trumpkin hasbeen putting up notices there's a reward offered!" But all this died away, all in onemoment, into dead silence, as quickly as the noise dies away in a rowdy dormitory if theHeadmaster opens the door. For now they saw the Prince.

No one doubted for a moment who he was. There were plenty of Beasts and Dryads andDwarfs and Fauns who remembered him from the days before his enchanting. There weresome old ones who could just remember how his father, King Caspian, had looked whenhe was a young man, and saw the likeness. But I think they would have known himanyway. Pale though he was from long imprisonment in the Deep Lands, dressed inblack, dusty, dishevelled, and weary, there was something in his face and air which noone could mistake. That look is in the face of all true kings of Narnia, who rule by thewill of Aslan and sit at Cair Paravel on the throne of Peter the High King.

Instantly every head was bared and every knee was bent; a moment later such cheeringand shouting, such jumps and reels of joy, such hand-shakings and kissings andembracings of everybody by everybody else broke out that the tears came into Jill's eyes.

Their quest had been worth all the pains it cost.

"Please it your Highness," said the oldest of the Dwarfs, "there is some attempt at asupper in the cave yonder, prepared against the ending of the snow-dance -"

"With a good will, Father," said the Prince. "For never had any Prince, Knight,Gentleman, or Bear so good a stomach to his victuals as we four wanderers have tonight."

The whole crowd began to move away through the trees towards the cave. Jill heardPuddleglum saying to those who pressed round him. "No, no, my story can wait.

Nothing worth talking about has happened to me. I want to hear the news. Don't trybreaking it to me gently, for I'd rather have it all at once. Has the King beenshipwrecked? Any forest fires? No wars on the Calormen border? Or a few dragons, Ishouldn't wonder?" And all the creatures laughed aloud and said, "Isn't that just like aMarshwiggle?"

The two children were nearly dropping with tiredness and hunger, but the warmth of thecave, and the very sight of it, with the firelight dancing on the walls and dressers andcups and saucers and plates and on the smooth stone floor, just as it does in a farmhousekitchen, revived them a little. All the same they went fast asleep while supper was beinggot ready. And while they slept Prince Rilian was talking over the whole adventure withthe older and wiser Beasts and Dwarfs. And now they all saw what it meant; how awicked Witch (doubtless the same kind as that White Witch who had brought the GreatWinter on Narnia long ago) had contrived the whole thing, first killing Rilian's motherand enchanting Rilian himself. And they saw how she had dug right under Narnia andwas going to break out and rule it through Rilian: and how he had never dreamed that thecountry of which she would make him king (king in name, but really her slave) was hisown country. And from the children's part of the story they saw how she was in leagueand friendship with the dangerous giants of Harfang. "And the lesson of it all is, yourHighness," said the oldest Dwarf, "that those Northern Witches always mean the samething, but in every age they have a different plan for getting it."
