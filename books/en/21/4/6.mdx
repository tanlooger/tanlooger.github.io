title: CHAPTER 6. THE WILD WASTE LANDS OF THE NORTH
---

AT about nine o'clock next morning three lonely figures might have been seen pickingtheir way across the Shribble by the shoals and stepping-stones. It was a shallow, noisystream, and even Jill was not wet above her knees when they reached the northern bank.

About fifty yards ahead, the land rose up to the beginning of the moor, everywheresteeply, and often in cliffs.

"I suppose that's our way!" said Scrubb, pointing left and west to where a stream floweddown from the moor through a shallow gorge. But the Marsh-wiggle shook his head.

"The giants mainly live along the side of that gorge," he said. "You might say the gorgewas like a street to them. We'll do better straight ahead, even though it's a bit steep."

They found a place where they could scramble up, and in about ten minutes stood pantingat the top. They cast a longing look back at the valley-land of Narnia and then turnedtheir faces to the North. The vast, lonely moor stretched on and up as far as they couldsee. On their left was rockier ground. Jill thought that must be the edge of the giants'gorge and did not much care about looking in that direction. They set out.

It was good, springy ground for walking, and a day of pale winter sunlight. As they gotdeeper into the moor, the loneliness increased: one could hear peewits and see anoccasional hawk. When they halted in the middle of the morning for a rest and a drink ina little hollow by a stream, Jill was beginning to feel that she might enjoy adventuresafter all, and said so.

"We haven't had any yet," said the Marsh-wiggle.

Walks after the first halt - like school mornings after break or railway journeys afterchanging trains - never go on as they were before. When they set out again, Jill noticedthat the rocky edge of the gorge had drawn nearer. And the rocks were less flat, moreupright, than they had been. In fact they were like little towers of rock. And what funnyshapes they were!

"I do believe," thought Jill, "that all the stories about giants might have come from thosefunny rocks. If you were coming along here when it was half dark, you could easily thinkthose piles of rock were giants. Look at that one, now! You could almost imagine that thelump on top was a head. It would be rather too big for the body, but it would do wellenough for an ugly giant. And all that bushy stuff - I suppose it's heather and birds' nests,really - would do quite well for hair and beard. And the things sticking out on each sideare quite like ears. They'd be horribly big, but then I dare say giants would have big ears,like elephants. And - o-o-o-h! -"

Her blood froze. The thing moved. It was a real giant. There was no mistaking it; she hadseen it turn its head. She had caught a glimpse of the great, stupid, puffcheeked face. Allthe things were giants, not rocks. There were forty or fifty of them, all in a row;obviously standing with their feet on the bottom of the gorge and their elbows resting onthe edge of the gorge, just as men might stand leaning on a wall - lazy men, on a finemorning after breakfast.

"Keep straight on," whispered Puddleglum, who had noticed them too. "Don't look atthem. And whatever you do, don't run. They'd be after us in a moment."

So they kept on, pretending not to have seen the giants. It was like walking past the gateof a house where there is a fierce dog, only far worse. There were dozens and dozens ofthese giants. They didn't look angry - or kind or interested at all. There was no sign thatthey had seen the travellers.

Then - whizz-whizz-whizz - some heavy object came hurtling through the air, and with acrash a big boulder fell about twenty paces ahead of them. And then - thud! - another felltwenty feet behind.

"Are they aiming at us?" asked Scrubb.

"No," said Puddleglum. "We'd be a good deal safer if they were. They're trying to hit that- that cairn over there to the right. They won't hit it, you know. It's safe enough; they'resuch very bad shots. They play cock-shies most fine mornings. About the only gamethey're clever enough to understand."

It was a horrible time. There seemed no end to the line of giants, and they never ceasedhurling stones, some of which fell extremely close. Quite apart from the real danger, thevery sight and sound of their faces and voices were enough to scare anyone. Jill tried notto look at them.

After about twenty-five minutes the giants apparently had a quarrel. This put an end tothe cock-shies, but it is not pleasant to be within a mile of quarrelling giants. Theystormed and jeered at one another in long, meaningless words of about twenty syllableseach. They foamed and gibbered and jumped in their rage, and each jump shook the earthlike a bomb. They lammed each other on the head with great, clumsy stone hammers; buttheir skulls were so hard that the hammers bounced off again, and then the monster who

had given the blow would drop his hammer and howl with pain because it had stung hisfingers. But he was so stupid that he would do exactly the same thing a minute later. Thiswas a good thing in the long run, for by the end of an hour all the giants were so hurt thatthey sat down and began to cry. When they sat down, their heads were below the edge ofthe gorge, so that you saw them no more; but Jill could hear them howling andblubbering and boo-booing like great babies even after the place was a mile behind.

That night they bivouacked on the bare moor, and Puddleglum showed the children howto make the best of their blankets by sleeping back to back. (The backs keep each otherwarm and you can then have both blankets on top.) But it was chilly even so, and theground was hard and lumpy. The Marsh-wiggle told them they would feel morecomfortable if only they thought how very much colder it would be later on and farthernorth; but this didn't cheer them up at all.

They travelled across Ettinsmoor for many days, saving the bacon and living chiefly onthe moor-fowl (they were not, of course, talking birds) which Eustace and the wiggleshot. Jill rather envied Eustace for being able to shoot; he had learned it on his voyagewith King Caspian. As there were countless streams on the moor, they were never shortof water. Jill thought that when, in books, people live on what they shoot, it never tellsyou what a long, smelly, messy job it is plucking and cleaning dead birds, and how cold itmakes your fingers. But the great thing was that they met hardly any giants. One giantsaw them, but he only roared with laughter and stumped away about his own business.

About the tenth day, they reached a place where the country changed. They came to thenorthern edge of the moor and looked down a long, steep slope into a different, andgrimmer, land. At the bottom of the slope were cliffs: beyond these, a country of highmountains, dark precipices, stony valleys, ravines so deep and narrow that one could notsee far into them, and rivers that poured out of echoing gorges to plunge sullenly intoblack depths. Needless to say, it was Puddleglum who pointed out a sprinkling of snowon the more distant slopes.

"But there'll be more on the north side of them, I shouldn't wonder," he added.

It took them some time to reach the foot of the slope and, when they did, they lookeddown from the top of the cliffs at a river running below them from west to east. It waswalled in by precipices on the far side as well as on their own, and it was green andsunless, full of rapids and waterfalls. The roar of it shook the earth even where theystood.

"The bright side of it is," said Puddleglum, "that if we break our necks getting down thecliff, then we're safe from being drowned in the river."

"What about that?" said Scrubb suddenly, pointing upstream to their left. Then they alllooked and saw the last thing they were expecting - a bridge. And what a bridge, too! Itwas a huge, single arch that spanned the gorge from cliff-top to cliff-top; and the crownof that arch was as high above the cliff-tops as the dome of St Paul's is above the street.

"Why, it must be a giants' bridge!" said Jill.

"Or a sorcerer's, more likely," said Puddleglum. "We've got to look out for enchantmentsin a place like this. I think it's a trap. I think it'll turn into mist and melt away just whenwe're out on the middle of it."

"Oh, for goodness' sake, don't be such a wet blanket," said Scrubb. "Why on earthshouldn't it be a proper bridge?"

"Do you think any of the giants we've seen would have sense to build a thing like that?"said Puddleglum.

"But mightn't it have been built by other giants?" said Jill. "I mean, by giants who livedhundreds of years ago, and were far cleverer than the modern kind. It might have beenbuilt by the same ones who built the giant city we're looking for. And that would meanwe were on the right track - the old bridge leading to the old city!"

"That's a real brain-wave, Pole," said Scrubb. "It must be that. Come on."

So they turned and went to the bridge. And when they reached it, it certainly seemedsolid enough. The single stones were as big as those at Stonehenge and must have beensquared by good masons once, though now they were cracked and crumbled. Thebalustrade had apparently been covered with rich carvings, of which some tracesremained; mouldering faces and forms of giants, minotaurs, squids, centipedes, anddreadful gods. Puddleglum still didn't trust it, but he consented to cross it with thechildren.

The climb up to the crown of the arch was long and heavy. In many places the greatstones had dropped out, leaving horrible gaps through which you looked down on theriver foaming thousands of feet below. They saw an eagle fly through under their feet.

And the higher they went, the colder it grew, and the wind blew so that they could hardlykeep their footing. It seemed to shake the bridge.

When they reached the top and could look down the farther slope of the bridge, they sawwhat looked like the remains of an ancient giant road stretching away before them intothe heart of the mountains. Many stones of its pavement were missing and there werewide patches of grass between those that remained. And riding towards them on thatancient road were two people of normal grown-up human size.

"Keep on. Move towards them," said Puddleglum. "Anyone you meet in a place like thisis as likely as not to be an enemy, but we mustn't let them think we're afraid."

By the time they had stepped off the end of the bridge on to the grass, the two strangerswere quite close. One was a knight in complete armour with his visor down. His armourand his horse were black; there was no device on his shield and no banneret on his spear.

The other was a lady on a white horse, a horse so lovely that you wanted to kiss its noseand give it a lump of sugar at once. But the lady, who rode side-saddle and wore a long,fluttering dress of dazzling green, was lovelier still.

"Good day, t-r-r-avellers," she cried out in a voice as sweet as the sweetest bird's song,trilling her R's delightfully. "Some of you are young pilgrims to walk this rough waste."

"That's as may be, Ma'am," said Puddleglum very stiffly and on his guard.

"We're looking for the ruined city of the giants," said Jill.

"The r-r-ruined city?" said the Lady. "That is a strange place to be seeking. What will youdo if you find it?"

"We've got to -" began Jill, but Puddleglum interrupted.

"Begging your pardon, Ma'am. But we don't know you or your friend - a silent chap, isn'the? - and you don't know us. And we'd as soon not talk to strangers about our business, ifyou don't mind. Shall we have a little rain soon, do you think?"

The Lady laughed: the richest, most musical laugh you can imagine. "Well, children," shesaid, "you have a wise, solemn old guide with you. I think none the worse of him forkeeping his own counsel, but I'll be free with mine. I have often heard the name of thegiantish City Ruinous, but never met any who would tell me the way thither. This roadleads to the burgh and castle of Harfang, where dwell the gentle giants. They are as mild,civil, prudent, and courteous as those of Ettinsmoor are foolish, fierce, savage, and givento all beastliness. And in Harfang you may or may not hear tidings of the City Ruinous,but certainly you shall find good lodgings and merry hosts. You would be wise to winterthere, or, at the least, to tarry certain days for your ease and refreshment. There you shallhave steaming baths, soft beds, and bright hearths; and the roast and the baked and thesweet and the strong will be on the table four times in a day."

"I say!" exclaimed Scrubb. "That's something like! Think of sleeping in a bed again."

"Yes, and having a hot bath," said Jill. "Do you think they'll ask us to stay? We don'tknow them, you see."

"Only tell them," answered the Lady, "that She of the Green Kirtle salutes them by you,and has sent them two fair Southern children for the Autumn Feast."

"Oh, thank you, thank you ever so much," said Jill and Scrubb.

"But have a care," said the Lady. "On whatever day you reach Harfang, that you comenot to the door too late. For they shut their gates a few hours after noon, and it is thecustom of the castle that they open to none when once they have drawn bolt, how hard soever he knock."

The children thanked her again, with shining eyes, and the Lady waved to them. TheMarsh-wiggle took off his steeple-hat and bowed very stiffly. Then the silent Knight andthe Lady started walking their horses up the slope of the bridge with a great clatter ofhoofs.

"Well!" said Puddleglum. "I'd give a good deal to know where she's coming from andwhere she's going. Not the sort you expect to meet in the wilds of Giantland, is she? Upto no good, I'll be bound."

"Oh rot!" said Scrubb. "I thought she was simply super. And think of hot meals and warmrooms. I do hope Harfang isn't a long way off."

"Same here," said Jill. "And hadn't she a scrumptious dress. And the horse!"

"All the same," said Puddleglum, "I wish we knew a bit more about her."

"I was going to ask her all about herself," said Jill. "But how could I when you wouldn'ttell her anything about us?"

"Yes," said Scrubb. "And why were you so stiff and unpleasant. Didn't you like them?"

"Them?" said the wiggle. "Who's them? I only saw one."

"Didn't you see the Knight?" asked Jill.

"I saw a suit of armour," said Puddleglum. "Why didn't he speak?"

"I expect he was shy," said Jill. "Or perhaps he just wants to look at her and listen to herlovely voice. I'm sure I would if I was him."

"I was wondering," remarked Puddleglum, "what you'd really see if you lifted up thevisor of that helmet and looked inside."

"Hang it all," said Scrubb. "Think of the shape of the armour! What could be inside itexcept a man?"

"How about a skeleton?" asked the Marsh-wiggle with ghastly cheerfulness. "Orperhaps," he added as an afterthought, "nothing at all. I mean, nothing you could see.

Someone invisible."

"Really, Puddleglum," said Jill with a shudder, "you do have the most horrible ideas.

How do you think of them all?"

"Oh, bother his ideas!" said Scrubb. "He's always expecting the worst, and he's alwayswrong. Let's think about those Gentle Giants and get on to Harfang as quickly as we can.

I wish I knew how far it is."

And now they nearly had the first of those quarrels which Puddleglum had foretold: notthat Jill and Scrubb hadn't been sparring and snapping at each other a good deal before,but this was the first really serious disagreement. Puddleglum didn't want them to go toHarfang at all. He said that he didn't know what a giant's idea of being "gentle" might be,and that, anyway, Aslan's signs had said nothing about staying with giants, gentle orotherwise. The children, on the other hand, who were sick of wind and rain, and skinnyfowl roasted over campfires, and hard, cold earth to sleep on, were absolutely dead set tovisit the Gentle Giants. In the end, Puddleglum agreed to do so, but only on onecondition. The others must give an absolute promise that, unless he gave them leave, theywould not tell the Gentle Giants that they came from Narnia or that they were looking forPrince Rilian. And they gave him this promise, and went on.

After that talk with the Lady things got worse in two different ways. In the first place thecountry was much harder. The road led through endless, narrow valleys down which acruel north wind was always blowing in their faces. There was nothing that could be usedfor firewood, and there were no nice little hollows to camp in, as there had been on themoor. And the ground was all stony, and made your feet sore by day and every bit of yousore by night.

In the second place, whatever the Lady had intended by telling them about Harfang, theactual effect on the children was a bad one. They could think about nothing but beds andbaths and hot meals and how lovely it would be to get indoors. They never talked aboutAslan, or even about the lost prince, now. And Jill gave up her habit of repeating thesigns over to herself every night and morning. She said to herself, at first, that she wastoo tired, but she soon forgot all about it. And though you might have expected that theidea of having a good time at Harfang would have made them more cheerful, it reallymade them more sorry for themselves and more grumpy and snappy with each other andwith Puddleglum.

At last they came one afternoon to a place where the gorge in which they were travellingwidened out and dark fir woods rose on either side. They looked ahead and saw that theyhad come through the mountains. Before them lay a desolate, rocky plain: beyond it,further mountains capped with snow. But between them and those further mountains rosea low hill with an irregular flattish top.

"Look! Look!" cried Jill, and pointed across the plain; and there, through the gatheringdusk, from beyond the flat hill, everyone saw lights. Lights! Not moonlight, nor fires, buta homely cheering row of lighted windows. If you have never been in the wildwilderness, day and night, for weeks, you will hardly understand how they felt.

"Harfang!" cried Scrubb and Jill in glad, excited voices; and "Harfang," repeatedPuddleglum in a dull, gloomy voice. But he added, "Hullo! Wild geese!" and had the bow

off his shoulder in a second. He brought down a good fat goose. It was far too late tothink of reaching Harfang that day. But they had a hot meal and a fire, and started thenight warmer than they had been for over a week. After the fire had gone out, the nightgrew bitterly cold, and when they woke next morning, their blankets were stiff with frost.

"Never mind!" said Jill, stamping her feet. "Hot baths tonight!"
