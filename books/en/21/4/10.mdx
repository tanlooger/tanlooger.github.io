title: CHAPTER 10. TRAVELS WITHOUT THE SUN
---

"WHO's there?" shouted the three travellers.

"I am the Warden of the Marches of Underland, and with me stand a hundred Earthmenin arms," came the reply. "Tell me quickly who you are and what is your errand in theDeep Realm?"

"We fell down by accident," said Puddleglum, truthfully enough.

"Many fall down, and few return to the sunlit lands," said the voice. "Make ready now tocome with me to the Queen of the Deep Realm."

"What does she want with us?" asked Scrubb cautiously.

"I do not know," said the voice. "Her will is not to be questioned but obeyed."

While he said these words there was a noise like a soft explosion and immediately a coldlight, grey with a little blue in it, flooded the cavern. All hope that the speaker had beenidly boasting when he spoke of his hundred armed followers died at once. Jill foundherself blinking and staring at a dense crowd. They were of all sizes, from little gnomesbarely a foot high to stately figures taller than men. All carried three-pronged spears intheir hands, and all were dreadfully pale, and all stood as still as statues. Apart from that,they were very different; some had tails and others not, some wore great beards andothers had very round, smooth faces, big as pumpkins. There were long, pointed noses,and long, soft noses like small trunks, and great blobby noses. Several had single horns inthe middle of their foreheads. But in one respect they were all alike: every face in thewhole hundred was as sad as a face could be. They were so sad that, after the first glance,Jill almost forgot to be afraid of them. She felt she would like to cheer them up.

"Well!" said Puddleglum, rubbing his hands. "This is just what I needed. If these chapsdon't teach me to take a serious view of life, I don't know what will. Look at that fellowwith the walrus moustache - or that one with the -"

"Get up," said the leader of the Earthmen.

There was nothing else to be done. The three travellers scrambled to their feet and joinedhands. One wanted the touch of a friend's hand at a moment like that. And the Earthmencame all round them, padding on large, soft feet, on which some had ten toes, sometwelve, and others none.

"March," said the Warden: and march they did.

The cold light came from a large ball on the top of a long pole, and the tallest of thegnomes carried this at the head of the procession. By its cheerless rays they could see thatthey were in a natural cavern; the walls and roof were knobbed, twisted, and gashed intoa thousand fantastic shapes, and the stony floor sloped downward as they proceeded. Itwas worse for Jill than for the others, because she hated dark, underground places. Andwhen, as they went on, the cave got lower and narrower, and when, at last, the light-

bearer stood aside, and the gnomes, one by one, stooped down (all except the verysmallest ones) and stepped into a little dark crack and disappeared, she felt she could bearit no longer.

"I can't go in there, I can't! I can't! I won't," she panted. The Earthmen said nothing butthey all lowered their spears and pointed them at her.

"Steady, Pole," said Puddleglum. "Those big fellows wouldn't be crawling in there if itdidn't get wider later on. And there's one thing about this underground work, we shan'tget any rain."

"Oh, you don't understand. I can't," wailed Jill.

"Think how 1 felt on that cliff, Pole," said Scrubb. "You go first, Puddleglum, and I'llcome after her."

"That's right," said the Marsh-wiggle, getting down on his hands and knees. "You keep agrip of my heels, Pole, and Scrubb will hold on to yours. Then we'll all be comfortable."

"Comfortable!" said Jill. But she got down and they crawled in on their elbows. It was anasty place. You had to go flat on your face for what seemed like half an hour, though itmay really have been only five minutes. It was hot. Jill felt she was being smothered. Butat last a dim light showed ahead, the tunnel grew wider and higher, and they came out,hot, dirty, and shaken, into a cave so large that it scarcely seemed like a cave at all.

It was full of a dim, drowsy radiance, so that here they had no need of the Earthmen'sstrange lantern. The floor was soft with some kind of moss and out of this grew manystrange shapes, branched and tall like trees, but flabby like mushrooms. They stood toofar apart to make a forest; it was more like a park. The light (a greenish grey) seemed tocome both from them and from the moss, and it was not strong enough to reach the roof

of the cave, which must have been a long way overhead. Across the mild, soft, sleepyplace they were now made to march. It was very sad, but with a quiet sort of sadness likesoft music.

Here they passed dozens of strange animals lying on the turf, either dead or asleep, Jillcould not tell which. These were mostly of a dragonish or bat-like sort; Puddleglum didnot know what any of them were.

"Do they grow here?" Scrubb asked the Warden. He seemed very surprised at beingspoken to, but replied, "No. They are all beasts that have found their way down bychasms and caves, out of Overland into the Deep Realm. Many come down, and fewreturn to the sunlit lands. It is said that they will all wake at the end of the world."

His mouth shut like a box when he had said this, and in the great silence of that cave thechildren felt that they would not dare to speak again. The bare feet of the gnomes,padding on the deep moss, made no sound. There was no wind, there were no birds, therewas no sound of water. There was no sound of breathing from the strange beasts.

When they had walked for several miles, they came to a wall of rock, and in it a lowarchway leading into another cavern. It was not, however, so bad as the last entrance andJill could go through it without bending her head. It brought them into a smaller cave,long and narrow, about the shape and size of a cathedral. And here, filling almost thewhole length of it, lay an enormous man fast asleep. He was far bigger than any of thegiants, and his face was not like a giant's, but noble and beautiful. His breast rose and fellgently under the snowy beard which covered him to the waist. A pure, silver light (no onesaw where it came from) rested upon him.

"Who's that?" asked Puddleglum. And it was so long since anyone had spoken, that Jillwondered how he had the nerve.

"That is old Father Time, who once was a King in Overland," said the Warden. "And nowhe has sunk down into the Deep Realm and lies dreaming of all the things that are done inthe upper world. Many sink down, and few return to the sunlit lands. They say he willwake at the end of the world."

And out of that cave they passed into another, and then into another and another, and soon till Jill lost count, but always they were going downhill and each cave was lower thanthe last, till the very thought of the weight and depth of earth above you was suffocating.

At last they came to a place where the Warden commanded his cheerless lantern to be litagain. Then they passed into a cave so wide and dark that they could see nothing of itexcept that right in front of them a strip of pale sand ran down into still water. And there,beside a little jetty, lay a ship without mast or sail but with many oars. They were made togo on board her and led forward to the bows where there was a clear space in front of therowers' benches and a seat running round inside the bulwarks.

"One thing I'd like to know," said Puddleglum, "is whether anyone from our world - fromup-a-top, I mean has ever done this trip before?"

"Many have taken ship at the pale beaches," replied the Warden, "and-"

"Yes, I know," interrupted Puddleglum. "And few return to the sunlit lands. You needn'tsay it again. You are a chap of one idea, aren't you?"

The children huddled close together on each side of Puddleglum. They had thought him awet blanket while they were still above ground, but down here he seemed the onlycomforting thing they had. Then the pale lantern was hung up amidships, the Earthmensat to the oars, and the ship began to move. The lantern cast its light only a very shortway. Looking ahead, they could see nothing but smooth, dark water, fading into absoluteblackness.

"Oh, whatever will become of us?" said Jill despairingly.

"Now don't you let your spirits down, Pole," said the Marsh-wiggle. "There's one thingyou've got to remember. We're back on the right lines. We were to go under the RuinedCity, and we are under it. We're following the instructions again."

Presently they were given food - flat, flabby cakes of some sort which had hardly anytaste. And after that, they gradually fell asleep. But when they woke, everything was justthe same; the gnomes still rowing, the ship still gliding on, still dead blackness ahead.

How often they woke and slept and ate and slept again, none of them could everremember. And the worst thing about it was that you began to feel as if you had alwayslived on that ship, in that darkness, and to wonder whether sun and blue skies and windand birds had not been only a dream.

They had almost given up hoping or being afraid about anything when at last they sawlights ahead: dreary lights, like that of their own lantern. Then, quite suddenly, one ofthese lights came close and they saw that they were passing another ship. After that theymet several ships. Then, staring till their eyes hurt, they saw that some of the lights aheadwere shining on what looked like wharfs, walls, towers, and moving crowds. But stillthere was hardly any noise.

"By Jove," said Scrubb. "A city!" and soon they all saw that he was right.

But it was a queer city. The lights were so few and far apart that they would hardly havedone for scattered cottages in our world. But the little bits of the place which you couldsee by the lights were like glimpses of a great seaport. You could make out in one place awhole crowd of ships loading or unloading; in another, bales of stuff and warehouses; ina third, walls and pillars that suggested great palaces or temples; and always, whereverthe light fell, endless crowds - hundreds of Earthmen, jostling one another as they paddedsoftly about their business in narrow streets, broad squares, or up great flights of steps.

Their continued movement made a sort of soft, murmuring noise as the ship drew nearer

and nearer; but there was not a song or a shout or a bell or the rattle of a wheel anywhere.

The City was as quiet, and nearly as dark, as the inside of an ant-hill.

At last their ship was brought alongside a quay and made fast. The three travellers weretaken ashore and marched up into the City. Crowds of Earthmen, no two alike, rubbedshoulders with them in the crowded streets, and the sad light fell on many sad andgrotesque faces. But no one showed any interest in the strangers. Every gnome seemed tobe as busy as it was sad, though Jill never found what they were so busy about. But theendless moving, shoving, hurrying, and the soft pad-pad-pad went on.

At last they came to what appeared to be a great castle, though few of the windows in itwere lighted. Here they were taken in and made to cross a courtyard, and to climb manystaircases. This brought them in the end to a great murkily lit room. But in one corner ofit - oh joy! - there was an archway filled with a quite different sort of light; the honest,yellowish, warm light of such a lamp as humans use. What showed by this light inside thearchway was the foot of a staircase which wound upward between walls of stone. Thelight seemed to come from the top. Two Earthmen stood one on each side of the arch likesentries, or footmen.

The Warden went up to these two, and said, as if it were a password:

"Many sink down to the Underworld."

"And few return to the sunlit lands," they answered, as if it were the countersign. Then allthree put their heads together and talked. At last one of the two gnomes-in-waiting said,"I tell you the Queen's grace is gone from hence on her great affair. We had best keepthese top dwellers in strait prison till her homecoming. Few return to the sunlit lands."

At that moment the conversation was interrupted by what seemed to Jill the mostdelightful noise in the world. It came from above, from the top of the staircase; and it wasa clear, ringing, perfectly human voice, the voice of a young man.

"What coil are you keeping down there, Mullugutherum?" it shouted. "Overworlders, ha!

Bring them up to me, and that presently."

"Please it your Highness to remember," began Mullugutherum, but the voice cut himshort.

"It pleases my Highness principally to be obeyed, old mutterer. Bring them up," it called.

Mullugutherum shook his head, motioned to the travellers to follow and began going upthe staircase. At every step the light increased. There were rich tapestries hanging on thewalls. The lamplight shone golden through thin curtains at the staircase-head. TheEarthmen parted the curtains and stood aside. The three passed in. They were in abeautiful room, richly tapestried, with a bright fire on a clean hearth, and red wine andcut glass sparkling on the table. A young man with fair hair rose to greet them. He was

handsome and looked both bold and kind, though there was something about his face thatdidn't seem quite right. He was dressed in black and altogether looked a little bit likeHamlet.

"Welcome, Overworlders," he cried. "But stay a moment! I cry you mercy! I have seenyou two fair children, and this, your strange governor, before. Was it not you three thatmet me by the bridge on the borders of Ettinsmoor when I rode there by my Lady's side?"

"Oh . . . you were the black knight who never spoke?" exclaimed Jill.

"And was that lady the Queen of Underland?" asked Puddleglum, in no very friendlyvoice. And Scrubb, who was thinking the same, burst out, "Because if it was, I think shewas jolly mean to send us off to a castle of giants who intended to eat us. What harm hadwe ever done her, I should like to know?"

"How?" said the Black Knight with a frown. "If you were not so young a warrior, Boy,you and I must have fought to the death on this quarrel. I can hear no words against myLady's honour. But of this you may be assured, that whatever she said to you, she said ofa good intent. You do not know her. She is a nosegay of all virtues, as truth, mercy,constancy, gentleness, courage, and the rest. I say what I know. Her kindness to mealone, who can in no way reward her, would make an admirable history. But you shallknow and love her hereafter. Meanwhile, what is your errand in the Deep Lands?"

And before Puddleglum could stop her, Jill blurted out, "Please we are trying to findPrince Rilian of Narnia." And then she realized what a frightful risk she had taken; thesepeople might be enemies. But the Knight showed no interest.

"Rilian? Narnia?" he said carelessly. "Narnia? What land is that? I have never heard thename. It must be a thousand leagues from those parts of the Overworld that I know. But itwas a strange fantasy that brought you seeking this - how do you call him? - Billian?

Trillian? in my Lady's realm. Indeed, to my certain knowledge, there is no such manhere." He laughed very loudly at this, and Jill thought to herself, "I wonder is that what'swrong with his face? Is he a bit silly?"

"We had been told to look for a message on the stones of the City Ruinous," said Scrubb.

"And we saw the words UNDER ME."

The Knight laughed even more heartily than before. "You were the more deceived," hesaid. "Those words meant nothing to your purpose. Had you but asked my Lady, shecould have given you better counsel. For those words are all that is left of a longer script,which in ancient times, as she well remembers, expressed this verse:

Though under Earth and throneless now I be, Yet, while I lived, all Earth was under me.

From which it is plain that some great king of the ancient giants, who lies buried there,caused this boast to be cut in the stone over his sepulchre; though the breaking up of

some stones, and the carrying away of others for new buildings, and the filling up of thecuts with rubble, has left only two words that can still be read. Is it not the merriest jest inthe world that you should have thought they were written to you?"

This was like cold water down the back to Scrubb and

Jill; for it seemed to them very likely that the words had nothing to do with their quest atall, and that they had been taken in by a mere accident.

"Don't you mind him," said Puddleglum. "There are no accidents. Our guide is Aslan; andhe was there when the giant King caused the letters to be cut, and he knew already allthings that would come of them; including this."

"This guide of yours must be a long liver, friend," said the Knight with another of hislaughs.

Jill began to find them a little irritating.

"And it seems to me, Sir," answered Puddleglum, "that this Lady of yours must be a longliver too, if she remembers the verse as it was when they first cut it."

"Very shrewd, Frog-face," said the Knight, clapping Puddleglum on the shoulder andlaughing again. "And you have hit the truth. She is of divine race, and knows neither agenor death. I am the more thankful to her for all her infinite bounty to such a poor mortalwretch as I. For you must know, Sirs, I am a man under most strange afflictions, andnone but the Queen's grace would have had patience with me. Patience, said I? But itgoes far beyond that. She has promised me a great kingdom in Overland, and, when I amking, her own most gracious hand in marriage. But the tale is too long for you to hearfasting and standing. Hi there, some of you! Bring wine and Updwellers' food for myguests. Please you, be seated, gentlemen. Little maiden, sit in this chair. You shall hear itall."
