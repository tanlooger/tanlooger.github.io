title: CHAPTER 7. THE HILL OF THE STRANGE TRENCHES
---

THERE Is no denying it was a beast of a day. Overhead was a sunless sky, muffled inclouds that were heavy with snow; underfoot, a black frost; blowing over it, a wind thatfelt as if it would take your skin off. When they got down into the plain they found thatthis part of the ancient road was much more ruinous than any they had yet seen. They hadto pick their way over great broken stones and between boulders and across rubble: hardgoing for sore feet. And, however tired they got, it was far too cold for a halt.

At about ten o'clock the first tiny snow flakes came loitering down and settled on Jill'sarm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground wasnoticeably white. And by the end of half an hour a good steady snowstorm, which lookedas if it meant to last all day, was driving in their faces so that they could hardly see.

In order to understand what followed, you must keep on remembering how little theycould see. As they drew near the low hill which separated them from the place where thelighted windows had appeared, they had no general view of it at all. It was a question ofseeing the next few paces ahead, and, even for that, you had to screw up your eyes.

Needless to say, they were not talking.

When they reached the foot of the hill they caught a glimpse of what might be rocks oneach side - squarish rocks, if you looked at them carefully, but no one did. All were moreconcerned with the ledge right in front of them which barred their way. It was about fourfeet high. The Marsh-wiggle, with his long legs, had no difficulty in jumping onto the topof it, and he then helped the others up. It was a nasty wet business for them, though notfor him, because the snow now lay quite deep on the ledge. They then had a stiff climb -

Jill fell once - up very rough ground for about a hundred yards, and came to a secondledge. There were four of these ledges altogether, at quite irregular intervals.

As they struggled on to the fourth ledge, there was no mistaking the fact that they werenow at the top of the flat hill. Up till now the slope had given them some shelter; here,they got the full fury of the wind. For the hill, oddly enough, was quite as flat on top as ithad looked from a distance: a great level tableland which the storm tore across without

resistance. In most places the snow was still hardly lying at all, for the wind kept catchingit up off the ground in sheets and clouds, and hurling it in their faces. And round their feetlittle eddies of snow ran about as you sometimes see them doing over ice. And, indeed, inmany places, the surface was almost as smooth as ice. But to make matters worse it wascrossed and crisscrossed with curious banks or dykes, which sometimes divided it up intosquares and oblongs. All these of course had to be climbed; they varied from two to fivefeet in height and were about a couple of yards thick. On the north side of each bank thesnow already lay in deep drifts; and after each climb you came down into a drift and gotwet.

Fighting her way forward with hood up and head down and numb hands inside her cloak,Jill had glimpses of other odd things on that horrible tableland - things on her right thatlooked vaguely like factory chimneys, and, on her left, a huge cliff, straighter than anycliff ought to be. But she wasn't at all interested and didn't give them a thought. The onlythings she thought about were her cold hands (and nose and chin and ears) and hot bathsand beds at Harfang.

Suddenly she skidded, slid about five feet, and found herself to her horror sliding downinto a dark, narrow chasm which seemed that moment to have appeared in front of her.

Half a second later she had reached the bottom. She appeared to be in a kind of trench orgroove, only about three feet wide. And though she was shaken by the fall, almost thefirst thing she noticed was the relief of being out of the wind; for the walls of the trenchrose high above her. The next thing she noticed was, naturally, the anxious faces ofScrubb and Puddleglum looking down at her from the edge.

"Are you hurt, Pole?" shouted Scrubb.

"Both legs broken, I shouldn't wonder," shouted Puddleglum.

Jill stood up and explained that she was all right, but they'd have to help her out.

"What is it you've fallen into?" asked Scrubb.

"It's a kind of trench, or it might be a kind of sunken lane or something," said Jill. "It runsquite straight."

"Yes, by Jove," said Scrubb. "And it runs due north! I wonder is it a sort of road? If itwas, we'd be out of this infernal wind down there. Is there a lot of snow at the bottom?"

"Hardly any. It all blows over the top, I suppose."

"What happens farther on?"

"Half a sec. I'll go and see," said Jill. She got up and walked along the trench; but beforeshe had gone far, it turned sharply to the right. She shouted this information back to theothers.

"What's round the corner?" asked Scrubb.

Now it happened that Jill had the same feeling about twisty passages and dark placesunderground, or even nearly underground, that Scrubb had about the edges of cliffs. Shehad no intention of going round that corner alone; especially when she heard Puddleglumbawling out from behind her:

"Be careful, Pole. It's just the sort of place that might lead to a dragon's cave. And in agiant country, there might be giant earth-worms or giant beetles."

"I don't think it goes anywhere much," said Jill, coming hastily back.

"I'm jolly well going to have a look," said Scrubb. "What do you mean by anywheremuch, I should like to know?" So he sat down on the edge of the trench (everyone wastoo wet by now to bother about being a bit wetter) and then dropped in. He pushed pastJill and, though he didn't say anything, she felt sure that he knew she had funked it. Soshe followed him close, but took care not to get in front of him.

It proved, however, a disappointing exploration. They went round the right-hand turn andstraight on for a few paces. Here there was a choice of ways: straight on again, or sharp tothe right. "That's no good," said Scrubb, glancing down the right-hand turn, "that wouldbe taking us back - south." He went straight on, but once more, in a few steps, they founda second turn to the right. But this time there was no choice of ways, for the trench theyhad been following here came to a dead end.

"No good," grunted Scrubb. Jill lost no time in turning and leading the way back. Whenthey returned to the place where Jill had first fallen in, the Marsh-wiggle with his longarms had no difficulty in pulling them out.

But it was dreadful to be out on top again. Down in those narrow slits of trenches, theirears had almost begun to thaw. They had been able to see clearly and breathe easily andhear each other speak without shouting. It was absolute misery to come back into thewithering coldness. And it did seem hard when Puddleglum chose that moment forsaying:

"Are you still sure of those signs, Pole? What's the one we ought to be after, now?"

"Oh, come on! Bother the signs," said Pole. "Something about someone mentioningAslan's name, I think. But I'm jolly well not going to give a recitation here."

As you see, she had got the order wrong. That was because she had given up saying thesigns over every night. She still really knew them, if she troubled to think: but she was nolonger so "pat" in her lesson as to be sure of reeling them off in the right order at amoment's notice and without thinking. Puddleglum's question annoyed her because, deepdown inside her, she was already annoyed with herself for not knowing the Lion's lesson

quite so well as she felt she ought to have known it. This annoyance, added to the miseryof being very cold and tired, made her say, "Bother the signs." She didn't perhaps quitemean it.

"Oh, that was next, was it?" said Puddleglum. "Now I wonder, are you right? Got 'emmixed, I shouldn't wonder. It seems to me, this hill, this flat place we're on, is worthstopping to have a look at. Have you noticed -"

"Oh Lor!" said Scrubb, "is this a time for stopping to admire the view? For goodness'sake let's get on."

"Oh, look, look, look," cried Jill and pointed. Everyone turned, and everyone saw. Someway off to the north, and a good deal higher up than the tableland on which they stood, aline of lights had appeared. This time, even more obviously than when the travellers hadseen them the night before, they were windows: smaller windows that made one thinkdeliciously of bedrooms, and larger windows that made one think of great halls with firesroaring on the hearth and hot soup or juicy sirloins smoking on the table.

"Harfang!" exclaimed Scrubb.

"That's all very well," said Puddleglum. "But what I was saying was -"

"Oh, shut up," said Jill crossly. "We haven't a moment to lose. Don't you remember whatthe Lady said about their locking up so early? We must get there in time, we must, wemust. We'll die if we're shut out on a night like this."

"Well, it isn't exactly a night, not yet," began Puddleglum; but the two children both said,"Come on," and began stumbling forward on the slippery tableland as quickly as theirlegs would carry them. The Marsh-wiggle followed them: still talking, but now that theywere forcing their way into the wind again, they could not have heard him even if theyhad wanted to. And they didn't want. They were thinking of baths and beds and hotdrinks; and the idea of coming to Harfang too late and being shut out was almostunbearable.

In spite of their haste, it took them a long time to cross the flat top of that hill. And evenwhen they had crossed it, there were still several ledges to climb down on the far side.

But at last they reached the bottom and could see what Harfang was like.

It stood on a high crag, and in spite of its many towers was more a huge house than acastle. Obviously, the Gentle Giants feared no attack. There were windows in the outsidewall quite close to the ground - a thing no one would have in a serious fortress. Therewere even odd little doors here and there, so that it would be quite easy to get in and outof the castle without going through the courtyard. This raised the spirits of Jill andScrubb. It made the whole place look more friendly and less forbidding.

At first the height and steepness of the crag frightened them, but presently they noticedthat there was an easier way up on the left and that the road wound up towards it. It was aterrible climb, after the journey they had already had, and Jill nearly gave up. Scrubb andPuddleglum had to help her for the last hundred yards.

But in the end they stood before the castle gate. The portcullis was up and the gate open.

However tired you are, it takes some nerve to walk up to a giant's front door. In spite ofall his previous warnings against Harfang, it was Puddleglum who showed most courage.

"Steady pace, now," he said. "Don't look frightened, whatever you do. We've done thesilliest thing in the world by coming at all: but now that we are here, we'd best put a boldface on it."

With these words he strode forward into the gateway, stood still under the arch where theecho would help his voice, and called out as loud as he could.

"Ho! Porter! Guests who seek lodging."

And while he was waiting for something to happen, he took off his hat and knocked offthe heavy mass of snow which had gathered on its wide brim.

"I say," whispered Scrubb to Jill. "He may be a wet blanket, but he has plenty of pluck -

and cheek."

A door opened, letting out a delicious glow of firelight, and the Porter appeared. Jill bither lips for fear she should scream. He was not a perfectly enormous giant; that is to say,he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole. He hadbristly red hair, a leather jerkin with metal plates fastened all over it so as to make a kindof mail shirt, bare knees (very hairy indeed) and things like puttees on his legs. Hestooped down and goggled at Puddleglum.

"And what sort of creature do you call yourself," he said.

Jill took her courage in both hands. "Please," she said, shouting up at the giant. "TheLady of the Green Kirtle salutes the King of the Gentle Giants, and has sent us twoSouthern children and this Marsh-wiggle (his name's Puddleglum) to your Autumn Feast.

- If it's quite convenient, of course," she added.

"Oho!" said the Porter. "That's quite a different story. Come in, little people, come in.

You'd best come into the lodge while I'm sending word to his Majesty." He looked at thechildren with curiosity. "Blue faces," he said. "I didn't know they. were that colour. Don'tcare about it myself. But I dare say you look quite nice to one another. Beetles fancyother beetles, they do say."

"Our faces are only blue with cold," said Jill. "We're not this colour really."

"Then come in and get warm. Come in, little shrimps," said the Porter. They followedhim into the lodge. And though it was rather terrible to hear such a big door clang shutbehind them, they forgot about it as soon as they saw the thing they had been longing forever since supper time last night - afire. And such a fire! It looked as if four or five wholetrees were blazing on it, and it was so hot they couldn't go within yards of it. But they allflopped down on the brick floor, as near as they could bear the heat, and heaved greatsighs of relief.

"Now, youngster," said the Porter to another giant who had been sitting in the back of theroom, staring at the visitors till it looked as if his eyes would start out of his head, "runacross with this message to the House." And he repeated what Jill had said to him. Theyounger giant, after a final stare, and a great guffaw, left the room.

"Now, Froggy," said the Porter to Puddleglum, "you look as if you wanted some cheeringup." He produced a black bottle very like Puddleglum's own, but about twenty timeslarger. "Let me see, let me see," said the Porter. "I can't give you a cup or you'll drownyourself. Let me see. This salt-cellar will be just the thing. You

needn't mention it over at the House. The silver will keep on getting over here, and it'snot my fault."

The salt-cellar was not very like one of ours, being narrower and more upright, and madequite a good cup for Puddleglum, when the giant set it down on the floor beside him. Thechildren expected Puddleglum to refuse it, distrusting the Gentle Giants as he did. But hemuttered, "It's rather late to be thinking of precautions now that we're inside and the doorshut behind us." Then he sniffed at the liquor. "Smells all right," he said. "But that'snothing to go by. Better make sure," and took a sip. "Tastes all right, too," he said. "But itmight do that at the first sip. How does it go on?" He took a larger sip. "Ah!" he said.

"But is it the same all the way down?" and took another. "There'll be something nasty atthe bottom, I shouldn't wonder," he said, and finished the drink. He licked his lips andremarked to the children, "This'll be a test, you see. If I curl up, or burst, or turn into alizard, or something, then you'll know not to take anything they offer you." But the giant,who was too far up to hear the things Puddleglum had been saying under his breath,roared with laughter and said, "Why, Froggy, you're a man. See him put it away!"

"Not a man . . . Marsh-wiggle," replied Puddleglum in a somewhat indistinct voice. "Notfrog either: Marshwiggle."

At that moment the door opened behind them and the younger giant came in saying,"They're to go to the throne-room at once."

The children stood up but Puddleglum remained sitting and said, "Marsh-wiggle. Marsh-

wiggle. Very respectable Marsh-wiggle. Respectowiggle."

"Show them the way, young 'un," said the giant Porter. "You'd better carry Froggy. He'shad a drop more than's good for him."

"Nothing wrong with me," said Puddleglum. "Not a frog. Nothing frog with me. I'm arespectabiggle."

But the young giant caught him up by the waist and signed to the children to follow. Inthis undignified way they crossed the courtyard. Puddleglum, held in the giant's fist, andvaguely kicking the air, did certainly look very like a frog. But they had little time tonotice this, for they soon entered the great doorway of the main castle - both their heartsbeating faster than usual - and, after pattering along several corridors at a trot to keep upwith the giant's paces, found themselves blinking in the light of an enormous room,where lamps glowed and a fire roared on the hearth and both were reflected from thegilding of roof and cornice. More giants than they could count stood on their left andright, all in magnificent robes; and on two thrones at the far end, sat two huge shapes thatappeared to be the King and Queen.

About twenty feet from the thrones, they stopped. Scrubb and Jill made an awkwardattempt at a bow (girls are not taught how to curtsey at Experiment House) and the younggiant carefully put Puddleglum down on the floor, where he collapsed into a sort ofsitting position. With his long limbs he looked, to tell the truth, uncommonly like a largespider.
