title: CHAPTER 1. BEHIND THE GYM
---

IT was a dull autumn day and Jill Pole was crying behind the gym.

She was crying because they had been bullying her. This is not going to be a school story,so I shall say as little as possible about Jill's school, which is not a pleasant subject. It was"Co-educational," a school for both boys and girls, what used to be called a "mixed"school; some said it was not nearly so mixed as the minds of the people who ran it. Thesepeople had the idea that boys and girls should be allowed to do what they liked. Andunfortunately what ten or fifteen of the biggest boys and girls liked best was bullying theothers. All sorts of things, horrid things, went on which at an ordinary school would havebeen found out and stopped in half a term; but at this school they weren't. Or even if theywere, the people who did them were not expelled or punished. The Head said they wereinteresting psychological cases and sent for them and talked to them for hours. And if youknew the right sort of things to say to the Head, the main result was that you becamerather a favourite than otherwise.

That was why Jill Pole was crying on that dull autumn day on the damp little path whichruns between the back of the gym and the shrubbery. And she hadn't nearly finished hercry when a boy came round the corner of the gym whistling, with his hands in hispockets. He nearly ran into her.

"Can't you look where you're going?" said Jill Pole.

"All right," said the boy, "you needn't start -" and then he noticed her face. "I say, Pole,"he said, "what's up?"

Jill only made faces; the sort you make when you're trying to say something but find thatif you speak you'll start crying again.

"It's Them, I suppose - as usual," said the boy grimly, digging his hands farther into hispockets.

Jill nodded. There was no need for her to say anything, even if she could have said it.

They both knew.

"Now, look here," said the boy, "there's no good us all -"

He meant well, but he did talk rather like someone beginning a lecture. Jill suddenly flewinto a temper (which is quite a likely thing to happen if you have been interrupted in acry).

"Oh, go away and mind your own business," she said. "Nobody asked you to comebarging in, did they? And you're a nice person to start telling us what we all ought to do,aren't you? I suppose you mean we ought to spend all our time sucking up to Them, andcurrying favour, and dancing attendance on Them like you do."

"Oh, Lor!" said the boy, sitting down on the grassy bank at the edge of the shrubbery andvery quickly getting up again because the grass was soaking wet. His name unfortunatelywas Eustace Scrubb, but he wasn't a bad sort.

"Pole!" he said. "Is that fair? Have I been doing anything of the sort this term? Didn't Istand up to Carter about the rabbit? And didn't I keep the secret about Spivvins - undertorture too? And didn't I -"

"I d-don't know and I don't care," sobbed Jill.

Scrubb saw that she wasn't quite herself yet and very sensibly offered her a peppermint.

He had one too. Presently Jill began to see things in a clearer light.

"I'm sorry, Scrubb," she said presently. "I wasn't fair. You have done all that - this term."

"Then wash out last term if you can," said Eustace. "I was a different chap then. I was -

gosh! what a little tick I was."

"Well, honestly, you were," said Jill.

"You think there has been a change, then?" said Eustace.

"It's not only me," said Jill. "Everyone's been saying so. They've noticed it. EleanorBlakiston heard Adela Pennyfather talking about it in our changing room yesterday. Shesaid, `Someone's got hold of that Scrubb kid. He's quite unmanageable this term. Weshall have to attend to him next.'"

Eustace gave a shudder. Everyone at Experiment House knew what it was like being"attended to" by Them.

Both children were quiet for a moment. The drops dripped off the laurel leaves.

"Why were you so different last term?" said Jill presently.

"A lot of queer things happened to me in the hols," said Eustace mysteriously.

"What sort of things?" asked Jill.

Eustace didn't say anything for quite a long time. Then he said:

"Look here, Pole, you and I hate this place about as much as anybody can hate anything,don't we?"

"I know I do," said Jill.

"Then I really think I can trust you."

"Dam' good of you," said Jill.

"Yes, but this is a really terrific secret. Pole, I say, are you good at believing things? Imean things that everyone here would laugh at?"

"I've never had the chance," said Jill, "but I think I would be."

"Could you believe me if I said I'd been right out of the world - outside this world - lasthols?"

"I wouldn't know what you meant."

"Well, don't let's bother about that then. Supposing I told you I'd been in a place whereanimals can talk and where there are - er - enchantments and dragons - and well, all thesorts of things you have in fairy-tales." Scrubb felt terribly awkward as he said this andgot red in the face.

"How did you get there?" said Jill. She also felt curiously shy.

"The only way you can - by Magic," said Eustace almost in a whisper. "I was with twocousins of mine. We were just - whisked away. They'd been there before."

Now that they were talking in whispers Jill somehow felt it easier to believe. Thensuddenly a horrible suspicion came over her and she said (so fiercely that for the momentshe looked like a tigress):

"If I find you've been pulling my leg I'll never speak to you again; never, never, never."

"I'm not," said Eustace. "I swear I'm not. I swear by everything."

(When I was at school one would have said, "I swear by the Bible." But Bibles were notencouraged at Experiment House.)

"All right," said Jill, "I'll believe you."

"And tell nobody?"

"What do you take me for?"

They were very excited as they said this. But when they had said it and Jill looked roundand saw the dull autumn sky and heard the drip off the leaves and thought of all thehopelessness of Experiment House (it was a thirteen-week term and there were stilleleven weeks to come) she said:

"But after all, what's the good? We're not there: we're here. And we jolly well can't getthere. Or can we?"

"That's what I've been wondering," said Eustace. "When we came back from That Place,Someone said that the two Pevensie kids (that's my two cousins) could never go thereagain. It was their third time, you see. I suppose they've had their share. But he never saidI couldn't. Surely he would have said so, unless he meant that I was to get back? And Ican't help wondering, can we - could we -?"

"Do you mean, do something to make it happen?"

Eustace nodded.

"You mean we might draw a circle on the ground - and write in queer letters in it - andstand inside it - and recite charms and spells?"

"Well," said Eustace after he had thought hard for a bit. "I believe that was the sort ofthing I was thinking of, though I never did it. But now that it comes to the point, I've anidea that all those circles and things are rather rot. I don't think he'd like them. It wouldlook as if we thought we could make him do things. But really, we can only ask him."

"Who is this person you keep on talking about?"

"They call him Aslan in That Place," said Eustace.

"What a curious name!"

"Not half so curious as himself," said Eustace solemnly. "But let's get on. It can't do anyharm, just asking. Let's stand side by side, like this. And we'll hold out our arms in frontof us with the palms down: like they did in Ramandu's island -"

"Whose island?"

"I'll tell you about that another time. And he might like us to face the east. Let's see,where is the east?"

"I don't know," said Jill.

"It's an extraordinary thing about girls that they never know the points of the compass,"said Eustace.

"You don't know either," said Jill indignantly.

"Yes I do, if only you didn't keep on interrupting. I've got it now. That's the east, facingup into the laurels. Now, will you say the words after me?''

"What words?" asked Jill.

"The words I'm going to say, of course," answered Eustace. "Now -"

And he began, "Aslan, Aslan, Aslan!"

"Aslan, Aslan, Aslan," repeated Jill.

"Please let us two go into -"

At that moment a voice from the other side of the gym was heard shouting out, "Pole?

Yes. I know where she is. She's blubbing behind the gym. Shall I fetch her out?"

Jill and Eustace gave one glance at each other, dived under the laurels, and beganscrambling up the steep, earthy slope of the shrubbery at a speed which did them greatcredit. (Owing to the curious methods of teaching at Experiment House, one did not learnmuch French or Maths or Latin or things of that sort; but one did learn a lot about gettingaway quickly and quietly when They were looking for one.)

After about a minute's scramble they stopped to listen, and knew by the noises they heardthat they were being followed.

"If only the door was open again!" said Scrubb as they went on, and Jill nodded. For atthe top of the shrubbery was a high stone wall and in that wall a door by which you couldget out on to open moor. This door was nearly always locked. But there had been timeswhen people had found it open; or perhaps there had been only one time. But you mayimagine how the memory of even one time kept people hoping, and trying the door; for ifit should happen to be unlocked it would be a splendid way of getting outside the schoolgrounds without being seen.

Jill and Eustace, now both very hot and very grubby from going along bent almost doubleunder the laurels, panted up to the wall. And there was the door, shut as usual.

"It's sure to be no good," said Eustace with his hand on the handle; and then, "O-o-oh. ByGum!!" For the handle turned and the door opened.

A moment before, both of them had meant to get through that doorway in double quicktime, if by any chance the door was not locked. But when the door actually opened, theyboth stood stock still. For what they saw was quite different from what they hadexpected.

They had expected to see the grey, heathery slope of the moor going up and up to join thedull autumn sky. Instead, a blaze of sunshine met them. It poured through the doorway asthe light of a June day pours into a garage when you open the door. It made the drops ofwater on the grass glitter like beads and showed up the dirtiness of Jill's tear-stained face.

And the sunlight was coming from what certainly did look like a different world - whatthey could see of it. They saw smooth turf, smoother and brighter than Jill had ever seenbefore, and blue sky, and, darting to and fro, things so bright that they might have beenjewels or huge butterflies.

Although she had been longing for something like this, Jill felt frightened. She looked atScrubb's face and saw that he was frightened too.

"Come on, Pole," he said in a breathless voice.

"Can we get back? Is it safe?" asked Jill.

At that moment a voice shouted from behind, a mean, spiteful little voice. "Now then,Pole," it squeaked. "Everyone knows you're there. Down you come." It was the voice ofEdith Jackle, not one of Them herself but one of their hangers-on and tale-bearers.

"Quick!" said Scrubb. "Here. Hold hands. We mustn't get separated." And before shequite knew what was happening, he had grabbed her hand and pulled her through thedoor, out of the school grounds, out of England, out of our whole world into That Place.

The sound of Edith Jackle's voice stopped as suddenly as the voice on the radio when it isswitched off. Instantly there was a quite different sound all about them. It came fromthose bright things overhead, which now turned out to be birds. They were making ariotous noise, but it was much more like music - rather advanced music which you don'tquite take in at the first hearing - than birds' songs ever are in our world. Yet, in spite ofthe singing, there was a sort of background of immense silence. That silence, combinedwith the freshness of the air, made Jill think they must be on the top of a very highmountain.

Scrubb still had her by the hand and they were walking forward, staring about them onevery side. Jill saw that huge trees, rather like cedars but bigger, grew in every direction.

But as they did not grow close together, and as there was no undergrowth, this did notprevent one from seeing a long way into the forest to left and right. And as far as Jill'seye could reach, it was all the same - level turf, darting birds with yellow, or dragonflyblue, or rainbow plumage, blue shadows, and emptiness. There was not a breath of windin that cool, bright air. It was a very lonely forest.

Right ahead there were no trees: only blue sky. They went straight on without speakingtill suddenly Jill heard Scrubb say, "Look out!" and felt herself jerked back. They were atthe very edge of a cliff.

Jill was one of those lucky people who have a good head for heights. She didn't mind inthe least standing on the edge of a precipice. She was rather annoyed with Scrubb forpulling her back - "just as if I was a kid", she said and she wrenched her hand out of his.

When she saw how very white he had turned, she despised him.

"What's the matter?" she said. And to show that she was not afraid, she stood very nearthe edge indeed; in fact, a good deal nearer than even she liked. Then she looked down.

She now realized that Scrubb had some excuse for looking white, for no cliff in our worldis to be compared with this. Imagine yourself at the top of the very highest cliff youknow. And imagine yourself looking down to the very bottom. And then imagine that theprecipice goes on below that, as far again, ten times as far, twenty times as far. And whenyou've looked down all that distance imagine little white things that might, at first glance,be mistaken for sheep, but presently you realize that they are clouds - not little wreaths ofmist but the enormous white, puffy clouds which are themselves as big as mostmountains. And at last, in between those clouds, you get your first glimpse of the realbottom, so far away that you can't make out whether it's field or wood, or land or water:farther below those clouds than you are above them.

Jill stared at it. Then she thought that perhaps, after all, she would step back afoot or sofrom the edge; but she didn't like to for fear of what Scrubb would think. Then shesuddenly decided that she didn't care what he thought, and that she would jolly well getaway from that horrible edge and never laugh at anyone for not liking heights again. Butwhen she tried to move, she found she couldn't. Her legs seemed to have turned intoputty. Everything was swimming before her eyes.

"What are you doing, Pole? Come back-blithering little idiot!" shouted Scrubb. But hisvoice seemed to he coming from a long way off. She felt him grabbing at her. But by nowshe had no control over her own arms and legs. There was a moment's struggling on thecliff edge. Jill was too frightened and dizzy to know quite what she was doing, but twothings she remembered as long as she lived (they often came back to her in dreams). Onewas that she had wrenched herself free of Scrubb's clutches; the other was that, at thesame moment, Scrubb himself, with a terrified scream, had lost his balance and gonehurtling to the depths.

Fortunately, she was given no time to think over what she had done. Some huge, brightlycoloured animal had rushed to the edge of the cliff. It was lying down, leaning over, and(this was the odd thing) blowing. Not roaring or snorting, but just blowing from its wide-

opened mouth; blowing out as steadily as a vacuum cleaner sucks in. Jill was lying soclose to the creature that she could feel the breath vibrating steadily through its body. Shewas lying still because she couldn't get up. She was nearly fainting: indeed, she wished

she could really faint, but faints don't come for the asking. At last she saw, far awaybelow her, a tiny black speck floating away from the cliff and slightly upwards. As itrose, it also got farther away. By the time it was nearly on a level with the cliff-top it wasso far off that she lost sight of it. It was obviously moving away from them at a greatspeed. Jill couldn't help thinking that the creature at her side was blowing it away.

So she turned and looked at the creature. It was a lion.
