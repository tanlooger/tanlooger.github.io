title: CHAPTER 3. THE SAILING OF THE KING
---

WHAT made Scrubb look so dingy (and Jill too, if she could only have seen herself) wasthe splendour of their surroundings. I had better describe them at once.

Through a cleft in those mountains which Jill had seen far inland as she approached theland, the sunset light was pouring over a level lawn. On the far side of the lawn, itsweather-vanes glittering in the light, rose a many-towered and many-turreted castle; themost beautiful castle Jill had ever seen. On the near side was a quay of white marble and,moored to this, the ship: a tall ship with high forecastle and high poop, gilded andcrimson, with a great flag at the mast-head, and many banners waving from the decks,and a row of shields, bright as silver, along the bulwarks. The gang-plank was laid to her,and at the foot of it, just ready to go on board, stood an old, old man. He wore a richmantle of scarlet which opened in front to show his silver mail shirt. There was a thincirclet of gold on his head. His beard, white as wool, fell nearly to his waist. He stoodstraight enough, leaning one hand on the shoulder of a richly dressed lord who seemedyounger than himself: but you could see he was very old and frail. He looked as if a puffof wind could blow him away, and his eyes were watery.

Immediately in front of the King - who had turned round to speak to his people beforegoing on board the ship - there was a little chair on wheels, and, harnessed to it, a littledonkey: not much bigger than a big retriever. In this chair sat a fat little dwarf. He was asrichly dressed as the King, but because of his fatness and because he was sitting hunchedup among cushions, the effect was quite different: it made him look like a shapeless littlebundle of fur and silk and velvet. He was as old as the King, but more hale and hearty,with very keen eyes. His bare head, which was bald and extremely large, shone like agigantic billiard ball in the sunset light.

Farther back, in a half-circle, stood what Jill at once knew to be the courtiers. They werewell worth looking at for their clothes and armour alone. As far as that went, they lookedmore like a flower-bed than a crowd. But what really made Jill open her eyes and mouthas wide as they would go, was the people themselves. If "people" was the right word. Foronly about one in every five was human. The rest were things you never see in our world.

Fauns, satyrs, centaurs: Jill could give a name to these, for she had seen pictures of them.

Dwarfs too. And there were a lot of animals she knew as well; bears, badgers, moles,leopards, mice, and various birds. But then they were so very different from the animalswhich one called by the same names in England. Some of them were much bigger - themice, for instance, stood on their hind legs and were over two feet high. But quite apartfrom that, they all looked different. You could see by the expression in their faces thatthey could talk and think just as well as you could.

"Golly!" thought Jill. "So it's true after all." But next moment she added, "I wonder arethey friendly?" For she had just noticed, on the outskirts of the crowd, one or two giantsand some people whom she couldn't give a name to at all.

At that moment Aslan and the signs rushed back into her mind. She had forgotten allabout them for the last half-hour.

"Scrubb!" she whispered, grabbing his arm. "Scrubb, quick! Do you see anyone youknow?"

"So you've turned up again, have you?" said Scrubb disagreeably (for which he had somereason). "Well, keep quiet, can't you? I want to listen."

"Don't be a fool," said Jill. "There isn't a moment to lose. Don't you see some old friendhere? Because you've got to go and speak to him at once."

"What are you talking about?" said Scrubb.

"It's Aslan - the Lion - says you've got to," said Jill despairingly. "I've seen him."

"Oh, you have, have you? What did he say?"

"He said the very first person you saw in Narnia would be an old friend, and you'd got tospeak to him at once."

"Well, there's nobody here I've ever seen in my life before; and anyway, I don't knowwhether this is Narnia."

"Thought you said you'd been here before," said Jill.

"Well, you thought wrong then."

"Well, I like that! You told me -"

"For heaven's sake dry up and let's hear what they're saying."

The King was speaking to the Dwarf, but Jill couldn't hear what he said. And, as far asshe could make out, the Dwarf made no answer, though he nodded and wagged his head agreat deal. Then the King raised his voice and addressed the whole court: but his voicewas so old and cracked that she could understand very little of his speech - especiallysince it was all about people and places she had never heard of. When the speech wasover, the King stooped down and kissed the Dwarf on both cheeks, straightened himself,raised his right hand as if in blessing, and went, slowly and with feeble steps, up thegangway and on board the ship. The courtiers appeared to be greatly moved by hisdeparture. Handkerchiefs were got out, sounds of sobbing were heard in every direction.

The gangway was cast off, trumpets sounded from the poop, and the ship moved awayfrom the quay. (It was being towed by a rowing-boat, but Jill didn't see that.)

"Now -" said Scrubb, but he didn't get any farther, because at that moment a large whiteobject - Jill thought for a second that it was a kite - came gliding through the air andalighted at his feet. It was a white owl, but so big that it stood as high as a good-sizeddwarf.

It blinked and peered as if it were short-sighted, and put its head a little on one side, andsaid in a soft, hooting kind of voice:

"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo! Who are you two?"

"My name's Scrubb, and this is Pole," said Eustace. "Would you mind telling us wherewe are?"

"In the land of Narnia, at the King's castle of Cair Paravel."

"Is that the King who's just taken ship?"

"Too true, too true," said the Owl sadly, shaking its big head. "But who are you? There'ssomething magic about you two. I saw you arrive: you flew. Everyone else was so busyseeing the King off that nobody knew. Except me. I happened to notice you, you flew."

"We were sent here by Aslan," said Eustace in a low voice.

"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!" said the Owl, ruffling out its feathers. "This is almost too much forme, so early in the evening. I'm not quite myself till the sun's down."

"And we've been sent to find the lost Prince," said Jill, who had been anxiously waiting toget into the conversation.

"It's the first I've heard about it," said Eustace. "What prince?"

"You had better come and speak to the Lord Regent at once," it said. "That's him, overthere in the donkey carriage; Trumpkin the Dwarf." The bird turned and began leadingthe way, muttering to itself, "Whoo! Tu-whoo! What a to-do! I can't think clearly yet. It'stoo early."

"What is the King's name?" asked Eustace.

"Caspian the Tenth," said the Owl. And Jill wondered why Scrubb had suddenly pulledup short in his walk and turned an extraordinary colour. She thought she had never seenhim look so sick about anything. But before she had time to ask any questions they hadreached the dwarf, who was just gathering up the reins of his donkey and preparing todrive back to the castle. The crowd of courtiers had broken up and were going in thesame direction, by ones and twos and little knots, like people coming away fromwatching a game or a race.

"Tu-whoo! Ahem! Lord Regent," said the Owl, stooping down a little and holding itsbeak near the Dwarf's ear.

"Heh? What's that?" said the Dwarf.

"Two strangers, my lord," said the Owl.

"Rangers! What d'ye mean?" said the Dwarf. "I see two uncommonly grubby man-cubs.

What do they want?"

"My name's Jill," said Jill, pressing forward. She was very eager to explain the importantbusiness on which they had come.

"The girl's called Jill," said the Owl, as loud as it could.

"What's that?" said the Dwarf. "The girls are all killed! I don't believe a word of it. Whatgirls? Who killed 'em?"

"Only one girl, my lord," said the Owl. "Her name is Jill."

"Speak up, speak up," said the Dwarf. "Don't stand there buzzing and twittering in myear. Who's been killed?"

"Nobody's been killed," hooted the Owl.

"Who?"

"NOBODY."

"All right, all right. You needn't shout. I'm not so deaf as all that. What do you mean bycoming here to tell me that nobody's been killed? Why should anyone have been killed?"

"Better tell him I'm Eustace," said Scrubb.

"The boy's Eustace, my lord," hooted the Owl as loud as it could.

"Useless?" said the Dwarf irritably. "I dare say he is. Is that any reason for bringing himto court? Hey?"

"Not useless," said the Owl. "EUSTACE."

"Used to it, is he? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm sure. I tell you what it is,Master Glimfeather; when I was a young Dwarf there used to be talking beasts and birdsin this country who really could talk. There wasn't all this mumbling and muttering andwhispering. It wouldn't have been tolerated for a moment. Not for a moment, Sir. Urnus,my trumpet please -"

A little Faun who had been standing quietly beside the Dwarf's elbow all this time nowhanded him a silver eartrumpet. It was made like the musical instrument called a serpent,so that the tube curled right round the Dwarf's neck. While he was getting it settled theOwl, Glimfeather, suddenly said to the children in a whisper:

"My brain's a bit clearer now. Don't say anything about the lost Prince. I'll explain later. Itwouldn't do, wouldn't do, Tu-Whoo! Oh what a to-do!"

"Now," said the Dwarf, "if you have anything sensible to say, Master Glimfeather, tryand say it. Take a deep breath and don't attempt to speak too quickly."

With help from the children, and in spite of a fit of coughing on the part of the Dwarf,Glimfeather explained that the strangers had been sent by Aslan to visit the court ofNarnia. The Dwarf glanced quickly up at them with a new expression in his eyes.

"Sent by the Lion Himself, hey?" he said. "And from m'm - from that other Place -

beyond the world's end, hey?"

"Yes, my lord," bawled Eustace into the trumpet.

"Son of Adam and Daughter of Eve, hey?" said the Dwarf. But people at ExperimentHouse haven't heard of Adam and Eve, so Jill and Eustace couldn't answer this. But theDwarf didn't seem to notice.

"Well, my dears," he said, taking first one and then the other by the hand and bowing hishead a little. "You are very heartily welcome. If the good King, my poor Master, had notthis very hour set sail for Seven Isles, he would have been glad of your coming. It wouldhave brought back his youth to him for a moment - for a moment. And now, it is hightime for supper. You shall tell me your business in full council tomorrow morning.

Master Glimfeather, see that bedchambers and suitable clothes and all else are providedfor these guests in the most honourable fashion. And - Glimfeather - in your ear -"

Here the Dwarf put his mouth close to the Owl's head and, no doubt, intended to whisper:but, like other deaf people, he wasn't a very good judge of his own voice, and bothchildren heard him say, "See that they're properly washed."

After that, the Dwarf touched up his donkey and it set off towards the castle at somethingbetween a trot and a waddle (it was a very fat little beast), while the Faun, the Owl, andthe children followed at a rather slower pace. The sun had set and the air was growingcool.

They went across the lawn and then through an orchard and so to the North Gate of CairParavel, which stood wide open. Inside, they found a grassy courtyard. Lights werealready showing from the windows of the great hall on their right and from a morecomplicated mass of buildings straight ahead. Into these the Owl led them, and there amost delightful person was called to look after Jill. She was not much taller than Jillherself, and a good deal slenderer, but obviously full grown, graceful as a willow, and herhair was willowy too, and there seemed to be moss in it. She brought Jill to a round roomin one of the turrets, where there was a little bath sunk in the floor and a fire of sweet-

smelling woods burning on the flat hearth and a lamp hanging by a silver chain from thevaulted roof. The window looked west into the strange land of Narnia, and Jill saw thered remains of the sunset still glowing behind distant mountains. It made her long formore adventures and feel sure that this was only the beginning.

When she had had her bath, and brushed her hair, and put on the clothes that had beenlaid out for her - they were the kind that not only felt nice, but looked nice and smellednice and made nice sounds when you moved as well - she would have gone back to gazeout of that exciting window, but she was interrupted by a bang on the door.

"Come in," said Jill. And in came Scrubb, also bathed and splendidly dressed in Narnianclothes. But his face didn't look as if he were enjoying it.

"Oh, here you are at last," he said crossly, flinging himself into a chair. "I've been tryingto find you for ever so long."

"Well, now you have," said Jill. "I say, Scrubb, isn't it all simply too exciting andscrumptious for words." She had forgotten all about the signs and the lost Prince for themoment.

"Oh! That's what you think, is it?" said Scrubb: and then, after a pause, "I wish togoodness we'd never come."

"Why on earth?"

"I can't bear it," said Scrubb. "Seeing the King Caspian - a doddering old man like that.

It's - it's frightful."

"Why, what harm does it do you?"

"Oh, you don't understand. Now that I come to think of it, you couldn't. I didn't tell youthat this world has a different time from ours."

"How do you mean?"

"The time you spend here doesn't take up any of our time. Do you see? I mean, howeverlong we spend here, we shall still get back to Experiment House at the moment we left it-"

"That won't be much fun."

"Oh, dry up! Don't keep interrupting. And when you're back in England - in our world -

you can't tell how time is going here. It might be any number of years in Narnia whilewe're having one year at home. The Pevensies explained it all to me, but, like a fool, Iforgot about it. And now apparently it's been about seventy years Narnian years - since Iwas here last. Do you see now? And I come back and find Caspian an old, old man."

"Then the King was an old friend of yours!" said Jill. A horrid thought had struck her.

"I should jolly well think he was," said Scrubb miserably. "About as good a friend as achap could have. And last time he was only a few years older than me. And to see thatold man with a white beard, and to remember Caspian as he was the morning we capturedthe Lone Islands, or in the fight with the Sea Serpent - oh, it's frightful. It's worse thancoming back and finding him dead."

"Oh, shut up," said Jill impatiently. "It's far worse than you think. We've muffed the firstSign." Of course Scrubb did not understand this. Then Jill told him about herconversation with Aslan and the four signs and the task of finding the lost prince whichhad been laid upon them.

"So you see," she wound up, "you did see an old friend, just as Aslan said, and you oughtto have gone and spoken to him at once. And now you haven't, and everything is goingwrong from the very beginning."

"But how was I to know?" said Scrubb.

"If you'd only listened to me when I tried to tell you, we'd be all right," said Jill.

"Yes, and if you hadn't played the fool on the edge of that cliff and jolly nearly murderedme - all right, I said murder, and I'll say it again as often as I like, so keep your hair on -

we'd have come together and both known what to do."

"I suppose he was the first person you saw?" said Jill. "You must have been here hoursbefore me. Are you sure you didn't see anyone else first?"

"I was only here about a minute before you," said Scrubb. "He must have blown youquicker than me. Making up for lost time: the time you lost."

"Don't be a perfect beast, Scrubb," said Jill. "Hallo! What's that?"

It was the castle bell ringing for supper, and thus what looked like turning into a first-ratequarrel was happily cut short. Both had a good appetite by this time.

Supper in the great hall of the castle was the most splendid thing either of them had everseen; for though Eustace had been in that world before, he had spent his whole visit at seaand knew nothing of the glory and courtesy of the Narnians at home in their own land.

The banners hung from the roof, and each course came in with trumpeters andkettledrums. There were soups that would make your mouth water to think of, and thelovely fishes called pavenders, and venison and peacock and pies, and ices and jellies andfruit and nuts, and all manner of wines and fruit drinks. Even Eustace cheered up andadmitted that it was "something like". And when all the serious eating and drinking wasover, a blind poet came forward and struck up the grand old tale of Prince Cor and Aravisand the horse Bree, which is called The Horse and his Boy and tells of an adventure thathappened in Narnia and Calormen and the lands between, in the Golden Age when Peterwas High King in Cair Paravel. (I haven't time to tell it now, though it is well worthhearing.)

When they were dragging themselves upstairs to bed, yawning their heads off, Jill said, "Ibet we sleep well, tonight"; for it had been a full day. Which just shows how little anyoneknows what is going to happen to them next.
