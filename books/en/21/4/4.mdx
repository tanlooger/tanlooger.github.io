title: CHAPTER 4. A PARLIAMENT OF OWLS
---

IT is a very funny thing that the sleepier you are, the longer you take about getting to bed;especially if you are lucky enough to have a fire in your room. Jill felt she couldn't evenstart undressing unless she sat down in front of the fire for a bit first. And once she hadsat down, she didn't want to get up again. She had already said to herself about five times,"I must go to bed", when she was startled by a tap on the window.

She got up, pulled the curtain, and at first saw nothing but darkness. Then she jumpedand started backwards, for something very large had dashed itself against the window,giving a sharp tap on the glass as. it did so. A very unpleasant idea came into her head -

"Suppose they have giant moths in this country! Ugh!" But then the thing came back, andthis time she was almost sure she saw a beak, and that the beak had made that tappingnoise. "It's some huge bird," thought Jill. "Could it be an eagle?" She didn't very muchwant a visit even from an eagle, but she opened the window and looked out. Instantly,with a great whirring noise, the creature alighted on the window-sill and stood therefilling up the whole window, so that Jill had to step back to make room for it. It was theOwl.

"Hush, hush! Tu-whoo, tu-whoo," said the Owl. "Don't make a noise. Now, are you tworeally in earnest about what you've got to do?"

"About the lost Prince, you mean?" said Jill. "Yes, we've got to be." For now sheremembered the Lion's voice and face, which she had nearly forgotten during the feastingand story-telling in the hall.

"Good!" said the Owl. "Then there's no time to waste.

You must get away from here at once. I'll go and wake the other human. Then I'll comeback for you. You'd better change those court clothes and put on something you cantravel in. I'll be back in two twos. Tu-whoo!" And without waiting for an answer, he wasgone.

If Jill had been more used to adventures, she might have doubted the Owl's word, but thisnever occurred to her: and in the exciting idea of a midnight escape she forgot hersleepiness. She changed back into sweater and shorts there was a guide's knife on the beltof the shorts which might come in useful - and added a few of the things that had beenleft in the room for her by the girl with the willowy hair. She chose a short cloak thatcame down to her knees and had a hood ("just the thing, if it rains," she thought), a fewhandkerchiefs and a comb. Then she sat down and waited.

She was getting sleepy again when the Owl returned.

"Now we're ready," it said.

"You'd better lead the way," said Jill. "I don't know all these passages yet."

"Tu-whoo!" said the Owl. "We're not going through the castle. That would never do. Youmust ride on me. We shall fly."

"Oh!" said Jill, and stood with her mouth open, not much liking the idea. "Shan't I be tooheavy for you?"

"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo! Don't you be a fool. I've already carried the other one. Now. Butwe'll put out that lamp first."

As soon as the lamp was out, the bit of the night which you saw through the windowlooked less dark - no longer black, but grey. The Owl stood on the window-sill with hisback to the room and raised his wings. Jill had to climb on to his short fat body and gether knees under the wings and grip tight. The feathers felt beautifully warm and soft butthere was nothing to hold on by. "I wonder how Scrubb liked his ride!" thought Jill. Andjust as she was thinking this, with a horrid plunge they had left the window-sill, and thewings were making a flurry round her ears, and the night air, rather cool and damp, wasflying in her face.

It was much lighter than she expected, and though the sky was overcast, one patch ofwatery silver showed where the moon was hiding above the clouds. The fields beneathher looked grey, and the trees black. There was a certain amount of wind - a hushing,ruffling sort of wind which meant that rain was coming soon.

The Owl wheeled round so that the castle was now ahead of them. Very few of thewindows showed lights. They flew right over it, northwards, crossing the river: the airgrew colder, and Jill thought she could see the white reflection of the Owl in the waterbeneath her. But soon they were on the north bank of the river, flying above woodedcountry.

The Owl snapped at something which Jill couldn't see.

"Oh, don't, please!" said Jill. "Don't jerk like that. You nearly threw me off."

"I beg your pardon," said the Owl. "I was just nabbing a bat. There's nothing sosustaining, in a small way, as a nice plump little bat. Shall I catch you one?"

"No, thanks," said Jill with a shudder.

He was flying a little lower now and a large, black looking object was looming uptowards them. Jill had just time to see that it was a tower - a partly ruinous tower, with alot of ivy on it, she thought - when she found herself ducking to avoid the archway of awindow, as the Owl squeezed with her through the ivied cobwebby opening, out of thefresh, grey night into a dark place inside the top of the tower. It was rather fusty inside

and, the moment she slipped off the Owl's back, she knew (as one usually does somehow)that it was quite crowded And when voices began saying out of the darkness from everydirection "Tuwhoo! Tu-whoo!" she knew it was crowded with owls. She was ratherrelieved when a very different voice said:

"Is that you, Pole?"

"Is that you, Scrubb?" said Jill.

"Now," said Glimfeather, "I think we're all here. Let us hold a parliament of owls."

"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo. True for you. That's the right thing to do," said several voices.

"Half a moment," said Scrubb's voice. "There's something I want to say first."

"Do, do, do," said the owls; and Jill said, "Fire ahead."

"I suppose all you chaps-owls, I mean," said Scrubb, "I suppose you all know that KingCaspian the Tenth, in his young days, sailed to the eastern end of the world. Well, I waswith him on that journey: with him and Reepicheep the Mouse, and the Lord Drinian andall of them. I know it sounds hard to believe, but people don't grow older in our world atthe same speed as they do in yours. And what I want to say is this, that I'm the King'sman; and if this parliament of owls is any sort of plot against the King, I'm havingnothing to do with it."

"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo, we're all the King's owls too," said the owls.

"What's it all about then?" said Scrubb.

"It's only this," said Glimfeather. "That if the Lord Regent, the Dwarf Trumpkin, hearsyou are going to look for the lost Prince, he won't let you start. He'd keep you under lockand key sooner."

"Great Scott!" said Scrubb. "You don't mean that Trumpkin is a traitor? I used to hear alot about him in the old days, at sea. Caspian - the King, I mean - trusted him absolutely."

"Oh no," said a voice. "Trumpkin's no traitor. But more than thirty champions (knights,centaurs, good giants, and all sorts) have at one time or another set out to look for the lostPrince, and none of them have ever come back. And at last the King said he was notgoing to have all the bravest Narnians destroyed in the search for his son. And nownobody is allowed to go."

"But surely he'd let us go," said Scrubb. "When he knew who I was and who had sentme."

("Sent both of us," put in Jill.)

"Yes," said Glimfeather, "I think, very likely, he would. But the King's away. AndTrumpkin will stick to the rules. He's as true as steel, but he's deaf as a post and verypeppery. You could never make him see that this might be the time for making anexception to the rule."

"You might think he'd take some notice of us, because we're owls and everyone knowshow wise owls are," said someone else. "But he's so old now he'd only say, `You're amere chick. I remember you when you were an egg. Don't come trying to teach me, Sir.

Crabs and crumpets!'"

This owl imitated Trumpkin's voice rather well, and there were sounds of owlish laughterall round. The children began to see that the Narnians all felt about Trumpkin as peoplefeel at school about some crusty teacher, whom everyone is a little afraid of and everyonemakes fun of and nobody really dislikes.

"How long is the King going to be away?" asked Scrubb.

"If only we knew!" said Glimfeather. "You see, there has been a rumour lately that Aslanhimself has been seen in the islands - in Terebinthia, I think it was. And the King said hewould make one more attempt before he died to see Aslan face to face again, and ask hisadvice about who is to be King after him. But we're all afraid that, if he doesn't meetAslan in Terebinthia, he'll go on east, to Seven Isles and Lone Islands - and on and on. Henever talks about it, but we all know he has never forgotten that voyage to the world'send. I'm sure in his heart of hearts he wants to go there again."

"Then there's no good waiting for him to come back?" said Jill.

"No, no good," said the Owl. "Oh, what a to-do! If only you two had known and spokento him at once! He'd have arranged everything - probably given you an army to go withyou in search of the Prince."

Jill kept quiet at this and hoped Scrubb would be sporting enough not to tell all the owlswhy this hadn't happened. He was, or very nearly. That is, he only muttered under hisbreath, "Well, it wasn't my fault," before saying out loud:

"Very well. We'll have to manage without it. But there's just one thing more I want toknow. If this owls' parliament, as you call it, is all fair and above board and means nomischief, why does it have to be so jolly secret- meeting in a ruin in dead of night, and allthat?"

"Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!" hooted several owls. "Where should we meet? When wouldanyone meet except at night?"

"You see," explained Glimfeather, "most of the creatures in Narnia have such unnaturalhabits. They do things by day, in broad blazing sunlight (ugh!) when everyone ought to

be asleep. And, as a result, at night they're so blind and stupid that you can't get a wordout of them. So we owls have got into the habit of meeting at sensible hours, on our own,when we want to talk about things."

"I see," said Scrubb. "Well now, let's get on. Tell us all about the lost Prince." Then anold owl, not Glimfeather, related the story.

About ten years ago, it appeared, when Rilian, the son of Caspian, was a very youngknight, he rode with the Queen his mother on a May morning in the north parts of Narnia.

They had many squires and ladies with them and all wore garlands of fresh leaves ontheir heads, and horns at their sides; but they had no hounds with them, for they weremaying, not hunting. In the warm part of the day they came to a pleasant glade where afountain flowed freshly out of the earth, and there they dismounted and ate and drank andwere merry. After a time the Queen felt sleepy, and they spread cloaks for her on thegrassy bank, and Prince Rilian with the rest of the party went a little way from her, thattheir tales and laughter might not wake her. And so, presently, a great serpent came out ofthe thick wood and stung the Queen in her hand. All heard her cry out and rushed towardsher, and Rilian was first at her side. He saw the worm gliding away from her and madeafter it with his sword drawn. It was great, shining, and as green as poison, so that hecould see it well: but it glided away into thick bushes and he could not come at it. So hereturned to his mother, and found them all busy about her.

But they were busy in vain, for at the first glance of her face Rilian knew that no physicin the world would do her good. As long as the life was in her she seemed to be tryinghard to tell him something. But she could not speak clearly and, whatever her messagewas, she died without delivering it. It was then hardly ten minutes since they had firstheard her cry.

They carried the dead Queen back to Cair Paravel, and she was bitterly mourned byRilian and by the King, and by all Narnia. She had been a great lady, wise and graciousand happy, King Caspian's bride whom he had brought home from the eastern end of theworld. And men said that the blood of the stars flowed in her veins. The Prince took hismother's death very hardly, as well he might. After that, he was always riding on thenorthern marches of Narnia, hunting for that venomous worm, to kill it and be avenged.

No one remarked much on this, though the Prince came home from these wanderingslooking tired and distraught. But about a month after the Queen's death, some said theycould see a change in him. There was a look in his eyes as of a man who has seen visions,and though he would be out all day, his horse did not bear the signs of hard riding. Hischief friend among the older courtiers was the Lord Driman, he who had been his father'scaptain on that great voyage to the east parts of the earth.

One evening Drinian said to the Prince, "Your Highness must soon give over seeking theworm. There is no true vengeance on a witless brute as there might be on a man. Youweary yourself in vain." The Prince answered him, "My Lord, I have almost forgotten theworm this seven days." Drinian asked him why, if that were so, he rode so continually inthe northern woods. "My lord," said the Prince, "I have seen there the most beautiful

thing that was ever made." "Fair Prince," said Drinian, "of your courtesy let me ride withyou tomorrow, that I also may see this fair thing." "With a good will," said Rilian.

Then in good time on the next day they saddled their horses and rode a great gallop intothe northern woods and alighted at that same fountain where the Queen got her death.

Drinian thought it strange that the Prince should choose that place of all places, to lingerin. And there they rested till it came to high noon: and at noon Drinian looked up and sawthe most beautiful lady he had ever seen; and she stood at the north side of the fountainand said no word but beckoned to the Prince with her hand as if she bade him come toher. And she was tall and great, shining, and wrapped in a thin garment as green aspoison. And the Prince stared at her like a man out of his wits. But suddenly the lady wasgone, Driman knew not where; and the two returned to Cair Paravel. It stuck in Drinian'smind that this shining green woman was evil.

Drinian doubted very much whether he ought not to tell this adventure to the King, but hehad little wish to be a blab and a tale-bearer and so he held his tongue. But afterwards hewished he had spoken. For next day Prince Rilian rode out alone. That night he came notback, and from that hour no trace of him was ever found in Narnia nor any neighbouringland, and neither his horse nor his hat nor his cloak nor anything else was ever found.

Then Drinian in the bitterness of his heart went to Caspian and said, "Lord King, slay mespeedily as a great traitor: for by my silence I have destroyed your son." And he told himthe story. Then Caspian caught up a battle-axe and rushed upon the Lord Drinian to killhim, and Drinian stood still as a stock for the death blow. But when the axe was raised,Caspian suddenly threw it away and cried out, "I have lost my queen and my son: shall Ilose my friend also?" And he fell upon the Lord Drinian's neck and embraced him andboth wept, and their friendship was not broken.

Such was the story of Rilian. And when it was over, Jill said, "I bet that serpent and thatwoman were the same person."

"True, true, we think the same as you," hooted the owls.

"But we don't think she killed the Prince," said Glimfeather, "because no bones -"

"We know she didn't," said Scrubb. "Aslan told Pole he was still alive somewhere."

"That almost makes it worse," said the oldest owl. "It means she has some use for him,and some deep scheme against Narnia. Long, long ago, at the very beginning, a WhiteWitch came out of the North and bound our land in snow and ice for a hundred years.

And we think this may be some of the same crew."

"Very well, then," said Scrubb. "Pole and I have got to `Find this Prince. Can you helpus?"

"Have you any clue, you two?" asked Glimfeather.

"Yes," said Scrubb. "We know we've got to go north. And w e know we've got to reachthe ruins of a giant city."

At this there was a greater tu-whooing than ever, and noise of birds shifting their feet andruffling their feathers, and then all the owls started speaking at once. They all explainedhow very sorry they were that they themselves could not go with the children on theirsearch for the lost Prince "You'd want to travel by day, and we'd want to travel by night,"they said. "It wouldn't do, wouldn't do." One or two owls added that even here in theruined tower it wasn't nearly so dark as it had been when they began, and that theparliament had been going on quite long enough. In fact, the mere mention of a journeyto the ruined city of giants seemed to have damped the spirits of those birds. ButGlimfeather said:

"If they want to go that way - into Ettinsmoor - we must take them to one of the Marsh-

wiggles. They're the Only people who can help them much."

"'True, true. Do," said the owls.

"Come on, then," said Glimfeather. "I'll take one. Who'll take the other? It must be donetonight."

"I will: as far as the Marsh-wiggles," said another owl.

"Are you ready?" said Glimfeather to Jill.

"I think Pole's asleep," said Scrubb.
