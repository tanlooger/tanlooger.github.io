title: CHAPTER 14. THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD
---

"MY name is Golg," said the gnome. "And I'll tell your Honours all I know. About anhour ago we were all going about our work - her work, I should say - sad and silent, sameas we've done any other day for years and years. Then there came a great crash and bang.

As soon as they heard it, everyone says to himself, I haven't had a song or a dance or letoff a squib for a long time; why's that? And everyone thinks to himself, Why, I must havebeen enchanted. And then everyone says to himself, I'm blessed if I know why I'mcarrying this load, and I'm not going to carry it any farther: that's that. And down we allthrow our sacks and bundles and tools. Then everyone turns and sees the great red glowover yonder. And everyone says to himself, What's that? and everyone answers himselfand says, There's a crack or chasm split open and a nice warm glow coming up through itfrom the Really Deep Land, a thousand fathom under us."

"Great Scott," exclaimed Eustace, "are there other lands still lower down?"

"Oh yes, your Honour," said Golg. "Lovely places; what we call the Land of Bism. Thiscountry where we are now, the Witch's country, is what we call the Shallow Lands. It's agood deal too near the surface to suit us. Ugh! You might almost as well be livingoutside, on the surface itself. You see, we're all poor gnomes from Bism whom the Witchhas called up here by magic to work for her. But we'd forgotten all about it till that crashcame and the spell broke. We didn't know who we were or where we belonged. Wecouldn't do anything, or think anything, except what she put into our heads. And it wasglum and gloomy things she put there all those years. I've nearly forgotten how to make ajoke or dance a jig. But the moment the bang came and the chasm opened and the seabegan rising, it all came back. And of course we all set off as quick as we could to getdown the crack and home to our own place. And you can see them over there all lettingoff rockets and standing on their heads for joy. And I'll be very obliged to your Honoursif you'll soon let me go and join in."

"I think this is simply splendid," said Jill. "I'm so glad we freed the gnomes as well asourselves when we cut off the Witch's head! And I'm so glad they aren't really horrid andgloomy any more than the Prince really was well, what he seemed like."

"That's all very well, Pole," said Puddleglum cautiously. "But those gnomes didn't look tome like chaps who were just running away. It looked more like military formations, ifyou ask me. Do you look me in the face, Mr Golg, and tell me you weren't preparing forbattle?"

"Of course we were, your Honour," said Golg. "You see, we didn't know the Witch wasdead. We thought she'd be watching from the castle. We were trying to slip away withoutbeing seen. And then when you three came out with swords and horses, of courseeveryone says to himself, Here it comes: not knowing that his Honour wasn't on theWitch's side. And we were determined to fight like anything rather than give up the hopeof going back to Bism."

"I'll be sworn 'tis an honest gnome," said the Prince. "Let go of it, friend Puddleglum. Asfor me, good Golg, I have been enchanted like you and your fellows, and have but newlyremembered myself. And now, one question more. Do you know the way to those newdiggings, by which the sorceress meant to lead out an army against Overland?"

"Ee-ee-ee!" squeaked Golg. "Yes, I know that terrible road. I will show you where itbegins. But it is no manner of use your Honour asking me to go with you on it. I'll dierather."

"Why?" asked Eustace anxiously. "What's so dreadful about it?"

"Too near the top, the outside," said Golg, shuddering. "That was the worst thing theWitch did to us. We were going to be led out into the open - on to the outside of theworld. They say there's no roof at all there; only a horrible great emptiness called the sky.

And the diggings have gone so far that a few strokes of the pick would bring you out to it.

I wouldn't dare go near them."

"Hurrah! Now you're talking!" cried Eustace, and Jill said, "But it's not horrid at all upthere. We like it. We live there."

"I know you Overlanders live there," said Golg. "But I thought it was because youcouldn't find your way down inside. You can't really like it - crawling about like flies onthe top of the world!"

"What about showing us the road at once?" said Puddleglum.

"In a good hour," cried the Prince. The whole party set out. The Prince remounted hischarger, Puddleglum climbed up behind Jill, and Golg led the way. As he went, he keptshouting out the good news that the Witch was dead and that the four Overlanders werenot dangerous. And those who heard him shouted it on to others, so that in a few minutesthe whole of Underland was ringing with shouts and cheers, and gnomes by hundreds andthousands, leaping, turning cart-wheels, standing on their heads, playing leap-frog, andletting off huge crackers, came pressing round Coalblack and Snowflake. And the Princehad to tell the story of his own enchantment and deliverance at least ten times.

In this way they came to the edge of the chasm. It was about a thousand feet long andperhaps two hundred wide. They dismounted from their horses and came to the edge, andlooked down into it. A strong heat smote up into their faces, mixed with a smell whichwas quite unlike any they had ever smelled. It was rich, sharp, exciting, and made yousneeze. The depth of the chasm was so bright that at first it dazzled their eyes and theycould see nothing. When they got used to it they thought they could make out a river offire, and, on the banks of that river, what seemed to be fields and groves of anunbearable, hot brilliance - though they were dim compared with the river. There wereblues, reds, greens, and whites all jumbled together: a very good stained-glass windowwith the tropical sun staring straight through it at midday might have something the sameeffect. Down the rugged sides of the chasm, looking black like flies against all that fierylight, hundreds of Earthmen were climbing.

"Your honours," said Golg (and when they turned to look at him they could see nothingbut blackness for a few minutes, their eyes were so dazzled). "Your honours, why don't

you come down to Bism? You'd be happier there than in that cold, unprotected, nakedcountry out on top. Or at least come down for a short visit."

Jill took it for granted that none of the others would listen to such an idea for a moment.

To her horror she heard the Prince saying:

"Truly, friend Golg, I have half a mind to come down with you. For this is a marvellousadventure, and it may be no mortal man has ever looked into Bism before or will everhave the chance again. And I know not how, as the years pass, I shall bear to rememberthat it was once in my power to have probed the uttermost pit of Earth and that I forbore.

But could a man live there? You do not swim in the fire-river itself?"

"Oh no, your Honour. Not we. It's only salamanders live in the fire itself."

"What kind of beast is your salamander?" asked the Prince.

"It is hard to tell their kind, your Honour," said Golg. "For they are too white-hot to lookat. But they are most like small dragons. They speak to us out of the fire. They arewonderfully clever with their tongues: very witty and eloquent."

Jill glanced hastily at Eustace. She had felt sure that he would like the idea of slidingdown that chasm even less than she did. Her heart sank as she saw that his face was quitechanged. He looked much more like the Prince than like the old Scrubb at ExperimentHouse. For all his adventures, and the days when he had sailed with King Caspian, werecoming back to him.

"Your Highness," he said. "If my old friend Reepicheep the Mouse were here, he wouldsay we could not now refuse the adventures of Bism without a great impeachment to ourhonour."

"Down there," said Golg, "I could show you real gold, real silver, real diamonds."

"Bosh!" said Jill rudely. "As if we didn't know that we're below the deepest mines evenhere."

"Yes," said Golg. "I have heard of those little scratches in the crust that you Topdwellerscall mines. But that's where you get dead gold, dead silver, dead gems. Down in Bism wehave them alive and growing. There I'll pick you bunches of rubies that you can eat andsqueeze you a cup full of diamond-juice. You won't care much about fingering the cold,dead treasures of your shallow mines after you have tasted the live ones of Bism."

"My father went to the world's end," said Rilian thoughtfully. "It would be a marvellousthing if his son went to the bottom of the world."

"If your Highness wants to see your father while he's still alive, which I think he'dprefer," said Puddleglum, "it's about time we were getting on to that road to thediggings."

"And I won't go down that hole, whatever anyone says," added Jill.

"Why, if your Honours are really set to go back to Overworld," said Golg, "there is onebit of the road that's rather lower than this. And perhaps, if that flood's still rising -"

"Oh, do, do, do come on!" begged Jill.

"I fear it must be so," said the Prince with a deep sigh. "But I have left half of my heart inthe land of Bism."

"Please!" begged Jill.

"Where is the road?" asked Puddleglum.

"There are lamps all the way," said Golg. "Your Honour can see the beginning of the roadon the far side of the chasm."

"How long will the lamps burn for?" asked Puddleglum.

At that moment a hissing, scorching voice like the voice of Fire itself (they wonderedafterwards if it could have been a salamander's) came whistling up out of the very depthsof Bism.

"Quick! Quick! Quick! To the cliffs, to the cliffs, to the cliffs!" it said. "The rift closes. Itcloses. It closes. Quick! Quick!" And at the same time, with ear-shattering cracks andcreaks, the rocks moved. Already, while they looked, the chasm was narrower. Fromevery side belated gnomes were rushing into it. They would not wait to climb down therocks. They flung themselves headlong and, either because so strong a blast of hot airwas beating up from the bottom, or for some other reason, they could be seen floatingdownwards like leaves. Thicker and thicker they floated, till their blackness almostblotted out the fiery river and the groves of live gems. "Good-bye to your Honours. I'moff," shouted Golg, and dived. Only a few were left to follow him. The chasm was nowno broader than a stream. Now it was narrow as the slit in a pillarbox. Now it was only anintensely bright thread. Then, with a shock like a thousand goods trains crashing into athousand pairs of buffers, the lips of rock closed. The hot, maddening smell vanished.

The travellers were alone in an Underworld which now looked far blacker than before.

Pale, dim, and dreary, the lamps marked the direction of the road.

"Now," said Puddleglum, "it's ten to one we've already stayed too long, but we may aswell make a try. Those lamps will give out in five minutes, I shouldn't wonder."

They urged the horses to a canter and thundered along the dusky road in fine style. Butalmost at once it began going downhill. They would have thought Golg had sent them thewrong way if they had not seen, on the other side of the valley, the lamps going on andupwards as far as the eye could reach. But at the bottom of the valley the lamps shone onmoving water.

"Haste," cried the Prince. They galloped down the slope. It would have been nastyenough at the bottom even five minutes later for the tide was running up the valley like amill-race, and if it had come to swimming, the horses could hardly have won over. But itwas still only a foot or two deep, and though it swished terribly round the horses' legs,they reached the far side in safety.

Then began the slow, weary march uphill with nothing ahead to look at but the palelamps which went up and up as far as the eye could reach. When they looked back theycould see the water spreading. All the hills of Underland were now islands, and it wasonly on those islands that the lamps remained. Every moment some distant lightvanished. Soon there would be total darkness everywhere except on the road they werefollowing; and even on the lower part of it behind them, though no lamps had yet goneout, the lamplight shone on water.

Although they had good reason for hurrying, the horses could not go on for ever withouta rest. They halted: and in silence they could hear the lapping of water.

"I wonder is what's his name - Father Time - flooded out now," said Jill. "And all thosequeer sleeping animals."

"I don't think we're as high as that," said Eustace. "Don't you remember how we had to godownhill to reach the sunless sea? I shouldn't think the water has reached Father Time'scave yet."

"That's as may be," said Puddleglum. "I'm more interested in the lamps on this road.

Look a bit sickly, don't they?"

"They always did," said Jill.

"Aye," said Puddleglum. "But they're greener now."

"You don't mean to say you think they're going out?" cried Eustace.

"Well, however they work, you can't expect them to last for ever, you know," replied theMarsh-wiggle. "But don't let your spirits down, Scrubb. I've got my eye on the water too,and I don't think it's rising so fast as it did."

"Small comfort, friend," said the Prince. "If we cannot find our way out. I cry you mercy,all. I am to blame for my pride and fantasy which delayed us by the mouth of the land ofBism. Now, let us ride on."

During the hour or so that followed Jill sometimes thought that Puddleglum was rightabout the lamps, and sometimes thought it was only her imagination. Meanwhile the landwas changing. The roof of Underland was so near that even by that dull light they couldnow see it quite distinctly. And the great, rugged walls of Underland could be seendrawing closer on each side. The road, in fact, was leading them up into a steep tunnel.

They began to pass picks and shovels and barrows and other signs that the diggers hadrecently been at work. If only one could be sure of getting out, all this was very cheering.

But the thought of going on into a hole that would get narrower and narrower, and harderto turn back in, was very unpleasant.

At last the roof was so low that Puddleglum and the Prince knocked their heads against it.

The party dismounted and led the horses. The road was uneven here and one had to pickone's steps with some care. That was how Jill noticed the growing darkness. There wasno doubt about it now. The faces of the others looked strange and ghastly in the greenglow. Then all at once (she couldn't help it) Jill gave a little scream. One light, the nextone ahead, went out altogether. The one behind them did the same. Then they were inabsolute darkness.

"Courage, friends," came Prince Rilian's voice. "Whether we live or die Aslan will be ourgood lord."

"That's right, Sir," said Puddleglum's voice. "And you must always remember there's onegood thing about being trapped down here: it'll save funeral expenses."

Jill held her tongue. (If you don't want other people to know how frightened you are, thisis always a wise thing to do; it's your voice that gives you away.)

"We might as well go on as stand here," said Eustace; and when she heard the tremble inhis voice, Jill knew how wise she'd been not to trust her own.

Puddleglum and Eustace went first with their arms stretched out in front of them, for fearof blundering into anything; Jill and the Prince followed, leading the horses.

"I say," came Eustace's voice much later, "are my eyes going queer or is there a patch oflight up there?"

Before anyone could answer him, Puddleglum called out: "Stop. I'm up against a deadend. And it's earth, not rock. What were you saying, Scrubb?"

"By the Lion," said the Prince, "Eustace is right. There is a sort of -"

"But it's not daylight," said Jill. "It's only a cold blue sort of light."

"Better than nothing, though," said Eustace. "Can we get up to it?"

"It's not right overhead," said Puddleglum. "It's above us, but it's in this wall that I've runinto. How would it be, Pole, if you got on my shoulders and saw whether you could getup to it?"
