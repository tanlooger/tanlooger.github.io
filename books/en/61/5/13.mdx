title: CHAPTER 13 BIRTH OF THE MODERN WORLD
---






In the past 250 years, the Modern Revolution has transformed the world. Tables 13.1 and 13.2 and figure 13.1 offer some comparisons of industrial output over most of this era. And the first thing they suggest is that global industrial output has increased by almost 100 times. The figures are, of course, very rough-and-ready: the raw statistics are unreliable, as are definitions of “industrial potential,” and not all countries are included. Nevertheless, the general conclusions we can draw from these tables are very clear, and even significant adjustments to the details would not alter them.

On the scales of big history, the large changes shown in these tables may seem both universal and instantaneous. But to understand them properly, we must use a smaller lens and study the form and timing of the transformation in different regions of the world. On timescales of a century or two, the transformation has a clear sequence. And that sequence matters, for it affected the form and impact of the Modern Revolution decisively. Those regions that found themselves at the hub of the new global network of exchanges were the first to experience the high rates of innovation and the extraordinary energy flows characteristic of modernity. By the late nineteenth century, their industrial lead gave them a decisive economic, political, and military advantage, which enabled them to put their stamp on the nature and form of modernity throughout the world.

The transformation first became apparent in western Europe. Within a century, it had revolutionized European rates of growth and European social and political structures. These changes fundamentally altered Europe’s role in the global world system. In 1750, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy accounted for about 11 percent of global industrial production; in 1880, they accounted for almost 42 percent. Today’s “developed world,” as a whole, accounted for about 27 percent of global production in 1750, for 63 percent in 1860, and for almost 94 percent in 1953. The United Kingdom clearly took the leading role during the first century of industrialization. In 1750, the United Kingdom accounted for less than 2 percent of global production; in 1880, more than 20 percent.

The changing balance of industrial power revolutionized the balance of military and political power. By 1800, European powers controlled some 35 percent of the earth’s land area; by 1914, they controlled ca. 84 percent.1 The demographic balance of power was also transformed, though less decisively. The figures in table 11.1 suggest that between 1000 and 1800, Europe’s share of world populations fluctuated between 12 percent and 14 percent (with a temporary increase to 16 percent in the fourteenth century). Then in 1900 it rose to 18 percent before falling to about 9 percent at the end of the twentieth century. These figures underestimate Europe’s demographic significance, as they ignore the millions who left Europe to settle in the neo-Europes of the Americas and Australasia.

For much of the nineteenth century, industrialization appeared to be a European phenomenon. In the twentieth century, however, it showed itself to be global, as production began to rise outside the hub zone of the Atlantic economies. As the populations, the economies, and the military powers of European and Atlantic societies grew, governments in other regions realized that they would have to try to imitate Europe’s economic, political, and military successes. As a result of their efforts and of the increasing economic and cultural integration of the world, European patterns of modernity were imposed on the rest of the world. The speed and scale of these changes closed off the possibility of separate regional industrial revolutions, analogous to the separate regional transformations of the Neolithic era. Instead, European patterns of modernity provided global templates of industrialization, just as the technologies of pioneering agricultural regions provided templates that were copied within the regional exchange networks of the early agrarian era. It is no accident that today businesspeople throughout the world wear suits rather than caftans, or that English has become the universal language of business and diplomacy.

Why did the transformation first become apparent in Europe? Why did the European transformation not fizzle out, as the economic revolution of the Song era had done? In what ways was the trajectory of modernity set during its first century, when it was largely confined to Europe and North America? And what were the main features of these early transformations ? These are the main questions tackled in this chapter.

Because of the significance of the first transitions to modernity, the rest of this chapter will concentrate on the hub regions of western Europe and the North Atlantic. For the sake of clarity it will distinguish three aspects of the modern revolution: economic change, political change, and cultural change. In reality, though, these were facets of a single, complex, and interrelated transformation that occurred with terrifying speed.





ECONOMIC REVOLUTION IN BRITAIN




As economic historians have focused on the details of economic change (historical “pointillism,” as Patrick O’Brien calls it), many have questioned the notion of an “industrial revolution,” just as archaeologists have questioned the idea of a “Neolithic revolution.” Viewed in close-up, the details stand out, not the larger patterns. But from the wide-angle perspective of world history, it is hard to miss the revolutionary nature of the economic changes. In a recent survey, O’Brien writes:



on all the indicators that have since been constructed and reconstructed for the measurement of rates of economic change, when we compare the first half of the nineteenth with the first half of the eighteenth century, the evidence for an intervening period of pronounced discontinuity still seems unmistakable. Nothing like that sustained degree of acceleration had ever occurred either in Britain (or elsewhere in Europe and America). In short, between 1750 and 1850 the long-term rate of growth of the British economy became historically unique and internationally remarkable.2





In discussing the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, I will focus on Britain. This does not mean that Britain was typical: on the contrary, its priority ensured that it was atypical.3 As O’Brien and Caglar Keyder have argued, the French path to modernity, though different from that of Britain, was not by any objective criterion “inferior.” The French peasantry survived longer, and even consolidated its position after the French Revolution; as a result, French agriculture remained more traditional than British agriculture well into the nineteenth century, and its social structures were probably less unequal. Yet the differences between the two countries in long-term rates of growth of output from 1780 to 1914 are not significant.4 Nor, really, are differences in the pace of innovation. Many strategic technological breakthroughs were “Western” rather than British. These include early developments in the design of steam engines; the invention in France of the Jacquard loom, which pioneered the use of digital coding as a form of mechanical control (1801); the invention of the cotton gin in the United States (1793); new bleaching processes, also pioneered in France (1784); the manufacture of porcelain (Meissen, 1708); new techniques in glassmaking and papermaking; and the beginnings of aviation when two papermakers, the Montgolfier brothers, launched the first ever controlled flight, at Antonnay, in southwestern France (1783). Nevertheless, Britain was the region where the economic transformation has been studied most intensively (see table 13.3). It was also the region where the revolutionary nature of these transformations first became apparent to contemporaries. As early as 1837, the French revolutionary Blanqui used the term industrial revolution to suggest that the economic transformations occurring in Britain were quite as revolutionary as the more obvious political and social changes of the French Revolution.5 Thus Britain remains a good vantage point from which to observe the moment of takeoff and to see what it meant at a regional scale.

Unfortunately, Blanqui’s term exaggerates the importance of industrial change. In Britain, changes in methods of industrial production were just one part of a threefold economic revolution. First, the social and political structures within which economic activity took place were transformed with the emergence of a characteristically capitalistic system of social classes and economic exchanges. Second, the agrarian sector was transformed as profit making displaced subsistence as the primary goal of agricultural production, and widespread innovation raised agricultural productivity. Though the technical changes in agriculture were not as startling as those in industry, their real impact was greater, at least before the early nineteenth century. The calculations of N. F. R. Crafts suggest that for most of the eighteenth century, agricultural productivity rose at least as rapidly, and sometimes more rapidly, than industrial productivity.6 Third, new methods of production, based on mechanization and the use of new sources of power (such as coal and steam), revolutionized the scale and productivity of many sectors of British manufacturing—cotton, coal, and iron production in particular. Most of this vast increase in productivity was made possible by technologies that tapped the colossal reserves of ancient solar energy locked up in fossil fuels.

The Social Context




Like many regions of Afro-Eurasia, eighteenth-century Britain was highly commercialized. But in two respects—the structures of government and those of rural society—it was particularly so. Supportive governments and elites help explain why, at least in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, British entrepreneurs were so effective in exploiting new technologies, including those pioneered elsewhere.7

Britain’s strategic position in the global exchange networks of the eighteenth century certainly had something to do with geography, which placed Britain at the epicenter of the new global world system. Its physical location guaranteed that British governments would take exceptional interest in commerce. But as we have already seen, British governments were already preadapted for such a transformation. Britain’s high level of commercialization depended in large part on persistent and aggressive financial and military investments of successive British governments, backed by important sectors of the nobility and merchantry, in protecting British commercial interests overseas.8 The government had good reason to support commercial activity both at home and abroad, because by the eighteenth century, most of its revenues came from customs and excises of various kinds. By creating the Bank of England and supporting expansion overseas, it was protecting its own interests as well as those of a large and influential commercial elite. The contrast with Ming China—whose government despised commerce, depended mainly on noncommercial revenues such as land taxes, and refused to back foreign trade—is striking. But so is the geographical contrast between the two societies: the one now at the center of global exchange networks, the other at the edge of a huge and ancient but subglobal network of exchange.

Commercial activity had also transformed British rural society. Even in Tudor and Stuart England, landless rural laborers may have constituted 25 to 30 percent of the population.9 In the 1640s, an English writer insisted that “the fourth part of the inhabitants of the parishes of England are miserable people, and (harvest time excepted) without any subsistence.” Recent research, based on the pioneering estimates of the English statistician Gregory King, suggests that in 1688, about 43 percent of the population consisted of “cottagers and paupers” or of “laboring people and out servants,” who did not earn enough to fully support themselves.10 Most of these people had no land at all, and those who had land did not have enough for subsistence, making them (in Marx’s terms) proletarians. Many left for the towns, which grew rapidly. By 1700, 10 percent of the population of Great Britain lived in London. Here, living conditions were in many respects worse than in the villages (death rates were notoriously high—42 per 1,000, according to Gregory King), but at least there was a chance of finding work.11

Which were the most important sectors of the British economy in the early eighteenth century? Modern estimates suggest that 37 percent of national income came from agriculture, 20 percent from industry, 16 percent from commerce, and another 20 percent from rents and services, while the government’s income accounted for the remaining 7 percent. In other words, over half of the incomes earned in Britain came from industry, commerce, or rents and services.12 With perhaps half of its population depending mainly on wages rather than subsistence farming, and a national economy in which commercial activities generated well over 50 percent of national income, British society was beginning to conform more closely to the capitalist ideal type than to that of a traditional tributary society. Social structure models of growth predict that innovation should flourish in such an environment; and that is precisely what we see.





Agriculture




Most significant of all was the spread of commercial attitudes and methods in the agricultural sector, the most important sector of most premodern societies. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, capitalistic methods began to transform British farming. This was a fact of fundamental importance, for agriculture remained the engine of the British economy, as it had been in all traditional agrarian civilizations. In the eighteenth century it was still Britain’s largest productive sector, responsible for most of the country’s food, clothing, and raw materials. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the changing social structure of landownership stimulated a technological transformation that, though slow by modern standards, was revolutionary on the scale of world history.

In most agrarian civilizations, the primary function of agriculture was to feed those who worked the land. In Britain, however, over some two centuries, more and more land had been consolidated in the hands of large owners, for whom land was a source of profit rather than subsistence. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of small peasants had been driven from the land or deprived of traditional rights to use pastures, meadows, and woods. Since the sixteenth century, governments had periodically encouraged these changes by allowing enclosures—procedures that allowed landlords to ignore traditional rights to the land—in order to create large, consolidated, and enclosed landholdings. Perhaps half of English land was enclosed before the mid-eighteenth century; in the late eighteenth century, the process was largely completed, mainly through acts of Parliament. The British peasantry vanished as a result, and Britain became the first large-scale society to flourish without a peasant class.

For most rural dwellers, these changes were catastrophic. No longer able to depend on what they produced themselves, rural families found themselves at the mercy of the erratic and unreliable employment market. W. G. Hoskins describes the change in one English village, Wigston Magna in Leicestershire, as agricultural “improvements” brought it money, but not wealth:



The domestic economy of the whole village was radically altered. No longer could the peasant derive the necessaries of life from the materials, the soil, and the resources of his own countryside and his own strong arms. The self-supporting peasant was transformed into a spender of money, for all the things he needed were now in the shops. Money which in the sixteenth century had played merely a marginal, though a necessary, part, now became the one thing necessary for the maintenance of life. Peasant thrift was replaced by commercial thrift. Every hour of work now had a money-value, unemployment became a disaster, for there was no piece of land the wage earner could turn to. His Elizabethan master had needed money intermittently, but he needs it nearly every day, certainly every week of the year.13





For Wigston Magna, the enclosure act of 1765 was a cataclysm. Small owner-occupiers disappeared as a group within about sixty years, becoming rural laborers or framework knitters or paupers.14

As peasant holdings declined, those of their former landlords rose, and so did the average size of farms in general. In the South Midlands, the proportion of farms larger than 100 acres rose from ca. 12 percent in the early seventeenth century to ca. 57 percent two centuries later.15 These figures suggest how quickly the gradient of inequality could steepen during the Modern Revolution. In most agrarian civilizations, a majority of the population had access to farmable land; indeed, low rates of agricultural productivity guaranteed such access, for societies had to allocate most of their labor to the production of food. But now the land was concentrated in the hands of a minority. The changing pattern of ownership revolutionized the economics of agricultural production. Because those who farm on a large scale cannot possibly eat what they produce, they must farm for profit. The increasing size of landholdings therefore offers a good indirect measure of the commercialization of British agriculture.

Commercialization on this scale changed both attitudes toward and methods on the land. To generate profits from enclosed land, landlords had to either produce for the market or put in commercial “farmers”—that is, tenants who would produce for the market and pay rents out of their profits. Both approaches turned agriculture into a business rather than a means of survival. But the second method had the advantage of letting aristocratic landowners keep a polite distance from the crass business of moneymaking, even as they enjoyed their profits. Eric Hobsbawm concludes: “We have no reliable figures, but it is clear that by 1750 the characteristic structure of English landownership was already discernible: a few thousand landowners, leasing out their land to some tens of thousands of tenant farmers, who in turn operated it with the labor of some hundreds of thousands of farm-laborers, servants or dwarf landholders who hired themselves out for much of their time.”16

Changes in the way the land was controlled revolutionized farming techniques. Commercial farmers had to produce for competitive markets, so they had to produce in volume and they had to produce efficiently. But they also had better access than peasant farmers to capital that they could invest in more efficient methods of production. Finally, after enclosure, they normally had access to large blocks of land that enabled them to exploit economies of scale, using modern farming methods that were beyond the means of small producers. To be sure, most of the techniques introduced in the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries were not new; at this stage, efficient implementation of existing techniques counted the most. Indeed, not until the nineteenth century did farm machinery and artificial fertilizers start transforming the technology of modern agriculture. Before then, most of the methods introduced by enterprising farmers had been familiar since the Middle Ages, and many were already in use in different parts of Europe. What was new in Britain was the numbers who embraced these techniques, who had the money to invest in them, and who used them effectively.

British farmers borrowed methods pioneered in the Low Countries since the Middle Ages, often known as “the new husbandry.” These integrated crop and livestock farming in new ways to increase yields and reduce the amount of land left fallow. Many farmers began to plant fallow crops such as clover or turnips. Turnips provided cattle feed and increased livestock numbers, and more livestock provided more manure. Legumes, which are effective fixers of nitrogen, helped regenerate the soil. New crop rotations therefore increased the amount of crops and livestock that could be supported from a given area of land. But there were many other changes—including improved forms of irrigation, land reclamation, and more systematic livestock breeding—all driven by the need for a commercialized agriculture to produce goods in large volume and at low cost.

As these changes were taken up more widely, the productivity of British agriculture rose and the proportion of agricultural workers fell. While the share of employment in agriculture dropped, agriculture’s contribution to national income remained at ca. 37 percent between 1700 and 1800.17 The total output of British agriculture rose about 3.5 times between 1700 and 1850, while the percentage of the male labor force engaged in agriculture fell from 61 percent (in 1700) to ca. 29 percent (in 1840). It has been estimated that by 1840, every male agricultural worker in Britain produced about 17.5 million calories, in comparison with 11.5 in France and even lower figures for most other European countries.18 Table 13.4 shows growth in output of particular crops.

The increasing productivity of British agriculture in the eighteenth century was of profound importance. In the first place, it made possible rapid population growth. Calculations by Crafts suggest that in the eighteenth century, productivity rose just fast enough to support the rapid rates of population growth that Malthus observed; but in the nineteenth century, productivity rose even faster, thereby averting a serious Malthusian crisis of the kind that did strike in many other parts of the world, from Ireland to India and Pakistan and to China.19 In Britain, rising populations enlarged markets for agricultural produce, encouraged further investment, and released more labor for nonagricultural sectors of the economy

Why was so much commercial capital attracted to the land? One answer is that population growth and the decline of subsistence farming increased the internal market for rural produce. Those who had no land had to buy food, however poor they were. So farmers could normally count on expansion in the markets for their produce. These processes created an entirely new type of market—a large market for cheap consumption goods. Such markets could hardly exist to any significant degree in a society of subsistence farmers, a fact that had always limited the scope of and possibilities for commercial farming in the preindustrial world. Cities like Beijing or Baghdad or imperial Rome needed enormous supplies of food; so, too, did many elite households, which demanded luxury as well as subsistence foods. But outside these huge cities, most people ate what they had grown themselves. The appearance of societies in which most people depended entirely on markets for their subsistence was a new phenomenon, and it gave a tremendous stimulus to commercial production of goods of mass consumption.

The change was particularly rapid because in Britain, as in several other European countries, external markets for rural produce were also growing rapidly in the eighteenth century These were mainly colonial markets, protected (sometimes at great cost) by increasingly commercially minded governments. In Britain, colonial expansion and the Navigation Acts of 1651 and 1660 provided a large protected market for British producers. The West Indies were particularly important, as their cash crop economies (concentrating on sugar from the mid–seventeenth century onward) meant that they had to import almost all their food. This was one of the many ways in which Britain’s position at the epicenter of global exchange networks gave a critical extra impetus to commercial activity.





Industry




Given the growing number of landless would-be wage earners, ruling elites increasingly dependent on commercial revenues, a highly commercial agricultural sector, and exceptionally good access to expanding world markets, the surprising thing is how long it took to transform industry as well as agriculture. One reason for the delay is that the levels of investment needed to set up a factory or to buy a steam engine were higher than those needed to “improve” agriculture or innovate in domestic industries. As a result, most industrial production remained traditional in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Britain. Most production still took place in artisan workshops, operating on a scale little different from that of Sumer, 4,000 years before, or exploiting the labor of peasant families who spun or knitted or wove in their own homes. Indeed, for a time the Industrial Revolution gave a new stimulus to small-scale production. A second reason for the delay may be that in a world still dominated by the countryside, demand for industrial goods remained lower than demand for agricultural produce.

Eventually, however, the pursuit of profit began to transform industry as it had agriculture. It is hard to determine exactly when the trickle of innovations characteristic of the premodern world turned into a flood. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, there were innovations in industrial production throughout Europe. But it would be hard to prove that innovation was more rapid in Britain than elsewhere before, perhaps, the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1709, faced with the rising cost of timber (which increased about ten times between 1500 and 1760, while prices in general rose only about five times), Abraham Darby began to experiment with the use of coke in blast furnaces manufacturing iron at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire.20 Such techniques had been used in China in the eleventh century but there is no evidence that the techniques used by Darby borrowed directly or indirectly from Chinese practices.21 Indeed, his methods were not particularly efficient and did not spread widely until improved in the 1760s. But they did cut costs and raise output, as did another change, the invention of the puddling process by Henry Cort, in 1784. All in all, British iron production rose ten times in the eighteenth century.22

Another technique whose full significance became apparent only later was the use of steam power to pump water out of mines. The idea that atmospheric pressure was a potential source of mechanical power had a history going back at least to the sixteenth century, and it may have been familiar in China as well as in Europe.23 A French inventor, Denis Papin, who was well aware of the scientific theory behind the idea of atmospheric pressure, first demonstrated the potential use of steam as a source of mechanical power in 1691. A working steam pump was built by Thomas Savery in 1698; its engine used the vacuum created by condensing steam to suck up water. Thomas Newcomen built an improved version in 1712. Its use was limited because it was inefficient, depending on the repeated heating and cooling of a single cylinder. It also needed vast amounts of coal, so the earliest industrial steam engines were sited at large coal mines, where fuel was abundant and cheap. There they raised productivity, particularly in mines subject to regular flooding. In 1742, in Darby’s ironworks at Coalbrookdale, a steam engine was used for the first time not to pump water but to power the bellows of a blast furnace. By the mid-eighteenth century, enterprises in many parts of Europe and the Americas were using Newcomen engines.

Textile producers also experimented with new techniques to meet increasing demand in what was the second-largest productive sector of most premodern economies. A factory with special Dutch machines for twisting silk, powered by a waterwheel, was set up in Derby as early as 1702. In 1718, a new owner, Thomas Lombe, in an early example of planned industrial espionage, stole techniques already in use in Italy to set up an improved factory. By the 1730s, producers of linen and cotton were trying to construct similar machines, as well as machines to mechanize weaving; these included the flying shuttle, invented in 1733. Government support in the form of bans on imported cotton textiles encouraged innovation from the 1730s on. In the 1770s and 1780s, three new machines began to transform cotton spinning: Richard Arkwright’s water frame, James Hargreaves’s spinning jenny, and Samuel Crompton’s spinning mule, a modification of the jenny.24 They all increased output significantly, but at first they were used mainly in domestic industry. In the two decades after 1780, these and subsequent innovations reduced the price of cotton textiles by 85 percent, making cotton, for the first time in Europe, a mass consumption good rather than an expensive import.25

Arkwright built his first water frame on a large scale and used it in a factory, where it was powered by a waterwheel. His machines did not require factory organization, but factories did give employers greater control over discipline and quality. This is a reminder that the key changes of this period were managerial as well as technological. In the preindustrial world, most nonagricultural production had been organized in households or small workshops. Productive enterprises consisted of small groups of people, sometimes linked by kinship, who worked together, often on similar tasks; and for a time such enterprises may have multiplied as a result of early inventions of the Industrial Revolution, such as the spinning jenny The factory was a much larger and more anonymous production unit, more like an army than a family. And it normally required a more complex division of labor, skills, and authority. The eventual spread of the factory form had something to do with technological change: large prime movers could best be exploited by concentrating the workforce in one place. But the factory form also gave entrepreneurs the sort of power to guide work processes that was necessary to maximize efficiency and cut costs. After all, wage laborers recruited one by one could not be expected to show the solidarity of a family working together in its own household. So the spread of the factory had as much to do with the need to improve work discipline as it did with technology.26 It was a way of controlling both workers and machines. The managerial technologies of the Industrial Revolution also had roots throughout the emerging global world system. The disciplined control of large groups of people had been pioneered in the armies of Europe since the sixteenth century,27 as well as in the slave plantations of the Americas. But other techniques of control, such as using examinations to select personnel, came ultimately from China.

The changes described so far may suggest the strength of the impulse toward innovation in both technique and organization, at least in the crucial sectors of textiles, coal mining, and iron. But as yet, there was little that could not have been paralleled by developments elsewhere in the Afro-Eurasian world system—in China, in India and Pakistan, in the Islamic world, or in other parts of Europe. What revolutionized British industry was the bringing together of steam power, improved machinery, and factory organization.

James Watt made several improvements to the steam engine in the 1760s. First, he separated the condenser from the cylinder, which eliminated a major cause of heat loss and allowed his machine to run on far less fuel. Second, instead of exploiting the atmospheric pressure created by condensing steam to form a semi-vacuum (as did Newcomen’s engine), Watt’s machine used the expansive power of steam directly to drive a piston (see figure 13.2). These and other changes made the steam engine more economical, more powerful, and more adaptable. By the 1790s, spinning wheels were being driven by steam engines rather than people or waterwheels, and productivity soared. By 1800, a power-driven spinning mule could produce as much as 200 or 300 human cotton spinners. The improved steam engine marks the first significant increase in the power available to humans for many millennia. Not since about 6,000 years earlier, when humans had first learned to harness the traction power of other animals, or perhaps 5,000 years earlier, when they had first learned to systematically exploit other human beings on a large scale, had there been such a change in the availability of power sources to produce basic necessities. With the introduction of steam power, then of electricity and oil, human societies began at last to draw on the huge sources of energy locked up in the inorganic world. (The most important earlier example, gunpowder, was mainly used in destructive rather than productive technologies.) Each change opened a new range of ecological niches for human exploitation.

Improved steam engines quickly raised productivity in a few select industries. They also required changes to the way work was organized, for to justify their expense they had to drive a number of machines, which made them incompatible with domestic industry. They worked most effectively in factories, where supervision could be more or less continuous, and human workers became little more than minders of machines—fixing their broken threads, supplying them with raw material, and keeping them running smoothly. As they spread, steam engines became major consumers of coal and metal. Their production thus stimulated mining, iron production, and advances in engineering. Within a few decades, they had also revolutionized methods of land transportation. The idea of using steam to power locomotion had been around for several decades (indeed, a steam cart had been invented in France in the 1760s), but the earliest steam engines were too large. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1802 at Coalbrookdale by Richard Trevithick, who had designed a smaller high-pressure steam engine. The locomotive was initially used as a mechanical horse, to haul coal more quickly. Over the next thirty years, the quality both of the rails and of the engines was improved. The Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first designed to carry passengers as well as coal, opened in 1825.





Figure 13.2. Evolution of the steam engine in eighteenth-century Britain. a. In the Newcomen “atmospheric engine,” which was first used in 1712, steam was pumped into a cylinder, a jet of cold water was sprayed in, and the steam condensed, creating a vacuum that sucked down a piston, which worked the pump. By later standards this was highly inefficient, mainly because the cylinder was alternately heated and cooled. It thus used huge amounts of coal, and was economical only in mines, where coal was plentiful and cheap. b. James Watt patented an improved steam engine in 1769. Among several improvements, he separated the condenser from the cylinder, so that the temperature of the cylinder remained more constant. He also began to use the pressure from the steam, rather than the vacuum created by the steam’s condensation, to drive the piston. The greater fuel efficiency of the Watt engine made it possible to use steam engines away from coal mines. From James E.

The first thing to note as we analyze this series of innovations is that though their impact was fundamental, they were developed incrementally, built on developments and resources drawn from the entire world system. British inventors drew on traditional skills and on knowledge of techniques diffused in a complex network of ideas throughout the global world system. Thomas Lombe’s “silk throwing” machine has a genealogy that may lead back, via Italy, to medieval China. Knowledge of the commercial potential of cotton reflected the importance of Indian textile imports since the seventeenth century, while dyeing techniques owed much to Indian, Persian, and Turkish methods.28 In an essay titled “The Pre-Natal History of the Steam Engine,” Joseph Needham, a historian of Chinese science, argued that its antecedents lay in China and Greece as well as in Europe, and concluded: “No single man was ‘the father of the steam engine’; no single civilization either.”29 The technologies of the first Industrial Revolution were Afro-Eurasian, even global, though their full productivity-raising potential was initially demonstrated in England.

Furthermore, in industry as in farming, the techniques needed in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution depended more on traditional artisans’ skills than on fundamentally new methods or techniques. Many of the pioneers were practical workers rather than scientists or theoreticians. Peter Mathias points out that



by and large, innovations were not the result of the formal application of applied science, nor a product of the formal educational system of the country… . Most innovations were the products of inspired amateurs, or brilliant artisans trained as clock-makers, millwrights, blacksmiths or in the Birmingham trades… . They were mainly local men, empirically trained, with local horizons, often very interested in things scientific, aware men, responding directly to a particular problem. Up to the mid–nineteenth century this tradition was still dominant in British manufacturing industry. It was no accident that the Crystal Palace in 1851, a miracle of cast iron and glass like the great railway stations of the nineteenth century, was the conception of the head gardener of the Duke of Devonshire. He knew about greenhouses.30





This is not to say that the task of inventing and developing new technologies was easy, or that science was irrelevant; but existing technological knowledge had reached a point that made such developments possible.31

The second explanation for this wave of innovation is commercial and social. Placed at a major crossroads of expanding commercial networks by the changing topology of global networks of exchange and the aggressive commercialization of its elites, and controlling huge, protected markets in India and Pakistan and in North America, British entrepreneurs could exploit raw materials such as cotton that were not available in Britain. They could also sell in large protected markets that were developing rapidly enough to absorb the vast increases in output made possible by new machinery But the British internal market was also growing rapidly as Britain’s class structure was revolutionized, with ever larger numbers of people leaving the subsistence economy of the village to become urban wage earners. Rapidly expanding markets within a global world system and a high level of commercial competition stimulated innovation, particularly in the production of goods for the mass market, such as textiles (see table 13.5). Acting on that stimulus were not just well-known inventors but thousands of tinkerers and investors and managers who made a commercial success of the major breakthroughs. The innovations that shaped the British industrial revolution represent the response of a highly commercialized societ to new commercial challenges and opportunities. Eric Hobsbawm summarizes the role played by demand:

Exports, backed by the systematic and aggressive help of government, provided the spark, and—with cotton textiles—the “leading sector” of industry. They also provided major improvements in sea transport. The home market provided the broad base for a generalized industrial economy and (through the process of urbanization) the incentive for major improvements in inland transport, a powerful base for the coal industry and for certain important technological innovations. Government provided systematic support for merchant and manufacturer, and some by no means negligible incentives for technical innovation and the development of capital goods industries.32





However, the fundamental reason for the increased pace of innovation in eighteenth-century Britain and Europe was that there was intense pressure to innovate in a world shaped by the competitive forces of an increasingly global capitalism. The importance of commercial pressures is apparent in the motivations of particular inventors. James Watt, for example, wrote in his autobiography that he was interested in making machines that were “cheap as well as good.”33 Even better evidence is provided by the huge number of innovations in eighteenth-century Europe. And as pressures to innovate increased elsewhere in the course of industrialization, rates of innovation accelerated in all industrializing regions. This suggests that there had emerged in western Europe a culture of innovation—an environment that encouraged entrepreneurs actively to seek out and make effective use of new techniques. Such arguments provide the strongest justification for explanations of the Industrial Revolution that look to both commerce and social structure.





POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN FRANCE




Alongside the economic revolution, there took place a political revolution. Gradually in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and rapidly in the nineteenth century, the power and reach of states grew, and so did the resources available to them. As a result, their relationship to the populations they ruled was transformed. Today’s political systems are to the great tributary empires of the past what those empires were to the chiefdoms and “big man” systems that they had displaced. Charles Tilly amplifies the point:



Over the last thousand years, European states have undergone a peculiar evolution: from wasps to locomotives. Long they concentrated on war, leaving most activities to other organizations, just so long as those organizations yielded tribute at appropriate intervals. Tribute-taking states remained fierce but light in weight by comparison with their bulky successors; they stung, but they didn’t suck dry. As time went on, states—even the capital-intensive varieties—took on activities, powers and commitments whose very support constrained them. These locomotives ran on the rails of sustenance from the civilian population and maintenance by a civilian staff. Off the rails, the warlike engines could not run at all.34





The power of European states had been growing for some centuries, partly as a result of the increased resources available to commercially aggressive states and partly as a response to the fiscal and organizational demands of the gunpowder revolution.35 But these changes, which culminated in the “absolutism” of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were merely playing catch-up. In comparison to the huge imperial states of China or the Islamic world, the European states of 1000 CE were small and fragile affairs. Fierce military competition, heightened by the advent of gunpowder, eventually squeezed out the smaller and less viable states. Those that survived lived through a torrid adolescence during which they learned many of the lessons and gained many of the skills acquired much earlier by the great agrarian empires. Yet even the power and reach of European absolutist states are not particularly striking if they are compared with the Ottoman or Chinese states.

What changed in the period after the French Revolution was the extent to which state power reached directly into the lives of a majority of its subjects. As Tilly points out,



After 1750, in the eras of nationalization and specialization, states began moving aggressively from a nearly universal system of indirect rule to a new system of direct rule: unmediated intervention in the lives of local communities, households, and productive enterprises. As rulers shifted from the hiring of mercenaries to the recruitment of warriors from their own national populations, and as they increased taxation to support the great military forces of eighteenth-century warfare, they bargained out access to communities, households, and enterprises, sweeping away autonomous intermediaries in the process.36





The change can be seen most clearly in revolutionary France, largely because the revolution itself swept away so many of the intermediary authorities that had ruled during the ancien régime. But change was also driven by the need to assemble from scratch powerful new armies. In turn, the conquests of French armies spread the new methods of government (along with the decimal system) to other parts of Europe.

The management of warfare was crucial to these changes. Whereas states in early modern Europe had relied mainly on mercenary armies, from the French Revolution onward, states began to take part directly in recruiting, organizing, and funding national armies. As a result, the organizational and fiscal role of states expanded, and they found they had to start worrying about entirely new problems (such as the health and education of potential recruits).37 All these pressures forced governments to collect more information on the demographic and economic resources they controlled. Later in the nineteenth century, states began to take an interest in public health and to support systems of public education. The political ideologies and the commitment to electoral politics of the French revolutionary governments also forced them to take responsibility for popular welfare and for law and order. The organization of citizens’ armies turned a sense of nationhood into a crucial legitimizing device, encouraging states to become active supporters of nationalist thought and of the historians and writers who constructed nationalist ideologies.

Electoral politics forced states to court ever wider sections of the population, and they did so, at least in part, by presenting themselves as representatives of “the people.” To the surprise of many traditionalists, democratic politics, when handled with care, turned out to strengthen states, not weaken them. Elections also made available to governments new sources of information about shifts in attitudes and demands within the populations they ruled, while they limited the extent to which officials and other intermediaries could filter the information being passed upward to rulers. Whatever their precise form, new methods of information gathering—or “surveillance,” to use Anthony Giddens’s term38—were crucial to the success of rulers in the complex new environments of modern politics.

Policing was a particularly important aspect of these changes, for it was part of the process by which modern states began to create a real monopoly over the means of coercion. In ancien régime France, the state took little interest in police matters, which were usually handled by local authorities; in extreme cases, the army was used. At the end of the 1790s, the French government created for the first time a bureaucratized police organization that assumed a preventive rather than merely a reactive role in dealing with crime and disorder. It was initially headed by the ex-Jacobin Joseph Fouché, now acting as minister of police. As Tilly concludes, “By the time of Fouché, France had become one of the world’s most closely-policed countries.”39

In all these ways, France pioneered what has become the typical modern state: a huge bureaucratic organization with a scale, a power, a wealth, and a reach that would have been inconceivable in the premodern world. This political revolution of modernity is both a cause and a consequence of economic revolution. It is a cause insofar as effective and commercially minded states were necessary if capitalism was to achieve its full dynamism. The steepness of the modern gradient of wealth put far more wealth in the hands of a minority than ever before, and preserving these vast reservoirs of affluence required larger and more elaborate dams than had existed in the agrarian era. States, in short, had to be powerful enough to protect the wealthy and the entrepreneurial. Giddens observes that



private property, as Marx so consistently stressed, has as its other face the dispossession of masses of individuals from control of their means of production… . [T]he “freeing” of wage-labor was undeniably a major aspect of the early establishing of capitalist enterprise on the grand scale. Without the centralization of a coercive apparatus of law, it is doubtful either that this process could have been accomplished, or that the rights of private property as capital could have become firmly embedded.40





The work of defending the emerging gradient of wealth went on in many areas of life. In Britain it encompassed the passing of enclosure acts; the defense of the royal forests (as described vividly by E. P. Thompson); the imprisonment, deportation, or execution of petty thieves; and the protection of entrepreneurial rights against industrial violence (a subject also dealt with brilliantly by Thompson).41 But it took place in many other areas as well. For example, the creation of a modern monetary system was unthinkable without the existence of a powerful state with significant fiscal and managerial resources, as well as effective control over the laws and courts.

On the other hand, the modern state is also a product of the economic transformations of modernity Just as the first states emerged in part in response to the challenges of managing and organizing the huge concentrations of people and resources gathered into the earliest cities, so the modern state was, at least in part, a response to the entirely novel challenges and possibilities created by the abundant wealth generated within industrial economies. The sheer scale of the resources available to modern states would have demanded new managerial methods even without the state’s new need to manage and fine-tune the commercial machinery that generated growth. But modern states also benefited from new technologies, especially in military matters. New forms of communication transformed the movement of troops and supplies, while new methods of manufacture transformed not just the production of weaponry but its nature. The American Civil War was the first truly industrialized war of modern times. At the same time, improved communications and greater literacy enhanced the capacity of states to handle the mass of information needed to rule effectively. And as they became increasingly dependent on the technologies and the huge revenues generated by modern economies, modern states also had to learn how best to encourage growth by adjusting the balance of their interference in and regulation of entrepreneurial activities. As Karl Polanyi argues in a classic study of modernity, the widespread belief that the modern state is less interventionist than premodern states is misleading. For the most part, modern states intervene more widely and more effectively than traditional agrarian states; but they are also more aware of those areas of economic activity where excessive intervention can be counterproductive.42

In the past two centuries there have been many exceptions to these generalizations. Many modern states have never managed to closely regulate the lives of their citizens; others have found it difficult to create the framework for a viable capitalist economy. But for citizens of the many states that have undergone these transformations, the results have been paradoxical. On the one hand, the modern state regulates the lives of its citizens in ways that would have been inconceivable, and might often have seemed inappropriate, in the era of tributary states. It requires that children be taken from parents for compulsory education; it demands detailed information on the lives of individuals, in areas ranging from their incomes to their religious beliefs; it regulates in detail how we may and may not behave. Moreover, these requirements are backed up by formidable police powers. The modern state has taken over many of the educational, economic, and policing functions once handled by households and local communities. In these ways, our lives are more regulated by the state than ever before. Like the nerve centers of multicelled organisms, modern states regulate the lives of individuals because communities of individuals so much larger and more interdependent than in premodern states cannot exist without some degree of central coordination.

On the other hand, the most modern states foster participation in creating and implementing policy through public debate and through elections in which ordinary citizens can stand for office. In these ways, modern states encourage their citizens to see themselves as active agents rather than mere subjects. Modern governments also set clear limits to their own power, because they know the extent to which the wealth they manage depends on avoiding overregulation of entrepreneurial activity. And though they have more force at their disposal than did any premodern states, they normally deploy it with more restraint. In addition, modern states enable many activities that would be impossible without them. They provide infrastructure, protection, and services of many kinds, from education to public health care, and they maintain the legal and administrative framework necessary if modern capitalist economies are to flourish.

While the regulatory powers of the modern state have led some critics to describe it as “totalitarian,” its efforts to include and nurture its citizens explain why so many see it as an ally and a defender of liberty and freedom. Much of modern political life arises from the constant renegotiation of this balance between regulation and support in the activities of the modern state.





CULTURAL REVOLUTION




The movement of ex-peasants into the towns, an increasing concern with technological innovation, government involvement in education, and the spread of new forms of mass media are among the many changes that transformed cultural life.

The most important single change was perhaps the spread of mass education and literacy. Literacy, as we have seen, had emerged first as a way of coping with the large managerial tasks of the earliest states. But for most of the agrarian era, it had remained a privilege of elites, a form of power denied to most of the population. Modern states engaged with their citizens in entirely new ways, which required that the mass of the population itself become involved, albeit perhaps in minor ways, in the huge organizational tasks of modern society. The crucial precondition for popular involvement in productive and managerial tasks was that literacy become general. The effects of this cultural revolution were profound. For example, mass literacy began the process of “disenchanting” the world by undermining the authority of traditional, often semi-magical, forms of thinking. In this way mass education helped spread a different worldview—if not a rigorous understanding of modern science, then at least a certain skepticism about nonscientific maps of reality.

Such developments were accompanied and have been affected by a profound change in the nature of high culture and in attitudes toward knowledge. The usual modern attitude toward knowledge can be characterized as competitive, by analogy with the market. In agrarian civilizations, where most people relied on orally transmitted information, knowledge was largely shaped by the authority of particular teachers. Education consisted of the transmission of traditional skills and a traditional body of knowledge. Where literacy spread, knowledge became more abstract and less personal, and abstract knowledge began to acquire an authority quite independent from the prestige of particular teachers. Furthermore, where societies became more commercialized, habits of testing traditional knowledge became more common, as can be seen in classical Greece, in Abbasid Persia, in Song China, and in early modern Europe. In Europe, methods for the testing of knowledge had their precedents in the dialectical traditions of Socratic philosophy as transmitted through the Islamic world, with its madrassas in which important problems were solved by debate.43 By the Renaissance, thinkers such as Leonardo da Vinci or Christopher Columbus found it natural to hawk their ideas from court to court like intellectual peddlers.44

The emerging market for ideas, in which ideas survived not because of the authority of particular teachers but because they found buyers who had tested their quality, was the proving ground of modern science. Though science’s impact on methods of production was still limited, the scientific style of thinking was already present in a world increasingly dominated by market forces in ideas and politics as well as in trade. As Margaret Jacob has argued, “To an extraordinary extent scientific knowledge had penetrated the thinking of literate Englishmen by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, and … such knowledge contributed directly to the process of industrialization, to creating the world in which we now live.”45 But the market in ideas, like that in goods, was now global; new technologies, such as those of printing, ensured that new ideas would circulate more rapidly as well as more extensively. In the nineteenth century, beginning in Germany, science itself began to be incorporated into entrepreneurial activity as companies set up laboratories specifically to raise productivity and profits. By the late nineteenth century, scientific research was taking a leading role in processes of innovation that might have simply petered out if they had continued to rely on the technical and practical skills of individual entrepreneurs and artisans.

Science’s grip on modern culture may reflect other, subtler changes as well. Wage earners, unlike traditional subsistence peasants, lived in a world in which the dominant forces were not particular overlords or rulers who could be identified, named, and complained about. The modern world is ruled by larger and more impersonal forces, from faceless bureaucracies to abstractions such as “inflation,” or “the rule of law.” Where abstract forces take over the work of coercion from the landlord, the executioner, and the overseer, it is not surprising that there should emerge cosmologies ruled by equally abstract forces. Perhaps the face of God was bound to vanish behind the neutral mask of gravity in a world shaped more by commerce than by coercion.





THE SECOND AND THIRD WAVES




Recent research has stressed the limits of the early Industrial Revolution. In Britain, productivity rose rapidly in agriculture, in cotton, in metallurgy, and in several other branches of manufacturing, but rates of growth for the British economy as a whole were not particularly fast before the 1830s. The first innovations that appeared in British industry affected particular sectors of the economy, but others were little changed before the middle of the nineteenth century (see table 13.5). Despite the rising productivity of British agriculture, the production of food lagged slightly behind population growth until the 1830s.46 And the slowdown in growth in the British economy after the 1870s suggests that on its own, the British industrial revolution could have generated only a limited momentum. If it had occurred, as did the industrial revolution of Song China, at the margins of a regional world system, it would have had a more limited impact and might have fizzled out within a century.

But Britain, unlike Song China, was at the center of the largest and most vigorous exchange networks that had ever existed, and the world as a whole was more unified and commercialized. In addition, the Industrial Revolution proved self-energizing, as inventions in transportation and communications—including the railway, the steamship, the bicycle, the modern printing press, and the telegraph and telephone—accelerated the exchange of information in general and of new technologies in particular. “With improved mobility,” Joel Mokyr notes, “technology itself traveled easier: the minds of emigrants, machinery sold to distant countries, and technical books and journals all embodied the technological information carried from country to country. More mobility also meant more international and interregional competition. Societies that had remained impervious to technological change, from Japan to Turkey, felt left behind and threatened as distance protected them less and less.”47 Improved communications ensured that innovations that cut costs and raised profits would soon be adopted elsewhere within the already commercialized regions of the North Atlantic world. The result was a chain reaction that eventually spread throughout the world, rather than a regional burst of innovation that slowed after a century or two.

Regional patterns of industrialization varied greatly. As Alexander Gerschenkron pointed out in the 1960s, the sequence of change was itself important.48 By the early nineteenth century, many outside observers were becoming aware of the changes occurring in Britain. From that point on, industrialization was bound to be a more conscious process, with greater dependence on deliberate and more or less planned government intervention (a process that was to culminate in the command economies of the twentieth century). It was possible to borrow British technology, and increasingly governments began to promote development. By the end of the nineteenth century, governments and large banks were actively managing industrial change. But differences in existing endowments, social structure, government structures, and geography also counted for much. While industrial production was at the heart of early changes in Britain, Belgium, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, a large, modern industrial sector developed later in France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Nevertheless, rates of economic growth in general were impressive in all these regions in the nineteenth century.

If we focus on the broad picture, we can identify a sequence, a series of “waves” of industrialization, each shaped by different technologies and with different centers of dynamism.49 The first wave, in the late eighteenth century, had little effect outside of Britain. The full impact of steam technology in particular became apparent only in the middle of the nineteenth century, during a second main wave of innovation. Serious industrialization began in Belgium, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States between the 1820s and 1840s. By the 1870s, these areas were creating new industries such as chemical manufacture (in particular for making dyes and producing artificial fertilizers), electricity, and steelmaking, in what Daniel Headrick treats as a third wave of innovation. The Industrial Revolution now spread rapidly throughout the Atlantic economies; indeed, many developments, such as the exploitation of electricity, depended on multiple innovations pioneered in many different parts of this hub region, including Italy, the Balkans, Germany, Scandinavia, France, Britain, and the United States.

German industrialists pioneered the systematic application of science to production, while the United States was at the forefront of the industrialization of agriculture, the mass production of interchangeable components for commodities such as rifles, and, during the Civil War, the industrialization of warfare. By 1900, the United States had overtaken the United Kingdom as a producer of manufactured goods, and Germany was close behind: the United States was responsible for almost 24 percent of world manufacturing output, the United Kingdom for almost 19 percent, and Germany for 13 percent (see table 13.2). Germany and the United States had also pioneered two new, multicellular forms of industrial organization: the national corporation, which vertically integrated tasks previously shared by many separate enterprises, from the production of raw materials to manufacture, wholesaling, and retailing; and the multidivisional corporation, which horizontally integrated what had previously been different sectors of production.50 The second and third waves together created a long boom in production in the late nineteenth century, unmatched until the second half of the twentieth century.

In a great tsunami of change, the second and third waves of industrialization carried the Modern Revolution to the rest of the world, where its impact was largely destructive. Just as the first stage in globalization had destroyed the traditional societies of the Americas, so this new round of global integration ruined traditional political, social, and economic systems beyond the emerging industrial heartlands of the Atlantic seaboard. As productivity rose in the industrialized hub region and the prices of goods such as British machine-made textiles fell, producers in other regions found their livelihood undermined by European imports. In entering global markets, small producers found themselves competing with large corporations using the most up-to-date technologies, and in the long run there was no doubt as to who would lose that competition. Wherever they had the power to do so, as in India and Pakistan, European powers accelerated such processes by juggling with tariff barriers or by forcing weaker powers and colonies to accept European exports. In this project, the power of newly industrialized armies, with modern, mass-produced weapons, and of better transportation systems such as steamships and railways could prove decisive—so decisive that Europe was able to import Indian grain even during the subcontinent’s horrifying famines of the late nineteenth century.51 Even China’s once self-sufficient economy buckled as the increasing gravitational pull of the Atlantic economies warped the topology of international trade. Britain forced China to accept European exports, beginning with opium, after the First Opium War of 1842, when British forces threatened to cut the canal routes that supplied the north with grain. Over the next sixty years, industrialized European powers began to take economic and political control of China, as Britain had already taken control of the huge economy of Mogul India. In the final two decades of the century, European states imposed direct imperial control over much of Africa in the last great wave of political imperialism. Europe’s economic and political colonies saw nineteenth-century capitalism in its most predatory forms.

The transformations of the late nineteenth century created a world divided between those that did and those that did not have industrial economies. The same processes that enriched the societies of the Atlantic seaboard ruined much of the rest of the world; and the gradients of inequality within nations, which had widened so spectacularly with the decline of the traditional peasantry, now became gradients between regions and nations. As the balance of economic and military power shifted, China’s share of world industrial production fell from 33 percent in 1800 to 6 percent in 1900 and 2 percent in 1950; that of India and Pakistan fell from 20 percent in 1800 to less than 2 percent in 1900. The twentieth-century term the third world could have made no sense in 1750, when today’s third world countries accounted for almost 75 percent of global industrial production. By the late twentieth century, they counted for less than 15 percent. Third world industrial production crashed in the second half of the nineteenth century, with total production falling to 37 percent in 1860, to 21 percent in 1880, and to about 7 percent for much of the first half of the twentieth century (see table 13.2 and figure 13.3).

The gap between “first” and “third” worlds, which was so familiar a part of the international landscape in the twentieth century, first appeared in the late nineteenth century. As Mike Davis writes:



When the Bastille was being stormed, the vertical class divisions inside the world’s major societies were not recapitulated as dramatic income differences between societies. The differences in living standards, say, between a French sans-culotte and Deccan farmer were relatively insignificant compared to the gulf that separated both from their ruling classes. By the end of Victoria’s reign, however, the inequality of nations was as profound as the inequality of classes. Humanity had been irrevocably divided. And the famed “prisoners of starvation,” whom the Internationale urges to arise, were as much modern inventions of the late Victorian world as electric lights, Maxim guns and “scientific” racism.52





Figure 13.3. The “rise of the West”: the industrial potential of China and the United Kingdom/United States, 1750–1980, as a percentage of the global total. Based on table 13.2.



The famines of the late 1870s, which touched equatorial and subequatorial regions right around the globe, were a watershed event in the history of the modern world, for the disruptive economic and social effects of European imperialism magnified the impact of a traditional, El Niño–related drought and thereby caused some of the worst famines since the fifteenth century.53 Even worse was to come in the next twenty-five years, as the embryonic third world was integrated more tightly into global transportation networks, within which famines and epidemic diseases spread more widely and more rapidly than ever before. Many more people died in these crises than were to die during the First World War.

As traditional rulers outside the industrializing core became aware of their vulnerability, they began to wonder if they would have to industrialize the lands they ruled. But how? The conclusions reached in the previous chapter suggest that the problems they faced were as much political and cultural as economic. Matching the rates of innovation of the North Atlantic hub region meant changing political systems and cultural attitudes as well as economic structures in order to create well-integrated capitalist societies. This was bound to be a delicate and painful political maneuver—particularly for more traditional governments such as that of Tsarist Russia, which maintained many of the anticommercial attitudes of traditional tributary empires. Eventually, traditional governments would have to compromise with the new world of industry; but whatever form these compromises took, they were bound to threaten the established support base of these governments and undermine their stability. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, two highly traditional governments, whose societies were already moderately commercialized, presided over state-led industrialization drives. While the Meiji government in Japan rode the rapids of industrialization with considerable success, the Tsarist government did not; and it was left to the Communist government of Stalin to attempt the paradoxical project of an industrialization drive undertaken in the absence of entrepreneurs. Though the Stalinist industrialization drive had remarkable early successes, its eventual failure illustrates the difficulty of sustaining innovation without a competitive market environment.54 Other once powerful regions—including the Islamic world, India and Pakistan, and China—underwent halfhearted attempts at reform, which left them in increasing economic and sometimes military dependence on Europe.





SUMMARY




The threshold to modernity was first crossed in the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries, in western Europe. The change had three interlinked aspects: economic, political, and cultural. The Industrial Revolution (the label applied to the economic aspects of the change) has been best studied in England, the country in which the changes first became apparent. England’s social structures already conformed closely to the model of a capitalist society in the eighteenth century, with a rapidly growing class of wage earners and with governments closely allied to mercantile interests. The innovative potential of British capitalism first became apparent in agriculture, where commercially minded landowners raised agricultural productivity by introducing improvements on a large scale. Industrial breakthroughs came later; the crucial innovation was the use of steam power in large factories, which provided access to the energy bonanza of fossil fuels. Growing wealth, and the need to manage market economies and protect new forms of wealth, posed new challenges for governments, which had to begin mobilizing both resources and political support in new ways. These changes can be seen most clearly in the revolutionary changes that transformed government in France from the late eighteenth century on. For the first time, government began to reach into the daily lives of a majority of its subjects, concerning itself with their education, health, and attitudes. The most fundamental cultural change of the period was probably the increasing importance of scientific approaches to the world. Though scientific attitudes did not affect a wider population until their spread by mass education in the twentieth century, they played an important role in the technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution. The impact of science gained increasing significance during the nineteenth century’s second and third waves of innovation. The Industrial Revolution then spread to western Europe and North America, as rates of innovation slowed in Britain. Beyond the industrializing core, the early stages of the Modern Revolution were largely destructive. In the late nineteenth century, differentials in wealth between different parts of the world became, for the first time, as great as the differentials within nations, and traditional structures that had worked, after a fashion, for millennia broke down, failing those who still depended on them for survival.
