[T]he Aborigines of Arnhem Land called the first Europeans they saw Balanda, a Bahasa Indonesia term for Europeans which is derived from “Hollander,” as the Dutch were once known.





This chapter will survey world history in the period from 1000 CE to ca. 1700 CE, setting forth some of the changes that prepared the way for the Modern Revolution. It will concentrate first on global processes, showing how expansion in the size of exchange networks, slow before the sixteenth century and then much faster, created new possibilities both for the exchange of information and goods and for innovation. It will argue that the creation of a truly global exchange network in the sixteenth century decisively increased the scale, significance, and variety of informational and commercial exchanges. The coming together of the different world zones of the Holocene era marks a revolutionary moment in the history of humanity.

Second, this chapter will describe the changing topology of global exchanges. As the geography of exchange networks was transformed, flows of information and wealth entered new channels. These effects were particularly significant in western Europe, which had previously been at the margin of exchanges within the Afro-Eurasian world zone but now suddenly found itself at the hub of humanity’s first global system of exchanges. These changes in the scale and geography of exchange networks laid the intellectual and commercial foundations for the Modern Revolution, and determined its geography.

It may be helpful to think of three distinct scales of explanation. First, in one sense the Modern Revolution was and is a global process; it cannot be properly understood without appreciating this feature. Its intellectual, material, and commercial raw materials came from all parts of the world. And the new level of creative synergy generated by linking the two largest world zones—Afro-Eurasia and the Americas—was and remains perhaps the most powerful single lever of change in the modern world. The Modern Revolution was also global in its effects, both creative and destructive. In some form, its impact was felt very soon in all parts of the world.

But in different world zones modernity was experienced in different ways, and the need to understand the diversity of its impacts requires a second level of explanation. The coming together of the different world zones proved a brutal and destructive process for indigenous populations (both human and nonhuman) in all three of the smaller world zones: the Americas, Australia, and the Pacific. The advantages accumulated disproportionately within parts of the Afro-Eurasian zone—and later in the “neo-Europes” of the Americas, Australia, and the Pacific, the new societies created by peoples from Afro-Eurasia after migrating (willingly or unwillingly) to the other three world zones. In some sense, the history of the Afro-Eurasian zone ensured that when its peoples encountered societies from the other world zones, the Afro-Eurasian societies prevailed.

We have already seen some of the reasons for this dominance. Some have to do with the existence of domestic livestock in Afro-Eurasia. Used for transportation and haulage, domestic livestock magnified the advantages of scale by extending and quickening processes of exchange within what was already the largest and most varied of the world zones. Extensive and vigorous exchange networks help explain some of the technological advantages enjoyed by Afro-Eurasian societies. But animal domesticates also swapped diseases with their human owners; thus cohabitation with domesticates, combined with the efficient systems of communication they provided, ensured that the populations of Afro-Eurasia were more disease-hardened than those of the other world zones.1 And the diseases of Afro-Eurasians may have been more useful to them in their attempts at conquest than their advanced naval and military technologies. For example, smallpox, as Alfred Crosby writes, “played as essential a role in the advance of white imperialism overseas as gunpowder—perhaps a more important role, because the indigenes did turn the musket and then rifle against the intruders, but smallpox very rarely fought on the side of the indigenes.”2

But even within the huge Afro-Eurasian world zone, the advantages of the Modern Revolution accumulated erratically and lopsidedly, an observation that brings us to the third or regional scale. If we think of the Modern Revolution as a product of the new intellectual and commercial synergies of the first global system, it initially seems natural that the intellectual and commercial raw materials for modernity should have accumulated preferentially within established hubs of exchange and centers of gravity, perhaps in the Mediterranean world, or Mesopotamia, or northern India, or China. And indeed perhaps something like this did happen. Rates of growth, and even of innovation, were high and sustained in all of these regions throughout the period covered by this chapter.3 But although all the old core regions were shaped by the emerging global network of exchange, the full power and significance of the Modern Revolution emerged elsewhere. The sharp rise in innovation that signifies modernity first became apparent at the western edge of the Afro-Eurasian world zone, in a region that had not been incorporated within the expanding zone of agrarian civilizations until the first millennium CE and had seemed of secondary importance before the middle of the second millennium. That the adaptive significance of the Modern Revolution would first become apparent here was not obvious even as late as 1776, when Adam Smith remarked that “China is a much richer country than any part of Europe.”4

An adequate explanation of the Modern Revolution must attempt to explain its origins at all these different scales. As the Islamicist Marshall Hodgson put it in an essay first published in 1967:



just as civilization on an agrarianate level had appeared in one or at most a very few spots and spread from there to the greater part of the globe, so the new modern type of life did not appear everywhere among all citied peoples at the same moment, but first in one restricted area, Western Europe, from which it has spread everywhere else. It was not that the new ways resulted from conditions that were limited entirely to the Occident. Just as the first urban, literate life would have been impossible without the accumulation among a great many peoples of innumerable social habits and inventions, major and minor, so the great modern cultural mutation presupposed the contributions of all the several citied peoples of the eastern hemisphere. Not only were the numerous inventions and discoveries of many peoples necessary—for most of the earlier basic ones were not made in Europe. It was also necessary that there exist large areas of relatively dense, urban-dominated populations, tied together in a great interregional commercial network, to form the vast world market which had gradually come into being in the eastern hemisphere, and in which European fortunes could be made and European imaginations exercised.5





Today, more than thirty-five years after Hodgson wrote, it is even easier to see the extent to which the Modern Revolution was a product of global processes, even if its full significance first became apparent at the western edge of the Afro-Eurasian world zone.

We have seen in earlier chapters that at large scales, the size, variety, and intensity of exchange networks could be important determinants of rates of innovation, while at slightly smaller scales, population growth, state activity, and commercial expansion were also significant. All of these factors were influenced considerably by the Malthusian cycles that characterized the history of most agrarian civilizations. Networks of commercial, political, and information exchanges expanded most vigorously during eras of demographic expansion; they often contracted in periods of demographic decline. And during the phases of expansion, the increased scope of exchanges, population growth, state activity, and commercial activity all tended to generate innovations. In the millennium preceding the Industrial Revolution, two large Malthusian cycles were crucial in shaping the history of the entire Afro-Eurasian world zone and, indirectly, that of other zones as well (see figure 10.4). The first cycle began with a demographic revival in the second half of the first millennium and ended abruptly with the Black Death in the middle of the fourteenth century. The second, which began after the Black Death, ended in a less drastic slowdown during the seventeenth century.





THE POSTCLASSICAL MALTHUSIAN CYCLE: BEFORE THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY





The Expansion Phase




Malthusian cycles are easiest to see in the rhythms of population growth (see table 11.1 and figure 10.4). In all Malthusian cycles, it is possible to identify some significant innovations that enabled populations to grow to a new level. The postclassical cycle was linked partly to developments in agricultural technologies, such as the introduction of heavier, horse-drawn plows in Europe, or the introduction of new crops such as rye or new strains of rice (encouraged by government activity, though the strains of rice were improved by peasant farmers) and better-managed systems of irrigation. In China, northern Europe, and the Islamic world, agricultural methods were revolutionized between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. Everywhere, population growth stimulated colonization. Indeed, growth was most rapid in those lands, such as central Asia, northern and eastern Europe, and South China, that had been frontier zones in the classical era. In China, 60 percent of the population lived in the northern lands, dominated by the Yellow River; 250 years later, only 40 percent lived there, and South China had become the demographic heartland of the Chinese Empire.6

Far to the west, in the borderlands we now call Europe, internal colonization shifted the demographic center of gravity northward as lands once regarded as wastelands began to be farmed. In England, moorlands, woodlands, and marshlands were brought into cultivation in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Asa Briggs notes, “The ‘wastes’ of Dartmoor, for example, were cultivated; terraced hillsides … were farmed at Mere in Wiltshire and in Dorset; the monks of Battle Abbey in Sussex constructed successive seawalls to reclaim the marshes. By the late thirteenth century a bigger area was cultivated than at any period before the wars of the twentieth century.”7 Along the northwestern shores of Europe, colonists and their landlords from the Rhine to the Loire reclaimed land from coastal swamps and marshes, beginning a process that evolved in the Netherlands into a great national art. In eastern Europe, a massive and largely unrecorded peasant migration from the sixth century onward created the demographic foundations for the first great Russian states.

Population growth stimulated urbanization. In Europe and Russia, the number of cities with populations exceeding 20,000 rose from 43 to 103 between 1000 and 1300.8 Cities flourished particularly in the Islamic world. In the ninth century, the Abbasid capital, Baghdad, may have had a population of half a million. But even at the edge of the Islamic world, in Khorezm on the Aral Sea, towns prospered at the hub of trade routes linking the woodlands of Siberia, the steppes, and the urbanized lands of the south. Khorezm displays the mix of high culture and squalor characteristic of most premodern cities. The Arabic geographer al-Muqaddasi wrote that its capital, Kath, had a superb mosque and a royal palace, and its muezzins were renowned throughout the Abbasid domains for “beauty of voice, expressiveness in recitation, deportment, and learning.” Yet “the town is constantly flooded by the river, and the inhabitants are moving (farther and farther) away from the bank. The town … contains many refuse drains, which everywhere overflow the high road. The inhabitants use the streets as latrines, and collect the filth in pits, whence it is subsequently carried out to the fields in sacks. On account of the enormous quantity of filth strangers can walk about the town only by daylight.”9

Cities also flourished in China, particularly in the more commercialized south. By the twelfth century, China may have been “the most urbanized society in the world,” with levels of urbanization perhaps as high as 10 percent.10 Hangzhou (Marco Polo’s “Kinsai,” the capital of the southern Song) was then possibly the world’s largest city, with at least a million inhabitants. It contained many different neighborhoods: working-class suburbs with crowded multistory houses; foreign quarters with Christians, Jews, and Turks; a large Muslim quarter with many foreign traders; and a wealthy southern region dominated by government officials and rich merchants.11 Some idea of the variety of trades conducted in the town is conveyed by the historian Jacques Gernet’s list of the guilds of Hangzhou. These included, in the words of Janet Abu-Lughod, “jewellers, gilders, gluemakers, art and antique dealers, sellers of crabs, olives, honey, or ginger, doctors, soothsayers, scavengers, bootmakers, bath keepers, and … money-changers[.]”12 In this period, the largest cities in the world could be found in China.13

Urbanization stimulated commerce, both local and international. A whole hierarchy of markets appeared. At the lowest levels, markets were still dominated by barter, as a twelfth-century Chinese description suggests:



The small market—



People with their bundles of tea or salt,



Chickens cackling, dogs barking,



Firewood being exchanged for rice



Fishes being bartered for wine.



Here and there—



Green tavern flags



Where elderly gentlemen sit propped,



Drowsy with drink.14





But regional and international markets flourished as well. In northwestern Europe, in 1000 CE, most people were still self-sufficient peasants; farther south, too, most production was rural, even in old urban regions such as northern Italy. But early in the second millennium, as populations and cities grew, so did networks of trade and commerce. The famous fairs of the Champagne region linked Flanders to the ancient trade networks of Italy and the Mediterranean. In Europe, the expansion of trade and of cities was so spectacular that one historian, Robert Lopez, has called the “commercial revolution of the Middle Ages” a fundamental turning point in modern world history. For another historian, Carlo Cipolla, “the rise of the cities in Europe in the tenth and twelfth centuries marked a turning point in the history of the West—and, for that matter, of the whole world.”15 Such comments convey the pace of change in Europe, though they underestimate the extent and significance of changes elsewhere in Afro-Eurasia.

That commercialization was significant throughout the Afro-Eurasian zone is shown by the consolidation and intensification of a thriving interregional trading system. The thirteenth-century world system, described so well in an influential study by Janet Abu-Lughod, linked China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Islamic world, central Asia, parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, and Europe into a single commercial network that carried much more traffic than the networks of the classical era.16 As Thomas Allsen has shown, significant amounts of political, cultural, and technological information flowed through these networks, as well as trade goods and diseases.17 Pastoralists played crucial roles in this system as protectors, as guides, and sometimes as traders. The extent of these Islamic-dominated networks of commerce and culture is vividly illustrated in the memoirs of Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan scholar who visited most parts of them as he traveled from Morocco to Mecca, to the Eurasian steppes, to India, to China, and across the Sahara between 1325 and 1355.18 Under the Mongols, trans-European trade networks were even more vital, for the Mongols actively protected trade in the lands they ruled. While these land networks stimulated exchanges of many different kinds throughout Eurasian trading networks, sea routes may have been still more important—particularly those linking China, India, and the Islamic world. It was an early sign of the commercial precocity of Europe that its traders played an active role in many of these systems. By the tenth century, Viking traders and settlers could be found from Greenland (even briefly from Newfoundland) to Baghdad and central Asia. Early in the fourteenth century, Italian merchants (following in the footsteps of Marco Polo) traveled so regularly between the Mediterranean and China that guidebooks were published to help them on their way. But they were not alone. Armenian and Jewish merchants played crucial roles in trans-Eurasian exchanges.19 Religions, including Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Islam, also moved surprisingly freely along the major Afro-Eurasian trade networks. And so did diseases. Eventually, traveling from east to west, came the bubonic plague. Its spread indicated the scale and intensity of Afro-Eurasian exchange networks, even though it was to end the postclassical cycle of expansion.

The hub of these networks remained in the Islamic world, so it is not surprising that Islam expanded throughout this period. In the centuries before 1000 CE, the importance of the Mesopotamian/Persian hub region was apparent in the critical role of the Sassanid and Islamic Empires in Afro-Eurasian exchange networks. In the first thousand years of their history, the Islamic civilizations that controlled this zone encouraged exchanges of ideas, goods, and technologies between many different parts of Afro-Eurasian networks, thereby stimulating population growth and increasing the synergy of commercial and information networks. As Andrew Watson has shown, the expansion of Islam was sustained in part by the openness of early Islamic states to innovation, particularly in agriculture.20 In the course of several centuries, agriculturalists in the Islamic world imported and learned to use a wide range of new crops—including fruit trees, vegetables, and cereals, as well as fiber crops, condiments, and narcotics—in what we might call the Abbasid exchange, by analogy with the later Columbian exchange. Many new crops came from India, Africa, or Southeast Asia. And because information was pooled in the Islamic world as well as crops and technologies, it became the center of Eurasian science as well as commerce. It was here, not in Europe, that the greatest achievements of classical Mediterranean philosophy and science were preserved for the future. In 1000 CE, there could be little doubt that the hub of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene lay in the Islamic world, and the expansion of Islam continued throughout the postclassical Malthusian cycle. By 1500, Islamic states included the Ottoman Empire, the most powerful empire in the Mediterranean world; the Safavid Empire in Persia; and a series of states reaching from the Philippines through Southeast and South Asia to sub-Saharan Africa.

But though the hub of Afro-Eurasian exchange networks was in Southwest Asia, their center of gravity lay in India and China. While the exchanges that passed through the eastern Mediterranean may have been more diverse and drawn from a larger area, the greatest volume of exchanges could be found in East Asia. European merchants were drawn to Asia, and particularly to China, because that was where the largest markets could be found, sustained by the largest populations and the most dynamic economies in the world. East Asian economic history has not been studied as intensely as that of Europe; and ever since the eighteenth century, models of Asian economic history have been shaped too much by images of a fundamentally static “Asiatic” type of economy and society. The reality was different.21 Not only were Asian economies the largest in the world, they may also have had the highest levels of commercialization, at all levels of society, and the highest levels of productivity, both in the countryside and the towns.

Indeed, as noted in chapter 10, Lynda Shaffer has argued that the main geographical feature of this era of world history was “Southernization.”22 Akin to the more recent phenomenon of Westernization, Southernization began, she suggests, with technological and commercial innovations in textile production, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, and navigation, all pioneered in the Indian subcontinent and in Southeast Asia. In the ninth century CE, a Muslim writer, al Jahiz, wrote:



As regards the Indians, they are among the leaders in astronomy, mathematics … and medicine; they alone possess the secrets of the latter, and use them to practice some remarkable forms of treatment. They have the art of carving statues and painted figures. They possess the game of chess, which is the noblest of games and requires more judgment and intelligence than any other. They make Kedah swords, and excel in their use. They have splendid music… . They possess a script capable of expressing the sounds of all languages, as well as many numerals. They have a great deal of poetry, many long treatises, and a deep understanding of philosophy and letters… . Their sound judgment and sensible habits led them to invent pins, cork, toothpicks, the drape of clothes and the dyeing of hair… . They were the originators of the science of firk, by which a poison can be counteracted after it has been used, and of astronomical reckoning, subsequently adopted by the rest of the world. When Adam descended from Paradise, it was to their land that he made his way.23





Innovations pioneered or preserved in the Indian subcontinent spread to Southeast Asia and China and then to the Islamic world, providing much of the driving force for the postclassical Malthusian cycle. Shaffer notes, “By 1200 the process of southernization had created a prosperous South from China to the Muslim Mediterranean.”24





Commercialization and Its Impact




The expansion of Afro-Eurasian markets during the postclassical Malthusian cycle ensured that commerce and those engaged in it acquired a cultural, economic, and political importance they had never enjoyed before. We have seen that merchants had played a significant role in all agrarian civilizations, but usually they constituted a subordinate and sometimes despised layer of the upper classes. However, as trade networks expanded within agrarian civilizations over several millennia, so did the volume of wealth passing through mercantile hands, and so did the number and importance of those who managed or depended on commercial wealth. By the end of the postclassical Malthusian cycle, merchants formed an important, wealthy, and distinctive social category in most states in the Mediterranean and Islamic worlds, the Indian subcontinent, and China. In some regions and countries, such as the city-states of Italy or the Netherlands or Southeast Asia, merchants dominated small states.

In such states, increased reliance on commercial revenues led to fundamental changes in attitudes, in state structures, and in policy. We have already seen that those polities near major trading systems often had to depend more on commercial than on tributary revenues. In Europe, small states multiplied during the postclassical Malthusian cycle, because here (unlike in the eastern Mediterranean, northern India, and China) no large tributary empire emerged to succeed the imperial juggernauts of the classical era. Thus Europe, like parts of South and Southeast Asia, developed as a region of many small and highly competitive states. Their size limited the volume of tributary revenues that could be exacted; intense competition raised the cost of survival; and the proximity of major trade routes provided opportunities to siphon off commercial revenues. In such environments, commercial sources of revenue ceased to be an embarrassing expedient: they not only provided fiscal salvation for many small states but also shaped their economic and political structures, and even their values and social composition.

Clusters of aggressively commercial city-states appeared in Italy and also in northwestern Europe—particularly in Flanders and in the many cities of the Hanseatic League, which traded in the furs and fish of the Atlantic and the Baltic. Because these states were so dependent on trade, their rulers were often closely allied to merchants; sometimes the rulers were merchants. Not surprisingly, such states backed mercantile activity with all the political and military force at their disposal, engaging in a confusing mix of tributary and commercial exchanges, using force where they could, but trading with commercial finesse where necessary. In Italy, Thomas Brady observes, “States ruled by merchants or by merchants and landowners arose … very shortly after A.D. 1000. Pisa, Genoa, and Venice led the pack, but all up and down Central Europe, from Tuscany to Flanders, from Brabant to Livonia, merchants not only supplied warriors—as they did all over Europe—they sat in governments that made war and, sometimes, buckled on armor and went into battle themselves.”25 On occasion, these trading polities proved powerful enough to inflict military defeats even on powerful tributary polities, as the Athenian city-states had 1,500 years before, when they defeated the Persian Empire at Marathon and Salamis (in 490 and 480 BCE, respectively). In 1176, at the battle of Legnano, a league of northern Italian communes defeated the German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, and freed themselves from imperial control. An uncle of Barbarossa’s noted the oddity of this phenomenon: “In the Italian communes they do not disdain to grant the girdle of knighthood or honorable positions to young people of inferior station, and even to workers of the vile mechanical arts, whom other peoples bar like the plague from the more respectable and honorable circles.”26

Militarily powerful commercial states such as these reflect the long-term rule that as commercial networks expanded and the wealth passing through them increased, so too did the potential influence of mercantile elites, until they sometimes found that they could challenge neighboring tributary elites not just commercially but in war as well. One of the decisive markers of the Modern Revolution was to be the rising economic and military influence of states whose economies were based on commercial exchanges rather than on more traditional tributary activities such as the gathering of taxes from the land. But not until the nineteenth century did it become apparent that as more and more wealth circulated within international commercial networks, such states would eventually eclipse even the most powerful of tributary empires, and on their home ground—the use of military force.





An Aborted Industrial Revolution in Song China?




China offers an interesting example of the potential impact of commercialization even within powerful tributary empires. By the first millennium BCE, commercial activity was already widespread in much of China; even land could be bought and sold. And by the middle of that millennium, the appearance of a powerful and independent merchant class was noted in the literary classics of the late Zhou dynasty, including the writings of Confucius (the Latinized form of Kong Fuzi, or “Master Kong.,” who lived ca. 551-479 BCE). By the time of the early Han dynasty, there were wealthy merchants who catered to the needs of rulers and nobles, petty merchants who bought and sold in provincial centers, and peddlers who bought and sold in the villages, thereby bringing villagers, too, within networks of commerce. Changan (modern Xian), the Han capital, covered almost 34 square kilometers, a much larger area than contemporary Rome, which covered only 13 square kilometers.27 In the large towns, according to the imperial historian Sima Qian (who wrote at the end of the second century BCE), one could buy “alcoholic drinks, prepared foodstuffs, silks, hemp cloth, dyes, hides, furs, lacquerware, copper and iron goods.”28 A description from the same period suggests the increased visibility of a distinctive and wealthy merchant class, and also conveys the air of disapproval with which merchants were normally treated by members of the traditional nobility:



Well-to-do merchants accumulate goods and redouble their profits, while the less well-to-do sit in their shops and sell. They control the markets and daily enjoy their ease in the cities. They take advantage of the pressing needs of the government to sell at twice the normal price. Their sons do not plough or hoe. Their daughters do not raise silkworms or weave. They have fancy clothing and stuff themselves on millet and meat. They earn fortunes while suffering none of the hardships which the farmers suffer. Their wealth enables them to hobnob with princes and marquises, and to dispose of greater power than the officials.29





Increased commercial activity, by offering new forms of revenue to states, could eventually have subtle but important effects on state systems. But it was least likely to transform states that had easy access to traditional forms of revenue, such as land taxes—most notably, large, tributary empires such as Han China, which controlled huge areas of land. Nevertheless, where traditional fiscal methods proved ineffective, commercialization could transform even the most powerful tributary states. The shift can be seen clearly in China during the postclassical Malthusian cycle. After the long period of imperial breakdown that followed the collapse of the later Han dynasty early in the third century CE, China was reunited during the Sui (589-617) and Tang (618-906) dynasties. Under the Tang, strong central rule and relatively orderly government made possible rapid growth of urban populations and of commercial activity, particularly in the south. And the Tang proved exceptionally open to foreign influences, whether in religion (this was the great era of Chinese Buddhism) or in trade. But the Tang were not particularly supportive of private commercial activity. Their tax base lay in the land, and until the An Lushan rebellion (755–63), they administered land taxes with an efficiency never again matched. They thus had little need for or interest in commercial revenues. Accordingly, the Tang for the most part maintained a traditional disdain for commerce and commercial activities, both at home and abroad. For example, merchants were not allowed to take the civil service exams.

However, the rulers of the Song dynasty (960–1276) found themselves in a much weaker position. After the Tang dynasty collapsed in the tenth century, much of northern China was lost to the Khitan (Liao) dynasty. In 1125, the Song dynasty lost its remaining control of the north to the Manchurian Jurchen (Jin) dynasty. Forced to relocate to the more commercially minded south, the Song moved their capital from Kaifeng to Hangzhou. Facing constant military challenges in the north, without the huge tributary revenues available within a unified China, and in the more entrepreneurial environment of southern China, the rulers of the later Song dynasty began to look more benignly on commercial activity and those who engaged in it. In the twelfth century, they even allowed successful merchants to buy official rank; and Marco Polo was told that the Song emperor had invited wealthy merchants to his palace, which would have been unthinkable under the Tang.30 This shift in attitudes was driven by hard fiscal realities. By the mid-thirteenth century, 20 percent of Song revenues came from tolls on foreign trade, compared to only ca. 2 percent 200 years before.31 Not surprisingly, the southern Song began to actively promote commercial activity and technological innovation. Whereas under the Tang, Guangzhou (Canton) was the only port allowed to take part in foreign trade, under the Song, seven more ports were opened. Aiding such trade were the very advanced junks built under the southern Song. They used compasses and stern-post rudders and had watertight bulkheads and special buoyancy chambers.32 Internal commerce also flourished, particularly in the south, where populations were booming and trade networks with Southeast Asia and Japan were developing rapidly. To support increased monetization, the Song produced huge amounts of coinage; by 1080, they were minting about 6 million strings of coins a year (or ca. 200 coins per person), whereas the Tang had normally issued no more than 100,000 to 200,000 a year (ca. 10 coins per person).33

We have seen already that commercial exchanges are more likely to generate efficiency-raising innovations than are tributary exchanges, in which coercion can take the place of efficiency. And where states look benignly on commercial activity and create a supportive political and legal environment, it is reasonable to expect signs of increasing openness to innovation. This theoretical prediction certainly seems to be borne out by the history of the Song dynasty, for despite their political weakness, the Song presided over a period of astonishing growth and innovation.

By the middle of the eleventh century, China was divided between three large powers: the Song, the Khitan in the north and northeast, and the Tangut or Xia kingdom in the northwest. This period of divided rule was the prelude to an era of extraordinary technological innovation, which provided a kind of climax to the long process of Southernization. First, the agricultural foundations of the Song economy were revolutionized. According to Mark Elvin,



the agricultural revolution … had four aspects. (1) Farmers learned to prepare their soil more effectively as the result of new knowledge, improved or new tools, and the more extensive use of manure, river mud and lime as fertilizers. (2) Strains of seed were introduced which either gave heavier yields, or resisted drought better, or else by ripening more rapidly made it possible to grow two crops a year on the same land. (3) A new level of proficiency was reached in hydraulic techniques, and irrigation networks of unprecedented intricacy constructed. (4) Commerce made possible more specialization in crops other than the basic foodgrains, and so a more efficient exploitation of varying resource endowments.34





Indeed, he concludes that by the thirteenth century, China likely had the most productive agricultural sector in the world, with the possible exception of India.

Supportive governments also encouraged innovation in other areas of the economy. The widespread use by governments and officials of woodblock printing to disseminate technical knowledge ensured that new techniques and new methods of inquiry in metallurgy, armaments, farming, medicine, and engineering spread widely. Coal and perhaps coke were used in the manufacture of iron; and official statistics show that by 1078, iron production had reached 113,000 metric tons a year, the equivalent of ca. 1.4 kilograms per person. This level of production was six times what had normally been produced under the Tang, and it was not matched in Europe before the eighteenth century.35 At about the same time, two government arsenals were producing as many as 32,000 suits of armor a year, in three different sizes. Copper production rose so sharply that Greenland glaciers today show a sudden increase in atmospheric copper pollution in this era.36 The technology of gunpowder was also pioneered under the Song, though its explosive properties were first deployed in war by their northern rivals, the Jurchen (Jin), in 1221. By the end of the thirteenth century, the first guns were in use in northern China.37 By the eleventh century, a silk-reeling machine had been invented—the earliest known attempt to mechanize textile production.38 There was significant innovation also in commercial methods (see figure 12.1). Early in the eleventh century, the government even started backing the issue of paper money.39

The innovations of this period were not purely Chinese. Rather, they reflected an increasing willingness on the part of governments and elites to exploit new productive and commercial ideas, whatever their source. Much Chinese innovation was based on a pooling of knowledge that had accumulated in other parts of the Afro-Eurasian system. For example, the new strains of rice that sustained the population boom in the south were imported from Vietnam. Many other techniques were imported from India or the Islamic world. Hydraulic techniques were particularly well developed in the Islamic world, where irrigation had a history of several thousand years; methods of textile manufacture were highly developed in India. The research of Joseph Needham into Chinese technology has highlighted the technological virtuosity of China, but it may also have unwittingly obscured the innovative technologies of other regions of the Afro-Eurasian world system.40

Nevertheless, rates of innovation under the Song were exceptional. Indeed, so astonishing is the extent of commercialization and innovation under the Song dynasty that it is tempting to think that medieval China was on the verge of an industrial revolution of its own. But if there was a revolution, it was not sustained and thus could not revolutionize the world. There are three main reasons that it failed to spark widespread change. First, the factors that encouraged the Song rulers to back commerce and entrepreneurial activity proved ephemeral; second, China’s location at the edge, not at the hub, of Afro-Eurasian exchange networks slowed the spread of its innovations to other regions; and third, the world system as a whole was not yet large or integrated enough to ensure that innovation in China would rapidly infect other regions.

A system of competing states proved to be an unstable configuration in China. Well-established traditions of political and cultural unity, and well-integrated communications systems, made it likely that sooner or later, China would be reunified and the commercial and technological wealth of the Song period would be devoted once again to supporting a powerful united dynasty. In fact, this process was completed by 1279 after the conquest of South China by the Mongols under Kublai Khan. After reunification, two of the three conditions encouraging states to support commercialization (small size and intense rivalries) vanished, and the third (easy access to rich trading systems) lasted only slightly longer. China ceased to be a region of vulnerable and competing states keen to take revenues from any available source. Under the Yuan and Ming dynasties, government revenues shifted back to more traditional tributary sources, such as taxes from the peasantry.41 The sheer size of a united China meant that commercial revenues would find it hard to compete with more traditional sources of revenues. And over the centuries that followed, the colossal inertia of this huge system made the shift from traditional revenues more complex and difficult than it might have been in a region of smaller, competing states.

In the fifteenth century, Chinese governments disengaged almost entirely from world trade networks, even if many of their subjects continued to trade despite the obstacles they now faced. The naval traditions of the Song survived until the fifteenth century. Indeed, between 1405 and 1433, under the command of a Muslim eunuch, Zheng He, seven separate fleets containing up to sixty ships and 40,000 soldiers were sent on journeys to the west (see figure 12.2).42 They reached Ceylon, Mecca, and East Africa and may even have touched land in northern Australia. But these were not primarily trading missions, and the government that backed them was not looking for commercial revenues so much as symbolic submission to China. Not surprisingly, it had a limited stake in their continuance, particularly as they cost the state dearly. Eventually, deciding that the money was better spent defending its vulnerable northern borders, the Ming government lost interest in these expensive expeditions. Within a few decades the government had banned all Chinese shipping, though determined Chinese traders could usually find ways around these restrictions.

Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven huge Chinese fleets with up to 60 ships and 40,000 soldiers in voyages to India, Southwest Asia, and East Africa, navigating with surprisingly accurate maps of all the lands he visited. His largest ships were at least five times the length of Columbus’s ship, the Santa Maria, and they had watertight internal compartments. Columbus sailed fifty years after Zheng’s last voyage. His fleet lacked many of the technological refinements of the Chinese fleets, and he was far more ignorant of where he was going. Nevertheless, Columbus’s ships were more maneuverable, and probably better suited to the exploration of unfamiliar seas. Courtesy Relics Publishing House, Beijing.



The second factor that lessened the impact of the economic revolution under the Song was China’s geographical position, at the edge of the Afro-Eurasian network of exchanges. Though the volume of exchanges in China was vast, Chinese exchange networks neither reached as far nor carried as diverse information and goods as the exchange networks of hub regions such as the Islamic heartland in Mesopotamia typically did; thus, their influence on other parts of the Afro-Eurasian world was limited. Chinese innovations certainly had consequences elsewhere: many inventions, including the use of movable type for printing, the use of paper money (and the technology to make paper), and the use of gunpowder, reached the West, where their eventual impact was revolutionary. In addition, China’s vast commercial momentum drew traders eastward by both land and sea. But these development made little immediate impression outside of China itself.

Third, and related to this last point, was the loose integration of the Afro-Eurasian networks, and their isolation from the networks of other world zones. The sluggishness with which Chinese innovations were taken up elsewhere suggests that the preconditions for a worldwide industrial revolution existed neither in China nor in the rest of the world. Exchanges of goods, ideas, and wealth were still restricted by technologies of communications that had changed little since the first millennium BCE. One sign of the limits of information exchanges is the immense ignorance about China that prevailed in medieval Europe, an ignorance matched only by Chinese un-familiarity with western Afro-Eurasia.

In short, during the postclassical Malthusian cycle, Afro-Eurasian exchange networks, though not as connected as in modern times, were more integrated than ever before, and commercial activity flourished in all major agrarian civilizations. Innovation was more rapid than in the classical era, particularly during the astonishing era of growth under the Song. And much innovation, in this as in previous eras, came from states in which rulers were closely allied to mercantile elites and linked in widespread networks of commercial and information exchange.





THE EARLY MODERN MALTHUSIAN CYCLE: THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY





The First Global Network of Exchanges




In the fifteenth century, after the long slump associated with the Black Death, populations rose again throughout Afro-Eurasia. Once again, population growth stimulated commerce and urbanization. The commercial networks of the preceding cycle, which had decayed for much of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, revived in the early sixteenth century—but now they reached even further. European traders played an important role in creating these links, now operating mainly by sea. And the activities of European merchants and sailors, usually with government backing, eventually led to one of the most significant breakthroughs of this period: the appearance of the first exchange networks to circle the globe. The bridging of the Atlantic early in the sixteenth century was an event of truly world-historical significance, and it is no accident that most historians of modernity, particularly within the Marxist tradition, have counted it as one of the defining events of the last millennium. As Marx himself put it: “World trade and the world market date from the sixteenth century, and from then on the modern history of Capital starts to unfold.”43

The system of exchanges that first appeared in the sixteenth century linked the markets of Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and eventually even Melanesia, Australia, and Polynesia into the first truly global world system.44 The new system was almost twice the size of any that had earlier existed, and it contained a much greater variety of goods and resources. The size of the new system and the scale of the exchanges that took place within it meant that more wealth was in circulation than ever before in world history. The sheer volume of wealth now flowing through international systems of exchange made the gradient between the largest and the smallest reservoirs of wealth in the world much steeper, and it increased the influence of the merchants and financiers who handled these exchanges. The widening gulf between the rich and the poor energized commercial flows of many kinds, and the economic “voltage” accumulating within the new global system drove a commercial motor of unprecedented power. Silver looted from the Americas by Spain energized European and world commerce, as it worked its way through Europe or moved via the Philippines to India and then to China. Chinese demand for silver (driven by the devaluation of paper and copper currencies, widespread commercialization in the countryside, and the monetization of taxation) fueled the global trade in silver.45

But other exchanges were as important. The transmission both ways of crops, of technologies, of peoples, and even of disease bacteria made possible by the linking of the Afro-Eurasian and American world systems is described in Alfred Crosby’s The Columbian Exchange (1972). The swapping of diseases ensured that global integration was a destructive process for all the smaller world zones. By 1500 CE, exchanges of diseases within the more densely settled parts of Afro-Eurasia had increased overall immunities throughout Afro-Eurasia. But no such toughening had occurred in the Americas or the even more isolated communities of the Australasian and Pacific world zones. Thus, when Europeans reached the Americas in the sixteenth century, bringing their diseases with them, it was overwhelmingly the Americans who died of Eurasian diseases rather than the other way around.46

Our figures are only educated guesses, but in the more densely settled regions of Mesoamerica and Peru, the fall in populations during the sixteenth century was truly catastrophic: populations may have fallen by as much as 70 percent, while populations in the Americas as a whole may have fallen anywhere from 50 to 70 percent.47 Contemporaries, on both sides of the divide, were aware of imbalance in the exchange of diseases. As a native American from Yucatán put it, before the Europeans came “there was then no sickness; they had no aching bones; they had then no high fever; they had then no smallpox [see figure 12.3]; they had then no burning chest; they had then no abdominal pain; they had then no consumption; they had then no headache. At that time the course of humanity was orderly. The foreigners made it otherwise when they arrived here.”48 English colonists from the Roanoke Island settlement of 1585 made the same observation, but from the other side of the epidemiological frontier. Thomas Hariot, the colony’s surveyor, wrote that after they had visited native towns or villages,



within a few dayes after our departure from everies such townes, that people began to die very fast, and many in short space; in some townes about twenties, in some fourtie, in some sixtie, and in one sixe score, which in truth was very manie in respect to their numbers… . The disease also was also so strange that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; the like by report of the oldest men in the countrey never happened before, time out of mind.49





Other populations suffered just as severely when Europeans migrated to Australasia and the Pacific. Sub-Saharan Africans were usually spared, because they had always been part of the wider Afro-Eurasian networks; in any case, they inhabited an even more dangerous bacteriological environment than most Eurasians. Elsewhere, Eurasian diseases removed native populations, making settlement easier for the Eurasian migrants that eventually turned large areas of the smaller world zones into Eurasian colonies, with Eurasian crops, domesticates, pests, and diseases.50

While the introduction of Eurasian domesticates transformed the economies, the social structures, and the exchange networks of the Americas, the introduction of American domesticates had almost as great an impact in Afro-Eurasia. From the Americas came maize, beans, peanuts, many varieties of potato, sweet potato, manioc (cassava, tapioca), squashes, pumpkin, papaya, guava, avocado, pineapple, tomato, chili pepper, and cocoa.51 Manioc has become a staple in many tropical regions of the Afro-Eurasian zone; maize and potatoes are staples in many temperate zones. In China, American crops were adopted more rapidly than anywhere else in Afro-Eurasia, after being introduced by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century.52 Sweet potatoes were being grown as early as the 1560s, and more than a third of all crops today grown in China are of American origin.53 Because such crops flourished where more familiar staples grew less well, American crops effectively increased the area under cultivation and thereby made possible population growth in many parts of Afro-Eurasia from the sixteenth century onward.

Patterns of Growth and Innovation




The vastly expanded flows of wealth and information generated in this period had a profound impact on states and societies throughout the world. In the Americas, their initial impact was rapid and destructive. Global integration caused the death of millions of individuals and the end of traditional empires, states, cultures, and religions. And the pattern was to repeated in each new world entered by Europeans, from Mauritius to Hawai’i.

In the Afro-Eurasian zone, the effects were subtler and slower to manifest themselves. But in much of Afro-Eurasia, and certainly in the most densely populated core zones, new and expanded exchange networks, population growth, state activity, and commercialization encouraged growth and innovation. As Joel Mokyr puts it:



The age of discoveries was … the age of exposure effects, in which technological change primarily took the form of observing alien technologies and crops and transplanting them elsewhere. The aggressive Europeans adopted crops from America in exchange for the livestock, wheat, and grapes they transplanted into the New World. Furthermore, they also transplanted non-European flora from America into Africa and Asia and back in a massive act of what could be called ecological arbitrage. Thus, they introduced bananas, sugar, and rice into the New World, and cassava (also known as manioc) into Africa, where it eventually became the staple crop in many areas.54





Population increases were partly caused by the “innovation” of using American crops in Europe, China, and Africa. Cultivation of these new crops required a whole series of minor agricultural innovations, including different types of crop rotation, plowing, and irrigation. In China, the new crops were particularly important because they could be sown in regions unsuitable for rice; they also brought great change in Africa.55 But there were significant developments as well in seafaring and in warships (which provided the technological resources for the creation of a unified world system in the sixteenth century), in mining technologies, in warfare, and in commercial methods.

However, rates of innovation were in some ways unimpressive; nowhere do they rise to the level found during the Industrial Revolution. Even in Europe, where the appearance of a global world system had the greatest immediate commercial impact, technological innovation in the middle centuries of the millennium—in areas outside warfare, shipping, instrument building, and metallurgy—was surprisingly sluggish.56 As Peter Stearns observes:



Western technology [in 1700] and production methods remained firmly anchored in the basic traditions of agricultural societies, particularly in terms of reliance on human and animal power. Agriculture itself had scarcely changed in method since the fourteenth century. Manufacturing, despite some important new techniques, continued to entail combining skill with hand tools and was usually carried out in very small shops. The most important Western response to new manufacturing opportunities involved a great expansion of rural (domestic) production, particularly in textiles but also in small metal goods.57





In Afro-Eurasia, the large-scale effects of the new global networks of exchange were subtler and less direct. In all the core regions, population grew and commercial activity expanded. In China, between 1400 and 1700, population rose from ca. 70 to ca. 150 million. In India, in the same period, population rose from 74 to 175 million, and in Europe, from 52 to 95 million (see table 11.1). According to one recent estimate, Asian populations continued to grow faster than those of Europe well into the eighteenth century, at which time Asia contained ca. 66 percent of the world’s population and produced almost 80 percent of the total value of the world’s goods and services.58 Historians used to assume that population growth in East Asia must have led to greater poverty in this era, but that assumption was wrong. On the contrary, as Andre Gunder Frank argues, it seems that



Asians were preponderant in the world economy and system not only in population and production, but also in productivity, competitiveness, trade, in a word, capital formation until 1750 or 1800. Moreover, contrary to latter-day European mythology, Asians had the technology and developed the economic and financial institutions to match. Thus, the “locus” of accumulation and power in the modern world system did not really change much during those centuries. China, Japan, and India in particular ranked first overall, with Southeast Asia and West Asia not far behind.59





Indeed, as noted above, the dominance of Asian economies was understood by European observers such as Adam Smith even in the late eighteenth century. Nor was Europe yet dominant technologically. Philip Curtin writes that in the seventeenth century,



the “European Age” in world history had not yet dawned. The Indian economy was still more productive than that of Europe. Even per capita productivity of seventeenth-century India or China was probably greater than that of Europe—though very low by recent standards. Europe’s clear technological lead was still limited to select fields like maritime transportation, where design of sailing ships advanced enormously through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Otherwise, Europe imported Asian manufactures, not the reverse.60





That surpluses of silver gravitated toward Asia throughout this period also suggests the centrality of Asia in the emerging world system of trade. And these changes were not just skin-deep: commercial activity affected all levels of society. In China, the government began collecting most of its taxes in cash rather than in kind in the sixteenth century, a clear sign of the extent of commercial exchanges even in the countryside. As Kenneth Pomeranz has shown, measures such as consumption of sugar or textiles or other nonessentials, as well as statistics on life expectancy, suggest that in the eighteenth century, standards of living were as high in China as in Europe.61

By all these measures, the expansion phase of the early modern Malthusian cycle—despite the vastly increased scale of exchange networks—was fairly typical in stimulating a moderate degree of innovation, not the high levels characteristic of the modern era. We might thus expect that much of the world was headed, sooner or later, for a Malthusian decline of some kind. There was a slowdown in growth in much of Afro-Eurasia in the seventeenth century, though not nearly as sharp a decline as that seen at the end of the previous cycle. Soon afterward, growth resumed in many different parts of the world, even in areas such as India and China that were to lag significantly in the nineteenth century. As late as 1800, observers such as Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus had good reason to assume that the pattern of Malthusian cycles that we have seen operating in the era of agrarian civilizations was a permanent feature of economic life.62 And some modern researchers have argued that, absent one or two largely chance circumstances such as the existence of large coal reserves in Britain, they may have been close to the mark.63

However, there were other changes during the early modern Malthusian cycle that prepared the way for the decisive developments of the nineteenth century.





The Impact of Commercialization in Tributary Societies




Social structure models of innovation suggest that we should expect innovation to be most rapid where all sectors of society are tightly integrated into commercial networks, so that all sectors of society are influenced by the rules of efficiency and productivity that ensure success in a competitive commercial environment. The simplified version of Marxist models described in the previous chapter points to the importance of focusing on the impact of increased commercialization in two main areas: first, the increasing influence and power of mercantile elites; and second, the increasing involvement of the rural population (the majority of the population in most agrarian civilizations) in commercial activities of various kinds, until finally, when debts or expropriation sever them entirely from the land, they become wage earners whose lives are totally dominated by commercial networks.

Much research within the Marxist tradition has explored these issues, demonstrating that in most core areas of the Afro-Eurasian zone such processes had made great headway. Merchants and markets were of vital importance to the functioning even of the most traditional agrarian societies. Less commercialized states such as Poland or Muscovy actively supported commerce and, where possible, colonial expansion, particularly into such potentially profitable regions as the fur-rich lands of Siberia. In these ways, large parts of the world occupied by kin-ordered societies of various kinds were drawn into commercial exchange networks, often with profound effects on their traditional ways of life.64

Such changes could transform states, as increased reliance on commercial sources of revenue reduced the relative significance of traditional tributary revenues from feudal dues or land taxes, forcing even large tributary states to take more interest in commercial activities. Like many traditional states, Muscovite governments established monopolies over the most lucrative trades, including those in precious metals or furs. But in the seventeenth century, they began to explore ways of taxing domestic trades as well by levying sales taxes on salt and particularly on vodka. These items were strategic, for in a country where most peasants were largely self-sufficient, they were the only staples that could not be produced in the household, and therefore had to be purchased. Salt was necessary to preserve foods, while vodka soon became a vital ingredient of religious and social rituals in the villages. In 1724, taxes on liquor sales already accounted for 11 percent of government revenues; by the early nineteenth century, vodka taxes constituted the single largest source of revenue, providing between 30 percent and 40 percent of the government’s total income.65 As commercial revenues became increasingly important, the Russian government found that despite its professed hostility toward merchants, it had to dicker with them. At several points in the 1850s, the government feared that failure to offer sufficiently attractive terms to the powerful merchants who ran the liquor tax farms might lead to its bankruptcy. This example of a shift in fiscal practices is particularly striking because the Russian Empire in so many respects remained a paradigmatic tributary society well into the nineteenth century.

Commercialization affected rural areas as much as it did towns and states. In fact, by the middle of the second millennium CE, there were few rural areas within the great civilizations of Afro-Eurasia where peasants were not caught up in commercial activities of some kind. And in all these civilizations, large and growing numbers of people were dependent solely on wage labor. The Chinese countryside was commercialized early. Mark Elvin notes that in Song China, as early as 1000 CE,



increased contact with the market made the Chinese peasantry into a class of adaptable, rational, profit-oriented, petty entrepreneurs. A wide range of new occupations opened up in the countryside. In the hills, timber was grown for the booming boatbuilding industry and for the construction of houses in the expanding cities. Vegetables and fruit were produced for urban consumption. All sorts of oils were pressed for cooking, lighting, waterproofing, and to go in haircreams and medicines. Sugar was refined, crystallized, and used as a preservative. Fish were raised in ponds and reservoirs to the point where the rearing of newly-hatched young fish for stock became a major business… . Growing mulberry leaves became in itself a profitable undertaking, and there were special markets for mulberry saplings. Peasants also made lacquer goods and iron tools.66





The more commercialized the regions the peasants lived in, the more varied their possibilities for generating commercial revenues. They could sell their surpluses of crops or specialize in commercial crops such as litchis or tangerines; they could make and sell fibers or engage in other part-time crafts; they could send individual members of the family to town in search of wage labor. As more of their income came from commercial activities, peasants throughout Afro-Eurasia had to abide by the rules of commerce rather than the rules of tribute. It was no longer enough to pay the tribute demanded by landlords or states; they also had to conform to the standards of productivity or quality demanded by their customers or employers, whether the wool merchants in Europe or the timber or wood merchants in nearby towns. And in this way—sometimes rapidly, sometimes almost imperceptibly—peasants found themselves turned into petty entrepreneurs or wage earners.

But in China as in much of the rest of Afro-Eurasia, such processes had their limits. Though deeply involved in commercial activities of many kinds, peasants everywhere resisted the final step of severing contacts with the land, and governments used to raising traditional land taxes often supported their resistance. In China in the eighteenth century, R. Bin Wong points out, “Many peasants owned at least some of their own property, and many also rented some land. Virtually all land was worked at the household level of production; landlords who expanded their bases of direct production in response to market opportunities were few.”67 Traditional peasants often retained a deep ethical commitment to the ancient principle that they had a right to the land; they believed that the land was not something to be bought and sold, like so many sacks of grain. Such attitudes survived well into the twentieth century in many countries. In Russia as late as 1906, in a petition sent to pro-peasant deputies in the newly established parliament or duma, mutinous peasant soldiers insisted:



In our view, the land is God’s, the land should be free, no one should have the right to buy, sell or mortgage it; the right to buy is fine for the rich, but for the poor it is a very, very bad right… . We soldiers are poor, we have no money to buy land when we return home from service, and every peasant needs land desperately… . The land is God’s, the land is no one’s, the land is free—and on this, God’s free land, should toil God’s free workers, not hired laborers for the gentry and kulaks [rich peasants].68





Though the Chinese countryside was highly commercialized in the eighteenth century, structures of ownership and control of the land limited the extent to which the majority of the population could be involved in commercial networks. And, according to traditional Marxist models, such limits were bound to restrict long-term rates of innovation.

Commercial attitudes and practices had entered deeply into rural life and had even affected the practice of governments in some of the most traditional tributary empires, but they had not yet undermined the structures of power and production typical of traditional agrarian societies.





A NEW GLOBAL TOPOLOGY: THE CHANGING ROLE OF EUROPE




In western Europe, the commercialization of social, political, and economic structures went further than anywhere else in the Afro-Eurasian zone. European societies were younger and more malleable than those of the older core regions; their states were smaller and more susceptible to international commercial pressures; they were also, for reasons that will be discussed later, more open to commercial activities; and perhaps most important of all, the changing topology of global exchange networks ensured that during the early modern Malthusian cycle, the relative volume, variety, and intensity of information and commercial exchanges passing through Europe were greater than anywhere else.





The Changing Topology of Global Exchanges




The creation of a global network of exchanges affected Europe decisively because it was accompanied by a rearrangement in the topology of global exchanges. At the largest scale, the structures of exchange systems in the Afro-Eurasian system had been relatively stable for several millennia, with hub regions at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, in northern India, and in central Asia; since the first millennium BCE, the center of gravity had shifted eastward toward the more densely settled regions of northern India and China. But with the linking of the Afro-Eurasian and American world zones, western Europe and the entire Atlantic coast suddenly emerged as a new hub region, through which flowed most of the exchanges connecting the world zones of Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. What had been a peripheral region in the Afro-Eurasian zone abruptly became the most important hub in the largest network of exchanges that had ever existed. Even if the center of gravity of global exchange systems remained in the Far East as late as 1800 CE, the greatest diversity of exchanges could be found in the new hub region of western Europe.

This was a fact of immense consequence, in particular for the future of Europe. It was in a sense contingent. Europe was in the right place to take advantage of the vastly increased exchanges of the emerging global exchange network. Having been on the margins of the Afro-Eurasian system for millennia, Europe in the sixteenth century had the good fortune to suddenly find itself at the hub of the largest and most varied network of exchange in history. Its repositioning in the center of the new global network revolutionized the life of the entire region. The exchanges now passing through Europe were much larger than any previous flows of this kind. The transfers of silver from the Americas to Europe to the Islamic world and on to the Far East between the sixteenth century and the nineteenth century provide just one instance of Europe’s crucial role as middleman.69 Clearly, we do not need to rely on European exceptionalism to explain Europe’s distinctive role in the modern world, just as we do not need to treat the emergence of urban civilization in Sumer as a sign of that region’s exceptionalism. As Andrew Sherratt has argued,



western Europe only stumbled on a new role with the discovery of the New World and the growth of Atlantic links. There is thus no predetermined relationship between social or economic sophistication and the way a region develops; from a local stand-point, change is often arbitrary and unpredictable. Enlargement of the world-system, and alterations of its shape and connections, thrusts areas into new roles for which at the time they often seem unfitted.70





As in Sumer, more than 4,000 years before, a sudden increase in the scale of exchanges and a sudden rearrangement of exchange networks encouraged and made possible a quite new scale of investment in what had previously been a backwater.71

But we should not make too much of contingencies, for Europe’s strategic position was not entirely accidental. Other regions within the Afro-Eurasian world zone might have built and financed merchant fleets capable of traveling around the entire globe, perhaps fleets similar to those commanded by the Ming admiral Zheng He early in the fifteenth century. If they had done so, they, rather than the Atlantic rim, might have become the hubs of the new global system. Indeed, a world in which hub and center of gravity coincided in China might have generated an even more rapid and chaotic modern revolution than the one we know, whose hub and center of gravity long lay in different parts of the world. The topology of the new system was not determined purely by geography; Europe became the hub of the new global system of exchanges in part because it was preadapted for the role.

In two ways, western European societies were exceptionally well prepared to survive in the new, global commercial system that emerged in the sixteenth century. First, they were young and flexible. States emerged in northwestern Europe within the past 1,500 years. By then, powerful and successful states had already existed for more than 3,000 years in Mesopotamia and at least 2,000 years in China. The success of these large, tributary states is a measure of the extent to which their political and military structures, their class alliances, and their values were adapted to the social and political ecology of the agrarian era. In contrast, the younger polities of Europe evolved in a more commercialized world. Their structures and traditions of government, their characteristic class alliances and attitudes, and their traditions of warfare were adapted to this very different social and political environment. Of course, there were striking differences between different European states, differences that are described superbly in Charles Tilly’s Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992 (rev. ed., 1992). Nevertheless, the general rule stands: the state systems of Europe north of the Mediterranean (and the new colonial states of the Americas to an even greater degree) evolved their basic structures and attitudes in a more commercialized world than that of the classical era.

Second, the European state system was characterized by a cluster of features that we have seen before (in chapter 10), whose combined effect was to encourage elites to look more benignly on commercial activity. In western Europe, unlike in Mesopotamia or China, no new tributary empires emerged after the collapse of those that had ruled the region in the classical era. The Holy Roman Empire aspired to but failed to achieve this role. As a result, western Europe emerged during the postclassical Malthusian cycle as a region of many small states, in constant competition and close to the major trading routes of the Mediterranean world. This is a familiar setup.72 In periods of limited commercialization, such as the era in which the city-states of classical Greece flourished, this cluster of factors created commercially and militarily adventurous polities that could prove surprisingly powerful. Their traders traveled much of the known world; and, as noted above, their armies could sometimes challenge even the juggernauts of the tributary world, as the Greek city-states did at the battles of Marathon and Salamis that drove back the Persians. But they could not hope to replace the great empires permanently. In the much more commercialized world of the eighteenth century, analogous differences between states and regions could prove more decisive.

These two factors explain why European societies were already well adapted to the economic, political, and military realities of a highly commercialized world. More specifically, they help explain the extremely competitive and often brutal commercialism typical of European trading systems from the fifteenth century onward. In the expansion phase after the Black Death, European states engaged in a life-and-death struggle for a share of the commercial wealth available in expanding Eurasian trade networks. Even the most traditional of states, such as the militaristic polities that expelled Islamic rulers from Spain, or the powerful French state ruled by Louis XVI, understood the importance of commercial revenues. The Spanish monarchy, in its heyday, relied overwhelmingly on commercial revenues and loans, while seventeenth-century governments in France depended on a wide range of new consumption and commercial taxes.73 Increasing commercial activity and government interest and support helped drive European improvements in ship design and navigation, in textile working (textiles were the second-largest economic sector in most premodern economies), in canal locks, and even, perhaps, in printing. Indirectly, they were factors in the Iberian conquest of Atlantic trade networks and the subsequent conquest of the agrarian civilizations of the Americas.74 The huge wealth extracted from the Americas—and the immense commercial, political, and military power that could be built on these revenues, as the examples of Spain and Portugal made clear—encouraged an intensification of this aggressive commercialism, which became the hallmark of European states in the early modern period. This complex of state power dependent on commercial revenues also explains why European ships could be found in all parts of the world by the sixteenth century.

So it was not entirely by accident that Europe found itself at the hub of the new, global system of exchanges. The appearance of a highly competitive world of expansionist and commercialized states on the shores of the Atlantic guaranteed that eventually the Atlantic would be bridged. Indeed, a fragile and all-too-temporary bridge had already been built by Viking navigators in the previous Malthusian cycle, prefiguring the aggressive expansionism of European states in later centuries.





The Impact of Global Exchange Networks in Europe




Europe’s strategic position made it certain that Europe would be affected by changes in this new global system more decisively than any other part of the world. Information exchanges have too often been ignored in accounts of modern world history. Yet, as I have argued in previous chapters, at large scales, changes in the amount and variety of information exchanged between different communities may be a crucial determinant of rates of innovation. Europe in the early modern period found itself swamped by new information. At the hub of the new global exchange system, it was the first to receive a mass of new knowledge about the New World, as well as about other regions of Afro-Eurasia. Europe became a sort of clearinghouse for new geographical and cultural lore. Thus it was here that the torrent of new information flowing through the first global exchange network had its earliest and greatest impact on intellectual life and activity.

The digestion of this new mass of information transformed European intellectual life. Margaret Jacob writes that “the cumulative effect” of the travel literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries “had been to call into question the absolute validity of religious customs long regarded, especially by the clergy, as paramount.”75 As the arena of information exchange expanded, and as the printing press circulated ideas more quickly, traditional systems of knowledge faced ever harsher tests of their truth claims and had to shed many of their more parochial features. As Andrew Sherratt has recently written in an essay stressing the role of widespread exchanges in human history, “‘Intellectual Evolution’ … consists principally in the emergence of modes of thinking appropriate for larger and larger human groupings… . This transferability has been manifested in the last five hundred years in the growth of science, with its striving for culture-free criteria of acceptance[.]”76 This infusion of new information and knowledge is the best available explanation for the radical skepticism about traditional accounts of reality that lies at the heart of the modern scientific project and that first becomes apparent in Europe in the sixteenth century. From the seventeenth century onward, European “natural philosophers” knew that they were working with a vastly expanded body of information, much of which undermined the credibility of traditional maps of reality. Steven Shapin observes, “Philosophical schemes based on restricted knowledge were likely to be faulty for just that reason, and the expanded experience afforded, for example, by the voyages of discovery to the New World was an important support for currents of early modern skepticism about traditional philosophical systems.”77 Skepticism about the very foundations of knowledge, a search for increasingly universal conclusions (exemplified by Newton’s laws of gravity), and more rigorous testing procedures (such as those used by Galileo) can thus be seen as important consequences of the expanded framework within which knowledge systems were tested in an emerging global system of information exchanges.

The impact of global networks of exchange on European social, political, and economic structures is more familiar but was equally significant. European merchants and the rulers who backed them were rewarded spectacularly and rapidly. Spanish soldiers conquered the agrarian heartlands of Mesoamerica and Peru, while Portuguese, French, Dutch, and British expeditions began to colonize other regions of the Americas previously occupied by stateless communities of farmers or foragers. The windfall of American silver sustained Spanish power in the sixteenth century. Indeed, Spain depended so heavily on American silver that when the supply ran out in the seventeenth century, its commercial and political influence declined. American silver also helped European traders, usually with the backing of their governments, fight or buy their way into the rich trade networks of Asia. As Andre Gunder Frank has suggested, the piratical way they gate-crashed the commercial networks of South and Southeast Asia during this period is analogous to how the Mongol armies had seized the trade routes of the Silk Roads three centuries before.78 European traders now began to take on the linking role played by the Mongols in the world system of the thirteenth century, but they did so in the far larger arena of the new global trading system.

The rewards of such activities encouraged mercantile elites and states to build on the tentative alliances they had constructed earlier. Serious dependence on commercial revenues gave states a particular structure and distinctive policies. First, merchants often enjoyed unusually high status in such polities; in some, such as Venice or Holland, they were the state. Second, states dependent on commercial revenues had to support commercial activity, and they therefore protected the rights of merchants with an enthusiasm uncommon in the larger and more traditional agrarian empires. Such policies often drew states directly into commercial warfare. Finally, such an environment could have even subtler effects on the attitudes of ruling elites, by encouraging them increasingly to think not just about ways of capturing tributes but also about ways of generating new entrepreneurial wealth. The mercantilist policies of European states in the seventeenth century—such as the Navigation Acts of the English commonwealth, which protected British commerce within British colonies—are good examples of new government attitudes toward commerce and the actions that these changes encouraged. Also illustrating this trend is the proliferation throughout Europe of patent laws, which were pioneered in Venice in the fifteenth century. Governments also began to promote innovation through the founding of scientific societies or the offering of prizes. (The most famous of these prizes belongs, strictly speaking, to the next chapter. In 1714, the British government offered an award for the construction of a clock robust and reliable enough to be carried on a ship so that sailors could determine longitude. The prize was not claimed successfully until 1762 by John Harrison.)79

Over time, commercialization transformed traditional tributary elites. Such transformation was most likely to occur when demands on elite incomes rose sharply in environments where commercial revenues were available for the taking. The English wool trade offers a classic example, for it tempted landowners to clear the land of tenants and replace them with sheep, particularly in the sixteenth century, when new land became available as a result of the dissolution of the monasteries. In England, a traditional tributary aristocracy became increasingly engaged in commerce, either by producing wool for the markets of Flanders, or by investing in foreign trade or piracy (such as the expeditions of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins), or by marrying into the merchantry. Behind the complex rituals of aristocratic precedence that survived in the early modern period, we can see a slow change in the personnel and in the nature of the nobility. Throughout western Europe, nobles were being imperceptibly transformed from tribute takers into commercial and entrepreneurial landowners. Many nobles, like the French judicial scholar Charles Loyseau, doubtless continued to believe throughout this period that “it is gain, whether vile or sordid, that derogates from nobility, whose proper role is to live off rents.”80 But in practice, this idealized image of the nobility as a class of tribute extractors was becoming more and more anachronistic. Inspection of their account books would have shown that many were turning slowly into capitalists, even though they might have been horrified to be told so. At the same time, merchants “commercialized” the nobility by marrying into it, by buying titles (particularly in France), or by establishing partnerships with aristocrats keen to exploit their financial and commercial expertise. Where aristocrats refused to act more entrepreneurially or to ally with merchants who could help them do so, they eventually failed. In nineteenth-century Russian literature, the classic symbols of such failure include Stepan Oblonsky (Anna Karenina’s brother) and Mme Ranevsky in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard.

Alliances between merchants and governments could eventually turn into symbiosis. Many governments had worked closely with merchants before, and some had included merchants within their structures; but now such cooperation began to take place even in moderately large states with a global reach. In some cases, merchants became integral to government. At the one extreme was Holland, where the merchantry was the government; at the other was Spain or Russia, where traditional governments relied only reluctantly on merchants for loans or the conduct of important commercial operations. In between were states such as Britain and France, in which merchants and mercantile activities of various kinds were gradually incorporated within the structures of government.81

One of the most spectacular products of the emerging symbiosis between governments and merchants was a highly commercialized style of warfare, which eventually enabled mercantile states to compete successfully with tributary empires in war as well as in commerce. The violently competitive environment within Europe itself ensured that the commercialization of European states would commercialize warfare, too. This process, sustained by massive flows of American silver, led to a revolution in military technology that raised both the destructiveness and the cost of warfare to entirely new levels. Charles Tilly has argued that in Europe, states formed primarily in response to the needs of war.82 As in early Sumer and so many other regional systems of competing small- or medium-sized states, warfare was endemic. Thus preparing for war and mobilizing the needed soldiers, weaponry, and supplies were central tasks of government. The military consequences of such systems are captured well in a conversation that a Jesuit, Giuldo Aldeni, had with a Chinese friend who asked, “If there are so many kings, how can you avoid wars?” Aldeni replied that intermarriages between rulers or the authority of popes was sufficient to maintain the peace, but his answer was disingenuous. In reality, his Chinese friend was perfectly right: Aldeni’s conversation took place during the Thirty Years’ War.83 China itself provides an interesting contrast, for in the middle of the seventeenth century, the Manchu overthrow of the Ming dynasty led to a period of intense warfare. In these wars, cannon and musket, based on Ottoman or South Asian designs or crafted to Chinese specifications by Europeans in China, played a vital role. But once the Manchu (Qing) dynasty had established its superiority, military innovation slowed again and the gap in military technology between China and Europe began to widen rapidly, leaving China extremely vulnerable by the nineteenth century.84

Yet though the general pattern is an old one, the particular ways in which European states mobilized for war are distinctive. Tilly notes that before the fifteenth century, mobilization for war was handled through methods that we can recognize, broadly, as tributary: “tribes, feudal levies, urban militias, and similar customary forces played the major part in warfare, and monarchs generally extracted what capital they needed as tribute or rent from lands and populations that lay under their immediate control[.]”85 However, from the fifteenth to the early eighteenth century, it became increasingly common for states to purchase or hire troops, often relying on loans from large capitalists to do so. In this way, military victories increasingly became a measure of success in commerce. As early as 1502, a French veteran of the Italian wars, Robert de Balsac, ended a study on warfare with the remark that “most important of all, success in war depends on having enough money to provide whatever the enterprise needs.”86 During the next hundred years, the influx of new forms of wealth sharply raised the stakes in this centuries-old European arms race.

The shift to more commercial methods of war making reflected in part the commercialized nature of the European state system. But equally important was the fundamental change in military techniques known as the gunpowder revolution.87 Its technological roots reached throughout the Afro-Eurasian system. Chinese experiments with gunpowder, under the Song, were probably influenced by knowledge of Byzantine techniques for using oil in incendiary devices (which created Greek fire). This knowledge was transmitted to Southeast Asia, and then China, by Arab intermediaries. The explosive properties of gunpowder were first used in war by the Jin, the northern rivals of the Song, in 1221.88 But it was in Europe that these technologies were developed most fully. Already in the fifteenth century, siege guns had begun to revolutionize warfare, as they required the building of more complex and expensive fortifications. Mobile siege guns spread these costs even further. The increased use of portable muskets in the sixteenth century transformed infantry warfare, making necessary an entirely new level and type of training and discipline. The placing of cannons on ships similarly transformed naval warfare. The rising cost of armies and navies favored those states with the largest treasuries and the sources of funding that could be most readily mobilized—that is, highly commercialized states, such as Holland. But even traditional states, such as Muscovite Russia, turned to new, more commercial, sources of income to pay for military reforms. It was Ivan the Terrible who, in the sixteenth century, began to create the Russian state’s vodka monopoly; by the nineteenth century, it had become the most important of all sources of revenue for the Russian state, covering most of its defense spending.89

Scholars broadly agree that commercial activities profoundly affected European states in the early modern period. There is less agreement about their impact in rural areas of Europe. In traditional historiography, the western European countryside has been viewed as decisively capitalistic and thus utterly different from the countryside of, say, China or India. Recent research has forced us to qualify these conclusions, as we have realized how profoundly commercialized country regions might be, even in East Asia. Nevertheless, it still seems likely that at least in some parts of western Europe (particularly Britain), commercialization of the countryside had proceeded further than in much of East Asia, beginning to transform traditional patterns of ownership and control of the land and to break down traditional structures that protected peasant access to the land.

In Europe, as elsewhere, it was never difficult for commerce to get a toehold in rural areas. Exotic urban trinkets or more vital goods such as salt readily found rural markets, if only in a sort of barter trade. But such trades were unlikely to revolutionize rural lifeways. More important were pressures that forced peasants to seek wage labor as a supplement to farming. Many types of pressure drove European rural dwellers, like their counterparts in East Asia, to supplement their agricultural activities by entering the marketplace. Such pressures could be fiscal. As landlords and governments came to depend on commercial activity, they often demanded that traditional dues or taxes be paid in cash rather than in goods or services, a change that forced taxpayers to earn cash. Population pressure, by creating land shortages, could have the same effect. In many parts of Europe, the population growth of the postclassical Malthusian cycle meant that by the thirteenth century, perhaps half of all peasant households lacked sufficient land to support themselves without seeking wage work of some kind. In their study of preindustrial Europe, Catharina Lis and Hugo Soly note that



in Picardy around 1300 … 12 per cent of the population consisted of landless paupers and beggars, dwelling in huts outside the village, living off wage labor; … 33 per cent cultivated a morsel of ground and were likewise obliged to market their labor to make ends meet; … 36 percent were poor, not owning a plough-team of oxen or horses, but generally succeeding in buying off labor services; … 16 percent had a holding sufficiently large to escape all difficulties; and … 3 percent dominated everyone else.90





Where the land could not generate enough to feed households and cover their obligations to states, landlords, and others (including churches), the peasants had several options. They could try to sell rural produce more advantageously on local markets, though here they often faced competition from larger producers. They could borrow from local moneylenders, which, in an era of expensive credit, was often the most dangerous way of entering the moneyed world. They could also engage in commercial activities within the household, such as spinning or weaving. Such processes, which have come to be known as proto-industrialization, could create entire regions in which rural incomes came primarily from domestic industrial activities. Maxine Berg’s account of domestic industries in Staffordshire in the late seventeenth century gives some idea of their immense variety:



There were wood turning, carpentry and tanning in the Needlewood Forest, coal in south Staffordshire, as well as iron and metal goods including locks, handles, buttons, saddlery and nails, coal and iron in Cannock Chase. Kinver Forest in the southwest had scythesmiths and makers of edge tools, and there were glassworkers on the Staffordshire-Worcestershire border at Stourbridge. Bursham in the northwest had a pottery industry, and there was ironstone mining in the northeast. Leather working and textile weaving in hemp, flax and wool were scattered throughout the country.91





She adds that in Essex in 1629, there were already 40,000 to 50,000 people so dependent on the manufacture of cloths that they “were not able to subsist unless they be continually set on work, and weekly paid,” and a trade crisis could cause instant impoverishment of thousands.92 Households could send some members of the family away to earn wages, either on the land or in nearby towns. Finally, at the bottom of this long and slippery slope, some workers found they had to abandon the land entirely and try to survive as wage laborers.

The strategies familiar in rural areas today could be found in all regions of agrarian civilization where peasants came under significant commercial, fiscal, or demographic pressure. Each maneuver increased the cash component of household budgets, drawing it further into the commercial world. Peasants thus found themselves reluctantly entering the world of capitalism. Here is a description of these processes taken from a social history of seventeenth-century France:



Faced with a staggering and chronic imbalance between the grain they could call their own and the minimum needed for survival, most peasants resorted to improvisation. They rented a few extra acres to supplement their own. They hired out in the busy summer season to work on the larger farms. They cultivated their gardens intensively, selling vegetables and fruit at nearby markets. A single, skinny cow provided milk. Pigs were few, in the Beauvaisis, where they tended to compete with human beings for nourishment. Four or five chickens in the barnyard, a few sheep out to pasture with the communal herd, this was as much as the ordinary peasant family could afford. Add the meager wages earned in the winter months from spinning and weaving cloth, and the deficit could almost be made up, in a good year. In bad times, peasants could not pay their taxes. The time came, inevitably, when they had to borrow grain. These debts resulted, sooner or later, in the loss of a portion of their remaining land. Land-hungry and indebted, peasants faced the risk of losing their prized status in the community, of sinking to the level of the landless poor.93





As peasants and their landlords entered networks of entrepreneurial activity, both groups found their relationship with the land changing. For elite groups whose incomes came increasingly from commercial sources, in environments where ever greater amounts of agricultural produce were marketed, it was no longer vital to supply peasants with land. Because landlords now had sources of income that did not depend on peasant farming, they could, as in the extreme case of sixteenth-century England, replace peasants with sheep and still survive. As a result of such changes, states, landlords, and even some wealthier peasants began to see the land itself as a source of commercial profits rather than just a source of produce. In some countries, such as England, governments encouraged the commercialization of the land by abolishing or buying up ancient rights to it and expropriating tenants whose claims were merely customary. There, in the course of a mere three centuries (from 1500 to 1800), the expropriation of traditional peasant rights to the land through enclosures destroyed the traditional peasantry. Elsewhere, peasants were squeezed from the land by slower and sometimes more agonizing pressures of taxation, indebtedness, crop failure, and land shortage. Sometimes, as in postrevolutionary France, their rights to the land were protected, but commercial pressures ensured that to survive, they had to become petty entrepreneurs. Everywhere, commercialization, as it penetrated the countryside, turned the land into a commodity and turned peasants into wage earners or petty entrepreneurs. In this way, capitalism began to pervade all corners of rural life.

Commercialization of the land steepened the gradient of wealth, for it began to undermine the basic rule of agrarian civilizations: rural producers had to be provided with land. The analogy Marx used to describe the change was electrical. What he called the “primitive accumulation” of capitalism was, unlike the simpler, cumulative forms described in the previous chapter, a sort of social “electrolysis,” like the accumulation that occurs in a car battery. There, potential power is generated by the gravitation of one ion to the negative pole of a battery and of another ion to its positive pole.94 During primitive accumulation, property and wealth gravitated toward a property-owning class, while absence of property characterized an emerging class of proletarians. Particularly in its earlier stages, this was a painful and predatory process; primitive capitalism, like any novice predator (and like the earliest and simplest forms of tribute-taking), was at first more concerned to consume than to protect its prey.95 Yet, as Marx argued, the increased potential energy generated by this social electrolysis is what explains the dynamism of the capitalist system. Removing peasants from the land forced them to engage, decisively and permanently, in wage-earning activities. As wage earners, they found themselves competing with other wage earners, while as traditional peasants, their main goal had been sheer survival. As wage earners, the price they paid for inefficiency was dismissal and possible destitution; as peasants, it had merely been poverty because they still had some land to feed themselves from. So, as Marx claimed, driving peasants from the land was a crucial step in creating a world in which competition forced the bulk of the population to concern themselves, like merchants, with issues of efficiency and productivity. Like merchants, they had to buy and sell (because they could no longer produce their own food and clothing); and, like merchants, they had to work harder and harder just to survive in an increasingly competitive world. Marx used the notion of “absolute surplus value” to explain the increasing burden of work in the early history of capitalism. Recently, Jan de Vries has argued that in Europe at least, an “industrious revolution” preceded the more familiar “Industrial Revolution” of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.96

What remains uncertain is whether these processes had proceeded much further in western Europe than in many other parts of Afro-Eurasia. It is tempting to say that while most peasants were engaged in market activities of some kind by 1700, the region in which most had actually suffered land expropriation was western Europe, particularly Britain. Nevertheless, as recent research has shown, the differences are not clear enough to justify the claim that western Europe, or Britain, was now “capitalist,” whereas, say, China was not.





A WORLD RIPE FOR TRANSFORMATION?




This is a frustrating conclusion. The sudden creation of a global network of exchanges had transformed economic and social systems in many parts of the world. Though devastating the indigenous populations of other world zones, it had magnified the wealth concentrated in the more commercial regions of Afro-Eurasia. Both Afro-Eurasia and the Americas were integrated into global systems of exchange so that by 1700 the world was significantly more commercialized than it had been a few centuries earlier. In some regions, social structures now approximated more closely than ever before the ideal type of a capitalist economy. Rural producers were deeply implicated in entrepreneurial or wage-earning activities of some kind, and commercial activity was breaking down the traditional isolation of the village world. Furthermore, many other parts of the world outside the core areas of agrarian civilization were also enmeshed in networks of entrepreneurial activity. These included settler regions in North and South America and Siberia, as well as significant parts of Africa and, by the end of the eighteenth century, much of the Pacific and Australasia. Moreover, as in earlier periods, expansion in exchange networks and growth in populations, commercial activity, and state activity had stimulated major developments in some sectors of the economy, including commerce, mining, and warfare, as well as many smaller but highly significant innovations in agriculture (e.g., the introduction of new crops). Finally, and perhaps most important of all, the sheer size of the modern world system magnified the possibilities for commercial and intellectual synergy by increasing the volume of trade and the extent to which new goods and new ideas from one region could stimulate economic activity in other parts of the world system. In this huge, global arena, commercialization was not only more extensive; it was also more dynamic in its social, political, and economic effects. It is tempting to think that the world had attained the threshold of capitalism as Marx defined it: “an accumulation of use values sufficiently large to furnish the objective conditions not only for the production of the products or values required to reproduce or maintain living labor capacity, but also for the absorption of surplus labor.”97

Stimulated by the sudden emergence of a global exchange system, and a sudden increase in the volume, variety, and intensity of exchanges of many different kinds, the modern world system had approached the threshold of modernity—but had not yet crossed it. There are important respects in which the world in 1700 remained decisively premodern and precapitalist. Modernity is unthinkable without levels of agricultural productivity high enough to release a majority of producers from agricultural work. Yet nowhere in the world had such thresholds clearly been crossed by the early eighteenth century (though things looked rather different by the end of that century). England comes as close as any region to an exception, for there, by the late seventeenth century, a relatively entrepreneurial class of landlords controlled ca. 70 to 75 percent of all cultivable land, and 40 percent of the population was no longer in agricultural employment.98 But these figures also demonstrate that more than half of the population continued in agricultural employment of some kind, and about three-quarters of the population still lived in hamlets or villages.99 Even England remained primarily an agrarian country like all tributary societies for the previous 4,000 years, with ca. 50 percent of its population employed in agriculture as late as 1759.100 “What remains true,” observes Peter Mathias, “is that the greatest single flywheel of the economy was the land, the greatest source of wealth in rents, profits and wages, and the greatest single employer. Directly and indirectly much of industry depended upon the domestic harvest for its raw materials. The brewer, miller, leatherworker, chandler, weaver, even the blacksmith in village England were supporting and being supported by agriculture.”101 Elsewhere, the changes were considerably less noticeable; in France, for example, ca. 85 percent of the population may have been peasants, ca. 13 percent town dwellers, and ca. 1 percent nobles.102

The limits to social and economic changes before the eighteenth century explain the other striking aspect of the early modern era: the continued slowness, by modern standards, of innovation. As of 1700, it would be extremely hard for a visitor from another planet to have detected two of the most important features of the modern world: the dominant role of Europe and the accelerating rate of innovation.





SUMMARY




During two large Malthusian cycles, the first before the fourteenth century and the second between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, there was a sustained and accelerating increase in rates of accumulation in the major regions of agrarian civilization. Throughout these core regions commercialization also increased significantly, particularly after the emergence of a global network of exchanges in the sixteenth century. In some areas, such as Song China or Europe beginning in the sixteenth century, commercialization led to the emergence of polities committed more to commercial than to tributary forms of wealth. In short, in some regions there began to emerge what we can call capitalist states, and world markets as a whole were becoming much larger and more integrated.

Nevertheless, no revolutionary changes occurred in this period. In the eighteenth century, it would still have been appropriate to describe the dominant political structures of the emerging world system as tributary rather than capitalist. Despite the high levels of commercialization to be found in many areas, the most powerful governments remained traditional in their attitudes and their economic and social policies. Perhaps the clearest sign of this continuity with the past was that Asia remained the heartland of the world system—a fact that historians have only recently understood clearly.

Even in Europe, where commercialization had gone furthest in breaking down traditional political structures, it had a limited impact on how goods were produced in the countryside. Though capitalist structures dominated trading systems and shaped the policies of major states, they did not yet dominate production. As Charles Tilly has written, “Through most of history, indeed, capitalists have worked chiefly as merchants, entrepreneurs, and financiers, rather than as the direct organizers of production”103—an observation that remained true in 1700. Capitalism was transforming commerce, but it had not yet transformed methods of mass production. The basic unit of production remained the household: the peasant household on the farm or in domestic industries, and the artisan household in the towns. Though wages were increasingly important to them, these people were not yet wage laborers. Thus commercial methods and attitudes had not yet significantly affected production, which remained small-scale and traditional. Europe’s social structures also remained traditional in many ways, as can be seen most clearly in the dominance of agriculture and of the peasantry.

So, in the eighteenth century, there existed a global world system, in which traditional tributary structures were still dominant. However, all regions of this system were now highly commercialized as a result of a long and accelerating process of accumulation of knowledge and of resources, particularly commercial resources. Furthermore, in some regions, particularly in Europe, capitalist structures were powerful enough to dominate state structures and governmental policies, and some of these neo-capitalist state structures were powerful enough to militarily challenge major tributary states. This combination—a world system that was already highly commercialized, and some regions in which political structures were also being transformed—provided the preconditions for the rapid creation of an entire world system driven by the dynamic imperatives of capitalism.

The literature on world history in the last 1,000 years is huge and rich, but there is no consensus on many of the key issues.
