title: CHAPTER 11 APPROACHING MODERNITY
---






In the past thousand years, and particularly in the past two or three hundred years, a transformation more rapid and more fundamental than any other in human history has taken place. A new threshold was crossed, leading to a fundamentally new type of society. Anthony Giddens writes, “Over a period of, at most, no more than three hundred years, the rapidity, drama and reach of change have been incomparably greater than any previous historical transitions. The social order … initiated by the advent of modernity is not just an accentuation of previous trends of development. In a number of specifiable and quite fundamental respects, it is something new.”1 The change is not just important for humans; it is an event of planetary significance because the impact of humans on the biosphere has now taken on entirely new dimensions.2

Because we live in the middle of this transformation, it is hard to see its features clearly and objectively. So, in describing it, I will settle for a deliberately vague label: “the Modern Revolution.”





THE WORLD ON THE EVE OF MODERNITY




In order to grasp the scale and significance of the Modern Revolution, it may help to begin with an imaginary tour of the world on the eve of modernity, in the early centuries of the second millennium CE.

In Europe and the People without History (1982), Eric Wolf takes his reader on a tour of the world in 1400.3 This overview reminds us how much of the world was not yet incorporated in regions of agrarian civilizations even at that late date. Though they had steadily encroached on the lands of independent farmers, pastoralists, and even foragers, in 1000 CE agrarian civilizations still controlled less than 15 percent of the lands ruled by modern states. We therefore must not project back into the agrarian era the devastating impact that modern states have had on stateless communities in the past 500 years. In practice, stateless communities, including the peasant farmers of northern Europe or Manchuria, or the pastoralists of Mongolia or the Scythian steppes, could still pose severe military challenges to the mightiest of agrarian empires. At the same time, relations between different types of communities were shaped as much by exchanges as by conflict. Pastoral nomads exchanged horses and hides for city-produced silks or wines; Siberian foragers exchanged walrus tusks or furs for metal goods; and horticulturalists in the jungles of Central America or tropical Africa traded gold, feathers, jaguar skins, and slaves for city-produced goods of various kinds. Conversely, states from China to Rome needed the horses and the hired soldiers of the steppes; their merchants traded with and through the steppes, and with the forest zones beyond them. In the Americas, too, cities had to trade with or through regions controlled by communities without state structures, along trade routes that linked them with remote jungle communities.

Analytical categories encourage us to think of each lifeway as a world of its own, but as Wolf insists, this was never true: “Everywhere in this world of 1400, populations existed in interconnections. Groups that defined themselves as culturally distinct were linked by kinship or ceremonial allegiance; states expanded, incorporating other peoples into more encompassing political structures; elite groups succeeded one another, seizing control of agricultural populations and establishing new political and symbolic orders.”4

The elites of agrarian civilizations normally regarded those who lived beyond their borders (and many who lived within them) as “barbarians.” The barbarian communities included foragers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, and small-scale farmers, who often used seminomadic forms of swidden agriculture and still hunted and gathered some of their produce. Working within the networks linking these worlds were traders of various kinds—some ruthless and predatory, others more consensual in their methods. Most people still lived in small communities. Here, kinship was more important than state power. This was true even of the villagers who made up most of the populations and produced most of the resources of agrarian civilizations. Of course, villagers could not ignore the oppressive burden of landlords or tax gatherers, or the passage of armies that led so often to death, disease, or enslavement. But for most households, most of the time, the local communities of family, kin, and neighborhood were what counted.

In a vast frontierland reaching away from the regions of agrarian civilizations, there lived communities of farmers organized in villages, often under kin-based leaders. Some of these communities were on the verge of statehood. Much of the Amazon basin was populated by small communities of horticulturalists who also engaged in hunting and gathering. In North America, along the Mississippi River, farmers lived in dense communities structured almost like states. Some sites of the Mississippian culture, such as Cahokia, near St. Louis, may have contained more than 30,000 people. Cahokia was a huge political and ceremonial center, with some 100 earthen mounds. Elements of the Mississippian culture survived until the sixteenth century, though the major sites such as Cahokia had declined long before; and surviving communities were decimated by Eurasian diseases when first contacted by Europeans. But we have one recorded eyewitness account from a French explorer, Le Page du Pratz, who lived briefly among the Natchez tribes of the Mississippi valley. As Brian Fagan summarizes, “He found himself in a rigidly stratified society—divided into nobles and commoners and headed by a chieftain known as the Great Sun—whose members lived in a village of nine houses and a temple built on the summit of an earthen mound. Pratz witnessed the funeral of the Great Sun. His wives, relatives, and servants were drugged, then clubbed to accompany him in death.”5

Large communities of farmers could be found in much of western and central Africa as well. In some regions, such as those occupied by modern Zimbabwe, or the lands north of modern Ghana, high population densities and extensive trade networks supported state systems from the middle of the first millennium CE, or perhaps even earlier. The states of West Africa depended largely on their control of trade networks specializing in gold that crossed the Sahara and either reached the Mediterranean shores near modern Morocco or reached Egypt and the Islamic world. The states that emerged in central and East Africa traded with coastal cities whose Muslim merchants carried their goods (above all, gold and slaves) to the Islamic world and to South and Southeast Asia. In the fourteenth century, the Chinese fleets that sailed under the Muslim eunuch Zheng He reached the eastern shores of Africa. But even these expeditions were novel only insofar as they cut out the middlemen in ancient trading networks. There were African slaves in China from at least the seventh century CE, and, Wolf reports, “by 1119 most of the wealthy people of Canton were said to have possessed Black slaves.”6

Northern Europe also supplied slaves to neighboring agrarian civilizations, and until late in the first millennium CE, much of Europe remained a world of stateless farmers. Such regions, though lacking the large standing armies of agrarian empires, could prove dangerous to their “civilized” neighbors. This was particularly true where the wealth of neighboring agrarian civilizations prompted emulation and attempts at conquest. Gothic raiders founded a series of dynasties in the remains of the Roman Empire in the fifth and sixth centuries CE, while Manchurian dynasties created several states in North China from as early as the fourth century CE—including the last dynasty of premodern China, the Qing or “Manchu” (r. 1644–1911). Such conflicts often prompted the spread of state structures beyond the established frontiers of agrarian civilizations. In the middle of the first millennium CE, states began to appear throughout northern Europe. In eastern Europe, agricultural populations expanded rapidly and migrated into what is today Ukraine and Russia; thus, by the end of the millennium, states had also appeared in much of eastern Europe.

In the New World, too, agrarian civilizations were often threatened by neighboring “barbarians.” In Mesoamerica, several great cities, including Teotihuacán and Tula, suffered devastating raids from communities farther north, with whom they already had links of culture and trade. The career of the Aztecs parallels that of the Goths. Originally known as the Mexica, the ancestors of the Aztecs came from horticulturalist or foraging communities north of the Valley of Mexico whose worlds were influenced in many ways by the cultural heritage of central Mexico. From their homelands, the Aztecs moved into the Valley of Mexico, where they survived in marginal lands between the region’s major city-states. In the fourteenth century, they began to hire themselves as mercenary soldiers, until in 1428 they overthrew their masters and created a dynasty of their own.7 Large regions of stateless farming communities also flourished in much of Southeast Asia and on the borders of an expanding China. The most isolated communities of this kind could be found in the islands of Melanesia and Polynesia.

In Afro-Eurasia, there was another important type of frontier: between farming regions and regions of pastoralism. Pastoralists survived in lands too arid to support dense farming populations. These lands stretched from Mongolia through the steppes of Inner Eurasia and Iran, through to Mesopotamia and the Sahara, and south into East Africa.8 Pastoralism based mainly on horses, goats, sheep, and camels was the most widespread life-way throughout the arid steppelands and deserts of Eurasia. Camel pastoralism was particularly important in the heartland of Arabia and in the Sahara Desert. Much of central and eastern Africa was populated by large communities of cattle-herding pastoralists. Pastoralist communities normally consisted of kin-based groups organized in clans, tribes, and occasionally (particularly in times of widespread conflict) larger intertribal alliances. In times of peace, pastoralists traveled in small groups of a few households along established migration routes. They either erected tents at each new campsite or traveled in covered mobile homes. The Greek writer known as pseudo-Hippocrates described the wagons used by the Scythians north of the Black Sea more than 2,000 years ago: “The lighter wagons have four wheels but some have six, and they are fenced about with felt. They are built like houses, some with two divisions and some with three, and they are proof against rain, snow and wind. The wagons are drawn by two or three yokes of hornless oxen; hornless because of the cold. The women live in these wagons while the men ride on horseback, and they are followed by what herds they have, oxen and horses.”9

Everywhere, pastoralists had a significant impact on neighboring communities because their limited productivity and great mobility encouraged them to trade with agrarian or forager neighbors, while their virtuosity as warriors meant that raiding was often a profitable alternative to trade. Their raids provoked similar strategies of counterinvasion and wall building from North China to central Asia to the Balkans.10 The horse-riding pastoralists of the Inner Eurasian steppes created powerful military alliances from perhaps as early as the second millennium BCE. Because the steppes supported small populations, such alliances could turn into more durable structures only if they managed to extract large amounts of wealth from neighboring agrarian civilizations; the most powerful pastoralist armies thus appeared along trade routes or at the borders with agrarian neighbors. Some of these structures deserve the name of states, despite their differences from the states of the agrarian world. They were not products of pastoralism, agriculture, or trade but of a complex intertwining of these different life-ways.11 The best-known pastoralist empire is that of Genghis Khan. Created in the thirteenth century, in campaigns of conquest more spectacular and more durable than those of Alexander the Great, the Mongol Empire eventually controlled all of the Inner Eurasian steppelands, most of Iran, and all of China. It was the first political system to touch all major regions of Eurasia.

The frontiers between agrarian civilizations and pastoralism may have been the most active and complex of all frontier zones. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, we can see the powerful intellectual synergies that could be generated when communities with different technologies and lifeways regularly exchanged ideas, goods, and people. And such exchanges made these frontiers a powerful motor of innovation throughout the Afro-Eurasian world zone. Through them were transferred new technologies, including those of horse riding, metallurgy and warfare, as well as religious ideas from shamanism to Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. They also transmitted diseases, genes, and languages. Indo-European languages expanded, probably from somewhere in modern Russia, to the borders of China, to India, to Mesopotamia, and to Europe, carried by pastoralist migrants. The armies of agrarian civilizations often contained contingents of cavalry from the steppes. And sometimes pastoralist leaders, from the Parthians to the Seljuks and Moguls, set up successful dynasties in the borderlands and then moved into the citied heartlands.

Smaller and less powerful kin-based communities of foragers could be found in much of Siberia, along the shores of the Arctic, in parts of Africa, in much of North America, in much of the southern half of South America and the Amazon basin, and throughout Australia. Their lifeways varied greatly, and no generalizations can do justice to that variety. A verbal photograph of a single group will have to do here.

The Khanty and Mansi lived in western Siberia, east of the Urals Mountains. They spoke languages distantly related to modern Finnish and Hungarian. In the seventeenth century, as Muscovite traders and soldiers entered their territory, they probably numbered about 16,000 people. (The population of Muscovy at this time was about 10 million, a powerful reminder of the huge demographic difference between foraging and agrarian communities.) According to the accounts of Muscovite travelers, the Khanty and Mansi lived mainly by hunting and fishing. But they also borrowed techniques from neighbors. Some southern clans cultivated barley and herded cattle and horses, while some northern clans engaged in reindeer herding, like their neighbors the Samoyed. Their outer garments were made from reindeer and elk skins or furs, though some clans also used feathers or fish skins. In the south, some even wove cloth from vegetable fibers. Most Khanty and Mansi lived in semipermanent winter camps; in the summer they moved to hunting and fishing grounds, where they lived in birch-bark tents. They traveled the extensive rivers of their homelands using birch-bark canoes in warm weather and skis in winter. Though small in numbers, the Muscovites found them formidable military opponents, for they used metal armor, longbows, and iron spears.

The following account of their lifeways was recorded by a Muscovite ambassador to China in 1675. As with all accounts by literate travelers from agrarian civilizations, we learn from it almost as much about the attitudes of the writer as about the society being described:



All the Ostyaks [Khanty] catch great quantities of fish. Some eat it raw, others dry it and boil it, but they know neither salt nor bread, nothing but fish and a white root susak, of which they collect a supply in summer, dry it, and eat it in winter. Bread they cannot eat; or if any do eat their fill of it, they die. Their dwellings are yourts [i.e., yurts]; and they catch fish not merely for the sake of food, but to make themselves clothing out of the skins—also boots and hats, sewing them with sinews of the fish. They make use of the lightest possible boats, built out of wood, holding five or six men, and even more. They always carry with them bows and arrows, to be ready to fight at any moment. Wives they have in plenty—as many as they wish, so many do they keep.12





Like the Khanty and Mansi, many foraging communities had significant contacts with larger communities, with whom they exchanged technologies and goods of various kinds. Some systems of exchange were thousands of years old. These include the trades in arctic goods such as walrus tusks and precious furs that linked Siberian communities of foragers with communities of farmers or pastoralists to their west or south, and, indirectly, with the cities even farther south. In South America, the large agrarian populations of the western slopes of the Andes traded with stateless communities of the eastern slopes for prestige goods such as feathers, coca, and jaguar skins, or sought access to the gold of the Amazon basin through indirect systems of exchange that passed in relay through many different hands. Even some of the domesticated crops of western South America, such as sweet potato and peanuts, may have come from the tropical forests of the Amazon basin.13 Such trades sometimes enabled local chiefs to build up more powerful political systems than would have been possible otherwise. The military confederations that formed in the northeast of North America and in southeastern Canada during the eighteenth century were built on the weapons and the liquor traded inward from Europe in return for furs. But though at first such exchanges might have appeared quite equal, they were dangerous for indigenous communities in the long run. Fur lured the Russian state deep into Siberia, and French and British traders deep into North America and Canada, with immense and tragic consequences for the many communities of foragers and horticulturalists with whom they traded.

Even the remotest communities often had some contact with agrarian communities, or practiced minimal forms of domestication. Along the northwestern shores of Australia, in recent centuries, communities were visited periodically by traders from Sulawesi whose crews brought trade goods including glass, pottery, tobacco, and metalwares in return for the prized trepang, or sea cucumber. These they sold in Southeast Asia and China as a gastronomic delicacy and an aphrodisiac.

In these and many other ways, communities of farmers, pastoralists, and foragers within and beyond the borders of agrarian civilizations helped shape each others’ histories. But for most of the agrarian era, the balance of power between agrarian civilizations and other communities was much less uneven than it has been in the modern era. The ecological and cultural heterogeneity that could be found throughout the inhabited world in 1000 CE was one of the main casualties of the Modern Revolution.





THE MODERN REVOLUTION




Many features of the world described above had existed for millennia—yet most had vanished by 2000 CE. The world of the early twenty-first century is utterly different from the world of seven or eight hundred years ago. Indeed, the transformations caused by the Modern Revolution have been so all-embracing that it is hard to think of areas of life that they did not transform. What follows is little more than a checklist of some of the more important changes.





Population Growth




Population growth has accelerated sharply, as can be seen from a glance at figure 11.1 or table 11.1. In 1960, an attempt to calculate the mathematical tendency of global population in the past 2,000 years concluded that human populations would reach infinity on Friday, 13 November 2026.14 This calculation (which came to be known as the “doomsday equation”) is a reminder that such rates of growth cannot be sustained forever. In 1000 CE, the world’s population stood at about 250 million. At the end of the twentieth century, it had multiplied twenty-four times, to reach 6 billion. Most of this growth occurred in the second half of the second millennium. In 1500, world populations stood at about 460 million; in 1800, they stood at 950 million, or just under 1 billion; and by 1900, they had reached just over 1.6 billion. In the 800 years before 1800, populations increased by about four times, while in the two centuries after 1800, they multiplied by six times. As a result, the doubling time for world populations declined sharply, particularly in the past two centuries (see table 6.3). As table 11.1 shows, in the past two centuries, populations grew throughout the world.

The bloom of human populations revealed in table 11.1 will probably peak in the twenty-first century. Even so, it is a phenomenon of planetary significance, for it has affected the entire biosphere. Humans have become, as Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan put it, “a sort of mammalian weed.”15 Carlo Cipolla comments: “A biologist, looking at the diagram showing the recent growth of world population in a long-range perspective, said that he had the impression of being in the presence of the growth curve of a microbe population in a body suddenly struck by some infectious disease. The ‘bacillus’ man is taking over the world.”16 One large species, our own, has acquired a quite unprecedented capacity to divert the planet’s resources to its own uses. As we have seen, humans are currently co-opting at least a quarter of the energy that enters the biosphere through sunlight and photosynthesis (see p. 140). No wonder human population growth has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the number of other species.

Technological Virtuosity




Sustained population growth presupposes an increase in the resources available to feed, clothe, and sustain human populations. But growth this rapid requires more than just an increase in the available land; it also requires greater productivity, which implies increased rates of ecological and technological innovation. Thus rapid population growth has been accompanied by (indeed, made possible by) a dazzling display of technological virtuosity In the past two centuries, innovation has ceased to be sporadic and occasional; it has become general and pervasive. And there is no sign that this burst of innovation is ending. On the contrary, in the late twentieth century the rate of innovation was faster than ever.

New technologies have affected demographic trends directly, by improving the quality of medical knowledge and medical care and thereby enabling babies and adults to live longer. But their indirect impact has been even greater, for they sharply raised the productivity of both agriculture and industry. Productivity in agriculture has crossed the decisive threshold beyond which a minority on the land can support a majority off the land (see figure 9.3). In industrial production, changes have been even more spectacular. As David Landes puts it in an influential modern history of the Industrial Revolution:

TABLE 11.1. WORLD POPULATIONS BY REGION, 400 BCE-2000 CE





Improvements in productivity of the order of several thousand to one have been achieved in certain sectors—prime movers and spinning for example [e.g., compare horses with jumbo jets]. In other areas, gains have been less impressive only by comparison: of the order of hundreds to one in weaving, or iron smelting, or shoe-making. Some areas, to be sure, have seen relatively little change: it still takes about as much time to shave a man as it did in the eighteenth century.17





In textiles, which was perhaps the second most important sector of consumer goods production in the premodern world, traditional Indian hand spinners took about 50,000 hours to spin 100 pounds of cotton; the machinery invented in the eighteenth century in Britain lowered that figure to 300 hours by the 1790s, and it took a mere 135 hours by the 1830s.18 New technologies have also transformed methods of communication and information exchange, making it possible for modern networks of exchange to work more rapidly, more efficiently, and over greater areas than ever before. Whereas eighteenth-century messages traveled, at best, at the speed of horse-riding couriers or sailing ships, today the telephone and the Internet allow instantaneous communication by millions of people to any part of the world (see tables 10.3 and 10.4).

Perhaps most important of all, new technologies have enabled humans, as a species, to cross a fundamental ecological threshold by granting them access to vast and previously untapped sources of energy, far greater than those supplied by plants, animals, and other humans. No longer do human societies have to rely mainly on human or animal muscles or firewood, wind, and water to supply their energy needs. Instead of depending on these sources of recently captured solar energy, humans have begun to exploit the vast stores of ancient sunlight accumulated in coal, oil, and natural gas, which is why it makes sense to talk of a “fossil fuel revolution.” Learning how to use coal and oil to generate steam power or electricity has been the equivalent of finding several whole new continents for human exploitation. As Anthony Wrigley has argued, in Britain alone the energy extracted from coal ca. 1820 was equivalent to the amount of energy that could have been extracted using traditional technologies from an area of forest greater than all of Britain’s pasture and arable land taken together.19 Roughly speaking, the amounts of energy used by human societies increased by about five times in the nineteenth century, and then by another sixteen times in the twentieth century Even per person, the amounts of energy used increased by some four to five times in the twentieth century.20 John McNeill suggests that “we have probably deployed more energy since 1900 than in all of human history before 1900”21 (see table 6.1). All in all, the fossil fuels revolution offered an astonishing bonanza, multiplying by perhaps 100 times the total energy available to humans and making possible projects such as the transportation of grains halfway around the world—projects that were unthinkable earlier, because the needed technologies were unavailable and the energy costs would have been prohibitive. For a time, at least in the more industrialized countries, energy seemed more or less free. In this sense, the Modern Revolution was similar to other episodes in human history when a new resource has become available in such abundance that for a while it appears infinite. Just as land, game, and other resources undoubtedly seemed limitless when humans first entered the Americas or Australia or New Zealand, as did water when humans first began using irrigation on a large scale, or land and other resources when Europeans reentered the Americas and Australasia from the sixteenth century on, so too it was tempting in the era of steam, coal, and oil to think of fossil fuels as limitless and, effectively, free. In later as in earlier periods, the discovery of vast new resources often encouraged dangerously short-sighted methods of exploitation.





Increased Political and Military Power




Linked to these demographic and technological changes have been profound changes in social, political, and military structures. The sheer volume of resources produced by modern economies, together with the degree to which they are concentrated in the hands of minorities, means that while modern states dispose of much greater resources than premodern states, they also have to defend steeper gradients of wealth and face vastly more complex organizational challenges. Like dams, their size, strength, and complexity have to be commensurate to the volume of resources backed up behind them. Since the French Revolution, states throughout the world have acquired the ability to regulate the daily lives of their subjects in ways that were unthinkable in all earlier epochs. Indeed, the ability of modern states to keep their subjects within a tight mesh of legal and administrative rules helps explain why they resort less often to the terroristic methods of rule normal in the era of agrarian civilizations. But in addition to these new powers, modern states can inflict violence on a scale that is also unprecedented, for the productivity of weaponry has also increased rapidly—so rapidly that humans now have the power, if they choose, to destroy themselves and much of the biosphere within a few hours.





Transformed Life ways




Personal lives have been transformed. In the late agrarian era, most households lived in the countryside and engaged in small-scale farming. Today, small farming has vanished in many regions and is declining where it still survives. The small number of surviving foragers now live at the sufferance of states, often on marginal land; sooner or later they are all incorporated into modern economic and legal networks that undermine traditional cultural and economic structures. Pastoralism, too, has become marginal. Within just a few centuries, the Modern Revolution has destroyed or pushed to the margins lifeways that had flourished for thousands of years.

Instead of living on the land and producing their own food, which is what work meant for most humans throughout most of history, typical modern households live in urban environments where they earn incomes through some form of wage work and buy food produced by others. In the more industrialized economies, ca. 65 percent of populations lived in towns in 1980, and globally, ca. 38 percent; it is probable that even global levels of urbanization will cross the symbolic threshold of 50 percent early in the twenty-first century.22 In towns, the household remains a basic unit of consumption, but it has ceased to be a fundamental unit of production and the basic structure within which people are socialized. The mesh of kinship has been supplanted by the mesh of state regulation. In addition, new forms of contraception, new methods of child rearing, and new forms of education and public welfare have provoked a fundamental renegotiation of gender roles.

The meaning and texture of life have changed. In prosperous regions, better medical care has postponed death. Average life expectancies in the more affluent societies of the late twentieth century were perhaps double those typical in the more prosperous agrarian societies, and perhaps triple those of Stone Age societies. In the year 2000, a child born in Burkina Faso could expect to live for 44 to 45 years, a child born in India for 62 to 63 years, and a child born in the United States for 74 to 80 years (see table 14.4). In more affluent societies, moderns have access to a level of material wealth unimaginable in all earlier societies. On the other hand, by many standards moderns work harder than the peasants and foragers of earlier societies. And with the rise of a modern sense of clock time, they work increasingly to rhythms that are not their own.23 Furthermore, it is less clear what they are working for. Whereas those living in self-sufficient farming households or foraging bands knew perfectly well what the “meaning” of work was, because it was directly concerned with subsistence, the link is less direct for the highly specialized workers of modern businesses and corporations. For better or worse, the decline in kinship networks and traditional social roles has deprived people of the sharply defined identities that gave them a sense of purpose and place in many traditional societies. Huge movements of people, whether through the slave trade, mass migration, or forced displacement, have also deprived many of the sense of community known by their parents and grandparents.

In the most industrialized countries, personal relations are, on the whole, less violent today. In England, for example, modern murder rates are about those of 800 years ago, and 1/2 those of 300 years ago. This drop occurred because most modern states have disarmed their populations and assumed a monopoly on the use of violence. Charles Tilly notes, “Disarmament of the civilian population took place in many small steps: general seizures of weapons at the ends of rebellions, prohibitions of duels, controls over the production of weapons, introduction of licensing for private arms, restrictions on public displays of armed force.”24 But though they are on the whole less violent, personal relations in modern urban communities also lack the intimacy and continuity of those in most traditional societies. Increasingly, they are casual, anonymous, and fleeting. These changes may help explain the loss of a clear sense of values and meaning in modern lives, a subtle and disorienting alteration in the quality of modern life that the French sociologist Émile Durkheim referred to in the late nineteenth century as “anomie.”

The German sociologist Norbert Elias has argued that these changes have reached deep within our psyches, as modern forms of work and time discipline, enforced through the market, have shaped behavior in interpersonal relations, table manners, and attitudes toward sexuality. He has shown how the “emotional economy” typical in the modern world arises out of a relaxation of external restraints combined with an intensification of internal restraints: “The compulsions arising directly from the threat of weapons and physical force gradually diminish, and … those forms of dependency which lead to the regulation of the affects [feelings or emotions] in the form of self-control, gradually increase.”25 The internalization of new forms of discipline seems to be closely linked to new perceptions of time. As populations have grown, and as an ever greater proportion of people live in towns, the scheduling of daily activities has been geared increasingly to the activities of other humans rather than to the natural schedules of our own bodies, the seasons, and day and night. The growing influence of modern calendars and clocks and the emergence of conventions such as the international date line and local time zones based on Greenwich mean time (established in 1884) are the best index of these changes, for calendars and clocks provide a precise measure of social rather than ecological or psychic time. They therefore measure the extent to which humans had to adapt their behaviors and attitudes to a social rather than a natural ecology—to an ecology whose main elements were created by other human beings. The Modern Revolution has also given consumers access to a much broader range of mind-altering substances, in what David Courtwright has called the “Psychoactive Revolution.”26 These substances, ranging from opiates to coffee, tea, and sugar, have helped millions to cope with the sometimes harsh pressures and disciplines of modern life.





New Modes of Thought




The scientific modes of thought characteristic of modern society have generated both confidence and widespread alienation. Modern science has given humans unprecedented power over the natural world. But its universe is dominated by inanimate forces, a very different place from the rich world of spirits in which most people lived before the modern era. The ancient gods have been expelled, and the world of modern science is controlled by impersonal scientific laws. Gravity and the second law of thermodynamics now rule in the place of gods and demons. Scientific knowledge also lacks the specificity and sense of place of most premodern systems of knowledge, as it attempts to construct generalizations that work in all societies and all eras.27 Such a system of knowledge cannot offer the consolations or the moral guidance of traditional religions, even if it is much better at helping us to manipulate our material environment. But in a world with so many people, the trade-off is unavoidable. A system of knowledge that is good at manipulating the material world is exactly what we need. Without such knowledge, we could not possibly support a human population of 6 billion.





Acceleration




The speed of these transitions is itself a distinctive feature, for the pace of change has also increased. Indeed, this change is so decisive that it forces us to approach the Modern Revolution differently than all earlier revolutions. Unlike the transition to agriculture, which occurred, region by region, over several millennia, the Modern Revolution has been virtually instantaneous, lasting no more than two or three centuries. And it took place in a globally connected world, in which innovations spread so fast that there was little room for independent invention. At such high speed, the decisive thresholds could be crossed only once. This singularity gave a huge advantage to the regions that modernized first and ensured that most other communities would experience the transition to modernity as a violent imposition of new norms from outside, a brutal social tornado over which they had little control. The rapid transmission of change explains why the forms taken by the Modern Revolution were influenced so much by the cultures of one part of the world, Europe. Yet if Europe had not been first, we can be sure that other parts of the world would soon have crossed the same threshold.





THEORIES OF MODERNITY




How can we explain these astonishing transformations? There is as yet no consensus about the nature of the Modern Revolution, or about its causes. A century of detailed historical research has generated a colossal fund of information about modern history, particularly in Europe and North America, but no single theory of the rise of modernity has achieved general acceptance. The difficulties caused by lack of consensus and the sheer volume of information and ideas are compounded by the fact that we are still living through the Modern Revolution. We do not know its overall shape; perhaps in a few centuries’ time it will be apparent that the transformations had barely begun by 2000 CE. Even our most general definitions of the Modern Revolution may turn out to have been grossly misleading.

A book such as this cannot “solve” the problem of modernity. But we do have to try to see what this revolution looks like on the scale of big history, and from the point of view of the early twenty-first century. If there is anything distinctive about the argument that follows, it is that it views the Modern Revolution in the large context of human and even planetary history, rather than just as a problem about recent centuries and particular regions of the world. Its perspective is therefore global—a feature that sets it apart from many standard accounts. All too often, accounts of the Modern Revolution start from the (usually unstated) assumption that modernity was created in and by European societies; they thus imply that explaining modernity means looking at European history. Unfortunately, the assumption of European “exceptionalism” has discouraged the careful comparative analysis needed to check whether these arguments really work.28 If modernity is, as I will argue, a global phenomenon, a Eurocentric approach is bound to mislead us. More recently, historians interested in world history have tried to see modernity as a global problem that requires a global explanation.29 The account that follows does not ignore the distinctive role of Europe and the Atlantic world in the Modern Revolution, but it is constructed within the parameters of world history and focuses on the global aspects of the problem.





Population Growth and Rates of Innovation




To clarify some of the problems faced in trying to explain the Modern Revolution, I will take the methodological gamble of beginning with population growth. I will argue that if we can explain the astonishing bloom of human populations in the last two or three centuries, we should also be able to explain many other aspects of the Modern Revolution. But an explanation of population growth leads us rapidly to the problem of innovation. Rapid and sustained population growth must imply an acceleration in rates of innovation. Thus changing rates of innovation must be at the heart of any explanation of the Modern Revolution. As Joel Mokyr argues, “Technological change … accounted for sustained growth. It was not caused by economic growth, it caused it.”30

The problem, then, is to explain a sharp and global acceleration in innovation, which is the key to the Modern Revolution. We have seen that accelerating innovation is in some sense implicit in the notion of collective learning, so the Modern Revolution really represents a gear shift in the pace of collective learning in the last two centuries. As Daniel Headrick writes: “Knowledge is both cause and effect of economic growth, and the information industry has been the primary cause of the acceleration of technological change in the past 200 years.”31 We have seen some of the mechanisms that accelerated or retarded rates of innovation in previous eras and in different parts of the world, among them the size and variety of exchange networks and the intensity of exchanges within those networks. They also include population growth itself, which not only increases the size of exchange networks but also exerts a more or less gentle pressure to raise productivity in regions of high population density. In the era of agrarian civilizations, states and commercial exchanges acted as new sources of innovation. But they could also inhibit growth, as could population pressure when it led to overpopulation or the spread of disease. As a result, these pressures, even in combination, could never generate rates of innovation rapid enough to match potential rates of population growth. Hence there were periodic famines and Malthusian cycles that shaped the basic rhythms of human history in the era of agrarian civilizations.

The most striking feature of innovation in the past two centuries is that for a time at least, it has been so rapid and so sustained that levels of productivity have kept pace with and in some respects outpaced population growth. In fact, as we will see later, the large-scale rhythms of modern history are shaped less by Malthusian cycles, which were a result of insufficient productivity, than by business cycles, which are generated by over production. Of course, there have been many, sometimes devastating, regional famines; but on a global scale, food production has more than kept pace with population growth, which is precisely why populations have risen so fast. And what is true of food production is also true of production in other areas, from clothing and housing to consumer goods to energy and weaponry. It is this sharp global acceleration in the pace of collective learning, in rates of innovation, and in levels of productivity that we need to explain.





Some Possible Prime Movers




We can clarify the options by listing some of the prime movers that have been offered in existing attempts to explain the Modern Revolution. The rich tradition of scholarly debate on the Modern Revolution has yielded several promising candidates.32 Usually, these have been used to lever Europe into the modern world. But in principle, they should work equally well on a global scale.

Demographic Theories Demographic theories (often associated with the work of Ester Boserup) rely largely on population pressure to explain increased rates of innovation.33 We have seen that population growth exerted pressure to innovate throughout the agrarian era. And it is true that when combined with increasing commercialization, population growth sometimes acted as a stimulus by increasing the supply of labor and by increasing demand. For example, in eighteenth-century Britain, increasing demand for timber for fuel, building, and manufacturing led to deforestation, which in turn created pressure to find improved ways of using alternative fuels. And some of the key inventions of the British Industrial Revolution, including the invention of the coal-fired steam engine and methods of manufacturing iron using charcoal rather than wood, can be seen as responses to this pressure.

Nevertheless, population pressure on its own can explain only a small part of the sudden acceleration in growth rates characteristic of the modern era. The trouble is that all too often, population pressure has not generated the necessary innovations, and people have consequently starved or done without. After all, Great Britain was not the only country short of wood, and the problem may have been even worse elsewhere—in China, for example.34 Necessity is not always the mother of invention.

Geographical Theories Geographical theories rely heavily on particular geographical features to explain rising rates of innovation. For example, during the Industrial Revolution, Britain was able to replace timber with coal only because it had abundant and accessible reserves of that fuel. In the hands of E. A. Wrigley, such observations have been used to support an argument that focuses on “contingent” geographical factors to explain the distinctive role of Europe in the Modern Revolution.35 Several regions of the world, such theorists point out, had large populations and high levels of productivity and commercialization; so it may have been geographical accidents such as the location of coal or the relative closeness of the Americas that best explain the different trajectories of Europe and, say, China, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Geographical features of this kind are undoubtedly important, and they will play an important role in the account offered below, but on their own they cannot explain much, simply because they were always there. Opportunities for change do not guarantee that change will occur. Indeed, in Britain iron makers had tried to use coal for almost two centuries before Abraham Darby showed them how to use coke in the early eighteenth century. As Mokyr argues, geographical factors of this kind may shape change, but they are not a fundamental cause of change.36 What we must explain is why geographical factors such as the presence of coal suddenly began to be exploited more effectively, an effort that encourages us to look for distinctive features in the intellectual, economic, or social history of modern industrial societies.

Idealist Theories A third group of theories can be described as idealist. They argue that rates of innovation are affected by different ways of thinking. The simplest theories of this type explain the Modern Revolution as the outcome of a sustained wave of new inventions. T. S. Ashton caricatured this approach in his summary of the typical school essay on the subject: “About 1760 a wave of gadgets swept over England.”37 Of course, in a simple sense, such theories are correct. The number of innovations increased, and each particular innovation did help raise the general level of productivity. But the difficulty even with sophisticated versions of this approach, including Ashton’s own account,38 is that they cannot explain why the rate of innovation should have increased as and when it did. Why so many innovations? Why such interest in more productive or efficient technologies and material techniques? Why then, and why there?

Subtler idealist theories have suggested that deeper changes in attitudes and methods of thinking stimulated new commercial and technological methods. The most famous example of this approach (one that its author later retracted, at least in part) is Max Weber’s thesis about the connection between Protestantism and capitalism, first published in 1904–05. He argued that Protestantism, unlike Catholicism, embodied a new ethic of hard work, saving, and rationality that encouraged entrepreneurs to save and innovate in new ways.39 But such theories are difficult to handle. Religions are not monoliths: like all systems of thought, they are complex, multifaceted, and malleable enough to adapt to many different environments. At different periods of their history, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, and even Catholicism have all encouraged at least some of the qualities that Weber associated with Protestantism and capitalism. “Freedom” (particularly for entrepreneurs) has often been included as a significant prime mover of innovation; so has the “rise of science.” But for these arguments, too, the problem is to explain why and how those particular factors suddenly acquired such salience.40 Even the most subtle idealist theories have difficulty explaining why attitudes should have changed so decisively at a particular period in human history If Protestantism led to science or rationality or modernity, what led to Protestantism? Changing attitudes are certainly an important part of the explanation for rising rates of innovation, but they are symptoms of something deeper, not independent motors of change.

Commercial Theories A fourth cluster of theories focuses on the role of commercial exchanges. Economic historians, working in a tradition that goes back at least to the writings of Adam Smith, have highlighted the role of expanding networks of commercial exchange. Smith argued that rates of innovation were directly related to levels of commercialization. He begins chapter 1 of The Wealth of Nations (1776): “The greatest improvement in the productive power of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.” In other words, increased specialization raised productivity But Smith explained increasing specialization as itself a consequence of the rise of the market. Chapter 2 begins, “This division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not originally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.”41 As networks of exchange expand, cheap imports will undercut more expensive local producers and force them either to become more specialized, so that they in turn can produce more efficiently, or to focus on other products that they can produce more efficiently. In this way, wide networks of exchange ensure that the most productive methods soon become the best practice. Besides, where markets are extensive, people can afford to specialize more narrowly, for they will have enough customers to support them entirely from their specialized crafts (see figure 11.2). Chapter 3 of The Wealth of Nations explains the link between markets and the division of labor in its title: “That the Division of Labour Is Limited by the Extent of the Market.” In other words, expanding networks of exchange encouraged specialization, which stimulated innovation in productive techniques—a type of growth we can refer to as Smithian.42





Figure 11.2. An eighteenth-century pin factory. Adam Smith used the pin factory as an example of the advantages of the division of labor. From Joel Mokyr, The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 78: from René-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur, L’art de l’épinglier (1762).



As the previous chapter has argued, there clearly is a deep link between the expansion of trade networks, increased specialization, and increased rates of innovation. By and large, commercial activity (that is, the generation of revenues through relatively consensual exchanges in which coercion is not the paramount factor) tends to encourage innovation more than does tribute-taking (the generation of revenues through exchanges dominated by the threat of coercion), because those generating commercial incomes have to make up in efficiency for what they lack in coercive power. But we have seen that there are many exceptions to this rule; tribute takers are sometimes interested in efficiency-raising innovations, while merchants have never been averse to using force when they can get away with it. Moreover, the very nature of most premodern states suggests that as a general rule, in agrarian civilizations tribute-taking generated more wealth and certainly more power than commercial exchanges. This differential helps us understand what might at first appear puzzling: though commercial networks are as old as agrarian civilization, their impact on rates of innovation has been limited until the past two or three centuries. Why, then, did commercial exchanges suddenly become so much more significant in the modern era? Did they reach some critical threshold? If so, can we describe it? Or did some other factor suddenly increase their significance? To explain modernity, we have to explain how and why the role and significance of markets have changed in recent centuries.

One common approach (often associated with idealist theories of modernity) has been to argue that Europe was unusually commercial, and European markets were unusually vigorous. The trouble with arguments of this kind is that recent research has shown that as late as the end of the eighteenth century, general levels of commercialization and even overall productivity were probably as high in China, Japan, and northern India as in Europe, yet only in the Atlantic world did rates of innovation begin to rise rapidly in the nineteenth century. Andre Gunder Frank has recently argued that Asian economies had the largest populations, and the largest and most productive economies perhaps as late as 1750 or even 1800. Indeed, he maintains that per capita incomes in China may have been higher than those of Europe as late as 1800.43

Social Structure Theories However, downplaying European exceptionalism makes it extremely difficult to explain the different trajectories of these regions in the nineteenth century. An answer that has played a significant role in these debates since at least the time of Karl Marx is that even if western Europe does not stand out in 1800 from a Smithian perspective, it is remarkable from an institutional and social perspective. This idea is typical of a fifth possible approach to explaining the surge in rates of innovation. Social structure theories argue that different social structures affect rates of innovation in different ways. In general, they attempt to explain how the productivity-raising capacity of commerce may be transformed as powerful social groups become dependent on commercial rather than tributary exchanges of various kinds. In earlier chapters, I have already made some use of arguments of this kind to suggest why rates of innovation tended to be low in kin-ordered societies, and why the structures of tributary states did encourage innovation, but ambiguously and hesitantly. A social structure account of modernity must demonstrate that new social structures emerged that gave a much more powerful stimulus to innovation. Such theories owe much to Marx, who called the social structure characteristic of modernity “capitalism.” In his highly formal argument, Marx contended in Capital that the generalization of exchanges that is typical of capitalism encourages a new and especially powerful technological synergy, whose properties he analyzed in great detail. The simplified account that follows draws on Eric Wolf’s modified version of Marx’s scheme of “modes of production.”44

Marx’s thought is currently unfashionable; indeed, some have claimed it has been “refuted” by the collapse of socialism in the 1980s, and certainly much of it is dated today. Nevertheless, like Anthony Giddens, I believe that Marx’s analysis of capitalism “remains the necessary core of any attempt to come to terms with the massive transformations that have swept through the world since the eighteenth century.”45 In the writings of Marx, each “mode of production” characterizes a type of society in which particular life-ways and technologies are associated with particular social structures. We have already used Eric Wolf’s model of the kin-ordered and tribute-taking modes of production. Here, we must look more closely at the capitalist mode of production. As an ideal type, it has three main elements: (a) a dominant class of entrepreneurs or “capitalists” who own productive resources (i.e., capital) and use them to generate commercial profits that sustain their elite lifeways; (b) a class of people who, unlike peasants, have no access to productive property and can therefore support themselves only by selling their own labor power, thereby becoming wage earners or “proletarians”; and (c) competitive markets that link these two groups through commercial exchanges governed by market forces rather than by legal or physical coercion. In an idealized capitalist world, elite groups consist mainly of capitalists, the rest of the population consists mainly of proletarians, and most exchanges pass through markets.

By definition, wealth in such a world is distributed more unevenly than in the tributary world, for most proletarians do not have direct access to productive resources such as land. Speaking generally, it is the steepness of this gradient of wealth that accounts for capitalism’s remarkable dynamism, just as the large temperature gradient between the Sun and the space surrounding it drives complex processes on Earth. The large inequalities of capitalism help explain why resources no longer have to be moved primarily by the crude use (or threat) of physical violence as in tributary societies. Instead, states exert force mainly to maintain the structures of law and ownership that protect the concentration of wealth. It is the steepness of the gradient that drives wealth so efficiently through capitalist societies and that helps explain why, paradoxically, modern states have to be so much larger and more complex than the states of the tributary world.

Why should such structures encourage innovation? The point of the argument is that both main classes of society find themselves in environments that force them to innovate, constantly and endlessly. Just as ecological changes force species to evolve rapidly in periods of rapid environmental change such as the ice ages, so the new and constantly changing social ecology of capitalism forces humans of all classes to adapt by continually seeking more productive ways of working. In this way, the structures of capitalism led to the evolution of new behaviors that mobilized the innovative capacity of human beings in revolutionary ways.

At this point, Marx’s argument differs little from that of orthodox economists. In a world of entrepreneurs, competitive markets, and wage earners, both entrepreneurs and wage earners have to pursue innovation as a condition of survival. Entrepreneurs have to do so because in competitive markets the most successful long-term strategy will always be to cut the costs of production, and therefore of sale, and implementing such a strategy requires introducing cost-cutting innovations in production, transportation, and management. Like evolution in the nonhuman world, the process is endless because competitors will rapidly copy successful innovators, making entrepreneurial innovation general, constant, and accelerating.

Wage earners also have to actively seek ways of improving productivity. As sellers of labor power, they compete with other wage earners. To find purchasers for their labor power, wage earners have to offer labor that is more productive than that of potential rivals but costs less. Here, too, the ratchet of competition ensures that the productivity of labor will steadily increase. These rules explain the odd paradox that what Leon Trotsky called the “economic lash” of capitalism—the threat of unemployment—is a far more effective tool for increasing labor productivity than the lash of slavery or serfdom. Owners cannot afford to starve their slaves or serfs, but they have no incentive to give them a high standard of living. Such a system cannot stimulate the creativity of the worker. However, capitalist employers do not own their workers and have no need to protect them from starvation or poverty. In fact, they will generally regard the threat of unemployment or poverty as a healthy stimulus to harder work. So the onus is on the workers to ensure that their labor is productive enough to find a buyer. In this way, the economic lash can stimulate genuine, even creative, self-discipline, whereas the overseer’s whip can generate no more than grudging conformity. Capitalism generates a discipline that touches the intellect, the psyche, and the bodies of wageworkers with a power unattainable through the more direct and brutal methods typical of tributary societies. It is as if the structures of capitalism forced people to load new types of software into their brains. Or, to adopt a less rigid metaphor, it is as if the structures of capitalism filled people’s heads with quite new types of motivations and meanings (or “memes,” in the language of Richard Dawkins).46

This is a model of a society in which innovation is never-ending, because both main classes of society find themselves on a relentless treadmill of constantly rising productivity. Social structure theories of modernity imply that if we can explain how and why modern societies began to conform to this ideal type, we will have gone far toward explaining the Modern Revolution.

But here, too, there is a difficulty. Recent research has suggested that it is not as easy as it once seemed to distinguish between a capitalist Europe and a noncapitalist China or India. In much of East Asia, wage earning was widespread, and so was capitalist production. Indeed, two thorough comparative studies, by Kenneth Pomeranz and R. Bin Wong, have shown that levels of capitalist development in China and western Europe were so similar that it is no longer possible to explain the Industrial Revolution simply by referring to Europe’s higher levels of capitalism.47 In fact, the likenesses are so close that both authors leave us with the impression that the move to accelerated growth, which was to prove critical in the history of the modern era, turned on a few contingent differences, such as the distribution of coal.

In the next two chapters, I will attempt an explanation of modern rates of innovation that introduces many of these different prime movers but adds one more.

The Scale and Synergy of Exchange Networks In chapter 7, I argued that on large scales, rates of innovation were shaped by the size and heterogeneity of information networks. In other words, the sheer scale and variety of interactions may have been a powerful determinant of changing rates of innovation. In chapters 12 and 13, I will argue that the sudden increase in the scale and, perhaps even more important, in the variety of information exchanges in the early modern period may have given a sharp stimulus to processes of collective learning, particularly in hub regions where these exchanges were most concentrated and most diverse. But I will integrate this suggestion into an argument that also makes use of many of the other prime movers familiar in the literature on the rise of modernity. First, I will describe some of the factors that led to accelerating rates of innovation in general. Second, I will explain why the acceleration first became apparent in Europe. It might help to preview this argument somewhat schematically.

• A global explanation of rising rates of innovation

Accumulation. Particularly in the Afro-Eurasian zone, processes of accumulation over several thousand years had created several regions in which innovation had proceeded about as far as it could have gone within the traditional tributary framework of the era of agrarian civilizations. By the eighteenth century, these regions included China, Japan, parts of India, and parts of western Europe.48



Expanding networks of exchange. The creation of a global system of exchanges from the sixteenth century on gave a sudden and decisive boost to global processes of collective learning and commercialization. Expanded networks of information exchange opened new possibilities for innovation that helped break through the technological ceiling reached in the most densely populated regions of the world. As a result of this change, the amount and variety of information being exchanged increased sharply, and so did the speed with which it circulated, leading to a marked expansion in the pool of knowledge that could be drawn on by societies throughout the world. Increased commercial exchanges also boosted commercial activity, thereby accelerating the processes of innovation familiar from both Smithian and Marxist accounts of modernity.



An explanation of Europe’s distinctive role in the Modern Revolution



A new topology of exchange. A small number of societies were well placed geographically to benefit from the sudden acceleration in global processes of collective learning. The emergence of a global system of information exchanges transformed the topology of large-scale exchange networks. The Atlantic coasts of the Eurasian landmass, which had been at the periphery of Afro-Eurasian exchange networks, suddenly found themselves at the hub of new, global networks of exchanges. Europe, and then the Atlantic shores of North America, emerged as the first hub of a new world system, even if the center of gravity of that system remained for a long time in India and China. The volume of exchanges remained greatest in East Asia until well into the nineteenth century, but a greater variety of ideas, goods, wealth, and technologies began to flow through Europe and the Atlantic zone.49 This rearranged topology granted western Europe both a commercial and an intellectual windfall. At the same time, Mesopotamia, which had been the hub of Eurasian exchange networks for millennia, suddenly found itself less central within the new system of global exchanges. These rapid changes in the topology of global exchange networks gave Europe significant advantages.50 Seen in this light, modernity is not something that began in Europe and spread to other parts of the world; rather, it is a product of global processes, which cast the lands bordering on the Atlantic in a quite novel role.



European preadaptations. But why was Europe so well able to exploit these unexpected advantages? Because Europe alone enjoyed both a central position within the newly emerging world system and a high level of commercialization. Europe’s advantages were not just a matter of geographical good fortune. On the contrary, western European societies were, in an important sense, preadapted to exploit the opportunities created within new, global exchange networks. The social, political, and economic structures of many regions of western Europe helped Europe take advantage of the new systems of exchange that appeared with the emergence of a global network of exchanges, and it is at this point that I will return to arguments of a more familiar type about some of the distinctive features of European history. As Wong has put it, in his important study comparing China and western Europe in the early modern era: “European political economy did not create industrialization, nor was the European political economy deliberately designed to promote industrialization. Instead, European political economy created a set of institutions able to promote industrialization once it appeared.”51





SUMMARY




The world has been transformed in the past two or three centuries. Explaining that transition will be the task of the next two chapters, using the strategy described in this chapter. I focus on population growth, in the hope that a successful explanation of the astonishing population growth of modern times may also help make clear many other aspects of modernity Such an account will have to explain why and how humans have learned to extract from their environment the huge resources needed to support populations of several billions. This means explaining the astonishing increases in innovation and productivity typical of the modern world.

There have been many attempts to explain the revolutionary increases in innovation that are the key to the Modern Revolution. Each focuses on a different explanatory prime mover—population pressure, geographical factors, changing ideas, the expansion of markets and networks of exchange, changes in social structures, and so on. The account of the Modern Revolution offered in the next few chapters will make use of several of these elements, though it will focus mainly on the changing topology of networks of exchange and on changes in social structures. I will argue that the emergence of a global network of exchanges hugely stimulated commercial activity and ecological innovation throughout the world. The enhanced scale of information exchanges in a global information network boosted rates of ecological innovation, while increased commercial exchanges accelerated the sorts of innovation identified in Smithian and Marxist models of modernity. Within the global system, Europe appeared, quite suddenly, as a new hub region, so it was particularly well placed to exploit the huge commercial opportunities created in the new global system. But I will also argue that the social and economic institutions of Europe helped it take advantage of its fortunate location within the new global network of exchanges.





FURTHER READING




J. L. Anderson’s Explaining Long-Term Economic Change (1991) is a useful introduction to the theoretical literature. Among the more important recent studies are Anthony Giddens, A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism (2nd ed., 1995); Joel Mokyr, The Lever of Riches (1990); and E. A. Wrigley, Continuity, Chance, and Change (1988) and People, Cities, and Wealth (1987). E. L. Jones’s The European Miracle (1987) and Growth Recurring (1988) are classics that have stimulated much debate on the rise of the modern world. Andre Gunder Frank, ReOrient (1998); Kenneth Pomeranz, The Great Divergence (2000); and R. Bin Wong, China Transformed (1997), have reminded us powerfully of the relative backwardness and weakness of Europe before 1800, thereby undercutting the once-popular theories that traced modernity to medieval Europe. These works demonstrate the extent to which the Modern Revolution was the product of global processes. Margaret Jacob, The Cultural Meaning of the Scientific Revolution (1998), has been immensely influential in suggesting the importance of the scientific revolution for explaining the rise of modernity in Europe; Charles Tilly, Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992 (rev. ed., 1992), is the most thorough general account of the modernization of the European state system. Eric Wolf, Europe and the People without History (1982), reminds us of the crucial role played in modern history by peoples without state structures. Beyond these books, there is a vast literature on particular aspects of “the rise of the modern world,” some of which will be listed at the end of the next two chapters.
