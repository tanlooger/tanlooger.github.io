title: CHAPTER 14 THE GREAT ACCELERATION OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
---




If I had to sum up the twentieth century, I would say that it raised the greatest hopes ever conceived by humanity, and destroyed all illusions and ideals.





ACCELERATION




The twentieth century is so close to us that we may think we understand it. But in some ways, it is harder to grasp than any other epoch discussed in this book. Of all periods of human history, the twentieth century may be the most difficult to see in the large perspective of big history. We cannot know what will stand out a few centuries into the future. In Eric Hobsbawm’s superb history of the “short” twentieth century, The Age of Extremes (1994), the things that loom large are the world wars of the first half of the century, the Great Depression, the Communist experiment, decolonization, and, above all, the long boom after the Second World War. But on the scale of big history, other aspects of the twentieth century stand out. Most striking are the astonishing changes that have occurred in the relationship between human beings and the biosphere. In a recent environmental history of the twentieth century, John McNeill has argued that “the human race, without intending anything of the sort, has undertaken a gigantic uncontrolled experiment on the earth. In time, I think, this will appear as the most important aspect of twentieth-century history, more so than World War II, the communist enterprise, the rise of mass literacy, the spread of democracy, or the growing emancipation of women.”1

This chapter will focus on the sharp acceleration in the pace and scale of change in the twentieth century. Not until the twentieth century did the full significance of the Modern Revolution begin to reveal itself. Change accelerated so rapidly, and the ramifications of change were so universal, that this period marks an utterly new stage in human history and in the history of human relations with other species and with the earth. Indeed, it may be no exaggeration to say that the twentieth century marks a decisive moment in the history of the entire biosphere.

On the cosmological scale, changes mostly occur at the stately pace of millions or even billions of years. In the biological realm, where natural selection sets the pace, significant alterations take place on scales ranging from thousands to millions of years. In human history, shaped increasingly by cultural change, the pace is more rapid. In the Paleolithic era, significant changes took many thousands of years. Agricultural societies, with their greater demographic dynamism, reduced that scale so that the entire history of agrarian societies could fit into a mere ten thousand years, while the history of agrarian civilizations was only half as long. The extraordinary dynamism of the Modern Revolution has accelerated the pace of global historical change once more. Time itself seems to have been compressed in the twentieth century.

Our sense of space has been revolutionized as well by modern forms of transportation and communication, from air travel to the Internet. It is not just that telescopes can reach nearly to the edge of the universe and the beginnings of time. Within the compass of human society, information and money can now be transferred more or less instantaneously across the globe, while people can travel only slightly less rapidly. Collective learning now embraces the world, but on the timescales of a private conversation. Robert Wright observes, “The fitful but relentless tendency of invisible social brains to hook up with each other, and eventually submerge themselves into a larger brain, is a central theme of history. The culmination of that process—the construction of a single, planetary brain—is what we are witnessing today, with all its disruptive yet ultimately integrative effects.”2 Space has contracted as rapidly as time. The epidemiologist D. J. Bradley has illustrated vividly what these changes mean for the life experience of individuals by plotting the “life-time travel tracks” of four generations of males in his own family. His great-grandfather’s lifetime travel track could be contained within a square whose sides were only 40 kilometers long. In each of the next three generations, the sides of this square multiplied by about ten times. The lifetime travel track of his grandfather occupied a square with sides about 400 kilometers long, while that of his father had sides at least 4,000 kilometers long, and Bradley’s own travels covered the entire globe.3

In 1940 the German cultural critic Walter Benjamin offered a haunting image of the hurricane of change that human societies have experienced in the twentieth century:



A Klee painting named “Angelus Novus” shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.4





As Eric Hobsbawm has argued, this hurricane of change has threatened to cut us loose from the past so decisively that it has transformed how we think about history itself.5

On many important scales, more change has occurred in the twentieth century than in all earlier periods of human history. The fact that this chapter covers only one century, while the equivalent chapter on the era of agrarian civilizations (chapter 10) covers four millennia, is merely one index of the transformations of scale engineered by modern society.

In describing these changes, it makes sense, once again, to begin with population growth, for whatever the impact of other factors, such as new technologies and new forms of social organization, every increase in human populations inevitably places new demands on the earth’s resources (see table 14.1).6 In 1900, world populations stood at about 1.6 billion. A century later, they had quadrupled to about 6 billion. It took 100,000 years for human populations to reach the first billion, and just over a century to add another five. In this century, the doubling time for human populations fell to eighty years in the first half of the century, and to a mere forty in the second half.





CHANGES WITHIN HUMAN SOCIETY





Waves of Innovation in the Twentieth Century




The acceleration of technological change was the primary agent of transformation. In the first place, technological changes are what made it possible to support such huge populations. A thoroughly commercialized agriculture had appeared in northwestern Europe by the eighteenth century, but the most significant increases in agricultural productivity have occurred in the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 2000, the productivity of the world’s croplands has increased by three times, and the total grain harvest has multiplied five times, from 400 million to almost 2 billion tons.7 Agricultural output rose faster than populations in the twentieth century. Increased food production depended partly on the increased use of an old technology, irrigation, and on the continued exchange of crops such as maize and soybeans between different parts of the world. But new techniques were also crucial. Particularly important were the use of artificial fertilizers and the systematic breeding of new strains of crops, the most important of which have been varieties of high-yield cereals and hybrid corns.

Outside agriculture, the most important technological changes of the twentieth century came in waves whose impact and size dwarfed those of the nineteenth century.8 A fourth wave of innovation began at the end of the nineteenth century and lasted for much of the first half of the twentieth century. The internal combustion engine, whether installed in cars, trucks, tanks, or planes, was the crucial new technology, and oil was the vital energy source, though other fossil fuels (including coal and natural gas) were also important. In this phase, large, multidivisional corporations based in the most industrialized countries began to break out of the national framework in which they had evolved, turning into multinational corporations, with operations in several different countries.9 The appearance of multi national corporations was one expression of the increasing dominance of the most highly industrialized countries. The geographical spread of industrialization slowed in this period, and the productive capacity of those regions that had already begun to industrialize soared ahead of that of the rest of the world. Paul Bairoch’s calculations (see tables 13.1 and 13.2) suggest that the absolute as well as the relative industrial output of regions beyond the emerging industrial heartland was falling for almost a century, from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.

A fifth wave of innovation, after the Second World War, was dominated by atomic power and electronics. Electronics raised the efficiency of many other technologies. But because they also slashed the cost of using, acquiring, and processing information, they accelerated the pace and efficiency of collective learning and ensured that collective learning would now take place on global rather than local scales. This wave saw a sharp upturn in industrial production in many regions that had barely been touched by earlier waves, particularly in Latin America, East Asia, and Southwest Asia. It also witnessed an increase in the wealth and influence of multinational corporations. Particularly in the more industrialized regions—the dynamos of the world economy—the postwar boom seemed to slow in the late 1970s and 1980s.

Then growth accelerated once more in a sixth wave of innovation. This wave is still in motion, early in the twenty-first century. Its dominant technologies are electronic and genetic, while its most striking early effect has been to draw all parts of the world more tightly together than ever before. Manuel Castells has argued that the last two decades of the twentieth century mark the transition to an entirely new phase of capitalist history, which he labels the “Information Age.”10 In this phase, he maintains, flows of information are the key to profit making; the boundaries between individual enterprises are being erased, as production and services are organized in constantly shifting alliances or networks of enterprises, many of which subcontract much of their work to individuals or smaller companies. The control and movement of information have become perhaps the largest single sector of industry.11 Global flows of information and wealth have become so rapid, and have such little respect for traditional boundaries, that they have blurred the borders between states as well as between enterprises. In 2000, many international corporations had as much market value as many major states, and most of these massive corporations dealt in communications (see table 14.2).

Taken together, the fifth and sixth waves of innovation sustained a boom in production far larger than that of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1900 and 1950, the total output of the global economy rose from just over $2 trillion to just over $5 trillion. In the next fifty years it rose to ca. $39 trillion. These figures indicate that global production multiplied almost twenty times in the twentieth century. Growth in just the three years from 1995 to 1998 is estimated to have been greater than total growth in the 10,000 years before 1900.12

Creation: Consumer Capitalism and New Lifeways




The positive side of change is apparent in the staggering wealth of the most industrialized regions. Large populations in these regions have enjoyed high and rising levels of material affluence. In the nineteenth century, critics of capitalism saw its capacity to create poverty but underestimated its capacity to create material wealth. Some of those who did appreciate its productive potential (such as Rosa Luxemburg) argued that capitalism’s extraordinary dynamism would prove its downfall. The more it produced, the greater the difficulty of finding buyers. Whereas for most earlier epochs of human history scarcity had been the fundamental problem faced by peoples and governments, now the main issue was to cope with abundance. (Marxists called this the “realization” problem—the problem of realizing profits through sales.) However, from late in the nineteenth century on, capitalist economies began to find a solution by treating their own workers not simply as factory fodder but also as potential markets for the goods they produced in such vast quantities. Just as viruses often evolve so as to protect their prey, so capitalism learned (in a move that Marx seems not to have anticipated) to protect, and even woo, its own proletariat into a new, and less unbalanced, form of symbiosis. This move is what generated the consumer capitalism of the twentieth century. Its distinctive feature has been the requirement that the mass of the population should consume commodities in ever-increasing amounts for the good of the entire system. To ensure the existence of a mass consumer market, wages had to be raised, consumer goods had to be marketed aggressively, and there had to be an end to the old-fashioned ethos of saving and conserving, the economic morality that had dominated most communities for most of human history. These changes began in the nineteenth century, but the shape of modern consumer capitalism first came into focus in the United States in the 1920s. Some of the earliest critiques of consumer capitalism—for example, Sinclair Lewis’s 1922 novel, Babbitt—also appeared in the United States early in the twentieth century.

For governments, of course, disposing of surpluses is a more congenial problem than managing scarcity, the central task for most earlier states. The highly productive social and economic system of modern capitalism could defuse the hostility of subordinate classes by offering them living standards that would have gratified many a monarch in earlier historical epochs. In this way, consumer capitalism transformed traditional political problems, making it possible for modern elites to generate loyalty through gift-giving on a massive scale. It is this change, more than anything else, that explains the survival and resilience of liberal capitalist societies in the world’s most industrialized regions.

Consumer capitalism has transformed the rhythms of historical change. The agrarian world was governed by Malthusian cycles, as population growth periodically outstripped productive capacity. During the “great depression” of the 1870s, it became apparent for the first time that economic growth could falter because of overproduction as well as underproduction. Manufacturers in sectors of rapidly growing productivity found that markets were too small to absorb what they could now produce. Over the following decades, it became clear that in a world of steadily increasing productivity, the problem of finding (or creating) markets would shape the rhythms of economic activity much as the problem of insufficient productivity had done in the agrarian era. As a result, the modern era is dominated by cycles of activity with a different (normally a shorter) periodicity, which we know as business cycles. Coping with those cycles has generated quite new types of behavior on the part of entrepreneurs, governments, and consumers in the most industrialized countries. At first, many governments and entrepreneurs reacted to rising levels of productivity by demanding protection for their own markets and creating protected markets in colonial regions. But this proved a self-defeating strategy, not only generating intolerable military conflict but also partitioning the huge world markets that had fueled much industrial growth in the nineteenth century. In the long run, John Maynard Keynes and others realized that avoiding cyclical downturns means maintaining and sustaining markets rather than monopolizing them. Thus a central concern of twentieth-century consumer capitalism was to create and expand markets. This change helps explain the ethical revolution that has made consumption a virtue as fundamental as abstinence had been in the precapitalist world. And it explains the emergence of a powerful new priesthood of advertisers, most visible on television in their ceaseless advocacy of consuming.

The beneficiaries of these changes enjoyed unparalleled levels of material prosperity and entirely new forms of freedom. In the richer countries, medical advances have improved health and eliminated many once unavoidable causes of physical misery. Indeed, lifestyles have changed so greatly that they may be exerting a significant evolutionary impact on human bodies. Studies in the United States suggest that people of the late twentieth century were not only taller than their predecessors of a century earlier but also had less skeletal toughness. Improved nutrition and medical care, coupled with lazier lifestyles, may be exerting much more evolutionary pressure on our species than we had realized.13

Personal relations have also been transformed. Though levels of interpersonal violence remain high, modern democratic societies frown on such behavior; most people are freer from the threat of violence than they would have been in traditional tributary societies, in which physical coercion was a more acceptable form of control. The political structures of democratic states, despite their many failings, also offer an unprecedented degree of legal protection to individuals. And the control over information that sustained the privileges of elites in the past has been lessened by the progress of mass education. Particularly striking is the slow breakdown of traditional gender roles that restricted the opportunities available to women. The spread of contraception and new forms of employment that depend less on physical strength have made it easier for women to take on many of the more specialized roles outside the household that men had monopolized in traditional societies. As a result, though women’s wages and rates of promotion still lag well behind those of men in most sectors of most industrialized economies, the long-term trends in the more developed countries have seen a significant increase in their educational levels and employment opportunities. In 1990, in industrialized countries there were as many women as men in institutions of secondary and tertiary education, and there were almost 80 women in paid employment for every 100 men. By comparison, in the world as a whole there were only about 80 women in secondary education and 65 in tertiary education for every 100 men, and there were only about 60 women in paid employment for every 100 men.14

The immense gains enjoyed in the twentieth century by those living in the richer countries illustrate the astonishing creativity of the Modern Revolution. And that creativity holds out the tantalizing promise of a better future for human beings everywhere.





The Contradictions of Capitalism: Inequality and Poverty




Yet despite the remarkable positive changes seen in the twentieth century, in many ways and for many people the impact of the Modern Revolution was much less benign. In principle, the increased productivity of modern societies held out the possibility of building, for the first time, societies in which all sectors of society were free from the oppression of material poverty. This was the grand vision of socialism. But it was also clear to most socialists that although capitalism created the material preconditions for such a society, its basic structures were fundamentally inegalitarian. The productive dynamism that seemed to be capitalism’s greatest virtue was driven by an unequal distribution of control over productive resources. Capitalism, it seemed, needed steep gradients in the distribution of wealth in order to survive and flourish. Marx argued that the system could not work without an appropriate mixture of owners and non-owners of productive resources. His conclusion seemed to mean that as long as capitalism existed, inequality would increase. For socialists, it followed that to build a society in which the benefits of high productivity would be available to all sections of the population, capitalism itself would have to be overthrown. But would a socialist society be able to match capitalism’s high levels of productivity? Would more egalitarian societies be capable of matching the high productivity of capitalism, productivity on which socialist hopes for a world free of material poverty ultimately rested? The twentieth century was to suggest some answers to these agonizing questions.

Developments in the twentieth century vindicated much in the socialist critique of capitalism. The same forces that generated the extraordinary material abundance of the twentieth century also magnified global inequalities both within and between nations. Wealth was increasingly piled up in huge reservoirs that made the immense valleys of poverty between them seem all the more squalid. Capitalism has proved its capacity to generate abundant material wealth; but so far it has proved incapable of distributing global wealth in equitable, humane, and sustainable ways.

Though our attempts to measure these inequities are crude and approximate, they suggest some clear trends. Estimates of global income per head suggest that this gauge rose from $1,500 in 1900 to $6,600 in 1998. During the same period, global life expectancy, one of the most critical of all indicators of well-being, has risen from ca. 35 years to ca. 66 years.15 These are significant gains, but they have been distributed unevenly, as tables 14.3 and 14.4 show. While the per capita gross national income of the United States was ca. $34,100 in 2000 (and that of the highest income countries averaged ca. $27,680), the per capita gross national income of Brazil was ca. $3,580, that of China (an economic superpower just two centuries ago) was ca. $840, and those of India (another former economic giant) and Burkina Faso stood respectively at $450 and $210. The ratios make these disparities even more striking (see table 14.3). These figures indicate that the per capita gross national income of Burkina Faso was less than 1 percent of the average for highest income countries, while the figures for India and the whole of sub-Saharan Africa were just over 1.5 percent of that average. The ratios for life expectancy statistics are not as extreme, of course, and modern medical knowledge has raised life expectancies throughout the world. Nevertheless, the statistics tell a clear story of lives shortened by relative poverty (see table 14.4).

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the wealth gap seems to have widened. In 1960, the wealthiest 20 percent of the world’s population earned ca. 30 times as much income as the poorest 20 percent; in 1991 that multiple had soared to 61.16 Conditions have especially deteriorated in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In the early 1970s, Africa was self-sufficient in food production, and even exported surpluses. It is therefore shocking to realize that in the 1990s, if South Africa is excluded, the total gross domestic product of sub-Saharan Africa’s population of 450 million was less than that of Belgium, with a population of only 11 million.17

These statistics are a reminder that for millions of people, modernity has led to worse living conditions. The number of adults suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been kept below 1 percent in wealthier countries because they have the medical and educational resources to take the necessary preventive measures. In contrast, in Zimbabwe 26 percent of all adults were HIV-positive in the mid-1990s, and levels were almost as high in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia.18 Food shortages provide another shocking measure of inequality. Famine is only their most extreme form; more often, shortages mean lives ground down by the misery of chronic malnutrition. As Paul Harrison writes: “The everyday reality of malnutrition in the Third World is … adults scraping through, physically and mentally fatigued and vulnerable to illness. It is children—often dying, not so frequently of hunger alone, as of hunger working hand in hand with sickness; but more often surviving impaired for life.”19 In the late 1990s, more than 800 million people (ca. 14 percent of the world’s population) were estimated to be undernourished, while 1.2 billion (ca. 20 percent) did not have access to clean and safe water.20 Table 14.5 gives some summary demographic and economic statistics for 1994.





The Destruction of Traditional Lifeways




Figures such as those in the tables above reflect more than a falling behind in relation to the richer countries. They also tell us of the destruction of traditional lifeways—and of the safety nets built into them in local traditions of charity or specialized institutions such as emergency granaries. The decline in production of those countries that did not industrialize before the middle of the twentieth century is apparent from the figures in table 13.2, and declining production unraveled all the traditional safety nets. The fate of eighteenth-century English peasants facing enclosure is repeated today as population pressure or debt or taxation or war undermines established rural lifeways. Statistics on urbanization offer an indirect index of this change. In 1800, 97 percent of the world’s population lived in settlements of fewer than 20,000 people. By the middle of the twentieth century, the number had fallen to ca. 75 percent, and by 1980 to ca. 60 percent. In 2000, for the first time in human history, as many people lived in settlements containing more than 20,000 people as in smaller communities.21 In 1800, Britain and Belgium were the only countries in the world in which less than 20 percent of the population found employment in agriculture or fisheries. Today, peasant farming remains the dominant lifeway in only three major regions—sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and China—and in many of their communities, peasants are barely surviving. Eric Hobsbawm has argued that “the most dramatic and far-reaching social change of the second half of this century, and the one which cuts us off for ever from the world of the past, is the death of the peasantry.”22

The statistics are a bloodless way of describing such changes; the following description conveys a sense of what they could mean to families and individuals. It comes from Paul Harrison’s account of an interview he conducted in the 1980s with the head of a household in Burkina Faso, the African nation that lies north of Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Ghana, and Togo. As in much of the Sahel, farming in Burkina Faso was based on shifting cultivation. Inhabitants prepared land that had not been farmed for a few decades by chopping down vegetation and setting it alight. Crops were then planted in the ashy soil: millet and sorghum for food, cotton or groundnuts for sale. Fertility was usually high for a year or two, then rapidly declined, so that communities had to move on and prepare a new patch of ground. Such methods can support only thin populations, for obvious reasons: at any given time, most of the land is fallow. But in recent years, population pressure had forced farmers to speed up the cycle and return to each patch before its fertility had been restored. Eventually, overuse threatened to destroy the soil itself, irrevocably.

Paul Harrison met and interviewed a 60-year-old farmer named Moumouni, who had lived through several stages in the developing crisis that has ruined much of the traditional croplands across the southern borders of the Sahara.



Moumouni remembered that, when he was a child, only twelve people lived in his father’s compound. Now there were thirty-four, with five young men working away from home on the Ivory Coast. Land in the village is allocated by the chief on the basis: to each according to his need… . Yet the village’s traditional lands had not expanded at all… . The additional land needed had been taken out of the five sixths that usually lay fallow. Fallow periods had been slowly whittled down over the decades, until they were now only four or five years, when at least twelve would have been needed to restore the exhausted fertility of the soil.





Moumouni showed Harrison his land.



Even close in to the compound, the soil looked poor enough, stony and dusty, without a trace of humus. And this was the only area they ever fertilized, with the droppings of a donkey and a couple of goats. Outside a circle of about fifty yards’ diameter round the houses, the ground was a dark red, baked hard. It had been cultivated the year before but had yielded very little. Moumouni said he didn’t think anything would grow there this year.23





The impact of such difficulties can be calculated on a national basis. A World Bank report estimates the cost of “crop, livestock, and fuelwood losses from land degradation” in Burkina Faso in 1988 as ca. 8.8 percent of the country’s gross national product.24

The lives of traditional foragers have been subjected to an equally violent assault in the twentieth century. But the change they have undergone is curiously incomplete, despite the colossal mismatch in scale and resources between foraging communities and modern capitalist states. Indeed, it may be the mismatch that explains the remarkable capacity of many such communities to preserve something of their past. Where their lands were needed for settlement or mining, they were removed with brutality and little ceremony; otherwise, they were often left in peace. Their military encounters with modern societies often took the form of guerrilla wars or small-scale military confrontations. The conflicts were real enough, and sometimes states became directly involved, as they did in the Indian wars in the United States, or the many guerrilla campaigns fought with kin-ordered communities from Australia to Siberia. But when the fighting was over, kin-ordered communities could often find niches within the societies that had taken so much from them. So, in a sense, they survived, and continue to the present day, preserving far more of their past than was possible for the peasant communities of the agrarian world. And the modern world has much to learn from communities whose lifeways have lasted so much longer than those of industrial capitalism.





The Destruction of Traditional Tributary Empires




Modern capitalism has also destroyed the larger political structures of the era of agrarian civilizations. The great tributary empires that dominated the era of agrarian civilizations vanished with remarkable swiftness. In 1793, when George Macartney was sent as ambassador by George III to ask for equal diplomatic representation and trading rights in China, his request was refused by the Qing emperor, Qianlong, who referred to England as a “remote and inaccessible region, far across the spaces of ocean.” However, the emperor congratulated George III for his “submissive loyalty” in sending “this tribute mission” and encouraged him to show obedience in the future “so that you may enjoy the blessings of perpetual peace.”25 These were the arrogant attitudes that Europeans themselves would display toward the rest of the world a century later. At the time, they seemed perfectly realistic; after all, Europe produced little that China could not produce better and more cheaply, so Europeans had to buy most Chinese goods in exchange for silver.

Soon, however, British traders found something else that Chinese consumers wanted: Indian-produced opium, a substance whose consumption had been banned in China. At first trading illegally, in the 1840s British traders, backed by gunboats, forced the Chinese government to allow this new, if destructive, trade during the so-called Opium Wars. In 1839, the local Chinese official at Guangzhou compelled British ships to surrender their opium, and proceeded to destroy it. To Queen Victoria a Chinese official, Lin Zexu, wrote: “We have heard that in your honourable country, the people are not permitted to inhale the drug. If it is so regarded as deleterious, how can seeking profit by exposing others to its malefic powers be reconciled with the decrees of Heaven?”26 Claiming that the real issue was free trade rather than opium, the prime minister of England, Lord Palmerston, sent a fleet to blockade Guangzhou, and it clashed with Chinese naval vessels. During the next two years, British ships began to attack other ports. Eventually they took control of the Yangtze cities from which Beijing itself was supplied along the Grand Canal, forcing the Chinese to back down in 1842. Chinese military and naval technology, which had changed little since the time of Marco Polo, was no match for British equipment. The gulf in technologies and productivity levels that industrialization had opened up caused the collapse of the Chinese empire in the early twentieth century. By the end of the century, there existed no political or economic structures that fit Eric Wolf’s model of “tributary states,” even though such states had dominated the world a mere two centuries before.

While the speed with which the ancient tributary empires collapsed was one striking feature of the past two centuries, another has escaped general notice: many characteristics of the traditional tributary world survived in the great Communist empires of the twentieth century.27 Communist governments appeared in Russia and then in China, led by modernizing revolutionary movements. But their ideologies were as much anticapitalist as antiautocratic. This feature helps explain their appeal to societies whose elites felt acutely the insult of capitalism’s assault on their traditional prestige and culture. Stalin’s radical rejection of capitalism during the collectivization drive of the early 1930s meant that the Soviet Union had to compete with the major industrial powers without enjoying the innovatory dynamism of capitalism. Central control of economic and intellectual exchanges stifled the commercial and intellectual transactions that are the lifeblood of capitalism, and censorship clogged the networks of collective learning that generated so many petty innovations in market economies. Maoist China followed a similar course after 1949. Where market forces were banned, there was little choice but to mobilize resources in more traditional ways, using techniques of taxation and social and economic organization similar to those of the great tributary empires—but with the addition of some twentieth-century technologies, from telephones to tanks. Like traditional tributary empires, the command economies of the Communist world were better at mobilizing resources than at raising productivity. Recent estimates suggest that improvements in efficiency levels can explain no more than 24 percent and perhaps as little as 2 percent of the increases in output in the Soviet Union during the first three Stalinist five-year plans. Most of the achievements of the Soviet industrialization drive rested on a massive, and highly coercive, mobilization of capital, raw materials, and labor.28 Neither the labor of the Soviet population nor its resources were spared in the government’s determination to match the industrial and military might of its capitalist rivals.

For a while—particularly in the 1930s, when the capitalist world itself was in crisis, and again in the 1950s—it seemed as if these new, state-managed structures might generate a dynamism to match that of capitalism. What they lacked in entrepreneurial flair they made up for in systematic commitment to high levels of education, in the introduction of modern technologies, and in the massive organizational capacity of powerful and ruthless states using modern technologies of communication. But in time their innovatory sluggishness, the same quality that had slowed innovation throughout the era of agrarian civilizations, ensured that they would fall behind their capitalist rivals in productivity levels, in innovation, and eventually in military capability. The wasteful habits of the construction phase proved hard to shake, and the Soviet command economy never managed to shift from resource-intensive to resource-economizing forms of growth; eventually, it ran out of resources. The collapse of the Soviet Union was, as Mikhail Gorbachev understood, a failure to compete economically and technologically. Mobilizational capacity could not, in the long run, compensate for sluggish innovation:



At some stage—this became particularly clear in the latter half of the seventies—something happened that was at first sight inexplicable. The country began to lose momentum… . A kind of “braking mechanism” affecting social and economic development formed. And all this happened at a time when scientific and technological revolution opened up new prospects for economic and social progress. Something strange was taking place: the huge fly-wheel of a powerful machine was revolving, while either transmission from it to work places was skidding or drive belts were too loose.



Analyzing the situation, we first discovered a slowing economic growth. In the last fifteen years the national income growth rates had declined by more than a half and by the beginning of the eighties had fallen to a level close to economic stagnation. A country that was once quickly closing on the world’s advanced nations began to lose one position after another. Moreover, the gap in the efficiency of production, quality of products, scientific and technological development, the production of advanced technology, and the use of advanced techniques began to widen, and not to our advantage.29





Gorbachev’s attempts to introduce a new dynamism by relaxing the grip of the planners on the economy and society ended with the collapse of the entire system. In the 1990s, Russia had to start rebuilding capitalism, almost from scratch.

China has faced similar challenges, but it has taken a different route. Under its surface, Communist China is becoming a capitalist society, using methods that were not open to the Soviet leadership because the structures and habits of capitalism were not eliminated as decisively in China as they had been in the Soviet Union. The experiences of the Communist era suggest that scrapping capitalism will not necessarily provide a solution to the many problems that capitalism creates. The Communist societies of the twentieth century could not match the productivity of their capitalist rivals; but neither were they strikingly egalitarian.





Conflict




Not surprisingly, a world of such instability, in which gradients of inequality are steadily rising, has been ridden with conflict. The past hundred years saw more violent conflict than any previous century in human history. The scale of the human and material damage caused by war reflects the increased “productivity” of armies and weapons in the modern era, as well as the increased size of the armies and the populations at war. William Eckhardt has roughly calculated that 3.7 million people died in war in the 1,500 years up to 1500 CE. In the sixteenth century, he estimates that 1.6 million died in war; in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 6.1 million and 7.0 million; and in the nineteenth century, 19.4 million. In the twentieth century, war deaths reached 109.7 million, or almost three times the sum of all deaths in the preceding 1,900 years (see table 14.6).30 Deaths in the Second World War alone reached 53.5 million. Equally spectacular were the casualties that might have been suffered but were not, through the (fortunate?) avoidance of nuclear war. But nuclear wars were prepared for. In 1986, there were almost 70,000 nuclear warheads, with a total explosive power equivalent to 18 billion tons of TNT—3.6 tons for every individual on earth.31 If they had been used, these weapons would have caused a catastrophe similar in its scale and many of its consequences to the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous era, which destroyed most species of large dinosaurs.

Smaller wars have taken as great a toll as the world wars and the cold war. Between 1900 and the mid-1980s there were some 275 different wars.32 Between 1945 and 2000, there were nine regional wars in which more than 1 million people died; and in these wars, civilian casualties exceeded military casualties. The Korean and Vietnam Wars caused the deaths, respectively, of 10 percent and 13 percent of national populations.33 Since the end of the cold war, changes have occurred that may prove very significant in the long run. In the 1990s, global military expenditures declined by perhaps 40 percent, and stocks of weapons of all kinds fell. (The “war on terrorism” initiated after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, may reverse this trend.) Warfare has become more localized and has increasingly taken place within states, or between states and guerrilla armies of various kinds, a shift that implies a reduction in scale (though no reduction in the horror for those involved).34 These figures mark a shift in the nature of warfare rather than a real reduction in the amount of violent conflict. The tensions and dislocations of the hurricane of change affecting the entire globe will ensure that conflict remains endemic, and modern weaponry will ensure that local conflicts continue to cause great suffering.





CHANGES IN HUMAN RELATIONS WITH THE BIOSPHERE




The scale of human society and the extent of its productive (and destructive) capacity in the twentieth century have ensured that the Modern Revolution has had an impact on the world environment that is no longer just regional but is also global. This is why most significant indicators of the environmental impact of human populations “mimic the same exponential curve over the past three centuries.”35

One rough measure of human environmental impacts arises out of attempts to measure the changing energy requirements of human societies (see table 6.1). These figures make clear that total human energy consumption multiplied many more times in the twentieth century than in all of previous human history. At the end of the twentieth century, the total amount of energy consumed by humans may have been 60,000 to 90,000 times that used by humans early in the Neolithic era. As a result of these changes, human societies became, in the twentieth century, a major force acting on the entire biosphere. As we have seen already, estimates of the distribution of global “net primary productivity” on the land suggest that up to 25 percent, and perhaps as much as 40 percent, is being co-opted by our own species (see p. 140).

Given that the resources of the biosphere are finite, human use of energy, resources, and space on this scale has inevitably reduced the resources available for other species. Declining biodiversity is one unavoidable consequence. Teamed up with domesticates and fellow travelers such as rabbits, goats, and weeds, humans have reduced biodiversity by destroying or appropriating the habitats of other species. In 1996, about 20 percent of all vertebrate species were in significant danger of extinction.36 As Richard Leakey has argued, the scale of modern extinctions could prove similar in magnitude to the five other great extinction events known to paleontologists in which at least 65 percent of all marine species vanished.37

Will there even be enough resources to support our own species at an acceptable level? How easy will it be to feed 10 to 12 billion people in a century’s time? It is possible that new technologies, perhaps depending on genetic engineering, will ensure that food production continues to rise at the rapid rates typical of the twentieth century. In the meantime, there is good reason to think we may be approaching some critical limits. We feed ourselves from croplands, grazing lands, and fisheries. The area of grazing lands can hardly be increased much more, and much of the land available is severely degraded. There is also general agreement that the harvest of fish cannot be increased significantly. Meanwhile, the output of croplands depends heavily on increased use of irrigation; since 1950, irrigated land has risen from 94 to 260 million hectares, and now accounts for 40 percent of all food production.38 Yet in many areas, the introduction of modern diesel-powered water pumps has led to a fall in water tables, an outcome suggesting that here, too, there is little room for expansion. Ecologically speaking, what is happening is that underground stores of fresh water that were built up over millions of years are being emptied in just a few decades.

Overuse of resources measures one side of the human impact on the biosphere; disposal of wastes is the other. Perhaps the most powerful illustration of the significance of human-generated pollutants is the possibility that we may be fundamentally changing the earth’s atmosphere. Lester Brown argues that “while the Agricultural Revolution transformed the earth’s surface, the Industrial Revolution is transforming the earth’s atmosphere.”39 The temperature at the surface of the earth depends on a precarious balance between the amount of sunlight captured within the earth’s atmosphere and the amount released or reflected back into space. Mars, without a significant atmosphere, retains little of the Sun’s energy, so it is too cold for life. Venus, with a greenhouse atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, is ca. 450°C, too hot for life. The crucial factor (though not the only one) in determining how much of the Sun’s energy is retained at the surface of our planet is the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. During the last ice age, average temperatures were ca. 9° lower than today, and levels of atmospheric CO2 were ca. 190–200 parts per million. By about 1800 CE, CO2 levels had risen to ca. 280 parts per million. At that point, the Industrial Revolution began the massive exploitation of nonorganic fuels such as coal and oil, which greatly increased the amount of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere. Now CO2 levels have reached ca. 350 parts per million, or twice the levels during the ice ages. By 2150 they could nearly double again, to between 550 and 600, if present rates of emission continue. Carbon that was stored in trees and then buried in the ground during many tens of millions of years in the Carboniferous era has been flung back into the atmosphere in just a few decades. A part of the carbon cycle that normally runs on a timescale of many millions of years has been accelerated by several orders of magnitude. Natural processes simply cannot absorb carbon at these rates.

What this explosive release of carbon dioxide will mean in practice is not clear. There is general agreement that it will lead to warming, and global temperatures are already warmer than at the beginning of the twentieth century. Warming may increase ecological productivity in some areas, but it will certainly have a worldwide impact, whether benign or harmful. Average temperatures seem to have been rising for at least two decades, causing unusual periods of heat and dryness, as well as unusual weather patterns. A temperature rise of 2.5°C (a modest estimate) by 2050 would be the equivalent of the changes at the end of the last ice age. Sea levels will go up as the volume of water expands, and ice caps will melt. This will have tragic effects on low-lying areas: the island nations of the Pacific, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and elsewhere. Warming will also affect existing species, including some that are vital for humans. Rice does not tolerate high temperatures, so its productivity may decline as climates warm.40

Perhaps the most worrying aspect of global warming is its unpredictability. Climatologists know that climatic systems, like many other chaotic systems, are subject to sudden, sharp changes. They may change slowly and predictably for a time, then become unstable before switching, quite abruptly, to a new state. The end of the last ice age may have marked one such sudden shift. If the scale of warming today is on a similar scale, we cannot rule out a sudden qualitative shift in global climates—possibly occurring on the scale of a human lifetime.

Declining biodiversity and increased carbon emissions are among the two most significant indicators of human impacts. Lester Brown, former project director of the annual survey State of the World, writes that at the end of the twentieth century, the most dangerous effects of human activity were apparent in six different areas: fresh water, rangelands, oceanic fisheries, forests, biological diversity, and global atmosphere.41 While the impact on the last three is for most people indirect, and therefore easier to ignore, the first three areas are affected more obviously, and in ways that appear to set clear limits to our capacity to feed growing populations. Lack of access to fresh water threatens the health of millions and hinders the potential growth of irrigation agriculture. Moreover, the exploitation of fisheries and rangelands appears to have reached its maximum level.42

In a massive survey of the human impact on the environment published at the beginning of the 1990s, Robert W. Kates, B. L. Turner II, and William C. Clark make an interesting attempt to measure the extent of human environmental impacts on several different scales. They take ten fundamental measures of human effects on the environment, estimate the total impact between 10,000 years ago and 1985, then attempt to identify the dates when each type of change attained 25 percent, then 50 percent, and finally 75 percent of its 1985 level; their figures are presented in table 14.7. The quickest way of appreciating the significance of this table is to look at the dates at which each type of impact reached 50 percent of its 1985 level. For seven of these variables, more change occurred in the 40 years from 1945 to 1985 than had occurred in the previous 10,000 years.43 As for the remaining three variables—deforestation, rates of extinction of vertebrate species, and carbon release into the atmosphere—50 percent of all change has occurred since the middle of the nineteenth century. Table 6.1 tells a similar story for human use of energy. Chronologically speaking, the twentieth century is a tiny chunk of history, but the scale of the transformations it has witnessed dwarfs all of previous human history.

TABLE 14.7. HUMAN-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, 10,000 BCE TO THE MID-1980S CE





In the course of the twentieth century, human beings caused changes so decisive, so rapid, and so vast in their scale that they force us to see human history, once again, as an integral part of the history of the biosphere. The statistics collected in this chapter give some impression of the scale and speed of change. What they cannot do is give us any clear indications of its long-term implications, creating instead the impression of something very large moving at very high speed. And that, perhaps, is the most worrying aspect of this brief survey of twentieth-century history—the fear that it is like a traffic accident in slow motion. Can change continue to accelerate without dangerous consequences for human society and the biosphere as a whole? Or will the astonishing creativity that is the other side of the Modern Revolution lead us toward a more stable and more sustainable relationship with our natural environment? The next chapter, which considers possible futures at several different scales, will begin by considering these questions.





SUMMARY




The changes that occurred in the twentieth century are, by many measures, greater than the changes that took place in all previous eras of human history. As the Modern Revolution hit its stride, productive capacity soared; so, too, did living standards in the industrialized hub regions, as governments and business began to see the material satisfaction of their own populations as the key to a flourishing capitalist society. But outside the hub regions, much of the impact of the Modern Revolution was destructive. Here, traditional lifeways, and the safeguards built into them, were largely destroyed, as were the states that presided over them. The Communist states of the mid-twentieth century sought to match the economic and military successes of capitalist societies, while avoiding the inequalities inseparable from capitalism. But they succeeded neither in keeping up with their rivals nor in creating societies that offered attractive alternatives. As spectacular as the economic and technological changes of the twentieth century was the increasing human impact on the biosphere, which escalated more rapidly than in any other era. Early in the twenty-first century, human societies were beginning to have a major effect on the entire biosphere, and evidence grew stronger that humans were beginning to live beyond sustainable limits. The acceleration in the pace and scale of change is perhaps the most striking and (for contemporaries) the most frightening aspect of twentieth-century history. The scale of human impacts on the biosphere and on other humans is now so great that the changes of the twentieth century will stand out on the scale of planetary history.
