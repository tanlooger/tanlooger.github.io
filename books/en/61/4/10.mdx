title: CHAPTER 10 LONG TRENDS IN THE ERA OF AGRARIAN “CIVILIZATIONS”
---






The era of agrarian civilizations has dominated conventional accounts of human history, partly because agrarian civilizations were the first human communities to generate the written records on which most modern historical research has been based. So we know this era in great detail. However, on the scale of big history, recounting a detailed description of this era is not appropriate. Besides, many fine histories already exist. Instead, this chapter will examine some of the large structures and trends that shaped the era of agrarian civilizations. Traditional approaches, which focus on particular civilizations or cultures, can easily hide these large trends. As Robert Wright has put it, ancient world history can often seem a blur of civilizations and peoples, rising and falling. But “if we relax our vision, and let these details go fuzzy, then a larger picture comes into focus: As the centuries fly by, civilizations may come and go, but civilization flourishes, growing in scope and complexity.”1

This chapter, which surveys the 4,000 and more years during which agrarian civilizations were the most powerful communities on earth, will concentrate first on the large-scale structures. Second, it will discuss some of the more important long-term trends of this era, focusing particularly on changes in the collective human capacity to manipulate the natural environment. These show up in population growth and in more productive technologies. Central questions posed in the chapter will be, what processes shaped long-term patterns of collective learning and innovation in the era of agrarian civilizations? and how did these processes play out in different parts of the world?





LARGE STRUCTURES




Two structural features stand out in this era. First, with the appearance of cities and states, human societies became more diverse than ever before. And diversity itself was a powerful motor of collective learning, for it increased the ecological, technological, and organizational possibilities available to different communities, as well as the potential synergies of combining these technologies in new ways. But states also increased the scale of human interactions. Because they were so much larger than all earlier human communities, their powerful gravitational fields sucked in resources, people, and ideas from great distances. By doing so, agrarian civilizations created vast new networks of exchange. These count as the era’s second main structural feature. Networks of exchange that were more extensive, more varied, and more dynamic than those of any earlier era increased both the scale and variety of exchanges and the potential synergies of collective learning.





New Forms of Diversity




At the risk of seeming overly schematic, we can think of four main types of societies in this era: three—foragers, independent farmers, and pastoralists—lack states; one—agrarian civilizations—has states.

Foragers survived throughout the era of agrarian civilizations, living in small, usually nomadic communities and mostly depending on technologies without metals. Despite some intensification, Australia was occupied exclusively by foragers until just over two hundred years ago. Similar communities also lived, until several centuries ago, in most of North and South America, in Siberia, in many parts of southern and Southeast Asia, and in parts of Africa.

In many regions, large populations of farmers or horticulturalists lived much as they had in the early agrarian era, without large-scale power structures. Such communities made up most of the population of Papua New Guinea until recent decades; often, they had contacts of trade and sometimes of war with neighboring farmers or foragers, and sometimes with traders from Indonesia. Communities of stateless farmers could be found in much of Africa, and in areas of North and South America. They could also be found along the borders of great tributary empires, from Manchuria to northern Germany.

Where productivity increased and populations grew, farming communities and technologies spread into regions that had been only thinly populated before, thereby laying the foundations for new regions of agrarian civilization. In eastern Europe, for example, from the middle of the first millennium CE, large numbers of farmers, many of them speaking ancient Slavic languages, settled in what is now Russia, where they laid the demographic foundations for the first Russian states. Such changes have often been interpreted too simply as the result of migrations of whole peoples who brought with them more productive technologies. For example, the spread of Indo-European languages from somewhere north of the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, Iran, central Asia, and North India has been linked to the spread of agriculture or pastoralism. Similarly, the spread of Bantu languages from the Cameroon region to much of central and southern Africa has often been explained as a result of migrations of peoples who displaced indigenous communities already existing there because they used more productive agricultural technologies and practiced iron metallurgy. Modern interpretations of the spread of whole language groups are more complex, seeing them as the product of many different processes, including the diffusion of languages to local populations through trade or through political or cultural domination, as well as demographic expansion, technological change, and migration. Nevertheless, the expansion of entire language groups clearly does suggest the slow spread of more productive technologies of various kinds, from improved crops, such as rye in eastern Europe, to improved implements, including iron hoes and plows.2

One of the most astonishing of these expansionary movements, the creation of an entirely new “world zone” in the Pacific Ocean, clearly does reflect migrations of peoples. But “Remote Oceania,” including the outer islands of Micronesia and Polynesia, was not settled until the appearance of specialized seafaring cultures with advanced boatbuilding and navigational technologies, perhaps 3,500 years ago. These peoples probably came from South China or Taiwan, which appear to be the homelands of the Austronesian languages that all these groups shared. In the Pacific, we can trace their migrations through the spread of a distinctive type of pottery, known as Lapita ware. The furthest limits of these migrations were Easter Island (Rapa Nui), first settled about 300 CE; Hawai’i and (far to the west) Madagascar, both first settled ca. 500 CE; and New Zealand (Aotearoa), first settled ca. 800 CE or possibly as late as 1000-1200 CE.3 Jared Diamond has shown how the evolution of these Pacific island societies demonstrates the impact of ecological factors on social development: within one or two thousand years, there had appeared in the Pacific a vast array of different types of societies, ranging from technologically simple foraging societies to powerful proto-states with strict class systems and populations of 30,000 to 40,000 in Hawai’i and Tonga.4

The third type of community was confined to Afro-Eurasia, as it depended primarily on the exploitation of domesticated livestock. In many of the more arid regions of Afro-Eurasia, and in parts of northern Siberia, there lived nomadic or seminomadic pastoralists who herded cattle, sheep, horses, or reindeer. Like most independent farmers, pastoralists normally had contacts with neighboring agrarian civilizations through warfare, commerce, and the exchange of religious and technical ideas. Particularly in Eurasia, horse-riding pastoralists could pose a serious military threat to their neighbors, because of their mobility and the virtuosity with which they used horses and camels in warfare. From late in the first millennium BCE, some pastoralist communities created powerful empires in the Eurasian steppes by exacting resources from their richer sedentary neighbors. The greatest and most influential of these empires was founded by Genghis Khan in the thirteenth century CE: it was the first political empire to reach from the Pacific to the Mediterranean.

Communities without states played an immensely important role in the era of agrarian civilizations, though they generated few written records and have consequently been neglected by historians. Because they lived in the lands between the great agrarian civilizations, they could often link their powerful neighbors into larger networks of exchange, particularly in Afro-Eurasia. While the Silk Roads provide the clearest illustration of this mechanism,5 stateless communities also linked the emerging civilizations of Mesoamerica and Peru. Agrarian civilizations tended to be localized, but the stateless communities that lay beyond their control had more diffuse borders; the contacts between these different types of societies created the largest exchange networks of all in the premodern world.

Communities with states were the real dynamos of change in this period, however. The distinctive features of agrarian civilizations were their size, the density of human settlement within them, and their social complexity. No previous communities had approached them in scale or complexity. Only the largest communities of the early agrarian era contained more than 500 people, and most had fewer than 50. In contrast, even one of the earliest cities, Uruk, contained at its height perhaps 50,000 people. And this huge mass of people depended on nearby rural communities for much of their food and labor, had close links with about thirteen other city-states in southern Mesopotamia, and traded through the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, even as far as northern India and central Asia. The total population of the region of interrelated city-states in southern Mesopotamia probably reached several hundred thousand people. This combination of dense populations and hierarchical networks of exchange that embraced hundreds of thousands or millions of people living in very different types of communities, and that extended well beyond the frontiers of particular polities, is one of the most important structural features of the era of agrarian civilizations.

Agrarian civilizations always contain several (at least three) tiers of management and exploitation. At their base were primary producers, mostly small farmers or horticulturalists living in villages. These lived in communities similar to those of the early agrarian era, except that now they had standing over them a hierarchy of rulers and tribute takers. Village communities produced foodstuffs, fibers, and fuels such as wood. They also supplied human and animal labor for large-scale endeavors such as irrigation projects, major building projects, and the waging of war. But the village world was still shaped mainly by the needs of the farming household, so here, more than elsewhere, men and women were partners. Above this sphere, as specialized roles became more important, men began to assume separate, usually dominant, roles, and patriarchy became more institutionalized.

Above the villages stood local elites and power brokers—chiefs, nobles, officials, or priests. Local power brokers extracted resources from primary producers, but they usually preferred not to interfere directly in the life of those below them. As a result, agrarian civilizations were normally characterized by a clear gap in status, wealth, lifeways, and habits of thought between the mass of primary producers and the tribute takers who stood above them.6 Above local power brokers there was always at least one more level of cities and rulers, who supported themselves from the resources passed on by regional power brokers. Sometimes, there appeared even higher levels of rulers who ruled over rulers—“Shahs of Shahs,” to use the Persian royal title.

So, even in the simplest of agrarian civilizations, many different types of community were caught up in the networks of political, economic, and ideological power through which elites mobilized the resources they needed. The way in which resources were mobilized shaped the lives of both elites and primary producers. And these methods reached even into the households that were society’s productive foundation. Here, despite the rough equality within the peasant household, males often claimed (with varying degrees of success) a reflected authority modeled on the prominent role of males beyond the basic units of the household and village. Religious, cultural, and legal structures often supported these patriarchal claims.

The most important way of shifting resources from households to elites was through demands backed up by a combination of religious, legal, and physical threats. For this reason, Eric Wolf has described agrarian civilizations as “tribute-taking” societies.7 Unlike gift-giving, which is the characteristic way of exchanging goods in kin-ordered societies (and analogous to mutualism in the biological world), tribute-taking is, by definition, an unbalanced form of exchange. It is closer to parasitism, a relationship in which one side gains more than the other and can usually impose its will on the other.

But as we have seen, there remains an element of reciprocity or mutualism even in tribute-taking societies. Power based on coercion and power based on consent can and do coexist in all tribute-taking societies. Primary producers often depended on tribute takers for protection and other services. In time of war, villagers hid behind castle or city walls. In peacetime, urban markets offered exotic goods and alternative forms of employment, while urban temples offered grander and more potent ways of reaching the gods. Besides, it was in the interests of tributary elites to make sure their peasants had enough land to feed themselves and produce a surplus. In this general sense, tributary rulers and overlords had to protect the rights of their peasant majorities to land. The result was that in practice (though not always in theory), productive resources were spread much more evenly in agrarian societies than they are in the modern world. Rather than demonstrating pure exploitation, agrarian civilizations embodied a complex, though unbalanced, form of symbiosis—analogous, in some ways, to domestication. William McNeill’s analogy with parasitism, quoted in chapter 9, captures the nuances of this imbalance well, for parasites, if they are to survive, have to protect their hosts, just as humans have to protect their domestic animals and feed their slaves. In a more recent essay, McNeill has described this relationship between cities and villages, which lies at the heart of all agrarian civilizations, as “the civilized compromise.”8

Relations of tribute-taking existed not only within but also between neighboring states, and some of these were extremely significant. Agrarian empires can be thought of as tribute-taking systems in which powerful states exact tributes from less powerful states. But occasionally the relationship was reversed. In the biological realm, after all, parasites can be as large as robins and as tiny as bacteria. Like the terrifying species of cichlids, which swoop down on other fish and cut out pieces of their flesh, small states sometimes organized dangerous military forces that could so harass giant neighbors that the latter were forced to pay tributes or protection rents. The best-analyzed examples of these relationships are between pastoral nomads of the Eurasian states and the great states of China, Persia, and the eastern Mediterranean.9

To summarize, certain structures are present, in varying degrees, in all agrarian civilizations. They include:

• Agrarian communities that provide most resources. These are largely separate from elite groups, but they contain most of the population and produce most of society’s people, food, energy, and raw materials.



• Gender hierarchies that support male claims to domination at most levels of the social hierarchy.



• Cities and towns.



• A complex division of labor within cities and towns, and between cities and their rural hinterlands.



• Hierarchies of officials, judges, and rulers headed by kings.



• Armies, controlled by rulers, that provide protection from other tribute takers and also enable the rulers to exact tributes by coercion from their own subjects or from neighboring regions.



• Literate bureaucracies that keep track of and manage resources.



• Networks of exchange, through which states and cities procure resources that cannot be secured through naked force.



• Systems of religion and ideology, often managed by the state, that legitimate state structures and often give rise to monumental architecture and high levels of artistic achievement.



• Wider hinterlands, which are not directly under their control, whose resources are nevertheless vital for their successful functioning. These hinterlands may lie in other regions of agrarian civilization, or may be settled by independent farmers or pastoralists or foragers.





Networks of Exchange




In the era of agrarian civilizations, exchanges linked different types of communities more effectively and over larger areas than ever before. These complex networks of exchange count as the second major structural novelty of the era of agrarian civilizations.

World historians have become increasingly sensitive to the importance of large systems of interaction, and have often analyzed them using the notion of world-systems. Immanuel Wallerstein, the originator of such theories, argued that particularly in the modern era, it was necessary to analyze not just particular nations or civilizations, but rather the larger networks of power and commerce in which they were entangled, because these networks explained features that could not be explained solely from the internal history of particular regions. Wallerstein called these networks “world-systems,” even though they did not literally embrace the entire world, on the grounds that in many regards they functioned as separate worlds. World-systems are multilayered, multiregional structures that incorporate different types of communities; within them, some regions are more influential than others.

Wallerstein focused on the early modern, capitalist world-system, which was dominated by European states. Indeed, he argued that this was the first time that a true world-system had ever appeared. To understand Europe’s increasing power in the early modern world, he insisted that historians had to understand how Europe was entangled in, and benefited from, networks of exchange and power that embraced large parts of the world. Following Wallerstein’s introduction of this notion, other writers have identified similar systems in earlier periods of world history. Janet Abu-Lughod has claimed that there was a Eurasia-wide world-system as early as the thirteenth century, and Andre Gunder Frank, Barry Gills, and others have argued that regional “world systems” (in a looser sense, without a hyphen) may have existed from as early as the third millennium BCE.10 Christopher Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall have gone even further, arguing that in all the world zones, even in regions without states, there existed networks of exchange with at least some of the features of world systems.11

These large networks mark the outer limits within which human communities can share information, technologies, and adaptations. They thus shape processes of collective learning on the largest scales and determine the pace and the geography of innovation over long periods. One of the most important insights of modified world systems theories is that there are different kinds of networks, working in different ways and at different scales. Michael Mann has argued that even states, which appear so neatly bounded, actually wield several different types of power that work in different ways, rather like different force fields.12 He has identified four distinct “networks” of power and influence: ideological, economic, military, and political. Political power is usually limited by recognized frontiers. Military power, in contrast, can be projected beyond those frontiers in ways that are checked only by existing logistical and military technologies. Thus, Chinese generals of the Han period had a reasonably clear idea of how large an army they could send into the Mongolian steppes, and how long they could keep it in the field without excessive cost. Ideological power is more diffuse, because the cultural borders of a region such as China are hard to define; and economic power is even harder to pin down. So economic and informational networks tended to be larger and more diffuse than those controlled directly by force.

Building on this insight, Chase-Dunn and Hall have suggested that there are several distinct types of networks of exchange, each with its own typical range and characteristics. The main types that they identify are bulk-goods networks, prestige-goods networks, political/military networks, and information networks.13 Portability determines the differing ranges of these networks. Until recently, bulk goods, such as grain, were difficult and expensive to transport, so they normally traveled short distances. Armies could usually travel farther, but with their immense baggage trains, they also moved slowly. However, prestige goods such as silk were more portable and traveled over greater distances, while information traveled even more easily. This is why exchanges of information and prestige goods generated the largest and oldest networks of all. (Indeed, prestige goods can often travel farther than information. Think of ornaments that get exchanged so many times that their original meaning is lost.) And this is why I have focused here on the largest exchange networks of all, the informational networks that embraced entire world zones.

Large networks of exchange have distinctive regional “topologies.” It may help to return to the analogy of a social law of gravity. Under this imaginary law, human communities exert an attractive force on other communities and on the goods, the ideas, and the people within them. As human communities grew, this law began to operate in more powerful ways. Roughly speaking (in a surprisingly close analogy to Newton’s law), the magnitude of the gravitational pull between communities is directly proportional to the size of the communities and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

In the Paleolithic era, exchanges were limited and small-scale, because no groups were large enough to exert a significant gravitational pull on other groups. But as larger communities emerged, some exchanged goods and information more briskly and over greater distances than others, because large communities could attract resources and people over large areas. Exchanges of information, of goods, and of people were most dynamic where there were many large communities. In such regions, more information and goods were pooled than anywhere else, so we can refer to them as centers of gravity. They sucked in people, ideas, and produce from huge hinterlands. But they also exerted a powerful gravitational pull over the less densely settled regions that lay between them. To understand how this influence worked, we need to imagine a modern, Einsteinian form of gravity, in which large bodies deform the space-time surrounding them, tilting and twisting it so as to alter the behavior and motion of smaller objects within their gravitational field. Large cities and states transformed the social topology of the regions between them, and sometimes by doing so they created what we can describe as hub regions. Hub regions were situated between regional centers of gravity. In these “gravitational corridors,” or regions at the intersection of several different gravitational fields, they felt the pull of several different centers. Whether or not they were densely settled, hub regions carried a lot of traffic (see figure 10.1).





Figure 10.1. Models of different types of exchange networks. As far as we know, all exchange networks of the Paleolithic era were “flat” or “nonhierarchical.” That is, there was little difference in density from one region to another, and little variety in the pace or intensity of exchanges. With the development of dense agricultural settlement, networks of exchange became more complex and more hierarchical, and there appeared regions in which exchanges of information were so intensive that the pace of “collective learning” began to accelerate noticeably. As a result, the pace of innovation in the Holocene era was significantly faster than in the Paleolithic era.



A glance at a world map suggests immediately that Mesoamerica and the corridor joining Mesopotamia and Egypt were likely to emerge as hub regions, because they linked large and diverse zones. Some regions, such as nineteenth-century CE Europe or Abbasid Mesopotamia, can perhaps be regarded both as hubs and as centers of gravity. They attracted information and goods because of their position and because they contained dense and rich populations. Other regions, such as late-nineteenth-century CE China, count as centers of gravity but not as hubs; conversely, regions such as fifth-century BCE Athens, central Asia 4,000 years ago, or Mongolia in the thirteenth century CE, count as hubs, though they were not populous enough to act as centers of gravity. Both centers of gravity and hub regions powerfully shaped change, because the volume of exchanges passing through them made them clearinghouses for information accumulated over large areas. Nevertheless, the differences between these two types of centers mattered. Centers of gravity gave structure and shape to large networks of exchange, while hub regions were more lightweight and were more easily transformed by the exchanges that swept through them. So it was often in hub regions that significant innovations first became important because here was where they could have the greatest impact, while the mass and momentum of centers of gravity ensured that those regions normally changed more slowly.

The increasing scale, diversity, and complexity of exchange networks energized processes of collective learning over huge areas, and they help account for the peculiar technological, political, and cultural dynamism of the era of agrarian civilizations.





LONG-TERM TRENDS





The Increasing Range and Power of Agrarian Civilizations




In 3000 BCE, the agrarian civilizations that had appeared in southern Mesopotamia and along the Nile were unique; despite their large populations, they included only a tiny proportion of the humans alive at the time. Most people still lived in communities without states. Four thousand years later, in 1000 CE, agrarian civilizations still controlled less than one-fifth of the earth’s surface, but in most other respects they were the dominant communities on earth. They could be found in many parts of Afro-Eurasia, and in parts of the Americas. Small proto-states even existed in the Pacific (see table 10.1).

Why and how did agrarian civilizations become so dominant? Agrarian civilizations could not appear where the dense agrarian populations necessary to sustain them did not already exist. So the spread of agrarian civilizations was intimately connected with the spread of agriculture, and that, as we have seen, depended on technological innovations that enabled agriculturalists to farm an increasing variety of environments. The trends of innovation described in the second half of this chapter are the key to understanding the changes described in the first part. This section will examine the main stages in the spread of agrarian civilizations over 4,000 years.

In 3000 BCE, agrarian civilization existed only in Mesopotamia and Egypt. By 2000 BCE, city-states had appeared in Sudan, to the south of Egypt (the powerful city-state of Yam, or Kerma), and had spread even more widely in Mesopotamia. During the reign of Sargon of Akkad (who ruled from ca. 2350 BCE for ca. 50 years), we have the first evidence for a new stage in state formation: the appearance of a state controlling several different city-states and their hinterlands.14 Sargon claimed to feed 5,400 men every day, a figure that may indicate the size of his retinue.15 Using what may have been the world’s first standing army, he defeated rival city-states. Then, instead of merely exacting tributes from them, he incorporated them into his own empire by demolishing their walls and appointing his own sons as ensis, or governors. He also supported trade networks that reached throughout Mesopotamia and as far as central Asia and the Indus valley, as well as through Egypt and into sub-Saharan Africa. Mesopotamia acted as a main hub for these networks, but the density of settlement and the scale of political power under Akkadian rule probably also make it the first ever center of gravity of a regional network of exchange.

What it meant to be at the center of these widespread networks of exchange, where wealth and information were pooled in huge quantities, is suggested by this description of the Akkadian capital, Agade, from early in the second millennium:



In those days the dwellings of Agade were filled with gold,

its bright-shining houses were filled with silver,

into its granaries were brought copper, tin, slabs of

lapis lazuli, its silos bulged (?) at the sides …

its quay where the boats docked were all bustle …

its walls reached skyward like a mountain …

the gates—like the Tigris emptying its water into the sea,

holy Inanna opened its gates.16





By 2000 BCE, agrarian civilizations also existed in Crete and in the Hittite civilization of Anatolia. In the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus River, a distinctive agrarian civilization appeared late in the third millennium. The Harappan civilization, like that of Sumer, was founded on the wealth and power of a number of large cities supported by irrigation agriculture in an arid alluvial plain. It had trading and cultural contacts with central Asia and Sumer, but its writing systems and artistic styles, like those of Egypt, seem quite distinctive. So it may be reasonable to regard the Harappan civilization as one of several regional hubs in a world system that also included the agrarian civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean.17 The Harappan civilization declined in the first half of the second millennium. Its fall may have been the result of invasions from the north, or ecological problems linked to overirrigation, or shifts in the river systems on which it was founded.

In the second millennium, the center of gravity of Mesopotamian civilizations shifted north to Babylonia and, eventually, to Assyria. Babylon’s gravitational pull made it one of the largest of all early cities, with a population perhaps exceeding 200,000 people.18 Here, Hammurabi established a new imperial state ca. 1792 BCE. His law code, with its 282 laws carved onto forty-nine basalt columns, provides the earliest detailed written evidence about legal and bureaucratic structures (see figure 10.2). Meanwhile, expanding trade networks in the Mediterranean spread the technologies and styles of Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilization right around the Mediterranean shores. This expanding zone included the Aegean world of the Homeric epics. Egyptian trade networks also extended southward into Sudan and sub-Saharan Africa. In this way, there emerged a single region of exchanges embracing Mesopotamia, much of the Mediterranean shore, parts of sub-Saharan Africa, central Asia, and parts of the Indian subcontinent.

This system of exchanges, with its center of gravity in Mesopotamia but with links to hub regions in Egypt and Sudan, central Asia, and northern India, was the largest of several networks in the Afro-Eurasian world zone; that zone, in turn, was the largest interconnected region on Earth. So, on general principles alone, we should expect Afro-Eurasia to be the world zone in which processes of collective learning were most intense and innovation most rapid. Mesopotamia’s position at the hub of Afro-Eurasia’s exchange networks may explain the central role played by this region in Afro-Eurasian history and world history in general, from the earliest period of state formation until the fundamental changes of the past half millennium displaced it from its central position.

But Mesopotamia was never the only center of gravity, even within the Afro-Eurasian world zone. During the second millennium BCE, agrarian civilizations emerged along the Yellow River in northern China. There is both archaeological and literary evidence that by 1600 BCE, a system of warring regional city-states covered much of northern and western China, reaching as far south as the Yangtze River. Many had wealthy and powerful rulers and some had literate bureaucracies. In the fourteenth century BCE, An-yang became a major ritual center for the semilegendary Shang dynasty, which claimed authority over many subordinate city-states. Modern research suggests that historians may have exaggerated the authority of Shang rulers over other regions, simply because their records are the only ones to survive. Nevertheless, Shang kings led armies of up to 13,000 men, which were supplied with mass-produced weapons and clothing from state factories. They also built huge and elaborate tombs, which often contained human sacrifices. The Zhou dynasty, from ca. 1050 to 221 BCE, presided over an early period of loose unity, followed by many centuries during which North China was controlled by more than a hundred independent kingdoms of various sizes; these were dominated by a core group of seven great “central states,” the zhongguo, all near the central Yellow River. During the first millennium BCE, North China emerged as a second major center of gravity within the Afro-Eurasian world zone. The demographic, technological, and administrative foundations were laid for the Qin and former Han Empires (221–207 BCE and 207–8 BCE), and the technological, artistic, and intellectual foundations of traditional Chinese civilization were established.

Was the Chinese world system totally separate from those of northern India and Mesopotamia? The appearance, beginning ca. 4000 BCE, of mobile, pastoralist cultures that engaged in systems of exchange reaching right across the Inner Eurasian steppes means that there were at least indirect contacts between all regions of Eurasia throughout the era of agrarian civilizations.19 We know that languages, technologies (such as the wheel and chariot), lifeways (including the basic technologies of pastoralism itself), and perhaps also methods of working bronze, as well as crops and staples such as wheat and barley (going east) and chicken and millet (going west), spread through the steppes during the third and second millennia. The appearance ca. 2000 BCE of a new hub region in the “Oxus” civilization—a cluster of trading city-states in central Asia, with links to Sumer and China as well as northern India—suggests that such exchanges were already significant 4,000 years ago, for central Asia is the natural hub for trans-Eurasian exchanges. Whether trans-Eurasian exchanges were significant enough to justify the claim that there existed a single Afro-Eurasian system by 2000 BCE remains a matter of debate.20 We can be certain, though, that by this time no region of agrarian civilization anywhere in Eurasia was totally isolated from other regions.

In the first millennium BCE, the power and reach of agrarian empires in Afro-Eurasia increased decisively. The Assyrian Empire, based in northern Mesopotamia, dominated that region between the tenth and seventh centuries. The Achaemenid Empire, created in the sixth century by Cyrus the Great, was much larger than any earlier agrarian empire. Its position in Persia—at the center of networks of exchange reaching from Africa through Mesopotamia and eastward to India, central Asia, and China—presumably explains the enduring importance of Persia and Mesopotamia in Afro-Eurasian history. But the aridity of large parts of Persia also explains why this region always played the role of hub better than that of the center of gravity.

In the shadow of these great empires, agrarian civilizations spread around the Mediterranean and through Egypt into modern Sudan and Ethiopia. These new regions of agrarian civilization laid the foundations for the Greek, Carthaginian, Roman, and Sudanic Empires. At first, the newer regions of agrarian civilization consisted of small, competing states, many of which engaged in trade as well as conquest. But over time, some of these local hub regions turned into centers of gravity as well. The astonishing conquests of Alexander the Great, between 334 and 323 BCE, created a vast, if ephemeral, empire that included Greece, all of the Persian Empire, much of central Asia, and much of northern India. Alexander’s empire embraced the entire hub region of Afro-Eurasia’s extensive exchange networks. As it collapsed, regional dynasties, all touched by Hellenic culture, emerged in Persia, Egypt, and central Asia, and also farther west, in Italy and North Africa. The spread of agrarian civilizations around the Mediterranean laid the foundations for a new imperial system, under Rome. Roman expansion beyond Italy began with the conquest of Sicily in 241 BCE and with Rome’s century-long duel with a second regional hub, Carthage, during the Punic Wars (264–146 BCE). At its height, before it split at the end of the fourth century CE, the Roman Empire controlled most of the Mediterranean, as well as huge colonies in the agrarian regions of Europe.

In the first half of the first millennium BCE, stimulated in part by new contacts with the Mediterranean world, agrarian civilizations also reappeared in the north of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the rice-growing lands along the Ganges River. Here, significant regional hubs appeared, and eventually a regional center of gravity. The greatest Indian empire of the first millennium BCE, the Mauryan Empire (ca. 320–185 BCE), controlled most of the subcontinent; not for many centuries after this was a single ruler to control as much territory as the Emperor Ashoka (r. 268–233 BCE). Nevertheless, the emergence of densely populated civilizations in India created a new center of gravity that stimulated the appearance of new networks of exchange through the southern seas, beginning late in the first millennium BCE. As Lynda Shaffer has suggested, Indian exports of cotton and crystallized sugar, Indian control of the trade in Indonesian gold and Moluccan spices, and Indian developments in religion (particularly Buddhism) and in mathematics had an influence that reached around the huge arc from East Africa to South China. This process Shaffer has described as “Southernization,” by analogy with the more familiar term Westernization.21

Late in the first millennium BCE, the agrarian civilizations of eastern, southern, and western Eurasia became more closely linked than ever before. Two developments bound several Eurasian centers of gravity more closely into a Eurasia-wide system of exchange. The first was a sharp increase in traffic along the Silk Roads after the Achaemenid rulers of Persia extended their influence into central Asia in the sixth century, and the Chinese government conquered Sinkiang early in the first century and began to actively promote trade with India, Persia, and the Mediterranean. The second development was the expansion of sea trade between Southwest Asia, India, and Southeast Asia, as sailors learned how to exploit the monsoon winds. These changes led to increased exchanges of trade goods, religious and technological ideas, and even diseases right across the Afro-Eurasian landmass. To the south of Egypt, the emergence of a significant state in Kush (in modern Sudan), which was briefly powerful enough to conquer most of Egypt (712–664 BCE), marks a significant stage in the incorporation of parts of sub-Saharan Africa into these larger networks.

In the first millennium CE, Afro-Eurasian networks were dominated by agrarian civilizations in the Mediterranean (with capitals at Rome and then Byzantium), Mesopotamia or Persia (the Parthian, Sassanid, and Abbasid Empires), India, and China (Han, Tang, and Song dynasties). Of these, perhaps the most influential were those that held the hub region of Mesopotamia and Persia—especially in the Islamic era, when Mesopotamia became once again a clearinghouse for goods, for technological ideas from the lateen sail to papermaking to the symbol for zero to new crops, and for new religious ideas incorporating elements from several different regions of Afro-Eurasia. But the Indian subcontinent may have played a greater part in these exchanges than is usually recognized, particularly by mediating the increasingly important seaborne trades from East Africa to the Mediterranean, and through Southeast Asia to China. As Shaffer has suggested, the Islamic world inherited the intellectual and technological traditions of the Mediterranean world and those of the Indian subcontinent, while many significant developments in the religious, commercial, and technological history of Tang and Song China, from the import of Buddhism to the use of zero in mathematics to the introduction of Champa rice, may reflect Indian influences.22 During this period, agrarian civilization spread to four new areas of the Afro-Eurasian landmass: South China, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe. In all these regions, dense agrarian populations provided the demographic foundations for new cities and states or for the establishment of colonial empires by established civilizations.

South of Egypt, the Sudanese state of Kush was supplanted in the third century CE by the Ethiopian state of Axum, near the Red Sea, which controlled many of the trade routes linking Arabia with sub-Saharan Africa, and India with the Mediterranean.23 In the sixth century, Axum converted to Christianity. In West Africa, the arid lands of the Sahara began to link the Mediterranean with sub-Saharan Africa, much as the steppes of Eurasia connected the Mediterranean world with China. Camels appeared in the Sahara early in the first millennium CE, and from the third century on, camel-riding pastoralists and traders such as the ancestors of the Tuareg linked sub-Saharan Africa into Mediterranean trade networks by carrying the gold and copper of West Africa (and sometimes its slaves) northward. The wealth of these trade networks triggered the appearance of cities and states within regions already settled by farmers relying mainly on sorghum, millet, and sometimes rice. The empire of Wagadu, led by a ruler called the Ghana, formed as a regional hub well before the ninth century CE on the borders of modern Mali and Mauretania. The trading empire of Kanem was founded north of Lake Chad in the mid–ninth century. Its ruling dynasty, the Sayf, survived for 1,000 years.

Usually, where new regions of agrarian civilization appear, it is easy to detect the influence of nearby centers of gravity—northern Chinese in South China and Vietnam, Indian in Southeast Asia, Mediterranean and Mesopotamian (later Islamic) in sub-Saharan Africa, Roman and Byzantine in western and eastern Europe, respectively. Such influences are clearest in South China, where populations expanded in a region long controlled by dynasties from North China. Whereas the north of China included more than three-quarters of the empire’s population in 1 CE, by 1300 it included less than a quarter. At the western end of the Eurasian landmass a similar shift occurred, but this time northward into Europe.

Many regions continued to resist the spread of agrarian civilizations. Where the technological and ecological preconditions for dense settlement did not exist, traditional communities survived much longer, as is demonstrated most clearly in those areas (such as the Eurasian steppes) where agrarian civilization did not spread because they lacked dense farming populations.24 In the lands that became Rus’ and were later incorporated in the empire of Muscovy, farming had been practiced in only a few regions, including parts of modern Ukraine, since the early agrarian era. The region’s harsh climates and the presence of warlike pastoralists prevented the formation of farming populations dense enough to support cities or states. Instead, farming communities remained isolated and weak, which made them easy prey for tribute takers such as the Scythians, described so well by Herodotus. Then, from the middle of the first millennium CE onward, new crops (including rye) and the use of metal plows, as well as overpopulation in eastern Europe, led to widespread immigration into the lands between Europe and the Urals. As in West Africa, dense settlement attracted outside traders. These came from the Eurasian steppes or from the Baltic and traded with central Asia and Byzantium. They created a number of regional states, the earliest of which was the Khazar Empire, whose capital lay north of the Caspian Sea. Along the routes from the Baltic to Byzantium, a number of petty city-states were linked under a single dynasty in the tenth century, creating the formidable power of Kievan Rus’. Given its early trade links with central Asia and Baghdad, Kievan Rus’ could easily have converted to Islam and become an integral part of the Islamic world. But in 988 its grand prince, Vladimir (whom we met in chapter 9), converted to Orthodox Christianity; from then on, Rus’ and its successor states belonged, culturally at least, to the world of Christendom.

Except for the unsuccessful Viking attempt to settle in Newfoundland ca. 1000 CE, there were no significant contacts between Eurasia and the Americas before the sixteenth century CE, which is why it is reasonable to treat the Americas as a distinct world zone.25 Nevertheless, in the Americas, too, agrarian civilizations spread, came into contact with each other, and eventually created embryonic world systems. In Mesoamerica, as we have seen, the first agrarian civilizations appeared among the Olmec in the middle of the second millennium BCE, though some scholars would argue that the Olmec did not create true states. Nevertheless, they left a legacy in the cultural traditions of all later civilizations of Mesoamerica. True states had certainly appeared by the middle of the first millennium BCE, but it was not until the middle of the first millennium CE that there emerged imperial states based farther north, in Mexico. The history of Teotihuacán suggests how rapidly large imperial structures could appear once the appropriate foundations existed. It also reminds us how fragile early states could be. Teotihuacán, about 50 kilometers north of modern Mexico City, consisted of no more than a few small villages in 500 BCE. From 150 BCE it grew swiftly. Three centuries later, it had a population of ca. 60,000 to 80,000. Its growth—like that of the Anatolian city of Çatal Hüyük, which had flourished 6,000 years earlier—may have been based on the trade in obsidian, the premetallic equivalent of steel. At its height, ca. 500 CE, Teotihuacán had a population of 100,000 to 200,000 people, and its monumental architecture was as grand as anything that could be found in Afro-Eurasia (see figure 10.3).26 Teotihuacán was supported by a network of nearby villages and towns, which grew crops using irrigation agriculture and chinampa systems (described below). But it also depended on foodstuffs imported along extensive trade networks embracing a larger, Mesoamerican world system. So it clearly counts as a regional hub, and perhaps even as the first American center of gravity. Then, between 600 and 700 CE, Teotihuacán collapsed. Overexploitation of the land as a result of rapid population growth may have ruined the ecology of the region, while rival towns may have cut off the trade networks that supplied it or even invaded and sacked the city. Within fifty years of its collapse, there was nothing left but a few villages. A source from the colonial period describes how the leaders of the city fled, taking “the writings, the books, the paintings; they carried away all the crafts, the castings of metals.”27

In the contemporary cultures of the Maya, in the lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula to the south, there appeared a number of regional centers linked into the same networks of exchange as Teotihuacán. These collapsed at about the same time, probably as a result of overpopulation, may be linked to climatic changes that undermined the fertility of regional farmlands. From late in the first millennium, urbanization and state building intensified in central Mexico. These processes culminated, eventually, in the creation of the Aztec Empire in the fifteenth century. In 1519 its capital, Tenochtitlán, contained between 200,000 and 300,000 people, and several other cities in the Valley of Mexico were almost as large. Here is how Cortés’s lieutenant, Bernai Díaz del Castillo, described his first sight of Tenochtitlán in 1519:



Next morning, we came to a broad causeway and continued our march towards Iztapalapa. And when we saw all those cities and villages built in the water, and other great towns on dry land, and that straight and level causeway leading to Mexico [Tenochtitlán], we were astounded. These great towns and cues and buildings rising from the water, all made of stone, seemed like an enchanted vision from the tale of Amadis. Indeed, some of our soldiers asked whether it was not all a dream. It was all so wonderful that I do not know how to describe this first glimpse of things never heard of, seen or dreamed of before.28





Figure 10.3. Teotihuacán. The great city-state of Teotihuacán, 40 km outside of Mexico City, flourished from ca. 200 BCE to ca. 650 CE. At its height, its population may have reached 200,000, making it one of the largest cities in the world. It was certainly the largest and most powerful city in the Americas. It had contacts with many other parts of Mesoamerica, and its political traditions influenced later Mesoamerican states, including that of the Aztecs. From Brian M. Fagan, People of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory, 7th ed. (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), p. 574: from Urbanization at Teotihuacán, Mexico, éd.

Up to 2 million people lived in and around Tenochtitlán in 1500. They were supported by raised-field farming, known as the chinampa system. Early settlers on the swampy lands around Tenochtitlán built up mounds of river vegetation and mud, held together with “fences” of willows. They cleared canals between the mounds and fertilized them with mud from the canal beds, with rotting vegetation, and with human refuse; by farming them carefully it was possible to raise up to seven crops a year. The diets of these early settlers were supplemented with fish and waterfowl.29

In South America, the first agrarian civilizations appeared in the first millennium CE, in a period of rapid population growth and urbanization. The first great empire to emerge here was that of the Incas, which was assembled in the fifteenth century CE. The agrarian civilizations of South America had significant contacts with Mesoamerica, but whether these were sufficient to create a single world system remains a matter of dispute. In North America, after the widespread adoption of maize cultivation late in the first millennium CE, populations grew rapidly; all the now-familiar signs of an agrarian civilization in embryo began to appear in the so-called Mississippian cultures. At its center were large towns with elevated ceremonial centers sometimes as high as 30 meters. Centers such as Cahokia, which may have had 30,000 to 40,000 people living nearby in 1200 CE, were similar to the ceremonial centers of the Eridu period in Sumer. Mississippian communities were probably organized in large-scale chiefdoms; but because most of their people still lived in small agricultural communities, it does not count as a fully developed agrarian civilization. Maize sustained population growth in this region, so it may be appropriate to regard the Mississippian region as a regional hub within a wider American network of exchanges whose centers of gravity lay in Mesoamerica and South America.

If it is viewed as such a hub, we can say that by the second millennium CE, the various regions of agrarian civilization throughout the world had become linked, through expanding networks of exchange, into two major world systems: Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. Of these, the Afro-Eurasian system was older, larger, more densely populated, and more powerful. The extent of its power became abundantly clear in the sixteenth century when the two regions finally came into contact. In neither of the other two world zones did agrarian civilizations exist, even though in some farming regions, including Papua New Guinea and islands such as Tonga and Hawai’i, there did emerge powerful chiefdoms, some on the verge of statehood.

Very loosely, we can quantify the expansion of agrarian civilizations over 4,000 years. Rein Taagepera has tried to measure the areas ruled by “imperial systems” of Afro-Eurasia at different dates. By imperial systems, he means large political entities that include several agrarian states. Though this definition would exclude some regions of agrarian civilization, it may still provide a rough index of the political and military expansion of agrarian civilizations in Afro-Eurasia. For each period, Taagepera estimates the total area controlled by state systems, and compares these estimates with the areas controlled by state systems today. Table 10.2 summarizes his data.

Three eras stand out. The first extends from the third millennium to the middle of the first millennium BCE. In this period, agrarian civilizations could be found only in the Afro-Eurasian zone, and they directly controlled just 2 percent of the areas ruled by state systems today. The second era begins in the middle of the first millennium BCE, with the appearance of the Achaemenid Empire, and extends to 1000 CE. By its end, agrarian civilizations controlled between 6 percent and 13 percent of the area controlled by modern states. During this period, agrarian civilizations appeared also in the Americas, but the areas they controlled were far smaller than in Afro-Eurasia. There is a further sudden increase in the area ruled by large empires after 1000 CE, with the rise of the Mongol Empire and the European empires of the past 500 years. American empires also expanded after 1000 CE, but they contributed much less to this rapid expansion. In 1500, the Inca Empire ruled ca. 2 megameters and the Aztec Empire only 0.22 megameters. Inclusion of regions of incipient state formation in the Pacific, such as Hawai’i and Tonga, would make no real difference to these calculations.30

Despite this long history of expansion, it is important to remember that even in the seventeenth century, just 300 years ago, state systems controlled no more than one-third of the lands incorporated within states in the twenty-first century. Even if they had come to dominate networks of exchange throughout the world and include most of the world’s population, they never controlled the world in the way of modern capitalist states.

Accumulation, Innovation, and Collective Learning




The spread of agrarian civilization was made possible by a continuation of the processes of intensification that had begun early in the Holocene. Rates of innovation were thus a crucial determinant of the pace and nature of change in this era. What factors governed rates of innovation? Where was innovation most intensive, and how rapid was innovation in the era of agrarian civilizations ?

Scale itself was a source of innovation, as the increasing size of exchange networks generated new intellectual and commercial synergies. But more specifically, three other factors shaped the pace and nature of innovation in this period: population growth, the expanding activity of states, and increasing commercialization and urbanization. I will describe these three sources of innovation separately, even though in practice they were intertwined. Though each contributed to innovation and growth in the long run, in the medium- and short-term each could also undermine growth. To contemporaries, these cyclical patterns over shorter time spans were usually the most apparent, which is why premodern historians have characteristically thought in terms of cycles rather than long-term trends. As we will see, the impact of these three sources of innovation was ambiguous and uncertain, characteristics that help explain why innovation was so much slower in the era of agrarian civilizations than it is in the modern era.

Scale as a Source of Innovation At the most general level, the size and variety of information networks, as well as the intensity of exchanges within them, shaped average rates of innovation over long periods. The greater the volume and diversity of information being exchanged, the more likely it was that such exchanges would result in innovations, both large and small. In the period considered here, it is clear that in the Afro-Eurasian world zone, and to a lesser extent in the Americas, too, information networks expanded in both scale and variety. They also linked societies of many different types, so that innovations introduced by barbarian farmers in northern Europe could spread to the Mediterranean, while technologies of horse riding first developed in the Eurasian steppes spread to China or Mesopotamia, and metalworking technologies and crops spread throughout Afro-Eurasia, in areas of agrarian civilization and beyond their borders.

Improvements in transportation and communication technologies enabled innovations to spread more rapidly and more widely (see tables 10.3 and 10.4). The secondary products revolution was of fundamental importance in increasing the intensity and speed of exchanges within the Afro-Eurasian zone, as it made available new forms of transportation perhaps as early as 4000 BCE. The harnessing of oxen, asses, and horses may in turn have encouraged the evolution of wheeled transport. At sea, while no European mariners achieved the navigational sophistication of Polynesian navigators, the speed, reliability, and precision of their navigation undoubtedly increased, particularly in the first millennium CE. The building of major roads also stimulated transportation from China to Persia to Rome. The main innovations in forms of communication were associated with the evolution of scripts and methods of writing. But some empires, including the Achaemenids and the Han, organized long-distance courier systems (as did the Incas much later in Peru). Many societies also constructed rudimentary early-warning systems based on the lighting of signal fires, so that information could sometimes travel large distances with great speed.

The size and diversity of Afro-Eurasia and its relatively advanced systems of communication help explain why rates of innovation were faster here than in the other world zones of the Holocene era. Here the pool of information being exchanged was greater and more varied than anywhere else, so that the accumulation and exchange of new technologies proceeded more rapidly than ever before. But in the Americas, too, the emergence of large zones of agrarian civilization and extensive trade networks ensured that similar processes were at work. Information networks were large; they exchanged knowledge between regions with different lifeways, crops, technologies, and ecologies; and in their turn, ecological innovations accelerated the intensity and speed of exchanges. Literacy was part of the process here, as was the creation of impressive roadways; but what was lacking was the entire complex of innovations associated in the Afro-Eurasian zone with the secondary products revolution.

Population Growth In the early agrarian era, population growth and technological change reinforced each other. In the era of agrarian civilizations, this relationship remained a major source of innovation and accumulation—particularly in regions of independent pastoralists or peasants, whose communities generated many important innovations, especially in agriculture and the use of livestock.

Between 3000 BCE and 1 CE, world populations rose from ca. 50 to ca. 250 million (see tables 6.2 and 6.3). This expansion marks a gentle acceleration in the demographic dynamism of the early agrarian era, suggesting that the creation of agrarian civilizations had a significant, but not revolutionary, impact on population growth. The long demographic trends create the illusion of steady growth. But on the scale of lifetimes or even centuries, the pattern that stands out is cyclical—a pattern of rise and fall. Historians have become increasingly aware of these large cycles of expansion and decline, though they differ on the questions of their periodicity and their causes. In a famous study first published in 1966, The Peasants of Languedoc, the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie traced centuries-long cycles of boom and bust in the Languedoc region and the early modern French economy as a whole. These cycles affected all aspects of life: Robert Lopez described them as an “alternation of crest, trough and crest” that “can be observed not only in the economic field, but in almost every aspect of life: literature and art, philosophy and thought, politics and law also were affected, though not all to the same extent.”31 Le Roy Ladurie described these cycles, memorably, as “the respiration of a social structure.”32 One reason for their immense influence was the overwhelming importance of the agrarian sector. Where most forms of production relied on organic materials and energy sources, agricultural output set limits to the production not just of foodstuffs but also of clothing, housing, energy, productive implements, and even parchment and paper.33 Because agriculture was the main motor of economic growth in the agrarian era, rates of innovation in agriculture dominated medium-term economic, political, and even cultural cycles. As populations rose, so did production, so did demand, and so did the supply of labor. Rising populations created the buoyancy needed to sustain expanding systems of trade, larger states, the building of monumental architecture, and the patronage of artists and artisans, which in turn stimulated cultural change. Agrarian civilizations flourished in such periods economically, politically, and artistically. Periods of declining populations undermined all these activities. As a result, the movements of economic expansion and contraction, of urbanization, of trade, and of political power are all linked to the same underlying rhythms. Long-term accumulation took place underneath these cycles in ways that were often invisible to contemporaries. Only in the long view of world history is it evident that each cycle normally rose higher than its predecessor.

What was true of early modern France was true of agrarian civilizations in general. To get some feeling for the cycles described by Le Roy Ladurie, it may help to look at population growth in several distinct regions of agrarian civilization. Figure 10.4 graphs the rough population figures calculated by J. R. Biraben for China, the Indian subcontinent, and Europe between 400 BCE and 1900 CE.34 It is immediately obvious that in each region there are periods of rising population followed by periods of decline—sometimes drastic decline. How should we explain these medium-term rhythms, which seem to have shaped the histories of all regions of agrarian civilization? Though they blend several overlapping trends in population growth, harvest fluctuations, warfare, and commerce and state policy, one set of factors dominated them: a negative feedback cycle linking innovation (particularly in agriculture), population growth, ecological degradation, declining health, and increasing conflict, leading to population decline (see figure 10.5).





Figure 10.4. Malthusian cycles in China, India, and Europe, 400 BCE–1900 CE. This graph shows the Malthusian pattern of rising populations, punctuated by sudden downturns, that was typical of the history of the agrarian era. From J. R. Biraben, “Essai sur l’évolution du nombre des homme,” Population 34 (1979): 16.



The British pioneer of population studies, Thomas Malthus, was one of the first to analyze the relations between population growth and available resources. At the end of the eighteenth century, he argued that any species, regarded purely mathematically, can multiply at a geometric rate, on the upward-curving trend familiar from compound interest. Yet the resources available to feed each species normally increase only at an arithmetic rate, on a straight-line trend. This means, as we have seen in the final section of chapter 5, that available resources set the real limits to population growth. In the natural world, available resources are determined by the niches available to a particular species. But humans are different because they keep innovating: they explore, modify, improve, and even create new niches. Thus limits to human population growth are set only by the number and productivity of the niches that innovation has made available in any particular epoch. Every time there are significant innovations, the ceiling to population growth is lifted. When significant innovations occur, populations can climb until they overshoot the new ceiling. Then there will be a crash. The land will give out; famine will take the hungry; disease will take the malnourished; and wars, often launched by governments competing for scarce resources, will take soldiers and the people through whose cities or villages they move. Eventually human populations will settle down to a new level. Innovation ensured that each cycle normally reached a higher level than its predecessor, but innovation was normally too slow to prevent an eventual collapse within each cycle, as populations outstripped available resources.





Figure 10.5. A negative feedback cycle: population, agriculture, and the environment.



There is an important ecological component to these rhythms, for population crashes were often triggered by overexploitation of fragile environments, particularly in areas where population growth depended on the irrigation of arid lands. This is the same rhythm we see in the evolution of excessively virulent parasites. In the era of agrarian civilizations, it is most apparent where it led to the collapse of entire civilizations. At the end of the third millennium BCE, the drying of southern Mesopotamia, joined with salinization caused by excessive irrigation, undermined the ecological foundations of Sumer. One sign in the archaeological record of increased salinity is the inhabitants’ increased use of barley, which tolerates salt better than wheat does. Eventually, though, populations collapsed, falling from ca. 630,000 in 1900 BCE to ca. 270,000 by 1600 BCE, not to rise again until a millennium later under the Achaemenids.35 Sadly, the same pattern was to be repeated again in the later history of Mesopotamia (see figure 10.6). A similar fate probably accounts for the collapse of the Mayan civilization at the end of the eighth century CE (see map 10.1). Michael D. Coe observes:



The Classic Maya population of the southern lowlands had probably increased beyond the carrying capacity of the land, no matter what system of agriculture was in use. There is mounting evidence for massive deforestation and erosion throughout the Central Area, only alleviated in a few favorable zones by dry slope terracing. In short, overpopulation and environmental degradation had advanced to a degree only matched by what is happening in many of the poorest tropical countries today. The Maya apocalypse, for such it was, surely had ecological roots.36





In all these cases, new technologies or opportunities stimulated population growth, but neither the technological nor the managerial know-how was sufficient to support growth indefinitely. Innovation was sufficient in all these cases to initiate growth, but not to sustain it or avoid overexploitation and ecological collapse. This characteristic pattern of slow innovation (“technological drift,” in Eric Jones’s term) lagging behind potential rates of population growth is the primary explanation for the steplike cycles that can be observed throughout the agrarian era.37 I will refer to these as Malthusian cycles.

Disease is as much a part of these cycles as environmental degradation. The evolving relations between humans and diseases is easiest to see in Afro-Eurasia—perhaps, as Jared Diamond has argued, because only there did humans live intimately enough with domestic animals to swap disease pathogens with them.38 The figures in table 6.3 suggest that world populations grew exceptionally fast between 1000 and 1 BCE. (These figures are dominated by those for Eurasia, so any conclusions we draw from them apply mainly to Eurasia.) In the two thousand years from 3000 to 1000 BCE, the doubling time for world populations dropped from ca. 1,630 years in the early agrarian era to about 1,580; but in the period from 1000 to 1 BCE, it dropped to a mere 945 years. These calculations reinforce the impression revealed by many other trends: the first millennium BCE was one of exceptionally rapid growth, at least in much of the Afro-Eurasian world zone, and then growth slowed. Why?

William McNeill has suggested the most elegant explanation for this acceleration in population growth in Eurasia. It had to do with changing human relations with parasites, both large and small. “Macro-parasites” (tribute-taking states) learned to take tribute in less violent and more predictable ways; while population growth and epidemiological exchanges enabled each region to establish more stable relations with local diseases:



During the first millennium B.C. in three important centers of human population [China, India, and the Mediterranean], the balances between macro- and micro-parasitism adjusted themselves in such a fashion as to allow persistent population growth and territorial expansion of civilized types of society. As a result, by the beginning of the Christian era, the civilizations of China, India, and the Mediterranean had attained a size and mass comparable to that of the more anciently civilized Middle East.39





Map 10.1 The American world zone before Columbus.





Political systems were getting better at judging appropriate levels of tribute exaction, and people (and their immune systems) were getting better at coping with infectious diseases.

Sadly, this argument has a flip side. When regions previously isolated from each other came into regular contact, they swapped diseases. And this exchange could prove devastating in regions that lacked the necessary immunities. For a time, plagues and epidemics could reverse or slow population growth on both sides of the old epidemiological frontier. In the first millennium of the modern era, up to 1000 CE, world populations did not rise at all. This demographic downturn is of fundamental importance, yet it has been largely ignored by historians. There may have been earlier periods of similarly slow growth, though the available evidence makes it hard to be sure. In the Mediterranean world system we find hints of significant demographic and political collapses late in the third millennium and toward the end of the second millennium BCE. Whatever the causes of these earlier declines, McNeill has suggested that the stagnation of the first millennium CE was caused by increasing traffic along the major exchange networks of Eurasia, such as the Silk Roads and the sea routes linking the Mediterranean and South and East Asia. Disease bacteria traveled these routes as well as people, goods, and techniques, causing massive and recurring plagues as each region faced new diseases for which its populations lacked biological or cultural antibodies. McNeill refers to this process as the “closing of the Eurasian ecumene.”40

New diseases had their greatest impact at the extremes of the Eurasian world system, in the Mediterranean and China, where earlier contacts had been most restricted. They had less impact in Mesopotamia and India, regions that lay closer to the hub of the Eurasian network of exchanges and were therefore more disease-hardened. McNeill argues that more stable relations with regional disease bacteria had probably evolved within each of the regions of denser settlement by the first millennium BCE, which may explain the more rapid population growth of that millennium; the swapping of disease bacteria between the major civilizations of Eurasia may help explain the slow growth of the first millennium CE.

The relative immunity of the hub regions may lie behind the increasing significance in the first millennium CE of the Sassanid and then Islamic Empires, both with their heartlands in Persia and Mesopotamia, and of the Gupta Empire (320–535 CE) in northern India. But people suffered in the far east and the far west. As McNeill argues, “In the first Christian centuries, … Europe and China, the two least disease-experienced civilizations of the Old World, were in an epidemiological position analogous to that of Amerindians in the later age: vulnerable to socially disruptive attack by new infectious diseases.”41 It seems likely that in the Mediterranean world, diseases such as smallpox, measles, and rubella did not exist before the first millennium CE.42 In Rome, large-scale epidemics struck first in 165 CE. They probably took the form of smallpox, but measles and bubonic plague appeared in succeeding centuries. The “plague of Justinian,” which struck Byzantium in 542–43, was almost certainly bubonic plague, as we have a detailed account of it from the historian Procopius.43 The plague recurred for at least the next two centuries.

These devastating bacteriological exchanges did more than alter demographic patterns. They also affected state structures and even religious and intellectual history. For example, population losses must have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. In China the picture is less clear, but there is evidence that severe infections, perhaps including smallpox and measles, broke out beginning in the middle of the second century CE. We also know that Chinese populations declined sharply, and that imperial political and ideological structures declined with them, during the period between the fall of the Han (220 CE) and the rise of the Tang dynasty (618 CE).44 Meanwhile, the populations of Mesopotamia, Iran, and probably northern India held up much better, and thus these regions flourished late in the first millennium CE. The Black Death of the fourteenth century marks a new phase in the interchange of disease vectors, and on that occasion the dominant disease was bubonic plague.

Other killers also slowed demographic accumulation in the era of agrarian civilizations. Most important of all was the linked trio of famine, warfare, and urbanization. We will examine these in later sections.

States as Sources of Accumulation Within the regions they controlled, states and cities were powerful concentrators of wealth and powerful sources of accumulation and innovation, for the strength of their rulers depended on their capacity to mobilize human and economic resources. Moreover, cities were, by their nature, important hubs for the exchange of ideas as well as goods. Yet cities and states could dampen innovation as well.

Though individual states also rose and fell, the long-term trends all indicate a sustained increase in the reach and power of the largest and most powerful states. Coupled with this was an increase in the number of smaller and more rudimentary state systems with limited bureaucracies and fragmented sovereignty, a type of political system often referred to as feudal, or simply as early states.45 No state in the era of agrarian civilizations had anything like the capacity of modern states to regulate the daily lives of their subjects. Most ruled through chains of intermediaries, with little knowledge of or interest in the lives of the majority of those they ruled. Yet undoubtedly states slowly got better at what they did, and managed their power with great skill and efficiency as their methods of predation became less virulent and more restrained.

TABLE 10.5. AREAS RULED BY PARTICULAR STATES AND EMPIRES





An indirect measure of the increasing power of states is the area ruled by the largest states. This trend has been roughly calculated by Rein Taagepera.46 The figures in table 10.5 suggest that there were three distinct eras.

First, from ca. 3000 to 600 BCE, even the largest state systems controlled no more than a megameter (1 megameter = 100,000 km2) of land. The earliest imperial system, created by Sargon of Akkad, covered ca. 0.6 megameters, while the Egyptian dynasties of the third millennium, its nearest rivals, controlled at their peak about 0.4 megameters. Sargon’s empire set a threshold that was not crossed until the middle of the second millennium when Pharaoh Thutmosis III of Egypt created a short-lived empire in Egypt and eastern Mesopotamia, which may have covered almost 1 megameter. In the thirteenth and twelfth centuries, the Shang dynasty in China may have ruled as large a territory

Second, in the sixth century of the first millennium BCE, the Achaemenid Empire set a new benchmark. At its height, it ruled ca. 5.5 megameters of territory. For the next 2,000 years, under the Achaemenids, Seleucids, Parthians, Sassanids, and Abbasids, Persia was to be the heart of vast land empires that controlled similar areas. These set the standard for imperial reach throughout this period. In India, in the third century BCE, the Mauryan Empire briefly ruled over more than 3 megameters. No later Indian empire reached this level again until the creation of the Mogul Empire in the sixteenth century CE. By the first century BCE, the Han dynasty in China had begun to rule an even larger territory than Persia (more than 6.0 megameters). The empire of Alexander the Great was vaster than that of the Persians, but more ephemeral. By the first century CE, the Roman Republic controlled an empire larger than 4 megameters. In the seventh and eighth centuries CE, the Islamic conquests created empires, based in Mesopotamia and Persia, that controlled about 10 megameters of Afro-Eurasia’s main hub region before they fragmented.

Third, with the remarkable exception of the Mongol Empire of the thirteenth century, which, at its peak controlled 25 megameters, and the much later example of the early modern European empires, which also controlled about 25 megameters of territory in the seventeenth century, 5 to 10 megameters remained the limit of most traditional empires. Not until the modern era did improved communications and transportation technologies, combined with modern military and bureaucratic techniques, make it possible to create even larger empires.

In the Americas, the growth of state systems followed parallel trends, but with a time lag of approximately two millennia. Agrarian civilizations similar in scale to those of third millennium Sumer or Egypt appeared late in the second or early in the first millennium BCE. The political threshold first crossed by the Achaemenid Empire was not breached in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans. In 1500 CE, the Incas ruled an area of ca. 2 megameters, while the Aztec Empire was much smaller, controlling an area of only ca. 0.22 megameters.47

Changes in religious thinking mirrored the increasing power and reach of state structures, for religions could underpin state power by mobilizing loyalty and justifying tributary exchanges, particularly where there were institutionalized churches. Religions in early agrarian civilizations, like those of the Paleolithic world, tended to be local or regional in their claims and influence.48 Their gods, like family members, were expected to protect particular tribes or cities and to smite their enemies. With the creation of the first empires, regional deities were incorporated into larger, more imperial pantheons; but religion remained a regional affair, tied closely to the fortunes of particular dynasties, cities, and empires. This connection can be seen in the religious art of Naram-Sin (ca. 2250–2220 BCE), the grandson of Sargon of Akkad, who is portrayed as a deity ruling over many other deities.

Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe, controlling populations with diverse belief systems and lifeways. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in the Mediterranean world. Their appearance persuaded the German existentialist philosopher Karl T Jaspers, in a world history first published in 1949, to name this period the “axial age.”49 A powerful indication of the growing links between different parts of Afro-Eurasia was the way these religions traveled along trade routes, with Buddhism traveling to China, along the Silk Roads, as well as Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity. Islam benefited from its control of the Mesopotamian hub region, and it eventually spread even more widely: westward to Spain, south to East Africa, east to central Asia and North China, and eventually east and south to India and large areas of Southeast Asia. Christianity, though successful in the Mediterranean region for a time, had to retreat before Islam for many centuries. Its time came late in the second millennium CE.

Tribute-taking states, like population growth, had a significant but contradictory impact on accumulation. On the positive side, they had good reason to encourage innovation and accumulation, in order to increase their own power and efficiency. Like viruses, they could take from their prey more or less efficiently, and more or less brutally. The most stable states and the wisest rulers protected the productive base of their societies by taxing lightly, maintaining basic infrastructure, upholding law and order, and encouraging growth in rural populations and agricultural output. Gentle taxation and stable rule could promote increased agricultural and artisanal production. But it was also important to stimulate growth in other ways by maintaining infrastructures such as roads and irrigation systems. The importance of such methods is a theme that crops up over and over again in the manuals of statecraft that appear in all Eurasian agrarian civilizations. Many ancient writers were concerned to describe and encourage less predatory and more sustainable forms of taxation. Thus, an eleventh-century CE Muslim prince from Tabaristan wrote in a book for his son, “Make it your constant endeavor to improve cultivation and to govern well; for understand this truth: the kingdom can be held by the army, and the army by gold; and gold is acquired through agricultural development and agricultural development through justice and equity. Therefore be just and equitable.”50 In a similar spirit, Chinese governments of the Song era ordered their officials to promote the use of more productive strains of rice in the south of the country. Earlier Chinese dynasties had invested huge amounts in the buildings of canals and improved roadways to ease the transportation of grain and other goods to the major cities. All governments whose populations depended on large irrigation works had to concern themselves with the maintenance of those systems.

States could stimulate accumulation in many other ways. Most tribute-taking states saw war as their central concern, because the conquest of neighboring societies was one of the quickest ways of acquiring new resources. So tribute-taking states always took great interest in military innovations. Sumerian governments traded in copper and tin because they needed bronze weaponry. Roman technology is remarkable in areas such as the building of bridges, aqueducts, and fortifications; the use of concrete; and the construction of machines of war such as catapults or siege engines, which were built using sophisticated systems of ratchets, pulleys, and gears. Han technology (and bureaucratic skill) was particularly impressive in such areas as fortification (as in China’s Great Wall), the mass production of weapons and armor, the mobilization of resources for war, and the building of canals to transport foodstuffs.

Rulers often tried to enhance their prestige by supporting large building projects. The technologies used to maintain and beautify the capital city of Rome were particularly impressive: “The Rome of 100 A.D.,” it has been suggested, “had better paved streets, sewage disposal, water supply, and fire protection than the capitals of civilized Europe in 1800.”51 Like the creation of large armies, these were projects that stimulated accumulation by encouraging trade and generating demand. Powerful states spent freely on large prestige projects, including cities such as the Achaemenid capital, Persepolis. Such projects were designed to overawe subjects and rivals, but they also provided employment and attracted merchants and artisans. In the pursuit of managerial efficiency, states also did much to promote improved forms of literacy, though usually only among their own officials. Changes that may have improved the effectiveness of bureaucracies include the introduction of alphabetic scripts in the cities of Phoenicia ca. 1000 BCE, as well as improvements in mathematics and astronomy, which gave states greater control over calendars and accounting. Larger and more efficient bureaucracies were also necessary to handle the large standing armies that began to be used at least from the time of the Assyrian Empire. Finally, stable government coupled with fiscal moderation encouraged peasants to produce larger surpluses and encouraged merchants to trade more extensively.

But while tribute-taking states often stimulated accumulation, they could also undermine it, sometimes severely. Indeed, the basic structures of agrarian civilizations ensured that this would be so. Tribute-taking elites could not exist unless primary producers had access to the land, for that was where most surplus resources were produced. So, in most agrarian civilizations, most people had access to land in some form. This broad allocation of productive resources limited the steepness of gradients of wealth and inhibited the concentration of resources in the hands of elite groups. It meant that though surplus wealth could be concentrated in the hands of governments and elite groups, the land, the fundamental productive resource in all agrarian societies, could not. Whatever symbolic claims elites might make to the land, they had to leave most of it in the hands of the peasant farmers who normally worked it. This requirement limited their ability to manage and supervise agricultural production. It also explains why tributary states could survive with such rudimentary bureaucracies: they left the most basic production tasks almost entirely to the skills and labor of rural households.

As Marx pointed out, these relationships explain why tribute-taking elites had to extract resources in ways that often inhibited innovation and depressed productivity.52 If peasants have enough land to support themselves, then they have little incentive to surrender the huge sums often demanded by elites. For precisely that reason, elites normally had to use the threat of force to extract surpluses. In the short or medium term, such threats, whether used to exact regular taxes or to exact new flows of wealth through conquest, were simply the most effective way of getting resources, because real growth in output usually occurred too slowly to interest rulers. This is why Moses Finley has argued, with only slight exaggeration, that “what passed for economic growth in antiquity was always achieved only by external expansion”53 In such an environment, it took an unusually far-sighted or confident ruler to invest large amounts in projects that required several decades to raise productivity levels. Faced with immediate crises, even the most able rulers became brutal and destructive predators. Rulers who were less able, or who were more desperate, used destructive fiscal methods as a matter of course, even when they or their advisers knew that they were undermining the bases of their own power. In Muscovite history, the reign of Ivan the Terrible offers a horrifying example of the dangers of excessive predation. After his death, the powerful Muscovite empire, which had been constructed over several centuries, came close to collapse in a period of civil war, famine, invasion, and depopulation known as the “Time of Troubles.” The collapse was caused largely by Ivan’s overpredatory policies, which drove peasants, the productive foundation of all agrarian civilizations, either to ruin or to flight.

Important consequences follow from these basic structural features of agrarian civilizations. First, elites in tribute-taking societies had to be specialists in coercion and management rather than in production. By and large, tribute-taking elites despised productive work and those who engaged in it, an attitude that left most of them ignorant of the productive technologies on which their wealth was based. The official and the warrior (managers and coercers) provided the models of elite lifeways, rather than the artisan, the peasant, or the merchant. Tributary elites were content, for the most part, to skim off what they needed, and to focus on the military and fiscal skills necessary to keep on skimming. Normally, they had to be wealth takers rather than wealth generators, and thus statecraft took precedence over economic calculation.54 Machiavelli’s descriptions of the strategic and tactical rules of this world are valuable despite an element of caricature:



A Prince, therefore, should have no other object or thought, nor acquire skill in anything, except war, its organization, and its discipline. The art of war is all that is expected of a ruler; and it is so useful that besides enabling hereditary princes to maintain their rule it frequently enables ordinary citizens to become rulers… . The first way to lose your state is to neglect the art of war; the first way to win a state is to be skilled in the art of war.





In such a world, it made sense for elite males to train themselves mainly in the exercise of coercion, rather than in intellectual or commercial activity Thus, time spent hunting or jousting was more useful than time spent in the countinghouse.



[The Prince] should never let his thoughts stray from military exercises, which he should pursue more vigorously in peace than in war. These exercises can be both physical and mental. As for the first, besides keeping his men well organized and trained he should always be out hunting, so accustoming his body to hardships and also learning some practical geography: how the mountains slope, how the valleys open, how the plains spread out.55





Such attitudes guaranteed that among tributary elites, violence was deployed with an unashamed exuberance rare in the industrialized world today, for they recognized it as the main instrument of rule. Nizam al-Mulk, the vizier of the Seljuk sultans, quoted the Abbasid caliph Ma’mun as follows: “I have two commanders of the guard who are occupied from morning till night in cutting off people’s heads, hanging people, chopping off hands and feet, giving the bastinado and putting men in prison.” And a twelfth-century French writer describes the joy of battle: “I tell you that I never eat or sleep or drink so well as when I hear the cry, ‘Up and at ‘em!’ from both sides, and when I hear the neighing of riderless horses in the brush and hear shouts of ‘Help! Help!’ and see men fall … and the dead pierced in the side by gaily-pennoned spears.”56

In some circumstances, elites operated at one remove from the exercise of violence, specializing instead in the management of coercion. In imperial China—where, from the time of the Qin dynasty (221–207 BCE), which founded the first unified imperial state, a large bureaucracy supervised armies and tax collectors—administrative and legal forms of coercion often won more prestige than physical coercion, and the ambitious spent more time studying than hunting. But what they studied was control, not farming or commerce.

At the same time, peasants (the primary producers) generally had little incentive to raise their productivity as long as they could survive, for increases in output could all too easily be skimmed off by their overlords. Stable and long-lived polities such as that of China thrived in part because they were rich enough and durable enough to maintain predictable and relatively light levels of taxation, which gave peasants a greater stake in productivity-raising innovations.57 But even the peasants of less predatory states had limited incentives to innovate. Normally, they lacked the financial resources, the ability to take risks, and the training necessary to experiment with new technologies.

All in all, as Joel Mokyr has argued, technological innovation is unlikely to happen quickly where those who work lack wealth, education, and prestige, and those who are wealthy, educated, and have prestige know nothing about productive work. In agrarian civilizations, tributary elites had significant control over networks of informational exchange, and their hostility to technological thought must have significantly slowed the circulation of innovations in productive techniques.58 To complete this vicious circle, slow growth rates themselves inhibited investment, for they meant that returns on investments could be expected only in the remote future, and few traditional rulers operated within such time frames. In a world of sluggish growth (by modern standards), investing in growth was far too slow a method of increasing revenues: conquest was normally a more promising gambit. In all these ways, the social and economic structures on which tributary states built their power slowed innovation in productive technologies.

Exchange, Commerce, and Urbanization Yet another motor of innovation in the era of agrarian civilizations was commercial exchange. Those who specialized in such commerce had to be expert in the manipulation of consensual systems of exchange even if they were usually willing to use force when they could get away with it. But force normally played a lesser role, either because commercial exchanges occurred beyond the reach of coercive forms of power or because they concerned goods that did not interest those with the power to coerce. Because efficiency as well as consent is normally more important than force in commercial exchanges, it has generally been assumed that commerce is more likely than tribute-taking to generate efficiency-raising innovations.

Though tribute-taking dominated exchanges within most states before the modern era, rulers had less power to control resources beyond their borders. So, except where backed up by invading armies, international exchanges were often more consensual. As a result, consensual commercial exchanges could normally reach further than exchanges controlled by tributary rulers. The growth of populations, the spread of agrarian civilizations, and improvements in means of communication all tended, over long periods, to increase the volume and extent of long-range commercial exchanges. These, in turn, hastened the spread of new productive military and managerial techniques and of new products within expanding world systems, because merchants usually had good reason to seek out innovations that might give them a commercial advantage. (It was pressures such as these that led states and merchants in western Eurasia to successfully pursue the secrets of silk making in the first millennium CE.) But commercial exchanges also developed a synergy of their own, for innovations from different regions often formed new and even more fruitful combinations in their new home, thereby enhancing the scale and extent of their impact.59 One spectacular example is the military synergy created by the introduction of horse riding from the steppes into agrarian civilizations, a process that revolutionized warfare. On the other hand, we will see that interregional exchanges could also retard processes of accumulation in the era of agrarian civilizations, mainly through their indirect impact on disease patterns; and at the same time, interregional contacts were often stifled by the greed of excessively predatory states. So commerce, too, could stimulate change, but not as powerfully as it does in the modern world.

Most tributary elites disdained the noncoercive exchanges of commerce and those who engaged in them. Their disdain is apparent in the official values of most imperial systems: in the Confucian system of values, in the Indian caste system, in Roman attitudes toward merchants, and, in general, in the low status accorded to merchants in most agrarian states. Nevertheless, in the very long run, systems of exchange expanded throughout the era of agrarian civilization; as they did, so did the volume of wealth handled by merchants and entrepreneurs, and so, eventually, did the influence of these groups.

As networks of exchange reached further, and long-distance exchanges became more frequent, hub regions gained increasing strategic importance as more information and wealth flowed through them. Because cities depend so much on commerce, urbanization provides a good indirect measure of these trends. The history of urbanization in Eurasia matches patterns we have already observed (see table 10.6). Here, too, a critical threshold seems to have been crossed in the first millennium BCE.60 In the third millennium BCE, there were perhaps eight cities with at least 30,000 inhabitants. All were in the Afro-Eurasian hub region of Mesopotamia or Egypt, and their combined population was about 240,000. By 1200 BCE, there may have been sixteen cities of this size, with a combined population of half a million, but these were now scattered throughout the eastern Mediterranean, northern India, and China. In 650 BCE, there were still only twenty cities this size, with a combined population still under a million. But by 430 BCE their numbers exceeded fifty, by 100 CE over seventy, and their total populations were, respectively, 2.9 million and 5.2 million. The demographic downturn of the first millennium CE meant that this was the high-water mark for urbanization before the second millennium. In 1000 CE, there were no more people and no more towns than in 1 CE.

TABLE 10.6. LONG-TERM TRENDS IN URBANIZATION IN AFRO-EURASIA





Directly or indirectly, urbanization and state activity encouraged trade at all ranges in the era of agrarian civilizations. The earliest governments in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China took an active part in organizing and managing exchanges both in essential and in luxury goods. By the middle of the third millennium, governments and temples traded extensively, used gold and silver to keep accounts, and even acted sometimes as lenders (at interest) or bankers. In general, market exchanges flourished where tributary methods didn’t work effectively.61 Thus, states had to trade where highly valued or strategic goods were beyond the reach of their armies. In those cases, William McNeill points out, “Rulers and men of power had to learn to deal with possessors of such commodities more or less as equals, substituting the manners and methods of diplomacy for those of command.”62 But military expansion, for all its brutality, could also provide a particularly powerful stimulus for commercial and intellectual exchanges. For example, the conquests of the Achaemenid and Hellenistic dynasties encouraged commercial and intellectual exchanges reaching from central Asia to India to the western Mediterranean. In the East, the expansion under the Han and Tang dynasties had similar catalytic impacts within China. The intellectual residue left by these exchanges shaped the cultural traditions of the Persian, Indian, Chinese, and Mediterranean worlds.63

In local trade networks, too small to interest tributary overlords, peddlers or market traders or peasants were usually better than government bureaucracies at dealing with petty exchanges. Thus competitive markets existed even in the earliest agrarian civilizations. And so did merchants, even though, in the earliest states, they often operated in close association with governments and had something of the position and status of high government officials.64 By the early second millennium BCE, records from cities such as Ebla and Mari show the existence of independent trading firms in Mesopotamia, though their trade was probably supervised or licensed by governments.65

By the second millennium, commerce was vigorous enough in some regions to provide a more important economic basis for small city-states than did tribute-taking. An early example of this kind of state may have been Ebla in northern Syria, which flourished in the era of Sargon. Ebla’s remarkable cuneiform texts, which contain detailed accounts of trade and of state involvement in trade, were found only in 1974. The records of the trading city-state of Kanesh (modern Kül-tepe) in central Anatolia also offer detailed evidence on markets, prices, and credit systems early in the second millennium BCE.66 A more familiar example from the first half of the second millennium is the Minoan state, based on the island of Crete, which dominated trade networks linking agrarian regions throughout the Mediterranean. In central Asia, a flourishing system of trading cities emerged early in the second millennium BCE in the so-called Oxus civilization. Later examples of such trade-based polities include the Mycenaean Greeks who inherited Minoan trade networks from ca. 1400 BCE; the Phoenician cities, such as Tyre and Sidon in modern Lebanon; and Greeks of the archaic period, early in the first millennium. They also include the many trading city-states of East Africa, the coast of India, and Southeast Asia. The trading city-states of the Mediterranean world established networks of colonies, the Greeks mainly along the northern shores of the inland sea and the Phoenicians mainly along the southern shores. The most important of the Phoenician colonies was Carthage (in modern-day Tunisia), founded by Tyre in 814 BCE.

Afro-Eurasian trade networks expanded rapidly after 1000 BCE. In western Eurasia, commodities such as silver had functioned loosely as forms of money since the third millennium, while in China, cowrie shells and cloth had played a similar role from at least the middle of the second millennium.67 But proper coinage, with its value stamped on it, first appeared in the middle of the first millennium BCE. Coins were circulating in Anatolia in the seventh century, and in northern China perhaps equally early; by the fourth century BCE, coins were in use in all the major regions of agrarian civilization in Eurasia. This innovation greatly simplified commercial exchanges. Equally decisive was the appearance, also from the middle of the first millennium, of vigorous commercial exchanges between eastern, southern, and western Eurasia, both by land and by sea.68 Initially, states played a vital role in stimulating trade along these routes and in protecting their own merchants. Such action is particularly clear in the case of Han China, whose government expanded toward central Asia, at great expense, under the emperor Han Wudi late in the second century BCE. However, the actual task of carrying goods was normally left to merchants, who transferred goods—often with the help and protection of pastoral nomads, or local naval powers—in relays from one end of Afro-Eurasia to the other.

As any elementary economics textbook will explain, commerce, conducted in competitive markets by actors free to profit from their transactions, can provide a powerful stimulus to innovation. In a competitive environment, where naked coercion is ruled out, cost cutting is often the most effective way of competing with rivals; thus merchants generally have good reasons to keep prices low by operating at maximum efficiency. And they often have the knowledge to lower prices, because their wide contacts can alert them to new and more efficient ways of doing things. It follows from these general rules that commercial activity is most likely to stimulate cost-cutting innovation and raise productivity levels in those areas where markets really are competitive and where commercial activity is relatively free from the control of tributary elites, who were often more interested in taking than in generating wealth.

Within agrarian civilizations, two types of regions stand out in this respect. In peripheral regions or regions of agrarian civilization where fiscal pressure was lightest, peasants stood to benefit from productivity-raising innovations because they could often keep the surpluses they generated. In the “barbarian” lands of northern Europe in the classical era, rural producers had greater independence than within the Roman Empire and often found it worthwhile to experiment. Indeed, many new techniques appeared first within these communities. For example, Roman writers credited the Celts with “the invention of enameling, the spoked wheel, soap, improved agricultural implements, and advanced ironworking techniques.”69 In eastern Europe, the introduction of rye allowed the eventual settlement of the lands between eastern Europe and the Urals, which were poorly suited to the traditional crops of the Mediterranean or western Europe. Communities of farmers, such as the Goths, sometimes found it profitable to engage in a combination of pillage and trade, particularly along the borders of a decaying Roman empire. But even peasants within agrarian states were likely to take more interest in raising productivity when they had secure access to land and were not taxed too heavily. The surprisingly high yields of peasant farming in China in the centuries before the modern era almost certainly had something to do with the fact that tax levels were usually modest (because Chinese governments did not usually spend as much on warfare as did contemporary European states) and that the proportion of peasants who owned their land was high.70

The second area in which the productivity-raising potential of commerce tended to increase consisted of regions of small tributary states near the hubs of regional trade systems. Because they were small, such states had access to limited tributary revenues. But if the states were situated near imperial systems with flourishing networks of trade, their rulers could collaborate with local merchants to secure additional revenues from commerce. In such regions, markets were more likely to be genuinely competitive, because smaller states had less opportunities than the great tributary juggernauts to support themselves purely from tributary revenues. Indeed, in the era of agrarian civilizations, the real dynamos of innovation were often regions of petty states or city-states lying near the hubs of regional networks of exchange. If, in addition, such states existed in regions of intense interstate rivalry, the pressures to seek a mixture of commercial and tributary revenues were particularly strong. And those that succeeded commercially sometimes managed to tap into huge flows of wealth and information. By doing so, small states, such as classical Athens or early modern Genoa or Venice, sometimes became major powers despite their limited internal resources.

As Anthony Giddens has pointed out, in the era of agrarian civilizations, small, commercialized states often appeared not as isolated entities but in entire systems, which were usually highly competitive, and within which merchants generally had higher status than in larger tributary polities.71 Such regions were particularly likely to pioneer innovations, especially in commercial methods, in transportation, and in warfare. It is no wonder that the earliest alphabetical scripts are Phoenician, or that modern mathematics and the classical military phalanx owe so much to the Greek city-states, or that the trading cities of Islamic central Asia did so much to preserve the technical and scientific knowledge of the classical world, or that modern commercial techniques are so indebted to the city-states of Renaissance Italy.72

Urbanization and commercialization encouraged accumulation of many different kinds: accumulation of wealth, of ideas, of new technologies and methods of doing things. But increasing commercial activity, like the state, could also undercut growth, and it did so primarily by affecting patterns of disease. Most precapitalist cities were unhealthy places to live in; their filth and congestion provided such benign environments for disease bacteria that city dwellers normally had lower life expectancies than village dwellers. Until the twentieth century, cities were the social equivalent of galactic black holes, sucking in and destroying surplus populations from their hinterlands. Thus urbanization itself dampened population growth, and it did so most decisively when cities grew fastest. As we have seen, expanding trade networks could have a similar effect, but on a much larger scale, by encouraging the exchange of diseases. For this reason, we cannot take the spread of cities and of trade as unambiguous measures of growth, though they are often indicators of increasing innovation.

Finally, the chances of commercial activity stimulating innovation were stifled throughout the era of agrarian civilizations by the fiscal methods of powerful tributary states. Though tributary states normally tolerated and sometimes encouraged commerce, their predatory methods and willingness to resort to force were ever-present threats to the freedoms needed for trade to flourish. There was therefore a fundamental long-term conflict between the methods of tribute takers and those of merchants; and as long as tributary elites dominated political systems, this conflict limited the productivity-raising potential of commercial activity.





Rates of Innovation




We have seen that population growth, increasing state power, and increasing commercialization all stimulated innovations and growth in the era of agrarian civilizations. But each of these factors could also inhibit accumulation. This contradictory pattern may help explain some important general features of the era of agrarian civilizations. First, despite the existence of new sources of innovation, long-term rates of population growth were not strikingly different from those of the early agrarian era. The negative impact of overpredatory tributary states and of new disease patterns counterbalanced the more positive influences of population growth, increasing state power, and commercial expansion. Second, throughout this era the rate of innovation was sluggish. There were innovations in many areas, of course, from bureaucratic management, to literacy, to warfare, to communications and metallurgy. Furthermore, increasing commerce ensured that technologies such as bronze- or ironworking or horse riding or chariot warfare would spread widely throughout Afro-Eurasia. Nevertheless, what is striking over the entire 4,000 years is how limited innovations were, particularly in productive technologies—in methods of farming and manufacturing. Finally, it is precisely this pattern of sluggish growth that explains the basic Malthusian rhythm of rise and fall that appears to have been characteristic of all agrarian civilizations. On the whole, in this era of human history, fundamentally new technologies contributed less to accumulation than did the gradual spread of small improvements to already-existing technologies, such as those of the secondary products revolution, which had been pioneered during the early agrarian era.





SUMMARY




Agrarian civilizations have dominated the stories told in modern historiography. From the moment of their appearance, about 5,000 years ago, they slowly expanded and became more powerful. Though they were never alone—they shared the world with many other types of communities not organized in states—they eventually became the most populous and most powerful social organizations in the world. Their power grew as new states appeared, as managerial techniques improved, and as the area controlled by states increased. Their size, together with the extent and vigor of exchanges within and between agrarian civilizations, ensured that innovation continued throughout this period. The main motors of innovation were population growth, state activity, and increasing commercial activity and urbanization. But each of these mechanisms could also slow innovation. As regional populations came into contact with each other, they swapped diseases in exchanges that sometimes led to catastrophic epidemics that undermined state power and led to regional declines. Tribute-taking states depended primarily on the coercive extraction of resources, and they were often ambivalent or hostile in their treatment of entrepreneurial activity. Yet entrepreneurial activity was itself one of the most important motors of innovation. Cities, too, were vital clearinghouses for informational and commercial exchanges, but their unhealthy environments slowed population growth and spread disease. In all these ways, the activities of agrarian civilizations stimulated but also slowed innovation. These contradictory influences had a contradictory outcome: though the history of the era of agrarian civilizations is characterized by innovations of many kinds, nowhere was innovation sufficient to keep up with the pace of population growth. And this is why the rhythms of historical change in this period were dominated by Malthusian cycles—long periods of demographic, commercial, and economic growth followed by periods of decline before growth began once again.





FURTHER READING




The era of agrarian civilizations has been the subject of a vast amount of scholarship, but surprisingly little of that scholarship has focused on the large trends. Works that do, include the remarkable articles of Rein Taagepera and the collections within the world systems tradition by Stephen K. Sanderson, Andre Gunder Frank and Barry Gills, and Christopher Chase-Dunn and Thomas Hall listed in the bibliography. They also include the many fine texts on world history available today, many of which focus on the period from ca. 3000 BCE to 1500 CE. Some of the best are Jerry Bentley and Herbert Ziegler, Traditions and Encounters (2 vols.; 2nd ed., 2003); Richard Bulliet et al., The Earth and Its Peoples (1997); and Howard Spodek, The World’s History(2nd ed., 2001). There are also good surveys in William McNeill’s classic study, The Rise of the West (1963), and in volumes 3 and 4 of the series of histories edited by Göran Burenhult, The Illustrated History of Humankind (1994). Michael Mann’s The Sources of Social Power (1986) surveys the history of state power, while Tertius Chandler’s Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth (1987) surveys urbanization. Finally, historical sociologists, such as Anthony Giddens (see especially A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism [2nd ed., 1995] and its second volume, The Nation-State and Violence [1985]), and Michael Mann, have taken up some of the themes discussed in this chapter.
