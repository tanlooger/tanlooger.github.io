CITIES, STATES, AND “CIVILIZATIONS”





SOCIAL COMPLEXITY




In the early universe, gravity took hold of clouds of atoms, and sculpted them into stars and galaxies. In the era described in this chapter, we will see how, by a sort of social gravity, cities and states were sculpted from scattered communities of farmers. As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field.

The urbanized, state-organized, and often warring communities that were the products of these changes have been the main focus of modern historiography. So it has been all too easy for historians to forget how different these communities were from the small-scale and relatively nonhierarchical societies of the Paleolithic and the early agrarian eras. In fact, most of human history (chronologically speaking) has taken place in communities quite innocent of state power. Even in the villages of the early agrarian era, for most people, most of the time, the important relationships were personal, local, and fairly egalitarian. Most households were self-sufficient, and people dealt with each other as people rather than as the representatives of institutions.

Then, about 5,000 years ago, the first states appeared. Small city-states existed in southern Mesopotamia by ca. 3200 BCE (see map 9.1). By 3100 BCE a state had appeared in Egypt, where a regional official (named Menes or Narmer) united north and south into a single kingdom and founded the first Egyptian dynasty. States also appeared in other regions of rising population density—in northern India and China by ca. 2000 BCE, and in Mesoamerica by 1000 BCE (see map 9.2). The appearance of the first states marks a critical transition from personal relations to impersonal power, and from power over things to power over people.1 The world of hierarchy, power, and states is the one we know today. It is a world in which the wealth and power of individuals and communities can vary tremendously, according to their birth, their gender, and the ethnic group to which they belong. Marvin Harris describes the change as the end of equality.

For the first time there appeared on earth kings, dictators, high priests, emperors, prime ministers, presidents, governors, mayors, generals, admirals, police chiefs, judges, lawyers, and jailers, along with dungeons, jails, penitentiaries, and concentration camps. Under the tutelage of the state, human beings learned for the first time how to bow, grovel, kneel, and kowtow. In many ways the rise of the state was the descent of the world from freedom to slavery.2





States were normally embedded within larger regions that included other states and their hinterlands. I will describe such regions as agrarian civilizations. Civilization is often taken as a synonym for progress, but that is not the sense in which the word is used here. Though there are clear differences between agrarian civilizations and other types of human community, I make no judgments about the intrinsic worth of any particular type of society. I define agrarian civilizations as large societies based on agriculture, with states and all that that implies (literacy, warfare, etc.). The term agrarian civilization may seem self-contradictory, for we associate civilization (a term derived from civis, the Latin word meaning “citizen”) with states and particularly their cities. But the adjective agrarian reminds us that all premodern cities depended on rural hinterlands at the city’s edge or in more distant villages.

It will help to think of the emergence of cities and states, like the evolution of multicellular organisms, as a process that linked once independent entities into larger unities. Figure 9.1 offers a simplified way of thinking about some of the main stages in this process (and see table 9.1).3 The transition discussed in this chapter can be thought of as a shift from level 4 to level 5, while agrarian civilizations in general are normally organized at levels 5 and 6.

How can we explain this fundamental transition? Increasing population density in farming regions provided the demographic and physical raw materials used to construct the first cities and states, and increasing congestion provided much of the motivation for creating states.4 But did local communities willingly join together, or were they pushed together? The answer is probably a bit of both.

“Top-down” theories highlight the element of coercion, seeing states as institutions imposed on majorities by privileged and powerful minorities. This approach is common in Marxist theories of the state, which view states primarily as mechanisms for exploitation. While some individuals (mainly farmers) continued to extract resources from the natural world, as their ancestors had done before them, a new layer of rulers now appeared; they began to extract resources from their fellow humans by manipulating large networks of influence, wealth, and power. Human society became the “niche” in which elites foraged for the resources they needed. Society became multilayered, with a base level of those who exploited nature (the primary producers) and upper layers of those who exploited those who exploited nature. These changes created a new “food chain” within human society, and the emerging division of interests between elites and those they exploited is undoubtedly part of the explanation for the emergence of complex social structures.





Figure 9.1. Scales of social organization. A highly schematic attempt to capture the significant differences in scale of human social organization.



But exploitation, like symbiosis, is never simple or unambiguous. Like predation in the nonhuman world, it can take more or less brutal forms. Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan observe, “In the long run, the most vicious predators, like the most dread disease-causing microbes, bring about their own ruin by killing their victims. Restrained predation—the attack that doesn’t quite kill or does kill only slowly—is a recurring theme in evolution.”5 Within relationships of restrained predation, both partners may gain something, and exploitation may be softened by shared interests. In early states, including those of Mesopotamia, China, and Mesoamerica, exploitation could take extraordinarily brutal forms, including large-scale human sacrifices. But just as disease viruses often evolve less virulent strains that can exploit their prey without killing them, so human rulers eventually learned to protect the farmers they exploited (much as farmers protected their own herds of livestock). In this way, primary producers could become as dependent on the elites that ruled them as the elites were on primary producers. William McNeill has described these new relationships as a form of parasitism: “Disease germs are the most important microparasites humans have to deal with. Our only significant macroparasites are other men who, by specializing in violence, are able to secure a living without themselves producing the food and other commodities they consume.”6 Both elites and those they exploited had to adapt to the new, multilayered “ecology” that was emerging within human society, for the new structures transformed the intimate, ancient structures of village, household, and family.

“Bottom-up” theories of state formation stress that as societies become more complex, people find that they need state-like structures to survive. This process provides some striking analogies with the nonhuman world. Transitions to greater social complexity have occurred in the histories of many species, though not, apparently, among our closest relatives, the great apes. We have seen how single cells combined, first in loose structures such as stromatolites or sponges and eventually within multicelled organisms such as ourselves, in which there is a division of labor between different cells, each depending on the smooth functioning of the entire community. Multicelled organisms can also combine into larger communities. Some, like herds of antelope, are large but simple; others can be very complicated. Many species of social insects, such as ants, termites, and bees, live in dense communities, whose members are utterly dependent on the larger whole. Their environment (as in modern cities) consists mainly of other members of their own species and the structures they create. In the most complex communities, such as termite mounds, individuals become rigidly specialized, and special forms of communication and coordination are required if the community is to function effectively. Individuals communicate by sight, by touch, and by exchanging chemicals known as pheromones. Special routines evolve to deal with congestion, pollution, and conflicts between individuals. And hierarchies appear.

To us, these communities can look surprisingly like states, with their own caste systems and with their own methods of controlling and disciplining individuals. This is why human researchers find it so natural to talk of “queen bees” or “worker ants.” As Lewis Thomas has written, ants “are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies for wars, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse their enemies, capture slaves. The families of weaver ants engage in child labor, holding their larvae like shuttles to spin out the threads that sew the leaves together for their fungus gardens. They exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watch television.”7 The parallels are indeed eerie, and they lend credibility to bottom-up theories of state formation. These see states as the solutions to problems experienced by all members of dense, congested communities. Humans also found that as they lived in larger and more complicated communities, they had to divide up tasks and knowledge; this development required new forms of communication, such as calendars to help people schedule their activities, or writing to help track the obligations and possessions of individuals. Individuals became more dependent on the group as a whole, and the group had to be organized in new ways as individuals swapped skills and resources. Yet as they began to coordinate the energies and skills of millions of individuals, these larger communities acquired an ecological power that no individual could match, though all stood to benefit from it in varying degrees. So the logic of state formation among humans parallels similar processes among the social insects. The major difference, just as we saw when examining the appearance of agriculture, is that humans adapted culturally while insects evolved genetically. This explains why the transition to social complexity could occur so much faster among humans.

Any attempt to explain state power will have to combine top-down and bottom-up theories, for they are in fact complementary. The rest of this chapter will attempt a systematic explanation of the emergence of state power, by which I mean the concentration, in the hands of a few people, of substantial control over considerable human and material resources. This formulation leaves plenty of room for argument (over the word substantial for example), but it helps focus attention on two crucial preconditions for large power structures. The first is the appearance of large accumulations of human, material, and intellectual resources; the second is the appearance of new ways of managing and controlling these resources.





INTENSIFICATION: NEW WAYS OF EXTRACTING RESOURCES FROM THE NATURAL WORLD




Shifting to new levels of complexity meant tapping and managing new energy sources. The new energy sources were generated by more intensive technologies (the theme of the first half of this chapter). Constructing social structures that could manage these huge energy flows without breaking down was a complex task that eventually generated the coordinating mechanisms we know as states (the theme of the second half of this chapter).

Transitions to new levels of complexity often depend on positive feedback mechanisms—cycles in which one change encourages another, which stimulates a third, which magnifies the first, and so on around the circle. One of these causal chains played a fundamental role in the transition to larger and more complex social structures. It links population growth, collective learning, and technological innovation (see figure 9.2). Increasing the size and density of human communities stimulated processes of collective learning by increasing the size and variety of the networks within which information and goods could be exchanged. The intellectual synergies possible within these larger networks encouraged the development of new and more intensive technologies, which made it possible to support even larger human communities.8 This feedback loop accelerated rates of innovation and growth, an outcome that helps explain why the emergence of agriculture counts as such a significant shifting of gears in human history. The pace of change may seem slow by modern standards, but it was fast by the standards of the Paleolithic era—and dazzling in comparison with the pace of genetic change in the nonhuman world.





Figure 9.2. Agriculture and population growth: a positive feedback loop.



In the millennia after the appearance of agriculture, there emerged within the Afro-Eurasian and American world zones several new technologies whose cumulative effect was to raise the productivity of technologies based on domestication. Here I will describe three of the more important changes, roughly in order of increasing intensification: shifting cultivation, the “secondary products revolution,” and irrigation. Table 9.2 gives a general idea of the profound impact of different levels of intensity on food production per hectare and on population densities, in different eras of human history.

TABLE 9.2. ENERGY INPUT AND POPULATION DENSITY OVER TIME





Shifting Cultivation




Shifting or swidden cultivation is a seminomadic form of agriculture, still widely practiced today (mainly in forested environments). Indeed, it was swidden cultivation that enabled early agriculturalists to move beyond the easily worked soils preferred by the earliest farmers into forested environments, such as those of northern Eurasia. Because it normally uses fire to clear new areas for cultivation, swidden agriculture can be thought of as an adaptation of Paleolithic techniques of fire stick farming to the new technologies of the agricultural era.9 It is a way of exploiting the nutrients stored in trees. Swidden farmers often clear an area of forest by felling or girdling the trees; they then burn the felled trees and grow crops between the remaining tree stumps in the highly fertile ash left behind. In Europe, early Neolithic cultivators grew cereals in clearings made with stone axes.10 In newly created clearings, crops are not only nourished by the ash of felled trees but also freed from competition with other plants, so they grow exuberantly But after three or four years, the soil’s fertility is usually exhausted and it is necessary to move on. Where populations are small, entire communities can move in cycles of 20 to 50 years, which may be long enough to allow each patch of forest to regenerate between cycles. But as populations grow, the cycles inevitably shorten and the clearings become more permanent, a process that eventually created the forest-free agrarian landscapes more familiar in the modern world. In this way, shifting cultivation eventually led to massive deforestation. Overall, since the early Holocene, forests have declined by ca. 20 percent, from about 5 billion to 4 billion hectares. Until recently, the decline was more marked in temperate forests (32–35 percent) than in tropical forests (4–6 percent), but today, deforestation is most rapid in regions of tropical forest.11





The “Secondary Products Revolution”




Shifting cultivation has been practiced in varying degrees, in all the world zones. But the second major form of intensification occurred only in the Afro-Eurasian zone, because it depended on new ways of exploiting domestic livestock—and megafaunal extinctions in the Americas and Australia had left those zones hardly any potential domesticates to exploit.

As farmers entered the temperate zones of eastern and central Europe, they had to adapt their farming methods to colder and wetter climates. Andrew Sherratt has argued that between about 5000 and 3000 BCE, there occurred several important changes in farming methods that helped solve some of these problems.12 He lumps these changes together under the label of the “secondary products revolution.” The new techniques created a closer symbiosis with domestic livestock, and thus enabled humans to exploit their livestock more efficiently.

In the early agrarian era, domesticated animals were used mainly as sources of stored meat and hides. Though they had to be fed throughout their lifetime, they were used only once, when they were slaughtered. This inefficient method of exploitation may explain why animal domesticates were less important than plants in most early agrarian era communities. However, from ca. 5000 to 4000 BCE, farming communities in parts of Afro-Eurasia learned how to make good use of their animals even when they were alive by exploiting their secondary products—in particular, their milk and their wool. The farmers also learned to use animals as a new source of energy, particularly of traction power. Large animals such as horses, camels, or oxen soon became the most powerful sources of widely available mechanical energy. This was a revolutionary change, perhaps as dramatic in its way as the more recent fossil fuels revolution, for it provided the most significant new form of power since humans had first learned to make effective use of fire. Draft animals can deliver 500 to 700 watts of power, while humans, at best, can deliver about 75 watts.13 The traction power of cattle or horses was used to carry people, as well as to pull carts and plows.

Horse- or ox-drawn plows were particularly important; because they could turn over soils more effectively than digging sticks, they could work tougher soils. Greater use of livestock also increased the amounts of dung available to maintain soil fertility. More efficient exploitation of livestock increased the productivity of farmers, while the increasing availability of dung as fertilizer and of plows to turn over the soil made it possible to farm less productive soils. Thus the new techniques enabled agriculture to spread into regions of heavier, clayey soils, such as those of northern Europe.

These changes also made it possible for the first time to settle arid steppe-lands, for they allowed some groups to live almost entirely off the produce of their livestock. The secondary products revolution turned domesticated herbivores into efficient machines for transforming grass into energy usable by humans, just as, much later, the Industrial Revolution would find transformative new ways of extracting energy from coal. Pastoralists exploited the new technologies by settling the huge areas of African and Eurasian grassland that had been too arid to farm. Because the most effective way of exploiting grasslands was to let herds graze over large areas, pastoralists often had to live a nomadic or seminomadic existence. So we often think of pastoralism as intrinsically nomadic, though in fact it need not be. Early forms of pastoralism probably appeared in the steppelands of southeastern Russia and western Kazakhstan about 4000 BCE, but the militaristic and highly nomadic horse-riding pastoralism of later millennia developed fully only in the first millennium BCE, after the development of new and improved forms of saddles. Pastoralism also evolved in Southwest Asia and in East Africa.

The secondary products revolution was a form of extensification, insofar as it enabled human communities to settle regions that had previously been almost uninhabitable. But it also counts as a form of intensification, because it allowed denser settlement, and because the use of animal traction improved transportation networks throughout Eurasia. In the long run, this revolution transformed communications, commerce, and warfare in the Afro-Eurasian zone, making it possible to move goods and soldiers more easily and rapidly over larger distances, whether in carts or chariots (from ca. 2000 BCE) or on horseback. In Eurasia, pastoralists provided the links that drew the agrarian civilizations of China, India, and Mesopotamia into a single, trans-Eurasian network of exchanges. This ensured that technologies, religions, even disease immunities could be shared throughout the region. All in all, the technologies of the secondary products revolution guaranteed that the Afro-Eurasian zone would become the largest area of shared knowledge on earth.14

It has been argued that the secondary products revolution, particularly the development of plow agriculture, may also have played a significant role in the evolution of more hierarchical gender relations. In horticultural societies, as we have seen, women normally carry out most agricultural work. Yet in societies that farm with plows, the agricultural work is normally done by men. And it has been suggested that the male “takeover” of farming was an important step toward the emergence of less egalitarian gender relations. According to Margaret Ehrenberg, “Anthropologists have shown that in present-day societies a significant … correlation exists between plough agriculture and patrilineal descent and land ownership in the same way as there is a correlation between non-plough agriculture and the heavy involvement, and consequent enhanced status, of women.”15 Yet there are difficulties with this theory. One is that even if men spent more time on agricultural tasks in societies using plow agriculture, the role of women in productive and reproductive activities remained as fundamental as ever. Another is that many communities never transformed by the secondary products revolution, such as farming societies in the Americas, also developed strikingly patriarchal structures. So we should not link patriarchy too closely to the appearance of any one lifeway or technology. As I will argue later, institutionalized patriarchy probably arose alongside institutionalized hierarchies in general; it evolved hand in hand with (and overlapped with) slavery, class, tribute exaction, and the state.





Irrigation




Like shifting cultivation, irrigation of some kind was practiced in all world zones, though it had its greatest impact in Afro-Eurasia and, to a lesser extent, in the Americas. In many warmer lands, there is plenty of sunlight available for photosynthesis, but plant growth is limited by lack of rainfall. Irrigation is a way of making the water of rivers or swamps available for crop cultivation. It has been one of the most important of all forms of agricultural intensification and remains vital today, whether in suburban gardens or the great grain factories of the American Midwest. Early forms of irrigation were often extremely simple, involving little more than the deliberate diversion of stream water into fields of crops by digging small channels. In areas of abundant water, such as the Euphrates Delta in southern Mesopotamia, irrigation was often just a matter of diverting small portions of the flow from the many small rivers that flowed into the Euphrates. Given such techniques, farmers benefited from the region’s rich alluvial soils, which were laid down by the two great rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Eventually, though, as farming communities grew and as new forms of organization appeared, irrigation works became more elaborate; large, carefully planned networks of canals were built, using the labor of thousands of people. In arid lands with fertile soils, such as the flatlands of Mesopotamia or the lands along the Yellow River in China, irrigation could raise agricultural productivity decisively, which is why irrigation has been one of the most revolutionary of all technological innovations.

Irrigation was also used in many other areas. In Papua New Guinea there is evidence of irrigation as early as 9,000 years ago. In southern China and other parts of Southeast Asia, rice farmers developed many techniques of terracing and irrigation to increase the productivity of their main crop. In Mesoamerica, too, sophisticated new forms of irrigation evolved later in the agrarian era. In the first millennium CE, Mayans drained and filled swamps with town refuse, so as to form productive and easily worked soils that could support rapid population growth. Improved strains of maize also raised productivity in Mesoamerica. However, there was no secondary products revolution, because of the absence of suitable large domesticates. This had a profound impact on American agriculture, and it may explain many differences in the historical trajectories of the Americas and Afro-Eurasia.16





Other Innovations




Many other innovations also appeared in agrarian regions—in textile making, pottery making, building, and metallurgy, to name a few areas. The earliest pottery may be from the Jomon culture in Japan and may date back to the beginning of the Holocene era. In Mesopotamia, the earliest evidence of pottery comes from about 6500 BCE. It was used for carrying liquids and for cooking as well as for storage of foodstuffs. Pottery was also made in South and Central America from perhaps as early as 3000 BCE. In both the Afro-Eurasian and American world zones, pottery making was a natural development for peoples who built homes from mud and cooked their food in ovens or over fires. Soft metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, were worked in many parts of the world during the early agrarian era, but they were used mainly for ornamentation. The earliest evidence of such metalwork in Mesopotamia comes from ca. 5500 BCE; the same metals were also worked later in the Americas. But the working of hard metals, which could be used for weapons or tools, was a later development, because their manufacture required higher temperatures and more efficient ovens. Hard metals were made from alloys, such as bronze (made from copper and tin or sometimes arsenic) or iron (which is hardest if combined with some carbon). They were only ever made in Afro-Eurasia. That they appeared nowhere else is surprising, for the skills needed to work hard metals were similar to those needed to fire pottery. Bronze was first worked in Sumer in the fourth millennium BCE, and by 2000 BCE bronze was also being worked in China. Hard irons were first produced perhaps in the Caucasus in the middle of the second millennium BCE, and spread throughout many regions of Afro-Eurasia in the first millennium BCE; for this reason, the first millennium is often called the Iron Age. The first true steels were probably produced in the Roman Empire.





Population Growth




More productive agrarian technologies encouraged population growth. But population growth itself counts as a form of intensification, for in the era before fossil fuels, the energy resources available to human societies came mostly from human or animal muscle power. More people and more cattle thus meant that more productive power was available, wherever social structures were efficient enough to control and coordinate the activities of large numbers of people and livestock.17

In the Fertile Crescent, where these processes have been studied most closely, the long-term spread of village communities can be traced in the increasing number of sites. After ca. 5000 BCE, villages spread from the Fertile Crescent down into the flat desert lands and the marshlands along the great rivers of the Mesopotamian plain. In the arid plains, farmers had to make more use of river water, through simple forms of irrigation. They could also exploit the large number of fish in the great rivers. As farming communities multiplied, spread, diversified their techniques, and improved their productivity, both the resources they produced and the populations they supported increased. As we have seen, world populations grew from perhaps 6 million to 50 million in the period between 10,000 and 5,000 years ago.

On the largest scale, the trend of accumulation is clear. But it is important to remember that on the scale of decades or centuries, accumulation was a chaotic and erratic process. Population densities might increase in one region, and then decline as a result of climatic change, overworking of the soils, or some other cause. As Robert Wenke puts it: “The whole history of early complexity, in fact, seems to be a messy ‘boom-or-bust’ cycle, with only a very general long-term over-all trend toward complexity.”18





HIERARCHY: EMERGING INEQUALITIES IN WEALTH AND POWER




More productive technologies and larger, denser communities created the preconditions for the emergence of states.





Evidence of Emerging Inequality




As available resources increased, societies had to face, for the first time, the task of dealing with surpluses, whose control and distribution posed entirely novel problems. And, surprisingly quickly, their distribution became lopsided, so that gradients of power and wealth appeared. Surpluses began to sustain populations of privileged (and mainly male) specialists: artisans, traders, warriors, priests, scribes, and rulers.

It is worth noting how paradoxical this steepening of hierarchies is. For the increases in productivity associated with the agrarian revolution might, in principle, have raised the average material living standards of all members of society. The reality was different. Unlike water, which prefers to lie flat as it accumulates, material wealth in complex societies likes to pile itself up into huge pyramids. Offering some explanation for this curious but fundamental feature of complex societies will be one of the central tasks of this chapter. But the general principle can be stated straightaway. As populations became denser, people, like termites, found that they needed ways of organizing and coordinating their activities. But this meant conceding power to organizers who used that power in ways that benefited themselves as much as (and often more than) the communities they controlled. Inequality is what all top-down theories of state formation predict.

Archaeologists have many ways of tracking inequality. Even in the most sophisticated early agrarian era communities—such as the Anatolian town of Çatal Hüyük, which flourished from ca. 6250 to 5400 BCE, traded in obsidian over wide areas, and had a population of perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 people—there is little sign of significant differences in wealth. However, there are minor differences in the ways people are buried, and archaeologists argue that such differentiation shows one of the earliest responses to increasing population densities: the emergence of ranked clans. As communities increase in size, kinship thinking and the social mechanisms based on it are stretched to their limits. It is impossible to think of a community of 4,000 people as a single family. But it is possible to retain a loose sense of kinship by assuming that all members of a community share a common ancestor. (Whether the ancestor is mythical or real is unimportant.) Once this happens, the symbolic logic of kinship dictates that different lineages will trace their descent to different children of the ancestor, some to senior children and some to junior children. And in this way, whole lineages may be thought of as senior and junior, just as individuals within a family may be ranked by seniority. Ranked lineages arise naturally out of the ideology of kinship, for even in the most egalitarian kin-ordered communities, people were often ranked within families by age and seniority. So, kinship thinking naturally predisposed people to accept the authority of senior members of senior clans.

Archaeologists know there is inequality when houses vary in size and in the value of the objects they contain. Special objects or types of clothing can also hint at high status. Welfare and nutritional levels can also tell us much about hierarchies, for elite groups were almost invariably better fed than those they ruled. So bioarchaeologists often find differences in the height of members of different social groups. John Coatsworth writes: “Among ancient Mesoamericans, ruling elites of nobles, priests, and warriors controlled access to food, particularly scarce sources of protein In England in 1800 … the adult male members of the titled nobility stood a full five inches taller than the population as a whole.”19

Equally suggestive is the appearance of monumental architecture. Some large structures, such as Stonehenge, have no obvious utilitarian functions. They may have been used as ritual centers, and perhaps as astronomical observatories. Others, such as the ziggurats and pyramids of Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Mesoamerica, often contain burials, or perhaps palaces or temples, all of which indicate the presence of high-status individuals. Such structures have appeared in all societies in which states have later emerged, and in many that did not develop state structures. The most spectacular are undoubtedly the Egyptian pyramids, the first of which were built in the middle of the third millennium BCE. The appearance of such structures suggests that religious thinking was changing, too, as human communities became larger and more complex. Just as ranked hierarchies appeared among humans, so there began to appear elite gods, who required an appropriate degree of respect. For, as the sociologist Émile Durkheim first suggested, our thinking about the way the universe works often mirrors the way our own societies work. The best way of showing respect for these more awesome and remote gods was to build special buildings for them, buildings closer to the sky than ordinary dwellings, where humans could pay their respects by offering sacrifices and gifts. Where monumental architecture appears, we can be certain that there exist powerful leaders or managers, for someone has to coordinate the labor of hundreds, even thousands, of people. In this way, secular and religious power often went hand in hand. Leaders hoped to inspire awe by building such structures—awe at the power of the gods, and also at the majesty of the priests and rulers who dealt directly with such powerful gods and who supervised the building of their residences. Monumental architecture is both a sign of power and an instrument of power.

In Mesopotamia, the earliest monumental structure is probably the temple of Eridu, which dates to about 5000 BCE. The ziggurats of the late fourth millennium BCE were magnificent stepped structures, built with immense amounts of labor and displaying elaborate architectural detailing. They provided an awesome setting for religious and political ceremonies. In Mesoamerica, the earliest pyramids were built by the Olmec, early in the second millennium BCE. From as early as 2000 BCE, spectacular burial mounds appeared even in less densely settled regions, including the Eurasian steppes, where there were few towns and where most people were mobile pastoralists. The huge tomb of Arzhan in Tuva, which dates from the eighth century BCE, shows how much wealth and labor powerful steppe leaders could mobilize, often by exploiting the resources of neighboring sedentary communities. The Arzhan tomb included seventy chambers arranged like the spokes of a wheel; it contained about 160 saddle horses under a mound 120 meters wide.20 At the center were buried a man and a woman, who wore furs and elaborate decorations. They clearly ruled a large and powerful tribal confederation, for subordinate princes or nobles were buried to their south, west, and north, and some may have been sacrificed as part of the burial rites. Monumental architecture of astonishing scale also appeared in one of the most remote communities of all in the era of agrarian civilizations: on Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Here, in a population of only a few thousand people, local chiefs competed with each other in the building of huge statues.

In densely settled regions, new communities began to arrange themselves in networks whose topology had less to do with natural features of the land than with the existence and distribution of other settlements. This is a familiar pattern even today in densely inhabited regions. Small villages tend to arrange themselves in roughly symmetrical patterns around larger villages that act as centers of gravity for local networks of exchange. In this way there may emerge hierarchical networks of small villages surrounding larger villages, which are grouped around small towns, which may be grouped around a major city. Even smaller towns will often contain institutions not present in the villages, such as temples, warehouses, and perhaps a priest’s or a chief’s residence. As a rule, then, the larger settlements, which act as local centers of gravity, will show greater internal differentiation than the surrounding villages. In Mesopotamia, there is clear evidence for the appearance of two-tiered systems by the period of Eridu, in the fifth millennium BCE. The large towns often have populations of 1,000 to 3,000 people, and many have ceremonial platforms of some kind as well as distinct storage areas, so they may have acted as marketplaces and religious centers.

Even more striking evidence of inequality is the appearance of large-scale conflicts or wars. The crucial markers here are fortifications and burials with weapons. In the Tripolye culture of Ukraine, which began as a typically egalitarian early agrarian era region, villages expanded after about 4000 BCE, and they appeared more often on sites that can be easily fortified. In the Eurasian steppes, warfare reflected growing conflict between sedentary communities of farmers and emerging communities of nomadic pastoralists. The rich pastoralist burials that appear from late in the third millennium show that by this time pastoralists sometimes extorted significant wealth from less well armed farming communities.

At the bottom of these emerging hierarchies were slaves and other dependents. These men and women were treated by their masters as stores of energy as living batteries, as human cattle. In mechanical terms, humans are quite efficient converters of food into energy, so human slaves were often more valuable than animal slaves, if one could afford them.21 The importance of human beings as a source of energy helps explain why forced labor was so ubiquitous in the premodern world, just as the existence of fossil fuels helps explain why human slavery has largely vanished today. Forced labor and human slavery existed in many forms in agrarian civilizations; and slaves or dependents occasionally rose to positions of power and wealth. But most were used as sources of stored energy for their owners: where human labor power was as important a source of energy as oil is today, controlling energy meant controlling people. To make slaves more amenable to control, they were often separated at birth from their families. And, like domestic animals, many were deliberately kept in a state of infantile dependence that inflicted a sort of psychic amputation on them—they remained like children, and their helplessness made them easier to control. Both animal and human slaves could be controlled best if kept economically and psychically dependent on their owners.

As emerging hierarchies also altered definitions of the social roles of men and women, hierarchies began to be ordered along lines of gender as well as of class and occupation. For the most part, elite men ended up dominating hierarchies. Why has hierarchy usually meant patriarchy ? The simplest assumption—men were less vital than women within the household, the basic cell of human society—may provide the best explanation. New forms of power emerged above the level of the household as part of an increasingly elaborate division of labor. Power brokers were specialists in power, management, information collection, combat, or religion. But specialist roles in general were more available to those whose role within the household (the most fundamental unit of all societies) was least vital.22 In societies without contraception or bottle-feeding, this meant the men (or the aristocratic women, some of whose functions could be fulfilled by other women). Thus, while weaving and spinning were regarded as one aspect of women’s work in many societies, whether the products were consumed within the family or sold at market, specialist or full-time weavers were more likely to be men. As the division of labor became more elaborate, specialized roles, whether in warfare, in religious activity, or in government, were normally (not al ways) more open to men than to women, for men usually found it easier to place themselves at the hub of local exchange networks. And in this way there emerged in many larger agrarian communities a distinction between the household world, often dominated by women, and the public domain, often dominated by men.

Patriarchy is the way the emerging gradient of wealth and power was expressed in gender relations, because many of these specialized roles gave men access to new forms of wealth and power. Increased power, in turn, gave elite men more influence over public definitions of gender roles. The fact that written histories were constructed first within an emerging public domain, and were written mainly by men, helps explain why the written sources on which so much modern historical writing depends focused on the public domain and the doings of men. And it may be that works written by men have also made patriarchy seem simpler than it was, hiding from modern researchers the complex negotiations that went on in all households and the many ways in which both women and men evaded or softened social conventions that they found constricting.





New Forms of Power and Control: Power Based on Consent




How can we explain this steepening of the gradient of wealth and power in large agrarian communities? Anthropologists have shown that in small nomadic communities, individuals will normally resist attempts by individuals to assume power over them. How did hierarchies arise despite this resistance?

Modern studies of village communities, combined with archaeological evidence, suggest some of the stages through which particular groups or individuals may have begun controlling the labor and resources of others.23 In many human communities, power and resources are surrendered willingly to trusted leaders. This we can call consent-based power, or power from below. In larger communities, however, leaders could use the increasing resources placed under their control to create new forms of power that enabled them to coerce at least some of the people they ruled. This is coercive power, or power from above.24 The distinction corresponds to the distinction made earlier in this chapter between top-down and bottom-up theories of state formation. In practice, all states rest on both types of power, and the two are always intertwined. Nevertheless, there is a clear historical and logical sequence leading from power based on consent to power based also on coercion.25

In the absence of state structures, the resort to violence is available to everyone, so it is an unreliable way of controlling people or resources. But there are many reasons why village communities may willingly surrender some control over their resources and labor to trusted leaders. The logic is the same as that of a termite mound. As communities grow, new problems appear for which collective solutions have to be found. Agricultural, economic, and religious activities have to be coordinated more carefully; internal conflicts have to be defused; and conflicts with neighboring communities have to be managed. Handling these problems efficiently is often a matter of life and death, as failure can mean famine, sickness, or defeat in war. But they cannot be solved separately by each household, and thus households acquire an interest in delegating authority. In short, the majority of people in a community may willingly take part in building the simple social dams that concentrate surplus resources in reservoirs controlled by tribal or religious leaders. It may be appropriate to think of these early power structures as analogous to the earliest irrigation channels. These, as we have seen, were simple structures consisting of channels and small dykes, and they could be constructed and maintained with the more or less willing cooperation of entire communities.

Once the decision has been made to delegate authority, it is important to choose good leaders. Several factors may decide how leaders are chosen and what powers they are granted. That many leadership roles involved specialized tasks and skills explains why men occupied them more often than women, for men were less necessary within the household and had more opportunity to take up specialized tasks. Where ranked lineages existed, senior members of senior clans were likely to be chosen as representatives or managers, unless they were plainly incompetent. In internal conflicts, individuals known for their closeness to the gods, their diplomatic skills, or their wisdom were more likely to be chosen; in conflicts with neighbors, those with military skills. Where crises required the help of the gods, those thought to have privileged access to the gods, such as shamans or priests, made likely leaders. Using this authority, religious leaders often collected substantial resources to offer as sacrifices or gifts to the gods.

Sometimes, though, authority was granted in return for past favors, in a modification of the basic rules of reciprocity. This explains an institution whose rules can otherwise seem bizarre to moderns: the “big man.” The label is appropriate, for the role was highly specialized and seems to have been occupied mainly by males. In some form, big men have appeared in many communities in recent times, and the role probably existed in many prehistoric communities as well. The classic studies were conducted in Melanesia in the early twentieth century by the Polish-born British anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. On Bougainville, the big men were known as mumi. The mumi would work hard to accumulate goods for a feast. He would harass his relatives and labor strenuously himself to produce extra goods that had high prestige, such as yams or pigs. Once he had accumulated enough goods, he would give them away at a huge feast. Here is an example, as described by Marvin Harris, from a study of big men on Bougainville: “At a great feast attended by 1,100 people on January 10, 1939, the host mumi, whose name was Soni, gave away thirty-two pigs plus a large quantity of sago-almond puddings. Soni and his closest followers, however, went hungry. ‘We shall eat Soni’s renown,’ the followers said.”26 In commercial terms, such activity makes no sense at all. But in social terms, it does make sense, for gift-giving creates obligations. Gift-giving was to the world of kinship what investment is to the commercial world: the laying out of resources in the hope (which is never certain) of a greater return in the future. Though the holding of such feasts may impoverish the mumi, it also gives him the right to call on the services of those he has put under an obligation.

Anthropologists have observed these feasts or “giveaways” in many societies. One of the best-known examples is the potlatch of American Indian communities of the Pacific Northwest, such as the Kwakiutl. Among the Kwakiutl, chiefs accumulated blankets and other goods, and then gave them away in huge potlatch parties. Sometimes, the services owed to a big man could be turned directly into more significant forms of power—for example, if he asked those now obligated to him to join a raid on a neighboring tribe. The raid, in turn, might take goods that could be used in a new form of redistribution.

Anthropologists recognize an even more significant form of power in prestate societies: the chiefdom. Definitions of chiefdoms are somewhat arbitrary, and none can capture the nuances of the real world, but anthropologists generally use the term to describe the heads of powerful aristocratic lineages who have authority over many lesser villages, groups, and clans, with populations of many thousands. Their authority is usually based on their status within a system of ranked lineages, which may enable them to mobilize considerable resources. In the Trobriand Islands, studied by Malinowski, chiefs could rule many different villages and have thousands of subjects. They often led raids on other islands, and subjects treated them with great deference. Malinowski once saw all the inhabitants of a village suddenly fall flat, as if “mowed down by a hurricane,” at the appearance of their chief.27 Villages supplied their chiefs with yams in fulfillment of kinship obligations. In this way, the chief, through rules of kinship, ended up controlling far more resources than did others. Often these yams were redistributed at feasts, which created new obligations, or they were used to pay for specialists, including warriors and canoe builders. Chiefdoms are not yet states, as they can easily split into separate tribal or clan segments. However, the resources concentrated in the hands of chiefs give them immense power, and sometimes chiefs can use this power to coerce individuals or groups reluctant to accept their authority.

Such forms of power are still limited and precarious. Rulers must conform to the demands of the kin-ordered world in which they live, because they are, in large measure, servants of those they rule. If they don’t fulfill their obligations as leaders, they can quickly lose their influence and their following may fall apart. Anthropologists refer to such structures as segmentary, because they can easily fragment into the segments from which they are assembled.

Despite these limitations, power based on consent may grant leaders control over substantial material and human resources; this feature makes power based on consent the necessary foundation for the construction of larger and more durable power structures. What made possible the transition to more durable and coercive forms of power was the appearance of larger and more concentrated population centers—in particular, the appearance of the first cities.





The First Cities




Cities (at the lower end of level 5 in table 9.1) are more than large villages. In the first towns and cities, wholly humanized environments emerged for the first time. Here, large numbers of people depended entirely on other people to survive, and new forms of complexity and hierarchy appeared. The fundamental precondition for the existence of cities is that productivity levels reach a level such that rural populations can support themselves and a small surplus population of nonfarmers (see figure 9.3). The existence of cities presupposes a complex division of labor, both horizontal and vertical.

The first cities appeared in Mesopotamia. The process in that region has been most closely studied by archaeologists, so I will describe what happened here before asking how typical such processes were.28 In the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates, populations grew rapidly in the fourth millennium BCE. Growth may have been stimulated by climatic changes, for climates became cooler and drier around 3500 BCE, and it was after this that the Sahara, long a region of steppe and savanna, was transformed into arid desert. In some parts of Mesopotamia, the change may have led to a decline in farming; but the south was a region of swamps, with scattered villages occupying small islands. Drier climates made more land available for settlement, and swamplands turned into rich farmland, producing several harvests a year with only the simplest forms of irrigation. The most important crops were wheat, barley, and dates, as well as vegetables of various kinds. Livestock was important and so were fish along the great rivers. Here was a later version of the “gardens of Eden” that lured foragers to settle down in the early Holocene.

(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000), p. 125.



Another factor that may help explain population growth in southern Mesopotamia was the changing topology of regional networks of exchange. Andrew Sherratt has argued that



in early ‘Ubaid times, lowland Mesopotamia was, well, a backwater: just an area of mud. People did live there, in grass huts and using clay sickles, but it was not the most lively spot on earth. Where were the exciting things happening? Two nearby places: the northern arc of the fertile crescent, busily circulating all kinds of stones, metals, and painted pottery … ; and the coasts of the Persian Gulf, about which we know less because a lot of it is under the Mesopotamian mud that accumulated at the river-mouths, but which certainly involved a lively maritime trade down to the present-day Gulf states. The bit in between these was the least important—until the two got together.29





The stream of traders moving along the great rivers was, Sherratt suggests, the opportunity that lowland Mesopotamia needed. As exchanges flourished, what had been a backwater suddenly became a hub region in far-reaching networks of exchanges of obsidian, metals, pottery, and semitropical goods from the south. There took place a sort of “sparking across the gap” between the two resource-rich areas of the Fertile Crescent and the Persian Gulf. Southern Mesopotamia just happened to be in the gap.30 Its rising populations reflected not so much local conditions as the changing topology of networks of exchange reaching across much of Southwest Asia.

Perhaps these two explanations belong together. Increasing aridity forced populations into more concentrated regions of settlement; but it also created narrower corridors for the transmission of long-distance exchanges. Something like this happened in Egypt as well, where populations and, presumably, exchange networks became denser as the Sahara dried out, forcing more and more people to settle along the Nile.31 Whatever the reasons, southern Mesopotamia attracted new settlers, some of whom may have come from lands that were now too arid to farm. Between 3500 and 3200 BCE, the region later known as Sumer became the most densely populated farming region in the world. New settlements were soon organized in hierarchies with three, perhaps even four levels. And at the head of these hierarchies was a group of large regional centers, including Uruk and Nippur.

In the final centuries of the fourth millennium, several of these towns expanded rapidly and turned into true cities—the earliest that we know of. Unlike the villages and towns of the early agrarian era, most of which consisted of similar, self-sufficient households, these had a complex internal division of labor and imported much of their food from elsewhere. Early in the fourth millennium Uruk was a regional center, with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants and several temples. By 3000 BCE it was a city of 50,000 people with well-fortified walls. It consisted of whitewashed mud-brick houses, of a type that can still be found today, with narrow streets running between them. While most were one-story high, wealthier houses often had two stories. In the center, on a ziggurat 12 meters high, stood the “White Temple” (see figure 9.4).

By the early dynastic period (ca. 2900–800 BCE), there were hardly any remaining small settlements in southern Mesopotamia. Almost the entire population of the region now lived in cities. Such dense concentrations of humans had never existed before. Clearly, it was the rich and now well-watered soils of the delta region that made it possible to support such dense populations. But why did so many villagers move into the towns? There was increasing warfare between the region’s expanding towns and cities; villagers may have taken refuge in the towns where they were safer, traveling by day to farm nearby lands. But increasing aridity may also have driven nearby villagers to the towns.

Bernard Knapp, The History and Culture of Ancient Western Asia and Egypt (Chicago: Dorsey, 1988), p. 44: from Helen and Richard Leacroft, The Buildings of Ancient Mesopotamia (Leicester: Brockhampton Press; Reading, Mass.: Young Scott Books, 1974).



Cities, like stars, warped the social space-time of surrounding regions, pulling in the goods, people, and skills of nearby villages and towns. So they automatically become important foci for exchange. Regional networks of exchange acquired more complex and more hierarchical structures, with greater activity, wealth, and knowledge concentrated in the cities. Outlying regions increasingly found that their own futures depended on finding a niche within these new networks of power and wealth.

Cities required new forms of social organization. Hans Nissen has argued that as southern Mesopotamia dried out, planned and carefully managed irrigation became more vital to support the region’s soaring populations.32 Archaeologists have mapped the rapid appearance of dense, planned networks of irrigation channels, particularly around the main population centers. Dependence on large irrigation systems, as well as the need for protection, forced villagers to cooperate more with each other and with the towns, which had the resources and the power to control and maintain the irrigation systems on which they depended. Town leaders could provide levies of labor for digging and clearing channels. They could also handle the complex disputes about water use that are inevitable in communities dependent on large-scale irrigation systems.





The First States: Power Based on Coercion




The “solution” to the many problems created in such dense communities was to establish the first states. But why? We have seen that rudimentary power structures are like simple dams that can create small reservoirs of surplus resources. Cities, however, required larger and more robust social dams. To manage their enormous reservoirs of wealth, they needed structures more like the huge irrigation systems of Sumerian cities. The politics of consensus could no longer handle social engineering on such a scale.

The city was crucial to these changes because it was, by its very nature, a concentrator of power.33 On the one hand, it brought together in one place forms of authority and labor power that had previously been diffused over large areas and between many distinct communities. On the other hand, the creation of such large and dense communities required new forms of power; for as the size of communities grew, the organizational problems they faced became more acute. Cities needed special mechanisms to resolve disputes, to organize exchanges between farmers and specialists, to build warehouses in case of famine, to supply water and remove refuse, to build fortifications and irrigation canals, and to manage war and defense. Fortunately, the economic and demographic processes that created these needs also placed greater resources in the hands of leaders. As the need for central regulation increased, so did the resources available to central authorities. These two factors, in combination, explain why, with the emergence of really large concentrations of people, either in cities (such as southern Mesopotamia) or in regions of dense village settlements and small towns (which was the Egyptian pattern), something like the state was likely to emerge. Where most people lived in cities, as in Mesopotamia, the earliest states were normally city-states, but territorial states emerged in regions such as Egypt where populations were less concentrated and resources had to be mobilized from larger regions.34

The state (at level 5 in table 9.1) differs from the tribe (at the upper edge of level 4) primarily in its ability to coerce systematically and on a large scale.35 States, like chiefs, will often claim to represent “senior lineages,” though these tend to have less and less connection with real lineages. But where traditional forms of loyalty fail, states, unlike chiefs, have at their disposal methods of coercion, paid for out of the huge resources now at their disposal.

The simplest way to imagine state power in its most rudimentary forms is to think of a chief with sufficient resources to pay for an army or retinue. Marvin Harris gives as an example of such power the Bunyoro people of Uganda, who were governed in the nineteenth century by a hereditary ruler known as the mukama.36 He ruled about 100,000 people, who lived mainly by growing millet and bananas. Formally, the mukama was merely the head of a series of chieftains. Like any traditional chief, he was seen as a “great provider” as well as a receiver of tribute. But in practice, his power was based on more than kinship obligations, for he used the large tributes he received to form a palace guard, as well as a retinue of servants, witch doctors, musicians, and so on. His armed attendants gave him the power to deprive individual chiefs or villages of their land. Like King Lear, he and his entire retinue toured the land, demanding that local chiefs and villages support them during their visits.

This is the pattern of many early states that have not yet evolved more bureaucratic forms of taxation. It matches what we know of the earliest Chinese state, that of the Shang.37 The same logic is also apparent in the following passage from the chronicles of medieval Rus’. It concerns the tenth-century CE Grand Prince Vladimir:



On one occasion, … after the guests were drunk, [his retinue] began to grumble against the prince, complaining that they were mistreated because he allowed them to eat with wooden spoons, instead of silver ones. When Vladimir heard of this complaint, he ordered that silver spoons should be moulded for his retinue to eat with, remarking that with silver and gold he could not secure a retinue, but that with a retinue he was in a position to win these treasures, even as his grandfather and his father had sought riches with their followers.38





Vladimir’s remark captures only one half of this crude dialectic of power; in practice, as he knew perfectly well, silver and gold were necessary to buy the soldiers who could help him acquire more silver and gold. In the writings of the Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (r. 913–59 CE), we have a superb description of exactly how Vladimir’s “grandfather and his father” had secured tributes with the help of their armed retinues or ‘druzhiny:



When the month of November begins, their chiefs together with all the Russians at once leave Kiev and go off on “poliudie,” which means “rounds,” that is, to the Slavonic regions of the Vervians and Drugovichians and Krivichians and Severians and the rest of the Slavs who are tributaries of the Russians. There they are maintained throughout the winter, but then once more, starting from the month of April, when the ice of the Dnieper river melts, they come back to Kiev.39





Though states like that of the Bunyoro mukama or Kievan Rus’ in the tenth century CE consist of little more than rulers, using the resources they control to pay a retinue of soldiers, they have clearly crossed the divide from consent-based power to power backed up systematically by coercion. Nevertheless, they are so rudimentary that many political scientists would hardly regard them as states at all, preferring to reserve that term for the more elaborate structures that emerge when rulers can create special bureaucracies and organized armies. At this stage, such structures begin to meet Charles Tilly’s definition of states as “coercion-wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other organizations within substantial territories. The term therefore includes city-states, empires, theocracies, and many other forms of government, but excludes tribes, lineages, firms, and churches as such.”40

But we should not exaggerate the power of even these larger structures. Though they could exercise violence, sometimes in horrifying and spectacular ways, their actual control over the day-to-day activities of most of their populations, particularly in rural areas, was minuscule by comparison with that of modern states. In part this was a matter of the limited energy at their disposal: as John McNeill has pointed out, the energy they controlled consisted mainly of human muscle power, and in practice this means that “the Ming emperors and Egyptian pharaohs had no more power available to them than does a single modern bulldozer operator or tank captain.”41 In part the weakness of preindustrial states reflected their limited bureaucratic reach. In fact, the ready resort of early states to violence and their widespread use of the army to administer it were signs of weakness, not of strength. Traditional states often made up in brutality for what they lacked in administrative reach.42 Anthony Giddens notes, “The ruler may have command over the lives of his subjects in the sense that if they do not obey, or actively rebel, he can put them to the sword. But the ‘power of life and death’ in this sense is not the same as the capability of controlling the day-to-day lives of the mass of the population, which the ruler is not able to do.”43 Traditional states rarely had total control over even the formal military organizations on their lands, and few knew exactly where their own authority ended and that of regional potentates began. Outside the cities, they usually had little authority over the more localized forms of violence used to collect taxes, prosecute offenders or deal with banditry, or right local injustices. These powers were exercised by local elites or kinship groups. For most individuals, the righting of wrongs remained the duty of the household or kin group, which might seek the support of local patrons or officials. And violence was, of course, pervasive even within households, where it was used to maintain the authority of males and seniors.44

But despite these limitations, and despite the absence of a real state monopoly on violence, early states were much more formidable structures than chiefdoms. And everywhere they appear, they are associated with the same cluster of features. These include new forms of specialization and an extensive division of labor, bureaucracies, systems of accounting and writing, armies, and fiscal systems.

Division of Labor In southern Mesopotamia at the end of the fourth millennium BCE, the self-sufficient and relatively egalitarian villages of the early agrarian era were already a thing of the distant past. For at least two thousand years, agriculture had been productive enough to support non-farming populations of priests, potters, and other specialists. Growing specialization can be shown in the appearance of full-time potters beginning in the fifth millennium. Their presence is suggested by the excavation of workshops containing specialized equipment, including potters’ wheels. From the late fourth millennium, there survives an extensive list of different professions, the so-called Standard Professions List.45 This includes priests, officials, and many different kinds of artisans, such as silversmiths, stoneworkers, potters, scribes, and even snake charmers. Many of the professions seem to have been specially organized in guilds of some sort. There existed a complex class structure with god-kings, aristocrats, merchants, artisans, farmers, scribes, and, finally, slaves (most of whom were impoverished farmers or nomads or war captives). The wealth of the rulers can be illustrated from the astonishing tombs of Ur, dated to the end of the fourth millennium, which were excavated by Leonard Woolley Here, rulers were buried with immense wealth, and humans were apparently sacrificed to serve their rulers after death. Merchants were a vital part of the urban division of labor, for cities like Uruk required more goods than could be supplied by nearby farmers. They also needed stone, wood, and luxury goods, which were traded in fleets of ships along the Tigris and Euphrates—some organized by the rulers, others by merchants. At the other end of the spectrum is the evidence for an impoverished class of people consisting of slaves, vagrants, war captives, and failed farmers. The existence of such groups is suggested by the appearance from the early Uruk period of crudely made but apparently mass-produced slant-sided bowls, which were probably used to feed levies of laborers. Lending support to this interpretation is the later symbol for eating, which seems to show a person pouring food into their mouth from one of these bowls.46 It was workers such as these that probably made up the labor armies used to build fortifications and walls and to maintain irrigation channels.

By 3200 BCE, Sumerian society had attained a scale that could no longer be handled within traditional kinship ways of thinking. Society was simply too large and too complex to fit everyone into ever more elaborate models of kinship. Instead, new categories—by occupation, by city of origin, by what modern sociologists would call class or estate—begin to appear. However, kinship thinking remained the basis for relationships at lower levels of society, and this may be why symbolic forms of kinship thinking survived in the religious thought of early states. Rulers frequently portrayed themselves as the “parents’’ of their subjects, and the more powerful gods, too, were often treated as fathers or mothers of particular peoples.

Bureaucracy, Accounting, and Writing Managing the huge resources concentrated in early states was a complex administrative and accounting task. Thus all early states supported officials who kept lists of the things they managed. The need to keep track of the large stores of foodstuffs and other resources stockpiled by the state explains why writing systems appeared in quite separate parts of the world, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, northern India, China, and Mesoamerica, as part of the process of state formation. Writing emerged first as a form of accounting and power, not as a way of recording speech.47 (China may be a partial exception, as the earliest forms of writing there seem to be more concerned with religious activities than with accounting.)48 However it evolved, writing constituted a new way of storing, and therefore controlling, information. Because it did not use the ambiguous symbolism of images, writing made it possible to store knowledge with the precision of spoken language. So writing stabilized and even rigidified empirical knowledge, shielding it from the variability that necessarily accompanies oral transmission. But the skills it demanded were for many millennia confined to elite groups, and primarily to males within those groups. Elites and males therefore benefited most from the capacity to hoard information in writing. Writing provided a powerful way of concentrating in the hands of a few the knowledge accumulated by millions.

In southern Mesopotamia, clay objects, which represented different types of goods, were used as marks of ownerships from as early as the eighth millennium. By the fourth millennium, it was common to bind them together in clay balls, or bullae. From the late fourth millennium period, as the first cities began to emerge, owners started using so-called cylinder seals, which could be rolled across bullae to list their contents. This procedure made the bullae redundant, and soon seals were used to mark flat tablets. Then, instead of using seals, officials began to mark the tablets using reed styli. These worked like pens, carving uniform wedge-shaped (i.e., cuneiform) symbols in the clay. Originally simply pictures of what they represented, these symbols soon became quite stylized (see figure 9.5). At first, even cuneiform writing could do little more than list objects, but this was sufficient for it to function quite effectively as a method of accounting. Most of the writing that survives from Uruk consists of lists of goods received and distributed.

Early in the third millennium, what had begun as a way of keeping records turned into a true writing system, as symbols for things and actions were slowly adapted to more abstract roles, describing emotions and even grammatical functions or separate syllables. Only at this point did writing become more than a system of accounting. The key to these changes was the rebus principle: that is, using an existing symbol for a particular object to represent another word that sounded similar to the first word. Thus, the Sumerian word for “arrow” was pronounced ti. Arrows can easily be drawn. But the word for “life,” a more abstract notion, was also pronounced ti, so the symbol for an arrow could also be used to mean “life.” Slowly, the system of symbols was simplified, though even in 1900 BCE it still had some 600 or 700 elements, making it closer in form to modern Chinese characters than to modern syllabic alphabets.

In Egypt, hieroglyphic writing was used at least from the time of Menes in ca. 3100 BCE. In the Indus valley, writing was used from ca. 2500 BCE. In China, writing systems were in existence by at least 1200 BCE, using signs many of which can still be read today. The first alphabetic systems were developed in the trading cities of Phoenicia in the eastern Mediterranean during the second millennium BCE. They were based on signs for consonants borrowed from Egyptian hieroglyphics. Letters for vowels were not used until the time of the classical Greeks. Creating alphabets with only a small number of letters simplified writing and reading and made literacy available for the first time outside the closed world of trained and highly specialized scribes. But despite this partial democratization of literacy, the power it generated remained a monopoly of elite groups until very recently.

In Mesoamerica, the first writing systems had appeared by ca. 600 BCE in southern Mexico. That the primary function of most early writing systems was to keep accounts is suggested by the counterexample of the Incas, who ruled the only major agrarian civilization without a writing system; they nevertheless had a large bureaucracy that used a system of accounting based on knotted strings, or quipu. It should come as no surprise that all agrarian civilizations have constructed elaborate systems of mathematics as well as writing. They also developed calendars, another vital tool for any complex society that had to coordinate the activities of thousands or millions of people to ensure they paid their taxes on time. Early calendars used the rich astronomical lore that accumulated in all early agrarian era societies and is evident even in remote Britain, in the construction of Stonehenge from the third or second millennium BCE.

Armies and Taxation States can coerce because they can mobilize large retinues or groups of armed men. By the middle of the fourth millennium, most of the settlements in southern Mesopotamia were fortified, which suggests that warfare was common. In the third millennium, both archaeological and written evidence show a world of almost constant warfare. Conflicts were exacerbated by the steady drying of the rivers beginning in the mid–fourth millennium, which, particularly when accompanied by artificial interference in the flow of rivers, led to periodic changes in water courses. At about the end of the early dynastic period, in the first half of the third millennium, the course of the Euphrates shifted to the east of Uruk. The loss of the river led to the rapid decline of Uruk, and to the rise of cities such as Umma and Girsu (in Lagash) that were on the new channel. Such changes caused violent military conflicts, so it is not surprising that the first literatures and chronicles, which appeared in the third millennium, are concerned largely with warfare.

Armies enabled states to mediate in internal conflicts and to tax more effectively. In early states, taxes consisted, overwhelmingly, of foodstuffs collected from peasants and used to feed nobles or government officials, or of labor used to work on noble estates or on government projects.49 Taxation differs from the methods used to collect resources in pre-state societies because of this element of coercion. Indeed, the anthropologist Eric Wolf has argued that this is perhaps the most critical distinction between state and pre-state societies.50





“Tribute-Taking” Societies




In what Wolf calls “kin-ordered” societies, resources are collected largely with the consent of those who contribute them. Once states have appeared, there is always an element of coercion, as resources are collected in the form of taxes, or what Wolf calls “tributes.” This is justification for regarding societies with states as an entirely new type of social structure. Wolf treats the emergence of what he calls “tribute-taking” societies as a major transformation in the lifeways and the organization of human societies. Table 9.3 suggests how his classification of the major “modes of production” fits in with some other familiar social typologies. The social theorist Anthony Giddens makes a similar point in slightly different terminology: “In class-divided societies [Wolf’s “tributary societies”] the extraction of surplus-production is normally backed in a direct way by the threat or the use of force.”51

TABLE 9.3. TYPOLOGY OF MAJOR TECHNOLOGIES AND LIFEWAYS





In some combination, the ingredients described in this chapter were present in all areas of early state formation: in Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, and even the larger Pacific islands such as Tonga and Hawai’i. They include the emergence of dense populations, which generated a complex division of labor that posed new organizational problems, led to increased need for conflict resolution and to more frequent warfare, and encouraged the building of large monumental buildings as well as the creation of some form of writing. Here, there is room to give just one more example—this time from Mesoamerica.

In Mesoamerica, the earliest clear evidence for the existence of sedentary farming communities dates from ca. 2000 BCE. In the Andes, signs of such communities appear slightly earlier, from ca. 2500 BCE.52 After this time, evidence of increasing social complexity, including monumental architecture and two- or three-tiered structures of settlement, appears quite rapidly, until the first state structures can be identified during the first millennium BCE. As in the Old World, it is tempting to see intensification and population growth as the primary motors of change. Settlements with large mounds or pyramids existed in the Andes and Mesoamerica early in the second millennium BCE. These may have been the ceremonial and perhaps market centers for many dependent villages. Their appearance suggests the existence of early forms of chiefdoms.

In the middle of the second millennium, in the lowlands of the gulf region of modern Mexico, there appeared the Olmec civilization. Its populations were supported mainly by swidden agriculture but also, in some regions, by the farming of rich alluvial soils. Like mid-fourth-millennium Mesopotamia, Olmec civilization consisted of large numbers of ranked towns. It also had monumental architecture and craftsmen of great expertise. At sites such as La Venta and San Lorenzo, huge ceremonial centers were constructed, some with pyramids up to 33 meters high. These were originally tombs, for most contain elaborate burials that provide clear proof of steep social and political hierarchies, as well as providing apt symbols of these hierarchies. Constructing the main pyramid at La Venta required at least 800,000 man-days, and some 18,000 people lived in the surrounding town.53 The Olmec made huge and to modern eyes very beautiful statues or monumental heads from chunks of basalt imported from up to 80 kilometers away, presumably by the labor of hundreds of people. The brutality with which some Olmec sites were destroyed shows that there was also organized war. There are hints of early forms of writing, and it may be that the Olmec pioneered the writing systems that evolved in Mesoamerica, whose later versions have only recently been deciphered. Remains of a late Olmec carving that seems to use a dating system similar to that of the Maya suggest that the Olmec may also have invented the dating systems that spread throughout Central America.54 Finally, there is evidence of extensive tributary or trade networks, as obsidian was imported in large amounts from the central Mexican highlands.

In Mesoamerica as in Mesopotamia, while the earliest civilizations developed in well-watered swamplands, civilization shifted gradually into regions of rainfall agriculture. In the Oaxaca valley, about 500 kilometers south of modern Mexico City, in a region of small villages ca. 1300 BCE there began to appear larger settlements, some with larger, apparently public, buildings. After ca. 1000 BCE, the size of these buildings increased rapidly. Populations multiplied, and agricultural production intensified with the building of a large system of canals. There are signs of increased specialization, particularly in crafts such as pottery, and systems of exchange and marketing expand. There are also signs that look like early forms of writing. Then, after 600 BCE, there appears clear evidence of a state-level polity with its capital at Monte Alban. By ca. 400 BCE, there were at least seven small city-states in the Oaxaca valley, so that the region began to look a bit like Sumer late in the fourth millennium. By 200 CE, the population of the entire valley may have reached almost 120,000. At its height, between 200 CE and 700 CE, the capital city of Monte Alban probably had a population of 17,000.55

Though agrarian civilizations appeared some two millennia later in the Americas than in Mesopotamia, the similarities in the history of these two regions suggest once again that state formation was a social explosion whose fuse was lit early in the agrarian era. The demographic dynamism introduced into human history by agriculture ensured that sooner or later, humans, like termites, would face the novel challenge of living in dense communities of their own species. For all the local differences, the solutions humans found in different parts of the world turned out to be remarkably similar to each other—and also strikingly similar to those found by termites and other social insects.





SUMMARY




The technological momentum of the early Holocene generated new technologies that raised output and supported larger and denser settlements. These technologies included shifting agriculture, the secondary products revolution, and irrigation. As communities grew in size, so did the managerial difficulties they faced, and humans found themselves confronting problems much like those of other social animals, such as the social insects. To solve these problems, communities found that they had to grant managerial powers to elite groups. At first, rulers governed with the active consent of their subjects. But over time, they acquired control over large amounts of resources; and in the largest communities, these resources enabled rulers to create more coercive forms of power. So it is no accident that the appearance of the first cities, late in the fourth millennium BCE, also coincides with the appearance of the first states. States mark the birth of a new type of community, which Eric Wolf calls the “tribute-taking” society. In such communities, elite groups used force or the threat of force to control surplus resources. Tribute-taking societies have been the most powerful and the most visible communities for most of recorded human history.





FURTHER READING




The account in this chapter makes much use of Hans Nissen’s account of the rise of states in Sumer in The Early History of the Ancient Near East (1988); it has also borrowed some ideas from Marvin Harris’s classic essay, “The Origin of Pristine States” (1978). Other general surveys can be found in Göran Burenhult, ed., The Illustrated History of Humankind, vols. 3 and 4 (1994); Michael Coe, Mexico (4th ed., 1994); Robert Wenke, Patterns in Prehistory (3rd ed., 1990); Charles Maisels, The Emergence of Civilization (1990); and Bruce Trigger, Early Civilizations (1993). There is a large literature on state formation; Elman Service gives a taste of some of its main ideas in Primitive Social Organization (2nd ed., 1971), as do Robert Cohen and Elman Service, eds., in Origins of the State (1978). Allen Johnson and Timothy Earle, The Evolution of Human Societies (2nd ed., 2000), is the most recent general survey; it adopts an evolutionary approach that many anthropologists would resist. Andrew Sherratt’s essay “The Secondary Products Revolution” (1983) is the classic account of this major technological revolution, while Margeret Ehrenberg’s Women in Prehistory (1989) discusses some possible impacts of these changes on the gender division of labor. Anatoly Khazanov, Nomads and the Outside World (2nd ed., 1994), and Thomas Barfield, The Nomadic Alternative (1993), offer good accounts of pastoralism; Peter Golden, “Nomads and Sedentary Societies in Eurasia” (2001), is a good short introduction. D. T Potts, Mesopotamian Civilization (1997), is a recent study that stresses ecological issues.
