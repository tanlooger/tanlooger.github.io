title: CHAPTER 8 INTENSIFICATION AND THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE
---







The Agricultural Revolution involved restructuring the food economy, shifting from a nomadic life-style based on hunting and gathering [foraging] to a settled life-style based on tilling the soil. Although agriculture started as a supplement to hunting and gathering, it eventually replaced it almost entirely. The Agricultural Revolution entailed clearing one tenth of the earth’s land surface of either grass or trees so it could be plowed. Unlike the hunter-gatherer culture that had little effect on the earth, this new farming culture literally transformed the surface of the earth.





In the geological timescale, the Pleistocene era ends and the Holocene era begins ca. 11,500 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. From about this time, human history sets out in a new direction. A threshold is crossed, with a shift from extensive to intensive technologies. In the Paleolithic era, the increasing ecological power of our species shows up in the exploration of new environments during migrations that took humans around the world. From the early Holocene, it takes the form of intensification: new technologies and lifeways that enabled humans to extract more resources from a given area of land. As a result, though most of human history took place in the Paleolithic era (chronologically speaking), most humans have lived during the last 10,000 years (see figure 8.1).

Loosely, we can refer to the new technologies of the early Holocene as agriculture. They stimulated population growth and encouraged humans to settle in the large, concentrated communities we call villages and towns. Denser settlement encouraged more exchanges of ideas, and stimulated collective learning so that the pace of technological change accelerated. But larger and denser settlements also created novel social and organizational problems, whose solutions required both new social relationships and larger and more complex social structures. Over thousands of years, and at varying speeds, these changes spread through much of the world. They mark the most fundamental change since the evolution of modern humans.

The Paleolithic, agrarian, and modern eras compared by (a) Duration (240,00, 10,000, and 200 years, respectively) (b) The number of humans that lived in each era (ca. 80 billion humans have been born since our species first appeared, according to the estimates of M. Livi-Bacci, A Concise History of World Population [Oxford: Blackwell, 1992], pp. 31, 33). (c) The number of years lived in each era. Because life expectancies have risen dramatically in the modern era, it looms larger when measured by the number of lives lived (estimates from Livi-Bacci, A Concise History of World Population, pp.31, 33).



The dynamism of the Holocene era shows up most clearly as population growth (see figure 8.2, and tables 6.2 and 6.3). We have seen already that in European prehistory, even the earliest forms of farming could support perhaps 50 to 100 times as many people as foraging technologies could in a similar area.1 This is why the transition to agriculture shows up as a clear upward inflection in the graph of world population growth. Of course, our figures for world populations in this period are approximate. Nevertheless, the multiplication of settlement sites in this period shows that populations really did grow more rapidly than in the Paleolithic era. The estimates in tables 6.2 and 6.3 suggest that world populations rose from ca. 6 million in 10,000 BP to about 50 million 5,000 years ago, which implies a six- to twelve-fold increase in 5,000 years.2 On average, populations were doubling every 1,600 years, while in the Upper Paleolithic they doubled, on average, every 6,000 years. These changes mark the start of a new demographic epoch, one whose characteristic long-term growth rates were sustained for almost 10,000 years before accelerating even more decisively in the modern era.

In the 1930s, the Australian archaeologist V. Gordon Childe proposed that this suite of changes be called the “Neolithic Revolution.” Archaeologists first used the term Neolithic (or New Stone Age) to describe distinctive polished stone tools that appear from about 10,000 years ago. But Childe insisted that the real significance of this period lay in something more revolutionary: the emergence of agriculture. Agriculture laid the foundations for all the most important developments of later human history. Today, many prehistorians resist Childe’s term because they know that when examined closely, the changes turn out to have been gradual. Contemporaries could hardly have known they were living through a revolution. Nevertheless, Childe’s notion of a Neolithic or agrarian revolution deserves to survive, for on the scale of human history as a whole, the changes were both rapid and revolutionary (see table 8.1). During a mere 7,500 years, between 11,500 and 4,000 years ago, agricultural communities with domesticated plants and animals appeared in at least three quite separate regions of the world, and perhaps as many as seven. The lifeways pioneered in these regions of “pristine” agriculture then diffused, as agriculturalists migrated to new regions or as other communities incorporated the new techniques into their own lifeways, which may already have been half agricultural. Through a complex blend of migration, diffusion, and local invention and reinvention, agricultural lifeways spread, with many local variations, along existing or newly created networks of exchange to most of the world.

This chapter concentrates on what I will call the early agrarian era. This is the period of human history in which there existed agricultural communities, but no cities and no states. As we will see, its chronology varies from region to region. In some regions, it began 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, and ended about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago; in others, it began much later and survived into the twentieth century.





THE HOLOCENE PERIOD OF HUMAN HISTORY





The End of the Last Ice Age




The coldest phase of the last ice age occurred between about 25,000 and 18,000 years ago. Beginning 18,000 years ago, climates became warmer and wetter, sometimes quite suddenly, though there were also brief returns to glacial conditions (for example, between ca. 13,000 and 11,500 years ago). After ca. 11,500 years ago, climates have remained, for the most part, typical of the warm periods between ice ages known as interglacials, though there have been occasional periods of warmer or cooler weather. All of recorded human history has taken place within the Holocene interglacial.

As climates warmed, the ice sheets covering much of North America, northern Europe and Scandinavia, and eastern Siberia thinned and retreated. As the ice melted, sea levels rose, drowning coastal regions in much of the world. The change was most dramatic in northern latitudes, where lands freed from the weight of the great ice sheets literally floated upward.

Climatic changes transformed landscapes and vegetation.3 Regions of desert and tundra contracted, while forests expanded. In Eurasia and North America, forests migrated into what had been the cold steppes of the Ice Ages, creating some of the largest forested zones in the world. Birch and pine migrated fastest and farthest, followed by deciduous species such as hazel, elm, and oak. In warmer regions of Africa and South America, where forests had largely disappeared, they returned to create tropical forests almost as extensive as the temperate forests of northern latitudes. Where forests spread, they displaced steppe species, such as the herds of mammoth, bison, and horses that had grazed the Ice Age steppes of Eurasia and North America. In place of those animals, they brought species such as boar, deer, and rabbit, together with a whole range of new plant foods such as nuts, berries, seeds, fruit, and fungi. For humans, these species were more difficult to exploit than the large herbivores hunted in northern latitudes during the ice ages. But in some regions these smaller prey species flourished in huge numbers as climates warmed, and their sheer quantity made them more attractive. Between 10,000 and 5500 BP, increased humidity turned what is now the Sahara Desert into a lush region of lakes and woodlands, whose inhabitants have left astonishing rock paintings of lifeways that are inconceivable in the dry Sahara of today.

While plants and animals had to adapt to climatic change, so did human beings. But they adapted in different ways in different parts of the world; thus human societies became more diverse during the Holocene.





Three Worlds




As sea levels rose early in the Holocene, the land bridges between Siberia and Alaska, Japan and China, Britain and Europe, and Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Tasmania were all drowned. Indonesia, a southern peninsula of Asia during the Ice Age, became an island archipelago, and the gap between Indonesia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea widened. With humans now settled throughout the world, this severing of ancient links threatened to divide humans into separate populations with separate histories. As Robert Wright nicely puts it: “The Old World and the New World were now two distinct petri dishes for cultural evolution.”4

The separation was at no time complete. The arrival of the dingo in Australia perhaps 4,000 years ago, or of Indonesian trepang fishers in recent centuries, proves that Australia was never totally cut off from Indonesia and Asia. And Papua New Guinea certainly had contacts with Austronesian migrants to Indonesia from ca. 1600 BCE onward.5 The narrowness of the gap across the Bering Straits and the brief settlement by Vikings of a colony in Newfoundland show that the Americas were never totally cut off from Eurasia. Moreover, the presence of South American sweet potatoes in Polynesia demonstrates that there must have been some contact between the Americas and the various communities that settled the Pacific during the past 3,000 years. Nevertheless, these contacts were so limited that it makes sense to think of human history during much of the Holocene era as taking place within three distinct world zones, with the addition of a fourth—the Pacific zone—in the past 4,000 years.6 The major world zones of the Holocene were the Afro-Eurasian zone, which includes Africa and the entire Eurasian land-mass, as well as offshore islands such as Britain and Japan; the Americas, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, as well as offshore islands such as those of the Caribbean; Australia and Papua New Guinea; and from ca. 4,000 years ago, the island societies of the Pacific (see maps 8.1 and 8.2).

Within each of these world zones, it was possible, in principle at least, for ideas, influences, technologies, languages, and even some goods to travel from one end to the other. There was always indirect contact between Papua New Guinea and Australia across the island chain of the Torres Strait. Within Australia, prestige goods such as pearl shells from the northwest traveled in relays across much of the continent, while “baler shells” from Cape York in the far northeast were made into ornaments that were used in rituals and sorcery as far away as southern Australia and the deserts of western Australia.7 The islands of Polynesia and Micronesia were settled in a series of linked migrations by communities whose similarities are apparent in language and in the archaeological remains of the so-called Lapita cultures.8 In Afro-Eurasia, the Sahara was a region of steppe and savanna land until ca. 4,000 years ago, and thus sub-Saharan Africa was not as separate from the rest of the region as it has been since then. Technologies of pastoralism originated in both Inner Eurasia and Saharan Africa; from there they spread through the Eurasian steppes and to eastern Siberia in one direction and to the Middle East and East Africa in another. Indo-European languages spread to Sinkiang, India, and western Europe; Afro-Asiatic languages spread through much of Africa and also into the Middle East; and Turkic languages spread from Mongolia to Anatolia. In the Americas, early migrants traveled, generation by generation, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, creating, as the linguist Joseph Greenberg has shown, a coherent linguistic zone embracing all of South America and most of North America as well.9

It will be helpful to think of each of these regions as a separate world zone during much of the Holocene, because doing so can help us distinguish between universal and regional trends. There are astonishing parallels between the histories of these worlds, but there are also striking and important differences. Intensification of some kind occurred in all world zones, and the steady growth of human adaptive capacity that was already evident in the Paleolithic era continued right around the globe. But the pace of change varied, and so did the nature of the adaptations that emerged in each zone. Explaining both the similarities and the differences between these different histories will be a central task of the next three chapters.10





WHAT IS AGRICULTURE?




Of all forms of intensification in the early Holocene era, agriculture is by far the most important. But what is agriculture?

Like the fire stick “farmers” discussed in the previous chapter, agriculturalists systematically groom the environment to favor those plant and animal species they find most useful. But agriculture raises productivity to a particular degree, by grooming so intense that it eventually transforms favored species through an early form of artificial selection. It depends on the early form of genetic engineering known as domestication.





Domestication




Domestication is a symbiotic process in which one species, instead of just preying on another, protects the second species and encourages its reproduction, so as to create a more reliable source of food. We have seen that this pattern of co-evolution, leading from predation to symbiosis, is common in evolutionary history, and there is a good Darwinian logic to it. Because excessively brutal predation may kill off the prey species, the most effective predators (both large and small) are those that take their prey selectively, and even try to ensure the prey’s survival as a species. Both species benefit from such a relationship. While the predator gains more control over an important food source, the prey species finds a protector happy to ensure its survival and reproduction—at a price. Sheep and maize would not be as abundant as they are if humans had not domesticated them. Domestication occurs among many different species. There are, for example, species of ants that treat aphids more or less like domestic cattle, in return for honeydew. With their antennae they stroke the captive aphids to stimulate the production of honeydew. In return for their honeydew, the ants take care of the aphids and ensure their successful reproduction.11

No sharp dividing line exists between predation and domestication. But in tight symbiotic relationships, both species change, behaviorally or genetically, until a point is reached at which one or both can no longer survive without the other. In human history, the genetic changes have occurred principally in the domesticated species. Humans have also changed genetically—for example, some have acquired an increased capacity to digest the raw milk of domesticated animals. But the most significant human adaptations have been behavioral and cultural. The greater speed of cultural change explains why symbioses with humans developed much faster than symbiotic relations between nonhumans.

Domestication describes that stage of the symbiosis at which at least one of the partners cannot survive on its own. In the case of agriculture, this means that domesticates can no longer survive or reproduce without human support, while many human communities can no longer live without their preferred domesticates. Domesticated sheep are too slow and stupid to survive in the wild, and modern maize, or Indian corn, cannot reproduce without human help, as its seeds cannot scatter freely.12 In a recent account of agricultural origins, Bruce Smith defines domestication as “the human creation of a new form of plant or animal—one that is identifiably different from its wild ancestors and extant wild relatives.”13 The creation of new species of animals begins when humans start controlling how their animals reproduce and cut them off from contact with wild populations. With domesticated plants, it begins with harvesting, planting, and weeding, for these practices remove domesticates from genetic contact with neighboring populations and give them an artificial head start over their “wild” cousins. In both cases, human intervention places a barrier between the wild and the domesticated species. This encourages rapid genetic changes in a manner similar to allopatric speciation, though here it is humans, rather than migrations or geographical changes, that have created the genetic barriers between populations of the same species.

Once humans start separating a population from its wild relatives, it can evolve rapidly.14 Certain changes are familiar to archaeologists. Domesticated seed plants often have tight clusters of seeds that are more firmly attached to the stem than those in wild varieties, because humans find it easiest to collect (and therefore to replant) thick concentrations of seeds; moreover, isolated seeds or those loosely attached to the stem are likely to fall off during harvesting, so they are unlikely to be replanted. Domesticated plants also tend to develop large seeds with thin skins, for similar reasons. Where plants are planted closely together and competition for sunlight is fierce, those seedlings that sprout first are most likely to survive; and these are likely to have thin skins and larger internal food stores, which give them an edge over their rivals. The fattest, fruitiest, and earliest sprouting plants are also more likely to be selected by humans for replanting. So, when looking for evidence of domestication, paleobotanists look for seeds that are larger and have thinner skins than the wild varieties, that are held together in clusters, and that are more tightly held to the stem by a strong rachis (i.e., connecting axis). Domesticated animals undergo analogous changes, though these are usually harder to detect in the archaeological record. Decreasing size is a common marker, whether caused by deliberate selection for more docile, manageable beasts or by poorer nutrition under conditions of domestication. Different herd composition is another marker. Often, females outnumber males in domestic herds, because males are culled early. The old are also more likely to be culled in domestic herds.

Agriculture is not a synonym for domestication. Many societies have adopted limited forms of domestication, either of plants or animals, without becoming dependent on them and without becoming sedentary. And while pastoralists are as dependent on domesticates as are agriculturalists, they rely principally on animal rather than plant domesticates. In addition, pastoralists, like foragers, are often nomadic. In contrast, agriculturists normally exploit both domesticated plants and animals, and most are sedentary. Though agriculturalists may still hunt and fish, the subsistence basis of their communities comes from their domesticates. Finally, plant domesticates are usually more important than animal domesticates in agricultural societies. This is a consequence of the basic ecological rule that organisms lowest on the food chain transmit the energy of sunlight most efficiently. At each step in the food chain, about 90 percent of that energy is lost; thus, human lifeways depending mainly on plant-based foods can normally support larger population densities than lifeways (such as pastoralism) dependent mainly on animal-based foods. So plant domesticates account for most of the demographic dynamism of the agricultural revolution.

As table 8.2 shows, the domestication of different species of plants and animals continued throughout the Holocene, and occurred, apparently quite independently, in several different parts of the world. However, these figures simply reflect the earliest evidence of domestication. The step from domestication to lifeways based mainly on agriculture was rapid in some areas (such as Southwest Asia, central Asia, and China) but slower elsewhere—particularly in the Americas, where there is a gap of several thousand years between the earliest signs of domestication and the earliest evidence of life-ways based mainly on agriculture.





Chronology and Geography of Early Domestication




Additional research may push the dates recorded in table 8.2 farther back in time, perhaps by centuries, in some cases by millennia. Researchers may also identify other centers of domestication that have been missed so far. Likely candidates may appear in the tropics, particularly in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and in the Amazonian rain forests (where the main crops were manioc, potato, and peanut). In parts of Papua New Guinea, taro was probably being cultivated some 9,000 years ago; by 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, true agriculture was supporting permanent villages in forest clearings throughout the country, using indigenous (or perhaps imported) species of taro and yams as staples.15

Writing more than a century ago, Francis Galton suggested that the first steps to domestication involved a sort of ecological “audition.” Humans probably “auditioned” numerous prey species, but many failed their try-out because they lacked some crucial quality necessary to make them viable domesticates. The failures included deer (which proved too skittish) as well as acorns and hazelnuts (which proved less nutritious and harder to store than domesticated cereals and legumes, though both continued to be used as famine foods). The first species successfully domesticated by humans was probably the wolf. Wolves were domesticated late in the Upper Paleolithic, and all breeds of modern domestic dogs are descended from these early domesticates.16 But domesticated wolves did not have the transformative impact of later domesticated species, for instead of offering an alternative to foraging lifeways, they were used to help with the hunt.

TABLE 8.2. FIRST RECORDED EVIDENCE OF DOMESTICATES





The “Neolithic revolution” really begins with the domestication of a small number of seed plants. The earliest evidence for this change comes from Southwest Asia, along the narrow corridor linking Africa and Eurasia into the largest premodern exchange network on Earth. It is probably no accident that agriculture appeared first within the largest and oldest world zone, that of Afro-Eurasia. Nor is it an accident that it occurred in the corridor linking two very different regions, for “hub” regions of this kind (see chapter 10 for a fuller discussion) were clearinghouses for ecological information accumulated over huge areas. Another hub region, in Mesoamerica, linked North and South America; and here, too, agriculture appeared early.

The earliest agrarian sites in Afro-Eurasia are concentrated in a region known to archaeologists as the Fertile Crescent. This is an arc of mainly high land that runs northward through parts of modern Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon, then curves eastward along the border between Turkey and Syria before turning south along the Zagros Mountains on the Iraq-Iran border. Between 11,000 and 9000 BP, at least eight different species of plants were domesticated in this region. They include lentils, peas, chickpeas, bitter vetch, flax, and the cereals—emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, and barley. The three cereal crops all seem to have been domesticated in the region near Jericho, between 11,500 and 10,700 BP, probably by communities that had once harvested them in the wild.17 Within these few centuries, all three cereals underwent the changes usually associated with domestication. They developed larger seeds and a tough stalk holding the seeds to the stem.

Sheep and goats were probably domesticated in the north of the Fertile Crescent by communities that had previously hunted them. However, on the whole, animals seem to have been domesticated slightly later than plants. Indeed, the presence of crops that could be used as fodder may have been a prerequisite for animal domestication in many areas. Pigs were domesticated in the north of the Fertile Crescent, along the modern border between Turkey and Syria.18 Unlike sheep and goats, they compete with humans for food, which may be why they were domesticated later. Cattle were also domesticated later than sheep and goats. The earliest certain remains of domesticated cattle date to about 9300 BP. 19 The delay may be because their wild ancestor, the aurochs, was a dangerous beast. (We know this because wild aurochs survived until three centuries ago: the last was drawn in Poland in the early seventeenth century CE.) However, like sheep and goats, aurochs were also gregarious. This meant it was possible to control whole herds by taming or supplanting their leaders.20 In cattle, as in sheep and goats, domestication soon led to genetic changes as animals with undesirable characteristics such as skittishness or aggression (or even intelligence!) were culled.

China was a second area of early domestication. Recent research has shown that it occurred earlier there than was once thought. Rice was probably domesticated in southern China along the Yangtze River, about 9,500 to 8,800 years ago, by foragers who had previously harvested wild rice. Millet was domesticated along the Yellow River in northern China by 8,000 years ago. Pigs may have been domesticated independently in the north. By the eighth millennium BP, both the millet-based systems of northern China and the rice-based systems of southern China were well established.

A third wave of domestication occurred between 6000 and 4000 BP. African forms of millet and sorghum were domesticated south of the Sahara beginning at least 4,000 years ago, and maybe considerably earlier. The different conditions, and the appearance of domesticates quite distinct from those of the Fertile Crescent, suggest that domestication in sub-Saharan Africa was little influenced by what had happened in Southwest Asia.

Recent research suggests that in the Americas, domestication occurred later than was once believed. Nowhere is there now firm evidence of thoroughgoing domestication before about 5500 BP. This is the date of the earliest sample of domesticated maize found so far, from the Tehuacán Valley of Mesoamerica, southeast of modern Mexico City. Maize is descended from a wild species known as teosinte; together with beans and varieties of squash, it was to become the most important of all American plant domesticates. South America was the only region of the Americas in which animal domesticates played a significant role. Here, guinea pigs, llamas, and alpacas were domesticated at least by ca. 4000 BP, at about the same time as quinoa and potatoes. Animal domesticates were less important in the Americas, because the most promising potential domesticates, including horses and camels, had become extinct there at the end of the last ice age, probably because of human overpredation. Indeed, it is possible that the long gap in American prehistory before early forms of domestication and settled agriculture can be explained in part by the small number of potential animal domesticates that survived the first wave of human migrations to the region.21

Domestication also occurred in the third world zone, in Papua New Guinea. Here, it occurred early, but its impact was more limited than in the other world zones.

Once it had appeared, agriculture did not sweep all before it. Indeed, from a modern perspective, what is striking about the period covered in this chapter is how slowly agriculture spread. Though some communities began to depend primarily on their domesticates and became true agriculturalists, many others preserved their traditional foraging lifeways while adopting one or two domesticates as supplements. In Papua New Guinea, populations of farmers coexisted with neighboring foragers until modern times. In the Americas, the slowness with which domestication spread is most apparent in the communities of eastern North America that domesticated sunflowers and gourds. Here, the lack of suitable potential domesticates may explain agriculture’s slow progress. Although agricultural lifeways were well developed to their south by the time they began to plant and cultivate local domesticates, about 4,000 years ago, hunting and gathering remained important for almost another 3,000 years, because the local domesticates could not supply a complete nutritional package. When Mexican maize arrived ca. 1,800 years ago, it did not flourish. Not until the introduction about 1,100 years ago of new strains of maize that could cope with the northern winters, as well as Mexican beans and squash, did agriculture take off in this region.22

In northeastern Africa, along the Nile, the suite of domesticated animals and plants typical of the Fertile Crescent appeared after 9000 BP (of these, only barley was indigenous to Egypt), but it took several thousand years before agricultural villages spread widely. In Europe, domestication spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Balkans and the Mediterranean coast of Italy and France beginning about 9,000 years ago. From there it spread north into temperate zones with distinctive climates and ecologies, where methods of domestication had to be modified before they could succeed. At one time, it seemed possible to trace a clear “wave of advance” of agriculture through Europe between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago. However, more detailed studies have shown that though domestication did spread through Europe, its progress was slower and less triumphal than had first appeared. Agrarian communities settled particularly in regions of easily worked loess soils. But elsewhere, especially in the northwest and northeast of the subcontinent, they had only a limited impact for several millennia. Instead, local communities of foragers often adopted some agrarian techniques and maintained trading relations with agrarian communities, without themselves becoming true farmers. Domestication and the agrarian lifeways associated with it remained merely options or supplements to foraging lifeways; in many parts of the Neolithic world, foragers and agriculturalists were linked in regional networks of exchange.

Similar patterns can be seen in other areas that were influenced but not dominated by agriculture during the early agrarian era, from Russia west of the Urals to central Asia and northern Mexico.





THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE




How can we explain the transition to agriculture?23

It may seem that the question is easy to answer. Processes of collective learning ensured that human communities would continue to explore ways of extracting resources from their environment, and eventually they were bound to stumble on agriculture. Besides, agriculture was so much more productive than most foraging lifeways that it is tempting to suppose that once it had been “invented,” it was bound to spread fast. The earliest attempts to explain the Neolithic revolution did indeed make these assumptions, seeing agriculture as an invention that spread from a single epicenter because of its inherent superiority to all other human adaptations.

However, research in the twentieth century revealed two significant problems with such explanations. First, as we have seen, agriculture did not in fact spread from a single center. Instead, it appeared, apparently independently, in many different regions of the world, in all three world zones. How can we explain the near-simultaneity of these changes in parts of the world that seem to have had no contact with each other? As Mark Cohen has stressed, “The most striking fact about early agriculture, … is precisely that it is such a universal event.”24

Second, we can no longer assume that communities of foragers were bound to adopt agriculture once they learned about it. Indeed, we are no longer so confident that the appearance of agriculture can automatically be regarded as a sign of progress. To be sure, agriculture can support larger populations than foraging lifeways, and thus in the long run agricultural communities are likely to outcompete foraging communities when the two life-ways come into conflict. But it is also clear that many foraging communities have resisted adopting agricultural practices even when they knew about them. As members of a foraging community in the Kalahari Desert told a modern researcher, why would one want to work as a farmer when there are so many mongongo nuts available to eat? In the far north of Australia, particularly in Cape York, Aboriginal populations knew about farming, because islanders to their north practiced it. But they chose not to adopt it. In Russia and Ukraine, too, foragers and farmers coexisted, perhaps for several thousand years after farmers entered the region some 6,000 to 7,000 years ago.25 Foragers saw agriculture as an option, but not an inevitability.

And their conservatism may have been perfectly rational. Evidence from skeletal remains shows that early agriculture bred new forms of disease and new forms of stress.26 Farmers have less varied diets than foragers in warm climates, so they are more subject to periodic shortages; foragers can more easily switch to alternative sources of food. Famine is a paradoxical by-product of the agricultural revolution. Farming communities are also more subject to diseases carried by the rats, mice, bacteria, and viruses that flourish in moderately large sedentary communities. Even more important, genetic comparisons of modern disease bacteria suggest that in Afro-Eurasia, where livestock were domesticated, disease bacteria spread easily from herd animals such as cattle, chickens, and pigs to humans. The diseases exploited the fact that humans, too, became herd animals once they settled down to farm in village communities.27 The most successful strains, and the ones that survived longest to become endemic, were those—including smallpox and flu—that infected their human hosts without killing them. A further sign of declining health in early agrarian communities may be that Neolithic skeletons seem to be shorter, on average, than those of Stone Age foraging societies; moreover, there is no evidence that life expectancies rose or infant mortality declined with the appearance of early forms of farming.28 In both types of society, no more than 50 percent of all children born could expect to reach adulthood; those who did generally had a life expectancy of no more than about 25 to 30 years, though some individuals may have lived into their 50s and 60s.29 All in all, it seems that the appearance of agriculture did more to depress standards of human welfare than to raise them. John Coatsworth writes: “Bioarchaeologists have linked the agricultural transition to a significant decline in nutrition and to increases in disease, mortality, overwork, and violence in areas where skeletal remains make it possible to compare human welfare before and after the change.”30

Any adequate account of the origins of agriculture must explain both the chronology of early agriculture and the reasons why communities of foragers took up agricultural lifeways despite their apparent drawbacks. Why would one prefer a lifeway based on the painful cultivation, collection, and preparation of a small variety of grass seeds, when it was so much easier to gather plants or animals that were more varied, larger, and easier to prepare?





Explanatory “Prime Movers” in the Neolithic Revolution




Modern attempts to explain the Neolithic revolution date from the 1920s. The Russian geneticist N. I. Vavilov studied modern relatives of domesticated plants in the belief that the areas of their greatest genetic variety would prove to be where they originated, and probably where they were first cultivated. He identified eight likely “hearth areas’’ for early agriculture. Vavilov’s list of hearth areas resembles modern lists of this kind, and the principle that studies of modern plants can tell us a lot about the early history of domesticates underpins the modern science of paleobotany. V. Gordon Childe argued that climatic change may have created “oases” of dense settlement whose inhabitants were forced to intensify their production methods in order to survive. In its general form, the position still has some plausibility, though the details of his original argument no longer stand. Robert Braidwood undertook the first systematic archaeological investigations of early agriculture in Iraq, studying two villages, Karim Shahir and Jarmo: the first was occupied by foragers, the second by agriculturalists. And Richard MacNeish pioneered the study of early agriculture in the Americas in a series of expeditions, begun in the late 1940s, that were devoted to the early history of maize.31

Since these pioneering studies, an immense amount of research on the origins of agriculture has been undertaken. It is now reasonably clear what the main components are, but we do not yet know exactly how they are interwoven. The main factors include climatic change; various forms of intensification among foragers; population growth, which in some regions forced communities of foragers to exploit smaller territories and use them more intensively; increasing exchanges between communities; and, finally, the availability of potential domesticates. Any explanation must include some combination of these elements. The following account combines the insights of several closely related models and data from several different regions, though it best fits what we know of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent. It argues that there were several distinct stages in the evolution of agriculture, which occurred, with minor modifications, in all regions of early domestication.32

As the reader will see, the simplified account offered here is different from the triumphalist accounts of the early twentieth century. Instead, like the story in Genesis, it describes a temptation, a fall, and an expulsion.

Cultural Preadaptations and Ecological Know-How Most Upper Paleolithic communities knew many of the things that farmers need to know. Technologically, they were preadapted for agriculture. We assume this is so because modern foraging communities must have a sophisticated understanding of the plants and animals in their environment. They know the conditions under which favored species flourish, and they know how to nurture and encourage those species they favor—for example, by removing weeds or other rivals. Most small-scale societies understand that plants grow from seeds or cuttings, and that human activities can stimulate or inhibit growth.33 Donald O. Henry has described the ecological know-how of Paleolithic peoples as one of the “necessary” conditions for the appearance of agriculture.34

It is also certain that significant forms of intensification appeared among foragers who had little or no contact with agriculture. Such communities are often referred to by anthropologists as “affluent foragers.” The previous chapter has already described the astonishing mammoth-hunting cultures of late Paleolithic Ukraine and mentioned the dense populations of southern France, which lived by harvesting the large stocks of game and fish just south of the European ice sheets. Wherever we see foraging communities becoming more sedentary, we know they are using more intensive technologies, because to stay in one place for long periods they have to use its resources more intensively. But intensification of this kind becomes much more apparent early in the millennia after the end of the last ice age. In some form, intensification appears in all three world zones, and in all three it led to some degree of sedentism (i.e., the practice of establishing a permanent or semipermanent settlement). It is important to insist on this point, as it is often thought that some parts of the world simply stagnated after agriculture had originated in a few favored regions.

In Australia there is now plenty of evidence of intensification, particularly in the past 5,000 years. Intensification enabled populations to increase, and in some areas it led to sedentism. Stone tools become much more varied during this period. New, smaller, and more finely made stone tools appear in many parts of Australia, including small points in Central Australia that may have been used as spear tips (there is no evidence of bows and arrows in Australia). Some stone points were so beautifully made that they were treated as ritual objects and traded over hundreds of miles. Elsewhere, backed blades were made, probably to be set in rows in weapons such as the terrifying “death spears,” whose serrated edges ensured that the wounds they inflicted were almost always fatal.35 The dingo, a semidomesticated dog, appeared about 4,000 years ago, and as it is closest to modern species of Indian dogs, it probably came from across the Indian Ocean rather than from Indonesia.36

New techniques meant new ways of extracting resources. In the Australian state of Victoria, elaborate eel traps were built, in some cases incorporating canals up to 300 meters long (see figure 8.3). Josephine Flood describes them:



Traps were built across the stone races and canals; nets or eel pots were set in apertures in the stone walls, which were often constructed in a V-shape. The eel pots were made from strips of bark or plaited rushes with a willow hoop at the mouth. The tapered shape allowed men standing behind the weirs to grab the eels as they emerged through the narrow end of the pot. The fishermen killed the eels by biting them on the back of the head.37





So many eels could be stored and harvested in these traps that they attracted substantial and relatively permanent settlements (see figure 8.4). The survival of clusters of low stone huts (in one case, up to 146 at a single site) confirms the reports of early European visitors that there were Aboriginal villages in the area.38 These communities lived off the many local species of game, from emu to kangaroos, as well as local vegetable foods such as daisy yam tubers, ferns, and convolvuluses.

In coastal regions of Australia, shell fishhooks were an innovation that gave access to new sources of food and enabled population growth. Some communities began to harvest plants such as yam, fruits, and grains in ways that suggest an incipient agriculture. The techniques for harvesting yams used then (and today) encouraged regrowth; fruit seeds were deliberately planted in refuse heaps to create fruit groves. In some of the more arid areas of Central Australia, European travelers observed communities harvesting wild millet with stone knives and storing it in large hayricks. Grindstones used on seeds have been found dating back as far as 15,000 years in some regions, demonstrating that these practices were very old.39

Similar changes occurred in many parts of the world toward the end of the Paleolithic and early in the Holocene. In Mesoamerica, there are signs from as early as 9,000 to 10,000 years ago of the intensive exploitation of several species that would later become agricultural staples, including early forms of maize, beans, and squashes. Some coastal communities in Mesoamerica enjoyed such abundant marine resources that they became largely sedentary from perhaps 5,000 years ago.40 In the Baltic region of northwestern Eurasia, signs of intensification also appear soon after the end of the last ice age. Brian Fagan notes:



The Mesolithic peoples who lived along the shores of the newly emerging Baltic Sea developed an astonishing range of fish spears, nets, harpoons, and traps, many of them preserved in waterlogged sites. Spears and arrows were tipped with tiny stone, bone, or antler barbs. Ground-edged tools were used for woodworking and processing forest plants. Large canoes, some of them dugouts hollowed from tree trunks, were in evidence.41





These were stable and largely sedentary communities of affluent foragers. They relied on hunting, fishing, and the collecting of plant foods. Some Baltic settlements were huge. Archaeologists have found year-round sites in which as many as 100 people may have lived. Some of these sites were occupied continuously from ca. 3000 to 1500 BCE. 42

Early evidence of affluent foragers has also been found along the Nile valley, in southern Egypt and Sudan. Near Aswan, 18,000 years ago, communities hunted large game, fished (which presumably meant they were reasonably sedentary), and also ground flour from wild grasses; at a nearby site, dated to ca. 15,000 years ago, there are stone blades covered with a sheen that indicates they were used for harvesting wild grains.43 But the best-known affluent foragers of this era are the Natufian communities that appeared about 14,000 BP along the eastern Mediterranean coast in parts of modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria and survived for more than 2,000 years. Sediment cores have shown that the Natufian community of Ain Mallaha, which flourished ca. 13,000 years ago in the upper Jordan valley, had access to wild cereals and acorns, as well as lakeside resources such as fish, turtle, shellfish, and lake birds, which they caught using nets and hooks.44 Natufian communities also hunted gazelle. With such abundant resources available nearby, they began to settle down in villages that were often six or seven times as large as any earlier settlements in the region, containing up to 150 people.

In all these areas, communities of foragers were pioneering new techniques, some of which involved more careful tending of plant and animal resources. Occasionally, these new techniques allowed entire communities to become more or less sedentary. These changes mark important steps on the path to agriculture.

As human technologies changed, they began to affect nearby species, particularly those exploited most intensively. For example, foragers might bring favored plant species back to base camps where, over several years, their seeds would form stands of plants ready for consumption by later generations of foragers. Such practices can exert powerful selective pressures, for it is obvious that over time, those fruit that taste best are most likely to be seeded around human campsites, while wild populations may remain less “tasty.”45 Over time, such intense manipulation of particular plant populations can lead to significant genetic changes.

Genetic Preadaptations and Potential Domesticates Some species were more amenable to selective manipulation than others. Indeed, some potential domesticates appear in retrospect to have been preadapted for domestication. And this fact constitutes the second “necessary condition” for agriculture listed by Henry. Further, as Vavilov argued, the distribution of these potential domesticates offers a useful explanation for the geography and the “style” of domestication in different regions. Of the many wild species auditioned by humans as potential domesticates, few passed the test, and in some areas none did. Indeed, the availability or nonavailability of nutritious and easily domesticable plants and animals may have been a crucial determinant of the geography of early agriculture, and therefore a crucial determinant of much later human history.46 Of several hundred thousand plant species, only a few hundred have been domesticated successfully, and most of these are of marginal importance when compared to the dozen major crops that provide most of the world’s food today.

The qualities humans sought in potential domesticates were hardiness, nutritional value, adaptability, and the ability to breed under varying conditions. Animals had to be sociable; able to live and breed in large, compact herds; and characterized by social hierarchies that predisposed them to follow leaders, whether animal or human. The nature of the available domesticates may also help explain the chronology of early domestication. Jared Diamond has argued persuasively that the potential domesticates available in the Fertile Crescent were unusually varied, attractive, and easy to domesticate and that those features go a long way toward explaining why agriculture appeared first in this region. The ease of domestication of the region’s main cereal crops can be demonstrated by the remarkably small change they have undergone from their wild state; wild barleys and wheats were abundant, nutritious, and easy to harvest and grow. In contrast, the domestication of maize was much trickier; teosinte had to be trained for several millennia before it could support large populations.47 The lack of potential animal domesticates after the megafaunal extinctions of the early Holocene era also slowed the adoption of agriculture in Mesoamerica. There, only the dog and turkey were domesticated, and neither was as valuable as the main animal domesticates of the Fertile Crescent. The paucity of animal domesticates deprived American farmers of traction power, manure, and a rich source of protein. In Papua New Guinea, too, the nutritional limitations of local domesticates such as taro, which contains little protein, lessened the demographic impact of agriculture and restricted its spread.

The existence of potential domesticates and of much relevant ecological knowledge constitutes crucial preconditions for agriculture. But these factors cannot explain the timing or the motivation for the transition to fully developed agriculture.

Climatic Change, Population Pressure, and Exchanges Given that agriculture emerged in several widely separated parts of the world within the relatively short span of a few millennia, it is tempting to look for global mechanisms that might have triggered change in different locations. Two possible triggers are climatic change and population pressure.

The climatic changes at the end of the last ice age were erratic and unpredictable. However, their most general effect was to raise average temperatures. Whatever their precise direction and nature, these changes must have stimulated cultural as well as genetic shifts throughout the world. As climates and environments altered, human communities had to experiment with new foods and new techniques. This was particularly true in areas such as the Eurasian steppes, where a combination of overhunting and global warming drove traditional prey species such as mammoth out of the lands they had once inhabited.

Climatic change also transformed environments. In some regions, warming climates increased the availability of both plant and animal foods. Henry argues that potential plant domesticates may have been rare before the end of the last ice age, pointing out that under colder conditions, ancestral forms of rice, cereals, and maize would have been isolated and confined to lowland regions. However, with the spread of warmer and wetter climates, they became more abundant and spread to upland regions. There, milder conditions encouraged them to produce seeds over a longer period, which made them more valuable for humans. This argument finds most support in the Fertile Crescent, where the spread of cereals can be traced by pollen studies. But it seems likely that the warmer, wetter conditions of the early Holocene increased the range and number of warmth-loving plants such as cereals in many parts of the world. Abundance was particularly great in regions with good supplies of water from rivers, lakes, or marshes, while regions with varied ecologies produced an increasing variety of plant and animal foods. In southeastern Turkey, as an experiment conducted by Jack Harlan showed in the 1970s, it was possible even under modern conditions, and in only three weeks, to harvest enough wild grain to support a family for an entire year. Increasing abundance of nutritious plant foods may in turn have attracted herbivores. And eventually, such “gardens of Eden” would have attracted humans, too. Where resources were particularly abundant, foraging communities may have become more settled, thereby perhaps taking a crucial step toward agriculture.

The second global factor is harder to identify in the archaeological record but equally hard to exclude from any account of agricultural origins: population pressure. The argument that population growth, far from being limited by available technologies (the familiar Malthusian argument), may create pressure for technological change in agriculture has been developed in the work of Ester Boserup, but Mark Cohen has done the most to explore its possibilities as an explanation for the origins of agriculture. His argument, essentially, is that population pressures encouraged individuals and groups to move to less densely settled regions. The eventual result was that population pressure by the early Holocene was so evenly distributed “that groups throughout the world would be forced to adopt agriculture within a few thousand years of one another.”48 There are several reasons to think that population pressures grew at the end of the last ice age, particularly in the Afro-Eurasian zone. The settlement of harsh environments such as tundra regions, a decline in the hunting of large animals (as many were hunted to extinction), and the increased use of smaller packets of food, such as shellfish and seeds, all hint at gentle population pressure. So does the increasing number of habitation sites.49 But most important of all, we have seen already that humans had occupied all the earth’s habitable continents by the beginning of the Holocene era, thereby eliminating any easy opportunities for further extensification. Given the foraging technologies of the Paleolithic, human populations in much of the world were already pressing at the limits of the earth’s carrying capacity. Paul Bairoch observes, “According to the estimates of Hassan, the optimum carrying capacity of the world under hunting and gathering is some 8.6 million (5.6 million in tropical grasslands and only 0.5 million in temperate grasslands).”50

In particular regions, climatic change may have exaggerated these pressures, for as global temperatures rose, so did sea levels. In areas such as the Persian Gulf, this change undoubtedly forced coastal foragers to encroach on the territories of their neighbors. (One of the difficulties of testing this hypothesis is that most of the relevant sites are now under water.) The geography of Paleolithic migrations also highlights the existence of a few bottlenecks where population densities may have been exceptionally high. These were regions through which many peoples had to pass if they were to move to other lands. The region between Mesopotamia and the Nile was certainly such a region. By Paleolithic standards, it had relatively dense populations from as early as 80,000 or 90,000 years ago. Mesoamerica may constitute another such bottleneck, and so, probably, did the narrow stretch of habitable lands to the west of the Andes. It is harder to see whether such arguments can be applied to the Yellow or Yangtze valleys in China, but it may be that even there, localized abundance created bottlenecks that forced communities of foragers to live within ever smaller territories.

A third factor, closely linked to population growth, may also have encouraged sedentism: an increase in interregional exchanges. In foraging communities, the practice of gathering temporarily for the exchange of goods, rituals, and people in marriage has been widely documented. Foragers gathered where they could intensify food production, at least for a few weeks. Here is one description of such meetings, taken from the memoirs of a nineteenth-century British pastoralist in the Australian state of Victoria:



At the periodical great meetings trading is carried on by the exchange of articles peculiar to distant parts of the country. A favourite place of meeting for the purpose of barter is a hill called Noorat, near Terang. In that locality the forest kangaroos are plentiful, and the skins of the young ones found there are considered superior to all others for making rugs. The Aborigines from the Geelong district bring the best stones for making axes, and a kind of wattle gum celebrated for its adhesiveness. This Geelong gum is so useful in fixing the handles of stone axes and the splinters of flint in spears, and for cementing the joints of bark buckets, that it is carried in large lumps all over the Western District. Greenstone for axes is obtained also from a quarry on Spring Creek, near Goodwood; and sandstone for grinding them is got from the salt creek near Lake Boloke. Obsidian or volcanic glass, for scraping and polishing weapons, is found near Dunkeld… . Marine shells … and freshwater mussel shells, are also the articles of exchange.51





Andrew Sherratt has suggested that exchanges of valued goods between foraging communities may have encouraged dense and perhaps even long-term settlement at the hubs of regional networks of exchange. Such exchanges were particularly intense in the early Holocene along the Levantine corridor, between Anatolia and the Red Sea; they might have stimulated communities already exploiting natural stands of cereals on well-watered highlands to try encouraging their growth in lowland regions crossed by flourishing “trade” routes. Indeed, he points out that in the 1960s, Jane Jacobs argued that large settlements such as Jericho may have appeared first, at points where exchanges were most intense; simple forms of agriculture may have emerged to support already existing settlements, with small villages appearing later.52 Of course, the same exchanges would have also encouraged swapping of the ecological techniques needed for early types of farming.

In some regions, therefore, localized abundance, gentle population pressure, and increased exchanges may have conspired to encourage sedentism. Sedentary communities had appeared even during the Upper Paleolithic; but in the absence of domestication, these experiments led to no permanent or widespread changes in technologies or lifeways. However, at the end of the last ice age, the presence of more abundant potential domesticates, and perhaps of increasing population pressure, ensured that such experiments would prove more common, more significant, and more lasting. The Natufian cultures of the Middle East offer a good example of these processes.

Population Growth, Intensification, and Specialization Sedentism is not the same as agriculture, but it was probably a vital, unplanned step toward agriculture. In the Middle East, Natufian populations grew rapidly, and Natufian villages fissioned and spread throughout the eastern Levant after 14,000 BP. Population growth was almost certainly caused by sedentism, even if it was also, in some regions, a cause of sedentism. As the previous chapter showed, mobile communities of foragers have good reasons to limit population growth. But if they settle down, those limits to population growth can be relaxed. Babies do not need to be carried so much; grain-based diets (particularly if foods are cooked) make it possible to wean children earlier; birth intervals will shorten; and females will reach puberty earlier. All these factors would have accelerated population growth in less mobile communities.

Sedentism also tended to transform both the technologies of sedentary foragers and the genetic nature of the plants and animals on which they fed. Increased dependence on a small number of abundant and easily harvested food sources reduced people’s familiarity with the wide range of species and techniques they had used when more nomadic. This was a Neolithic form of “de-skilling.” But the same processes would also have increased specialized knowledge of particular favored species. Sedentary communities would have learned much more about the life cycles, diseases, and patterns of growth of the small number of species closest to their settlements. This lore would have added greatly to the already substantial ecological knowledge that foragers had of the life cycles of their prey species, and of how to protect and propagate them efficiently. The careful tending of these species would also have encouraged genetic changes that favored domestication, as poorer specimens were rejected. Finally, the clearance of land for permanent buildings would have created ideal conditions in which hardy species could thrive, particularly if humans used them regularly so that their seeds accumulated around human settlements.

Over time, sedentary communities of foragers would have found that their own numbers increased, that their knowledge of particular prey species increased, and that these same species began to change in ways that made them more and more useful.

The Trap of Sedentism As the populations of sedentary communities increased, and as they became more dependent on a narrowing range of favored species and more skilled at raising the productivity of these species, both the possibility and the desirability of returning to nomadic lifeways diminished. This is a pattern we can describe as the trap of sedentism. Within just a few generations, sedentary foraging communities may have found that they had become committed to a sedentary lifeway as they lost ancient skills, and as population growth reduced the territories available to each community. As a Neolithic Malthus could have predicted, eventually population growth was bound to outstrip the abundant natural resources that had encouraged sedentism in the first place. Alternatively, periods of local climatic deterioration may have reduced the amount of naturally occurring foodstuffs available. In either case, after a few generations of sedentism, communities would have found themselves pressing at the ecological limits of regions whose resources had seemed abundant when they had first settled down. At this point, if the option of returning to more nomadic lifeways was no longer available (because neighboring regions were also overpopulated) or no longer seemed attractive (because the sedentary lifestyle had begun to seem normal), communities had little choice but to intensify further, putting more effort into raising the productivity of a few favored species.

This decision constituted the final step to fully developed forms of agriculture. These processes are clearest of all in evidence from Mesopotamia. Natufian communities suffered as climates deteriorated between 13,000 and 11,500 BP. There are signs of growing nutritional deficiencies, of increased female infanticide, and of increasing differences of rank, all of which may be responses to resource crises.53 Some communities in the Fertile Crescent, particularly in more arid regions, responded by returning to more mobile lifeways. But in regions with abundant water supplies and surviving stands of wild cereals, some communities began to intensify production of particular foodstuffs, such as cereals. The crucial step was to plant seeds in soil cleared of other plants. Analogies with modern foraging societies and also with horticultural societies, in which women appear to do most of the agricultural work, suggest that it may have been women who pioneered these techniques, while men concentrated on hunting and other activities that took them away from their home villages.54 At first, deliberate cultivation may have been a purely defensive step designed to aid survival in deteriorating conditions, for after 13,000 BP Natufian population levels seem to have declined sharply. However, it clearly worked, for there soon appeared communities that depended more and more on the use of domesticated species, first of plants and then animals. Many communities continued to treat domestication as a limited supplement to traditional foraging lifeways—but some did not. For them, domestication provided the basis for an entirely new lifeway.

The first true agricultural villages appeared in Southwest Asia only after ca. 10,500 BP. The village of Abu Hureyra, near the border between modern Turkey and Syria, illustrates how rapid this transition could be.55 At about 10,500 BP a village was established here; its pit dwellings were made with reed roofs and wooden uprights. Their occupants used wild grains but also hunted gazelles. The gazelles would arrive regularly each spring, they were killed in large numbers, and their meat was stored. Thus these communities stored both meat and grains. They may have deliberately planted some grains, and perhaps they penned wild game such as gazelles. Agriculture and livestock herding then developed quite rapidly during several hundred years after ca. 10,500 BP. The population of the village grew to about 300 to 400 people. About 9,700 years ago, a new village appeared that covered a larger area; its inhabitants still depended on gazelle. But by ca. 9,000 years ago, in a rapid transition lasting perhaps only a century, they had become agriculturalists, with substantial herds of domesticated sheep and goats and with crops of cereals and pulses. They built simple rectangular houses from mud brick, with narrow lanes and courtyards.56 By this time, similar villages had appeared in many parts of the Fertile Crescent (see map 8.3).





A General Explanation for Agricultural Origins?




This sequence—preadaptation; then increased sedentism encouraged by climatic changes, gentle population pressure, and increased exchanges; then intensification and further population growth, leading finally to fully committed agriculture—fits the Fertile Crescent quite well. But does it apply to other regions of early agriculture?

It used to be thought that domestication preceded sedentism in the Americas. This may well be true, in the sense that nomadic or seminomadic communities may have played a crucial role in the early stages of the domestication of crops such as maize. But recent revisions of the date of domestication in the Americas suggest that here, too, sedentism may have been crucial to the emergence of forms of agriculture that could lead to more fundamental transformations. Chinese data are too scanty to offer firm conclusions, but the same sequence seems perfectly possible there as well, and the same is true of early agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa.57 In the best recent survey of the problem, Bruce Smith argues that





Map 8.3. Ancient Mesopotamia.





in many regions of the world, experiments leading to seed plant domestication and, eventually, agriculture were carried out in a common set of conditions. The experimenters were hunter-gatherer [forager] societies that had settled by lakes, marshes, or rivers—locales so rich in wild resources that these societies could establish permanent settlements and rely to a considerable extent on local plant and animal communities. Thus a sedentary way of life, supported by the plentiful resources of an aquatic zone, seems to have been an important element in early experiments with domestication.58





EARLY AGRARIAN LIFEWAYS




How did people live in the earliest agrarian communities? To answer this question we must break with the strict chronology of this chapter, because early agrarian era societies were not confined to the period between 11,500 and 4,000 BP. In some regions, such as the highlands of Papua New Guinea, they survived well into the twentieth century; in many regions, including much of the Americas, semisedentary communities survived until just a century or two ago.59 But the question is of great importance, as communities of independent farmers have been so widespread and have endured for so long that their lifeways and histories constitute an important though neglected chapter of human history.





Technologies: Horticulture, Not Agriculture




Technologies of the early agrarian era were different from those we associate with agriculture today. For this reason, it is common to refer to them as horticulture. By and large, these techniques were less productive than later technologies, and this may be one reason why the health of early agricultural communities was poorer in some respects than in most foraging communities. By horticulture, modern anthropologists mean technologies of plant cultivation that do not use plows or draft animals. In such societies, the main agricultural implement is little more than a sort of hoe or digging stick, used to plant seeds and to clear away weeds that might compete for nutrients from the soil.

Horticultural societies have survived in many regions of the world to the present day. Some regions and some crops may be better adapted to such technologies than to modern forms of plow agriculture, but horticulture is normally less productive. Digging sticks cannot turn over tough top soils, so horticulture can be practiced only in areas with fertile, easily worked soils, such as loesses. Besides, horticulturalists often do without the fertilizer provided by domestic animals. These limitations help explain why early forms of agriculture failed to spread into many regions that were farmed intensively in the later agrarian era. In areas such as modern Ukraine, early horticulturalists farmed lands on river terraces with loess soils, leaving upland regions between the rivers to nomadic foragers. Most early horticulturalists also continued to hunt and gather. Indeed, hunting, gathering, and fishing have remained important aspects of horticultural and agricultural lifeways to the present day.





Village Communities




The earliest agrarian era communities consisted of independent farming villages. Each constituted a largely self-sufficient society. Beyond them, there were no higher authorities, no states or regional chiefs, though networks of exchange (which were sometimes quite extensive) did exercise an impersonal influence on most communities.

Like villages of the Papua New Guinean highlands early in the twentieth century, early agrarian era villages varied greatly in size, from twenty to forty households up to several thousand. Some of these villages might have appeared to us as small towns. Permanent settlements appear to favor a different architecture from the temporary settlements of more mobile communities. Whereas communities of nomads tend to consist of circular “humpies” or windbreaks, the buildings in villages are made to last, and usually this means that they are square or rectangular. (However, in northern China, well-built round houses survived for a long time. Their remains can still be seen in the village of Pan-po outside Xian.) More permanent dwellings required a clarification of family arrangements, for they sharply pose the question, Who lives with whom? Thus, house sizes and designs suggest that the nuclear family may have acquired a sharper definition within these villages. There may also have emerged a clearer sense of “property,” both of the individual household and of the village as a whole (see figure 8.5). When defensive walls appear in some regions, toward the end of the early agrarian era, we can be sure that villagers have begun to acquire a strong sense of family and village property.

The groups who lived in early agrarian era villages were larger than the families and bands that dominate the Old Stone Age. Kinship certainly remained the main principle that organized these communities before the appearance of large-scale chiefdoms and states. However, the nature of kinship thinking must have changed to accommodate the larger, more tightly organized and more permanent communities of these farming villages. Nuclear families had to clarify their relations with each other and with the village as a whole, which meant creating more elaborate notions of kinship of a kind familiar to modern students of village societies. This is why it is reasonable to assume that the main social structures of the early agrarian era were similar to those that Elman Service has described as “tribes,” as opposed to the much simpler “bands,” which rarely included more than fifty people, and usually far fewer.60 Because tribes may contain hundreds of people, they need more elaborate ways of classifying the relationships between individuals and households. Often a sense of unity is maintained by assuming that everyone is descended from the same ancestor.

Hierarchies or Equality?




Though individuals in most nomadic foraging communities may be ranked clearly by gender and age, and there may well exist personal hierarchies besides, in most other respects foraging societies have to be egalitarian. As long as they are nomadic, they cannot create stored surpluses that could generate significant distinctions in wealth. Agriculture required regular storage of surpluses, and sustained much larger communities. It thereby created the preconditions for a concentration of wealth and the appearance of new forms of inequality. Indeed, there are signs that inequalities began to appear as soon as foragers became more sedentary. Early Natufian communities may have consisted simply of small numbers of related families. However, as Natufian communities grew in size, more complex relationships began to emerge as the problems of managing village activities and controlling village conflicts became more complicated. The main problem sedentary communities face is that individuals can no longer easily deal with conflicts by just moving on or joining other groups. Agriculture ties individuals and whole groups much more firmly to a particular piece of land, and it therefore forces them on occasion to act collectively. For this and other reasons, larger communities find it necessary, for some purposes, to choose leaders. And choosing leaders inevitably means some form of hierarchy. Even in some Natufian burials, archaeologists have detected differences between a minority of individuals buried with ornamental objects, who were presumably of higher status, and a majority buried less grandly. The fact that even children are sometimes buried in grander style suggests that high rank could be inherited, so there may have existed a system of ranked lineages.

Similar pressures operated in all early agricultural villages. Yet during the early agrarian era, there were limits to how far such inequalities could go. Particularly in regions where agriculture was new and there was little competition for resources, communities remained quite egalitarian. In the early stages of the Tripolye culture in Ukraine, for example, houses do not vary greatly in size, and the objects they contain do not suggest great variations in wealth. It is evidence of this kind that led the Lithuanian-born American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas to argue that the entire early agrarian era may have been a period of relative equality between men and women and between different families.61 There probably existed a clear division of labor by gender. In most farming communities, having children was essential for the survival of family units; and in worlds with high rates of infant mortality but without contraception or bottle-feeding, this meant that the lives of women were dominated by the bearing and rearing of children. But there is no reason to assume that such differences in gender roles necessarily implied systematic forms of gender inequality.





Relations with Other Societies




As we have seen, early agrarian era communities coexisted with foraging communities. They also traded with other agrarian communities. The large networks of exchange in the early Neolithic thus linked communities living in very different ways. The evidence for extensive systems of exchange is clearest from the Middle East—particularly from Anatolia, where the early town of Catal Hüyük traded in obsidian, a volcanic glass used for making sharp blades.

Undoubtedly these contacts included conflict and raiding, and early agrarian societies may have engaged in semiritualized struggles of various kinds in which there were occasional casualties (as there are in the modern ritualized conflicts we call “sports”). But it is unlikely that such conflicts were highly organized or regular enough to be regarded as warfare. Most early agrarian era communities do not have large caches of weapons. Nor do they have fortifications as a matter of course. Even in Jericho, the oldest-known farming village, the walls, which were once believed to have been fortifications, are now thought to have been an early form of flood control.





AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS




With the appearance of farming, there began a fundamental change in the relation between humans and the natural world. Already in the Paleolithic era, human activity affected other organisms. But when humans engaged in agriculture for the first time, they began to remake the nonliving environment as well—its soils, rivers, and landscapes—to create new environments tailored specifically to their own needs.62 Agriculture means altering natural processes in ways that benefit humans, so it means interfering in natural ecological cycles. By removing unwanted species (weeding), agriculturalists deliberately create artificial landscapes in which processes of succession, which might have returned the land to its previous state, are prevented. The land is deliberately kept free of many species, and therefore is maintained below its natural productivity level. In return, the productivity of those species favored by humans is increased, as they are given extra access to nutrients, water, and sunlight. But reducing plant cover also increases the rate of erosion, because plants hold soil together through their roots, create humus that binds soils together, and reduce the size and kinetic energy of raindrops as they hit the ground.63 And erosion, together with intense cultivation of a small number of crops, can accelerate nutrient cycles, forcing humans to start deliberately maintaining soil fertility, whether by adding manure or ashes, by rotating crops, or by letting the land recuperate in fallow periods. Humans also continued to remake the organisms around them, not just by genetic engineering of domestic crops and animals but also by hunting down animals (such as wolves) that threatened them or their domesticates.

As humans began to reshape their environments in ways that suited them better, they may have experienced a growing sense of separation between the “natural” and “human” worlds. The sense of community between humans and their environment, which is still apparent in modern foraging communities, probably diminished in agricultural communities. It would have been replaced by a sense of alienation—a sense that the natural world was at best indifferent to humans, and at worst positively hostile.

However, in the early Holocene era, these changes affected only small parts of the world, and early agrarian technologies had a limited effect on the natural environment.64 Only when agricultural techniques began to spread more widely did the human impact on the natural world become more significant.





SUMMARY




The end of the last ice age marks a fundamental turning point in human history. With the advent of agriculture, human societies began to acquire the demographic and technological dynamism that has driven historical change in recent millennia. Agriculture appeared in several different parts of the world in the millennia after the end of the last ice age. Explaining why communities of foragers took up agriculture is not easy, but the main steps seem reasonably clear. Most of the skills needed were already present in foraging societies. Present as well were a number of plant and animal species that were preadapted for domestication. Climatic changes spurred experimentation with new technologies and created new regions of abundance that encouraged sedentism, while sedentism, in its turn, encouraged local population growth. Eventually, as populations grew, sedentary communities had to either resume more traditional nomadic lifeways or intensify even further. Those that chose the second path created the first truly agricultural societies.

However, the advantages of early agricultural technologies were not so great that they spread rapidly or automatically. Instead, early agrarian era communities expanded slowly as migrants colonized those areas suitable for the era’s forms of horticulture. For many millennia, agrarian communities coexisted with neighboring populations of foragers. Most of the early agrarian era was therefore characterized by slow population growth (by modern standards), limited conflict, and limited ecological impacts. The early agrarian era was a relatively peaceful world of small village communities living among other communities that continued to practice foraging life-ways similar to those of the Upper Paleolithic. Historians have largely neglected this period of human history, so it is important to remember that it lasted as long as the subsequent era, which was dominated by the emergence of cities, states, and empires.
