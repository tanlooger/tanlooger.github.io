title: CHAPTER 5 THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE BIOSPHERE

DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY




Once life had appeared on Earth, natural selection ensured that living organisms would multiply and diversify as long as they could find new niches to fill in a changing world. This chapter will describe the main changes in the history of life on Earth. How did evolution generate the variety of organisms present today? What are the main stages in the history of life on Earth? Though many details of this story remain obscure, its broad outlines are now remarkably clear.

After almost 4 billion years of evolution, most living organisms are still simple and small. Bacteria rule, as they always did, and few bacteria are more than a hundredth of a millimeter in diameter. Unlike stars (whose complexity does not necessarily increase with size), living organisms seem to get more complex as they get larger. So the predominance of bacteria is in accordance with the general rule that simpler entities are easier to create and sustain than complex entities, as well as being more durable and more numerous. The vast majority of living organisms belong to what Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan have called the “microcosmos.”1 This is why Stephen Jay Gould has argued that even if the appearance of life marks the emergence of new forms of complexity, the history of life on Earth is not merely a story of entities becoming complex. The simplest genetic recipes still work well, so there is no particular evolutionary virtue in complexity.2 Indeed, in some cases organisms have evolved toward greater simplicity: snakes have lost their legs, moles have lost their eyes, and viruses have lost even the ability to reproduce independently.

Nevertheless, it is also true that natural selection has experimented endlessly with new ways of living, and in the course of this 4-billion-year-long experiment, it has given rise to organisms more complex than those living on the early earth. They have appeared even though there seems to be no active drive toward greater complexity, and even though complex organisms may not be terribly important in the overall scheme of things. As John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry point out, “The theory of evolution by natural selection does not predict that organisms will get more complex… . Yet some lineages have become more complex.”3 A world of “macrocosmic” organisms eventually appeared within and alongside the microcosmic world; as large organisms ourselves, we tend to pay attention to this process—just as our history of the universe has concentrated on one obscure planet orbiting one obscure star, simply because that planet happens to be our home.

The story of increasing biological complexity can be told as a series of major transitions. These include the origin of life itself, the appearance of eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction, the construction of multicellular organisms such as ourselves, and the appearance of organisms that join together in social groups.4 At each stage, molecules, cells, and individuals were linked together in larger structures—like businesses during corporate mergers—and evolution had to find new ways for them to communicate and cooperate with each other. Explaining how complexity arose through natural selection means explaining why it occasionally proved advantageous (in Darwinian terms) for replicating molecules to cooperate in larger and larger entities, until there appeared towering organisms like us—huge structures made up of billions of closely cooperating cells.

Despite our size (we are to a single-celled organism what the Empire State Building is to a human), we shouldn’t exaggerate our complexity. One familiar way of measuring increasing complexity is by estimating the number of genes it takes to construct different types of organisms. But this calculation, it appears, does not flatter us as much as we once thought. Humans do not have the 60,000 to 80,000 genes we once believed were necessary to construct us but half that number, about 30,000. Roundworms have two-thirds as many genes as us (ca. 19,000), and fruit flies just under half (ca. 13,000); even Escherichia coli, a bacterium that inhabits our gut, may have as many as 4,000 genes. So, though constructing large organisms is tougher than constructing small organisms, the difference is not as great as we once imagined. Our biological relatives include amoebae and roundworms as well as chimps.





THE ARCHEAN ERA: THE AGE OF BACTERIA




The most important evidence for the history of life on Earth comes from the fossil record, which tells us a great deal about the last 700 million years. But this is less than one-fifth of the period during which life has existed here. The fossil record can tell us less about earlier periods—during which living organisms consisted of single cells, all living in the sea—because these early organisms lacked hard parts that could form fossils. However, paleontologists have learned how to find and analyze the tiny “microfossils” of bacteria, and the oldest of these date back 3.5 billion years, close to the earliest signs of life on Earth. In recent years, biologists have also made increasing use of techniques for studying and comparing the genetic material of different modern species. This work can show evolutionary links between modern species that cannot be detected from the fossil record alone.

In the conventional planetary chronologies, the Hadean era is the era of Earth’s formation, and lasts until about 4 billion years ago; the Archean age is the earliest era of life on Earth, lasting from ca. 4 billion to ca. 2 to 2.5 billion years ago. The first life-forms on Earth evolved early in that age, and they did so in the presence of water. They may have been archaebacteria, which evolved in hot volcanic vents in or below the seabed. Or they may have been other forms of bacteria, if recent research is right in suggesting that both archaebacteria and eukaryotic organisms evolved from earlier and simpler organisms, the so-called eubacteria.5

Either way, life appeared early. Living organisms probably existed by 3.8 billion years ago, for rocks of this age from Greenland contain a level of the C12 isotope that is normally associated with the presence of life. Life was certainly present by 3.5 billion years ago, the date of rocks from South Africa and Western Australia that seem to contain microfossils of bacteria similar to modern cyanobacteria (i.e., blue-green algae).6 These were similar to the organisms that turn stagnant water green today. Their presence suggests that the seas of the early earth were then already full of life. The speed with which life appeared on Earth has encouraged many biologists to think that given appropriate conditions anywhere in the universe, life may appear rapidly and naturally. So life, far from being rare, may exist throughout the universe. As Paul Davies has recently argued, the universe itself, at least in the current phase of its evolution, seems to be a “bio-friendly” place.7

But that “friendliness” has its limits. Any complex structure requires a constant flow of energy if it is to survive. So one of the fundamental tasks for all organisms is to find sources of nutrients and energy—a task that is not always easy. The solutions found by the earliest organisms on Earth had a profound effect on the history of life here and also shaped the planet itself.

The earliest organisms may have extracted their energy from chemicals below the earth’s surface. They “ate” chemicals. If the earliest organisms were archaebacteria, they probably extracted the energy they needed from chemical vents deep within the seas. But quite early some organisms learned to acquire energy by eating other organisms. In this way, there emerged a clear distinction between primary producers, which extract their energy from the nonliving environment, and organisms higher up the food chain that feed on other living organisms, including the primary producers. If these had been the only ways of extracting energy, then the history of life on Earth would have been limited by the energy supplied from the earth’s molten core and available to organisms living deep within the sea. But by at least 3.5 billion years ago, some organisms were living near the surface of the seas, where they learned to feed on sunlight. And the Sun is a richer source of energy than the heat engine at the center of the earth. The cells of cyanobacteria contained molecules of chlorophyll, which enabled them to process sunlight in the fundamental chemical reaction known as photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is so important for life on earth that it is worth making the effort to understand how it works.8 Molecules consist of atoms linked together by chemical bonds. However, creating chemical bonds requires energy, and some of that energy can be released by breaking the bonds again. So chemicals can be thought of as stores of energy. Living organisms get at the energy stored in organic molecules such as glucose by breaking their chemical bonds. As it also takes energy to break chemical bonds, the trick is to do it in such a way that more energy is released than is used to break the bond. This is the work of enzymes. Enzymes are molecules (mainly proteins) whose shape enables them to destabilize particular energy-containing molecules with very little effort. By doing so, they release much more energy than they expend. The principle of using a small amount of energy to release a much larger amount is one we are all familiar with—we do it whenever we use a match to light a fire. However, this whole process requires an initial input of energy to create the chemical bonds that act as stores of energy. This is where photosynthesis comes in. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll (in the presence of water and carbon dioxide) uses the energy of light to set up a tiny electric current. This current drives a complex chain of reactions that form molecules of substances such as glucose that can store energy. In this way, plants use the energy of sunlight to create tiny energy packages in their own bodies, which they unwrap when they need more energy. Of course, other organisms can also use the stored energy by eating plants. When we eat an apple, we are breaking into and using the energy stored by the apple tree. When we burn coal, we are releasing energy stored by trees of the Carboniferous era, 300 million years ago. In this way, large amounts of energy derived from sunlight can be stored in quite small packages. It is easy to forget that a cup of gasoline, which contains the energy stored by organisms many millions of years ago, can drive a truck up a hill. It is also easy to forget that without the constant inflow of energy from sunlight, the whole biosphere would run out of energy.

Using the complex chemical reactions of photosynthesis, living organisms began to harvest the colossal bounty of sunlight. Fueled by sunlight, life could flourish in ways that would have been unthinkable in a sunless world. Much of the rest of the history of life on Earth is governed by the different ways in which sunlight was captured, distributed, and divided among the different species that shared the planet. Human history is part of this story, for humans have found increasingly powerful ways of harvesting sunlight, through foraging, farming, and the use of fossil fuels.

Cyanobacteria are the remote ancestors of modern plants, and they are among the most important primary producers in the world today. Many cyanobacteria secrete a sticky slime, which enables them to stick together in mats. Over time, these form large, mushroom-shaped objects called stromatolites, with a thin upper layer of living bacteria atop a thickening layer of their congealed ancestors. Stromatolites still form in a few environments today (one of the most famous such places is Shark Bay in Western Australia), but fossil stromatolites are common from as early as 3 billion years ago. They are a reminder that many of the earliest life-forms were so successful that they still survive today, with remarkably little obvious change.

So we should resist the temptation to think that the Archean world was boring in comparison with ours. Properly understood, this world was as varied and exotic as our own. Margulis and Sagan offer a dramatic description:



Shrunk to microscopic perspective, a fantastic landscape of bobbing purple, aquamarine, red, and yellow spheres would come into view. Inside the violet spheres of Thiocapsa, suspended yellow globules of sulfur would emit bubbles of skunky gas. Colonies of ensheathed viscous organisms would stretch to the horizon. One end stuck to rocks, the other ends of some bacteria would insinuate themselves inside tiny cracks and begin to penetrate the rock itself. Long skinny filaments would leave the pack of their brethren, gliding by slowly, searching for a better place in the sun. Squiggling bacterial whips shaped like corkscrews or fusili pasta would dart by. Multicellular filaments and tacky textilelike crowds of bacterial cells would wave with the currents, coating pebbles with brilliant shades of red, pink, yellow, and green. Showers of spores, blown by breezes, would splash and crash against the vast frontier of low-lying muds and waters.9





In the microcosmos, genetic information can float around in the form of bits and pieces of DNA or RNA known variously as replicons, plasmids, phages, or viruses. These objects exist right at the borderline between life and nonlife, for most consist of little more than genetic information looking for a body to do their “living” for them. Bacteria can make use of these fragments of genetic information at any stage of their life, not just at reproduction. And they do so to supplement the limited range of metabolic skills available in their small genetic libraries.10 Replicons may never become incorporated into the permanent genetic store of each bacterium, but, like borrowed software, they can be used by their host before moving on elsewhere. So bacteria can share genetic information with a flexibility not available to larger organisms, a feature that may help explain their astonishing variety and adaptability. Despite its tiny genetic library, each bacterium has access to a global genetic data bank that is off-limits to larger organisms such as us (or was off-limits, before the era of genetic engineering). As Margulis and Sagan put it: “For the macrocosmic size, energy, and complex bodies we enjoy, we trade genetic flexibility.”11 We will see later that symbolic language may have returned, at least to our species, some of the adaptive flexibility that bacteria enjoy through their ability to freely swap genetic material, by permitting us to swap information instead of genes.

By many measures, bacteria remain the dominant forms of life on earth today. Eventually, though, some single-celled organisms began to join together in more tightly organized structures. These constitute the first steps toward the creation of multicellular organisms such as ourselves. The beginnings of multicellularity occurred during the Proterozoic era.





THE PROTEROZOIC ERA: NEW FORMS OF COMPLEXITY




Early forms of photosynthesis pried hydrogen loose from hydrogen sulfide to store the energy of sunlight. Eventually, though, some forms of cyanobacteria learned to pry hydrogen loose from the much tougher bonds of water molecules in a more efficient form of photosynthesis, one of whose by-products was free oxygen. Over millions of years, this new, and more powerful, metabolic technology began to transform the early atmosphere by pumping into it huge amounts of free oxygen, a gas that was poison to most early life-forms.

At first, free oxygen was quickly reabsorbed in chemical reactions, such as rusting, that bound it to iron. (The presence of huge bands of rust from the early Proterozoic era is one of the reasons we know about the increase in free oxygen.) However, from about 2.5 billion years ago on, free oxygen was being produced too fast to be soaked up in this way, and it began to appear in the atmosphere. By 2 billion years ago, free oxygen may have accounted for 3 percent of the gases in the atmosphere; in the last billion years, the level has risen to about 21 percent.12 If there were much more oxygen around, we’d self-ignite if we rubbed our hands together too hard!

The appearance of an oxygen-rich atmosphere was one of the greatest of all revolutions in the history of life on earth. Margulis and Sagan describe the change as “the oxygen holocaust.”13 Because oxygen is so reactive, its presence kept the atmosphere in a continuous chemical imbalance, creating a new level of chemical tension that could drive more powerful forms of evolutionary change. Here, fueled indirectly by the Sun, was a new source of free energy that could be used to construct more complex life-forms. As James Lovelock has written: “[Free oxygen] provides the chemical potential difference wide enough for birds to fly and for us to run and keep warm in winter; perhaps also to think. The present level of oxygen tension is to the contemporary biosphere what the high-voltage electricity supply is to our twentieth-century way of life. Things can go on without it, but the potentialities are substantially reduced.”14

The life-forms that dominated the earth until less than 2 billion years ago were simple, single-celled organisms that lived in the sea. Biologists call such organisms prokaryotes. The DNA of prokaryotes floats freely within the cell. At reproduction, the cell splits, and each half receives an identical copy of the DNA of the parent cell. Thus, in prokaryotic organisms the offspring are normally clones of the parents. However, as we have seen, they can exchange genetic information “horizontally” with their neighbors, as well as “vertically” with their parents and offspring, an ability that allows for types of evolution not available to more complex organisms.15 This partly explains why prokaryotes were so successful in discovering and exploiting many of the basic chemical processes on which life depends even today. They altered the earth’s surface as well as its atmosphere; in the words of Margulis and Sagan, “The Age of Bacteria transformed the earth from a cratered moonlike terrain of volcanic glassy rocks into the fertile planet in which we make our home.”16

However, until living organisms had access to the powerful batteries of an oxygen-rich atmosphere, there was a limit to their complexity and size. Free oxygen is extremely damaging to simple organic materials, which is why life could not have appeared in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. But after 2 billion years of evolution, life was robust and flexible enough to survive the appearance of this new pollutant. Though many species must have perished, those that managed to survive in an oxygen-rich atmosphere would have flourished, because oxygen can supply much more energy than most other forms of “food.” In addition, free oxygen, floating high in the atmosphere, eventually created the ozone layer. Though only a few millimeters thick and about 30 kilometers above the earth’s surface, this layer of three-atom oxygen molecules (O3) shielded the earth from much ultraviolet radiation and thus made it easier for life to spread on land as well as in the sea. In these ways, the appearance of oxygen steered evolution into new pathways.

These changes may explain the appearance of distinctively new life-forms, known as eukaryotes, about 1.7 billion years ago.17 Their arrival marks a clear increase in the genetic complexity of organisms, so it counts as one of the major transitions in the history of life on earth.18 While most prokaryotes are tiny, somewhere between 1 and 10 thousandths of a millimeter in size, eukaryotic cells are normally much larger. Most are between 10 and 100 thousandths of a millimeter across, which means that the largest can just be seen with the naked eye. They are also more complicated and contain much more (roughly 1,000 times more) DNA than most prokaryotes, though much of this extra genetic information seems not to be used. Finally, eukaryotes thrived in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, because they found ways of exploiting this new energy source. On a paleontological timescale, their appearance is also quite sudden. Margulis and Sagan cite the analogy of the astronomer Chet Raymo: “The difference between the new cells and the old prokaryotes in the fossil record looks as drastic as if the Wright Brothers’ Kitty Hawk flying machine had been followed a week later by the Concorde jet”19 (see figure 5.1).

Because eukaryotes contain so much more genetic information than prokaryotes, and have access to more powerful energy sources, they have more metabolic tricks up their sleeve and can give rise to more complex organisms. By extracting energy from oxygen, eukaryotes were indirectly exploiting the efforts of photosynthesizing organisms such as cyanobacteria, which were constantly pumping fresh oxygen into the atmosphere. Eukaryotes have more flexible and adaptable membranes than prokaryotes, and these allow them to exchange energy, foods, and wastes with their environment with more precision. Eukryotes also protect their delicate genetic machinery in a special internal compartment known as a nucleus. Finally, their insides are more complex, for they contain internal organs, or organelles.

Lynn Margulis has shown that eukaryotes probably evolved through the joining together of different types of prokaryotes and their genetic material in a form of symbiosis—the process by which independent organisms evolve so as to become more dependent on each other. Symbiosis is extremely common, and it illustrates one of the most complex aspects of evolutionary change: the fact that competition and cooperation are so closely intertwined. In evolution, as in commerce, not all games let the winner take all. Often, the winning move for a particular organism requires cooperating with other organisms. Biologists identify several different kinds of symbiosis. Parasitism is a relationship in which one species benefits at the expense of another. Cuckoos laying eggs in the nests of other birds are acting like parasites. But parasitism is not predation (in which the victim loses everything). If the relationship is to endure and benefit the parasite, the host must be kept alive, at least for a time; otherwise, the parasite gains little. In the relationship known as commensalism, two species live together and one benefits while the other seems to suffer no harm. Mutualism is a relationship in which both species seem to benefit from the partnership. Most flowering plants depend on insects or birds for pollination, but to attract their pollinators they “offer” nectar or food of some kind. Human agriculture involves a form of mutualism between humans and domesticated species of animals and plants. For example, humans eat maize (the cereal commonly known in North America as corn), and in some regions they will starve if the crop fails. But maize benefits from this relationship, because humans protect their plants, helping them to reproduce and flourish. Indeed, so dependent are modern strains of maize on this relationship that they can no longer reproduce without the help of humans. This is true symbiosis: a relationship in which one or both partners can no longer survive outside of the symbiotic relationship. Such relationships are surprisingly common in the animal world because where both partners gain something, the relationship may prove more stable than if one partner is gaining very little. This is why virulent disease bacteria so often evolve in ways that do less and less harm to their “hosts.” The most familiar examples for humans are “childhood” diseases such as chicken pox, which have all evolved from more virulent species that did so much damage to their hosts that they sometimes killed them off.





Figure 5.1. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells compared. Eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex than prokaryotic cells. In all cells, ribosomes assemble proteins, using instructions from the DNA. Flagella, which allow movement, are present in many (but not all) cells. But eukaryotic cells also contain other structures (or organelles) that are not present in Prokaryota. Eukaryota keep their DNA in a special area (the nucleus), where it is protected by a special membrane, and often organized into special parcels called chromosomes. They also have mitochondria, which convert food into chemical energy; and many have chloroplasts, which convert light into chemical energy in the process known as photosynthesis. Finally, Eukaryota also have a cytoskeleton, a complex structure made up of protein rods and tubes, that organizes the different organelles within the cell.

In extreme cases, mutualism may lead to the creation of a single organism from two species that had been independent. In a sense, eukaryotes are therefore the first “multicelled” organisms. With the appearance of eukaryotes, as Margulis and Sagan note, “Life had moved another step, beyond the networking of free genetic transfer to the synergy of symbiosis. Separate organisms blended together, creating new wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts.”20 We know this step was taken, because the internal organelles of eukaryotes seem to have developed from once-independent prokaryotic organisms that may originally have acted like parasites. Eukaryotic organelles include thousands of tiny ribosomes, in which different proteins are manufactured according to recipes contained in the DNA. They also include mitochondria, which specialize in extracting energy from oxygen in chemicals “eaten” by the cell, and lysosomes, which destroy harmful intruders. The whiplike flagella, which are present in most eukaryotes, allow them to move; thus eukaroytes, unlike prokaryotes, can move to congenial environments rather than just surviving wherever they drift. Presumably, motion revolutionized many evolutionary processes: “As the steam engine sped up the cycles of industrial production, including the manufacture of more steam engines, spirochete partnerships may have initiated a burst of development, increasing the number and diversity of symbiotic life forms.”21 Eukaryotic photosynthesizers also contain chloroplasts, or packets of chlorophyll. Indeed, the earliest eukaryotic organisms were probably green algae. The fact that some of these organelles, including mitochondria and chloroplasts, still contain their own DNA (mitochondria contain about a dozen genes) is one of the reasons for thinking that eukaryotes evolved through the symbiotic union of once-distinct organisms.

Eukaryotes reproduce in more complex ways than do prokaryotes. While most prokaryotes produce identical copies of themselves, eukaryotes normally reproduce only after merging the genetic material between two different parent individuals. The DNA from two adults merges randomly to produce new strands of DNA, which contain a mix of the genes of both parents. As a result, individuals vary more among eukaryotes than among prokaryotes. They are no longer clones of their parents. This innovation, the first step toward sexual reproduction, had a profound impact on the pace of evolutionary change, for it gave natural selection a greater variety of bodies to choose from in each generation. The evolutionary acceleration triggered by the emergence of eukaryotic organisms and of sexual reproduction explains why, in the last billion years, life has flourished in entirely new ways, creating the profusion of large life-forms that inhabit the modern earth. Sexual reproduction counts, along with the appearance of eukaryotic organisms, as one of the major turning points in the history of life on earth.22





THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION: FROM THE MICROCOSM TO THE MACROCOSM




The evolution of eukaryotic cells was part of a suite of evolutionary changes that were as significant as any since the first emergence of life on earth.

Sexual reproduction accelerated evolutionary change. Increasing amounts of free oxygen and the evolution of breathing (i.e., the ability to extract energy from oxygen) made more energy available for more exotic and powerful forms of metabolism. And, perhaps most important of all, eukaryotic organisms began to combine into teams that eventually formed the first multicellular organisms. Taken together, these changes help explain the “Cambrian explosion”—the relatively sudden proliferation of larger, more complex, and more energetic life-forms that began almost 600 million years ago.

The first multicellular organisms (as opposed to mere colonies of organisms, such as stromatolites) may have evolved as early as 2 billion years ago.23 But they became common only in the last billion years. Before such organisms could flourish, there were some serious problems to overcome. Most important of all, large numbers of cells had to be able to communicate and cooperate with each other in new ways.

This was not easy. To understand how it happened, it is important to distinguish between different types of biological cooperation. The first is symbiosis, which we have already encountered. A second type of cooperation arises from the formation of societies or colonies made up of many individuals of the same species. Sometimes these animal societies are held together quite loosely. We know that early organisms, including cyanobacteria, gathered in huge colonies, for stromatolites are formed from such colonies. However, though they gave protection to individuals, these colonies are not yet examples of symbiosis, as the individual organisms can still survive on their own when necessary. Some modern sponges appear to be single organisms, but in fact they can be passed through a sieve. They will break into a pulp, then reconstitute themselves as the individual cells regather. Equally extraordinary is a type of amoeba that feeds on bacteria. Joël de Rosnay explains:



If you deprive it of food and water, it emits a distress hormone. Other amoebas rush to the rescue and gather into a colony about a thousand strong—a thousand “individuals,” as it were, moving like a slug in search of nourishment. If they don’t find it, they stop moving, put up a spore-producing stalk, and remain there indefinitely, just like that, as long as it’s dry. But if you add water, the spores germinate and give rise to independent myxamoebas, which head off in different directions.24





Such entities consist, essentially, of millions of separate individuals huddling together in a sort of crowd, capable if necessary of working together in a team.

In so-called social animals, such as ants or termites, the dependence between individuals is greater. In ant or termite colonies, many individuals are sterile. Cooperation of this kind poses a serious problem to evolutionary theory, for what evolutionary advantage could there be for an organism that has no offspring? Why would genes evolve that seem to commit suicide in this way? The solution seems to be that natural selection works in such communities as long as the cooperating organisms are closely related. Genes that encourage an individual organism to enhance the reproductive chances of close relatives can indirectly enhance their own survival chances. For example, a sterile worker ant may share 50 percent of its genetic material with other ants in the colony that can reproduce. By helping them to reproduce, it is encouraging the survival of many of its own genes. Indeed, it can be shown mathematically that in certain situations the survival of particular genes may be maximized not just by having lots of offspring but also by helping relatives to have lots of offspring. But those relatives must be close. (The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane once commented that he would lay down his life for two brothers or eight cousins; he was referring to the fact that he shared half his genetic material with his brothers, but only one-eighth with his cousins.)25 Only through arguments of this kind is it possible to show how Darwinian mechanisms of natural selection can give rise to individuals that cooperate with other members of their species, even if doing so reduces their immediate reproductive chances.

Multicellular organisms are an extreme example of this type of cooperation. Organisms such as ourselves consist of hundreds of billions of individual cells, yet only a tiny number, the so-called germ cells, have any chance of reproducing. Why do the bone, blood, and liver cells put up with this? The answer seems to be that all the cells contain the same genetic material. They are clones, so they have identical DNA molecules. By cooperating, they maximize the survival chances of their shared genetic blueprint. In genetic terms, they have a common “interest” in ensuring the survival and reproduction of the entire organism, and therefore of the tiny number of germ cells. In such organisms, billions of individual cells cooperate so closely that we no longer think of them as separate organisms, but consider them to be parts of a single, complex, multicellular organism.

So, before multicellular organisms could evolve, there had to exist a mechanism that allowed a single germ cell (a fertile egg) to multiply into many different kinds of genetically identical cells in the adult form. What happens is that each cell inherits the same genetic material; but as the organism develops, external factors switch on different genes in different cells, leading different cells to develop differently. Once set, these genetic switches can then be passed on to further cells, so that a single brain cell may multiply by cloning many identical daughter cells.26 In the same way, muscle cells produce more muscle cells, bone cells produce more bone cells, and so on. This secondary form of heredity, by which only some of the total genome contained in the DNA is expressed in each cell, is characteristic of the way cells develop in all multicellular organisms.

The first extensive fossil evidence of multicellular organisms dates from the Ediacaran era, ca. 590 million years ago. But the fossil record of multicellular organisms really becomes abundant during the Cambrian era, from ca. 570 million years ago. Quite suddenly, in geological terms, there appeared organisms with protective shells, made from secretions of calcium carbonate. Their shells have survived exceptionally well as fossils. The worldwide appearance of shells marks the beginning of the Cambrian era, but it is hard to tell whether this signals a real flourishing of multicellular organisms or merely the appearance of organisms more likely to be preserved as fossils.

The largest multicellular organisms, such as trees or humans, may contain as many as 100 billion cells—as many cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. Humans have as many as 250 or more distinct types of cells, which are created and controlled by the activity of about 30,000 genes. At the other extreme are simpler multicellular organisms, such as fruit flies, which have only about sixty different types of cell. The hydra, an invertebrate that consists of little more than a translucent tube about 30 millimeters long, has only sixty different types of cell.27 Clearly, the evolution of multicellularity implied a significant increase in the complexity of living organisms. (As always, we must be careful not to assume that “more complex” means “better.”)

Few multicellular species survive in the fossil record for more than a few million years. As a result, the multicellular species that exist today are a tiny proportion of the many different species that have evolved in the past 600 million years. However, some of the larger types of species that have evolved since the Cambrian explosion have proved remarkably durable. It is as if there emerged standard general patterns, on which evolution kept weaving minor variations.

To understand the history of these different types of multicellular organisms, we need a system of classification, a taxonomy. Biologists classify species into many different groups and subgroups. The smallest unit of classification is a species. A single species consists of individual organisms that are so similar biologically that they can, in principle, interbreed with each other, but not with members of other species. Modern humans constitute a single species. According to one well-known definition, a species consists of “groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.”28 Similar species are grouped together in genera, related genera are grouped into families and superfamilies, and these, in turn, are classified within orders, classes, phyla, and, finally, kingdoms and even superkingdoms.

Currently, biologists differ about the best ways of classifying organisms at the highest levels. Linnaeus, the pioneer of modern systems of classification, grouped all organisms into two large systems: plants and animals. However, as they made more use of microscopes, biologists became aware of a vast array of single-celled organisms that did not fit into these two categories. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel suggested that all single-celled organisms be classified within a separate kingdom of Protista. Then, in the 1930s, biologists realized that there was a fundamental difference between cells with nuclei and those without. As a result, they began to divide all organisms into two distinct kingdoms, the Prokaryota (organisms whose cells had no nuclei) and the Eukaroyta (organisms whose cells had nuclei). In some systems, the Eukaryota also include all multicellular organisms. In the second half of the twentieth century, powerful arguments emerged for the creation of separate kingdoms for fungi and for viruses (which are so simplified that they cannot even reproduce without hijacking the metabolic systems of other organisms). In the 1990s, Carl Woese proposed a new large classification to distinguish between the archaea and other forms of bacteria. Like all prokaryotes, archaea do not have nuclei; but unlike other prokaryotes they take in energy neither from sunlight nor from oxygen but from other chemicals.

Table 5.1 describes one contemporary system of classification at the highest levels. This recognizes two superkingdoms, the Prokaryota and Eukaryota. Within these, it recognizes five kingdoms: Monera (the only kingdom within the Prokaryota), Protista (single-celled eukaryotic organisms), and Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia (all multicelled Eukaryota). Using this system, we can say, for example, that modern humans belong to the super kingdom of Eukaryota; to the kingdom of animals (Animalia); to the phylum Chordata, or backboned animals; to the class of mammals, or Mammalia; to the order of primates; to the superfamily Hominoidea (which includes humans and apes); to the family Hominidae (which includes humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees); to the subfamily Homininae (which includes humans and their ancestors of the last 4 or 5 million years); to the genus Homo; and to the species sapiens.29

Multicellular organisms divided quite quickly into three great kingdoms: plants (organisms that derive their energy from photosynthesis), animals (organisms that consume other organisms), and fungi (organisms that digest other organisms externally before absorbing nutrients from them). In the Ediacaran era, from ca. 590 to 570 million years ago, an astonishing range of multicellular organisms appear, some quite similar to organisms such as sponges, sea worms, corals, and mollusks that still exist today. But some species were quite different from anything that exists today. This is also true of many Cambrian organisms such as those excavated in the “Burgess shale” in British Columbia, which date from ca. 520 million years ago. This was clearly a period of genetic experimentation. From it there emerged, through adaptation or perhaps (as Stephen Jay Gould has argued) more through the sheer exuberance of evolutionary change, a number of basic patterns for the organization of multicellular plants and animals.30 Many of these patterns have survived to the present day.

The discovery of fossil spores from the Ordovician era (510–440 million years ago) suggests that plants were the first multicelled organisms to leave the sea and colonize the dry land. For multicelled organisms, colonizing the land was like settling another planet. Above all, the process required special protective equipment to prevent the organism from drying out and collapsing. The wet insides had to be protected by an insulating layer of some kind; indeed, all land animals still carry small surrogate seas within themselves, and it is there that their young are fertilized and begin to grow. Once on land, and without the buoyancy of water, bodies also needed more internal rigidity, a problem most often solved by using calcium compounds secreted from their cells to make skeletons. Special ways of feeding, breathing, and reproducing had to be developed as well. The land was, as Margulis and Sagan succinctly describe it, a hellish environment “of torturous sun, biting wind, and decreased buoyancy.”31 The earliest dry land colonizers were similar to modern liverworts or ferns. The first seed-bearing trees appeared during the Devonian period (410–360 million years ago). These formed huge forests from which most modern reserves of coal are derived. (Coal, like oil and natural gas, the other major “fossil fuels,” is literally formed from the fossilized remains of once-living organisms.)

Animals have taken multicellularity further than have plants. Their cells are more specialized, and communicate with each other more efficiently. Animals have also made a specialty of mobility and complex behavior. But this is not necessarily a cause for pride; rather, it is a sign of the all-pervasiveness of symbiotic relations in evolution, for plants don’t just feed animals but also exploit the mobility of animals to spread their own seeds. They don’t need brains or legs—they use ours!32 The first animals to move on land were probably arthropods, a bit like giant insects. We know of their presence from the Silurian period (440–410 million years ago). They included creatures similar to modern scorpions but as large as human beings. Arthropods, such as modern lobsters, carry their skeletons on the outside. In contrast, vertebrates, the group of animals that includes modern human beings, all have internal skeletons. The earliest vertebrates evolved in the sea, during the Ordovician period, between 510 and 440 million years ago, from wormlike ancestors. They included early forms of fish and sharks. All vertebrates had a backbone, limbs, and a nervous system whose parts were concentrated at one end, the head. This thicket of nerves at the end of the backbone was the first brain. Eventually it was to become the seat of consciousness, for at some point in the evolution of vertebrate brains (we do not know when), there appeared the capacity not just to react to stimuli but also to feel them, to be in some sense aware of them.

With the appearance of the earliest nervous systems, we can perhaps claim that simple forms of “consciousness” had evolved, if we accept Nicholas Humphrey’s argument that consciousness is the capacity to feel sensations, even where there is no systematic thought or self-awareness. “To be conscious is essentially to have sensations: that is, to have affect-laden mental representations of something happening here and now to me.”33 But consciousness clearly has degrees or grades, and these depend on how the brain represents and experiences the external world. Terrence Deacon has suggested that the experiences Humphrey refers to here should really be described as sentience, while the word consciousness should be applied to the way in which organisms “represent aspects of the world to themselves.”34 He argues that all creatures with nervous systems can construct internal representations of the external world that allow them to react in more complex ways to external changes. Thus, a bear will come to feel that there are similarities between all animals that look like bears. It may also learn to feel a close correlation between the onset of winter and a desire to hibernate. These felt representations of the external world may exist in all animals with nervous systems, though their diversity, the number of links between them, and the power of the sensations associated with them may increase in larger-brained species. But Deacon further argues that only humans can think in symbols—that is, in purely arbitrary signs that link together many different types of representation and can create a quite distinct internal world of their own.35 So, it seems likely that the inner world of humans shares much with that of the earliest organisms with brains, even if the glare of our symbolic thinking normally casts a mental shadow over these more direct and universal forms of sensation. The sensations that lurk in the background of our consciousness are probably shared with all organisms that are “aware” in this minimalist sense.

Though the earliest forms of consciousness evolved in the sea, consciousness was to flourish most spectacularly on land. Vertebrates (animals with backbones) first colonized the land in the late Devonian period, though the earliest steps on land may have taken place in the Silurian. Modern land vertebrates are still quite similar in their basic layout. All have four limbs, each with five digits even when, as in snakes, the limbs and digits have almost shriveled away. Such similarities suggest that all of them—amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals—are descended from the earliest colonizers of the land. The first amphibians evolved from fish that could breathe oxygen and whose fins could be used to move on land, like modern lungfish. However, amphibians have to lay their eggs in water, which normally confines them to seashores, rivers, or ponds. Reptiles evolved eggs with hard shells, just as trees evolved seeds with tough skins, so both types of organism can reproduce on dry land. The earliest reptiles appeared about 320 million years ago, during the Carboniferous era (360–290 million years ago). But evidence is growing that they began to flourish after the “great dying,” the massive extinctions of ca. 250 million years ago (at the end of the Permian period), which were perhaps caused, like the later Cretaceous extinctions, by a huge asteroid impact.36 To modern humans, the most spectacular of the ancient reptiles were the dinosaurs. These first appeared during the Triassic period (250–210 million years ago) and flourished until the end of the Cretaceous period, ca. 65 million years ago.37

Modern evidence suggests that the many different species of dinosaurs died out quite suddenly after an asteroid collided with the earth, creating a huge dust cloud.38 The Cretaceous impact may have created the 200-kilometer-wide Chixculub crater in the north of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. For many months, temperatures on the earth’s surface would have dropped as the Sun’s light was obscured. But then, as layers of dust insulated the earth, creating a sort of greenhouse effect, temperatures would have risen once more. These wild temperature fluctuations were enough to wipe out many species of warm-adapted creatures. Modern birds, with their insulating layer of feathers, may be descendants of the few species of dinosaurs that survived the catastrophe of the late Cretaceous period.





MAMMALS AND PRIMATES




Unlike reptiles, mammals are warm-blooded and furry. Their young are nourished before birth inside the bodies of females and after birth from modified sweat glands that produce milk (see timeline 5.2).

Mammals first appeared during the Triassic, at about the same time as the earliest dinosaurs. However, they remained limited in variety, number, and size during the era of the dinosaurs. Typically, mammals were small night creatures—similar in size, perhaps, to modern shrews. Their small bodies, and the fact that many lived in underground burrows, may have helped them survive the catastrophe that wiped out so many types of dinosaurs. After the disappearance of most dinosaurs, mammals flourished in a spectacular radiation of new species. They soon filled the many ecological niches vacated by dinosaurs. Mammal browsers appeared, alongside mammal carnivores, mammal insect eaters, and mammal tree dwellers. The asteroid impact of the late Cretaceous period counts, therefore, as a crucial event in the prehistory of our own species. If the asteroid had been on a slightly different trajectory, say a few minutes faster or slower, mammals would have remained limited in numbers and variety, and our own species could not possibly have evolved.

The crisis of the late Cretaceous is a reminder of the capriciousness and open-endedness of evolutionary change. Evolution has no preplanned direction. There was no inner necessity about the way in which life evolved on Earth. It may have been likely that photosynthesizing organisms would develop, or that, eventually, multicellular organisms would evolve.39 In this limited sense, it was likely that larger and more complex organisms would at some point appear. But there was no necessity about evolution taking the particular pathways it took on Earth.

Humans belong to the group of mammals known as primates. Today, the primates include about 200 species of monkeys, lemurs, and apes. Most have been tree dwellers. This particular niche encouraged the evolution of limbs with opposable thumbs (that could grasp); of eyes that could see stereoscopically, in order to judge distances accurately; and of brains that could control the complex movements of limbs and process the complex information from eyes. The earliest primates appeared soon after the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the group rapidly diversified, unconscious beneficiaries of the fluky crash landing at Chixculub.





Timeline 5.2. The scale of mammalian radiations: 70 million years.





Humans belong to the superfamily of primates known as the Hominoidea (hominoids). This includes human beings and the apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons, and orangutans) among living creatures, as well as many extinct species. The fossil record suggests that the earliest hominoids appeared roughly 25 million years ago in Africa. That our evolutionary ancestors had lived in Africa is an idea that even Darwin held, though he had far less evidence than we have today. His reasoning was simple: in the modern world, the animals most like ourselves all live in Africa. Chimpanzees and gorillas, he argued, are more similar to modern humans than are Asian orangutans. For his contemporaries, though, discriminating between chimps and orangutans was missing the point; it was the thought that we might be related to apes of any kind that was shocking and insulting. But the idea was not as novel as it may have seemed, and many communities have thought of primates as closely related to humans. A Portuguese missionary, Father Alvares, who worked in Sierra Leone early in the seventeenth century, reported that “there are heathen that claim to be descendants of this animal [the dari, or, in modern language, the chimpanzee], and when they see it they have great compassion: they never harm it or strike it, because they consider it the soul of their forefathers, and they think themselves of high parentage. They say they are of the animal’s family, and all that believe they are descended from it call themselves Amienu.”40

According to the classification adopted here, the Hominoidea are divided into three main groups: the Hominidae, the Pongidae (orangutans), and the Hylobatidae (gibbons). The Hominidae, in turn, include two main groups: the Gorillinae (gorillas and chimpanzees) and the Homininae. The Homininae are the only primates who have customarily walked on two legs. Molecular dating techniques suggest that the hominine line diverged from the Gorillinae between 5 and 7 million years ago. Modern humans are the only living members of the hominines, but the group also includes many extinct species, among which are our immediate ancestors (see chapter 6).





EVOLUTION AND THE EARTH’S HISTORY: “GAIA”




I have told the history of life on earth and of the earth itself as if these were different stories. In fact, they are closely linked. The evolution of new life forms transformed the earth’s atmosphere by pumping huge amounts of free oxygen into it. The dead bodies of millions of plants and animals created the carboniferous rocks and the huge deposits of fossil fuels that power modern industries, and in these ways they transformed the earth’s geology. Meanwhile, archaebacteria excavated and mined the regions beneath the seabed.

It is possible that the impact of life on our planet has been even more far-reaching. James Lovelock has argued that forms of cooperation between living organisms are much more extensive than we normally recognize. Indeed, he has argued that in some sense living organisms constitute a single, earthwide system; he calls it “Gaia,” after the Greek goddess of the earth. Gaia acts as a huge self-regulating superorganism, which automatically maintains an environment suitable for life at the earth’s surface.



The Gaia hypothesis, when we introduced it in the 1970s, supposed that the atmosphere, the oceans, the climate, and the crust of the Earth are regulated at a state comfortable for life because of the behavior of living organisms. Specifically, the Gaia hypothesis said that the temperature, oxidation state, acidity, and certain aspects of the rocks and waters are at any time kept constant, and that this homeostasis is maintained by active feedback processes operated automatically and unconsciously by the biota.41





As one illustration of these mechanisms, Lovelock points out that though the heat emitted by the Sun has almost certainly increased by perhaps 40 percent during the last 4.6 billion years, the temperatures at the earth’s surface appear to have been maintained at roughly 15°C, or within the range suitable for life to evolve and flourish. What mechanisms could maintain such a stable global thermostat? Algal blooms may provide an example of these feedback processes, linking the living and nonliving environments. Many algae generate a gas called dimethyl sulfide (DMS). When it reacts with oxygen high in the atmosphere, DMS creates minute particles around which water vapor condenses. In effect, by producing large amounts of DMS, algae create clouds. Massive cloud cover reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface, cooling the earth’s surface and thus reducing the numbers of algae near the surface. As a result, the amount of DMS generated declines, cloud cover begins to decline, and the amount of sunlight reaching the surface increases. So algae create a sort of worldwide thermostat, which maintains the earth’s surface within a limited range of temperatures by constantly adjusting the amount of cloud cover. Lovelock’s theory holds that the biosphere (the totality of life on Earth) is held in a state of rough equilibrium by many interlocking negative feedback loops of this kind.42

One reason why Lovelock’s theory has been greeted with skepticism is that it is hard to explain why particular species should have evolved in ways that benefit the biosphere as a whole. The theory of natural selection encourages us to think of competition rather than cooperation as the dominant force in evolution, because there are many individuals and few niches. So the existence of cooperation between species always requires special explanation. Within multicellular organisms, genetic similarity seems to explain cooperation. And we have already seen that there are many forms of symbiosis in which both species benefit. But the idea of cooperation on a global scale is harder to justify. Why should algae have evolved the capacity to emit DMS unless it is “adaptive” for the species that have evolved this ability, unless it helps them reproduce their own genes? Lovelock has always insisted that there must be a Darwinian logic behind such processes, but explaining that logic is not easy. In specific instances, we can sometimes see how the benefits to a particular species coincide with those to the biosphere as a whole. It has been suggested, for example, that some algae may have the ability to ride high in rising air currents before descending again in rain. Because it disperses their offspring widely, this process offers a clear evolutionary advantage to the species as a whole. The release of DMS may help in the process in several ways. When reacting with oxygen, DMS can generate heat that may help create updrafts to carry bacteria aloft. Once high in the clouds, the water vapor and ice crystals that form around the by products of this reaction can protect the algae from drying out in the upper atmosphere. The same ice crystals may also help carry them back to earth. Such arguments, like the “hidden hand” of Adam Smith’s economic theory, may help explain how competition between individuals and species led to outcomes that were, on balance, beneficial to most life-forms. The seeding of clouds may be just one of myriad ways in which life itself, particularly bacterial life, helps keep the biosphere in a state suitable for the survival of life in general.43

There is a further possibility, which is that cooperation is far more natural in the bacterial realm than in the realm of large organisms because bacteria exchange genetic information more freely than do large organisms. As we have seen, bacteria can exchange replicons almost as easily as modern humans exchange coins. This means that in the bacterial world, at least, natural selection shapes entire teams of bacteria that work together. As Margulis and Sagan put it:



Its minimal number of genes leaving it deficient in metabolic abilities, a bacterium is necessarily a team player. A bacterium never functions as a single individual in nature. Instead, in any given ecological niche, teams of several kinds of bacteria live together, responding to and reforming the environment, aiding each other with complementary enzymes… . Intricately meshed in this way, bacteria occupy and drastically alter their environments. In huge and changing numbers, they perform tasks of which individually they are incapable.44





If this argument is correct, it may be that bacterial cooperation extends even to the planetary scale—in which case it would be much easier to explain the forms of cooperation that Lovelock has detected within “Gaia.” It would certainly make sense of the fact that bacteria seem to play the crucial roles in maintaining the viability of the biosphere.

Whether the Gaia hypothesis is literally true or not, it is a powerful and inspiring idea. “Si non è vero, è hen trovato” (if it isn’t true, it was well invented). Besides, it is abundantly clear that living organisms really have transformed the earth’s surface. But the reverse is also true. Geological changes have shaped evolution. In eras in which most of the continents were joined together, there was less biodiversity than in eras in which the continents were scattered more widely over the face of the planet, because there was less ecological variety. Today, the continents are widely scattered, so life has been exceptionally diverse in the earth’s recent history (until the actions of our own species began to reduce that diversity in the past few centuries). By altering the number and variety of available niches, the rearrangement of the continents by plate tectonics may explain why in the past 500 million years there have been at least five periods of sharply declining biodiversity—periods in which perhaps 75 percent or more of all species may have vanished. Of these, the most catastrophic occurred in the late Permian period, ca. 250 million years ago, as the supercontinent of Pangaea formed. In this period, it appears that more than 95 percent of all marine species may have become extinct.45 The evolution of primates occurred during a period of accelerated evolutionary change caused both by the meteoritic impact of the late Cretaceous and by the existence of an exceptional number of distinct ecological niches in a geologically complex world.

The precise configuration of continents and seas at any time can also profoundly affect climatic patterns. Indeed, our own species evolved in a period of unusually rapid climatic and ecological change. Climates became cooler during the Miocene epoch, from 23 to 5.2 million years ago. Reduced evaporation from the oceans meant that climates generally also became drier, so that forests shrank while steppe and desert regions spread. These changes were partly due to rearrangement of the earth’s continental masses, as the Atlantic sea widened, and as Africa and India both drifted north to collide, respectively, with the western and eastern parts of the Eurasian landmass. When warm, equatorial water can circulate freely to the poles, it keeps the earth’s climates warm. In the current era, the presence of Antarctica over the South Pole prevents warm water from warming the South Pole, while the circle of continents around the North Pole limits the movement of equatorial waters northward. This conjunction, which blocks off the circulation of warm water at both poles, may be unique in the planet’s history. The trend toward cooler, drier climates has accelerated during the Pliocene epoch, from 5.2 to 1.6 million years ago, and into the Pleistocene, the epoch in which our hominine ancestors evolved. About 6 million years ago the Mediterranean became a semienclosed inland sea locking up some 6 percent of the salt of the world’s oceans. With lower concentrations of salt, the remaining oceans froze more easily and the ice cap of the Antarctic began to expand rapidly, causing a sharp fall in world temperatures. About 3.5 to 2.5 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in the northern hemisphere and in Antarctica, and by 900,000 years ago there were already large sheets in the far north. The world had entered the “ice ages” (see figure 5.2).46

Specialists in climatic history can now measure the most recent changes in global climates with great precision. Oxygen has three isotopes (i.e., atoms with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei). Because ice sheets and water absorb them in different amounts, the ratio of these isotopes remaining in the oceans varies depending on the amount of water locked up in ice. By finding fossil organisms that have taken in oxygen, and measuring the ratios of these isotopes in their remains, scientists can estimate the size and extent of the world’s ice sheets when these organisms were alive. Such calculations show that within the longer, cooling trend, there have also been shorter cycles of warmer and colder periods. These are partly caused by changes in the earth’s tilt and orbit. It is now clear that the frequency of these shorter cycles has changed in the last 5 million years. A complete cycle, from a warm interglacial period to a longer glacial period and back again, lasted about 40,000 years up to ca. 2.8 million years ago. From then until ca. 1 million years ago, they lasted about 70,000 years, and in the last million years the dominant cycles have lasted about 100,000 years.47 The current pattern seems to consist of brief interglacials, or warm periods, lasting about 10,000 years, and much longer cool periods, with short periods of extreme cold preceding quite rapid transitions to a new interglacial. The most recent ice age began about 100,000 years ago, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago. So, for the last 10,000 years, the earth has been in a warm, interglacial phase of these cycles.

The significance of both the long-term cooling of the earth’s climates and of these shorter-term cycles for the study of hominine evolution is that they created unstable ecological conditions. All land organisms had to adapt to periodic changes in climate and vegetation, and that necessity undoubtedly accelerated the pace of evolutionary change. Modern humans are one product of this period of accelerated change.





Figure 5.2. Temperature fluctuations at different timescales. There is nothing new about global warming; average surface temperatures on earth have fluctuated on several different scales throughout the earth’s history. As these graphs show, our species evolved in an era of cooling temperatures. But temperature changes appear to have become more erratic in the past million years or so, the period known as the ice ages. From A. J.

INDIVIDUAL SPECIES AND THEIR HISTORIES




Today, there may be between 10 and 100 million different species on the earth. Each consists of many individual organisms that can, in principle, interbreed. Species may be divided into many regional populations, which are separated geographically. A population consists of those members of a species who actually encounter each other and may breed, while the species consists of all individuals who are biologically similar enough to interbreed, even if, in practice, most will never meet.

The rest of this book will focus on the history of just one of these many species, our own. But first it may be worth describing some of the more general features of species histories. Ever since Darwin, it has been clear that species are not eternal. They evolve from other species; they exist, sometimes for many millions of years; then they either become extinct or evolve into one or more other species. In this sense, each species has its own history, even though most of these histories will never be recorded. During its lifetime, each species may undergo minor changes of many different kinds. Regional variations may appear, but biologists will continue to classify the individuals as members of a single species as long as they can continue to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. For example, all modern breeds of dogs can interbreed, despite their great variety of shapes, sizes, and temperaments (which is the product of artificial selection). This is why domestic dogs are regarded as members of a single biological species.

We can describe a species’ history largely in terms of its population history. If a new species succeeds in establishing itself, then it has found a niche within the community of other species, a way of extracting enough resources from the environment so that individual members of the species can successfully survive and reproduce. Migration into new regions, or minor innovations in lifeways or genetic endowment, may enable a species to widen that niche, or even to exploit new niches or new regions. When this happens, the population of a species may grow. And its growth often follows a characteristic pattern that we can summarize in a formula: migration, innovation, growth, overexploitation, decline, and stabilization (MIGODS).48 The initial innovation leads to rapid population growth. Eventually, too many individuals are produced, until at least one critical resource (such as food, water, or space) becomes so scarce that further growth is impossible.49 This is the stage of overexploitation. It is followed by sometimes catastrophic population decline, though the decline may be less drastic if population growth slowed as the species reached the maximum sustainable level. Finally, populations may rise again as the species adapts in subtler ways to the opportunities and limits of its environment and reaches the stage of stabilization. In its existence, a particular species may pass through this cycle many times. But eventually there will come a time when a phase of decline is not followed by a phase of stabilization—perhaps because the environment changes, or because other species transform the environment in ways that prove fatal. The species will become extinct, though it may leave descendants that are different enough to be classified as members of a new species.

This rhythm is described graphically in figure 5.3, which charts the population growth of an imaginary species. It provides a way of describing the characteristic rhythms of a species’ history, and of its relationship with other species and with the biosphere as a whole. It also provides some ideas that may help us identify some of the more important similarities and differences between our own history and the histories of other species.





SUMMARY




During almost 4 billion years, evolutionary processes have generated all the biological diversity apparent on the modern earth. Indeed, the species alive today are only a tiny sample of the total number of species that have evolved during the earth’s history.

For more than 3 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. However, even in the world of bacteria there was change. Cells acquired the ability to secure energy from sunlight and eventually from oxygen. Eukaryotic cells acquired internal organelles. And from ca. 600 million years ago, some cells joined together to form multicellular organisms, the first nonmicroscopic organisms on earth. Since the Cambrian explosion, trees, flowers, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and primates have all evolved. Many other evolutionary experiments may also have flourished and vanished without leaving any traces.

As life evolved so did the earth itself, and the two processes were interrelated at many points. Living organisms created carboniferous rocks and an oxygen-rich atmosphere. At the same time, the processes of plate tectonics slowly shaped and reshaped the earth’s surface and its climatic patterns in ways that accelerated or slowed the rate of evolutionary change, while violent events such as meteoritic impacts and volcanic eruptions occasionally diverted the course of evolution in particular regions. The biosphere and the earth have evolved together as part of a complex, interlinked system.

Within this constantly changing system, the basic ecological units are particular species. Each has its own history, which is governed by relations with other species. The history of each species is shaped mainly by that species’ particular niche, the way it extracts resources (including food) from its surroundings. Over time, the niche of a species may alter in more or less subtle ways, and these alterations may affect the population of the species. The history of each species is shaped largely by these fluctuations in numbers, which are related in turn to changes in the environment and to the way each species exploits its environment. The characteristic ways in which populations change suggest a way of approaching the history of living species in general and our own species in particular.
