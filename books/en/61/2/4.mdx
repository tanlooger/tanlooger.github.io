LIFE: A NEW LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY




“What is life?” The physicist Erwin Schrödinger asked this question in a famous series of lectures given in Dublin in 1943. Schrödinger’s answer was remarkably prescient, for he wrote before we had any real understanding of the genetic basis of life. He argued that we should be able to explain life as scientifically as we can explain physics or chemistry. But he also understood that we cannot define life simply by referring to a checklist. Like all complex entities, living organisms manage significant flows of energy and matter, so they must have some form of metabolism. They take in and excrete energy and nutrients. They also reproduce, again like many other complex but nonliving entities from tornadoes to crystals. So neither metabolism nor reproduction alone can provide a satisfactory definition of life; it is the way they work together to create a new level of complexity that is critical. Schrödinger therefore suggested another way of defining what is distinctive about life. Life is not just complex—it is significantly more complex than anything else in the universe; and the level of orderliness achieved by living organisms is remarkable, given the general tendency of the universe toward disorder. “The unfolding of events in the life cycle of an organism exhibits an admirable regularity and orderliness, unrivalled by anything we meet with in inanimate matter.”1

Stars can climb the thermodynamic down escalator (see appendix 2), but living organisms climb it with greater agility. Indeed, Eric Chaisson has argued that the level of complexity achieved by living organisms can be measured, roughly but quite objectively, by estimating the density of the energy flows that sustain them against the destructive pressure of the second law of thermodynamics.2 Table 4.1 gives Chaisson’s approximations of these energy flows. The right-hand column, which measures the amount of free energy passing through a given mass in a given amount of time, appears to indicate that living organisms can handle far denser flows of energy than stars without breaking down. And this ability is what lets them climb farther and faster up the thermodynamic down escalator. In Schrödinger’s famous phrase, each living organism seems to have an astonishing capacity for “continually sucking orderliness from its environment.”3 The simplest structures have also been around longest, and the more complex structures have appeared more recently, which suggests that creating them was a more difficult evolutionary task. Finally, it is also clear that the more complex entities in the bottom half of the table are more fragile. While stars and planets may live for many billions of years, even the longest-living organisms (at least those we know of) can live for only a few thousand years, and most live for only a few days or years. That the most complex structures break down so fast is a measure of the difficulty of managing particularly dense energy flows: this is the price living organisms pay for their aggressive challenge to the second law of thermodynamics. Thus in dealing with life we are dealing with a new level of order and complexity, a new capacity to control and organize free energy that is achieved at the price of greater fragility. As Martin Rees has written, “A star is simpler than an insect.”4 But a star also lives much longer.

Chemical processes may have generated life elsewhere in the universe, though at present we do not know if this is true. But we do know that life appeared on Earth within 600 million years of the planet’s creation. By geological standards, and given the harsh conditions of the early earth, that was quick. And from the moment life appeared, living organisms have multiplied and changed in a dazzling and apparently endless cascade of new life forms, each finely tuned to handle the particular energies and resources in its immediate environment. Unlike stars or crystals, which are general, all-purpose antientropy machines, living organisms can adapt constantly to new terrain and new challenges in their more flexible guerrilla war on entropy. Collectively, living organisms explore their environment in ways that have no parallel in the inanimate world. And what they find is new sources of energy and new ways of organizing themselves so as to survive the hurricane of energy flowing through them. Not all of these changes lead to greater complexity, but some do. This is why life has such an astonishing capacity to conjure up new types of complexity.

What is the source of the energy differential that sustains these complex entities? The answer to that question is blessedly clear: the ultimate source is gravity. We have seen that gravity can create stars—objects of great density and high temperatures. But the universe as a whole is extremely cold; its average temperature is about 3°C above absolute zero, the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. So stars are embedded within the cold universe like billions of tiny points of light and heat. It is no accident that we live huddled near a star, for here we can tap the huge energy flows pouring into space from the nuclear furnace at the Sun’s core.

As for the rules of complexity in living organisms, these are different from those that dominate at the astronomical scale. Individual organisms (at least as we know them) flourish at much smaller scales than stars or planets. At those smaller scales, gravity counts; but other forces count for more. Life is shaped largely by electromagnetism and the nuclear forces that control how atoms work. These are the forces that determine how atoms are assembled and how they combine into larger and more complex molecules.

But at the biological level of complexity, new rules appear as well. Living organisms operate according to distinctive and more open-ended rules of change, which are superimposed on the simpler and more deterministic rules of physics and chemistry. The rules of biology are made possible by the high degree of precision with which living organisms reproduce. Handling large energy flows is such a delicate task that it requires extremely precise mechanisms; the rule book for creating and re-creating such structures has to be complex, exact, and accurate. A system of reproduction that could copy these mechanisms only approximately would soon lose the required exactness (though one that copied them perfectly would rule out any possibility of change). Thus, a high level of metabolic precision requires a high (but not perfect) level of reproductive precision. This is why large organisms like ourselves need more genetic information than do bacteria. It is also why most of those studying the origins of life have concentrated on the origins of the genetic code, the intricate molecular “software” that explains why living organisms reproduce with a precision not matched by any other complex entities.

All in all, the shift from chemistry to life counts as one of the great transitions in the history of the universe. Complex organisms, replicating according to new and exquisitely precise blueprints, introduced new types of historical change—certainly on this planet, and perhaps in many other parts of the universe. As chemicals combine to form living organisms, emergent properties appear that we cannot explain simply by studying the chemicals from which organisms are constructed. So, to understand living things, we need a new paradigm, one that takes us beyond the rules of nuclear physics, chemistry, or geology and into the realm of biology. This chapter will discuss the basic rules by which living organisms change, and some current ideas about the origins of life on Earth. It will focus on the ideas of Charles Darwin, who first described clearly what is distinctive about the biological rules of change. The next chapter will survey the history of life on earth.





DARWIN AND THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION




Many societies have tried to explain life by assuming that there is a creator spirit or god who somehow breathed life into inanimate matter. Modern science regards this explanation as the easy way out, because theories that depend on deities can be made to explain more or less anything and are not subject to objective verification. Instead, modern science tries to explain the creation of life as a consequence of inanimate forces and processes, just as it approaches the creation of our sun and earth.

The fundamental idea used in modern biology to explain both the development and the origins of life is that of “evolution” by “natural selection.” The theory was first presented systematically in Charles Darwin’s book On the Origin of Species, which appeared in 1859.5 Darwin rarely used the term evolution, perhaps because it seems to imply some sort of mystical force that drives biological change in particular directions and thus would contradict his own view of biological change as a more open-ended process. However, Herbert Spencer, who did the most to popularize the term, saw biological change as a movement from “lower” to “higher” life-forms, as a form of progress. This is unfortunate, because such an approach introduces arbitrary and subjective value judgments into our understanding of the history of living organisms. But despite the associations carried by evolution, we will continue to use the term simply because it remains the word most commonly applied to Darwin’s theories of biological change.

Darwin argued that species are not fixed entities. They are constantly changing, and the way they change is governed by some simple rules. A species is a large collection of individual organisms that are similar enough to interbreed, but are not quite identical to each other. Species are defined by those features that individuals share rather than by the minor ways in which they differ from each other. However, over long periods of time, random variations in the features of individuals may cause the average features of an entire species to alter. Its average height might change, for example, or the average size of individual brains may grow. Such minor changes, accumulating over thousands of generations, must eventually transform the average features of the entire species. To understand how species change, we therefore must understand how and why the features of some individuals become more common, while those of others dwindle and disappear.

Darwin knew that in most populations only a minority of individuals survive to adulthood and produce offspring. Yet the future of the species can be shaped only by those individuals that do survive and reproduce. So later generations of life are the offspring only of the survivors. (Evolution, like history, apparently is written by the winners.) But what determines which individuals reproduce, and which do not? Pure chance may play a role here, of course. But in the long run, he argued, the individuals most likely to survive and reproduce are those that have had the good luck to inherit from their parents features that make them slightly better adapted to their environment. They will then pass these same features on to most of their offspring. Over time, these features will become more and more common because those individuals that do not possess them will produce fewer healthy offspring, until their lineages die out. Over thousands of generations, many small changes of this kind will ensure that the species as a whole appears to change or evolve in ways that make it better adapted to its environment. In this metaphorical sense, we can say that the environment “naturally” selects certain features and discards others, just as animal breeders “artificially” select some individuals to breed and not others. And it is in this metaphorical sense that species appear over time to “adapt” to their natural environments.

Adaptation is such an important notion in modern biology that it is worth defining more carefully. It refers to the fact that all living organisms seem to be exquisitely fitted for the environments in which they live. Indeed, so perfect is the fit between organisms and their environments that many of Darwin’s opponents argued, as some still argue, that organs such as the human eye or the elephant’s trunk must have been designed by a benign creator. Darwin tried to show that blind processes could do the job equally well. Adaptation helps explain the great variety of living organisms, for there is a huge variation in environments to which organisms can adapt themselves. To describe these different environments, biologists and ecologists use the notions of habitats and niches. Habitats are simply the geographical environments in which species live. The idea of a niche is more complex, as it includes the way they live as well. The word niche is derived from the Latin word meaning “nest.” In architecture, a niche is a recess or alcove in a wall in which a statue or other object can be placed. In biology and ecology, a niche is the particular way of living for which an organism seems to have been sculpted or adapted by evolutionary processes. The niche of a woodpecker is defined by the way it finds edible insects in certain trees; many single-celled bacteria find attractive niches in the guts of larger animals, including ourselves. But of course environments also change—and as they do so, while old niches may close down, new niches may open up elsewhere. As environments are varied and changeable, organisms have to keep adapting if they are to survive. This is why evolution never ends. Because there is no fixed standard of perfection or “progress,” adaptation is an endless process.

Modern biologists use the idea of evolution to explain the colossal variety of life-forms on earth. They also use it to try to explain the initial emergence of life on earth, for it seems that nonliving substances may also have evolved by some simplified form of natural selection. And, given a favorable environment and enough time, they eventually evolved into living organisms. The idea of evolution is so basic to the modern understanding of what life is and how it changes that we must begin our account of the history of life on earth by describing the theory in more detail and seeing how it, too, evolved from older attempts to explain the emergence of life in all its variety.





ORIGINS OF THE MODERN THEORY OF EVOLUTION




We have seen that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some European scientists began to doubt the creation myth of the Judeo-Christian Bible. The Bible seemed to say that species were created by God, about 6,000 years ago, and that they remained essentially as God had created them. This belief was held even by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, the eighteenth-century founder of modern systems of taxonomy, or biological classification. Yet even in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there were difficulties with this account. For example, many fossils suggested the existence of strange creatures never mentioned in the Bible or in historical records. Some, which appeared to be sea creatures, were found high up in mountains that had taken millions of years to create, while others were found buried deep within rocks. Surely, this location suggested, they must have been buried many millions of years ago.

Then there was the fact, known to every farmer, that species of dogs, cats, cattle, and sheep are not as fixed as they might seem. Indeed, by careful choice of mates, breeders of pigeons or dogs can produce some very strange creatures. Darwin was fascinated by the activities of pigeon breeders, and he was a member of two London pigeon clubs. Here, he describes some of the varieties he saw, all apparently bred from the common rock pigeon:



Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short tails… . The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter.6





Did these exotic creatures belong to the same species that God had originally created? Or were they entirely new species? If they were new, then apparently God was continually tinkering with life—and such tinkering seemed to imply that his original creation may have been less than perfect. As Europeans traveled more widely in the centuries after Columbus, they also became aware that there were many more species than were mentioned in the Bible. The many contrasts in animal and plant life found in the Pacific, the Americas, and Eurasia posed a great challenge to Christian theologians. Had God created all these species? If so, why in such profusion? And why had he distributed them in such a curious and arbitrary way across the globe? Why were there no kangaroos in England, and no pandas in Australia?

By the late eighteenth century, some biologists were considering the possibility that living organisms changed over time by natural mechanisms of some kind, as it seemed messy to suppose that God was continually tinkering with his creation. Perhaps such a mechanism could account for why there were so many species and subspecies, and why so many were not described in the biblical account of creation. The trouble was that no one could explain how or why species changed.

In the early nineteenth century, Darwin’s uncle, Erasmus Darwin, suggested that species evolved so as to adapt better to their environments. This made sense, because all living species do, indeed, seem to fit their environments with great precision. But, like all biologists of his time, he had no clear idea how they became so well adapted. In a book first published in 1809, the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck suggested a possible mechanism. Perhaps minor changes acquired during a creature’s lifetime could somehow be passed on to its descendants. For example, he argued, the ancestors of giraffes may have stretched to browse on leaves high up in trees. Those that stretched hardest may have passed on their long necks to their offspring. Gradually, long necks would have become more and more common, until eventually they became the main distinguishing feature of an entire species. Unfortunately, any animal breeder could tell what was wrong with this theory. Acquired characteristics—that is, qualities acquired through a particular lifestyle or the exertions of a particular individual—are not normally passed on to offspring. Only inherited characteristics are transmitted in this way. Time we spend in the gym does not guarantee that our children will be fit. A fattened pig will not necessarily produce fat offspring; but a pig whose ancestors were fat is likely to produce fat offspring.

Lamarck’s mechanism didn’t work. But if the genetic makeup of organisms was determined by their past (by what they inherited from their parents), how was it possible for them to adapt to present-day conditions? This was the conundrum that Darwin solved. From childhood, Darwin was fascinated by animals, and by his twenties he was already an expert naturalist. Like most naturalists of the day, he understood that species are malleable. He also understood that humans were quite capable of altering species through artificial selection. What he didn’t know yet was why species also changed without human intervention. What, apart from a god or a human being, could allow some individuals to reproduce and condemn others to genetic extinction?

In 1831, his abilities as a naturalist and some fortunate family connections secured him a position as the naturalist on a ship called the Beagle, which was embarking on an expedition around the globe. Darwin was staggered by the variety of species he encountered on this trip, and by the extremely subtle variations he noted between closely related species. He also saw clear fossil evidence of evolution in creatures such as armadillos. In South America, he saw fossil animals that were similar to living animals, but with slight differences. But it was in the Galápagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador, that he discovered the clues that led him eventually to his theory of evolution. There, on a number of recently formed volcanic islands, he found several species of finches that seemed closely related to finches from the American mainland. Yet they differed slightly from island to island. Their beaks, for example, showed minor variations that ensured that each species was adapted with exquisite precision to the particular plants and animals that flourished on its home island.

Here was clear evidence of the sort of adaptation that Erasmus Darwin had written about. Clearly, species could in some sense “adapt” to changing environments. But how did they do it? In about 1838, Darwin read the work of Thomas Malthus, the pioneer of modern population studies, and this seems to have suggested the central idea of his theory. Malthus noted that in most species, including humans, many individuals (sometimes a large majority) do not survive to produce offspring. It was immediately obvious to Darwin that only those individuals that reproduced could have any influence on the nature of later generations. So it was important to explain why some individuals survived and others did not. When he studied the activities of pigeon breeders, the answer was clear. Breeders artificially selected some individuals and allowed only them to reproduce. In Darwin’s time, this was already a highly developed art:



That most skilful breeder, Sir John Selbright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that “he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak.” In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognized, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.7





But what did the selecting in the natural world? What “chose” some individuals to reproduce and condemned others to genetic extinction? What difference was there between those individuals that reproduced and those that did not?

The answer, he suggested, was “fitness.” In a statistical sense, it had to be true that the individuals that survived and had healthy offspring were fractionally healthier than those that did not. They reproduced because they were healthy enough to survive longer than others and to find a healthy mate. In individual cases, of course, luck may have played a role. (If lightning strikes you dead, it really doesn’t matter how “fit” you were.) But with large numbers, and over large periods of time, fitness must have played the crucial role. On average, those individuals that survived to adulthood and reproduced must have been slightly healthier, slightly better adapted to their environments, than the nonsurvivors. So it wasn’t really that species adapted; it was the other way around. Those individuals who happened to be better adapted by pure chance were the ones most likely to survive and shape future generations of their species.

Darwin understood that this random statistical process of sorting, which occurs in all forms of life generation after generation, could alter species as effectively as any human breeder if repeated with sufficient frequency. Over and over again, millions of times in each generation, the environment eliminated some individuals, while allowing others to survive. Later generations inherited only the qualities of the survivors; as a result, over time the entire species began to resemble the survivors more than the nonsurvivors. In a metaphorical sense, then, the environment was acting like a human animal breeder. And this was why Darwin called the mechanism “natural selection,” in contrast to the “artificial selection” performed by those who bred animals.

In this way, Darwin showed that purely statistical and totally mindless processes, repeated over and over again, could explain how species changed in ways that seemed to make them constantly adapt to changing environments. To understand his argument fully, it is vital to understand the random nature of many of these processes. Individuals vary from their parents in minor but essentially random ways. They do not, in any sense, “try” to adapt. It is not the individuals that “evolve,” but the average features of the species.

Darwin argued that these mechanisms, repeated over long periods of time, can also explain how distinct species arose, for it is clear that populations of a single species scattered over a large area, and shaped by slightly different environments, are likely to evolve in slightly different ways. The Galápagos finches were a clear example to him of an early stage in the creation of distinct species. Over time, Darwin argued, such processes could explain all the variety of living organisms to be found on earth. As an admirer of the geologist Charles Lyell, Darwin was sure that the earth had existed for a very long time—long enough, perhaps, for such minute changes to create the huge variety of species existing today.

These were astonishing conclusions, for they implied something utterly revolutionary: all the beautiful and complex organisms on Earth, from amoebae to elephants to hummingbirds to human beings, can be created by blind, repetitive processes. Unconscious processes can create not just stars and galaxies, it seemed, but even life itself.8 Such reasoning seemed to deprive God himself of any reason for existence, which is why Darwin’s theory has met, and still meets today, such profound resistance.

Here is how Darwin himself described the workings of natural selection:



There is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature … [since] more individuals are born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die,—which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct… . Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual or any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection[.]9





EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION




In On the Origin of Species Darwin stated, as clearly as possible, the arguments for his theory of evolution. He also tried to deal with some possible objections to it. He had few illusions about the difficulty of the task he faced. Most of his readers were traditional Christians. They believed that God had created distinct species, and the thought that species might have emerged through blind processes shocked them. So it was to this audience that Darwin directed most of his arguments.

He was able to show from the fossil record that species seem to change over time. But this was perhaps the least powerful argument available to him, for the fossil record consists of a series of individual, fossilized “photos”; his opponents could easily argue that each was a distinct species created separately by God, and now extinct. What Darwin had to show was the existence of transitional species. Some fossils did appear to be halfway between existing animal types. The most famous fossil of this kind was the birdlike dinosaur known as archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago. Archaeopteryx seemed to be half reptile and half bird. The first fossil specimen was found in 1862, just after the publication of The Origin of Species, and Darwin was able to comment on it in later editions. It was exactly the sort of discovery that Darwin’s theory had predicted. However, it was also easy for opponents to point out that the fossil record was extremely imperfect. There were vast gaps in all fossil lineages, so that the fossil record on its own could never offer a completely satisfactory proof of the workings of natural selection.

Darwin also offered many other types of evidence for his theory. He argued that where modern species shared many common features, this was a sign that they had evolved from common ancestors. Oddly, the evidence for this claim was most persuasive where apparently useless features survived from remote ancestors by a sort of biological conservatism. Whales have finger bones, which have no obvious adaptive function today. But their existence does make sense if we assume that modern whales are descended from land animals that once did have a use for hands and fingers. Indeed, modern whales may be distantly related to hippopotami, a species of contemporary mammals that seems to be in the early stages of adapting to an aquatic lifestyle. The theory of natural selection could explain such phenomena easily, for it suggested that organisms evolve in tiny steps, preserving much from the past, even if some of those features cease to be of any use. This argument was particularly persuasive because traditional theories found such evidence difficult to explain. What reason could a god have for preserving such useless organs, rather than redesigning each species from scratch?

Darwin was also able to show that the geographical distribution of species was more consistent with his theory than with the theory of God the Creator. Why should a god not have placed particular species in all those regions of the earth for which they were adapted? Why weren’t all deserts full of camels? Why, instead, did naturalists find that most species in a particular region were closely related—so that, for example, in Australia there were mouselike creatures that were more closely related to kangaroos than to the mice of Europe? Darwin’s answer, of course, was that marsupials lived in Australia because that was where their ancestors had lived. That was where they had evolved.

Particularly distasteful to Darwin’s critics was another implication of his theory: humans might be closely related to apes (an implication that is alive and well today; see chapter 6). To some people, the idea is still distasteful; the anthropologist Yves Coppens remembers his grandmother saying to him: “You may have descended from a monkey, but 7 certainly didn’t!”10 But in Darwin’s time, his theory faced many other difficulties. For example, most geologists believed the earth to be no more than 100 million years old. Darwin understood that natural selection needed huge periods of time in which to generate the immense variety of creatures present on Earth, and he conceded that 100 million years was probably not long enough. He believed that evolution worked extremely slowly. Indeed, he was convinced it worked so slowly that it could never be observed directly, and thus all the evidence for evolution would have to be indirect. Furthermore, nineteenth-century biologists had no real understanding of how inheritance worked. For Darwin’s theory to work, the mechanism of inheritance had to be very accurate (otherwise no stable species could exist), but not too accurate (otherwise there would never be change). It was important that the qualities of parents be passed on to their offspring, but it was also important that there should be slight variations that might either enhance or threaten the health of particular individuals. But because no one understood fully how the mechanism of heredity worked, it was not certain that heredity worked in exactly the way required. Darwin himself could only suggest that the qualities of parents were “blended.” like two colors mixed together. But this seemed to guarantee that variations from the norm would be eliminated in each generation, even if they were beneficial, an outcome that would have made natural selection impossible. The absence of a clear understanding of inheritance was to undermine the credibility of Darwin’s theory for more than half a century.

Most of the difficulties Darwin faced were to be resolved in the twentieth century. Religious resistance to the theory of evolution diminished. Meanwhile, new types of evidence emerged to bolster the theory, and gaps in it were filled in. In important respects, Darwin’s theory has been modified and improved. As a result, Darwin’s central ideas have become the fundamental organizing principle of modern scientific accounts of the history of life on earth.

One reason why his theory is now so widely adopted is that in the twentieth century it proved possible to see evolution at work directly. It is easiest to watch evolution when studying small species that breed rapidly, such as fruit flies. We have also seen evolution at work when new forms of bacteria have appeared in response to the use of antibiotics (as further discussed below).

The fossil record is also much richer than it was in Darwin’s time, and new discoveries have created a fuller account of evolution over long periods. This account can never completely prove Darwin’s theories, but it remains perfectly consistent with them. Modern dating techniques, by pushing the age of the earth back from 100 million years to over 4 billion years, have also provided a time span forty times as long for Darwinian processes to work in. Finally, twentieth-century biologists came to understand how inheritance works, and their account is fully consistent with Darwin’s theory. Gregor Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin’s, had already figured out the basic principles of heredity, though his work was ignored until the twentieth century. He showed that although sexually reproducing organisms inherit traits (or genes) from both parents, they inherit them in discrete packages—one from this parent, and one from that. He also showed that in many instances, only one of these traits is expressed in the offspring. If your parents have blue and brown eyes, this doesn’t mean that your eyes will be a muddy blue; you will inherit one color or the other. So inheritance does not automatically lead to the dilution of traits that Darwin had feared. Particular genes may not be passed on to all offspring; but if they are, they are passed on intact. We also understand exactly how genes are transmitted from generation to generation. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, transmits genetic information from an organism to its offspring with great accuracy, so that species have great stability. But it is not perfect. As DNA copies itself, it makes, on average, one error for every billion bits of genetic information, the equivalent of a typist making one error in half a million pages. This allows for the small variations necessary if evolution is to occur.11 The explanation of DNA’s structure by Francis Crick and James Watson, in 1953, was therefore a crucial stage in the consolidation of Darwin’s theory as the central idea of modern biology.

Modern microbiology has also proved another hunch of Darwin’s: all organisms on earth are related. All living organisms, from the simplest bacteria to the largest modern mammals, contain cells that use the same basic chemical processes and pathways. And they all use the same genetic code. In this sense, all living organisms are related. This means one of two things. Either life evolved only once or life evolved more than once, but only one of these experiments has survived to the present day, while all other lineages were eventually wiped out. In either case, all organisms living today, from humans to bananas to sea squirts and amoebae, are descended from the same (bacterial) ancestor.

In minor ways, Darwin’s theory has been modified. For example, Darwin seems to have believed that all evolutionary changes occurred because they enhanced the survival chances of the individuals that carried them. But it is now clear that many genetic changes occur at random. There are large amounts of genetic material (perhaps as much as 97 percent of the human genome, for example) that have no impact on the makeup of the adult individual, so changes in these areas will not directly affect an individual’s chance of survival. The general principle seems to be this: random changes that have no impact on the survival chances of individual members of a species can lead to slow, and essentially random, changes in the genetic structure (or genotype) of an entire species. However, such “neutral” changes may become significant in the future, if, as sometimes happens, some of these inactive genes are reactivated.

Darwin also seems to have believed that evolution occurred at a steady pace. It is now clear that this is not always true. In periods of climatic or environmental stability, species may change slowly. But if environments or climates change more rapidly, species can evolve and diversify very quickly. This is precisely how modern bacteria have evolved in response to the challenge of modern antibiotics. Where antibiotics are widely used, those individual bacteria least affected by antibiotics suddenly become much more likely to produce healthy offspring. Within a few generations, their genes will tend to dominate the species. In this way, there have appeared new species of bacteria that seem more or less immune to the action of antibiotics. It now appears that this rhythm is normal in evolution. During the earth’s history, there have been both periods of extremely rapid evolutionary change and periods of relative biological stability. Evolution works in fits and starts, according to the modern theory of “punctuated evolution,’ which was proposed by Niles Eldridge and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972.





THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE ON EARTH




Modern Darwinian theory can explain how modern organisms have evolved from the simple life-forms present on the early earth (see the next chapter). But can it take the next step and explain the origin of the earliest life-forms? Is it possible to offer a purely scientific explanation of the emergence of life from nonliving matter?

The notion that life might appear spontaneously has been taken seriously by scientists from at least the time of classical Greece.12 And with good reason. After all, maggots seem to appear, apparently from nowhere, on the carcasses of dead animals. In the seventeenth century, studies using the newly invented microscope demonstrated that the air was full of tiny organisms, making it possible to explain the apparently spontaneous growth of organisms such as maggots by supposing that their eggs traveled through the air and settled on decaying meat. But this still left open the possibility that tiny microorganisms might be generated spontaneously, perhaps by some form of “life force” floating in the air.

In a remarkably simple experiment, the French biologist Louis Pasteur seemed to finally disprove the idea that life could be generated spontaneously. All life is based on organic molecules—that is, on molecules that use carbon. Because carbon can bond to itself in complex ways, it can form more complex and varied molecules than any other element. By the nineteenth century, many experiments had shown that if soups rich in organic materials were boiled to kill all living organisms, and then placed in airtight containers, no life would appear. However, some argued that this was because the containers excluded an all-pervasive life force. In 1862, Pasteur devised an ingenious experiment to test this idea. He boiled a broth of organic materials, and then placed it not in a sealed container but in a swan-necked container, open to the air. On the one hand, if a life force existed, it would surely be able to enter and use the organic materials to generate new organisms. On the other hand, spores or microorganisms floating in the air would not be able to travel up the neck of the retort. Pasteur’s broths have remained sterile for more than a century, and can still be seen today in Paris. His experiment seemed to prove, finally, that life could not be generated spontaneously and that there was no life force floating through the air. Life could be generated only from life.

This cleared up one mystery, only to create another. If life could not be generated from nonlife, then how had life appeared on the early earth? Paleontologists knew that life seemed to appear quite suddenly in the so-called Cambrian era, which we now know began less than 600 million years ago. How could this sudden burst of life be explained? Were biologists forced back to the idea of a creator deity? Many nineteenth-century biologists felt they were, because any purely scientific explanation of the origins of life had to suppose that life could be generated from nonliving material, and Pasteur seemed to have shown that this was impossible. Another possibility was to argue that organic molecules were somehow quite different from inorganic molecules. Perhaps they were different in their origins and their capacity to generate life. Was there something special about carbon? This theory was disproved when chemists showed in the mid-nineteenth century that many organic molecules could be synthesized from inorganic chemicals in the laboratory.

Not until the twentieth century did a more plausible scientific theory of the origins of life emerge. This account, pioneered in the 1920s by Alexander Oparin and J. B. S. Haldane, uses the basic ideas of evolutionary theory to explain not just the evolution of life on earth but also its initial appearance. Its key idea is that evolution works to some extent even among complex but nonliving chemicals. Thus even some chemicals may be capable of evolving if, like crystals, they can stabilize themselves and create reasonably accurate copies of themselves. Once this happens, then those chemicals that produce the most stable “offspring” (i.e., the offspring best adapted to their environment) will tend to multiply more rapidly than those whose descendants survive less well. Such a process would be similar to Darwinian evolution. As such chemicals became better adapted to their environment, they might also become more complex until, eventually, we might start thinking of them as living organisms. Biologists refer to these processes as chemical evolution.

But precisely how chemical evolution generated the first living organisms remains unclear. To understand these difficulties, we must break the problem into several levels. First, we need to explain how the basic raw materials of life were created: the chemical level. Second, we need to explain how these simple organic materials were assembled into more complex structures. Finally, we need to explain the origins of the precise mechanisms of reproduction encoded in the DNA that is present in all living organisms today. At present, we have reasonably good answers to the first question; we have plausible answers to the second question; and we are still puzzled by the third question.

The first task now seems surprisingly easy Living organisms are constructed, for the most part, from compounds of carbon and hydrogen. Carbon is critical because of its astonishing flexibility. Add hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur and we can account for 99 percent of the dry weight of all living organisms.13 It turns out that where the conditions are right and these chemicals are abundant, it is easy to construct simple organic molecules, including amino acids (the building blocks of proteins, the basic structural materials of all organisms) and nucleotides (the building blocks of the genetic code).14 Pasteur’s experiment had seemed to show that such molecules could not form spontaneously We now know why: today’s atmosphere, with its large amounts of free oxygen, offers a peculiarly hostile environment for simple organic molecules. Oxygen is extremely reactive, and when it reacts it generates heat (we normally become aware of its destructive power in fires). Oxygen is particularly destructive of organic molecules such as those in wood or paper. Wherever possible, it breaks them down into water and carbon dioxide in a form of slow burning.

However, Oparin and Haldane pointed out there may have been little free oxygen in the atmosphere of the early earth. Perhaps, then, life appeared long before the Cambrian era, in an oxygen-free atmosphere that allowed simple organic molecules to survive long enough to engage in the complex, slow-motion chemistry needed for chemical evolution to take place. In 1952 this possibility was tested in a famous, and remarkably simple, laboratory experiment conducted by two American scientists: Harold Urey and his graduate student, Stanley Miller. They created a model of the early atmosphere by filling a large, closed retort with methane, water, and ammonia. They warmed the mixture, and provided shots of free energy by passing electric currents through it, thereby simulating the lightning that undoubtedly flashed through the skies of the early earth. After seven days, they found a dark-red sludge in their retort. This contained several of the twenty most important amino acids. Amino acids are simple organic molecules (containing about twenty to forty atoms) that link up in different patterns to form the proteins that dominate the chemistry and the structure of all living organisms. By rerunning the experiment under slightly different conditions and in slightly different pseudo-atmospheres, scientists have shown that all twenty basic amino acids can be manufactured in this way. Here we have the basis for the construction of proteins, the fundamental building blocks of life. The Miller-Urey experiment also created, in smaller quantities, other important organic molecules, including sugars and the main components of nucleotides, the molecules from which the genetic code is constructed.

Some claimed that Miller and Urey had come close to creating living organisms. It is now clear that this was not so. Many difficult steps lie between the creation of simple organic molecules and the creation of life. In any case, the atmosphere of the early earth probably contained less ammonia and methane than the two chemists had supposed, and more carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Such an atmosphere would have been less fertile in simple organic molecules. But the Miller-Urey experiment remains important nevertheless. What it showed is that the creation of many of the basic chemical building blocks of life may not have been too hard on the early earth.

Since this experiment, amino acids, simple nucleotides, and even the phospholipids from which cell membranes are constructed have turned up in many surprising environments, both on Earth and in space. Amino acids have been identified in dust clouds in interstellar space. So have vast quantities of water and alcohols, which are vital to the manufacture of phospholipids. We know that both water vapor and many simple organic molecules are also present within meteorites and comets. The presence in space of water, as well as many different types of simple organic molecules, suggests that the entire solar system has been bombarded throughout its history with life’s raw materials, either through violent impacts or through the constant drift of cosmic dust onto planetary surfaces. Indeed, it now seems possible that several bodies within the solar system—including Mars; Venus; Jupiter’s planets, Europa and Callisto; and Saturn’s moon, Titan—may have had (and in some cases may still have) liquid water, so they could have evolved simple organic molecules, even if they are now sterile (as both Venus and Mars seem to be). It is also possible that at least in their early life, the planets swapped organic material, as debris chipped off the planets by meteoritic impacts floated between them. In 1996, for example, it was claimed that a meteorite found in Antarctica, which had arrived about 13,000 years ago, contained trapped gases corresponding to the mix of gases in Mars’s thin atmosphere. If this claim is correct (and many scientists doubt that it is), it may mean the meteorite came from Mars. If we discover living organisms on Mars, we will have to take seriously the possibility that they are related to us.15 All in all, it now appears that the basic chemicals from which life is formed were abundant in the early solar system.

The second task is more difficult. It is to explain how these simple chemicals, containing no more than a few tens of molecules at the most, were assembled into the vast and complex structures necessary for life to exist. Even viruses contain up to 10 billion atoms organized in highly specific patterns, while the complex cells of plants and animals each contain between 1 and 100 trillion (i.e., 1012 to 1014) atoms. At present, there is little certainty about where or how this great leap in size and complexity was achieved. Yet it was this change that created true life from organic chemicals. Currently, there seem to be three possible answers to the question of where life first began. It may have been created first in space, or on the surface of planets, or (and this is the latest possibility) deep within planets.

For many years, Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have argued that Earth was seeded with life from outside. This theory is known as Panspermia. If organisms were first created on planets somewhere else in the universe, then of course we have simply shifted the problem to another planet, and are still left to explain how life could have been constructed there rather than here. Alternatively, it has been suggested that extremely simple organisms were assembled in space. We know that chemical processes occur in interstellar space, and that some simple organisms are robust enough to survive periods of space travel. Yet at present it seems unlikely that life itself could have originated in space, where both energy and raw materials are in short supply, thereby ensuring that chemical processes are normally very slow. Besides, many of the chemical reactions vital to life seem to require water in liquid form, and this cannot be found in space.

Planets—where conditions are more complex, free energy is more abundant, liquid water can collect, and chemicals occur in greater density and profusion—offer a more promising theater for biogenesis. Until recently, most biologists assumed that if life originated on Earth, it must have appeared on the surface. As early as 1871, Darwin suggested that life might have begun in “some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc.”16 Ever since Darwin’s time, biologists have tried to figure out how natural chemical and physical processes could have assembled these chemicals into simple organisms somewhere in the seas or on the seashores of the early earth.

Water plays a crucial role in all these theories. Amino acids and nucleotides, once formed, could have been protected to some extent as long as they stayed in water. Both molecules can form naturally into long chains, though this process requires drier conditions. It is possible that such chains were formed in shallow coastal pools where dissolved molecules would have been periodically dried out and then dissolved again. Under the right conditions, chains of amino acids form proteins, while chains of nucleotides form nucleic acids. So, after millions of years, the seas of the early earth could have been full of simple organic chemicals, which could have joined together into more complex patterns. A. G. Cairns-Smith has suggested that in shallow water, tiny crystals of clay may have provided a template for the formation of more complex molecules.17 Here, electrostatic forces may have held atoms in complex patterns governed by the molecular structure of the clay itself, until eventually they began to link together in new ways. It is even possible that crystals of clay, sitting inside early cells, played some of the roles of modern DNA by providing templates that could be used over and over again to produce the chemicals used in the metabolism of their host cells.

However they were created, early organic molecules could have formed a weak organic “soup” of simple proteins, nucleic acids, and other organic molecules. Such molecules have a natural tendency to form simple membranes or “skins” made of phospholipids and to form into small globules, “like drops of oil in a vinaigrette sauce.”18 Some of these molecules can also absorb chemicals through their skins in a process analogous to eating, which provides them with the energy needed to expand and absorb more chemicals. Furthermore, when they grow too large and ungainly, such molecules simply split into parts, each of which then goes its own way, just as large water drops on an oily surface can split into smaller droplets. So, along the shores and in the warm seas of the earth 4 billion years ago, there may already have existed organic molecules that duplicated many of the activities of life. They formed into cell-like globules with an outer skin; they “ate” other chemicals; and they could split into separate globules as if reproducing.

All these theories are plausible, but none can explain all the steps leading from nonlife to life. And there are problems with the “warm pond” theory, including the fact that the early atmosphere may not have been as favorable to organic evolution as Miller and Urey had supposed—particularly if, as some evidence suggests, the earliest living organisms appeared before 3.8 billion years ago, when the earth’s surface was still being bombarded regularly by extraterrestrial material. Recent research has offered some promising new approaches to the problem, as it has revealed the existence of previously unknown forms of bacteria, the archaebacteria, that evolved well below the surface of Earth.19 Like all prokaryotes (the simplest type of single-celled organisms), archaebacteria have no nucleus. But unlike most prokaryotes, which extract energy either from sunlight or from other cells, archaebacteria “feed” on chemical energy produced within the earth. They can extract energy from iron, sulfur, hydrogen, and many other unlikely chemicals that are buried in rocks or dissolved in seawater. Archaebacteria can live comfortably deep below the surface of the earth, even under extremely high temperatures and pressures, so their existence raises the possibility that life originated not on but well below the surface of planets. In the 1990s, archaebacteria were found living inside rocks more than a kilometer below the earth’s surface; and they have been found living at temperatures well above boiling point in volcanic vents on the seafloor, as well as in porous rocks below the seabed. In 2001, they were found in a huge region that researchers described as a “lost city” on the seabed, where heat was generated not by volcanic activity but by chemical reactions associated with the exposure of a green rock known as olivine to seawater. Such areas may have been common early in the earth’s history.20 But archaebacteria also live in huge quantities at the earth’s surface. They have been studied, for example, in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Finally, the extreme habitats they occupy suggest the possibility that life may exist, or may once have existed, on neighboring planets and moons, for similar habitats may well exist elsewhere in our solar system.

There are several reasons for supposing that archaebacteria offer a better model than most other modern organisms for the earliest forms of life on Earth. Archaebacteria live in environments that have changed little since the Hadean era. And their ability to live well below the surface means that they would have been less affected by the meteoritic impacts that were common early in the earth’s history and may have periodically wiped out life near the surface. They would also have been protected from changes in the earth’s atmosphere, and from the heavy doses of ultraviolet radiation that bombarded the early earth before the appearance of an ozone layer. Though the habitats of heat-loving archaebacteria may seem forbidding to us, they may have been the best place for early organisms to establish themselves. These environments contained plenty of chemical food to produce organic material of the kind generated in the Miller-Urey experiments. Particularly around thermal vents, they also contained plenty of energy to drive multiple chemical reactions. Studies of the genetic material in archaebacteria also suggest that they have evolved far more slowly than most other surviving organisms. And, perhaps most striking, the oldest organisms of all, whether archaebacteria or ordinary bacteria, all appear to be heat-resistant. This suggests that however we classify the earliest organisms on earth, they were probably heat-loving organisms that evolved in the highly productive environments around deep ocean vents. If these arguments are right, then life may have appeared first beneath the surface of the earth and its seas, before producing new species that could survive in the cooler environments near or at the surface.21

The third task, to explain the origins of the genetic code, is even trickier than the previous two. In a sense this is the most fundamental problem of all, for the key to all modern forms of life appears to be a division of labor between nucleotides, which store and read the instructions for making an organism (the genome), and the proteins that use those instructions to construct each individual organism. Crudely speaking, nucleotides handle replication, while proteins handle metabolism. The distinction is almost exactly analogous to the distinction between hardware and software in computing. So, which evolved first, metabolism (chemical activity) or replication (the genetic code)—or did they evolve together?22

Oparin’s theory implied that metabolism came first and accurate mechanisms of replication evolved later. This idea is intuitively plausible, on the grounds that hardware can exist without software but not the other way around. In Oparin’s theory, the earliest organisms were bags of chemicals that could reproduce in a rough-and-ready way, and even “evolve.” And they may have evolved in quite complex ways. Many people find it difficult to understand how random processes of this kind can generate complexity. However, evolutionary processes, even of a crude sort, are not in fact entirely random. Of all the chemical experiments conducted randomly in the early earth, some would have created more stable by-products than others. So the process of assembling early molecules did not necessarily begin from scratch each time. On the contrary, every time a relatively stable molecule was produced, it was likely to survive, thereby becoming, in turn, the basis for further experiments. As Cesare Emiliani points out, the odds of a monkey typing the entire Bible by tapping away randomly for millions of years are almost infinitely low. But if a rule is added saying that each time a correct letter is typed it is locked into position, then the odds change radically, and we can expect a Bible to be produced within a decade.23 To put it slightly differently, we can say that the organic chemicals of the early earth were already subject to the laws of evolution. Most chemicals vanished, but those well adapted to their environment were likely to get “locked in.” The few that survived long enough had offspring, and all later generations were their descendants. In this brutal way, the environment “selected” those chemicals best able to survive and reproduce.

And there are many reasons to suppose that chemical evolution of this kind may be quite a powerful mechanism of change. For example, some scientists speculate that there exist deep mechanisms that encourage organization where we might expect pure randomness.24 In certain types of chemical reactions, a particular chemical may catalyze, or stimulate, its own production, in a process known as autocatalysis. Bring together a sufficient number of chemicals of this type and, eventually, there is likely to be a runaway reaction, rather like bringing together a critical mass of uranium in a bomb. Once the critical mass has been reached, these chemical chain reactions can form extremely complex structures very quickly. If this (essentially mathematical) logic is correct, then it suggests that the construction of the large and complex chemicals that were the earliest life-forms may be a natural tendency of organic chemistry. If so, then wherever in the universe conditions allow large amounts of organic chemicals to form and interact, life may be a near certainty.

But all forms of evolution require reasonably accurate mechanisms for replication; otherwise, even the most successful traits will be lost over time. So even theories that put metabolism first have to explain what mechanisms of replication existed in the early days. And this is not easy. DNA, the key to the genetic code in all living organisms today (except for a few viruses), is a fantastically complex molecule, containing billions of atoms. Untwisted, a single molecule of human DNA would be almost two meters long. The atoms of DNA are arranged in precise patterns that, like a piece of software, contain all the information needed to create a living organism. Every cell of our body contains a complete set of these instructions, though it uses only a tiny portion of its DNA instruction manual. These instructions are selected and triggered by the particular environment in which it finds itself. Thus, different parts of the code are used by brain cells and bone cells.

A DNA molecule consists of two long chains of nucleotides that are linked together by rungs, like a ladder. The ladder is then twisted into a long helix, like a spiral staircase. Each section of the ladder has attached to it one of four simple clusters of atoms known as bases. Each base can link with only one of the other four, and thus each rung of the ladder consists of two linked bases in a strict order. Adenine (A) links only with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) with guanine (G). The order in which these bases appear on each side contains the code for manufacturing the proteins from which organisms are constructed. Each group of three bases codes for a particular amino acid. Special molecules periodically unzip a part of the DNA spiral, and read off the order of bases in groups of three. Elsewhere in the cell, these amino acids are assembled into chains to make the thousands of proteins that drive chemical reactions and form structures within the cell. DNA can also replicate itself. First, the entire double helix splits down the middle like a zipper as the two bases that make up each rung of the ladder separate. Then, each base attracts a counterpart from the surrounding environment, A joining with T and C with G, until each half of the original helix has built up an entirely new, complementary chain. In this way, a single molecule of DNA can form two new molecules, each more or less identical to the parent molecule.

Explaining how this complex, elaborate, and elegant mechanism was constructed is one of the most challenging tasks facing modern biological theory. One problem is that DNA appears to be helpless on its own. Like any software, it is useless without hardware. So it is difficult to imagine how it could have evolved independently. But there are also problems with the notion that metabolism (the “hardware”) evolved first—in particular, it is hard to see how rough-and-ready evolutionary processes could generate a high level of complexity. If cells reproduce without much precision, then the mechanism Emiliani describes simply doesn’t work as well. Even if a complex organism evolves, the blueprint for it is likely to get blurred in later generations. For this reason, many who have struggled with these issues have insisted that life cannot achieve significantly new levels of complexity without a capacity to replicate more precisely. And that leads us back to the argument, despite its difficulties, that perhaps the genetic code came before complex metabolism.

What gave such theories a boost in the 1960s was the discovery that DNA’s close cousin, RNA, is less helpless than DNA. RNA is software and can, like DNA, code information. But it exists in only a single strand, which means that it can also fold up like a protein and engage in metabolic activities. So, it can play both of the roles of life; it can reproduce itself and provide the set of instructions for reproducing. It can be both hardware and software. Perhaps the first molecules that replicated accurately enough to have some form of “heredity” were made from RNA. Indeed, some viruses even today use RNA instead of DNA as the basis for their genome.

The discovery that RNA can act as hardware as well as software gave rise to theories suggesting that RNA was the earliest form of life. In these theories, associated with the work of Manfred Eigen and Leslie Orgel, the genetic code evolved first, before complex metabolism, even before cells.25 Unfortunately, RNA copies itself less accurately than DNA, and this ereates real problems. A system of replication that is good but not quite good enough may be the worst of all possible worlds, because it may be bad enough to accumulate errors and good enough to transmit those errors faithfully to later generations. It has been shown that such a system may lead to breakdown more rapidly than the sloppier forms of replication required in “metabolism first” models of the origins of life. (Manfred Eigen, the great champion of RNA, has described this problem, ruefully, as the “error catastrophe.”)26

Freeman Dyson has suggested that perhaps these two theories can be combined.27 Perhaps metabolism did indeed come first, and cells without a precise mechanism for replication dominated life on earth for many millions of years, managing, despite their limitations, to evolve many metabolic processes that still occur inside modern cells. One of these processes, present in all living organisms today, involves the storing of energy inside a molecule known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). And this, as it happens, is closely related to another molecule that is a crucial component of RNA. So perhaps RNA evolved within such cells, which might have provided a more benign environment than the outside world for their evolution. Eventually, acting as a sort of parasite, RNA may have hijacked the reproductive mechanisms of the cell until, in an early form of symbiosis, the cell and its parasitic RNA reached a compromise under which the cell focused on metabolism and the RNA on reproduction. With more accurate mechanisms of replication available (if the “error catastrophe” could somehow be avoided), the RNA in such cells might eventually have evolved into DNA, which is a close relative of RNA.

Or perhaps life as we know it emerged through a symbiosis between two rather different types of organisms, one of which was good at metabolism and the other at coding. Something like this division of labor still exists today between bacteria and the many different viruslike entities that float between them (see chapter 5). Bacteria often use free-floating bits of software similar to viruses for their own purposes, while entities like viruses exploit the metabolic powers of bacteria and other organisms to reproduce. We can imagine a very early world in which metabolizers used viruslike organs to steady their own mechanisms of replication, while virus-type organisms used bacteria to do their metabolism for them, until eventually the two merged to form single organisms.

If none of these theories is totally persuasive, we should not be surprised. There doesn’t yet exist a complete theory of the origins of life. In explaining the origins of the genetic code, the key to the emergence of really complex organisms, we are still in difficult territory. However, progress has been rapid in recent decades, and ongoing research holds out the promise that a more satisfactory story may appear within the next decade or two.





SUMMARY




Darwin’s theory of evolution, as modified in the twentieth century, provides the fundamental organizing idea of the modern life sciences. Darwin argued that slight random variations within species explain why some individuals are more likely to reproduce than others. Those individuals that are slightly better adapted to their environment are slightly more likely to survive into adulthood and produce healthy offspring, so they are more likely to pass their genes on to later generations. In this way, by what he called “natural selection,” species slowly change, and over time entirely new species can be formed.

Such processes may also have shaped the organic chemicals that floated in space, on the earth’s surface, and below its surface in the early days of the earth’s history. As the more “successful” and stable of these forms survived, over billions of generations more and more stable and complex organic chemicals appeared, through a chemical form of natural selection. In this way, the earliest living organisms were created, within less than a billion years of the formation of our earth. These organisms were the ancestors of all modern life-forms.

Darwin is one of the few founders of modern scientific thought whose own writings are worth reading. On the Origin of Species (1859; reprint, 1968) is still readable today; and Steve Jones has offered a modern update in Almost Like a Whale (2000). Armand Delsemme’s Our Cosmic Origins (1998) offers a quick introduction, as do many good modern textbooks on biology and evolution. In recent years, biology has generated a superb literature for the general, nonspecialist reader. The writings of Stephen Jay Gould on evolution are always worth reading, even when he does not take a mainstream position. Daniel Dennett’s Darwin’s Dangerous Idea (1995) is a modern classic, while Ernst Mayr (One Long Argument [1991]) and John Maynard Smith (The Theory of Evolution [3rd ed., 1975]) offer slightly older accounts. There are several good books on modern attempts to explain the origins of life. Paul Davies, The Fifth Miracle (1999), is one of the most recent and most accessible. Erwin Schrödinger, What Is Life? (1944; reprint, 1992), is still worth reading, and is updated in Freeman Dyson’s Origins of Life (2nd ed., 1999). A. G. Cairns-Smith’s Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (1985) and Robert Shapiro’s Origins (1986) are good, accessible discussions. The writings of Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan offer an immensely readable introduction to a view of life that emphasizes the role of bacteria (the “microcosmos”; see especially Microcosmos [1987]). Eric Chaisson (Cosmic Evolution [2001], The Life Era [1987], Universe [1988]), Stuart Kauffman (At Home in the Universe [1995]), and Roger Lewin (Complexity [1993], Human Evolution [4th ed., 1999]) discuss notions of complexity and their role in modern discussions of life.
