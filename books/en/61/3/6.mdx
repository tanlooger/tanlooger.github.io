title: CHAPTER 6 THE EVOLUTION OF HUMANS
---






The rest of this book will be concerned mainly with the history of just one species, Homo sapiens. There are two justifications for narrowing the focus in this way The first is that we—the author and readers of this book—belong to this species. To know ourselves, we must know the history of Homo sapiens. The second reason, less obvious and less parochial, is that the history of our species is significant at some surprisingly large scales.

When we try to explain the appearance of human beings, we face once again the paradox of beginnings. How can something utterly new appear? We are animals, we evolved according to Darwinian rules as did any other living organism, and we are remarkably similar to closely related species, such as the other hominoids (the great apes). Yet we are also radically different from even our closest relatives. Somehow or other, our species has moved beyond the Darwinian rules. And this is why our impact on the earth has been far greater than that of any other large organism.

How can we explain both what unites us to other animals and what divides us from them?





HUMAN HISTORY: A NEW LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY




We have seen similar transitions before. Human history marks the sudden and unexpected emergence of a new level of complexity, as did the first appearance of stars, of life on Earth, or of multicelled organisms. We have seen that complex entities are rarer than less complex entities, they are more fragile, and, because they have to climb faster up entropy’s down escalator (see appendix 2), they have to manage denser energy flows. We have also seen that transitions to greater complexity come about through the creation of new forms of interdependence, as entities that once existed more or less independently are incorporated within new and larger structures. Finally, we have seen that as new levels of complexity have appeared, they seem to operate according to new rules (“emergent properties,” in the jargon of complexity theory).

Human history also marks the emergence of a new level of complexity on Earth.1 As with earlier transitions, human history links once-independent entities into larger patterns of interdependence; and this process is associated with greater energy flows that have a profound transformative effect. From the perspective of the twenty-first century, we can measure some of these changes. Humans, acting together, have learned how to manage increasingly large energy flows. Though the spectacular implications of these changes have become apparent only in the past two centuries, their roots lie deep in the Paleolithic era, or “Old Stone Age.”2

Table 6.1 shows how humans have learned to extract from their environment more than just the energy needed to survive and reproduce. They have shown an entirely new capacity for “ecological innovation.” From early in human history, skills such as the management of fire increased the amount of energy available per capita. In the past 10,000 years, agriculture has increased the food energy humans can extract from a given area, while the domestication of large herbivores in the past 6,000 years increased the amount of energy available for traction power as well. In the past two centuries, the use of fossil fuels has multiplied per capita energy use many times over. As the total number of humans has also increased from perhaps a few hundred thousand in the Paleolithic to a few million 10,000 years ago and more than 6 billion today (see figure 6.1), the total amount of energy controlled by our species has multiplied by at least 50,000 times. This is a staggering amount of energy to be under the command of a single species, and it helps explain why our species has had such an impact on the entire biosphere. A powerful way of measuring this impact is to estimate how much of the energy supplied to the biosphere from sunlight is co-opted for use by humans. Net primary productivity (NPP) is that portion of energy from sunlight that enters the food chain through photosynthesis and is turned into plant material. This, in turn, feeds most other organisms. NPP can thus be used as a rough measure of the biosphere’s energy “income.” Modern calculations suggest that our species is currently co-opting for its own use at least 25 percent, and by some measures 40 percent, of all the NPP available to land-based species. Paul Ehrlich sums up the story told by these remarkable figures: “One of many millions of species, Homo sapiens is now co-opting about a quarter of all the products of photosynthesis for its own use.”3

Increasing human control of energy has shaped human history and the histories of many other species as well. It has also enabled humans to multiply at an accelerating rate. Tables 6.2 and 6.3 and figure 6.1 summarize human population growth over the past 100,000 years. As human numbers have grown, so has the ecological range of our species; by 10,000 years ago, and perhaps as early as 30,000 years ago, humans could be found living in all continents apart from Antarctica. In the Paleolithic era, human history was characterized mainly by the increasing range of human settlement. In the past 10,000 years, the increasing density of human settlement has been the main shaper of human social evolution, as humans learned how to live in larger and larger communities, from villages to towns, cities, and states.

TABLE 6.1. HUMAN PER CAPITA ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE (UNITS OF ENERGY = 1,000 CALORIES PER DAY)





Resources used by humans are, by definition, unavailable to other species. So, as human numbers have risen, other species have felt the pinch. Domesticates such as sheep and cattle, and unintentional domesticates from cockroaches to rats, have flourished. But many more species have fared less well, and an alarming number have died out. That process also began in the Paleolithic, when human activity helped drive to extinction close relatives such as Neanderthals, as well as many other large species, including mammoths in Siberia, horses and giant sloths in the Americas, and giant worn-bats and kangaroos in Australia. Today, rates of extinction caused by human activity have accelerated. Currently, 1,096 of 4,629 mammal species (24 percent) are thought to be “threatened.” as are 1,107 of 9,627 bird species (11 percent), 253 of 6,900 reptile species (4 percent), 124 of 4,522 amphibian species (3 percent), 734 of 25,000 fish species (3 percent), and 25,971 of 270,000 higher plant species (10 percent).4 And because the pace of extinctions is accelerating, we can expect many more species to vanish in the near future. These figures provide a powerful measure of the planetary impact of human history, for paleontologists have surveyed rates of extinction over much of the past 600 million years, and the current rates appear similar to those of the five or six most drastic extinction eras during that time span.5 This means that the impact of human history will be visible on scales of at least a billion years. In other words, if interstellar paleontologists visit this planet in one billion years’ time and try to decipher the history of the planet using the tools of contemporary human paleontologists, they will identify a major extinction event that coincides with the presence of our species.

These figures also help us gauge the uniqueness of human history. No other large animal species has multiplied like humans, or occupied such a wide range, or controlled such vast ecological resources. (Once again, the possible exceptions are species such as cattle or rabbits that have multiplied as part of the human ecological team.) Our history is utterly different even from that of our closest relatives, the chimps. Though they are extremely close to us genetically, physically, socially, and intellectually, we have no evidence that their numbers, the range they occupy, or their technologies have changed greatly during the past 100,000 years. Indeed, that is precisely why humans can be said to have had a “history,” while the very idea of chimps having one seems slightly bizarre. Most animal species don’t have histories as we usually use the word; once they have evolved, they tend to remain within their original niche until they vanish from the fossil record. Whole families or orders of species, such as the dinosaurs or mammals, can be said to have histories, because different species within these groups can evolve in many different ways and thus the numbers, the ranges, and the ecological “technologies” of whole families of animals do change. But the same is not normally true of single species. Humans have multiplied and diversified their behaviors in ways that are characteristic not of single species but of entire families or orders of animals—and they have done so in an astonishingly short period.

TABLE 6.3. GROWTH RATES IN DIFFERENT HISTORICAL ERAS





Clearly a fundamental threshold of some kind was crossed with the appearance of our species. Human history marks the appearance of new rules of historical change. So, to focus on human history is not just a matter of genealogical vanity. The appearance of our species marks a significant turning point in the history of our planet. As A. J. McMichael writes: “Each species is an experiment of Nature. Only one such experiment, Homo sapiens, has evolved in a way that has enabled its biological adaptation to be complemented by a capacity for cumulative cultural adaptation. This unprecedented combination of the usual biologically-based drive for short-term gain (food, territory and sexual consummation) with an intellectual capacity to satisfy that drive via increasingly complex cultural practices is what distinguishes the human ‘experiment.’”6





EXPLAINING THE APPEARANCE OF HUMANS




Over the years, many “prime movers” have been proposed to explain the transition to humanity. These range from bipedalism, which freed our dexterous hands for toolmaking (Darwin’s preferred answer), to hunting and meat eating, to large brains, to human languages. The explanation that follows focuses on the importance of human language, but allocates supporting roles to some of these other factors.

A somewhat abstract explanation is implicit in the preceding paragraphs. All species adapt to their environments, but most have only one or two adaptive tricks in their repertoire. In contrast, humans seem to constantly develop new ecological tricks, new ways of extracting resources from their environments. In the jargon of economists, humans seem to have a highly developed capacity for “innovation.” And they innovated not on the Darwinian scale of hundreds of thousands or millions of years, but on a scale ranging from thousands of years to decades and even less time. Our challenge is to explain how, when, and why human beings acquired their new level of ecological creativity. If we can explain this vastly enhanced capacity, we will have gone a long way toward explaining what is distinctive about human history.

We have seen that the emergence of new forms of complexity always involves the creation of large structures within which previously independent entities are locked into new forms of interdependence and new rules of cooperation.7 Following this hint, we should expect to find that the transition to human history is primarily marked not by a change in the nature of humans as individuals but rather by a change in the way individuals relate to each other. This suggests that we should focus not just on changes in the genes, the physiology, or the brains of earlier forms of humans but also on changes in the ways our ancestors interacted.

Like many other transitions of this kind, the emergence of our species was quite sudden. On the paleontological scale, it was an almost instantaneous event. This means that we should expect to find a single trigger. In star formation, temperatures rise over long periods until suddenly a trigger is released when hydrogen starts to fuse. So with human evolution: adaptive skills that may have evolved over many millions of years were suddenly transformed when a threshold of some kind was crossed. How can we describe this threshold? It clearly has something to do with an enhanced capacity to learn. Many animals learn, from flatworms to toads. But most of what most animals learn is lost when they die. Of course, some teaching goes on. Chimp mothers teach their children to crack nuts or fish for termites by demonstrating how to do it. And the infants, in time, may teach their children. But we know of no animal that can describe what to do in the abstract—no animal that could explain how to fish for termites without giving a demonstration, or give an account of a pathway without walking along it; and we certainly know of no animal that could describe abstract entities such as gods or quarks or pink elephants. The past and future, too, are abstractions, for only the present can be experienced directly; thus animals without symbolic language may lack the ability humans have to deliberately think about the past and imagine the future. These are severe limitations. For many years, the primatologist Shirley Strum observed a troop of baboons in Kenya that she named the “Pumphouse Gang.” Compared to other troops, they were virtuoso hunters; they often ate meat as frequently as once a day. But they hunted most successfully when led by one particular male. And they had no way of storing his skills or knowledge once he was gone.8

Human language, however, allows more precise and efficient transmission of knowledge from brain to brain. That means that humans can share information with great precision, creating a common pool of ecological and technical knowledge, which in turn means that for humans, the benefits of cooperation increasingly tend to outweigh the benefits of competition. (John Mears has referred to humans as “highly networked creatures.”)9 Furthermore, the ecological knowledge contributed to that pool by each individual can survive long after his or her death. So knowledge and skills can accumulate nongenetically from generation to generation, and each individual has access to the stored knowledge of many previous generations. Thus what is distinctive about humans is that they can learn collectively. Cellular thinking (thinking that focuses on the individual) makes it hard to see this; but in explaining the distinctiveness of humans, we must learn to compare individual chimps not with individual humans (where the differences are significant but not transformative) but with entire groups of humans. We won’t understand the difference if we compare individual human brains with individual chimp brains; we will begin to comprehend it only if we compare individual chimp brains with the huge, collective brains created by millions of humans over many generations.

The possibility of learning collectively changes everything. McMichael writes:



The advent of cumulative culture is an unprecedented occurrence in nature. It acts like compound interest, allowing successive generations to start progressively further along the road of cultural and technological development. By traveling that road, the human species has, in general, become increasingly distanced from its ecological roots. The transmission of knowledge, ideas and technique between generations has given humans an extra, and completely unprecedented, capacity for surviving in unfamiliar environments and for creating new environments that meet immediate needs and wants.10





Collective learning is what gives humans a history, because it means that the ecological skills available to humans have changed over time. And there is a clear directionality to this process. Over time, processes of collective learning ensure that humans as a species will get better at extracting resources from the environment, and their increasing ecological skills ensure that, over time, human populations will increase. Generalizations about collective learning cannot predict the exact timing or geography of such processes, of course, nor how far they are likely to proceed, nor their detailed consequences; but such generalizations can tell us something about the long-term shape of human history on large timescales.

To get a feeling for the power of collective learning, it is enough to imagine life as it might be if we had to learn everything from scratch, receiving little more from family or community than hints about appropriate social behavior and eating habits, which is more or less the intellectual heritage of young chimps. How many of the artifacts around us (each of which embodies stored knowledge) could we invent or construct in a lifetime? Asking such questions is a powerful reminder of the extraordinary extent to which our lives as individuals depend on the accumulated knowledge of millions of other humans over many generations. Humans as individuals are not that much cleverer than chimps or Neanderthals; but as a species we are vastly more creative because our knowledge is shared within and between generations. All in all, collective learning is so powerful an adaptive mechanism that one might argue it plays a role in human history analogous to that of natural selection in the histories of other organisms.

Why can humans learn collectively? Because of the distinctive nature of human language. Human language is more “open” than nonhuman forms of communication. It is open grammatically because its strict rules of grammar allow us to generate a nearly infinite number of meanings from a small number of linguistic elements, such as words. It is also open semantically—that is, it can convey a wider range of meanings—because it can refer not just to what is in front of us but also to entities that are not present, and even to entities that could never be present. By using symbols, we can gather large amounts of information stored in our memories into single blocks; then we can construct even larger conceptual structures with these symbolic building blocks. Symbols enable us to abstract from the concreteness of things—to refer, as it were, to the distilled “essence” of what is around us. But they can also refer to other symbols. So they can condense and store huge amounts of information, just as the symbolic tokens we call money offer a compact and efficient way of storing and exchanging abstract values.11 Symbolic languages let us store and share information that may have been accumulated during thousands or millions of lifetimes. All in all, symbolic language is a vastly more powerful data mover than are any presymbolic forms of communication. As Terrence Deacon has argued, presymbolic forms of communication “can only refer to something else by virtue of a concrete part-whole link with it, even if this has no more basis than just habitual coincidence. Although there is a vast universe of objects and relationships susceptible to nonsymbolic representation, indeed, anything that can be present to the senses, this does not include abstract or otherwise intangible objects of reference.”12

If this argument is on the right track, it suggests that to understand the evolution of modern humans, we need to explain the emergence of symbolic language. But it is important to note straightaway that there was nothing inevitable about this process. Unlike star formation, which was statistically predictable, given what we know of the workings of gravity and the strong and weak nuclear forces, biological change is more random and open-ended, which is why living organisms are much more varied than stars. The elements that eventually combined into our species came together erratically and haphazardly, and there was never any certainty that they would assemble themselves in this particular way. As late as 100,000 years ago, well after our species had appeared, human populations may have fallen to as few as 10,000 adults, which means that our species was as close to extinction as mountain gorillas are today.13 This statistic is a powerful reminder not merely of the haphazardness of evolutionary processes but also of the fragility of complex entities. The appearance of human beings on Earth was an extremely chancy business.





EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTS: CONSTRUCTING THE STORY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION




Creating a coherent and plausible account of human evolution has been one of the great achievements of twentieth-century science. But how has this story been constructed? Before we look more closely at the story of human evolution, we must examine the types of evidence and the sorts of arguments that have been used to assemble it.

The fossil evidence includes the bones of ancestral species as well as the remains they left behind: their tools, scraps of food, and the marks they made on bones or rocks. Modern paleontologists can glean a remarkable amount of information from a bone. A jawbone can do more than identify a species; the patterns of toothwear can tell us about an animal’s normal diet, and that can tell us about the environments it lived in and the way it exploited them. A skull can tell us about the intellectual capacities of a species. And the lower part of a skull can often tell us whether a species walked on two legs or four; with bipedal animals, the spine enters the skull from below, whereas in quadrupeds it enters from behind. A toe bone on its own indicates how an animal walked: if the big toe is separated from the other toes (as it is in most primates), we can be sure the foot was still used for grasping and not yet specialized for walking. Often, a few bones are all we find. But the bonanza of a more complete skeleton, such as Lucy (40 percent of whose skeleton was found by Don Johanson in Ethiopia in the early 1970s), tells us much more. Lucy and the remains found near her were about 3 to 3.5 million years old, and they offer detailed evidence of the physiology of at least one species of early humans from that era.

The remains of human activity are equally important. Most important of all have been discoveries of stone tools, partly because tools made of less durable materials—bark, bamboo, and so on—rarely survive. Microscopic analysis of the cutting edges of stone tools can tell us what they cut; analysis of where the stone came from can tell us whether their makers actively sought out particular raw materials from other areas; reconstruction of flakes from the sites where stone tools were made can tell us much about how they were made; and techniques of toolmaking can give us valuable hints about how our ancestors thought. Analysis of the bones of other animals from early human sites can tell us much about whether or not our ancestors ate meat, as well as how they hunted. For example, careful analysis of cut marks on bones has sometimes found signs of human butchering overlaid on the tooth marks of carnivorous animals. Presumably this means that early humans scavenged animals first killed by other predators. All these types of material evidence can also be dated, more or less accurately, using the increasing number of modern dating techniques. (On radiometric dating techniques, see appendix 1.)

But the fossil record is spotty; and until very recently, we had no fossils at all for the crucial period, from about 4 to 7 million years ago, when the hominines (the lineage leading to our own species) diverged from the lineage that leads to modern chimps. So other forms of evidence have to fill in the gaps. One of the most important in recent decades has been provided by molecular dating. As we saw in chapter 4, much evolutionary change is random. This is particularly true of those parts of a species’ genome that do not directly affect its survival chances, including the large amounts of “junk DNA” and the DNA contained in the mitochondria of all human cells. Genetic change in these parts of the genome is “neutral”—it doesn’t affect the developed organism. Change in junk DNA is thus like the shuffling of a vast deck of cards. Fortunately, random processes of this kind are subject to general statistical laws. If you take a new deck of cards arranged by suit and number and shuffle it a few times, a statistician can estimate roughly how often it has been shuffled by determining how much the pack differs from its original condition. The larger the number of cards and shuffles, the more precise and reliable such estimates can be.

In an article first published in 1967, two biochemists working in the United States, Vincent Sarich and Alan Wilson, argued that much genetic change is subject to similar rules.14 Thus, if we take two modern species and calculate the differences between their DNA sequences, we can estimate pretty well when their two lines diverged from a common ancestor. In this way, the evolution of DNA can provide a sort of genetic clock. The idea was ridiculed at first, partly because many took it as a fundamental tenet of natural selection that all evolutionary change was adaptive, which should have implied that changes did not occur in statistically predictable ways. However, it is now agreed that much change is indeed random—and in any case, the results of such dating methods have turned out to fit remarkably well with many other types of evidence. Genetic comparisons of this kind are now made and used routinely to understand the relationship between different species, though some problems remain. For example, it is clear that not all genetic change occurs with the regularity necessary if it is to be used as a clock. But these methods can be extremely valuable for many purposes, particularly in the study of human evolution.15

The first thing Sarich and Wilson showed was that, genetically speaking, we are closer to chimpanzees than was once thought. In the 1970s, it was widely believed that the two lines leading to humans and apes had diverged at least 15 million, and perhaps as much as 30 million years ago—a comfortable distance for those unhappy at the thought of close kinship with chimps. Yet the DNA of modern humans differs from that of our nearest living relatives by only about 1.6 percent. That is to say, 98.4 percent of our DNA is identical to that of modern chimpanzees. This means that all the variation between our history and that of chimps must be explained with reference to the 1.6 percent of our genetic material that is different from that of chimps. Comparisons of the rate of genetic change of mammals were possible because it was known that mammal species had diverged rapidly from each other rabout 65 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were driven to extinction. But it turned out that humans and chimps differed from each other only by about 10 percent as much as the differences between major groups of mammals, which suggested that they had diverged from each other approximately 5 to 7 million years ago. This implies that at the time of that divergence, there lived an animal that was the ancestor of both modern humans and modern chimps, though it would have looked different from either of these living species. The thinness of the fossil record in this period means that we can say little about this ancestral being.16 But we can be sure that such an animal existed—otherwise we would not exist! Similar arguments suggest that humans and gorillas had a common ancestor 8 to 10 million years ago, and humans and orangutans about 13 to 16 million years ago.

We also know a lot about the environments in which our hominine ancestors evolved, based on analyses of changing climates and plant and animal remains. In the past few million years, global climates were dominated by the erratic and unpredictable climatic changes of the ice ages (see chapter 5). These changes altered habitats and environments, which favored species that were highly adaptable and able to use a wider variety of ecological niches. Generalist or “weedy” species that can adapt well to ecological disruption, such as modern humans, may have been typical products of the ice ages.17

In combination, these various techniques enable us to describe the physical evolution of hominines and the environments they lived in, but describing behavior is much trickier. Fossils can tell us something about lifeways; but to go further, we have to rely on modern analogies with other species that may have lived similarly. Researchers in recent decades, beginning with Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, have studied the lives of great apes in the wild, and we now know a lot about how they live and about their social, sexual, and political relations.18 Such studies can suggest how early hominines may have lived; but they can also mislead us, for different types of ape, and even different communities of a given type of ape, can live in different ways. For example, Pan troglodytes, the most familiar species of chimp, lives in communities dominated by closely related males, which are joined by females from other communities. Males form hierarchies, but these are changeable, and females may mate with several males, circumstances that make the sexual and political life of such communities extremely complex. Gorillas, in contrast, usually live in smaller groups of several females, with one or perhaps two males. Orangutans are for the most part solitary, coming together only to mate. So deciding exactly what analogies with primate societies can tell us about the societies of early hominines is not easy.

The same is true of the other analogy that has been extremely influential in studies of hominine evolution: the analogy with modern “foraging” societies.19 Anthropologists constantly remind paleontologists that modern foraging societies are very modern—all have been influenced in some way by modern society. So building theories about hominine or early human social structure on these analogies may be risky. Nevertheless, because the technologies and the social structures of modern foraging societies are certainly closer to those of early humans than are those of a modern urban community, the anthropologists’ warnings are routinely ignored. Modern studies, such as those of the San peoples of southern Africa, have helped us construct plausible models of how early hominines and humans hunted, how males and females related to each other, and what sort of power games may have been played. Perhaps most important, they have reminded us that societies that seem simple to modern city dwellers were, in their own ways, both complex and sophisticated. After all, it was no mean task to live successfully for thousands of years, in the deserts of southern Africa or Australia, or in the Siberian tundra, using Stone Age technologies.

Finally, modern understanding of how other species have evolved has been used to construct models of how humans may have evolved. For example, it is quite common to find that a new species evolves that is remarkably like the immature individuals in the species from which it has evolved. This process is called neoteny, and it occurs through minor alterations in the genetic switches that control the life cycle of a species. Such changes can launch a cascade of secondary and tertiary effects that cause significant evolutionary change. It has been argued that in many respects, humans are more like young chimps than like adult chimps; this similarity implies that we may have evolved, in part, through some form of neoteny, while modern chimps may have remained more like the adults of our common ancestor. Equally, modern evolutionary research has shown that evolution often occurs in fits and starts. If a new niche appears, perhaps as a result of climatic change, it is often filled quite rapidly (“rapidly” in evolutionary terms, which means in a few hundred thousand or even a few million years) with a large number of quite similar species, most of which may then get weeded out, leaving only one or two surviving lines. This process is known as an adaptive radiation, and each radiation seems to be associated, roughly speaking, with a particular ecological trick. Among our ancestral species, as we will see, there seems to have been several adaptive radiations, each of which, we can now recognize, added something new to the package that became us.20

All these types of evidence have been used to construct the modern account of how humans evolved. That account is far from perfect, but it is far richer and is based on far more evidence than the accounts of even ten years ago.





PRIMATE AND HOMININE RADIATIONS




I have argued that the evolution of symbolic language may mark the critical threshold that leads to human history. But symbolic language could not have made such a difference if our ancestors had not had other qualities that enabled them to exploit the advantages that it bestowed. Among the most important of these preadaptations are sociability, preexisting linguistic skills, bipedalism and dexterous hands, meat eating and hunting, a long period of childhood learning, and large forebrains. Here, we will try to trace the haphazard processes by which these various elements evolved and combined in the package of features that makes up our species.





Primate Heritage




We share many of the features named above with other primates.21 Most primates have been tree dwellers. Animals that live in trees have to be able to see well, or they fall out. So all primates have good, stereoscopic vision. Smell is less important, much less important than it is for dogs, which is why most primates have smallish snouts and flattish faces. Visual information, in a complex, three-dimensional environment, requires considerable processing, so most primates have largish brains in comparison to their body size, and the primate line as a whole has been characterized by increasing relative brain size. Larger brains usually imply longer lives—perhaps because they imply greater dependence on learning, and learning improves with age (in principle). Tree dwelling also requires dexterity, so most primates have hands and feet that can grip and manipulate objects well. In practice, this means that their thumbs and big toes can be opposed to their other fingers and toes. Tree dwelling also encourages a greater specialization of labor between front and back limbs than is normal for ground-dwelling species. Though most primates can grip with both their feet and hands, the hindlimbs tend to specialize in locomotion while the forelimbs specialize in gripping.

Humans belong to a particular group of Old World primates known as the Hominoidea. This includes humans and the apes—chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons—as well as all their now-extinct ancestors. The oldest fossils classified within this superfamily of organisms are just over 20 million years old, which means they appear early in what geologists call the Miocene era (ca. 23–5.2 million years ago). These remains belong to a species known as Proconsul.22 Though the hominoids probably evolved in Africa, from as early as 18 million years ago hominoid remains also turn up in the southern parts of the Eurasian landmass, from France to Indonesia. The hominoids were a diverse group, and for a time they may have been more numerous than other species of Old World monkeys. Their migrations provide a typical example of an adaptive radiation.

The fossil record is not well-enough defined for us to be sure which were the evolutionary tricks that best define the hominoids, though increasing size, greater manual dexterity, larger brains, and a willingness to move away from tree cover may be among them. These are all features that we share with the remaining members of this superfamily of primates.





Bipedalism and the First Hominines




The Homininae are a subfamily of the family of Hominidae, the great apes. The hominines include only our own immediate ancestors. Their story begins at the transition from the Miocene to the Pliocene eras, between 5 and 6 million years ago. The construction of that story begins with the realization, based on molecular dating techniques, that about 6 million years ago, there existed somewhere in Africa an animal that was the ancestor of both modern chimps and modern humans. Since then, in a series of adaptive radiations, a large number of different species of hominines has appeared—perhaps as many as twenty or thirty. Whereas thirty years ago the difficulty was to find any hominine remains, today the difficulty is to decide which of the many species we now know of lies on the line that evolved into modern humans.

For a modern paleontologist, the holy grail is to find the remains of the species from which both chimps and humans are descended. And it is possible that this species, or something close to it, has already turned up. In 2000, a team of French and Kenyan archaeologists, working north of Nairobi, found the remains of a creature about 6 million years old, which was promptly dubbed “Millennium Man” in the press.23 But its true status remains uncertain. Its appearance is sufficiently apelike that many paleontologists have placed it on the chimp rather than the hominine side of the great divide between our two species. Similar criticisms have been leveled at another possible candidate for the oldest hominine, Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba, some remains of which were found by an American team of archaeologists in the Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia, as reported in the journal Nature in July 2001.24 These remains have been dated to between 5.2 and 5.8 million years ago. They include a toe bone, whose shape suggests that this creature walked on two legs. At present, most paleontologists are agreed that the decisive feature distinguishing hominines from apes is bipedalism: all known species of hominines are bipedal, while no known species of apes are (though chimps can stand for short periods).25 So the determination of whether these early specimens were really bipedal or not will be crucial; for now, the evidence is equivocal.

Debate over the significance of these finds is complicated by the fact that no one is quite sure why bipedalism evolved, though there have been many theories.26 Some focus on the role of climatic change. Twenty million years ago, the African continent was relatively flat, and its equatorial regions were covered fairly evenly with tropical forest. But beginning about 15 million years ago, the African tectonic plate began to tear in half. Tectonic activity along the Great Rift Valley has created a chain of highlands and rift valleys running north and south along the eastern part of the continent. By splitting open the earth’s crust, the rift valleys have provided a happy hunting ground for fossil hunters. But it was the mountains that may explain the presence of hominine fossils here, for they cast a huge rain shadow over the eastern parts of the continent, making it drier than the lands to the west. Yves Coppens has argued that this aridity drove some species into less-forested landscapes, where they had to move greater distances between stands of trees in order to find the types of foods to which they were accustomed. This might have encouraged the evolution of a more upright stance, for the knuckle-walking characteristic of chimps is not a good way of traveling over long distances. Unfortunately for this promising theory, some of the most recent early hominine fossils, including those of Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba, have turned up in environments that were probably forested.27

Perhaps bipedalism enabled hominines to see potential predators from a greater distance in open country. Or perhaps it was more energy-efficient than the knuckle-walking typical of chimps, and enabled early hominines to search for food over larger areas. Or perhaps walking upright in unshaded environments provided some protection from the midday sun by limiting the area of skin exposed to direct sunlight. These and other pressures would have favored those individuals that found it easiest to walk upright. (The last argument may also explain why hominines, at some point in their evolution, became less hairy than the other great apes.) Comparisons with chimps are suggestive, for as Coppens points out, chimps try to stand in three situations: “to see farther, to defend themselves or to launch an attack—since standing up frees their hands and allows them to throw stones—and to carry food to their offspring.”28

Whatever the causes of bipedalism, the fossil evidence, thin as it is, shows that within 2 million years, a number of bipedal species had appeared. These include the species known as Ardipithecus ramidus ramidus, whose remains were found in Ethiopia in 1994 and dated to ca. 4.4 million years ago. These early hominine species constitute the first major adaptive radiation in the history of hominines, and their success is probably associated with the advantages of bipedalism, whatever they were.





Australopithecines




The next two hominine radiations are associated with a group of species that paleontologists refer to as australopithecines.

All australopithecines were bipedal. We know this from the structure of the pelvis, the relative length of arms and legs, and the entry point of the spine into the skull (from below rather than from behind). The oldest of several species of australopithecines known at present is Australopithecus anamensis, a species whose remains were found in the Lake Turkana region in northern Kenya in 1995. These have been dated to ca. 4.2 million years BP.29 The best-known australopithecine fragments were found in Ethiopia in the 1970s by the American paleontologist Don Johanson. He found 40 percent of the skeleton of a bipedal female that he christened Lucy (reportedly after the song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’’). Lucy was about 1.1 meters tall, though other remains found nearby were up to 1.5 meters tall. All these remains were between 3 and 3.7 million years old; they are normally classified as members of the species Australopithecus afarensis, so named after the Afar valley in Ethiopia, where they were found.30 In 1998, in South Africa, an even more complete australopithecine skeleton was found along with its skull. This has been dated to between 2.5 and 3.5 million BP. The famous Laetoli footprints found by Mary Leakey may have been even older, for they date from at least 3.5 to 3.7 million years BP. These were made by three australopithecines, two of whom walked side by side, while a third walked in the steps of the leader. They apparently held hands as they walked through what may still have been hot volcanic ash. These astonishing footprints confirm directly what other fossil remains suggest indirectly: the oldest-known hominines were bipedal. In 1995, archaeologists working in Chad, well to the west of the Great Rift Valley, discovered the remains of a new species, Australopithecus bahrelghazali, which seems to have lived between 3 and 3.5 million years ago. Clearly, australopithecines lived on both sides of the Great Rift Valley. The several hundred individual australopithecines whose remains have been found in this century thus occupied a large area, reaching from Ethiopia to Chad to South Africa.

Though australopithecines walked on two legs, close study of their anatomy and particularly their hands has shown that they remained well adapted to life in the trees, and their walking was not yet as efficient as that of modern humans. Even more important, they had small brains, ranging in size from ca. 380 to 450 cubic centimeters. This contrasts with the 300 to 400 cubic centimeters of modern chimps, and an average brain size of 1,350 cubic centimeters for modern humans. The first distinguishing feature of the hominine line was not braininess but bipedalism (see figure 6.2).

There is strong reason to think that our own lineage can be traced back to early forms of australopithecines. But there also appeared, in a quite distinct radiation, a second group of australopithecines that, in the language of paleontology, were more “robust”-looking than afarensis. These existed between 3 and perhaps as late as 1 million years ago and are sometimes assigned to a separate genus, Paranthropus. What was distinctive about them, and marks them out as a different evolutionary line from us, is that they evolved exceptionally strong jaws for the grinding of tough, fibrous plant foods. They therefore had heavyset skulls with flamboyant crests that provided anchors for powerful chewing muscles.

What can we say about the lifeways of australopithecines? If we start with diets, it seems likely that most australopithecines depended mainly on the types of foods their ancestors had eaten in forested environments. Their teeth are adapted for grinding the shells of tough or fibrous fruits, leaves, and other plants. However, they probably ate meat occasionally, for direct observations have shown that most living primates are occasional carnivores and eat as much meat as they can.31 Either they hunted small or weak animals (including other primates) or they scavenged meat from animals that had died naturally or been killed by other carnivores. But in the main, australopithecine diets were vegetarian.

Analogies with modern primates occupying similar niches suggest that australopithecines probably lived in small family groups that traveled together, with individuals foraging separately for their own food. There is no evidence that they had more linguistic ability than modern chimps. This does not mean that there was no politics or no communication. As in many modern primate societies, males and females probably formed hierarchies of dominance and spent a lot of time dealing with, and presumably thinking about, group politics. Like modern chimps, australopithecines may have communicated through gestures, sounds, and activities such as grooming. But neither chimps nor australopithecines had the vocal apparatus or the intellectual ability necessary to precisely communicate abstract information.

Studies of the societies of primates closely related to modern humans offer contradictory suggestions about the nature of the earliest hominine societies. Genetically, we are closest to chimpanzees, and members of the best-known chimp species, Pan troglodytes, live in bands linked by closely related males. Males stay with their natal groups, while females move away from their natal groups. But most australopithecine species, unlike chimps, appear to have been quite sexually dimorphic (i.e., males were much larger than females). This suggests that in some respects australopithecine “societies” may have been closer to those of gorillas.32 Among gorillas, males are large because they compete with each other for access to females, which ensures that the largest males produce the most offspring. The result is a social world in which a dominant male and perhaps one other, younger male will travel with several females and their children in groups of up to about twenty individuals. Perhaps we should envisage a world somewhere between these structures. This may have been a world of bands somewhat smaller than those of modern chimps, in which closely related males competed for dominance and for access to females. Perhaps dominant males gained access to several females, but that access was not exclusive. Australopithecines may have lived in a world whose males engaged in more or less constant competition with each other to attract female partners. Yet at the reproductive core of this world of competitive but closely related males, there existed smaller but closer units, consisting of mothers and their children, as in most modern primate groups. Chimpanzee mothers are known to form durable and clearly affectionate relations with their children, while males show little interest in the tasks of child rearing and no sense of paternity. All in all, there is little to suggest that australopithecines were radically different in their physiology or lifeways from the ape species of today.





Tool Use and Meat Eating: Homo habilis




For hominid specialists, Olduvai Gorge, a 50-kilometer-wide canyon in the Serengeti Plain in northern Tanzania that is part of the African Rift Valley, is a special place: finds from here have provided the best evidence that our species evolved in Africa. Here, in 1960, Jonathan Leakey—the son of Louis Leakey, one of the pioneers of modern studies of human evolution—found a hominine fossil about 1.4 meters tall. Louis Leakey claimed that it belonged to the same genus as human beings (Homo) and therefore christened it Homo habilis, or “handy man.” This made it the oldest species of the genus that includes modern humans.

Though many anthropologists felt the remains simply belonged to an unusually gracile form of australopithecine, two factors encouraged Leakey to think that this species was more “human.” First, associated with Homo habilis he found the earliest evidence for the systematic manufacture and use of stone tools. The skills involved in these activities seemed significantly more complex than those evident among earlier hominines. Second, the brains of habilis were a lot bigger than those of the australopithecines, ranging from 600 to 800 cubic centimeters. Homo habilis seemed to be a tool-using, learning animal, like modern humans; so perhaps the appearance of the new species, about 2.3 million years ago, marked the real beginnings of human history. Modern anthropologists have retained Leakey’s nomenclature, and there is no doubt that habilis shows distinctive features, some of which may have been triggered by ecological changes caused by cooler, drier climates beginning about 2.5 million years ago. For example, stone tools made by habilis show signs of “handedness,” which implies a division between left and right sides of the brain; that, in turn, may be a necessary precondition for improved linguistic skills.33 Nevertheless, recent research into the growing number of habilis remains and sites has shown that the gulf between them and modern humans in intellectual ability and lifeways is wider than Leakey supposed.34

Part of the reason for these shifts in attitudes toward habilis is that modern paleontologists are less impressed than Leakey was by signs of tool use. We now know that many animals use tools of some kind, and chimpanzees use tools in more ways than any other animals apart from humans. For example, chimps have been observed inserting sticks into termite mounds, then quickly pulling them out and eating the termites that are still clinging to them; some even use rocks to crack open nuts. However, habilis seems to have used tools in new ways that required more planning and foresight. Paleontologists describe their stone tools as Oldowan, a name taken from the Olduvai Gorge in which so many have been found. These tools have a quite distinctive form that persists in the archaeological record for almost 2 million years, until almost 250,000 years ago (see figure 6.3). They consist mainly of large stones, often river cobbles of tough basalt or quartzite, from which smaller chips have been removed by striking with a “hammer” stone, to create one or two cutting edges.

Making such tools requires considerable planning and experience, much more than is needed to make the simple tools used by chimpanzees. Modern experiments in stone knapping have shown that the original stones need to be chosen carefully, and struck with precision. In fact, making stone tools requires precisely those skills that are the forte of the prefrontal cortex, that part of the brain that was to expand most significantly in human evolution. It is possible that tool use evolved through a process known as Baldwinian adaptation (named after the nineteenth-century American psychologist who first described it systematically). This is a form of evolutionary change that appears to combine Darwinian and cultural elements, because behavioral changes lead to changes in an animal’s lifeways, thereby creating new selective pressures that lead, over time, to genetic changes. For example, species that learn new behaviors that let them live in cold climates may eventually adapt genetically to their new environments by evolving furry coats (as did mammoths or woolly rhinos). Among humans, groups that herded domestic animals eventually acquired, over many generations, an enhanced capacity to digest milk, as rare mutations that prolong the production of the milk-digesting enzyme lactase into adult life became more common. Perhaps, in a similar way, hominine individuals that were most skilled at making and using tools gained such selective advantages that they had more offspring than others, so that their intellectual skills were soon incorporated into the genetic makeup of the entire species. If so, then tool use may have been both a cause and an effect of brain growth, in a process of positive feedback.

What were the stone tools used for? Modern experiments have shown that Oldowan choppers could be used successfully to break up bones or to work more crudely in wood. But the chips struck off them were probably more important than the cores, for these made small, sharp flakes that could be used for butchering and carving. So we can imagine habilis individuals and groups carrying pebbles with them as they foraged, and striking flakes off those pebbles when necessary. Microscopic examination of their edges has shown that Oldowan stone tools had many uses. Perhaps their most important role was in making available a richer and more varied diet. They could be employed to get at tubers that were otherwise inaccessible. Even more important, choppers and the flakes made from them could be used to scare away other predators from killed animals, to get at the marrow bones of large animals, and to butcher their carcasses. However they got their meat, habilis individuals ate more of it than did australopithecines, as dental evidence suggests. This richer food stuff may have provided some of the extra metabolic energy needed to support larger brains, particularly if, as seems likely, meat eating permitted a shortening of the gut, thereby reducing the amount of energy needed to process and digest food. Meat eating may also have led to more complex social lives, for it has recently been shown that chimps value meat highly and will use it as a sort of currency—a way of bargaining with others for sexual, political, or material favors.35 In short, eating more meat may have stimulated new forms of intellectual and social complexity.

But we should not exaggerate the importance of meat in habilis diets. It is no longer believed that these primates were more than occasional hunters, perhaps like some groups of modern chimps.36 Study of habilis teeth suggests that they, too, lived mainly off fruits and plant foods, even if meat provided an occasional and highly valued supplementary food. Besides, their stone tools were remarkably simple in comparison with those of modern foragers and, while useful in foraging or scavenging, they would have been of little use in true hunting. Close examination of cut marks on bones at habilis sites shows that they butchered carcasses but did not always kill them, for the cuts they inflicted often lie over the tooth marks of other animals. They may have killed small animals, but they probably scavenged the meat of larger animals that had died of natural causes or had been killed by other animals.

Anatomical studies also suggest that habilis was not completely bipedal, and may have spent much time in trees. So we should imagine habilis groups of any number from five to thirty individuals foraging separately during the day, like modern primates or australopithecines, and perhaps coming together at night and taking refuge in trees. Their preferred ecological niche was still similar to that of the australopithecines, though the scavenging of meat was more important to them and they spent more of their time on the ground.

All in all, there is no clear evidence of the quantum leap in intelligence and social complexity that Louis Leakey assumed when he first encountered Homo habilis.





Larger Brains and Ranges: Homo ergaster and Homo erectus




Homo habilis lived in East Africa with several other species, including robust australopithecines (Paranthropus). Indeed, in a pattern that is common in the early history of new adaptations such as bipedalism, the early history of hominines shows a great variety. Perhaps six or more different species of hominines lived at the time of habilis.

About 1.8 million years ago, at the transition from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene period on the geological timescale, there appeared a new hominine species, known to modern anthropologists as Homo erectus or Homo ergaster.37 A spectacularly well-preserved sample of ergaster, dated to ca. 1.8 million years ago, was found at Nariokotome, in Kenya, in 1984. “Turkana boy,” as this fossil is known, is the most complete of all hominine fossils. Turkana boy died while still an adolescent, but he was already more than 1.5 meters tall and had a skull of ca. 880 cubic centimeters, almost larger than those of most habilis individuals.38

By one million years ago, in one of the more spectacular hominine radiations, various forms of erectus/ergaster displaced all other forms of hominines. Homo ergaster individuals were taller than habilis and had larger brains, ranging from 850 to 1,000 cubic centimeters. This brings them close to the range of brain sizes in modern humans. There are other signs that they were significantly closer to modern humans. From ca. 1.5 million years ago, they began to manufacture a new type of stone tool, known as Acheulian hand axes, whose production demanded more intellectual sophistication than Oldowan tools. They are shaped more precisely and more elegantly than Oldowan choppers. And they are shaped on all sides, to form pear-shaped “axes,” normally with at least two cutting edges. Sometimes, Acheulian stone tools were finished with a bone hammer to produce a finer edge. Some ergaster populations may also have learned to use fire. This would have provided valuable protection, particularly in cave dwellings, and would also have made it possible to soften and clean meat by cooking it. However, if they did use fire, they did so unsystematically. There is no evidence, for example, that they used hearths.39

It is likely that ergaster had linguistic abilities superior to those of habilis, but how superior is hard to tell. Larger forebrains suggest an increased capacity to understand and process symbols, while a larynx that sat lower in the throat may have allowed greater vocal flexibility; as a result, vocal communication may have increased in importance in comparison with gestural communication. Still, there is little direct evidence of the rich capacity for symbolic activity that is apparent in the fossil evidence of modern humans, so it seems likely that symbolic communication, even if it existed in some form, had not yet had a revolutionary impact on either the behavior or the consciousness of ergaster.40 Steven Mithen has made the interesting suggestion that ergaster individuals may still have used what language ability they had mainly in social situations.41 There is no evidence that language was used to deal with technological problems, for once they appeared, the Acheulian axes of ergaster show little change over a million years. And, though ergaster diets probably included more meat than the diets of their habilis relatives, it is unlikely that even they engaged in systematic hunting of the kind we find among modern foragers.

The most important sign that there was an increase in the behavioral flexibility of these species is the fact that they included the first hominines to migrate out of East Africa and then out of Africa entirely and into Eurasia. By about 700,000 years ago, communities of Homo erectus lived in parts of southern Asia and had even entered Ice Age Europe. Erectus remains were first found in Indonesia in 1891, and perhaps the best-known finds were made in the 1920s at the Zhoukoudian cave, which is today just a suburban train ride from modern Beijing. All in all, erectus explored a wider range of niches than those used by habilis—“wider” both ecologically and geographically. In particular, they apparently managed to live in regions whose climates would have been too cold or too seasonal for habilis.

An increase in the niches available to a species is normally a sign of considerable demographic success, and it seems reasonable to assume that the numbers of hominines increased with the number of available niches. Though we do not know the numbers of any early species of hominines, they were probably similar to the populations of great apes before the twentieth century. There were perhaps a few tens of thousands or perhaps as many as one or two hundred thousand hominines at any one time, and their numbers probably grew as they migrated into western and northern Africa and then into southern Eurasia. But there is as yet no evidence for long-term growth in the population numbers even of erectus. So we should not exaggerate the significance of these migrations out of Africa. In southern Eurasia, erectus entered environments that were more seasonal than those of East Africa’s savanna lands, but otherwise quite similar. And many other mammal species had made similar migrations, including earlier species of hominoids. Finally, it is striking that erectus did not manage to inhabit the cold heartland of northern Eurasia.42 Nor is there any evidence that they made the sea crossing to Australia and Papua New Guinea.





Prehuman Hominines of the Past Million Years




During the past million years, several new types of hominines appeared in different parts of Africa and Eurasia. And everywhere the brains of these species expanded rapidly. Eventually, many had brains as large as 1,300 cubic centimeters, which puts them within the range of modern human brain sizes. Beginning about 200,000 years ago, there also appears, after a long period of little technological change, a new type of stone technology: the so-called Levallois or Mousterian tools. In these, a stone core, shaped like a tortoise shell, was prepared in such a way that several flakes could be struck from it with a single, precisely calculated blow. Presumably a more varied tool kit was tied to the exploration of new niches.

Why should hominine brains have grown so quickly? Explaining brain growth is harder than it may seem, for large brains are rare—and with good reason. The modern human brain is arguably the most complex single object we know. Indeed, E. O. Wilson has argued that the evolution of the human brain constitutes one of the four great turning points in the history of life on earth.43 Each human brain contains perhaps 100 billion nerve cells, as many cells as there are stars in an average galaxy. These connect up with each other (on average, each neuron may be connected to 100 other neurons) to form networks of astonishing complexity that may contain 60,000 miles of linkages. Such a structure can compute in parallel. That means that although each computation may be slower than that of a modern computer, the total number of computations being carried out in a particular moment is much, much greater. While a fast modern computer may be able to complete one billion computations a second, even the brain of a fly at rest can handle at least a hundred times as many!44 Surely, evolving a biological computer as powerful as this must have been a good Darwinian move.

But though this argument is intuitively plausible, there is a serious problem with it. If brains are so obviously “adaptive,” why have so few species evolved really large brains in comparison with their body sizes? The trouble is that brains are costly to maintain. The human brain uses 20 percent of the energy needed to support a human body, but accounts for only 3 percent of body weight. Bearing large-headed infants is also difficult and dangerous, particularly for a bipedal species, as bipedalism requires narrow rather than wide hips. In other words, growing big brains is a chancy evolutionary gamble. So we cannot just assume that big brains evolved because they were obviously advantageous. Instead, we have to find more specific explanations.

One answer may be that brains provided good radiators for species living out in the open. This answer is not as flippant as it sounds. But there may be subtler and better answers. Perhaps there were feedback loops, involving forms of Baldwinian evolution. Changes in one area (either genetic or behavioral) may have caused changes in other areas, which created new selective pressures that reinforced the original change. One such loop, as we have seen, may link tool use and brain size.

A second loop, which may have operated in tandem, links sociability and brain size. Even among chimps, it has been shown that the capacity to calculate social relations accurately can increase the reproductive chances of individuals. And such processes may set up relatively speedy feedback loops, as more socially skilled individuals mate more frequently, producing more offspring who, in turn, are likely to have greater social and political skills. Eventually, such processes could have encouraged the expansion of those parts of the brain best able to make complex social calculations.45 However, larger brains made birth a more painful and difficult process. At some stage, this problem may have been solved by a change in the rate of infant development. Hominine babies were born at an earlier stage of maturity. But this solution meant that infants became more and more helpless and demanded more parenting. That increased the importance of mothers being surrounded by a supportive social group, including both males and females. This shift may be linked to the fact that humans, unlike most other great apes (except for orangutans), have lost the estrous cycle; as a result, they can be sexually active even when conception is impossible. The partial separation of sexuality from reproduction may have encouraged stronger pair-bonding between males and females, thereby increasing the role of males in parenting, a change that may also be linked to declining sexual dimorphism in humans.46 Whatever the details of these complex processes (and the archaeological record is too ambiguous for any certainty), hominines had to become more social as their brains grew larger. But living in larger or more complex social groups requires, as we have seen, complex social skills; and by and large, those with the greatest social skills were most likely to find mates. Feedback cycles of this kind—with increasing brain size stimulating increased social complexity, which encouraged further expansion in brain size—may explain why, at certain periods in hominine evolution, human brains (and particularly the prefrontal cortex) have expanded rapidly.47

A further possibility is that brain growth occurred as a by-product of quite small changes in the developmental schedule of hominines. As we have seen, neoteny, or the evolution of species similar to the juvenile forms of the species from which they evolved, occurs because of slight rearrangements in the genetic codes governing the rate and timing of development, as a result of which most features of a species develop more slowly, except for its sexual maturity. Thus, adult humans have flat faces and are relatively hairless. Chimps also have these qualities, but only during their youth. As they age, their muzzles push outward and they become more hairy. Most important of all, modern humans maintain the rate of brain growth typical of juvenile chimps, but sustain these rates for longer periods. This means that they grow larger brains and maintain for a longer time the rapid learning pace of juveniles. In this way, small alterations in the genes that control developmental processes can have a huge impact on the adult form of neotenous species.

A final possibility is that rapid brain growth has something to do with the evolution of more sophisticated forms of language. As with tool use, language skills probably correlated closely with brain power, giving those individuals with slightly bigger brains a significant Darwinian advantage. This would have accelerated the evolution of even larger brains in one more evolutionary feedback loop. We will explore this line of argument more carefully in the next chapter.

Whatever the cause, we know that hominine brains grew quickly beginning about 500,000 years ago. These changes provide clear evidence of increased intellectual capacity, and perhaps of increased linguistic ability. But, frustratingly, there is still little evidence of revolutionary changes in hominine lifeways. The best-known of these later hominine species are the Neanderthals. The first Neanderthal fossils were found in 1856 in the Neander valley in Germany. Though Neanderthals were long assigned to the same species as modern humans (technically, they were known as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis), recent genetic tests, using remnant DNA from Neanderthal fossils, suggest that the human and Neanderthal lines diverged perhaps as much as 700,000 to 550,000 years ago.48

Neanderthals first appear in the archaeological record about 130,000 years ago, and they vanish from the record as recently as 25,000 years ago. Their brains were as large as, and perhaps even larger than, those of modern humans, but their bodies were tougher and stockier. They clearly had the ability to hunt, and this enabled them to occupy Ice Age landscapes that had not been inhabited by any earlier hominines—for example, in parts of modern Ukraine and southern Russia. However, their hunting methods were inefficient and unsystematic in comparison with those of modern foragers, or even humans of the upper Paleolithic era. Their stone tools, usually described as Mousterian, are more complex than those of erectus, but show far less variety and precision than the stone tools of modern humans. There are hints of Neanderthal art or burial ritual, both of which might have signaled an increased use of symbolic communication (but the evidence is ambiguous). And there is little sign of great social complexity. Like earlier hominines, Neanderthals seem to have lived primarily in simple family groups that had limited contact with each other. There is no evidence that Neanderthals could have had the same impact on the planet as modern humans.





SUMMARY




This is a frustrating conclusion. We have seen that the evolution of modern humans was a revolutionary event within the history of the earth. And we can see all the elements of modern humanity being assembled over several million years. Hominines evolved larger brains, which gave them an increased behavioral flexibility and perhaps also the beginnings of a capacity for symbolic language. They learned to use tools in more complex ways than any other primate, which gave them access to a more varied diet. Taken together, these changes apparently enabled Homo erectus to explore a wider range of habitats than any other closely related species. Yet there is not any clear evidence in the fossil record of revolutionary changes in the behaviors even of later hominine species before ca. 250,000 BP. We have not yet left the realm of natural selection, in which genetic change eclipses cultural change. It is hard to imagine how any earlier species of hominine could have transformed the world as our own species has done. This is true even of Neanderthals, a species remarkably close to us genetically, with brains as large and perhaps even larger than ours. What is it, then, that is revolutionary about modern humans and human history? And in what way did the changes described in this chapter prepare the way for their revolutionary ecological impact? The next chapter will offer some tentative answers.





FURTHER READING




There are many good popular books on human evolution, but the field is changing so quickly that books can date rapidly. One of the best texts is Roger Lewin’s Human Evolution (4th ed., 1999), while The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution (1992), edited by Steve Jones et al., is a superb reference work. Two of the major figures in the field, Richard Leakey and Donald Johanson, have both written accessible books on the subject (Leakey, The Origin of Humankind [1994]; Johanson and Maitland A. Edey, Lucy [1981]). Jared Diamond’s The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee (1991) is a punchy survey of the field, and Paul Ehrlich’s Human Natures (2000) is another recent general survey. Other general surveys include Göran Burenhult, ed., The Illustrated History of Humankind (5 vols., 1993–94); Brian Fagan, People of the Earth (10th ed., 2001), a widely used text; Robert Foley, Humans before Humanity (1995); Ian Tattersall, Becoming Human (1998); Robert Wenke, Patterns in Prehistory (3rd ed., 1990); and Peter Bogucki, The Origins of Human Society (1999). Clive Gamble’s Timewalkers (1995) is one of the best general surveys of the Paleolithic era. On the evolution of consciousness and thought, Steven Mithen, The Prehistory of the Mind (1996); Terrence Deacon, The Symbolic Species (1997); Steven Pinker, The Language Instinct (1994) and How the Mind Works (1997); William Calvin, The Ascent of Mind (1991) and How Brains Think (1998); and Nicholas Humphrey, A History of the Mind (1992) are all valuable, though this remains territory in which there is more speculation than hard proof. Craig Stanford’s books, The Hunting Apes (1999) and Significant Others (2001), give a good insight into what modern primatology has to offer to the story of human evolution. In Nonzero (2000), Robert Wright discusses the crucial role of non-zero-sum games in human history.
