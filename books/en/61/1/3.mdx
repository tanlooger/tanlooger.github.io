title: CHAPTER 3 ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF THE EARTH
---






The previous two chapters surveyed regions so vast that light can take billions of years to cross them and the stars they contain may be as numerous as grains of sand on a beach. Toward the end of chapter 2, we zoomed in on one region of a single galaxy, the Milky Way. In this chapter, we shift to a more intimate scale, that of a single star and one of its planets. On this tiny scale, we think of our local star as “the Sun”—and it seems to dominate our universe. So it is not surprising that many earthly religions regard the Sun as the supreme god. But the earth is where we live, and in many religions the earth is the mother and nurturer. The Greeks called her “Gaia.”

Our earth, like the other planets and moons of our solar system, is a by-product of the creation of our sun. Gravity, though not the only active agent, dominates this story as it does the story of star formation in general. Our understanding of how the solar system was created has been revolutionized since the 1960s, through the use of satellites that have let us travel, at secondhand, through much of the solar system.





THE SOLAR SYSTEM




The planets of our solar system, including our own earth, were created at the same time as our sun, about 4.56 billion years ago. They are all about one-third of the age of the universe. Studies of the composition and motion of the Sun, the planets, and the moons and meteorites within the solar system, together with recent observations of planet formation around nearby stars, give us considerable confidence in modern explanations of how our solar system formed. But there remains some uncertainty about the details.

The Sun contains perhaps 99.9 percent of the matter in the solar system. What interests us now is the remaining 0.1 percent, for it is from that tiny residue that all the planets, including our earth, were born. We have seen that as clouds of matter shrink, gravity tends to spin them and flatten them into disks. The solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust from which our solar system formed, was no exception. As the Sun formed during a period of about 100,000 years, its gravitational pull drew most of the matter in the solar nebula to the center. But wisps of dust and gas, held at a distance by centrifugal forces, orbited the Sun like the rings around the large, gassy planets of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. We can be sure of this because in the late 1990s, astronomers managed for the first time to see similar disks around newly formed stars in our suburb of the Milky Way. The solar nebula consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium (ca. 98 percent of its mass), with other elements sprinkled through it in minuscule amounts.





Timeline 3.1. The scale of the earth, the biosphere, and “Gaia”: 4.5 billion years.





As the Sun lit up, the inner rings of the solar nebula were heated more than the outer rings. This heat drove the more volatile (gassy) materials away from the inner regions. But farther out, from about the orbit of the future Jupiter on, it was cold enough for volatile gases to become liquids or solids. As a result, the inner orbits contained much more rocky material, while the more volatile materials accumulated farther from the Sun. This explains why the inner planets are rocky, while the outer planets (from Jupiter outward) are dominated by substances such as hydrogen and helium that are gases on earth. It also explains why the outer planets are so big: Jupiter contains more than 300 times the mass of Earth (though it is still only ca. the size of the Sun), and Saturn almost 100 times Earth’s mass. (Pluto, which is much smaller even than our moon, is no longer reckoned to be a true planet but rather the largest of the surviving planetesimals.) Water (ice) is the most common of all simple chemical compounds, as it is formed from the two most abundant reactive elements, hydrogen and oxygen. So, planets that formed at distances where water was normally a solid were bound to be larger than those formed in regions where water existed as a gas and could easily be driven away. The larger mass of the outer planets also made it easier for them to capture elements such as hydrogen and helium that remain gases even at extremely low temperatures. To this day, the solar system is divided into two main populations of planets: an inner ring of smallish, rocky planets, with densities exceeding 3 grams per cubic centimeter, and an outer ring of huge but less dense planets, with densities of less than 2 grams per cubic centimeter.

Though temperatures and materials varied from orbit to orbit, within each orbit particles of matter collided with each other or were drawn together by gravity. Sometimes, they stuck together, held by electrostatic forces—the same forces that enable a piece of rubbed amber to lift scraps of paper. In a mechanism first guessed at by the German philosopher Kant in 1755, and known to astronomers as accretion, small, soft blobs of rock were formed from these gentle collisions. These formed lumps the size of snowballs, which grew into objects such as meteorites and then into planetesimals. Like dodgem cars, the planetesimals followed chaotic orbits and frequently collided with each other. As they grew larger, the collisions became more violent. Within 100,000 years, there existed many small planetesimals up to 10 kilometers in diameter. Modern comets such as Halley’s comet are mostly survivors from this early stage of the solar system’s history, and thus they help us imagine what some of these early planetesimals may have looked like. However, the comets that survive today mostly fell into more eccentric or more remote orbits, partly under the gravitational tug of the emerging superplanet, Jupiter. As a result, they escaped being incorporated into planets. Billions of comets still orbit beyond the outer planets in the Oort Cloud, which begins beyond Neptune, at more than 35 times Earth’s distance from the Sun. Most are tiny, but some, such as Chiron, may be up to 200 kilometers in diameter.

About 100,000 years after the formation of the Sun, the newly formed sun blasted away the remaining gas and dust particles in the inner orbits, in what is known as the T Tauri wind. This is a phenomenon commonly associated with young stars. Presumably, the T Tauri wind also swept away any young atmosphere on the planetesimal that would eventually form the earth. What remained in the inner orbits were the solid planetesimals too large to be affected by the solar wind. Gradually, in all orbits, the largest planetesimals lured smaller objects into their gravitational nets, until the largest in each orbit had swept up most of the remaining material within its reach. In this way, perhaps within a million years of the Sun’s formation, there emerged some thirty proto-planets, similar in size to our moon or to Mars; each dominated a particular orbit, and all circled in the plane of the original solar disk. During the next hundred million years, these consolidated into the planetary system we see today.

The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the asteroids) were made mainly from silicates (compounds of silicon and oxygen), as well as metals and trapped gases. Earth, for example, is made up of oxygen (almost 50 percent) and smaller amounts of iron (19 percent), silicon (14 percent), magnesium (12.5 percent), and many other elements of the periodic table. Between Mars and Jupiter, the asteroids may be the remnants of a “failed” rocky planet, whose formation was disrupted by the strong gravitational pull of nearby Jupiter. Jupiter, the largest of the planets, probably formed quite rapidly, perhaps 50 million or more years before Earth.1 It is almost large enough for nuclear reactions to have begun in its center. It is almost, but not quite, a small star. If Jupiter had been slightly larger, then the solar system might have had two suns, and its structure and history would have been very different. The planets would have orbited in much less stable patterns, and it seems unlikely that life could have emerged on any of them.

The disks of matter that exist around all the larger planets (most spectacularly in the case of Saturn) show that all were large enough to have formed with their own nebulae, just like embryonic stars. In fact, Jupiter’s nebula was so similar to that of the Sun that its inner moons, Io and Europa, are quite rocky, while its outer moons are more gassy, presumably because radiation from the early planet drove gassy elements away.

Is our solar system unique, or are solar systems quite common? Until recently, astronomers had no direct means of detecting the existence of planets around even the closest stars. It seemed that the solar system might be unusual, perhaps even singular. However, in 1995 astronomers for the first time demonstrated the existence of a planet orbiting another star, by careful measurements of slight wobbles in the star’s motion. In the next six years, almost seventy other planets were identified in the same way. In May 1998, the Hubble Space Telescope took what seems to be the first photograph of a planet. It was huge—three times the size of Jupiter—and seems to have been ejected by a system of binary stars in the constellation of Taurus.2 Astronomers have also photographed the accretion disks of embryonic solar systems. Such evidence suggests that solar systems may be quite common, though their exact structures may vary greatly. If only 10 percent of stars form with attendant planets, as recent evidence suggests, then even within our own galaxy there could be billions of stars with solar systems of some kind. This means that the astronomical niche in which we exist, though unusual on the scale of the universe, is not rare. Just within the Milky Way, there may be millions of planetary systems capable, in principle, of supporting life of some kind. Does this mean that life is common in the universe ? We will return to this question below, and also in chapter 4, when we examine how life itself first appeared on Earth.





THE EARLY EARTH: MELTDOWN AND COOLING




Accretion was a chaotic and violent process, and it became more so as planetesimals grew in size and gravitational pull. Within each orbit, collisions between planetesimals generated immense heat and energy. How violent these processes were is suggested by the odd tilt and spin of many of the planets, which indicate that each of the planets was, like a billiard ball, struck at some stage by another large body of some kind. Visual evidence of these processes can be seen by looking at the surface of the Moon. Because the Moon has no atmosphere, its surface is not subject to erosion, so it retains the marks of its early history. And its face is deeply scarred by millions of meteoric impacts, as you can see on a clear night with simply a pair of binoculars. For perhaps a billion years, the earth’s history was quite as violent, until the earth itself had swept up most of the remaining material in its orbit. The violence of this early, “Hadean” epoch of the earth’s history explains why so little evidence survives from the period (see table A1, in appendix 1). After about a billion years, collisions became less frequent. Some planetesimals have survived, of course, to the present day. So collisions still occur, and some have played a crucial role in the earth’s history. But such collisions are much rarer than they were in the Hadean epoch.

The early earth didn’t have much of an atmosphere. Before it grew to full size, its gravitational pull was insufficient to prevent gases from drifting off into space, while the solar wind had already driven away much of the gaseous material from the inner orbits of the solar system. So we must imagine the early earth as a mixture of rocky materials, metals, and trapped gases, subjected to constant bombardment by smaller planetesimals and without much of an atmosphere. The early earth would indeed have seemed a hellish place to humans.

As it began to reach full size, the earth heated up, partly because of collisions with other planetesimals and partly because of increasing internal pressures as it grew in size. In addition, the early solar system contained abundant radioactive materials, which may have formed in the supernova explosion that occurred not long before the creation of the Sun. Much of this heat has been retained to the present day, though over time, much has also leaked to the surface from the earth’s well-insulated core. As the earth heated up, its interior melted. Within the molten interior, different elements were sorted out by density, in a process known as differentiation. By about 40 million years after the formation of the solar system, most of the heavier metallic elements in the early earth, such as iron and nickel, had sunk through the hot sludge to the center, giving the earth a core dominated by iron. This metallic core gives the earth its characteristic magnetic field. The earth’s magnetic field has played an extremely important role in the history of our planet: by deflecting the many high-energy particles streaming through space, it shielded the delicate chemical processes that eventually generated life here.

As heavy materials headed for the center of the earth, lighter silicates drifted upward, in a process analogous to those in a modern blast furnace. The denser silicates formed the earth’s mantle, a region almost 3,000 kilometers sthick between the core and the crust. With the help of the cometary bombardment, whose many impacts scarred and heated the earth’s surface, the lightest silicates rose to the surface, where they cooled more rapidly than the better-insulated materials in the earth’s interior. These lighter materials, such as the rocks we call granites, formed a layer of continental crust about 35 kilometers thick. Relative to the earth as a whole, this is as thin as an eggshell. Seafloor crust (formed largely from volcanic basalts) is even thinner, at about 7 kilometers. From the surface of the earth to its core is a distance of almost 6,400 kilometers; thus, even continental crust reaches only about of the way to the earth’s core. Much of the early continental crust has remained on the earth’s surface to the present day. The oldest portions of continental crust, found today in parts of Canada, Australia, South Africa, and Greenland, appear to be about 3.8 billion years old.

The lightest materials of all, including gases such as hydrogen and helium, bubbled through the earth’s interior to the surface. So we can imagine the surface of the early earth as a massive volcanic field. And we can judge pretty well what gases bubbled up to that surface by analyzing the mixture of gases emitted by volcanoes today. These include hydrogen (H), helium (He), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2o), nitrogen (N), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Other materials, including large amounts of water vapor, were brought in by cometary bombardments. Much of the hydrogen and helium escaped; but once the earth was fully formed, it was large enough for its gravitational field to hold most of the remaining gases, and these formed the earth’s first stable atmosphere. Much of the methane and hydrogen sulfide was converted into carbon dioxide (CO2), which soon dominated the early atmosphere. In a carbon dioxide atmosphere, the sky would have seemed red rather than blue to us. However, as the earth cooled, water vapor that had accumulated in its atmosphere fell in torrential rains lasting millions of years. These downpours created the earliest oceans. The first oceans must have existed before 3.5 billion years ago, for we know that living organisms existed by that date; their presence suggests that temperatures at the earth’s surface had fallen below 100°C. The early oceans dissolved much of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To a human eye the sky would have seemed to gradually turn blue.

The fact that water exists in liquid form on the earth’s surface is of fundamental importance to us, for it means that Earth’s temperatures were suitable for the appearance of the complex and fragile molecules that made up the earliest life forms. Why Earth’s temperatures are so benign for life remains uncertain. Perhaps in all solar systems there is a narrow band—just far enough from the local sun not to boil, but close enough to get some warmth—within which life can emerge. Yet we know that atmospheres do not evolve according to simple and predictable rules. On Venus, the early atmosphere may have been similar to Earth’s; but a thick blanket of clouds and the greater amounts of sunlight it received caused a runaway greenhouse effect, with the result that the surface of Venus is now hot enough to boil lead. Venus has in effect been sterilized. Because it is smaller and has a weaker gravitational pull, Mars has hardly any atmosphere today, though it may have had more in the past. Perhaps Earth proved suitable for life because of a rare combination of circumstances, suggesting that even if the universe contains billions of planets, few may be hospitable to life.3 However, as we will see in chapter 5, once life formed, living organisms started making themselves at home, shaping the atmosphere and surface of the earth to make it more suitable for life.

Many of the ingredients of the early atmosphere (including much of its water), together with many of the organic chemicals that formed the first life forms, may have been brought to Earth by the comets that bombarded its surface for the first billion years of its life.4 This constant bombardment may also explain the creation of the Moon, perhaps 50 to 100 million years after the formation of the solar system. Study of moon rocks has shown that this satellite is less dense than the earth, and contains much less iron. The discrepancy can be explained by supposing that the earth was struck a glancing blow by a proto-planet, perhaps the size of Mars, after the process of differentiation had been completed. The collision would have gouged out material from the mantle and crust of the early earth, but not from its iron-rich core. This debris would then have orbited the earth, like Saturn’s rings, until eventually gathering into a single object by accretion, to create the Moon.

So, about one billion years after the formation of the solar system, the early earth had a moon; a hot iron core; a hot, semiliquid interior, the mantle; a thin but solid crust; seas; and an atmosphere dominated by nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. To us it would have seemed a hot, dangerous, and unpleasant place, drowned in a constant acidic rain and covered, periodically, by huge seas of lava caused by collisions with comets or asteroids. But it contained all the ingredients necessary for the earliest forms of life to evolve and thrive. Above all, it contained water, because it was far enough from the Sun for water vapor to liquefy, but close enough to prevent it all from freezing.





EVIDENCE ABOUT THE EARLY EARTH




How can we know so much about the early earth? There is, of course, an element of speculation in the account I have given, but it is also based on a lot of hard data. Two types of information are so important that they are worth discussing in more detail.

We can bore only a tiny way into the earth; to study its deep interior, we must use indirect methods. Fortunately, methods of describing the earth’s interior have developed as a by-product of the study of earthquakes. Geologists study earthquakes by using seismographs, which are instruments that measure sudden vibrations of the earth caused by violent shocks. By placing seismographs at different parts of the earth’s surface, they can map these vibrations with great accuracy, defining their point of origin and their power and form. It is also possible to map how these vibrations travel through the earth’s interior. These exercises have shown that waves travel in different ways through different types of material; from this evidence, it is possible to map out the different layers of which the earth is composed (see figure 3.1).

Even more remarkable are the techniques that enable us to attach absolute dates to events many millions or even billions of years in the past. Indeed, this capacity to offer precise absolute dates for events in the remote past—including those in the early history of the earth—is one of the most extraordinary features of the modern creation myth (see appendix 1).

In the past, remote dates had to be estimated using whatever techniques were at hand.5 Genealogical records provided one of the most important of all ways of dating the past. In seventeenth-century Europe, biblical scholars used the genealogical lists in the Old Testament to calculate when God made the world. In the late eighteenth century, geologists learned how to determine relative dates for many major geological events in the distant past by studying the different layers in which particular fossils or rock types were found. Relative dates cannot quite tell us when an animal lived or a particular rock was laid down, but they can tell us the order in which events occurred. Paleontologists became connoisseurs of particular fossils that could be used as precise markers of relative ages. In the hands of an expert, a particular type of trilobite or the odd, saw-toothed marks left by ancient creatures known as graptolites can prove that rocks from quite different parts of the world were laid down at about the same time. Such methods were used to construct the earliest versions of the geological timescale, which tells us the rough order in which different rock layers and different types of organisms appeared (see Table A1). By the nineteenth century, even these rough techniques were suggesting that the earth had to be much more than 6,000 years old. However, most scientists believed the earth had existed for at most a few hundred million years.

Relative dating has become more and more refined, and remains a powerful method for dating rocks. But the most important revolution in dating occurred in the twentieth century with the emergence of what are known as radiometric dating techniques. In many situations, these enable us to tell, with surprising precision, exactly when a particular object was formed. So, using these methods, we can determine absolute as well as relative dates for many events that occurred long before humans existed. Radiometric dating techniques are described in more detail in appendix 1.





Figure 3.1. The structure of the earth’s interior. We do not yet have the ability to penetrate deep within the earth. But we can use seismic waves, the vibrations generated by earthquakes, to determine what’s there. There are three kinds of seismic waves: primary waves, secondary waves, and surface waves. Each moves at a different speed and is affected in different ways by the material through which it passes. So, by analyzing the speed of arrival of different types of waves at different points on the earth’s surface, it is possible to tell a lot about the internal structure of the earth. The graph shows the seismographic record of the earthquake at the top of the upper diagram, as recorded by the seismograph. Adapted from Cesare Emiliani, The Scientific Companion: Exploring the Physical World with Facts, Figures, and Formulas, 2nd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1995), p. 174: adapted from Arthur N. Strahler, The Earth Sciences, 2nd ed. (New York: Harper and Row, 1971), p. 397, fig. 23.22; p. 395, fig 23.17.



The dates we use to construct the modern account of the earth’s creation are based mainly on the analysis of material still drifting through the solar system. Material on the earth’s surface, or even deep within the earth, has been recycled so often that it can tell us little about the earliest stages of the earth’s formation. The oldest datable rocks on Earth (from Greenland) are about 3.8 billion years old, which is perhaps 800 million years after the formation of the planet. To find out when the earth and the solar system were formed, we must use materials that have remained unchanged since the early days of the solar system’s life. Meteorites (particularly the type known as chondrites) fit the bill nicely, as they seem to consist of debris from the solar nebula within which our solar system formed. This means that they formed early in the history of our solar system; and they have changed little since their creation. It is thus not surprising that radiometric dating techniques regularly yield dates of about 4.56 billion years for meteorites. The oldest moon rocks yield similar dates. The closeness of these dates and the absence of anything older in the solar system suggest that the solar system itself was created about 4.56 billion years ago.





THE ORIGINS OF MODERN GEOLOGY




How did the hot, early earth evolve into today’s earth, with its blue skies, its oxygen-rich atmosphere, its mountains, continents, and oceans?

Before the 1960s, geography and geology were already well-developed fields of study, and they had accumulated much hard evidence about the ways in which landforms and oceans were constructed. But they lacked a central, organizing idea that could help explain the transition from the hostile early earth to the earth we know today. In the late 1960s, with the appearance and widespread acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics, earth sciences acquired a central idea or paradigm as powerful as that of the big bang theory in modern astronomy. Then, for the first time, it became possible to tell a coherent, scientific story of the earth’s history.

The modern tradition of geology evolved in Europe, so it was greatly influenced by the creation myths of Christianity. But as we have seen, the belief that the earth had been created by God about 6,000 years ago began to be threatened as early as the seventeenth century. A Danish scientist, Nicholas Steno, first argued that fossils were the remains of organisms that had once lived on earth. He also argued that mountains were built up over long periods by familiar geological processes such as volcanic activity. These claims had significant consequences. For example, they suggested that fishlike fossils found high in the Alps might indeed be the remains of ancient forms of fish. Any nonmiraculous explanation of such facts had to suppose that the Alps had risen up from lands that had once been under water. And it was hard to imagine how such processes could have been compressed into a mere 6,000 years without imagining a series of catastrophic events in between. Some geologists, taking the biblical flood as their model, did indeed argue that the earth’s history had included many catastrophic events. And such theories made it possible, at least in some circles, to defend the biblical chronology until the nineteenth century

But geologists became more and more skeptical. In the eighteenth century, some began systematically to map different layers of rock. The nineteenth-century geographer Charles Lyell first stated clearly what came to be known as the principle of uniformitarianism. This was the principle, already hinted at by Steno, that the earth was created not in a series of catastrophes but over huge periods of time by the same slow geological forces that we see at work today. These included processes such as vulcanism (volcanic activity), which could raise land above its existing levels, and erosion, which slowly swept the material of highlands down to the lowlands and eventually into the sea. Lyell argued that most features of the modern world could be explained as the result of these opposite processes, the one building mountains up while the other tended to wear them down. And in a fundamental work, Principles of Geology (1830), he drew out the clear implication of this theory: the earth had existed for millions rather than thousands of years.

By the late nineteenth century, the conventional wisdom was that the earth had existed for at least 20 and perhaps as many as 100 million years. These figures were estimated by William Thompson (Lord Kelvin), by assuming that Earth and the Sun had once been molten balls of matter, which had gradually cooled. On this reading, the crucial factor in the earth’s history was its gradual cooling over millions of years. As the earth cooled, the present configuration of the lands and seas had emerged, shaped by vulcanism and erosion. Not until the discovery of radioactivity early in the twentieth century, and the discovery by Marie Curie that radioactive materials produce heat, was it realized that the Sun and Earth might have sources of heat within themselves. This suggested that they were cooling much more slowly than Lord Kelvin had imagined, and were probably much older than his influential estimate.





WEGENER AND THE MODERN THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS




In the meantime, an odd observation, first made in the seventeenth century, had prompted a number of thinkers to suggest a rather different way of describing the earth’s history. The first modern maps of the world were produced in the century after Europeans began to travel to the Americas and the Pacific. As the English philosopher Francis Bacon pointed out in 1620, it was easy to see from these maps that the continents looked like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. This similarity was most striking when the west coast of Africa was matched up with the east coast of South America. With a little imagination it was possible to suppose that at one time all the continents had fitted together. What could explain this odd fit?

The idea that the continents really had drifted apart was given a thorough scientific basis in a book called The Origin of Continents and Oceans, written in 1915 by a German geographer, Alfred Wegener. Wegener assembled a huge amount of evidence suggesting that at one time the continents had been joined together. He showed that the fit between the continents was much more impressive if, instead of matching them at their present-day water lines, he matched them at their continental shelves. Further, he showed that many modern-day geological features seemed to continue from one continent to another. For example, he described a series of rock formations, known as the Gondwana sequence, all formed, apparently, by glacial activity. The sequence reached from the north of Africa, through to West Africa, then to South America, through Antarctica, and into Australia. Wegener argued that these features had been laid down as each region had moved over the South Pole. In other words, the continents had not always been fixed in their present positions, but had, as it were, “drifted” across the surface of the earth. As a result, Wegener’s idea came to be known as the hypothesis of continental drift.

Wegener’s evidence was impressive, but he could not explain how blocks of land the size of Africa or Asia or the Americas could have moved across the surface of the earth. Partly because of this, in 1928 his theory was officially rejected by the influential American Association of Petroleum Geologists. For the next forty years, most geologists regarded his theory as no more than an interesting hypothesis, and they looked for more conventional explanations of the anomalies Wegener had explored. It was not until after the Second World War that it became possible to explain how and why the continents might move across the face of the earth. But once such an explanation was available, Wegener’s ideas became respectable again. Indeed, with modern additions, they now form the central organizing idea of modern geology: the theory of plate tectonics.

The modern theory of plate tectonics originated from technologies developed during the Second World War. New forms of warfare encouraged the development of sonar to detect submarines. But sonar also made it possible to map the seafloor more thoroughly than ever before. As oceanographers began to examine the bottom of the sea in detail, some strange features emerged. One was a chain of high subterranean mountains that ran through the center of the Atlantic and through other seas as well. At the center of these suboceanic ridges were lines of volcanoes, from which lava seeped out onto the neighboring seabed.

Studies of the magnetic fields on the seabed near the suboceanic ridges revealed a further oddity. While rocks close to the ridges generally had a normal magnetic orientation, bands farther away often had a polarity opposite to that of the modern earth, with their north pole to the south and vice versa. Farther out, the polarity was reversed again, and so on, creating a series of bands with alternating magnetic polarity. Geologists eventually realized that the polarity of the earth itself seems to switch every few hundred thousand years, and this suggested that the different bands had been laid down in different periods. As other, more precise dating techniques were applied to the seafloor, it became clear that the youngest seafloor lay closest to the midocean ridges, while bands farther away became successively older. The oldest areas of seafloor were those farthest from the midocean ridges. These turned out to be at most about 200 million years old—much younger than the oldest parts of the continental crust, some of which are almost 4 billion years old.

In the 1960s, starting with the work of an American geologist, Harry Hess, a coherent explanation of all these anomalies began to emerge. Lava, seeping up through cracks that ran through most of the major ocean systems, was creating new seafloor. Such regions are known as spreading margins. As new oceanic crust was formed, it reared up in huge ridges of basalt, but it also acted like a wedge, driving apart seafloor that already existed. As a result, some oceans, such as the Atlantic, appeared to be widening. Modern satellite observations have shown that the Atlantic is getting about 3 centimeters wider every year; it’s growing at about the same rate as our fingernails. This suggests that the Atlantic Ocean was born about 150 million years ago, as parts of what is now North America began to split away from what is now West Eurasia.

This evidence did not mean that the earth was expanding, for geologists also realized that there were areas of the earth, such as the western coast of South America, where seafloor was being sucked back into the interior. These are known as subduction margins. Here, tectonic plates collide, pushed together by seafloor spreading elsewhere in the world and jamming seafloor crust up against plates of continental crust. Oceanic crust, which consists mainly of volcanic basalts, is heavier than the granitic material that dominates continental crust. So, when an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the lighter continental plate usually rides over the oceanic plate. The oceanic plate dives beneath the continental crust and is eventually pulled down into the interior. (This constant recycling explains why oceanic crust is normally so much younger than continental crust.) Slabs of descending oceanic crust grind against the continental plates above them as well as the material below them, creating enormous heat and pressure. In South America, this heat, combined with the motions of both oceanic and continental crust, generates the volcanic activity that has created the Andes.

In some areas, regions of continental crust are forced together in what are known as collision margins. The most striking example is in northern India, where the plate that contains the Indian subcontinent has been forced up against the Asian plate. In such regions, both plates buckle up and huge mountain ranges (here, the Himalayas) are formed. Finally, there are regions in which plates seem to slide past each other, such as the San Andreas fault in California. Most plate movements cause earthquakes, because the friction between plates and the material beneath them ensures that plate movements are rarely smooth: they normally come as sudden slippages after a prolonged buildup of pressure. So in principle it is possible to map the edge of the various tectonic plates by mapping the regions of most intense earthquake activity.

Detailed mapping of regions where different portions of crust meet has shown that the uppermost layer of the earth (the lithosphere) consists of a number of rigid plates, like a cracked eggshell. There are eight large plates and seven smaller ones, as well as smaller slivers of material. These move over a layer of softer materials just below them, the asthenosphere, which is between 100 and 200 kilometers thick. The plates are driven by movements in the asthenosphere and also by the pressure of materials squeezed up from even deeper in the earth through the cracks between (and sometimes within) the plates. Like the scum on the surface of a slowly cooking soup, the more rigid material of the plates buckles, cracks, and moves because of the currents of softer, hotter, and more malleable materials underneath. In other words, it is the heat of the earth’s interior that provides the power needed to move great plates of matter about the surface of the earth. That heat, in its turn, is generated largely by radioactive materials within the earth, which had been formed in the supernova explosion that occurred just before the creation of our solar system. Here was the geological motor that Wegener was unable to find: he could not possibly have anticipated that the continents were being pushed around the earth by the remnant energy from a supernova that exploded more than 4.6 billion years ago. And that takes us back, once again, to gravity, for it was gravitational forces that first constructed and then destroyed the star that died in that supernova explosion.

The theory of plate tectonics provided a unifying idea for many different aspects of geology. It can help explain mountain building, volcanic activity, and the many geological anomalies explored by geographers such as Wegener. And it shows how, in principle, it might be possible to construct a history of the earth’s surface, showing what the surface of the earth looked like at different stages of its history. Meanwhile, the use of more accurate mapping systems, such as GPS (the Global Positioning System), has made it possible to measure the movement of tectonic plates with great accuracy.





A SHORT HISTORY OF THE EARTH AND THE ATMOSPHERE




The theory of plate tectonics, combined with what we know of the formation of the earth, means that today we can offer a reasonably coherent history of our earth.

The Hadean phase of the earth’s history lasted from the planet’s formation, 4.56 billion years ago, until about 600 million years later.6 During that period, the earth’s surface was hot, volcanic, and unstable. It was also subjected to a constant bombardment from comets and other surviving planetesimals.

By 3.8 billion years ago, at the beginning of what geologists call the Archean era, we know that continental crust had appeared on the earth’s surface, because some crust as old as this is still present. It is also probable that seas existed. The earth’s atmosphere was probably dominated by gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide, much of it brought in by comets. There was little free oxygen, for oxygen is highly reactive and therefore combined with other elements to form chemical compounds. The earliest portions of continental crust may have moved, but we cannot be sure that plate tectonics worked in exactly the same way as today. With an atmosphere, and plenty of water about, processes of erosion and surface change probably occurred as fast as they do today. Rapid erosion and constant bombardment explain why the early earth’s surface was made over many times, a process that left few traces for us today; our knowledge of the very earliest stages of the earth’s history thus remains sketchy.

The earliest fragments of continental crust probably formed tiny and short-lived micro-continents. These may have been surrounded by seas with many small volcanic islands, as well as subterranean volcanoes. By about 3 billion years ago, some of these micro-continents must have fused into larger plates, for plates this old can be found at the heart of modern continents, including Africa, North America, and parts of Australia. But it is only for the last half billion years that we can actually begin to reconstruct the arrangement of these plates on the surface of the earth.

Modern geology has built up an increasingly sophisticated picture of tectonic movements during the past few hundred million years. These movements have been discovered largely by studying the magnetic orientation of modern rocks whose ages are known. From this, it is possible to estimate roughly where these rocks were when they first formed. Such studies seem to reveal a simple pattern of dispersal and convergence. About 250 million years ago, most of the continental plates were joined into a supercontinent, which Wegener had christened “Pangaea.” It was surrounded by a single, large sea, known as Panthalassa. By about 200 million years ago, Pangaea began breaking up into two large continents. Laurasia, in the north, contained most of modern Asia, Europe, and North America; Gondwanaland, in the south, contained most of modern South America, Antarctica, Africa, Australia, and India. Then, both Laurasia and Gondwanaland began to fragment. Now, we may be in the early stages of a reconvergence, as Africa and India move north to join Eurasia. Recent evidence suggests that some 500 million years before the existence of Pangaea, there existed an even earlier supercontinent, now known as Rodinia.7 But at present, this is as far back as we can trace modern processes of plate tectonics (see map 3.1).

This history is a vital part of the modern creation myth, for the exact configuration of continents and seas at different eras of the earth’s history has played a crucial role in the way that life-forms evolved and atmospheres and climates operated, as we will see in chapter 5. In these and other ways, the history of the earth shaped the evolution of living organisms. The next two chapters will explore how living organisms made a home for themselves on the changing earth, and how the earth itself changed as it was clothed in a thin membrane of life.





SUMMARY




The Sun and the solar system were created at the same time, about 4.56 billion years ago, during the gravitational collapse of a cloud of matter. The Sun formed at the center of this cloud and absorbed most of the material it contained. However, the sprinkling of matter left outside the Sun orbited the new star in a flat disk. Within each orbit, clumps of matter formed through collisions and gravitational attraction, until eventually there appeared a single planetary body in each orbit. Because the more volatile elements had been driven away from the central regions by the solar wind, the inner planets tended to be more rocky and the outer planets more gaseous.

Soon after it formed, the early earth melted; heavy materials sank to the core, and lighter materials rose to the surface. By about 4 billion years ago, the earth’s interior structure was similar to its structure today. However, the earth’s surface and its atmosphere underwent a long process of change before they were as we observe them today. Since the emergence of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, it has become clear that the continental plates have moved slowly over the earth’s surface, gradually changing the configuration of continents and seas.





FURTHER READING




There are a number of good histories of the earth, including Peter Cattermole and Patrick Moore, The Story of the Earth (1986), and J. D. Macdougall, A Short History of Planet Earth (1996). The books by Preston Cloud (Cosmos, Earth, and Man [1978]; Oasis in Space [1988]) are classics, though some of their details may now be dated. Armand Delsemme, Our Cosmic Origins (1998), and Cesare Emiliani, The Scientific Companion (2nd ed., 1995), summarize many of the more technical details of this story, while Steven Stanley’s Earth and Life through Time (1986) shows how closely linked are the histories of the earth and of life on earth. James Lovelock’s several books on the Gaia hypothesis also describe the history of the earth and of life on earth as two closely intertwined stories. Isaac Asimov offers readable summaries, though some are beginning to date. Ross Taylor’s short essay “The Solar System: An Environment for Life?” (2002) conveys well how contingent events made each planet unique.
