title: CHAPTER 2 ORIGINS OF THE GALAXIES AND STARS
---




THE BEGINNINGS OF COMPLEXITY





If one had to summarize, in just one sentence, “What’s been happening since the Big Bang?,” the best answer might be to take a deep breath and say: “Ever since the beginning, gravity has been moulding cosmic structures and enhancing temperature contrasts, a prerequisite for the emergence of the complexity that lies around us ten billion years later, and of which we are part.”



Look at the sky on a clear night, and it seems obvious that stars are the most important inhabitants of our universe. But stars, like humans, do not exist in isolation. They gather into the huge cosmic societies we call galaxies, each of which may contain 100 billion stars. Our home galaxy is the Milky Way. Unlike other galaxies, which appear to us as faint stars or blurs, the Milky Way looks like a pale river of light flowing across the night sky, because we see it from inside. What is less obvious to the naked eye, and was not apparent even to most astronomers until a decade or two ago, is that galaxies gather into even larger communities. These include groups (usually a few million light-years in diameter, containing perhaps twenty galaxies) and clusters (up to 20 million light-years broad and holding hundreds, even thousands, of galaxies). Groups and clusters of galaxies are held together by gravitational forces. But there exist even larger structures, structures so large that they are stretched out by the expansion of the universe. These include superclusters (up to 100 million light-years across, with perhaps 10,000 galaxies) and the huge chains of superclusters enclosing vast bubbles of empty space that were first detected by astronomers in the 1980s. At even larger scales, the universe appears to be remarkably homogenous. This homogeneity shows up in the uniformity of the cosmic background radiation. So the complex patterns that will interest complex observers such as ourselves seem to appear only at scales smaller than chains of superclusters.

At present, these seem to be the largest ordered structures in the observable universe. Their discovery pushes us even farther from the center of the universe than Copernicus’s discovery that the earth revolved around the Sun. Our sun, it seems, is situated in an undistinguished suburb in a second-rank galaxy (the Andromeda Galaxy is the largest in our local group), in a group of galaxies that lies toward the edge of the Virgo Supercluster, which contains many thousands of other galaxies (see figure 2.1).1

More recently, it has become clear that even superclusters may be mere bit players in the history of the universe. It seems that most of the mass of the universe (90 percent or more) is not visible, and the exact nature of this mass (known appropriately as dark matter) remains a mystery. In other words, we are in the embarrassing position of not knowing what most of the universe is made of.2 This chapter will touch on theories about the nature of dark matter, but it will focus mainly on those parts of the universe that we know most about—those parts that are visible.

We take up the history of the early universe where we left it in the previous chapter: about 300,000 years after its creation, as energy and matter went their separate ways.





THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND THE FIRST GALAXIES




In the first minutes of its existence, the universe cooled so rapidly that it was impossible to manufacture elements heavier or more complex than hydrogen, helium, and (in minute amounts) lithium: elements 1, 2, and 3 in the periodic table. In the heat and chaos of the early universe, nothing more complex could survive. From a chemical point of view, the early universe was very simple, far too simple to create complex objects such as our earth or the living organisms that inhabit it. The first stars and galaxies were constructed from little more than hydrogen and helium. But they were a sign of our universe’s astonishing capacity to build complex objects from simple building blocks. Once created, stars laid the foundations for even more complex entities, including living organisms, because in their fiery cores they practiced an alchemy that turned hydrogen and helium into all the other elements of the periodic table.

So far, the story of the universe has been dominated by the expansionary force of the big bang. Now we must introduce a second large-scale force: that of gravity. Gravity is the force that Newton described so successfully in the seventeenth century and that Einstein described even more precisely early in the twentieth century. While the force of the big bang drives energy and matter apart, gravity pulls things together. Newton argued that all forms of matter exert a tug on all other forms of matter. Einstein maintained that the effects of gravity arise because of the way that large masses can warp the geometry of space-time. Einstein also showed that gravity acts on energy as well as on matter. This conclusion was not entirely surprising, for Einstein had already demonstrated that matter is really a sort of congealed energy. But he went further, offering an ingenious proof that gravity can warp energy as well as matter. The Sun is the largest object in our solar system and has the greatest mass. He argued that its huge mass ought to bend the space-time around it enough to alter the trajectory of light rays passing close to the Sun’s edge. The best opportunity for detecting this effect was during a solar eclipse, the only time when it was possible to see stars close to the Sun. If stars at the edge of the Sun were photographed just before a solar eclipse, he predicted that their movement would appear to slow down just before they passed behind the Sun. As they appeared on the other side, they would also seem to hover momentarily at the Sun’s edge before moving away from it. This effect would result from beams of starlight being bent by the Sun’s mass, just as a stick seems to bend when placed in water. In 1919, Einstein’s prediction was tested during a solar eclipse and found to be astonishingly accurate.

By pulling on both matter and energy, gravity can give the universe shape and structure. It may be easiest to see how it does so if we stick with Newton’s intuitively simpler notion of gravity as a “force.” Newton showed that gravity can work at very large scales but is most powerful close-up. To be precise, the gravitational attraction between two objects is proportional to the (square of the) mass of the two objects, and is inversely proportional to the (square of the) distance between them. This means that gravity can pack closely packed masses even more closely together, but has less effect on objects separated by large distances. Gravity has even less impact on light, fast-moving objects such as the particles that carry energy, and thus it shapes matter more effectively than energy. Because its effects vary in these ways, gravity has managed to create many complex structures at a number of different scales. This is a remarkable conclusion, for it suggests that in some sense, and at some scales, gravity can temporarily counter the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental law that seems to guarantee that over time, the universe will become less ordered and less complex (see appendix 2). Instead, as gravitational energy is released (as gravity clumps matter together), the universe appears to become more ordered. Gravity is thus one of the major sources of order and pattern in our universe. In the rest of this chapter we will see how gravity created many of the complex objects studied by astronomers.

Much of the history of the early universe, and of the galaxies and stars, can be thought of as a product of competition between the force of the big bang, which drives the universe apart, and the force of gravity, which tends to draw the universe back together again. There is an unstable and shifting balance between these two forces, with expansion winning at the largest scales and gravity winning on smaller scales (up to the level of clusters of galaxies). But gravity needs some initial differences to work with. If the early universe had been perfectly smooth—if, say, hydrogen and helium had been distributed with absolute uniformity throughout the universe—gravity could have done little more than to slow down the rate at which the universe expanded. The universe would have remained homogenous; and complex, lumpy objects such as stars, planets, and … human beings could never have formed.

So it is important to know how homogenous the early universe was. Astronomers try to measure the “smoothness” of the early universe by looking for tiny differences in the temperature of the cosmic background radiation. Any “bumpiness” ought to show up as slight temperature differences in the cosmic background radiation. The COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite, launched early in the 1990s, was designed to look for such differences, and the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) satellite, launched in June 2001, is mapping these variations with even greater precision. COBE has shown that although the cosmic background radiation is extremely uniform, there are tiny variations in its temperature. Apparently, some areas of the early universe were slightly hotter and denser than others. These “wrinkles” gave gravity some differences to work with, and it did so by magnifying them, making dense regions even denser. Within a billion years after the big bang, gravity had created huge clouds of hydrogen and helium. These may have been as large as several clusters of galaxies, and locally, their gravitational pull would have been sufficient to counteract the expansionary drive of the universe. At larger scales, the expansionary force of the big bang remained dominant, so that over time the gaps between these massive clouds of matter increased.

Under the pull of their own gravity, the clouds of hydrogen and helium began to collapse in on themselves, as atoms of hydrogen and helium were packed ever more closely together. As the gas clouds shrank, some regions became denser than others and began to collapse more rapidly; in this way, the original clouds broke into smaller and smaller clumps at many different scales, from that of whole galaxies to single stars. As gravity packed each cloud into ever smaller spaces, pressure built up in the center. Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures, and so, as they shrank, each gas cloud began to heat up. Within the smaller clumps, which contained a mass equivalent to several thousand stars, there appeared regions of enormously high density and extreme heat; it was in pockets within these cosmic nurseries that the first stars were born.3

As the core regions heated up, the atoms within them moved faster and faster, and collided more and more violently. Eventually, the collisions were violent enough to overcome the electric repulsion between the positively charged nuclei of hydrogen atoms. (These repulsive forces depend partly on the number of protons, or positive charges, in the nuclei, so this reaction occurs most easily in hydrogen atoms and becomes progressively more difficult to achieve with larger atoms.) Wherever temperatures reached 10 million degrees C, pairs of hydrogen atoms fused to form helium atoms, each of which has two protons in its nucleus. This nuclear reaction, known as fusion, is what happens at the center of a hydrogen bomb. As hydrogen atoms fuse into helium, a tiny amount of matter is transformed into a huge amount of energy according to Einstein’s formula, E = mc2: the energy released is equal to the mass that is transformed multiplied by the speed of light squared. Because the speed of light is an enormous figure, Einstein’s equation tells us that an enormous amount of energy is released by the transformation of even tiny amounts of matter. To be precise, when hydrogen atoms fuse to form an atom of helium, they lose about 0.7 percent of their mass; we know this because a helium atom weighs less than the hydrogen atoms used to construct it. The lost mass has been converted into energy.4 Stars are like massive hydrogen bombs with so much fuel that their “explosions” can continue for millions or even billions of years. And this is how the first stars lit up the billion-year-long night of the early universe.

The colossal heat and energy generated by fusion reactions resist the force of gravity, so as they light up, young stars stop collapsing. And it is this balance between the expansionary force of the nuclear explosions at their center and the attractive force of gravity that tames the violent energies at the heart of all stars. Stars form durable structures because they are the result of a negotiated compromise between gravity, which crushes matter together, and the explosive force of fusion reactions, which forces matter apart. The negotiations are continuous; if the center heats up, the star expands and thus cools down—so it contracts again, in a negative feedback cycle analogous to that in an air-conditioning system. (If the air gets too hot, the system switches on and cools the air down again.) We can watch these negotiations in the pulsations of variable stars. But normally, the underlying truce endures for millions or billions of years, as long as the star exists.

The lighting up of the first stars was a momentous turning point in the history of the universe, for it marked the appearance of a new level of complexity, of new entities operating according to new rules. What had been billions and billions of atoms, drawn together by the force of gravity, suddenly became a new organized structure—one that could last for millions or billions of years. The moment of transition occurred when a slight increase in temperature ignited fusion reactions throughout the core of the proto-star, thereby transforming gravitational energy into heat energy and creating a new and more stable system of energy flows. Stars organize the atoms they contain into new, durable configurations, which can handle huge energy flows without disintegrating. This, we will see, is the characteristic pattern of all such thresholds. New configurations emerge quite suddenly as once independent entities are drawn into new and more ordered patterns, held together by an increasing throughput of free energy (see chapter 4). But, as is true of all these structures, they are held together only with difficulty, so none is eternal. New levels of complexity are characterized, therefore, by a certain fragility and by the certainty of eventual collapse. The second law of thermodynamics ensures that all complex entities will eventually die; but the simpler the structure, the better its survival chances, which is why stars live so much longer than humans (see appendix 2).

Many of the first stars are still around today, 13 billion years later. Most can be found in the centers of galaxies, or in the huge balls of stars known as globular clusters, which orbit most galaxies in large spherical tracks. The earliest stars probably formed during the chaotic and rapid collapse of relatively formless clouds of gas. They can be detected today by their erratic orbits and by the absence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, because those were the only elements available when they were formed. In the crowded early universe, embryonic galaxies often blended into each other, and these mergers help explain the erratic orbits of many of the oldest stars.

As galaxies formed and merged in the early universe, gravity went to work on them, sculpting many into a shape that is surprisingly common in the universe. As the ragged galaxies of the early universe were pulled together by gravity, different parts were dragged toward the center in huge arcs; and minor variations in the movements of these arcs ensured that each cloud began to spin, like water going down a drain. As each cloud contracted, the rotation accelerated, as happens when skaters fold in their arms. Like a spinning ball of dough, the areas spinning fastest were flung out by centrifugal force, and the entire cloud began to flatten into a sort of cosmic pizza. These simple processes, all dominated by the force of gravity, explain why so many of the largest clouds of matter in the universe, even at the scale of galaxy clusters, take the form of spinning disks, which the Soviet theorist Yakov Zel’dovich has called “crepes.” We will see that the same rules also operate at smaller scales, which is why our solar system would also look like a huge, flat disk if we could see it from a distance.

By the time a second generation of stars began to form, these processes had transformed some of the larger galaxies, such as the Milky Way, into huge and more or less regular disks. This change is reflected in the more orderly orbits of younger stars, such as our own sun, which, traveling at the stately speed of 800,000 kilometers an hour, takes about 225 million years to process once around the center of the Milky Way. Similar mechanisms shaped other galaxies, creating a universe populated by galaxies of stars, constructed in different ways but often forming regular, rotating disks. Star formation continues to the present day. In the Milky Way, about ten new stars are formed every year.





A COSMOLOGICAL MENAGERIE: BLACK HOLES, QUASARS, AND DARK MATTER




The early universe contained stranger objects than stars. At the center of most galaxies, densities were so great that huge clouds of matter and energy kept collapsing even at temperatures high enough to start fusion reactions. Here, gravity acquired such momentum that it crushed matter and energy out of existence, thereby forming the bodies called black holes. Black holes are regions of space so dense that no matter and no energy can escape their gravitational pull, not even light. This means we can never directly observe what goes on inside a black hole, except by entering it—and then, of course, we could never return to report our findings. Black holes are so dense that to form one from our earth, we would have to crush it into a ball with a diameter of about 0.7 inches.5

There has been much fascinating speculation about the true significance of black holes. Recently, for example, it has been suggested that black holes may be what new universes look like from the outside. Each may represent a separate universe, beginning with its own big bang. Lee Smolin has argued that if this is true, we may have an explanation for some other oddities of our universe. In particular, we may be able to explain why so many crucial parameters—such as the relative strength of the fundamental physical forces, or the relative size of fundamental nuclear particles—seem precisely tuned to create a universe capable of producing stars, elements, and complex entities such as ourselves. On Smolin’s assumptions, only universes that can produce black holes can have “offspring.” If we add a further assumption, that new universes differ only slightly from their “parent” universe, we see that a process akin to Darwinian selection may be at work.6 After many generations, the hyperspace in which these many universes exist is likely to be dominated by those universes that have the precise qualities needed to produce black holes, however statistically improbable these universes may be, because all other universes will be sterile. But if a universe can produce black holes, it can probably produce other large objects as well, such as stars, and many other kinds of complex structures besides. Such ideas suggest that there may be new levels to our modern creation myth above the level of the universe, and that a “hyperuniverse” could exist that is far older than 13 billion years, and much bigger than our universe. But at present, we have no way of proving or disproving these grandiose ideas.

So we can safely return from these speculations to the universe we know. Black holes can tell us some important things about our own universe and the galaxies that populate it. They are so dense that the gravitational forces they exert can generate energies much larger than those produced within stars. It is likely that a black hole lurks at the center of the Milky Way, 27,000 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It may be identified with a powerful source of radio waves known as Sagittarius A, and it probably has a mass about 2.5 million times that of our own sun.

The existence of black holes at the center of many galaxies may help explain another strange object, the quasar, or “quasistellar radio source.” The first quasars, the brightest objects known to modern astronomy, were detected by Australian astronomers in 1962. They shine more brightly than even the largest galaxies, though they are no larger than our solar system. They are also extremely remote. Most are more than 10 billion light-years away, and none is closer than 2 billion light-years from us. So when we look at quasars, we are seeing objects that existed early in the universe’s life. Currently, it seems likely that their energy comes from huge black holes that suck in large amounts of matter from the galactic material surrounding them. Quasars thus consist of black holes plus star food. Quasars were particularly numerous early in the life of the universe, because at that time galaxies were crowded more closely together, and black holes were better fed. Since then, the universe has expanded, galaxy clusters have moved farther apart, and the pickings have become leaner for galactic black holes. So, though most galaxies may still have black holes at their centers, few of these beasts now consume enough to create quasars. And as most quasars do not live more than a few million years because of their prodigious appetite for star dust, they are rare in the modern universe. Quasars are the astronomical equivalent of dinosaurs, though the black holes that powered them still survive at the centers of most galaxies, waiting for unwary stars to fall into their clutches.

Galaxies and stars make up most of the visible universe. But observations of the movements of galaxies and galaxy clusters have led to the embarrassing conclusion that we are seeing only a tiny part of what is actually out there. Indeed, what we can see may constitute no more than 10 percent, and perhaps as little as 1 percent, of the matter in the universe. Using the basic laws of gravity, astronomers can calculate roughly how much matter is in a group of galaxies by studying the way they rotate, and such studies show that galaxies contain perhaps ten times as much matter as we can see. Astronomers refer to this matter as dark matter, which is really a way of expressing their puzzlement.

Finding out what makes up this huge amount of material is one of the central projects of modern astronomy. At present, there are two main types of candidate. First, it may consist of tiny particles, each much smaller than electrons but collectively more massive than all other forms of matter. These are known as WIMPs, or “weakly interacting massive [in the sense of having mass] particles.” The current best bet for such a particle is the neutrino, a particle that may or may not have any mass. If it does have mass, it is no more than 1/500,000th the mass of an electron. However, there are about one billion neutrinos for every other particle, so that even if their individual mass is tiny, they may make up most of the material in the universe. If we could see neutrinos, the universe would seem like a huge neutrino fog, contaminated by tiny specks of matter. Alternatively, there may be many large objects that we cannot see because they do not emit light or other forms of radiation. These may consist of the corpses of stars, or planetlike objects. These are referred to as MACHOs, or “massive compact halo objects.” Recently, a third possibility has emerged, which may offer an elegant solution to the problem of dark matter: dark matter may really be dark energy. As we have seen, energy also exerts a gravitational pull. So perhaps the so-called vacuum energy discovered in the late 1990s, which seems to be accelerating the rate at which the universe is expanding, constitutes as much as 70 percent of the mass/energy of the universe. If so, it may account for most of the extra gravitational pull observed by astronomers. In this scenario, dark matter may account for no more than 25 percent of all the stuff in the universe, while the visible universe makes up merely 5 percent.7





THE LIFE AND DEATH OF STARS




Stars, like people, have biographies. They are born, they live, they change, and they die. And today we know a great deal about the typical life cycles of stars. This knowledge is derived largely from studying the spectra of starlight. As we saw in the previous chapter, careful analysis of the absorption bands (the frequencies at which energy has been absorbed as it travels through stars) can tell us much about the materials within stars. It can also tell us how hot they are. As astronomers have studied the spectra of more and more stars over the last century, they have built up a picture of the different stages of a star’s life, and of the different types of stars that can exist.

The most important single feature of stars is their size, or rather the size of the initial cloud of material from which they form. This determines many features of a star, including its brightness, temperature, color, and life span. If the initial cloud is smaller than about 8 percent of our own sun’s size, its center will never get dense or hot enough to fuse hydrogen, and no star will form. At best, there may appear a brown dwarf: an object with a faint glow, a bit like the planet Jupiter. Brown dwarves are half planet and half star, though recent observations of orbiting material around them suggest they are formed in much the same way as stars even if they are never quite large enough to ignite.8 On the other hand, if the initial cloud is more than 60 to 100 times the size of our sun, it is likely to split into two or more regions of star formation as it collapses, which explains the large number of double or multiple star systems observed by astronomers. Between these extremes, it is helpful to think of two main sizes: the majority of stars, which range from much smaller than the Sun to about 8 times its size, and those that are between 8 and 60 times the size of our sun.

The amount of material in the embryonic star cloud determines the gravitational pull of the cloud, the speed with which it shrinks, and the density and heat at its center. The heat at the center of a new star determines the speed at which it burns up its available fuel. Thus large stars are much hotter than small stars; though they contain more material, they also burn their fuel more rapidly, live more dangerously, and die sooner. Stars 10 times larger than our sun may have life spans of a mere 30 million years, while even larger stars may live for only a few hundred thousand years. Smaller stars, from twice the size of our sun down to its size, have less dense and therefore cooler cores. So they burn their fuel more prudently. The smallest stars may have life spans of hundreds of billions of years, many times the present age of the universe.

Most stars, like our sun, burn their fuel more slowly than the giants. But eventually, they use up their hydrogen, and their cores fill with helium. At that point, the fusion reactions using hydrogen, which have sustained the star during most of its life, can continue no longer. The central region starts to cool and to collapse in on itself. But the collapse increases the internal pressure, which causes the star’s interior to heat up again, so that the star seems to rebound, swelling to many times its previous size. If the star is large enough, the initial collapse may raise the temperatures at its core to 100 million degrees C. At this temperature, new fusion reactions begin that use helium as their initial fuel. But these reactions convert much less mass to energy than hydrogen fusion, so they don’t last as long. Stars run out of helium quite quickly; and when they do, the center collapses again and the outer layers swell even further, sometimes being thrown out into space. A series of reactions of this kind, each requiring higher temperatures, produces many new elements, the most abundant of which are carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Our sun, for example, will maintain this sequence until it starts producing carbon, but will go no further, while slightly larger bodies may be able to maintain the sequence up to oxygen. In this way, aging stars create many of the elements in the early parts of the periodic table; the largest stars of all manage, in their final stages, to produce iron (atomic number 26), whose creation requires temperatures of between 4,000 and 6,000 million degrees. This sequence of reactions ends with iron. When old stars die, their ashes, containing all these new elements, are scattered around them, creating stellar graveyards that are more complex, chemically, than any region of the early universe.

In their dying phases, many stars swell into red supergiants; an example is Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. When our sun reaches this phase, in about 5 billion years, it will expand so much that both Earth and Mars will be within its outer layers. (Betelgeuse is so large that if it were placed where our sun is, the earth would be buried halfway between its center and its surface.) Eventually, when they run out of fuel, small- to medium-sized stars begin to cool, turning eventually into star cinders known as white dwarfs. They are extremely dense, and closer in size to earthlike planets than to stars. Over billions of years, most of them cool down, and their lives as stars ends.

Giant stars, larger than about 8 times the size of our sun, have even more dramatic life histories. Because these stars are large, the pressure and temperature at their cores are much higher, so they can manufacture elements up to silicon and, as noted above, even iron. In their final stages, they make different elements, layer by layer, in a frenetic attempt to keep pumping out energy and to avoid gravitational collapse. But when they finally run out of fuel, their end is much more spectacular than that of medium-sized stars. When they have no more energy to support themselves, gravity takes over and folds them up in a sudden and catastrophic collapse that may last no more than a second. This creates the phenomenon known as a supernova. So much energy is generated in a supernova explosion that, for a few weeks, it may shine with the energy of 100 billion stars, or an entire galaxy. If the original star is less than 30 times the size of our sun, its collapse may leave behind a neutron star. These are objects whose atoms have been crushed so tightly together that their electrons fuse with protons and turn them into neutrons. In neutron stars, an object with the mass of our sun may be concentrated into an area the size of a large modern city. Neutron stars can spin at rates as fast as 600 times a second. They were first detected on Earth (in 1967) as pulsars, because, as they spin (if that happens to be at an angle convenient for Earth-bound astronomers), the energy they emit seems to strike Earth in short pulses. The Crab Nebula contains a neutron star that spins 30 times each second, and is the remnant of a supernova explosion detected by Chinese astronomers in 1054 CE.

Stars more than about 30 times the size of our sun collapse even more violently, and their core regions may be crushed into a black hole. Just outside the core, protons and electrons are combined to form neutrons, and a huge stream of neutrons and neutrinos flees the dying star. This vast pulse creates a cauldron with temperatures of several billion degrees. Momentarily, in the extraordinarily high temperatures of a supernova, a new threshold of some kind is crossed, for in this furnace it is possible to bake elements much heavier than iron. Indeed, in a few moments, supernova explosions can manufacture all the elements of the periodic table, up to uranium. These are then blasted deep into space. The elements that dominate this galactic alchemy are oxygen and lesser amounts of neon, magnesium, and silicon, which, as a result, are some of the commonest heavier elements in interstellar space. The most recent supernova of this type was detected on Earth in February 1987; it was the brightest supernova to be observed from Earth since 1604, when one exploded within the Milky Way. The supernova whose light reached us in 1987 was in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy that can be seen in the southern sky. It marked the death throes of a star previously known as Sanduleak -69 202; in its final, red giant phase, it had a diameter about 40 times that of our sun. This supernova blew up about 160,000 light-years away from us, which means that it actually occurred 160,000 years ago. Many “new stars” recorded earlier in human history may also have been supernovae, including the star reported at the birth of Jesus. Because large stars have short lives, supernovae have been fertilizing interstellar space with new chemicals since the formation of the earliest galaxies. The gold or silver ring you may be wearing was made in a supernova. Without supernovae, we could not exist.9

There is a second kind of supernova, known as a Ia supernova, which is created by the explosion of white dwarf stars fed with new material from neighboring stars. These explosions are even brighter than the supernovae created by the death of large stars, and they eject particularly large amounts of iron, along with other heavy elements.

The story of star deaths is a vital part of the story of life on earth, for stars created both the raw materials from which our world is created and the energy that fuels the biosphere. The heavier elements scattered throughout the galaxy were first formed in stars and in supernovae. As the universe aged, the proportion of new elements (other than hydrogen and helium) has steadily increased. Without the chemically rich environment created by stars and supernovae, our earth could not have been born, and life could not have evolved. So, the chemicals we are made from were created in three distinct stages: while most hydrogen and helium was created during the big bang, most elements from carbon (atomic number 6) to iron (atomic number 26) were formed inside medium and large stars, and most other elements were formed in supernovae. The first generation of stars, formed in the early universe, could not possibly have sustained life. But later generations of stars, such as our own sun, could.

The energy that drives the biosphere is also derived largely from stars. Direct sunlight is one of the most important of all sources of energy on Earth. But for humans in the past two centuries, the sunlight stored long ago in coal and oil has been almost as important. In addition, many important processes on the earth are driven by the earth’s internal heat engine, whose heat was generated partly during the formation of our sun and comes partly from radioactive elements created in supernovae. In all these ways, the life histories of stars are a vital component of the story of life on Earth.





CREATION OF OUR SUN




Like all stars, our sun was born in the gravitational collapse of a cloud of matter. A nearby supernova probably triggered the collapse. The shock waves from this huge explosion rippled through gas clouds that had formed in a region of our galaxy’s spiral arm, about 27,000 light-years from its center, or 40 percent of the way to its edge. As they did so, the material in these clouds was rearranged, like sand on the vibrating surface of a drum. In this way, a whole stellar tribe was born, with hundreds of new stars.

All of them count as second- or third-generation stars, for they formed from material that contained many other elements in addition to hydrogen and helium. The primordial gases accounted for 98 percent of the material in the cloud from which our sun formed (hydrogen made up ca. 72 percent; helium, ca. 27 percent). But many other elements were also present, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (which now account for 1.4 percent of all matter in the universe), and also iron, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and neon (which account for another 0.5 percent). These ten elements, all created either during the big bang or within large stars, represent all but 0.03 percent of the mass of atomic matter in our part of the galaxy, while the remaining elements were created in supernovae.10 The presence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, as well as many simple chemicals formed from these elements, explains why, unlike the first generation of stars, our sun (and perhaps many of its sibling stars) was born with an attendant group of satellites. These are the planets of the solar system (see chapter 3).

As with all stars, many features of the Sun are determined by its size. It is a yellow star (spectral type G2), which means that it falls in the middle of the range of brightness of stars. However, most stars (about 95 percent) are smaller and cooler than the Sun.11 It is extremely big compared to the earth. Its diameter of almost 1.4 million kilometers is more than 4 times the distance from the earth to the Moon. Nevertheless, our sun is not large enough to collapse into a supernova when it dies. But it is not small enough to live to a very old age. It was born about 4.6 billion years ago, and will live for another 4 to 5 billion years. It has existed for about a third of the life of the universe and is halfway through its own life cycle. Like all stars, it is powered by a huge, stable, nuclear explosion in its core, whose temperature is about 15 million degrees. Here, atoms of hydrogen fuse into helium, releasing large amounts of radiant energy. It can take a million years for the photons of energy produced in these reactions to fight their way through the dense core of the Sun and appear at the surface. There, the temperature is a modest 6,000°C. From the surface, energy is radiated throughout the solar system and deep into space. Once photons reach the surface of the Sun they begin to move with the speed of light. After struggling through a traffic jam of subatomic particles for 1 million years, it takes photons of light just over 8 minutes to reach Earth, 150 million kilometers away.

Without the Sun, our earth could not have existed and life could not have evolved. All the planets of our solar system were made from the Sun’s debris and constructed within its gravitational field. And the Sun provides most of the light and heat energy that sustains life on Earth. It is the battery that drives the complex geological, atmospheric, and biological processes on the surface of our planet.





THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE




The universe started out unimaginably small, and is now unimaginably large. Somehow or other, to make sense of the story of its creation, we have to try to grasp the spatial as well as the temporal scales on which this story has been told. We can never fully comprehend these scales, but it is worth making the effort.

If the universe is 13 billion years old, this means we cannot see anything farther away from us than 13 billion light-years, for nothing can travel faster than light, and that is as far as light could have traveled since the origins of the universe. But the universe may, in fact, be bigger than this, because the notion of inflation suggests that in the first second of its existence, the space-time in which the universe is embedded expanded much faster than the speed of light. If so, the real universe may be billions of billions of times larger than the observable universe. Indeed, if different parts expanded in different ways, there may be billions of different universes, each with slightly differently physical laws.

In practice, of course, even the size of the visible universe is impossible to grasp. To get from the size of the smallest subatomic particle to the largest known cluster of galaxies, we must multiply by ten 36 times. The largest galaxy cluster is 1036 times the size of the smallest known particle.12 Such statements mean little to us; to even begin thinking about these scales, we have to make a special imaginative effort. It may help to use a thought experiment that can shock us into some appreciation of very large scales.

Large galaxies such as the Milky Way contain something like 100 billion stars each. Larger galaxies may contain up to 1,000 billion, while the more numerous dwarf galaxies may contain as few as 10 million, so 100 billion may adequately approximate the average galaxy size. As far as we know, there are also something like 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. How large is 100 billion? Imagine a pile of 100 billion rice grains: it would be large enough to fill a building the size of the Sydney Opera House.13 That suggests how many stars there are in just our own galaxy. To represent the number of stars in the entire visible universe, you would have to build a hundred billion opera houses, each filled with rice grains. (This total number of rice grains may be roughly equivalent to the number of grains of sand on all the deserts and beaches of the earth.)14 But let us concentrate on the one opera house, imagining that it represents our own galaxy, the Milky Way. If we now use the rice grains to make a scale model of the Milky Way, what would be the distance from our star, sitting in the center of the Sydney Opera House, to the closest rice grain? The nearest star to us is Proxima Centauri, which is part of the triple star system of Alpha Centauri, the third-brightest starlike object in the night sky. If our sun were the size of a rice grain in the Sydney Opera house, Proxima Centauri would be near the Australian city of Newcastle, about 100 kilometers away, which represents a mere 4.35 light-years (more than 40,000 billion km or ca. 25,000 billion miles). Altogether, about twenty-six stars lie within 12 light-years of Earth. (One is Sirius, which appears as the brightest star in our sky partly because it is so close—only 8.6 light-years away—and partly because it is more than twice as massive as our sun and twenty-three times as bright.) To begin grasping the size of just our own galaxy, we must imagine all the rice grains in the Opera House spaced out on this scale.

Here’s another way of trying to grasp these scales. A jumbo jet takes about four or five hours to cross a large continent like Australia or the continental United States. How long would it take the same jet to reach the Sun? (How many airline dinners would we have to eat before we got there?) In a Boeing 747 cruising at ca. 900 kilometers (550 miles) per hour, it would take us almost twenty years to reach the Sun, which is ca. 150 million kilometers (ca. 95 million miles) away. To reach our closest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, would take the same jumbo jet over 5 million years! This is the distance between next-door neighbors in a galactic city of 100 billion stars. To get a feeling for the size of the entire galaxy, the Milky Way, remember that it takes light only 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun, but would take about 4 years and 4 months to reach Proxima Centauri. The same light beam would have to travel for another 30,000 years, or 10,000 times the distance to Proxima Centauri, before it would reach the center of our galaxy.

Though rough-and-ready, these thought experiments may help us begin to imagine how large the universe is. They also suggest how small, in absolute terms, are the scales that normally concern us as human beings. On the scale of the universe, our sun and earth are infinitely small specks of matter.

These calculations suggest something else that is important for understanding human history The placing of our earth within the universe is by no means random. We can exist only because we are in an atypical region. Most of space is empty and cold. Indeed, our thought experiments were concerned with a galaxy, a region of space that contains unusual amounts of matter. Beyond galaxies, matter is much less dense. Our earth exists within a region unusually rich in matter, in a large galaxy, in which supernovae have generated a broad variety of elements. Within that galaxy, we live in a region of star formation, close to a mature star. Even in the densest part of the galaxy, the disk, regions of empty space normally contain only about one atom in each cubic centimeter. But in the earth’s atmosphere, there may be 25 billion billion molecules in the same space.15 And pouring though this matter is the energy emitted every second by the Sun. In other words, human history has taken place in a pocket of the universe that is dense in matter and packed with energy. It is the extraordinary richness and complexity of this environment that made life possible.





SUMMARY




After about 300,000 years, the early universe consisted mainly of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium. These contained the raw materials from which future stars and galaxies were to be created. About a billion years after the universe formed, the first stars appeared in regions where hydrogen and helium were more concentrated. Gravity pulled these dense clouds of gas into flat, rotating disks at many different scales. At the smallest scales were clouds of matter roughly the size of our solar system. As they collapsed, their centers heated up until the hydrogen at the center began to fuse into helium. These nuclear reactions released energy that prevented the center from collapsing further, and created the stable cores of stars. Stars burn hydrogen. Once that is used up, large stars can burn helium and even more complex elements up to iron, at which point further fusion demands more energy than is available. The largest stars burn their fuel fast and eventually collapse in the huge explosions known as supernovae. It is within supernovae that most of the more complex chemical elements are created. Smaller stars burn more slowly and at lower temperatures, they live longer, and they eventually cool more gradually, like cinders, when they have run out of fuel.

We live in a universe that has been made much more complex chemically by the life and death of stars. Indeed, the complex objects that dominate our earth and our history could not have existed in the much simpler environment of the early universe.
