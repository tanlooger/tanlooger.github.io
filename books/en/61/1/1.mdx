ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE, TIME, AND SPACE




Viola: What country, friends, is this?

Captain: This is Illyria, lady.





THE PROBLEM OF BEGINNINGS




How did everything begin? This is the first question faced by any creation myth and, despite the achievements of modern cosmology, answering it remains tricky.

At the very beginning, all explanations face the same problem: how can something come out of nothing? The problem is general, for beginnings are inexplicable. At the smallest scales, subatomic particles sometimes emerge instantaneously from nothingness. One moment there is nothing; the next moment there is something. There is no in-between state. Quantum physics can analyze these odd jumps into and out of existence with great precision, but it cannot explain them in ways that make sense at the human level. These paradoxes are captured beautifully in a modern Australian Aboriginal saying: “Nothing is nothing.”1

Awareness of the difficulty of explaining origins is as old as myth. The following passage poses these questions with great sophistication and a surprisingly modern skepticism. It comes from one of the ancient Indian hymns known as the Rig-Veda, and was probably composed ca. 1200 BCE. It describes a pre-creation realm that was not really present, but was not entirely absent either.



There was neither non-existence nor existence then; there was neither the realm of space nor the sky which is beyond. What stirred? Where? In whose protection? Was there water, bottomlessly deep?

There was neither death nor immortality then. There was no distinguishing sign of night nor of day. That one breathed, windless, by its own impulse. Other than that there was nothing beyond… .

Was there below? Was there above? There were seed-placers; there were powers. There was impulse beneath; there was giving-forth above.

Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen?

Whence this creation has arisen—perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not—the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows—or perhaps he does not know.2





Here we have a hint that there was, first, a sort of potent nothingness—waiting, like clay in a potter’s yard, to be formed into something. This is very much how modern nuclear physics views the idea of a vacuum: it is empty but can nevertheless have shape and structure, and (as has been proved in experiments with particle accelerators) “things” and “energies” can pop out of the emptiness.

Perhaps there was a potter (or potters) waiting to shape the vacuum. And perhaps the potter and the clay were somehow identical. According to the Popol Vuh, or “Council Book,” a sixteenth-century Mayan manuscript, “Whatever might be is simply not there: only murmurs, ripples, in the dark, in the night. Only the Maker, Modeler alone, Sovereign Plumed Serpent, the Bearers, Begetters are in the water, a glittering light. They are there, they are enclosed in quetzal feathers, in blue-green.”3 But where did the Maker come from? Each beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. In monotheistic religions, such as Christianity or Islam, the problem arises as soon as you ask, How was God created? Instead of meeting a single starting point, we encounter an infinity of them, each of which poses the same problem.

There are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma. What we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery, some way of “pointing at the moon,” in the Zen metaphor. And we have to do so using words. Yet the words we reach for, from God to gravity, are inadequate to the task. So we have to use language poetically or symbolically; and such language, whether used by a scientist, a poet, or a shaman, can easily be misunderstood. A French anthropologist, Marcel Griaule, once questioned a Dogon wise man, Ogotemmeli, about a mythic detail according to which many animals were crowded together onto a single, small step (like the animals in Noah’s ark). Ogotemmeli replied, with some irritation: “All of this has to be said in words, but everything on the step is a symbol… . Any number of symbols could find room on a one-cubit step.” The word translated here as “symbol” could also be translated as “word of this lower world.”4 At the very beginning of things, language itself threatens to break down.

One of the trickiest problems concerns time. Was there a “time” when there was no time? Is time a product of our imagination?5 In some systems of thought, time does not really exist. Places become the source of everything significant, and the paradoxes of creation take different forms.6 But for communities that see time as central, there is no way of avoiding the paradox of origins. The following is an Islamic summary of a Zoroastrian attempt to deal with these riddles. In it, the creator is an unchanging entity called Time, who creates a universe of change. It is dominated by two opposite principles, those of the gods Ohrmazd and Ahriman.



Except Time all other things are created. Time is the creator; and Time has no limit, neither top nor bottom. It has always been and shall be for evermore. No sensible person will say whence Time has come. In spite of all the grandeur that surrounded it, there was no one to call it creator; for it had not brought forth creation. Then it created fire and water; and when it had brought them together, Ohrmazd came into existence, and simultaneously Time became Creator and Lord with regard to the creation it had brought forth. Ohrmazd was bright, pure, sweet-smelling, and beneficent, and had power over all good things. Then, he looked down, he saw Ahriman ninety-six thousand parasangs away, black, foul, stinking, and maleficent; and it appeared fearful to Ohrmazd, for he was a frightful enemy. And when Ohrmazd saw this enemy, he thought thus: “I must utterly destroy this enemy,” and he considered with what and how many instruments he could destroy him. Then did Ohrmazd begin the work of creation. Whatever Ohrmazd did, he did with the aid of Time; for all the excellence that Ohrmazd needed, had (already) been created.7





Time, like pattern, means difference, if no more than the difference between then and now. So this story, like most creation stories, is really about the emergence of difference from an original sameness. In this version, as in many creation myths, difference begins with a fundamental clash of opposites.

One of the more poetic solutions to these paradoxes is to think of creation as a sort of awakening. A story from the Karraru people of southern Australia describes how, originally, the earth was still, silent, and dark. However, “Inside a deep cave below the Nullarbor Plain slept a beautiful woman, the Sun. The Great Father Spirit gently woke her and told her to emerge from her cave and stir the universe into life. The Sun Mother opened her eyes and darkness disappeared as her rays spread over the land; she took a breath and the atmosphere changed, the air gently vibrated as a small breeze blew.” The Sun Mother then goes on a long journey during which her rays awaken all the various creatures and plants that have been sleeping.8 Such a story suggests that creation is not a single event but has to be constantly repeated; and, as we will see, this is a truth we all experience. The paradoxes of creation are repeated each time we observe something new, from galaxies to stars to solar systems and life. And many of us also experience our own personal origins, the moments of our earliest memories, as a sort of awakening from nothingness.

Modern science has approached the problem of origins in many different ways, some more satisfying than others. In A Brief History of Time (1988), Stephen Hawking suggests that the question of origins is just badly posed. If we think of time as a line, it is natural to ask about its beginning. But what if the universe has a different shape? Perhaps time is more like a circle. There is no sense in asking if a circle has a beginning or an end, just as there is no point in asking what is to the north of the North Pole. There is no beyond, no boundary, and everything about the universe is perfectly self-contained. As Hawking puts it: “The boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary.”9 Many creation myths adopt a similar approach, perhaps because they arise in societies that do not think of time as a straight line. As we look back in time, the past seems to fade away into what modern Aboriginal myths call a “Dreamtime.” It is as if the past turned a corner beyond which we cannot see it anymore, however hard we try. The same is true if we look forward, so it seems as if in some sense the future and the past may meet.10 Mircea Eliade describes similar visions of time in a difficult but fascinating work, The Myth of the Eternal Return (1954).11

In modern societies, which usually envisage time as a line rather than a curve, such solutions may seem artificial. Perhaps, instead, the universe is eternal. We can look back along the line of time as long as we like, but we will always find a universe, so the problem of origins does not really arise. Religions of the Indian subcontinent, in particular, have tended to adopt this strategy. So has the steady state theory, the most serious modern alternative to big bang cosmology. And so does a recent theory, proposed by Lee Smolin, that suggests the existence of universes that breed other universes whenever they create black holes, in a repetitive or “algorithmic” process analogous to Darwinian evolution, which ensures that they “evolve” in ways that increase the possibility of creating complex entities such as ourselves (see chapter 2).12 Similar arguments are common in modern cosmology, and what they imply is that the universe we see may be merely one tiny atom in a much larger “multiverse.” But such approaches are also unsatisfying, because they still leave the nagging question, How did such eternal processes themselves begin? How was an eternal universe created?

Or we can return to the idea of a creator. Within Christianity, it was generally agreed that the Creator made the universe a few thousand years ago. In one famous calculation, a Dr. Lightfoot from Cambridge “proved” that God had created humans at exactly 9:00 AM on 23 October 4004 BCE.13 Many other creation myths also introduce deities who created the world, working like potters, or builders, or clockmakers. This approach solves much of the problem, but leaves open the basic question of how the gods themselves were created. Once again, we seem forced back to an infinite regress.

A final position is skepticism. This entails a frank admission that at a certain point, we must run out of knowledge. Human knowledge, by its nature, has limits, so some questions must remain mysteries. Some religions treat such mysteries as secrets that the gods choose to hide from humans; others, such as Buddhism, treat them as ultimate riddles that are not worth pursuing. We will see that modern cosmology also opts for skepticism at the beginning of its story, though it offers a very confident account of how our universe evolved once it was created.





EARLY SCIENTIFIC ACCOUNTS OF THE UNIVERSE




Modern science tries to answer questions about origins using carefully tested data and rigorous logic. Though many pioneering scientists, like Newton, were Christians who believed deeply in the existence of a deity, they also felt the Deity was rational, so their task was to tease out the underlying laws by which the Deity had created the world. This meant trying to explain the world as if there were no deity. Modern science, unlike most other traditions of knowledge, tries to explain the universe as if it were inanimate, as if things happened without intention or purpose.

The Christian view of the universe owed much to the ideas of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Though some Greeks had argued that the earth orbited the Sun, Aristotle placed the earth at the center of the universe and surrounded it with a series of transparent spheres, each revolving at a different speed. The spheres held the planets, the Sun, and the stars. This model sounds quaint today, but it was given a rigorous mathematical basis by Ptolemy in the second century CE, and in this form it proved good at predicting planetary motions. Christianity added the further idea that this universe had been created perhaps 6,000 years ago by God, in the course of five days. In sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, the Ptolemaic story began to break down. Copernicus gave some powerful reasons for thinking that the earth revolved around the Sun, and the heretical monk Giordano Bruno argued that stars were suns and that the universe was probably infinite in extent. In the seventeenth century, scientists such as Newton and Galileo explored many of the implications of these ideas, while retaining as much as they could of the biblical creation story.

During the eighteenth century, the Ptolemaic view of the universe finally collapsed. In its place, there emerged a new picture of a universe operating according to strict, rational, and impersonal laws that could, in principle, be discovered by science. God may have created it, perhaps in time; perhaps, in some sense, out of time. But then he left it to run almost entirely according to its own logic and rules. Newton assumed that both time and space were absolutes, providing the ultimate frames of reference for the universe. It was widely accepted that both might be infinite, and thus the universe had neither a definable edge nor a time of origin. In this way, God was moved further and further away from the story of origins.

But there were problems. One arose from the theory of thermodynamics, which suggested that the amount of usable energy in the universe was constantly diminishing (or that entropy was constantly increasing; see appendix 2). In an infinitely old universe the consequence would be that no usable energy was left to create anything—yet clearly that was not true. Perhaps, this might have suggested, the universe was not infinitely old. The night sky posed another problem. As early as 1610, the astronomer Johannes Kepler pointed out that if there were an infinite number of stars, the night sky should be infinitely bright. The problem is now known as Other’s paradox, after a nineteenth-century German astronomer who publicized the problem more widely. One possible solution was to suppose that the universe was not infinitely large. That would solve Olber’s paradox—but would create another; for as Newton had pointed out, if the universe were not infinitely large, then gravity ought to draw all the matter into the center of the universe, like oil in a sump. And that, fortunately, was not what astronomers observed when they studied the night sky.

Of course, all scientific theories contain problems. But as long as the theories can answer most of the questions put to them, such difficulties can be ignored. And the problems faced by the Newtonian theory were largely ignored in the nineteenth century.





THE BIG BANG: FROM PRIMORDIAL CHAOS TO THE FIRST SIGNS OF ORDER




In the first half of the twentieth century, evidence began to accumulate for an alternative theory that we now know as big bang cosmology. It solved the problem of entropy by suggesting the universe was not infinitely old; it solved Olber’s paradox by describing a universe that was finite in both time and space; and it solved the paradox of gravity by showing that the universe was expanding too fast for gravity to gather everything into a single lump (yet!). Big bang cosmology described a universe with a beginning and a history, so it turned cosmology into a historical science, an account of change and evolution.

According to this view, the universe began as an inhnitesimally small entity, which expanded rapidly and continues to expand today In form, at least, this account is similar to the traditional creation myths known as emergence myths. In such accounts, the universe develops, like an egg or an embryo, through distinct stages from a remote and perhaps undehnable point of origin, and under the control of internal laws of development. In 1927, one of the pioneers of big bang cosmology, Georges Lemaitre, referred to the early universe as the “primordial atom.” Like all emergence myths, the modern account implies that the universe was created at a particular time, that it has a life story of its own, and that it may die in the distant future. The new theory could explain many of the difficulties encountered by previous theories. For example, it could explain Olber’s paradox by showing that the universe had not existed forever; and because light has a finite speed (as Einstein had shown), light from the most distant galaxies might not reach us during the entire life of the universe. The theory was also consistent with the torrent of new information and data about stars, matter, and energy that was generated in the early twentieth century. But at its very beginning, it too has to fall back on a sense of inexplicable mystery.

The modern story of origins goes something like this.14 The universe was created about 13 billion (13,000,000,000) years ago.15 (How long ago is that? If each human being were to live exactly the biblical span of 70 years, it would take about 200 million human life spans laid end to end to reach back this far in time. For more on these huge timescales, see appendix 1.) About the beginning, we can say nothing with any certainty except that something appeared. We do not know why or how it appeared. We cannot say whether anything existed before. We cannot even say that there was a “before” or a “space” for anything to exist in, for (in an argument anticipated by St. Augustine in the fifth century CE) time and space may have been created at the same time as matter and energy. So, we can say nothing definite about the moment of the big bang, or about any earlier period.

However, beginning a tiny fraction of a second after the big bang, modern science can offer a rigorous and coherent story, based on abundant evidence. Many of the most interesting “events” occurred within a fraction of a second. Indeed, it may be helpful to think of time itself as stretched out during these early moments, so that a billionth of a billionth of a second then was as significant, in its way, as many billions of years in the later history of the universe.16

In the beginning, the universe was tiny, perhaps smaller than an atom. (How small is that? The physicist Richard Feynman illustrated the size of an atom by saying that if you blew up an apple until it was the size of Earth, each of the atoms it was made from would now be the size of the original apple.)17 The temperature of this atom-sized universe was many trillions of degrees. At this temperature, matter and energy are interchangeable—as Einstein showed, matter is really little more than a congealed form of energy Here, in this fantastically dense flux of energy/matter, we come close to the primordial chaos of so many traditional creation myths. But in the modern account, this tiny universe was expanding at a staggering speed, and it was this expansion that gave rise to the first differences and the first patterns.18 The theory of inflation asserts that for a fraction of a second, between ca. 10−34 and 10−32 seconds after the big bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light (which is about 300,000 kilometers per second), driven apart by some form of “antigravity.” The magnitudes involved in such processes are inconceivable: before inflation, the entire universe may have been smaller than an atom; after inflation (a fraction of an instant later), it may have been larger than a galaxy. Inflation seems to ensure that most of the universe is beyond our observation, as light from most of the universe will be too distant ever to reach us. The parts of the universe we can see may be only a tiny part of the real universe. As Timothy Ferris puts it: “If the entirety of an inflationary universe were the surface of the earth, the observable part would be smaller than a proton.”19

As the universe expanded, it became less homogenous. Its original symmetry was broken, distinct patterns appeared, and matter and energy began to assume forms that we can recognize today. Modern nuclear physics can tell at what temperatures particular types of energy or matter appear, just as most of us can tell at what temperature water will turn into ice. So, if we can estimate how fast the universe cooled, then we can estimate when different forces and particles emerged from the flux of the early universe. Within the first second, quarks appeared, and from these were constructed protons and neutrons, the main constituents of atomic nuclei. Quarks and atomic nuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces that rule our universe.

At this point in the modern creation story (still less than of a second after the big bang), there occurs a display of extravagance that is remarkable even by the extravagant standards of most creation myths. Particles appeared in two forms, to make up almost equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Particles of antimatter are identical to particles of matter except for having the opposite electrical charge. Unfortunately, when the two meet, they annihilate each other and 100 percent of their mass is transformed into energy. So, during the first second after the big bang there played out a perverse subatomic game of musical chairs, in which quarks were the players, antiquarks were the chairs, and the winner was the one quark in a billion that couldn’t find an antiparticle chair. The matter left to construct our universe was made from the one in a billion particles that didn’t find an antimatter partner. The particles that did find a partner were transformed into pure energy, and that energy pervades the universe today, in the form of cosmic background radiation.20 And this process may explain why there are about a billion photons of energy for every particle of matter in the universe today.

Now the pace slows. Some seconds after the big bang, electrons appeared. Electrons carry a negative electrical charge, while protons (which are made up of quarks) carry a positive charge. Relations between electrons and protons were controlled by a second fundamental force, the electromagnetic force, which also appeared within the first second of the universe’s history. In the hot early universe, the photons of energy that carry the electromagnetic force were entangled with charged particles of matter. The universe was rather like the interior of the Sun today: a white-hot sea of particles and photons in constant interaction. The entire universe would have been crackling with the energy generated by constant interactions between positive protons and negative electrons and light. In this “era of radiation,” as Eric Chaisson explains, matter existed as no more than “a relatively thin microscopic precipitate suspended in a macroscopic, glowing ‘fog’ of dense, brilliant radiation.”21

After perhaps 300,000 years, the average temperature of the universe fell to ca. 4,000°C above absolute zero, and this cooling made possible one of the most fundamental of all transitions in the history of the universe.22 Moments of transition are as mysterious as beginnings, and they will occur throughout our story. One of the most familiar examples in daily life is the transition that takes place when water turns into steam. Water is heated, and for a time all that seems to happen is that it gets warmer. Change occurs gradually, and we can watch it happening. Then, abruptly, a threshold is crossed; something new is created and the whole system enters a new phase. What had been liquid becomes gas. Why should a threshold occur at this particular point, in this case at 100°C (at sea level)? Sometimes we can explain transitions from one state to another, and the answer generally turns on a changing balance between different forces—between gravity, pressure, heat, electromagnetic forces, and so on. Sometimes we simply do not know why a threshold is crossed at a particular point.

The ending of the radiation era is a transition that physicists can more or less explain as a result of a balance between the falling energy of light photons as the universe expanded and the electromagnetic forces acting at the subatomic level. As the universe expanded, it cooled, and the energy of the light flowing through it fell sufficiently to enable positive protons to capture negative electrons and create stable, and thus electrically neutral, atoms. Because of that neutrality, atoms no longer interacted strongly with photons (though subtle interactions could still occur). As a result, photons of light could now flow freely through the universe. For most purposes, matter and energy ceased to interact. They became separate realms, like matter and spirit in the cosmologies of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic world. The era after this decoupling can be described as the “era of matter.”23

The first atoms were extremely simple. Most were hydrogen atoms, consisting of one proton and one electron. But there also appeared about one-third as many helium atoms, each with two protons and two electrons, as well as a trace of even larger atoms. All atoms are tiny, with diameters of roughly one-ten-millionth of a centimeter. But they consist mostly of empty space. The protons and neutrons huddle together in the nucleus, while the electrons orbit far away from them. As Richard Feynman puts it: “If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but almost all the weight of the atom is in that infinitesimal nucleus.”24 Three hundred thousand years after its creation, the universe was still simple. It consisted mostly of empty space, within which there drifted huge clouds of hydrogen and helium, and through which there poured an immense amount of energy.

Table 1.1 is a brief chronology of the early history of the universe. About 300,000 years after the big bang, all the ingredients of creation were present: time, space, energy, and the basic particles of the material universe, including protons, electrons, and neutrons, now mostly organized into atoms of hydrogen and helium. Since that time, nothing has really changed. The same energy and the same matter have continued to exist. All that has happened is that for the next 13 billion years these same ingredients have arranged themselves in different patterns, which constantly form and dissipate. From one perspective, the rest of the modern creation myth is merely the story of these different patterns.

But for us the patterns are all-important because we are pattern-detecting organisms. The patterns that emerged include the galaxies and stars, the chemical elements, the solar system, our earth, and all the living organisms that inhabit our earth. Finally, of course, they include ourselves. As an anonymous wit is supposed to have put it: “Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas which, given enough time, changes into people.”25 From this perspective, the modern creation myth is as paradoxical as any other early creation myth. Nothing changes; but everything changes. Though things seem to exist independently of each other, and to have particular and distinctive characteristics, it is also true that everything is really the same. The idea that form and matter are different expressions of the same underlying essence was proposed by the Italian Giordano Bruno as early as 1584, in a book called Concerning the Cause, Principle, and One. But the same idea occurs in much deep religious and philosophical thought. According to one of the holiest of Buddhist texts, the Heart Sutra, “Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness.”26 How patterns were created out of the apparent chaos of the early universe will be one of the central themes of the next chapter.

EVIDENCE FOR BIG BANG COSMOLOGY




From these metaphysical speculations, we must return to the prosaic but crucial issue of evidence. Why do modern astronomers accept what seems, at first sight, such a bizarre creation story? Why should we take this story seriously? The short answer is that for all its oddity, the modern story of creation is based on a colossal amount of hard evidence.





Hubble and the Redshift




The first crucial piece of evidence emerged from studies of the size and shape of the universe. Mapping the universe meant trying to determine the distance between the stars, the way in which stars were arranged, and how they moved relative to each other. Modern attempts to map the universe scientifically date to the late nineteenth century.

Finding the distance to stars is extremely difficult. With nearby stars, it is possible to estimate distances using elementary trigonometry and exact measurements of a star’s parallax. The largest baseline available to Earth bound astronomers is Earth’s orbit around the Sun, so astronomers look for stars whose positions appear to shift when observed at six-month intervals. But even this approach requires measurements that were too precise for any astronomers before the nineteenth century (see figure 1.1).

For more distant stars, we have to rely on methods that are even less precise. In the first decade of the twentieth century, an American astronomer, Henrietta Leavitt, studied variable stars—that is, stars whose brightness varies in a regular cycle. She discovered that in a particular type of variable star, the so-called Cepheid variables, the cycle reflected the size and the brightness of the stars. What made the Cepheids seem to grow by turns brighter and then darker was their expansion and contraction. Leavitt showed that the larger (and therefore brighter) Cepheids expand and contract more slowly. So, by measuring the length of the cycle, astronomers could estimate the size and therefore the real (or “intrinsic”) brightness of each Cepheid variable. Then, by measuring the brightness it appeared to have to an observer on the earth, they could estimate how much light had been lost in the journey to our earth, and therefore how far away the star really was.





Figure 1.1. Parallax: measuring the distance of stars using elementary trigonometry. In the course of six months, the earth changes its position in the sky as it orbits the Sun. As a result, the positions of nearby stars seem to shift slightly during the year; and the closer stars are, the greater their apparent change in position. (A shift in the apparent position of an object caused by movements of the observer is known as parallax.) By measuring these shifts carefully, you can use elementary trigonometry to determine a star’s real distance from the earth. This was the first way of determining the real scale of the cosmos. With more distant stars, the angles are too tiny for this method to work, so other methods have to be used.

In the 1920s, another American astronomer, Edwin Hubble, using the Mount Wilson telescope outside Los Angeles, relied on Cepheid variables as he tried to map large areas of the universe. He found, first, that many Cepheids apparently existed outside our galaxy, the Milky Way. This meant that the universe consisted not just of one galaxy but of many, thereby proving an idea that the German philosopher Immanuel Kant had proposed almost two centuries before. (Specifically, Kant suggested quite correctly that the objects astronomers call nebulae often consisted of separate galaxies, well beyond our own.) This idea, which Hubble announced in 1924, already marked a revolution in modern astronomy. Within a few years, Hubble’s work led him to an insight that was even more revolutionary, and much more profound. In the late 1920s, he found that most distant galaxies seemed to be moving away from us. Indeed, the farther away they were, the faster they seemed to be moving away from our galaxy. We now know that the most distant observable galaxies are moving away from us at more than 90 percent of the speed of light. How could Hubble know this? And what did this strange observation mean?

Oddly, it is easier to measure whether distant objects are moving toward or away from us than to determine their exact distance from us. The techniques involved are elegant, and not too difficult to grasp. If we take the light from a distant star and pass it through a spectrometer, we can analyze the various parts of the light spectrum. This is like watching sunlight through a prism. Different frequencies are bent by different angles as they pass through a prism; thus, as they leave the prism, they are displayed in bands of different colors like a rainbow. Each band, or color, represents light of a certain energy or frequency; and once they are split up in this way, each energy level can be studied separately. In star spectra, including that of our sun, narrow dark lines appear at particular frequencies. Studies in laboratories have shown that these lines occur because as light travels toward us, it passes through materials that absorb energy at particular frequencies, ensuring that those frequencies reach us in a weakened form. These darker lines are known as absorption lines. Each absorption line corresponds to a particular element, which absorbs light energy at specific frequencies. Remarkably, this means that by studying the absorption lines in starlight, we can estimate what elements are present in stars and in what quantities. Indeed, modern knowledge of how stars work (see chapter 2) is based largely on such studies.

Even more remarkably, star spectra can tell us whether a star is moving toward or away from us, and at what speed. The principle here is that of the Doppler effect—the phenomenon that makes an ambulance siren seem to drop in pitch as it passes by us. If a moving object (such as an ambulance) emits energy in waves (such as sound waves), those waves appear to be squashed up if the object is moving toward us, and stretched out if it is moving away from us. On a beach, if you walk into the surf, the wave crests will seem to strike your legs more frequently than if you stand still. But if you walk toward the beach, the crests will strike your legs less frequently. The same principle applies to light spectra. In the light from stars, absorption lines often seem to be shifted slightly from the position you would expect in a laboratory. Thus, the absorption line that represents hydrogen might be shifted to a higher frequency, making its light waves appear to be squashed up (or closer to the blue end of the spectrum). Or it might be shifted to a lower frequency (closer to the red end of the spectrum), in which case its light waves would appear to be stretched out. Hubble found both types of shift. But as he worked on the remotest objects, he realized that these were all shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. In other words, they appeared to be stretched out as if they were moving away from us. And the farther away they were, the greater the extent of the redshift.

The implications of Hubble’s discovery are spectacular but simple to comprehend. The farther a galaxy is from the earth, the faster it is moving away from us, although stars in our own galaxy and some neighboring galaxies are held together by gravity. We have no reason to think that we live in an abnormal part of the universe. Indeed, modern maps of the distribution of galaxies suggest that the universe really is pretty homogenous on the largest scales. So we have to assume that other observers in any other part of the universe would also observe that other parts of the universe seemed to be moving away from them. And this must mean that the universe as a whole is expanding. If the universe is expanding, then in the past it must have been much smaller than it is now. If we follow this logic back in time, we will soon see that at some point in the distant past, the universe must have been infinitesimally small. This argument leads directly to the basic conclusion of modern big bang cosmology: the universe was once infinitesimally small, but it then expanded, and it continues expanding to the present day. Hubble’s work provided the first and still the most basic evidence for big bang cosmology.

Hubble also showed that by measuring the rate of expansion, scientists should be able to estimate how long the universe has been expanding. This was an astonishing conclusion, for it seemed to imply something totally unexpected. Hubble had found a way of measuring the age of the universe! Originally, he calculated that the rate of expansion (or the Hubble constant) was ca. 500 kilometers per second for every megaparsec of distance between two objects. (A megaparsec is the distance traveled by light in 3.26 million years, which is ca. 30.9 × 1018 km, or ca. 30 billion billion km.) This figure meant that the universe could only be about two billion years old. We now know that this is an impossible date, as the earth itself is at least twice this age. Modern estimates of the Hubble constant are lower, and imply an older universe. But determining exactly how old remains tricky, mainly because of the difficulty of calculating the real distance to remote galaxies. Modern attempts, which use several other types of distance markers in addition to Cepheid variables, suggest that the Hubble constant lies between 55 and 75 km per second per megaparsec. These figures imply that the universe is between 10 and 16 billion years old, and the most recent estimates seem to be converging on a figure of about 13 billion (13,000,000,000) years.27 For simplicity’s sake, that is the date used throughout this book.





Relativity and Nuclear Physics




In the early twentieth century, most astronomers still assumed that the universe was infinite, homogenous, and stable. Hubble’s conclusions would have seemed very odd if it had not been for some other developments that were undermining the traditional picture. One was the publication of Einstein’s theory of relativity. The details of his theory are not important here, but one implication is that at the largest scales, the universe was probably unstable. Einstein’s equations suggested that the universe, like a pin standing on its end, had to fall to one side or the other. It had to be either expanding or contracting; a perfectly balanced universe was very unlikely. Einstein himself resisted this conclusion. Indeed, in what he later described as the greatest error of his life, he altered his theory by proposing the existence of a force he called the “cosmological constant,” in order to preserve the idea of a stable universe. This force he imagined as a sort of antigravity, which could counterbalance gravity and thus prevent the universe from collapsing in on itself. However, in 1922 a Russian, Alexander Friedmann, showed that the universe really might be either expanding or contracting. Eventually, even Einstein accepted the idea of an unstable and evolving universe.

But it took time to work out the ramifications of these discoveries. In the 1940s, the idea of an expanding universe still seemed odd to most astronomers. Then, between the 1940s and the 1960s, new evidence accumulated in support of the idea until, by the late 1960s, the big bang theory had become the standard account of the origins of the universe. In the late 1940s, using some of the knowledge gained from work on the atomic bomb, a number of physicists in the United States—including the Russian American physicist George Gamow—began to work their way through the implications of this new view of the universe. What would a tiny universe look like? It was clear that it would have been extremely hot: just as a bicycle tire becomes hotter when more air is pumped in, so the universe must have been extremely hot when all its matter and energy was squashed into a tiny space. The details of how matter would behave under such conditions do not concern us here. What matters is that scientists such as Gamow and later Fred Hoyle (who was to become a fierce critic of big bang cosmology) soon realized that it was possible, using existing ideas about how energy and matter worked at different temperatures, to start doing some calculations about the behavior of the early universe. And the answers made sense. They found they could construct a surprisingly plausible picture of how the early universe was constructed under the assumptions of the big bang theory. In particular, it was possible, roughly, to work out what forms of energy and matter would have existed in the early universe, and determine how that universe would have changed as it expanded and cooled. It soon became apparent that the idea of an early, dense, and hot universe was perfectly consistent with all that was known in the emerging field of particle physics.





Cosmic Background Radiation




What finally persuaded most astronomers to accept the big bang theory was the discovery of cosmic background radiation, or CBR. Early theories of how a big bang might have worked suggested that as temperatures fell during the early history of the universe, distinct particles and forces would acquire a stable existence as soon as temperatures were low enough for them to survive. As we have seen, for several hundred thousand years the early universe was too energetic and too hot for atoms to form. But eventually temperatures fell low enough for protons (with their positive electrical charges) to capture electrons (which have a negative charge). At this point, matter became electrically neutral, and energy and light could flow freely through the universe. Some of the earliest theorists of big bang cosmology predicted that there ought at that moment to have been a huge release of energy, whose remnants might be detectable today.

It is a sign of the caution with which scientists still approached the idea of a big bang that no one actually looked for this background energy. It was found accidentally, in 1964, by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, two scientists working for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. They were trying to build extremely sensitive radio antennae, but found it was impossible to eliminate all the background “noise” they picked up. Eventually, they realized that wherever they pointed their antennae, there was always a faint hum of weak energy. What could possibly be emitting energy from all directions of the sky at the same time? Energy coming from a particular star or galaxy made sense, but energy coming from everywhere—and so much energy—seemed to make no sense at all. Though the signal was weak, the total when all the energy it represented was added up was colossal. They mentioned their discovery to a radio astronomer who had heard a talk by a cosmologist, P. J. E. Peebles, predicting the existence of remnant radiation at an energy level equivalent to a temperature of ca. 3°C above absolute zero. This was remarkably close to the temperature of the radiation found by Penzias and Wilson. They had found the flash of energy predicted by early theorists of the big bang.

Their discovery was decisive because no other theory could explain such a universal and powerful source of energy, while big bang cosmology could explain it naturally and easily Since 1965, few astronomers have doubted that the big bang theory is the best current explanation for the origins of the universe. It is now the central idea of modern astronomy, the paradigm that unifies the theories and ideas of modern astronomy. And the cosmic background radiation is central to modern cosmology: attempts to map tiny variations in it should provide us in the near future with the best information available on the nature of the early universe. (One cosmologist, Dr. Max Tegmark, has even suggested that “the Cosmic microwave background is to cosmology what DNA is to biology.”)28 A new satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, or WMAP, which was launched in June 2001, is designed to describe these tiny variations more precisely than ever before.29





Other Forms of Evidence




More evidence for the big bang has accumulated since the discovery of the CBR. For example, the big bang theory predicts that the early universe will consist mainly of simple elements, above all hydrogen (ca. 76 percent) and smaller amounts of helium (ca. 24 percent). These are about the ratios we observe in the universe today (though the amount of hydrogen has fallen to ca. 71 percent as reactions within stars have converted hydrogen into helium, which now accounts for ca. 28 percent of all matter). The chemical dominance of hydrogen and helium is not immediately obvious to us, because we live in a corner of the universe that happens to have high concentrations of other elements (see chapters 2 and 3), but the evidence is all around us nonetheless. Hydrogen is by far the most common element, even in our own bodies. As Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan write: “Our bodies of hydrogen mirror a universe of hydrogen.”30 Especially precise measurements have also been made of the tiny amounts of lithium created in the big bang. These, too, are remarkably close to the figure predicted by theories of element formation during the big bang.

Then there is the fact that neither astronomical observations nor radiometric dating techniques (see appendix 1) can identify any objects that are much more than 12 billion years old. If the universe had in fact existed for much longer than this (perhaps for several hundred billion years), the absence of any objects older than a cutoff date of 12 billion years would be extremely surprising.

Finally, the big bang theory—unlike its main rival, the steady state theory—implies that the universe has changed over time. This means that the most distant parts of the universe ought to seem different from those closer to us; for in looking at objects, say, 10 billion light-years away, we are in effect looking at the universe as it was 10 billion years ago. And, as we will see, distant objects are different from the modern universe in important ways. For example, the early universe contained many more quasars (see chapter 2) than does the modern universe.





How Trustworthy Is Big Bang Cosmology?




Is big bang cosmology true? No scientific theory can claim absolutely certainty. And there remain problems with the theory, some of which are highly technical. But at present, none of these problems seems insurmountable.

For a time in the early 1990s, it appeared that some stars were older than the apparent age of the universe—evidence, according to some astronomers, that cast serious doubt on the entire theory. Observations using the Hubble telescope have since shown that this is not true. The oldest stars now seem to be about one billion years younger than the date of the universe as determined by the latest estimates of the Hubble constant. This is good news for big bang cosmology! But there was less welcome news when, in the late 1990s, evidence began to accumulate from studies of distant Ia type supernovae (see chapter 2) that the rate of expansion of the universe, rather than decreasing under the influence of gravity, is in fact increasing. If these observations are correct, they are startling, for they seem to imply that there exists some hitherto unknown force that has operated constantly since the big bang to maintain and accelerate the rate of expansion, but that is too weak to have been detected before. One possibility is that this force consists of “vacuum energy,” a force predicted by quantum mechanics that would act in a way opposite to gravity, driving matter and energy apart rather than drawing them together. If so, its effects may be almost identical to those of Einstein’s speculative cosmological constant.31 This evidence may throw a largish wrench into the machinery of big bang cosmology. On the other hand, it may provide an unexpected solution to the problem of dark matter (see chapter 2), because vacuum energy, like all energy, has mass, which may account for a substantial amount of the matter that astronomers have been looking for. There is also the tricky problem of beginnings. At the beginning of the big bang, all our scientific knowledge seems to go haywire. The density of the universe seems to move toward infinity, as does its temperature, and modern science has no good way of dealing with such phenomena, though it has many promising ideas.

What encourages us to take the theory seriously despite these difficulties is its consistency with most of the empirical and theoretical knowledge assembled by modern astronomy and modern particle physics. And no other theory of origins can explain so much. That scientists have constructed a logical theory consistent with so much evidence, and one that seems to tell us what happened during the first few minutes of our universe’s history, is itself an astonishing achievement. It is no less remarkable when we realize that future research is likely to modify the current theory, perhaps in quite significant ways.





NOTE ON EXPONENTIAL NOTATION




Modern science often deals with large quantities and large numbers. Writing out, say, a billion billion billion would take a lot of space (to see how much, look at the second paragraph of this note), so scientists use what they call exponential notation; a number of figures in this chapter use this convenient mathematical shorthand. Here is how it works.32 One hundred is 10 multiplied by 10, or two 10s multiplied together. In exponential notation, 100 can be written as 102. One thousand is three 10s multiplied together, or 103, and so on. To convert a number in exponential notation to one in normal notation, write down a 1, then add the number of zeros that appear in the exponent. One thousand (103), therefore, is 1 with three zeros after it; one billion is 109, or 1 with 9 zeros after it—that is, 1,000,000,000. We can use the same notation for small numbers, too. One hundredth ( or 1 percent) is written as 10−2; and one thousandth () is written as 10−3. The system also works well for numbers that are not an exact multiple of ten. Thus 13 billion years can be thought of as 13 times a billion years. In exponential notation this becomes 13 × 109 years.

The crucial thing to note is that increasing the exponent by one multiplies the size of the previous number ten times. So 103 is not just slightly bigger than 102; it is, in fact ten times as large. In the same way, 1018 (or a billion billion) is not double the size of 109; it is one billion times (109times) as large; and it is ten times as large as 1017. Exponential notation provides a deceptively simple way of describing colossal numbers, which can easily lull us into forgetting how large these numbers really are. The mass of a hydrogen atom can be written in exponential notation as 1.7 × 10−27 kilograms. In ordinary script, this is a simple, but lengthy, fraction: 1.7/1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms, or 1.7 times one billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a kilogram. To understand what this really means is trickier. Try to imagine something so small that it weighs just one-billionth of a kilogram. (We cannot do it, of course—our minds are not designed to deal with such calculations; but we can make the effort.) Then try to imagine something that weighs one billionth of this; then repeat the experiment a third time, and you are imagining the size of a hydrogen atom. To weigh the Sun, you multiply instead of dividing. The Sun has a mass of about 2 × 1027 tons, or 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons, which is two times a billion billion billion tons. It contains about 1.2 × 1057 atoms. The universe contains about 1022 stars. To roughly estimate the number of atoms in the universe, we can multiply these two numbers together, which means adding the two exponents, to get 1.2 × 1079 atoms. This may not seem so impressive until we start writing the number out in ordinary notation, and even then, most of us cannot really understand what we are writing down. In the final chapter of this book, we will come across numbers much, much larger than even these huge figures.





SUMMARY




Before about 13 billion years ago, we can say nothing with any confidence about the universe. We do not even know if space and time existed. At some point, energy and matter exploded out of the emptiness, creating both time and space. The early universe was fantastically hot and extremely dense, and it expanded extraordinarily fast in a sort of cosmic explosion. As it expanded, it cooled. Matter and antimatter annihilated each other, leaving a tiny residue of matter. Out of the violent flux of the early universe, there appeared distinct entities—protons, neutrons, photons of light, electrons—and distinct forces, including the strong force, the weak force, and the forces of gravity and electromagnetism. After a few hundred thousand years, the universe was cool enough for protons and electrons to form stable atoms, and the matter in the universe became electrically neutral. As a result, matter and energy ceased to interact constantly, and radiation began to flow freely through the universe. As the universe expanded, the temperature of the radiation fell; it is now detectable as the cosmic background radiation.

This story, as strange as it may seem, is based on a colossal amount of scientific research, and it is compatible with most of what we know today about astronomy and particle physics. Big bang cosmology is now the central idea of modern cosmology. It is the paradigm that unites modern ideas on the nature and history of the universe, and it dominates the first chapter of the modern creation myth.





FURTHER READING




Barbara Sproul’s Primal Myths (1991) is a collection of creation myths from many different cultures, accompanied by an introductory essay. There are now many popular accounts of big bang cosmology, some by authors who helped construct the modern story of the origins of the universe. The following are some of the books I have found most helpful. Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time (1988) is one of the best known, and has recently been followed by his The Universe in a Nutshell (2001); even more technical is Steven Weinberg, The First Three Minutes (2nd ed., 1993). John Gribbin’s Genesis (1981) is a superb introduction for the general reader (and one of the inspirations for this book), though it’s beginning to show its age. More up-to-date, though equally readable, are Timothy Ferris, The Whole Shebang (1997); John Barrow, The Origin of the Universe (1994); Peter Coles, Cosmology (2001); and Armand Delsemme, Our Cosmic Origins (1998). Delsemme’s book is relevant for much of the first half of this book. Cesare Emiliani’s Scientific Companion (1995) is a useful handbook for those who want more precise information about the ideas and terminology of modern astronomy, chemistry, and physics. Eric Chaisson’s Cosmic Evolution (2001) is an attempt to think through the meaning of order and entropy at many different scales, from stars to microbes, and Martin Rees’s Just Six Numbers (2000) is also about the fundamental structures of the universe. Lee Smolin’s Life of the Cosmos (1998) is a readable book that consists of grand speculations about the possibility that our universe is one of a vast population of universes that change according to some form of cosmic evolution. Charles Lineweaver’s short essay “Our Place in the Universe” (2002) is a marvelous introduction to the challenge of thinking about scale and orientation within the universe. Nigel Calder’s Timescale (1983) is a remarkable chronology for the whole of time, though it is now old enough to be slightly dated.
