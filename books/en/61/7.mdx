APPENDIX 1


DATING TECHNIQUES, CHRONOLOGIES, AND TIMELINES




At the core of the modern creation myth, as in any story, there is a timeline. How was the modern timeline constructed? And how can we begin to understand its many different scales?





CONSTRUCTING A MODERN TIMELINE




One of the most astonishing features of the modern creation story is that it confidently describes events that happened billions of years before humans existed. Many of these chronological details have come into focus only in the past few decades, so the timeline behind the story told in this book is, in many parts, very recent. How was it constructed?

Where written records exist, dating is not a great problem, and modern historians have relied mainly on written records to construct their accounts of the past. But things are different when we deal with larger time spans not covered by written records. Even fifty years ago, attempts to construct such timelines would have been vastly more difficult than they are today. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it seemed that precise knowledge of the distant past was impossible. We might be able to determine the relative order of events (such as the sequence in which particular rocks had been laid down), but there seemed no way of determining absolute dates.

In the Christian world, the Bible was regarded as a primary source for ancient dates until as late as the nineteenth century. Estimates for the moment of creation were established by adding up the dates of all the generations listed in the Bible. Such calculations suggested that God had made the Earth about 6,000 years ago. In the seventeenth century, as noted in chapter 1, one British scholar concluded that humans had been created at 9:00 AM on 23 October 4004 BCE. But even in the seventeenth century, some scholars with an interest in geology realized that the earth had to be older than that. For example, they became aware that fossil objects found high in mountain regions seemed to be the remains of ancient fish, which suggested that the mountains they were in must have risen up from sea level. Such changes, the scholars thought, must have taken longer than 6,000 years. By the nineteenth century, geologists were getting used to the idea of much larger timescales, and they were growing very skilled at identifying relative dates. They could tell which layer of rock had been laid down first, knowledge that in turn enabled them to put fossils in sequence to describe the rough stages of evolutionary history. But there seemed to be no precise way of determining absolute dates. One influential attempt to fix the age of the earth was that of William Thompson (Lord Kelvin). He argued in the 1860s that the earth had existed for less than 100 million years, and perhaps as little as 20 million years, based on his assumption that the earth and Sun had once been molten balls of matter that had cooled to their present temperatures. To estimate their age, Lord Kelvin calculated how long this cooling would have taken. He was wrong, because he did not understand the role of radioactivity, which maintained the internal heat of both bodies (though in different ways). Indeed, it was an understanding of radioactivity that eventually made it possible to determine precise absolute dates for the modern creation story.1

Radiometric dating techniques exploit a feature of all radioactive materials, including many isotopes of normally stable chemicals, such as carbon.2 Many radioactive elements contain large numbers of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of their atoms. Because protons have a positive charge, they repel each other electrically; the more of them there are crammed into a single nucleus, the greater the repulsive force. Eventually, these repulsive forces can weaken the strong nuclear forces that hold nuclei together; for this reason, large nuclei tend to be more fragile than small nuclei. But even smaller nuclei can be unstable in certain configurations. Periodically, the nuclei of radioactive elements just start falling apart. They eject small numbers of protons and neutrons, and sometimes a single electron or positron; in so doing, they turn into different elements. This process, known as radioactive decay, continues until the original material has been transmuted, step by radioactive step, into a stable element, such as lead. Such decay occurs with great statistical regularity; though we can never predict when a particular nucleus will break down (just as we can never predict the outcome of a particular coin toss), we can be very precise about the behavior of large numbers of radioactive events. Thus we can estimate how rapidly large amounts of material will decay. This rate is normally calculated in half-lives. For example, the half-life of uranium 238 (the most common isotope of uranium) is ca. 4.5 billion years, or slightly less than the age of the earth. This means that if we start with a newly formed lump of uranium 238 (created, perhaps, in a supernova), after 4.5 billion years about half of it will have broken down into other elements. (The fact that so much of the uranium on Earth appears to be about 4.56 billion years old is one reason for thinking that a supernova exploded in our part of the galaxy just before our solar system formed.) The half-lives of radioactive elements vary greatly. For example, the half-life of carbon 14 (a rare isotope of carbon) is 5,715 years, which is why archaeologists use it to date events that occurred up to ca. 40,000 years ago.3 For earlier dates, too little of the original carbon 14 is left for accurate analysis, leading to anomalous results; so other methods have to be used.

The statistical regularity of radioactive decay enables us to calculate when a particular lump of matter containing radioactive material was formed. By using such techniques, we can say, for example, that the earth was formed 4.56 billion years ago, or that the Cambrian era lasted from about 570 to 510 million years ago. The technical details are complex, but the general principle is simple enough. If you take a lump of radioactive material, you can measure what proportion of it has broken down into other elements, and from that figure you can calculate how long the lump has existed. There is always a certain amount of unreliability in these calculations, but even the degree of reliability can be estimated with some precision. The principles of radiometric dating were first developed in the United States by Willard Libby, in the 1950s. Since that time, the techniques have been improved greatly. As a result, since the mid-twentieth century, archaeologists, geologists, paleontologists, and astronomers have been able to calculate precise absolute dates for many major events in the remote past of our planet and solar system. Radiometric dating techniques provide many of the more important dates for the modern timeline.

Molecular dating is a more recent technique, developed first in the 1980s; it is used mainly to determine the evolutionary distance between two related species (see chapter 6). It works by comparing similar genetic material (such as DNA) from two organisms and then estimating the difference between the two samples. The calculation of many estimates of this kind has shown that much genetic change is statistically random; thus, like the breakdown of radioactive materials, it can function as a sort of clock. Scientists first used molecular clocks to determine when the human and ape lines diverged, and they came up with the scandalously short result of ca. 5 to 7 million years ago. The rapid acceptance of this date by paleontologists greatly enhanced the credibility of the technique, which is now used to date many other important processes, such as the date of human migrations to different parts of the world.

The big bang poses its own chronological problems. Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding, and he also showed that it was possible, in principle, to calculate the rate of expansion. To undertake this calculation, he first had to determine the distance between galaxies and the rate at which they were moving apart. Neither task is easy, and the problem is further complicated because the rate of expansion has probably changed over time, influenced by gravity or perhaps (as recent studies suggest) by some form of “vacuum energy.” Hubble’s first attempt to calculate the rate of expansion (the Hubble constant) suggested that the universe was only 2 billion years old—clearly an impossible figure, as Earth itself was thought to be at least 4.5 billion years old. Modern estimates put the origin of the universe at about 13 billion years ago. This date is (just) consistent with dates for the oldest known stars (about 12 billion years old), and with the absence of any older radiometric dates. The most recent studies, based on evidence released in 2003 using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), give the extraordinarily precise date of 13.7 billion years ago for the big bang. The same studies suggest that the first stars lit up a mere 200 million years later, so it is no surprise that the estimated ages of the oldest stars have sometimes seemed dangerously close to estimates for the age of the universe itself.





UNDERSTANDING LARGE TIMESCALES




Grasping the scales of the modern creation myth is extremely difficult for those not used to dealing with large timescales. But this is not a problem unique to the modern creation story. Some Hindu and Buddhist chronologies of the universe’s history are even more extravagant than those of modern science.



Suppose, O Monks—the Buddha once told his followers—there was a huge rock of one solid mass, one mile long, one mile wide, one mile high, without split or flaw. And at the end of every hundred years a man should come and rub against it once with a silken cloth. Then that huge rock would wear off and disappear quicker than a world-period [kalpa]. But of such world-periods, O Monks, many have passed away, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundred thousands.4





To really grasp the scale of the modern creation myth, we need to make a similar imaginative effort. This appendix includes several timelines that may help the reader become more familiar with the different timescales of the modern creation story.

The earliest parts of the book figure dates in relation to the present. Thus, the universe was probably created about 13 billion years ago, and the earth about 4.6 billion years ago, while the earliest evidence for multicellular organisms appears about 600 million years ago, and the earliest skeletal evidence for the existence of hominines (the bipedal primates from which modern humans are descended) appears about 4 million years ago (though recent finds are pushing these dates back to about 6 million years). As we approach the era of human history, we use this system more formally, adopting the archaeologists’ terminology of dates BP (before the present). Strictly speaking, such dates, if based on radiometric dating techniques, are calculated “before 1950.” For all dates after ca. 5,000 years ago (from chapter 9 on, generally speaking), I use the more familiar system of BCE (before the common era) and CE (common era), which are equivalent to the traditional Christian dating system of BC and AD. To translate from dates BP into dates BCE, simply subtract 2,000 years. Thus, 5000 BP is equivalent to 3000 BCE.

What follows is a brief summary of the modern story of creation, and three different chronologies that may help the reader keep track of the book’s vast chronological scale. Scattered through the book are eight timelines at different scales, which may also help familiarize the reader with the multiple timescales of this story.





The Core Story




What follows is just one possible attempt to summarize the story told in the rest of this book.

Thirteen billion (13,000,000,000) years ago there was nothing. There wasn’t even emptiness. Time did not exist, nor did space. In this nothing, there occurred an explosion, and within a split second, something did exist. The early universe was fantastically hot—a searing cloud of energy and matter, much hotter than the interior of a sun. For a trillionth of a second it expanded faster than the speed of light, growing from the size of an atom to the size of a galaxy. Then the rate of expansion slowed, but the universe has continued expanding to the present day. As the early universe expanded, its temperature dropped. After about 300,000 years, it was cool enough for atoms of hydrogen and helium to form. Within about a billion years, huge clouds of hydrogen and helium began to gather and then collapse in on themselves under the pressure of gravity. As the center of these clouds heated up, atoms fused together violently like vast hydrogen bombs, and the first stars lit up. Hundreds of billions of stars appeared, gathered in the huge communities we call galaxies. The early universe consisted of little more than hydrogen and helium, but inside stars, and in the violent death agonies of large stars, new elements were created. And over time, more complex elements began to appear in interstellar space. Our own sun was formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and matter that contained many of these new elements, in addition to hydrogen and helium. The planets of our solar system were formed at the same time as the Sun, from the debris left over from the Sun’s creation.

The early earth was a dangerous place, bombarded by meteorites and so hot that much of it was molten. Over a billion years, however, it began to cool, and as it did so, water rained down on its surface to create the first seas. By 3.5 billion years ago, complex chemical reactions, probably taking place around deep-sea volcanoes, had created simple forms of life. Over the next 3.5 billion years, these simple, single-cell organisms became more and more diverse, evolving through natural selection. Quite early, some learned to extract energy from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. As other organisms began to feed on the photosynthesizers, sunlight became the main “battery” of life on earth. Powered by the Sun, living organisms spread through the seas and eventually over the land, creating an interconnected web of life that had a profound impact on the atmosphere, the land, and the sea. From about 600 million years ago, there began to appear larger organisms, each made up of billions of individual cells. A mere 250,000 years ago, our own species appeared, having evolved from apelike ancestors through the same unpredictable processes of natural selection.

Though they evolved in the same way as other animals, humans turned out to be unusually good at extracting resources from the environment. Their advantage lay in their ability to share information and ideas with a precision that no other animal could match. And over time, their shared knowledge accumulated, enabling each generation to build on the knowledge of earlier generations. The number of humans grew as they learned how to live in more and more diverse environments, first in Africa; then in Eurasia, Australia, and the Americas; and eventually in the myriad islands of the Pacific. These global migrations took many tens of thousands of years. Eventually, beginning a mere ten thousand years ago, humans in some parts of the world began to manipulate their environments so successfully that they could produce ever greater amounts of food from a given area of land. Using the technologies we refer to as agriculture, they began to settle down in small village communities. As populations grew, the number and size of villages also grew until the first large cities appeared, about 5,000 years ago. These large, dense settlements required new and complex forms of regulation to prevent disputes and coordinate the activities of many people living at close quarters. In this way there appeared the first states, groups of powerful individuals capable of regulating the activities of the community as a whole. Conflict appeared both within and between communities, as different groups competed for resources and power. But as communities also exchanged information, the technological resources available to humanity as a whole continued to accumulate. Over several thousand years, the size, the reach, and the populations of societies with states expanded, until eventually most humans were living within state-based societies with cities and some form of agriculture. As their numbers and technological skills grew, so did their impact on the biosphere—the community of other organisms on earth. In some regions, the impact of human activities such as irrigation or deforestation proved so damaging that the local environment could no longer support large human populations, and entire civilizations collapsed.

As technologies of communication and transportation improved, more and more communities came into contact with each other. About 500 years ago, for the first time, these changes connected human communities in all parts of the world. For many communities this coming together was disastrous; it brought conquest, disease, and exploitation, sometimes of the most brutal kind. But the merging of regional communities also helped trigger new technological breakthroughs that could now be shared throughout the world. In the past two centuries, new technologies, beginning with the harnessing of steam power, have given human societies access to the vast sources of energy locked up in fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Human populations have grown more rapidly than ever before, and the problems of administering these huge communities, and coping with conflicts between them, have demanded the creation of even more powerful and complex state systems. Today, human numbers are so great, and the impact of humans on the biosphere is so significant, that we are in real danger of doing serious damage to the environment that is our home. Such damage could lead to a global collapse of human civilizations and have devastating effects on other organisms as well. At the same time, the ability of humans to share knowledge is now greater than ever before, and it may be that new technologies and new ways of organizing human societies will enable us to avoid the dangers created by our ecological virtuosity.





A Chronology for the Whole of Time




The first chronology gives a list of (approximate) dates. These cover some of the fundamental changes and transitions dealt with in the text.

History of the Universe before Our Sun (from 13 Billion Years to 4.5 Billion Years Ago)

• ca. 13,000,000,000 (13 billion) years ago: The big bang, the origin of the universe; the universe expands to the size of a galaxy; many vital events occur during the next few seconds; protons and electrons appear in the first second.



• ca. 300,000 years later: The universe has cooled to about a few thousand degrees Celsius, and electrons are captured by protons to form the first (electrically neutral) atoms, of hydrogen and helium; cosmic background radiation (CBR) is released as the universe becomes electrically neutral (the detection of CBR in 1964 led to general acceptance of the big bang theory of the origins of the universe).



• ca. 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) years after the big bang: The first stars light up as hydrogen atoms begin to fuse into helium atoms at the center of huge clouds of gas, under the pressure of gravity; billions of stars cluster into galaxies; new elements form in the interior of stars (all elements up to iron, with 26 protons) or in the vast explosions of dying stars known as supernovae (elements up to uranium, with 92 protons).



• ca. 4,600,000,000 (4.6 billion) years ago: The Sun, Earth, and solar system form from clouds of stardust containing the debris of older stars.



History of Earth and Life on Earth (from 4.5 Billion Years Ago)

• ca. 3,500,000,000 (3.5 billion) years ago: The first living organisms on earth appear; DNA is the basis of reproduction, and still present in every cell of every living thing (it reproduces by making almost perfect copies of itself; change and evolution are possible because the copies are not absolutely perfect, and when imperfect copies manage to survive, their descendants eventually form new species); early life consists of prokaryotes, little more than strands of DNA floating inside a protective container, or cell; photosynthesizing cells use the energy of sunlight and produce oxygen.



• ca. 2,500,000,000 (2.5 billion) years ago: Free oxygen, produced by photosynthesizing organisms, begins to change the earth’s atmosphere.



• ca. 1,500,000,000 (1.5 billion) years ago: The first complex cells or eukaryotes appear, which have nuclei containing DNA and complex internal organelles (all complex life-forms evolve from eukaryotes); groups of cells start clustering together into large colonies to form the first multicelled creatures; with sexual reproduction, in which two not quite identical organisms swap their DNA to form a new creature, different from either parent, the pace of change accelerates.



• ca. 600,000,000 (600 million) years ago: The first fossils of larger, multicellular creatures appear during the Cambrian era; formation of an ozone layer, from oxygen high up in the atmosphere, makes it easier for life to evolve on land, as it shields the surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the Sun, but not from its warmth and light; life spreads to the land and air, as well as multiplying and diversifying within the seas.



• ca. 65,000,000 (65 million) years ago: The extinction of the dinosaurs occurs, probably as the result of an asteroid impact, whose effects were similar to those of a nuclear war; mammals begin to replace dinosaurs as dominant large land animals; the first primates appear, tree-dwelling mammals with larger brains, dexterous hands, and stereoscopic vision.



The Paleolithic Era of Human History (from ca. 7 million to ca. 10,000 Years Ago)

• ca. 7,000,000 (7 million) years ago: The first hominines evolve from apes, distinguished by bipedalism.



• ca. 4,000,000 (4 million) years ago: Australopithecines emerge.



• ca. 2–1.5 million years ago: Homo habilis, the first member of our genus, appears.



• ca. 1.8 million years ago: Homo ergaster/erectus develops.



• ca. 1 million years ago: Members of the species Homo erectus migrate to southern parts of Eurasia.



• ca. 250,000 years ago: The appearance of the first modern humans, probably with fully developed language: Homo sapiens.



• ca. 100,000 years ago: Modern humans move into the Near East, where they probably encounter Neanderthals.



• ca. 60,000 years ago: The first colonization of Sahul/Australia by modern humans.



• ca. 25,000 years ago: Modern humans move into Siberia; Neanderthals, the only remaining nonhuman hominines, become extinct.



• ca. 13,000 years ago: The first clear evidence of colonization of the Americas, across the Bering Straits.



The Holocene Era of Human History (the Past 10,000 Years)

• ca. 10,000–5,000 years ago: The last ice age ends; intensive foraging technologies, some sedentary societies appear, along with early forms of agriculture; populations begin to grow rapidly; there are early signs of complexity and hierarchy, as large communities require new, more complex forms of organization.



• ca. 5,000 years ago: The first cities, states, and agrarian civilizations emerge; powerful elites control resources through tribute-taking; these elites organize warfare, large-scale worship, and monument building; writing is invented; agrarian civilizations spread and become the most populous and powerful of human communities.



The Modern Era (the Past 500 Years-the Future)

• ca. 500 years ago: Afro-Eurasia and the Americas come together, forming the largest “world zones” on earth; the first global system of exchange is created.



• ca. 200 years ago: The first capitalist societies emerge in western Europe; the Industrial Revolution exploits fossil fuels; there is huge increase in the power, wealth, and influence of European states; European imperialism dominates the globe.



• ca. 100 years ago: The Industrial Revolution begins to spread more widely; conflict breaks out between leading capitalist states; a communist backlash occurs.



• ca. 50 years ago: The first use of a nuclear weapon takes place (humans learn to use the explosive power present at the origin of the universe, and are in danger of destroying themselves and the rest of the biosphere).



• ca. 4–5,000 million years into the future: The Sun begins to die.



• Many billions of years further into the future: The universe will decay into a state of featureless equilibrium.





Thirteen Billion Years in Thirteen Years




The second chronology also covers 13 billion years. However, it collapses the timescales of modern cosmology by a factor of one billion, reducing 13 billion years to 13 years. Doing this may make it easier to grasp the crucial differences between different types of timescale.

History of the Universe before Our Sun: From 13 to ca. 4.5 Years Ago

• The big bang occurs ca. 13 years ago.



• The first stars and galaxies appear by about 12 years ago.



• The Sun and solar system form about 4.5 years ago.



History of Earth and Life on Earth: From 4 Years to ca. 3 Weeks Ago

• The first living organisms appear about 4 years ago.



• The first multicelled organisms appear about 7 months ago.



• Pangaea forms about 3 months ago.



• Dinosaurs are driven to extinction after a meteor impact about 3 weeks ago; mammals flourish.



The Paleolithic Era of Human History: From 3 Days Ago to 6 Minutes Ago

• First hominines evolve in Africa about 3 days ago.



• First Homo sapiens evolve about 50 minutes ago in Africa.



• First humans reach Papua New Guinea/Australia about 26 minutes ago.



• First humans reach Americas about 6 minutes ago.



The Holocene Era of Human History: From 6 Minutes Ago to 15 Seconds Ago

• First agricultural communities flourish about 5 minutes ago.



• First literate urban civilizations appear about 3 minutes ago.



• Classical civilizations of China, Persia, India, and the Mediterranean and the first agrarian civilizations in Americas emerge about 1 minute ago.



• Mongol Empire briefly unites much of Eurasia about 24 seconds ago; Black Death.



The Modern Era: The Past 15 Seconds

• Human communities are linked into a single “world system” about 15 seconds ago.



• The Industrial Revolution occurs about 6 seconds ago.



• Industrial Revolution spreads to Europe about 6 seconds ago.



• The First World War is fought about 2 seconds ago.



• Human populations reach 5, then 6 billion; the first atomic weapons are used; humans walk on the Moon; and the electronic revolution occurs, all within the last second.



So, at the end of 13 years, the universe would have existed for 13 years, and the earth for fewer than 5. Complex, multicelled organisms would have existed for about 7 months, hominines for a mere 3 days, and our own species, Homo sapiens, for a mere 50 minutes. Agricultural societies would have existed for only 5 minutes, and the entire recorded history of civilization for 3 minutes. The modern industrial civilizations that dominate the world today would have existed for 6 seconds.





The Geological Timescale




The third chronology will be familiar to students of geology. It is the geological timescale. You will undoubtedly come across references to it, so it is worth getting used to its main features. Table A1 presents one, highly simplified version. Don’t worry too much if the dates seem to vary slightly from version to version; it’s the large picture that matters.

APPENDIX 2


CHAOS AND ORDER




In this appendix, I will argue that there are objects that recur at all the different scales discussed in this book. Though not essential to understanding the book’s argument, the appendix may clarify some details and may help the reader see more clearly some of the links between different parts of the modern creation story.

Of all the patterns that occur at many different scales, the most fundamental is the existence of pattern itself.1 Wherever we look, we see organized structures, or regimes. We don’t see unrelated bits and pieces, like a sort of cosmic static; patterns that are too simple and repetitive also tend to fade into the background. What we notice are complex patterns that combine structure and diversity. These are the patterns that stand out against a background of disorder or extreme simplicity, and that have histories. If there are general rules of historical change, they concern the ways in which these patterns are created and evolve.

We see complex structures in part because we are built to see complex structures. All living organisms have to map their environment in order to survive. They have to be able to detect seasonal changes, the movements of the Sun and Moon, the movements of prey and predators. Thus they have to be pattern detectors, tracking how the bits and pieces of their environment fall into larger and more predictable shapes. Humans, too, are constantly distinguishing between those parts of the environment that have structure and those that do not. We are necessarily more interested in the stars than in the vast reaches of near-empty space that lie between them. We have also learned how to track many patterns that are not immediately accessible to our senses, such as the patterns of deep time. Order and chaos shape all our attempts to understand our world.

But the patterns we detect are really there, and their existence is one of the great puzzles of the universe. Why is there order of any kind? And what rules allow the creation and evolution of ordered structures? Creating disorder seems to be much easier than creating order. Think of a pack of cards. Shuffled randomly, it will rarely produce an ordered sequence—say, an ordered run of thirteen hearts. And if it does, that sequence will vanish after a few more shuffles. But when we study the universe as a whole, we find complex and durable patterns at many different scales, from clusters of galaxies stretching over millions of light-years, to the complex social structures of human history, to the even more durable patterns that lock quarks into the subatomic particles we call protons and neutrons.

Many religions solve the problem of explaining these complex and durable patterns by claiming that complex entities such as ourselves were created by an intelligent creator or deity. For modern science this can be no solution, for it merely raises the further problem of how such a deity might have been created. Can we explain complexity without introducing a hypothesis that begs so many more questions? At present, no entirely satisfactory answers to these questions exist; the following paragraphs can merely hint at some modern approaches to a solution.

One thing is immediately clear: creating and maintaining patterns requires work. A pack of cards has many more disordered than ordered states, so most shuffles will yield a disordered state. The universe seems to work similarly, with a natural tendency toward disorder and chaos. Creating and sustaining patterns means working against this apparently universal tendency toward disorder; it means helping unlikely things to happen and keep happening.

Understanding patterns therefore means understanding how energy does work. In the nineteenth century, studies of the efficiency with which energy was used in steam engines led the French engineer Sadi Carnot to the conclusion that energy never vanishes; it simply changes the forms in which it exists. Thus as heat is used to generate steam, whose pressure can generate the mechanical energy of a steam engine, energy itself seems to be conserved. The law of the conservation of energy is often called the first law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics seems, at first sight, to contradict the first: it says that in a closed system (which the universe seems to be), the amount of free energy, or energy capable of doing work, tends to dissipate over time. A waterfall can drive a turbine because the water at its top has been lifted to higher levels, and the energy used to lift it (supplied by the Sun, which evaporated water vapor and lifted it into the clouds) is returned as water falls toward the sea. By the time the water has reached the sea, it can no longer do work, because all the water at sea level has about the same amount of available energy; it is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Usable or free energy, energy that can do work, requires a gradient, a slope, some form of difference. The second law predicts that over colossal periods of time, and in a closed system, all differentials will diminish; as they do so, there will be ever-diminishing amounts of free energy available to do the hard work of creating and sustaining complex entities. This seems to mean that the whole universe will eventually become less and less ordered as it tends toward a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In the nineteenth century, this depressing idea was described as the “heat death” of the universe. A German scientist, Rudolf Clausius, labeled the steadily increasing pile of unusable energy entropy. In the very long run, it seems, entropy must increase, and complexity must diminish.2 In the end, everything must become background noise. The second law apparently implies that everything in the universe is riding down the same escalator toward chaos.

These ideas are fundamental to modern physics, but they raise two deep problems. First, how is order possible at all? Why do we not find ourselves in a universe of total disorder, in which the second law has fulfilled its deadly mission? Did the universe start out with a stock of free energy on which all ordered entities have drawn ever since? If so, where did that energy capital come from and how long will it be before it runs out? Something (or someone?) must have done some heavy lifting in the early days of the universe to create the gradients and differences that create and sustain the patterns we see around us.3 If it was not a creator god who did this work, then how was it done? The ultimate source of free energy (and therefore of order) remains one of the great puzzles of modern cosmology, because, as far as we can tell, the early universe was remarkably homogenous.

That early universe was apparently dense and incredibly hot, in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. But as it expanded it cooled, and as it cooled, its symmetry was broken. The first differences appeared, and the first gradients of temperature and pressure. At first, there seemed little distinction between forces such as electricity and gravity. They all appeared to blend together in the violent energies of a universe that was nearly infinitely hot and infinitely dense. As it expanded and cooled, however, the different fundamental forces each assumed its own particular form. For example, before about 300,000 years after the big bang, the electromagnetic force was too weak to bind electrons and protons together into atoms. But after that time, the universe was cool enough for electricity to begin sculpting the atomic structures studied in modern physics and chemistry. At this point, matter and energy also became quite distinct.

As the universe expanded, tiny initial differences multiplied, and each of these forces began to operate in distinctive ways. Gravity operated at large scales, and shaped the large structures of the universe. Because matter was slow moving and heavy, it could be herded together by gravity more easily than energy, which was light and fast moving. So, as energy and matter separated, gravity got to work shaping matter into large, complex structures, while energy, for the most part, escaped its influence, except in extreme regions such as areas near black holes. First, gravity gathered hydrogen and helium into huge clouds. Then it began to squeeze each cloud into smaller and smaller spaces, until pressure and temperature built up, particularly at the center. When the cores reached about 10 million degrees, fusion reactions began, and stars lit up. The fusion reactions at the center of all stars counterbalanced the crushing force of gravity, negotiating a sort of cosmic truce that is the foundation of every star. Once created, stars provided stable, long-lived energy differentials, which offered durable stores of free energy, or negentropy. Stars created stable hot spots, dotted throughout the cooling early universe like raisins in a dough. Today, the cosmic background radiation is just a few degrees above absolute zero—this is the base temperature of the universe. But at their centers, stars must have enormously high temperatures for fusion to start—and in large stars, they can rise much higher than 10 million degrees. In the regions near these hot points, complex entities could begin to form, exploiting the huge temperature differentials between stars and surrounding space, just as early life on Earth formed around volcanic vents deep in the sea. As Paul Davies puts it: “Matter and energy in far-from-equilibrium open systems have a propensity to seek out higher and higher levels of organization and complexity.”4

On Earth, the temperature differential between our sun and surrounding space provides the free energy needed to create most forms of complexity, including ourselves; energies created early in the history of our solar system drive the internal heat battery of Earth, which drives plate tectonics. These differentials enable energy to flow, and energy flows make patterns possible. And given enough time, the mere possibility of pattern makes it likely that patterns of many different kinds will eventually appear.

According to this line of argument, the expansion of the universe, which allowed the early universe to cool and diversify, is the ultimate source of all temperature and pressure differentials, and therefore of the free energy needed to create order. We can put this argument slightly differently. At its moment of origin, the universe was so small and so homogenous that there were few possible disordered states; it was like a pack of cards with just one card. Expansion created a larger space and new possibilities for disorder, and these possibilities multiplied as the universe kept expanding. As a general rule, the larger a system, the greater the possible entropy; just as, to continue the analogy, a larger pack of cards increases the number of possible disordered states.5 Thus, while the second law of thermodynamics suggests that entropy will always increase, the expansion of the universe seems to ensure that there will always be more steps inserted on the path down the thermodynamic escalator toward the state of complete disorder that lies at the bottom. Whatever caused the universe to expand is also in some sense the source of order and pattern.

After the first problem—explaining how order of any kind is possible—is addressed, the second problem remains. How did complex entities emerge, and, once they had emerged, how did they sustain themselves long enough to be noticed by us (or to be us)? Paradoxically, the tendency toward increasing entropy—the drive toward disorder—may itself be the engine that creates order. It creates order on the way to creating disorder. Poetically, we can think of the steady increase in entropy as an attempt by the universe to return to its initial state of thermodynamic equilibrium; many creation myths similarly describe the breaking of an original unity, whose divided parts try to return to their initial state. In Plato’s Symposium, one of the proposed explanations of love between men and women is that it was created when the gods split a hermaphroditic being into two different creatures, whose attempts to reunite created all future generations of humans. The drive toward disorder seems to create new forms of order, just as the energy of falling water can cause droplets of water to splash upward, or a river’s current can create eddies in which small amounts of water flow against the main current.

At a local scale, and in the short run, complex entities seem to reverse the workings of the second law of thermodynamics by increasing order. But viewed within the larger environment from which they draw free energy, they clearly actually increase entropy by speeding up the transformation of free energy into unusable forms of heat. Thus complexity is, in a sense, a cunning way for the second law of thermodynamics to work more efficiently toward its bleak goal of a universe without order.6 Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers have applied the curious term dissipative to the complex structures described here.7 What complex structures do is to handle huge flows of energy and, in the process, dissipate large amounts of free energy, thereby increasing entropy overall. Though they appear to reduce entropy momentarily and locally they in fact generate entropy more effectively than do simpler structures, facilitating the deadly workings of the second law.

Nevertheless, creating order is not easy. Somehow or other, significant flows of energy need to be concentrated and focused in ways that generate pockets of increased order. Complex phenomena require a constant throughput of energy to help them climb entropy’s remorseless down escalator. So the existence of stable differentials to guarantee a steady supply of energy, such as the temperature and pressure differentials available near stars, is an essential precondition for complexity. What is not clear is whether there exist mechanisms that actively seek out complexity. Does the presence of differentials and disequilibria actively drive matter and energy toward complexity? Or do they merely make it possible? Does complexity work like natural selection, through the random generation of structures that, once they have appeared, become locked into place simply because they fit their environment well? Or does the second law create complexity through a devious cosmological cunning of its own?

Whatever the source of order, its creation, whether in the Sun or the stock exchange, requires creating structures that can channel and control large flows of energy without falling apart. This is an extremely difficult trick. And that difficulty explains why ordered entities are fragile and rare, and why they stand out against a background that is much simpler. Roughly speaking, the more complex a phenomenon is, the denser the energy flows it must juggle and the more likely it is to break down. So we should expect that as entities become more complex, they become less stable, shorter-lived, and rarer. Perhaps even a slight increase in complexity can sharply increase their fragility and, therefore, their scarcity. Of all complex chemicals in existence, only a minute fraction have ever formed living organisms; of all living organisms, án even smaller proportion has formed into intelligent, networked species such as ourselves. (Table 4.1 offers some evidence for these generalizations.) But it is also clear that the likelihood of complex entities’ appearing would be greatly increased if instead of relying on random changes to generate such structures by accident, we could identify laws that tended to actively create such structures. At present, we simply do not know whether there are such laws, though the emerging science of complexity is attempting to identify them.

What we can do is to describe some of the ways in which complex structures emerge. The fundamental rule seems to be that complexity normally emerges step by step, linking already existing patterns into larger and more complex patterns at different scales. Once achieved, some patterns seem to lock their constituents into new arrangements that are more stable and more durable than the simpler arrangements from which they are created. Such processes create the hierarchy of different levels of complexity that we observe in the universe, because at each scale, new rules of construction and change seem to come into play. These are known as emergent properties, because they do not seem to be derived from the properties of the original components; instead, they apparently emerge as these components are assembled into a larger structure. The word universe is a verbal structure consisting of eight letters. But its meaning cannot be deduced just by knowing the letters used to construct it. Its meaning is an emergent property. Similarly in chemistry, the properties of water cannot be explained by describing how hydrogen and oxygen behave, yet water is formed by combining molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Its properties emerge only when atoms of hydrogen and oxygen are combined into water molecules.8 The myriad different ways in which these rules play out at different scales and at different degrees of complexity provide the subject matter for the various disciplines of modern knowledge. Each deals with the rules that emerge at new levels of complexity, from particle physics to chemistry, biology, ecology, and history.

Being complex creatures ourselves, we know from personal experience how hard it is to climb the down escalator, to work against the universal slide into disorder, so we are inevitably fascinated by other entities that appear to do the same thing. Thus this theme—the achievement of order despite, and perhaps with the aid of, the second law of thermodynamics—is woven through all parts of the story told here. The endless waltz of chaos and complexity provides one of this book’s unifying ideas.
