title: 2 Your Brain at Work

Kerry Cuthbert was suspended from his job while investigated by his employer after he made a 1,470-mile run, all the way from Wisconsin to Florida, in one twenty-hour shot.1 That well exceeded the maximum number of consecutive hours a long-haul trucker is allowed to drive to prevent injury to himself or others. Kerry’s employer, International Logistics Group, only learned about his risky venture when he later bragged about it on social media.2

For the past decade, SmartCap Technologies has sold technology to companies that allows them to monitor their employees’ brains. From Australia to the Americas and parts of Africa, more than five thousand companies worldwide in mining, construction, trucking, aviation, railway, and other industries use SmartCap to ensure that their employees are wide awake.3

Powered by the LifeBand, a headband with embedded EEG sensors that can be worn alone or integrated into headwear like a hard hat or cap, brain wave data is processed through SmartCap’s LifeApp software, which uses proprietary algorithms to provide a risk assessment score based on the wearer’s ability to resist sleep. LifeApp presents fatigue levels on a scale from 1 to 5, from hyperalert to involuntary sleep. When the system detects the wearer is becoming dangerously drowsy, it sends an early warning to both employee and manager.4

My initial instinct was to be troubled by the idea of an employer tracking my brain activity in this way. But the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve come to believe the issues are far more nuanced. To be sure, the technology raises significant privacy concerns for employees. It’s even more troubling when they don’t know what brain data is being collected or how their employer will use it. Whatever is gained in workplace safety or productivity could be offset by the potential loss of trust, engagement, creativity, and empowerment. And yet, I think it’s possible that at least for some applications, we should embrace brain monitoring at work. It’s hard to argue that an employee’s abstract mental privacy trumps society’s very real interest in knowing that the driver of a forty-ton truck barreling down the highway is wide awake and alert.

We still have time to get this right, to thoughtfully balance the interests of employees, employers, and society. But to do so, we need to develop a new set of human rights norms rooted in cognitive liberty.





The Rise of Workplace Surveillance


By now you understand how corporations are using our data to predict our preferences and desires as consumers. But you may not realize that they are also using technology to analyze our behaviors as employees, tracking our movements and keystrokes, and now even our brains.5

The UK grocery chain Tesco was one of the first companies to employ such surveillance. In 2013, it required workers in its grocery warehousing facilities in Ireland and the UK to wear armbands that tracked their productivity. Every time a worker picked up a piece of inventory and moved it from one place to another, the armband logged those movements. It also tracked bathroom breaks.

The pushback was loud and angry. Tesco workers felt like Big Brother was watching them, and they really didn’t like it, even though it made their lives easier in some ways, like not having to carry pens and papers or log inventory manually. But as one former employee revealed, workers lived in constant fear of being called in by management for low performance scores. Even the “the guys who made the scores were sweating buckets and throwing stuff around the place,” he said.6

Maybe you’re thinking, Too bad! Employees shouldn’t take unscheduled breaks! Or that if you were in their shoes, you would just quit and go elsewhere. But most of those low-wage workers didn’t have the luxury of job mobility. And it didn’t take long before there was nowhere else to go, as surveillance became more and more common at workplaces worldwide.

That’s what keeps Stacy Mitchell, codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an organization that focuses on the risks of corporate power, up at night. Stacy told me that she believes “technology has become a tool for powerful companies to exert even more power over their workforce.” Which means that the average worker has “fewer options and less leverage” while corporations have an “incredible ability to control and intimidate” workers through surveillance tools.7

Much of Stacy’s research has focused on the growing abuses of surveillance at Amazon’s global distribution centers. Amazon also has a patented wristband to track its employees,8 as well as a broad surveillance program called AWS Panorama, which uses machine learning algorithms to process images from cameras, including the security cameras that are ubiquitous at most modern worksites. “Are people walking in spaces where they shouldn’t be? Is there an oil spill? Are they not wearing hard hats? These are real-world problems,” a senior Amazon executive said while describing the myriad ways that AWS Panorama can be used.9

The result, Stacy explained, is that workers feel “constantly rushed and prodded and prodded. And the rate at which they have to do tasks is forever increasing. As soon as they think they’ve mastered the existing rate, it goes up higher and higher.” Which means that companies like Amazon are not only “controlling people moment to moment, but also creating an environment where they can never actually succeed.”10 The mounting pressure led Chris Smalls to help Amazon workers in Staten Island to successfully unionize, and countless workers at other companies—from Walmart to Target to Dollar General—have reached out to him for help in doing the same.

Surveillance goes well beyond warehouses and extends to knowledge workers, too—a trend that began well before the COVID-19 pandemic but has grown exponentially since. In a recent survey of employers with remote or hybrid workplaces and their employees, 78 percent of employers admitted to using monitoring technology to track their white-collar employees.11 Using programs that are pejoratively called “bossware,” they take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor their keystrokes and web usage, photograph them at their desks, and track their social media usage, all in the name of increased productivity.12

Now employers are starting to look directly into employees’ brains for signs of fatigue and wandering attention. The data they are collecting will undoubtedly reveal rising stress levels in their workforce.





Tracking Fatigue at Work


In 2019, Tim Ekert, the CEO of SmartCap Technologies, boldly proclaimed that his company’s headgear would “transform the American trucking industry” by reducing fatigue risks for drivers and employers.13 Why was he so confident? Because SmartCap had just concluded a successful three-month partnership with a US-based trucking company that yielded some very impressive results. Eighty-seven drivers at two terminals in the company’s refrigeration division had worn SmartCap devices to monitor their fatigue levels while working.

One terminal operated primarily at nighttime, while the other operated 24/7. The participating drivers logged over 8,730 hours and 520,000 miles without any fatigue-related accidents while realizing a 62.4 percent reduction in fatigue-related alarms.14 That’s a remarkable achievement for what seems like a pretty minor ask.

This was far from SmartCap’s first rodeo. In Australia, where SmartCap is headquartered, mining, aviation, and gas companies regularly use its devices.15 At the Hunter Valley Operations in New South Wales, SmartCap is mandatory for truck drivers.16 BAM Nuttall, the British subsidiary of the Dutch Royal BAM Group, which employs well over twenty-five thousand people in its civil engineering and construction divisions, equips many of its employees with SmartCap gear.17 A South American mining company replaced its camera-based monitoring system with SmartCap’s EEG headsets.18 A large copper-mining operation in East Asia requires all its drivers of heavy vehicles to wear SmartCaps.19 All in all, upward of five thousand companies in mining, construction, trucking, aviation, railway, and other industries worldwide use SmartCap.

SmartCap is so successful because of its promise to reduce the catastrophic costs that drowsy employees levy on businesses and society. In Chicago, a speeding train jumped its tracks at O’Hare International Airport after its driver fell asleep and careered onto an escalator, injuring thirty-two. The driver admitted it wasn’t the first time she had dozed off at the controls.20 In New York, a sleep-deprived train engineer nodded off while operating a Hudson Line commuter train from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Terminal in New York. The train took a 30 mph curve at 82 mph and derailed, killing four people and injuring seventy, and causing millions of dollars of damage.21 In Citra, Florida, an engineer fell asleep while operating a train that was pulling a hundred carloads of phosphate and crashed head-on into a coal train. Thirty-two cars left the tracks, spilling 1,346 tons of coal, 1,150 tons of phosphate, 7,400 gallons of diesel fuel, and 77 gallons of battery acid.22 Although aviation accidents are much less common, at least sixteen major plane crashes have been blamed on pilot fatigue in the past few decades.23

Until recently, the state of the art for monitoring driver fatigue was telematics technology—hardware and software built into vehicles that inferred the driver’s drowsiness from the way they drove. Take Mercedes-Benz’s smart-sensor system. It “reads” the driver during their first few minutes behind the wheel, analyzing their steering movements and speed under ordinary conditions. If the driver later makes a number of minor steering errors that are quickly and repeatedly corrected, the sensors, computer algorithms, and software program evaluate internal and external vehicle conditions to determine if the driver is drowsy. If the answer appears to be yes, the vehicle issues an alert to the driver to take a “brake.”24 Other manufacturers offer similar systems.25 While they represented a remarkable advance when they were introduced, their accuracy rates are only between 63 and 75 percent.26

Newer telematic systems use in-vehicle cameras. These systems can be highly accurate but come at a high cost to individual privacy. One system, for example, uses facial recognition technology to analyze whether the driver is looking ahead at the road with her eyes open.27 Others use infrared cameras to monitor the driver’s head and body positions, as well as facial expressions and hand gestures.28 The German technology firm Bosch Global created an interior monitoring system that uses artificial intelligence to determine when a driver is distracted, when their eyes are becoming heavy, and even when they are looking at the passengers next to them or in the rear seat.29

EEG systems like the one used by SmartCap can be implemented in ways that are much less intrusive, as they are focused solely on brain wave activity. As our alertness wanes, our brain waves show a rise in theta and alpha activities and a fall in beta activity.30 Alpha brain wave activity alone can be used as an indicator of impending fatigue.31 Despite some important limitations—like the small number of electrodes in consumer EEG devices, which reduces the overall quality of the data being recorded; the computational complexity of classifying brain wave signals as “drowsy”; and the “noisiness” of the signal that is being captured32—even the worst-performing EEG devices tend to detect fatigue earlier and more reliably than traditional telematic technology, and the best performing ones do as well as, if not better than, facial recognition and in-vehicle cameras.33

EEG systems can be used in other employment settings where fatigue impacts safety—from factory floors to air traffic control towers, operating rooms, and laboratories. And perhaps they should! Fatigue reduces our motivation, concentration, and coordination; lengthens our reaction times; undermines our judgment; and impairs our physical and mental abilities to carry out even the simplest tasks. The result is more than $136 billion per year in productivity losses from corporate bottom lines.34

As neurotechnology and the algorithms decoding them continue to improve, EEG-based systems will become the gold standard in workplace fatigue monitoring. Not just employers but society as a whole may soon decide that the gains in safety and productivity are well worth the costs in employee privacy. But how much we ultimately gain from workplace brain wearables depends largely on how employers leverage the technology. Will employees receive real-time feedback from the devices so they can act on it themselves? Will managers directly monitor employees’ incidence of fatigue? If so, will they use that information to improve workplace conditions? Or will it justify disciplinary actions, pay cuts, and terminations of employees who suffer from fatigue more often? The answers to these questions will shape the future of brain-fatigue monitoring.

Given the lack of societal norms and laws regarding brain monitoring, for now each company creates its own.35 Some use SmartCap and similar technologies to optimize employees’ working conditions; others may use them punitively, which is consistent with how employers generally use workplace surveillance. In one recent study, 26 percent of employers had fired employees for internet misuse, 25 percent had terminated employees for email misuse, and 6 percent had fired employees for personal use of office telephones.36

While neurotech companies tout their technologies as productivity enhancers, their implementation runs the risk of backfiring. Creating clear and generally accepted norms for the use of employee surveillance is crucial to its acceptance in the workplace. One in three people already mistrust their employers, and employee trust is an essential ingredient of corporate success. Employees in high-trust organizations are more productive, have more energy, collaborate better, and are more loyal than those who work for employers they don’t trust. Employees in low-trust companies feel disempowered and become disengaged.37 Corporations in the United States are estimated to lose between $450 and $550 billion each year because of employee disengagement.38





Watching Our Wandering Brains


I used to be able to undertake marathon writing projects. I’d put on my most comfortable clothes, make myself a huge vat of hummus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and dive in to researching and writing my newest piece. A few weeks “into the zone,” and I would come up for air with a draft in hand. That all changed when I had children. Constant interruptions became my new normal. I soon realized that I needed to fundamentally change the way I work to regain my productivity.

After some fits and starts, I discovered a new method that better enabled me: the Pomodoro technique, invented by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. You choose a task to focus on, set a timer for twenty-five minutes (the original timer was shaped like a tomato, or pomodoro in Italian), and focus on one and only one task. Then you take a five-minute break and begin again.39 My children learned to wait for the timer before they interrupted me, and I learned to write in twenty-five-minute bursts.

We don’t all have the luxury or ability to focus for long stretches at a time, which is something that Olivier Oullier, the president of the bioinformatic company Emotiv, based in San Francisco, California, thinks neurotechnology can address. At the outset of a recent talk he gave at the Fortune Global Tech Forum, Oullier acknowledged that we are “not equal when it comes to focusing. Some people can focus very, very deeply for forty-five minutes. Others for two hours.”40 But the solution he offered was a far cry from my desktop tomato.

Oullier was unveiling the MN8, Emotiv’s enterprise solution for attention management. The MN8 looks like standard earbuds (and can in fact be used to listen to music or participate in conference calls). But with just two electrodes, one in each ear, it allows employers to monitor employees’ emotional and cognitive functions in real time.41

Emotiv teamed up with the German software company SAP SE to create Focus UX, a system that reads employees’ cognitive states in real time and shares personalized feedback on their attention and stress levels with both them and their managers. SAP claims this will create a more responsive workplace environment in which computers help employees focus on what they are best “able to handle at that moment.”42

Oullier described a hypothetical data scientist who is wearing the MN8 earbuds. She’s spent several hours videoconferencing with her team and is now reviewing codes. Alpha brain wave activity has been used to index the attentive state in her brain. Higher alpha power is correlated to mind wandering or inattention, while lower alpha power has been correlated with a more attentive state.43 The proprietary algorithm sees that her attention is flagging, so it sends a message to her laptop: CHRISTINA, IT’S TIME FOR A BREAK. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHORT WALK OR DO A FIVE-MINUTE GUIDED MEDITATION TO RESET YOUR FOCUS? 44 Employers can use the data to evaluate individual users’ cognitive loads, compare them across their workforce, and make decisions about how to optimize their workforce for greater productivity throughout the day. And of course, to make promotion, retention, and firing decisions.

Other companies offer similar technology, such as Lockhead’s CogC2 (for Cognitive Command and Control), which provides companies with real-time neurophysiological workload assessments so they can “understand the performance cycles of individuals and teams” and “optimize their workforce for increased productivity and improved employee satisfaction.”45

All this might remind you, as it did me, of the incredibly unpopular “attendee attention tracking” feature that Zoom rolled out at the height of the global pandemic, which informed meeting hosts when an attendee minimized their Zoom window for more than thirty seconds (maybe it’s more like that feature on steroids). Public outrage and negative media coverage quickly led Zoom to remove the feature, which was a relief to me as I multitasked through my Zoom meetings or turned away momentarily to attend to one of my children.46

In case you are thinking, Well, even if my employer tries to measure my attention, they won’t know what I am paying attention to, think again. Research on workplace engagement funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture found that with EEG, it is now possible to classify the type of activity an individual is engaged in—central tasks (e.g., programming, database, web development), peripheral tasks (e.g., setting up a development environment, writing documentation), and meta tasks (e.g., social media browsing, reading news sites).47 As pattern classification of brain wave data becomes ever more sophisticated, employers will be able to tell not just whether you are alert or your mind is wandering but also whether you are surfing social media or developing code.

Your employer might even nudge you back to work when your mind starts to wander. The MIT Media Lab developed a system called AttentivU, which measures a person’s engagement in real-time via an EEG headband. A scarf provides subtle haptic feedback in the form of vibrations whenever the wearer’s engagement declines. Researchers found that people who received haptic feedback logged higher EEG alertness scores than those who didn’t. While the Media Lab Group were excited about their results, they acknowledged the risk for misuse, saying they hoped that “no one will be forced to use this system, whether in work or school settings.”48 Given our current workplace trends, that hope seems unlikely to be realized.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. If some employees choose to use neurotechnology voluntarily to improve their productivity, others may clamor for it too. Empowering people with tools to improve their productivity while giving them control over the data they generate could allow them to reap the benefits of better time management without any sacrifice of their autonomy. Just like my pomodoro timer! As with other neurofeedback, self-monitoring for productivity can help us establish more positive work habits as we learn when and why our attention wanders.49 This can be empowering in other ways too. The more productive we are, the greater our bargaining power to demand higher wages and better working conditions.50

If brain productivity technology is imposed on workers by management and used punitively instead, we should expect employees to object to its use. Some are already doing so. Unionized workers at Rio Tinto’s Hail Creek mine in Queensland, Australia, refused to wear SmartCaps because of just those concerns in 2015.51

Those concerns resonate with my own research findings. My lab conducted a follow-up survey to our study on the sensitivity of brain data that I discussed in chapter 1. We asked 110 Americans what concerned them the most about others having access to their brain data. Far and away, their number one fear was the uses their employers might put it to, much more than governments, insurance providers, law enforcement, advertisers, hackers, or family and friends.

They have good reason to worry! Existing laws do little to protect employees from workplace surveillance. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to EU residents, creates a floor that many countries now abide by. But the GDPR and applicable local privacy legislation only requires employers to have legitimate reasons for collecting employee data. Those can include public health and workplace safety, but they also extend to workplace efficiency and productivity.52 The result is that employers who decide to adopt workplace brain monitoring are generally free to do so.

Data-protection statutes across the world strongly favor freedom of contract between employers and employees and limit government oversight that would interfere with the terms and conditions to which employers and employees agree. Take Article 329 of the Constitution of Ecuador, which forbids the use of discriminatory instruments that affect people’s privacy.53 At first glance, it appears reasonable, but it says nothing about the use of technology in the workplace for nondiscriminatory uses. In most countries, such as Mexico and South Korea, if an employee consents to the use of surveillance technology, the requirements of workplace privacy are satisfied. In practice, that means so long as brain monitoring is fully disclosed in employee handbooks and privacy notices, an agreement to work is tantamount to consent. Even Article 19 of the Chilean constitution, which secures to individuals a right to physical and mental integrity, can be abridged with consent by an employee.54

And yet, I suspect that many employers will discover that brain monitoring won’t be worth the squeeze on their employees. Monitoring brains for focus may increase stress and undermine employee morale, which could make employees less rather than more productive.55 Employees have been known to engage in counterproductive behaviors when they dislike surveillance technology, such as deliberately manipulating surveillance systems, taking great pains not to be monitored, or even falsifying their work product to meet performance requirements.56 “They basically can see everything you do, and it’s all to their benefit,” said Courtenay Brown, who works in a giant refrigerated section of the Avenel, New Jersey, Amazon Fresh warehouse. “They don’t value you as a human being. It’s demeaning.” The growing belief by workers that surveillance creates inhumane working conditions is fueling unionization efforts across the country.57

I witnessed these effects first-hand recently. Like many others, I have come to rely heavily on the gig-economy workers who deliver groceries and other essentials to our home. It’s not uncommon for our family to place several grocery orders per week with Instacart, a company that operates a grocery delivery and pickup service in the United States and Canada, from different venues in tow. One day, I placed a same-day delivery order only to realize that I had left off a few essentials. Since I had already missed the time window to update my shopping cart, I placed a second order for the next two-hour window. Twenty minutes later, I received a panicked text message from an Instacart shopper, Shannon, saying she had been working on my first order when she was assigned the second one. The problem, she explained, was that if she delivered both my orders together in the later time window, she would be penalized for delivering the first order late. “Could you call in and change the delivery time for the first order?” she asked.

Instacart employees receive weekly productivity scores based on factors like the number of on-time and late deliveries they make, how long it takes them to pick each item in the store, and the percentage of customers they correspond with. Instacart’s laser-like focus on productivity has improved its profit margin, but its shoppers live in constant fear of being fired over situations that are often out of their control, like the quandary I had inadvertently put Shannon in.58 To meet the time constraints constant monitoring has introduced, some workers skip bathroom breaks, relieving themselves in bottles and plastic bags.59

When our attention also becomes the currency of productivity measurements, employees may be driven to similarly extreme measures, such as attempting to combat even brief periods of mental downtime. This can substantially erode the quality of their contributions. Research across nine hundred Boston Consulting Group teams in thirty different countries found that downtime is critical to employee success, as it increases alertness, improves creativity, and leads to greater output quality.60 Creative ideas and solutions depend as much on minds wandering as staying on task. Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton both famously claimed that their task-unrelated thoughts were critical to the biggest problems they addressed in their work.61

Decades of medical and psychological research show the negative impact of high job demands and low job control on workers’ health. We are approaching a mental health crisis of epic proportions as billions of people worldwide struggle with anxiety, fear, and depression. COVID-19 exacerbated the problem, and unchecked brain monitoring will make it even worse. Job strain is strongly linked to depression and anxiety, the risk of ulcers, cardiovascular death, and even suicidal thoughts.62 All of which may convince even the most determined employers to give up on their efforts to monitor our attention. Many, ironically, may then fall straight into the arms of neurotech companies that offer seemingly more benign applications of neurotechnology—for example, to help employees improve their mental well-being.





The Newest Employee “Benefit”: Brain Wellness


In June of 2021, the dating app company Bumble closed its offices for a week to give its seven hundred employees time to recover from their collective burnout.63 Bumble had had a busy year, what with its stock market debut and skyrocketing growth in new users.64 CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was concerned about her workforce’s mounting stress.65

At thirty-one, Wolfe Herd had recently become the youngest woman to take a company public in the United States. As she rang the Nasdaq bell, she made known her goal of making the internet “a kinder, more accountable place,” an attitude reflected throughout Bumble’s headquarters with wall mirrors emblazoned with messages like YOU LOOK BEE-AUTIFUL HONEY and light switches telling people to SHINE BRIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND. Bumble’s employees are allowed to decide their own working hours, so long as they get their work done.66

While weeklong breaks may be unusual, stressed-out employees are the new normal. In an episode of the hit television series The Office, Dwight, a mid-level employee, set fire to the office in a misguided attempt to educate his coworkers about fire safety. Stress levels reached an all-time high as his colleagues tried to cope with the aftermath and Dwight tried to make amends. It gave us a chance to laugh at an all-too-serious and ubiquitous concern.

LinkedIn recently surveyed three thousand people in the United States and found that 66 percent of them experience the “Sunday scaries”—feeling stressed out and anxious on Sunday nights before the workweek kicks off. Forty-one percent of respondents said their Sunday night unease had gotten worse since the COVID-19 pandemic. Generation Z was even worse off, with a whopping 78 percent of them experiencing scaries. Unreasonable workloads, poor compensation, conflict with coworkers, the looming fear of being fired or laid off, and a lack of advancement opportunities are stressing them out.67

The impacts show up everywhere, with one very high-profile example being Antonio Horta-Osorio—the then relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group—who was forced to take an eight-week leave of absence in 2011. “I was very mindful that the bank was in a very weak position to face adversity. It was a problem that was going around my mind constantly, which led me to sleep less and less. And the less and less sleep progressively led me to exhaustion, and then to not sleeping at all which was a form of torture, so I had to address it and I did,” he explained.68 This led him to reevaluate the mental health of the bank’s sixty-five thousand employees and introduce a company-wide mental health awareness and corporate wellness programs.

Corporate wellness programs have scored some notable successes, helping employees lead healthier lives by eating better, exercising more, quitting smoking, limiting their alcohol intake, and having regular physicals. But stress remains a serious problem, undercutting corporate success by eroding creativity and productivity and raising health-care costs.69 This is why Aetna Insurance started investing heavily in a corporate wellness program called Mindfulness at Work more than a decade ago. Employees who participated in the program, which included mindfulness training, a dedicated “calming” space for employees, and regular speaker series, enjoyed substantial reductions in stress.70 Aetna rolled it out worldwide, and more than twenty thousand of its employees now participate in it.71

These programs foreshadowed the inevitable shift to wellness programs that directly target employees’ brains. Like the program by Nationwide Mutual Insurance, with its benefits provider OptumHealth and its partner Brain Resource, to give employees access to a web-based tool called MyBrainSolutions, which uses brain training games to enhance their positivity, emotional resilience, and decrease their stress. More than five hundred employees enrolled within the first week, giving Nationwide baseline brain assessments of its employees.72 Employees have continued taking brain assessments over time, unaware of the longitudinal data about their brains Nationwide could collect along the way. Brain Resource has since forged similar partnerships with other large companies, including Cisco, AstraZeneca, and Accenture.

As the reliability, availability, and costs of EEG devices to address stress improve, they are increasingly becoming part of these wellness programs. In January 2020, Morneau Shepell, a provider of technology-enabled human resources services, began a partnership with InteraXon to pilot the use of Muse headbands in corporate wellness programs.73 Companies that sign up for InteraXon’s program are given EEG devices for all their employees. The employees participate in live or remote-training sessions for meditation with a member of the InteraXon team. The program is split into managing thoughts and decreasing stress, which, as InteraXon’s CEO and founder Ariel Garten claims, is “exactly what people need now.”74

Having adopted a similar program for her own employees, Garten firmly believes that brain-wellness programs improve well-being. Employees at one company—their largest American client—became much more open about traditionally taboo topics in the workplace after enrolling in the program, she says—mental health, anxiety, personal challenges, nothing was off the table. “It allows people to open up and actually be more honest about what’s going on and find real solutions for it,” she claims.75

Offering the promise of decreased costs from absenteeism and mental health issues, Morneau hopes to roll out this program to its twenty-four thousand client organizations in 162 different countries. Though they also assure employees that their data will remain confidential, corporations that adopt the program as their own will not be bound by any such assurances.76

Garten herself well understands the potential risks of employers tracking employees’ brains. In 2013, when she and I first met, she was the leader of the International Centre for Brainwave Ethics, an organization that carried out research on ethics, policy, legality, and data integrity in brain wave technology. After learning about our shared interest in advancing the ethical progress of neurotechnology, she invited me to join her newly launched Center for the Responsible Use of Brainwave Technology (CeReB), which was developing best practices. In 2014, CeReB issued its first major report, cautioning about the stakes in workplace settings, particularly when hiring, promotion, or firing are tied to brain data. It concluded that “a significant ethical burden is placed on organizations wishing to utilize brainwave technology in a commercial context to clearly and transparently identify the uses of the technology and the resulting data, educate users about the potential for downstream involuntary disclosure of sensitive information, ensure that consent and opt-out provisions are clearly identified and supported (without penalty), and protect the data at a level commensurate with highly sensitive personal information.”77 Unfortunately, without the broad industry funding and engagement that it needs, CeReB has been mostly dormant in the years since.

Given Garten’s early engagement on these issues, I was surprised to see that InteraXon puts the burden of safeguarding employees on employees. InteraXon’s privacy policy explains that its Muse Connect App allows the company “to monitor … the Muse sessions of one or more people using Muse devices in conjunction with the Muse Mobile application.” While participants must “provide consent,” once they do, InteraXon can share the employee’s user activity data, processed data, and personally identifying information with their employer. InteraXon doesn’t “control the Observer’s use of that data,” they explain. Instead, employees should “review the privacy policy of the Observer.”78

InteraXon’s policy makes no mention of sharing the raw brain wave data it collects from its users, which could limit the potential misuse of brain wave data by employers as long as InteraXon is their supplier. Hopefully that will remain true as InteraXon builds out its research program with Cambridge Brain Sciences, Hatch, and others.79

Countless other neurotech companies, from Emotiv to Thought Beanie, are similarly integrating EEG into existing corporate wellness programs.80 Thought Beanie’s privacy policy offers no insights whatsoever into what data they collect from users, nor what they share with employers, while Emotiv proudly touts the availability of raw brain wave data to participating employers advertising that enterprises can “access raw EEG data and Cognitive Stress & Auditory attention performance metrics.”81

Wellness programs offer important benefits, but these data policies underscore the less visible and more dangerous privacy risks they pose.82 Most are exempt from traditional health data privacy regulations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (known as HIPAA), for example, protects individuals’ identifiable health information in the United States. But it doesn’t apply when employers offer workplace wellness programs directly rather than in connection with their group health plans. Without laws preventing them from using the data collected through wellness programs, employers can mine the data they collect, which many do with abandon.83 Employers learn everything that employees share in the questionnaires and online surveys they complete as part of these programs, from what prescription drugs they use to whether they voted and when they stopped filling their birth control prescriptions.84 And employers are using that data in increasingly more intrusive ways.

Take the phone call that Chris Zubko received three weeks after he returned to work after undergoing triple bypass surgery. “Man! I notice your steps have picked up,” his boss said. “You used to be under two thousand, now you’re over six thousand. Two times you worked out this week. Good!”85 Chris’s boss had been monitoring his recovery through the company-installed app on his phone. The call was well intended, but it’s exactly the kind of intrusion Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, finds worrisome. “The more employers known about their employees’ lives … the more potential control or effects they have on their lives,” she explained.86

The risks extend well beyond the workplace, as wellness program vendors sell the data they collect from the programs to third-party data brokers, who use it to assess creditworthiness, set insurance premiums, and target individuals for advertisements.87 The algorithms used by data brokers sometimes inaccurately interpret the data, mislabeling individuals as suffering from depression, mental illnesses, or drug or alcohol dependency, with predictably serious consequences.88 A recent report from colleagues of mine at Duke examined the practices of ten major data brokers, and revealed the highly sensitive data they hold is being used in increasingly more concerning ways to exploit consumers; discriminate against individuals in housing, insurance, and education; and even target vulnerable veterans for scams.89

These data-scraping practices are particularly pernicious when employees’ brains are involved. To realize the benefits and minimize the risks of these new programs, employees should have control over the data that is collected and be given the tools they need to act on whatever insights they supply. Employers should agree to receive only aggregate and de-identified employee brain data, which they could use to improve working conditions. Such aggregated data might show, for example, that certain activities or environments are associated with increased stress.90 EEG and deep-learning neural networks can recognize the signs of stress with more than 85 percent accuracy.91 An increase in beta waves, for example, is associated with rising stress levels and anxiety.92 If employers act on such information to improve overall workplace conditions for employees, both would benefit.

But if the data is exploited for profit, wellness programs could become the most insidious form of workplace surveillance yet. That’s why it’s crucial that we start to develop robust norms for brain monitoring. The aim is for all of us to reap the benefits of neurotechnology, while minimizing their novel risks.





Charting New Workplace Norms


Under certain circumstances and with the right controls, surveillance technology has proven itself to be invaluable to corporations, their employees, and the public writ large. At best, it can be used to protect the public from the hazards of exhausted heavy equipment operators, to identify and address harassment and bullying at work, and to root out bias and discrimination in hiring, promotions, and firing.93 The data it generates can lead to important insights that challenge outdated and detrimental assumptions.94 It’s legally required in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. But it can also be used to control employees, to discriminate against them, and to chill workers’ ability to unionize.95

Companies must adopt clear workplace policies, and governments must enact laws and regulations that explicitly spell out employees’ rights. This should begin with following the three-part test in international human rights law for determining whether a relative right like mental privacy can be limited: (1) legality, (2) necessity, and (3) proportionality. In other words, the human right to mental privacy would prohibit unauthorized access to employees’ neural data without an explicit law justifying doing so, based on a compelling societal interest in so doing, in a manner that is narrowly tailored to balance the interests of the employee with those of society. This requires an explicit statutory framework for implementing neurotechnology in the workplace for specified purposes. Only when there is a bona fide need—a necessity—for employer-to-access employee brain data—such as to monitor fatigue in a commercial driver, or attention in an air traffic controller—should employers ask to do so. Even then, they should be limited to collecting data for the specific purpose it serves, and employers should be prohibited from mining brain data for other insights about the employee to ensure that the impact on employee privacy is proportional to the societal benefit it affords.

Neurotechnology should be a tool of empowerment, not a means of control; any law authorizing the use of neurotechnology in the workplace should require employers to provide clear notice in their employee handbooks and company policies about how they intend to use the neural data collected, as well as any insights they glean from it.

Most critically, we should prefer, if not require, that employees’ raw brain data be stored on their own devices, and not on device manufacturers’, software companies’, or employers’ servers.96 Data should be regularly overwritten rather than stored indefinitely, as well.

Imagine the future of work when brain monitoring becomes more ubiquitous if these laws and norms are not in place. After a banner year at the company, division manager Sue calls employee Pat to offer her a contract renewal with a 2 percent pay raise. Sue knows the company could easily afford and would be willing to pay up to 10 percent to retain her but hopes Pat will take less. Pat takes Sue’s call using her company-issued in-ear EEG earbuds. Pat keeps her voice even throughout the call so as not to give away her emotions and promises to follow up with Sue the next day.

All the while, Sue has been watching Pat’s brain activity and decoding her emotional reaction to the news. Pat’s brain activity revealed joyfulness upon learning of the 2 percent pay raise and remained joyful throughout the day.97

The next day, Pat calls Sue and says that she was hoping for a bigger raise. But Sue can’t be bluffed; she knows that Pat was happy with the 2 percent raise; moreover, she now sees that Pat is fearful as she makes her request for a bigger one. Sue responds that 2 percent is the best the company can do, and Pat accepts the offer. Pat’s attempt to negotiate a better salary was over before it began. Even the staunchest freedom-of-contract libertarian would question the fairness of this negotiation.

Although this is a hypothetical scenario, informational asymmetry often puts employees at a disadvantage in negotiations.98 The asymmetry between the information that NBA team owners had about the revenues generated by games, and that the players had access to, for example, improved the owners’ bargaining position during lockout negotiations in 2011.99 Insider knowledge of research budgets has allowed unscrupulous traders to realize substantial stock gains,100 and firm-specific knowledge has led lenders to change how they structure corporate loans.101 When the person you are negotiating with can look inside your brain, you don’t stand a chance of getting a fair bargain.

Employers could frustrate labor freedom in other ways too. Neurotechnology can’t decode imagined speech just yet with any real accuracy.102 But it can already tell us such things as when amorous feelings are brewing between employees, what a person’s politics are, or whether someone is suffering from cognitive decline, and use it to fire them proactively without revealing the cause.103 It can lead the company to look into a breach of company policy they wouldn’t otherwise have suspected, and use the information selectively against employees who they suspect are planning to start a union. As neurotechnology hardware and software improve, employers might find it worthwhile to decode the vowels, letters, numbers, and words an employee is imagining,104 or their unspoken yes and no responses to questions.105

Absent assurances about what brain data an employer is collecting and why, employees will be less likely to organize, as they may believe that even thinking about collective action could get them fired. Someday employers could nip labor organizing in the bud by monitoring employees’ growing brain synchrony. One recent study tracked the EEG signals of high school students over a semester and found that their brain activity became more synchronized as they focused on collective tasks.106 In other words, just by looking at patterns of brain activity across employees, it might be possible to tell who is planning something together like organizing a union. Those who are less engaged with the group can similarly be identified by their lower brain-to-brain synchrony.107

The use of surveillance technology to interfere with labor organizing is not just hypothetical. Stacy Mitchell describes how corporations use surveillance technology to monitor “potential for unionization,” and as tools of “intimidation to stop workers from organizing and standing up.”108 In 2019, Google employees accused management of using a browser extension in their calendar application to ferret out future protests, claiming it “would automatically report staffers who create a calendar event with more than 10 rooms or 100 participants.”109

Employers do this because employees represented by a union demand the opportunity to bargain over the terms of their employment, including the use of new surveillance technology.110 As already mentioned, this is what happened at Rio Tinto’s Hail Creek mine in 2015, when the union learned that SmartCaps were on the way.

Even nonunion employees can organize for change. More than twenty thousand Google employees and contractors around the world walked out of Google offices on November 1, 2019, after The New York Times reported that Google had paid Android cofounder Andy Rubin $90 million, despite allegations by a subordinate, which he denied, that he had coerced her into having oral sex in a hotel room.111 Google ultimately agreed to several of their demands.

We can defend against potential abuses by invoking mental privacy as the basis for limiting the brain data that employers can collect to narrowly tailored purposes, like monitoring fatigue, an automatic unconscious process of the brain.112 SmartCap does this proactively, overwriting and discarding the raw brain wave data it collects once it has been processed through its proprietary algorithms.113 This makes SmartCap more privacy enhancing than most traditional surveillance technologies.

That’s good news, but we should remember that other neurotechnology companies can and will make different choices unless laws and norms implementing the right to mental privacy prohibit them from doing so. Even when such laws are in place, employers will gain insights from neurotechnology that they can easily misuse. As Diane Jurgens, the technology officer of the mining giant BHP Billiton (which uses SmartCap to monitor drivers of its four-hundred-ton vehicles at its copper mine in Chile) put it, “You can’t fool this cap because it’s watching your brain waves, not looking at your eyes.”114

But in doing so, employers invade the right of employees to define the terms of their own vulnerability. They bypass employees’ mental privacy right to decide with whom they will share intimate details about themselves, and when and how they will do so.

Giving employees the right to audit brain data can help to build trust and ensure that only relevant and legitimate brain data is being collected. It also provides a check on the quality of the data being collected and an opportunity for employees to challenge invalid interpretations. If brain data is used to justify sanctions—for example, demoting or terminating a driver who repeatedly drives fatigued—employers should provide clear notice of their intent to use the data in that manner.115

What’s at stake with the use of brain wearables at work is more than the safety, productivity, and stress of employees—it’s the dignity of workers, and the future of work itself. The principle of cognitive liberty won’t exclude employees from agreeing to use brain wearables at work. But those wearables can threaten mental privacy, labor freedom, and freedom of contract.

The future is already here; tens of thousands of workers are using these devices, and as neurotechnology becomes more normalized, the risk of misuse will only rise. It is past time that those laws, norms, and expectations be explicitly defined.
