title: 9 Beyond Human
---






Deprive the brain of oxygen, and within ten or fifteen minutes, its cells begin to break down, leading to irreparable brain damage and death. At least, that’s how it’s been for most of human history. But recently, a group of Yale University scientists developed a system called BrainEx, which uses an innovative series of pumps and synthetic blood to restore some cellular function to pig brains as long as four hours after the animals were slaughtered for food, bringing us that much closer to the transhumanist vision of super-longevity and Humanity 2.0.

I learned of the Yale scientists’ breakthrough in 2016, during an ethics consultation with our Neuroethics Working Group of the NIH Brain Initiative. Nenad Sestan, the leader of the research team, and three of his colleagues met with us to discuss the ethical implications of their research, which was later published in the journal Nature in April 2019, with a coveted cover appearance.1 Nature and Science are the premier peer-reviewed scientific journals, and they tend to publish only the most notable scientific advances.

What was the Yale team’s breakthrough?

Just as a heart or lung bypass can keep a patient alive long enough to repair otherwise fatal damage to those organs, BrainEx brought at least some brain repair closer to reality. By resupplying the dead pigs’ brains with oxygen, nutrients, and cytoprotective chemicals present in their synthetic blood analogue, they had restored circulation to the major arteries and small blood vessels along with certain key metabolic functions in the brains. The pigs’ brains even showed some synaptic brain activity—activity in the regions where neurons communicate with one another—when a piece of the brain tissue was removed and washed of the perfusate.2

While those particular pig brains did not recover any EEG activity—nor any signs of consciousness—that doesn’t mean that EEG activity could not one day be restored, just that it wasn’t this time. The researchers had included chemical agents in the perfusate (the synthetic blood compound they concocted) that prevented the neurons from firing.

In the short term, BrainEx will allow us to learn more about neurological diseases and functioning. But one day, it may allow us to repair the damage caused by strokes and other traumas. It’s hard not to get carried away and hope that someday human brains could be reanimated. All of this makes the goals of transhumanism—the idea that we humans may someday transcend our physical and mental limits, including death—seem within reach.

Not everyone is ready to embrace this Promethean future. A societal movement known as bioconservatism stands in opposition to these lofty goals. To be sure (and as Mary Shelley recognized over two centuries ago) transhumanists’ aspirations pose real risks for individuals and society alike. Should they be realized, it’s altogether unclear what it will even mean to be human: Will we continue to communicate with each other through spoken and written word or move toward telepathic communication? Will we acquire new abilities or even ways of seeing the world, and how will that change our experience and understanding of others? Will we upload our brains and memories to robotic or synthetic bodies? Who and how should we decide the answer to these questions?

The transformation of humanity has already begun. But most people aren’t part of the conversation about whether it is a good thing or not. To realize the promise of neurotechnology and the contours of cognitive liberty, we all must join the debate. One that has been raging for a while now between transhumanists and their opposition.





Humanity 2.0


Transhumanism is a cultural movement aimed at solving the “tragedies” of the human condition—namely aging, our physical and psychological limitations, and suffering.

It draws from across medical and scientific disciplines, including neurotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and platform technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and even cryogenic freezing. Transhumanists believe that humans are in transition to the next phase of human evolution, and that radical technological interventions are needed to complete the transformation.3 According to the philosopher Elise Bohan, author of Future Superhuman, the project of transhumanism has already begun, and it will transform our lives, bodies, and minds, ensuring the survival of our species.4

As Bohan sees it, in the future, babies will have their entire genomes mapped at birth to predict their risks of disease and develop precision treatments for them. Artificial intelligence will emerge as the most powerful entities on the planet, and humans will have to upskill to compete; human consciousness will be digitized and uploaded, giving us new pathways to immortality; and the experience of work will become radically different from what we now know. She and other transhumanists see death as “the loss of everything that matters.”5 If it were possible for each of us to enjoy robust health indefinitely, humanity would accumulate much more experience and knowledge. “The things that our species could do with that!” she exclaims. “The mysteries of the universe that we could unlock. The problems we could solve. And the depths of each other’s’ souls that we could explore.”6

The New Yorker described philosopher Nick Bostrom as “arguably the leading transhumanist philosopher today, a position achieved by bringing order to ideas that might otherwise never have survived outside the half-crazy Internet ecosystem where they formed.”7 Bostrom’s essay “A History of Transhumanist Thought” traces the origins of the term to the biologist Julian Huxley, in his book New Bottles for New Wine (1957): “The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself—not just sporadically.… But in its entirety as humanity. We need a name for this new belief. Perhaps transhumanism will serve: man remaining man but transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.”8

As the founder of the World Transhumanist Association, Bostrom has built on Huxley’s ideas, believing as he does that modern philosophers should “acquire the knowledge of a polymath, then use it to help guide humanity to its next phase of existence”—something he thinks he is doing by helping us to understand transhumanism and the “existential risks” that artificial intelligence poses to humanity.9

In the short term, Bostrom points to the ways that AI is already displacing humans from jobs, changing the nature of war to automated and remote attacks, enabling greater social manipulation, expanding surveillance capabilities, and making it easier to mislead humans with “fake” videos of real people. But the deepest threat, he argues, “is the longer-term problem of introducing something radical that’s super intelligent and failing to align it with human values and intentions,”10 something he believes transhumanism can help to address. One way to even the playing field is to extend human longevity and enhance our cognitive abilities by uploading our brains to computers—expanding the concept of human dignity to include post-humans within the definition of humanity.11 The ultimate goal is to live longer, have unlimited intelligence, and live without suffering.12

Biopolitics—a new dimension of political opinion—aligns the odd bedfellows of traditional conservatives and extreme liberals against it as bioconservatives. Bostrom believes it could be possible to stake out a middle ground but argues that cultural conservatives have “gravitated towards transhumanism’s opposite” instead, embracing a view that stands in opposition to using technology to expand human capabilities or modify human beings.13

Bioconservative theorists worry about what transhumanism will mean for human identity and meaning. Philosopher Leon Kass believes that trying to assert technological mastery over humanity could have a dehumanizing effect on humanity and strip meaning from everything in life from sex as an intentional act for intimacy and reproduction, eating for pleasure and not just for honing our bodies, and the dignity of work as artificial intelligence displace human workers.

Francis Fukuyama, another widely recognized bioconservative, has described transhumanism as “the world’s most dangerous idea.”14 Fukuyama believes that “liberal democracy depends on the fact that all humans share an undefined ‘Factor X’ which grounds their dignity and rights”—and he worries that the radical technological enhancement of humans may “destroy Factor X.”15

In his 2009 book The Case Against Perfection, Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel expresses concerns about the impact of transhumanism on human values. What will happen to unconditional parental love when everyone is focused on creating a more “perfect” child? He sees attempts to harness nature as vain endeavors that undermine our humility and solidarity with one another and places the responsibility for our existing limitations on each of us rather than accepting the variation between humans.16

But as Bostrom argues, the two groups share some commonalities. Both bioconservatives and transhumanists worry about “existential risks” to humanity. Both agree that technology is likely to change humanity in this century, and that we must grapple with the ethical implications of that transformation. Though bioconservatives favor using technologies just for therapeutic purposes to treat existing medical conditions, while transhumanists believe we are morally obliged to use technology to do that and more to improve the human condition, both contingents worry about their side effects and unintended consequences.17

Silicon Valley, not surprisingly, has aligned itself with transhumanism. Google was an early investor in the biotech start-up Calico, which hopes to “answer the most challenging biological questions of our time.”18 The billionaire and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has invested heavily in parabiosis—blood transfusions from younger, healthier individuals to ward off aging—and has even signed up with the cryogenics company Alcor to be deep-frozen when he dies.19

While neurotechnology is just one cog in the transhumanists’ expansive agenda, how society approaches those advances may very well decide the fate of Humanity 1.0. Between BrainEx and advances in memory decoding, deep brain stimulation, and brain-to-robotic interactions, neurotechnology has already expanded human abilities well beyond what we once thought was possible, and it stands to do even more to minimize human suffering and maximize our well-being.

How should we evaluate the potential upside of these developments against their hypothetical risks? We begin where any good ethical analysis must: by understanding the facts about what is already possible.





The Infinite Mind


Cryonics makes use of extremely low temperatures to preserve bodies until technologies are developed that enable them to be revived or have their brains uploaded into computers. BrainEx may set us on the path to doing so.

Alcor Life Extension Foundation calls it “paus[ing] the dying process.” One hundred ninety customers have plunked down between $80,000 and $200,000 for brain- or whole-body-preservation services, including Nick Bostrom.20 The moment he dies, Alcor will take custody of his body and maintain it in a giant steel bottle flooded with liquid nitrogen.21

Nectome preserves brains, too, but its goals are more ambitious. Its website describes its focus on understanding and preserving the connections in the brain and the memories it stores. While in the near term, Nectome expects to provide society with better models to advance the study of the brain, in the long run, it aims to turn those preserved brains into computer simulations that could allow a reboot of the “person” in digital form.

All of this may sound like science fiction, but Antonio Regalado of the MIT Technology Review, who has his finger on the pulse of emerging technologies, has advised us to “pay attention to Nectome. The company has won a large federal grant and is collaborating with Edward Boyden, a top neuroscientist at MIT, and its technique just claimed an $80,000 science prize for [cryo]preserving a pig’s brain so well that every synapse inside it could be seen with an electron microscope.”22 They have successfully used aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation on a human brain as well.

While some, like neuroscientist Michael Hendricks, have decried brain and body storage as offering “abjectly false hope,” calling “burdening future generations with our brain banks … just comically arrogant,” Edward Boyden disagrees: “As long as they are up-front about what we do know and what we don’t know,” he says, he isn’t particularly concerned about the ethical implications.23

Does self-determination include the right to decide whether to cryopreserve one’s brain or body? Does the burden that places on future societies offer a sufficiently strong countervailing societal interest to justify government limitations on individual choice for doing so? People are doing this already. Is it too late to pull the plug on the cryopreserved?

Of course, if it’s just immortal consciousness that transhumanists seek, we may soon have other ways to successfully realize their hopes. As implanted brain–computer interfaces become a reality, so may the possibility that those devices could create a living copy of the brain that just might achieve the same goal.





Tracing Our Memories


“I want a beer,” the thirty-six-year-old man said, and then asked to have the rock band Tool played “loudly.” Those around him heard his words clearly, but he hadn’t said them out loud. That’s because he was in the late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that had robbed him of any control over his muscles. Before losing voluntary movements, he agreed to have electrode arrays implanted in his brain with the hope that in time they could help him communicate. Three years later and several months after he could no longer even move his eyes, he successfully used his brain–computer interface (BCI) device. “I love my cool son,” he told his four-year-old, composing his thoughts at a rate of one character per minute. He then asked for a head massage, and for specific foods to be fed to him through his feeding tubes.24 “Ours is the first study to achieve communication by someone who has no remaining voluntary movement,” said Dr. Jonas Zimmerman, one of the scientists behind this extraordinary feat.25

The company that has likely made the most progress toward using BCI to help paralyzed patients like this one is Blackrock Neurotech, whose ethics advisory board I recently joined. Its FDA-cleared NeuroPort Array has been in use for more than a decade. The microelectrode array is implanted in the motor cortex, the area of the brain that naturally controls movement. When patients imagine moving their arm or hand, the device detects those signals and transmits them to an external device, which communicates with prosthetic limbs or other technology, allowing patients like Aaron Ulland, who suffered a major stroke that left him partially paralyzed at just thirty-nine years of age, to move his arm again through an attached brace.26

Cognixion is testing its wearable Cognixion One EEG headsets with augmented reality (AR) visors for patients to do the same.27 The ease and safety of a wearable device like this one will make it the BCI of choice in the near term. But if Elon Musk has his way, implanted BCI may soon catch up.

Musk is best known as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, but in the long run, he may be remembered most for another venture. Since 2016, he has been quietly developing futuristic BCI technologies at Neuralink, a company he cofounded with Max Hodak. Neuralink is developing an implantable BCI called “the Link.” About the size of a small coin, the Link is designed to replace a tiny piece of the skull. Electrical wires about one-twentieth the thickness of hair and tipped with 1,024 electrodes, extend from the device into the brain, where they pick up electrical signals and transmit them to an external computer or device. (Someday it might manipulate those signals as well.) The Link’s battery lasts all day and can be recharged wirelessly. Neuralink is building a robot that can carry out the most challenging aspects of the surgery, with the hope that the procedure will ultimately take less than an hour and not require general anesthesia. 28

While Neuralink expects that the Link’s first clinical trials will be in patients with spinal cord injuries, Musk’s ambitions are much grander. Describing it as a “Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires” he hopes to make it “sufficiently safe and powerful that the general population would want” to use it. Musk imagines it augmenting human abilities by transmitting information into the brain (like The Matrix but without the painful jack into the back of the head) and allowing us to record and play back our memories.29 Ultimately, he imagines it transforming humanity, giving us the competitive edge we will need to hold our own against the “existential risks” of artificial intelligence.

Neuralink’s video updates—including one of Pager the macaque monkey playing video pong with his mind in 2021—show a steady march of progress. While prominent neuroscientists are quick to point out that other BCI companies are farther ahead, given the relatively easy way the Link will be implanted, its wireless capabilities, and the sheer force that is Elon Musk, it may very well outstrip its competitors, bringing us that much closer to the transhumanists’ goal of BCI for everyone.30 And the transhumanists’ vision of uploading our minds.





The Immortal Mind


A recent study at BrainGate—an interdisciplinary multi-institutional effort to develop technology to restore independence to individuals who suffer from brain disorders—suggests BCI might be the tech that will make uploading our brains a reality. In a notable experiment, a paralyzed patient played a game in which he watched colored lights flash on a computer screen and reproduced their patterns by moving a cursor on the screen. The BrainGate BCI device he was wearing recorded the way his neurons fired as he thought about moving the cursor to replicate the pattern. That night, as he slept, the researchers saw that same pattern recurring again and again in his brain.31 While they were excited about what this teaches us about memory consolidation during sleep, a transhumanist would see the potential for brain recording and, potentially, uploading.

The reality of mind uploading is more complex than its theory: the basic idea is to copy the entire structure and functions of a human brain, including all memory traces, creating a software model that when run on the appropriate hardware would behave like the original, advancing the theoretical possibility of living forever, albeit in digital form.32

To realize that vision, we will need safer and less complicated ways of recording brain activity. And at least one company has already beat Neuralink to clinical trials that can do so. Neuralink’s cofounder Max Hodak left the company in April 2021 and invested in a rival BCI company, Synchron,33 that has invented a new and potentially safer, easier, and more scalable way of getting into the brain. Instead of drilling a hole in the skull or strapping a device onto the body, Synchron uses the “stentrode”—a device that looks like a small tube of wire mesh, and remarkably can be implanted via a catheter, much like the stents that physicians use to treat heart patients. The stentrode is fed into the jugular vein in the neck and threaded through a blood vessel that enters the brain. The device is tuned to detect the electrical signals that travel from the brain to give instructions to the limbs and fingers to move. Those signals, relayed through Bluetooth to a device outside the body, are translated by algorithms into computer commands. CEO Thomas Oxley describes it as “bringing electronics into the brain without the need for open-brain surgery.”

Four Australian patients with neurodegenerative disorders have been implanted with the stentrode and are able to email, text, and even shop for groceries using only their minds.34 Synchron has also started clinical trials in the United States. Once widescale safety and efficacy have been established, it’s not hard to imagine that even a healthy individual might want a stentrode to more seamlessly interface with technology or reach just a little closer to digital immortality.





Beyond Human Senses


While companies developing implantable BCI devices are focused on therapeutic applications, it’s useful to remember that many modern consumer technologies—such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech—were originally designed as accessibility technology. Even eye-tracking in AR and virtual reality (VR) glasses started as accessibility tech.35

Transhumanists believe technology can and should be used to enable human beings to transcend our physical and mental limitations. From communicating directly from our brains, to acquiring new senses or new ways of interacting with the world, transhumanists see neurotechnology as a gateway to human evolution.

BCI that is designed to restore our senses may soon be used to expand our senses too. Take Second Sight’s legacy product, Argus II, which was surgically implanted into the brains of more than 350 people with retinitis pigmentosa, who had little to no sight. The technology afforded them a novel kind of artificial vision by stimulating their retinas to perceive light and low-resolution images. Its next-generation product, the Orion Visual Cortical Prosthesis System, hopes to bring artificial vision to people who are blind from a wide range of causes.36 But some people have already enhanced their vision beyond what these devices—or the healthiest eyes—could hope to see.

One of them is the artist Neil Harbisson, who was born with achromatopsia—complete color blindness. Over the last thirteen years, Harbisson has been able to “hear” visible and invisible wavelengths of light through the antenna-like sensor he had implanted in his head. The antenna translates wavelengths of light into vibrations on his skull. As he told National Geographic, “I wanted to create a new organ for seeing.… At first I could just sense the visual spectrum of light, but I’ve upgraded it to include the infrared and ultraviolet spectra.”

Much as Bohan believes transhumanism will enable us to explore the depths of each other’s souls, Harbisson believes his expanded senses have transformed his “understanding of the world” and made it “more profound.” Sense enhancement, he argues, is “just the beginning of a renaissance for our species.”37 A renaissance that may soon include even telepathy.





Augmenting Human Communication


Something that has stayed with me since first hearing the CTRL-labs presentation by Josh Duyan in 2018 was the transhumanist ideal he described of moving humanity from efficient “input devices” to efficient “output devices” by enabling us to operate octopus-like tentacles with our minds. If we can operate tentacles, we can communicate brain-to-brain, or even operate swarms of drones—something researchers are already making progress toward. The only limit on what we can accomplish with BCI is our imagination.

A recent experiment shows that brain-to-brain communication is already possible.38 Researchers at the University of Washington ran an experiment where three different people in three different rooms played a Tetris-like game with one another, communicating using BCI. The object of the Tetris-like game was to nudge a falling block into the correct position so it could come to rest on a line at the bottom of the screen.39 Three players sat in different rooms, equipped with EEG headsets and one with a transcranial magnetic stimulation device (TMS), as well. Two of them—the “Senders”—could see both the block and the line but couldn’t control the game. The “Receiver” could see and move the block with his mind, but he could not see the line. Each Sender decided whether the block needed to be rotated and would pass that information along using their brain signals via TMS to the brain of the Receiver, who then decided whether to rotate the block. “To deliver the message to the Receiver, we used a cable that ends with a wand that looks like a tiny racket behind the Receiver’s head,” explained researcher Andrea Stocco, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington. “This coil stimulates the part of the brain that translates signals from the eyes.… We essentially ‘tricked’ the neurons in the back of the brain to spread the message that they have received signals from the eyes. The participants have the sensation that bright arcs or objects suddenly appear in front of their eyes.” The Receiver used his EEG device to rotate the block in response to the Senders’ advice. Five groups of participants played sixteen rounds each, “winning” 81 percent of the time, or thirteen out of sixteen trials, which is well above chance.40

Brain-to-text messaging is also on the horizon. In a collaboration comprising researchers from Singapore, China, and the UK, two people communicated whole words to each other using the power of thought. This system—which the researchers call an electromagnetic brain–computer metasurface—uses the same P300 “recognition memory” we saw in chapter 3. The participants successfully sent such phrases to each other as HELLO WORLD, HI, SEU, and BCI METASURFACE during a recent trial. And far more quickly than the ALS patient could order his beer! They were able to send twelve characters per minute—a rate likely to improve substantially when predictive spelling algorithms are also used.41

Panagiotis Artemiadis, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Arizona State University, described a BCI future in which we can “extract information from the brain” to go well beyond our ordinary capabilities, “to control systems and machines that do not resemble anything the brain was made to control.” He demonstrated this recently when he tested the ability of a single person to simultaneously control three drones with their mind. When they thought about shrinking or expanding the shape of the drones’ formation, an EEG device captured the intention, translated it via algorithms into control commands, and sent them to the drones.42

In the past, we made devices that overcame human limitations, using prosthetic limbs, hearing devices, eyeglasses, dentures, and even GPS technology for people like me, who can rarely find their way around otherwise. With BCI and other technology, we may augment our senses to see spectra of light we have never seen, hear soundwaves we could not hear, even smell danger that we could not sense before. Or even to eliminate certain human experiences that until now were fundamental to the human condition—like suffering after loss or tragedy.





The End of Human Suffering?


If your brain had a switch to turn off suffering, would you use it? I wonder if I would have to lessen my suffering after our daughter Callista’s passing, regaining the year that followed which remains just a hazy blur in my mind. That may now be possible with a brain implant that disrupts the signals that lead to pain and suffering.

A team at the University of California, San Francisco, implanted a BCI device in Sarah, a patient who previously suffered from intractable depression. “When we turned this treatment on, our patient’s depression symptoms dissolved, and in a remarkably small time she went into remission,” Dr. Katherine Scangos, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist told CNN. “It was like a switch.”43 A year later, Sarah is free of both depression and any side effects from the treatment.

The study team began by mapping the areas of Sarah’s brain that became active when she was experiencing the worst symptoms of her depression. Then they implanted a small wire into her brain that delivered a pulse of electricity to disrupt the signals. While the treatment is highly individualized and will likely require years of refinement, it offers great promise. Sarah described “laugh[ing] out loud,” and the “joyous feeling [that] washed over” her the first time the team used stimulation.44 Could we map other forms of suffering and bathe future humans’ brains with that same joy? Should we?

Flow Neuroscience, which purchased the company Halo Sport, offers a wearable device to alter the brain with transcranial direct current stimulation. Olympic athletes used it to stimulate their motor cortexes and improve their rate of learning in preparation for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.45 That same technology is now being used to alleviate the symptoms of depression. They claim a success rate of 83 percent.46

Treating depression isn’t the same as eliminating suffering; Sarah can still experience joy and sadness, and even more so now that her depression is under control. But therapeutic applications to disrupt the symptoms of depression point the way for transhumanists to realize their long-held goal of eliminating human suffering. It sounds appealing, but it may have unintended consequences.

Writer Joelle Renstrom derides the transhumanists’ call to end human suffering as “irresponsible, socially divisive, and inherently egotistical in its assumption that suffering is universally undesirable and meritless.”47 Physical pain, after all, alerts us to impending danger. Transcending sadness and tragedy, she argues, helps us learn how to thrive in the face of adversity and develop the confidence that we can prevail when we face future challenges. Moreover, it is the duality of sadness and happiness that makes “happiness more powerful,” by giving us the full breadth and depth of emotional experience. Instead of maximizing our well-being, pursuing the end of suffering may “beget the very suffering it seeks to abolish.”48





Bending the World to Our Will


As neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, and robotics continue to advance, we can expect a future that bends more to our will and adapts more to our minds. When neural interfaces become the predominant way that we interact with our technology, we will be that much closer to a future in which policies are evaluated based on their impact on our “collective cognitive capital,” as Emily Murphy, of the University of California, San Francisco College of Law, put it. It’s a concept she coined to describe a new approach to public policy that would evaluate how programs or policies impact our brain health and functioning as a collective asset for humanity to maximize.49

Penn State researchers are working to create a future in which human workers wear EEG headsets to provide input to their robot coworkers, who calibrate the pace of work to our state of mind.50 In one experiment, research participants donned EEG headsets that detected signs of stress and increased or decreased cognitive load. Their robotic coworkers reacted by slowing down, speeding up, or keeping a steady pace, giving the worker just the right amount of room to maximize their productivity without stressing them out.51

Microsoft’s Human Factors team similarly helped Microsoft adapt its products to be more responsive to our brain health and functioning. when working remotely. Based on information captured by EEG headsets, they discovered that during video calls our brains struggle to keep track of everything from misaligned eye gazes to missing body language and hand gesture, tiring us out after thirty to forty minutes and raising our stress levels for another two hours. When given the chance to rest between meetings, the brain resets and our stress levels decline, allowing us to become more focused and engaged in subsequent meetings. Based on this knowledge, Microsoft changed how it schedules meetings, and even redesigned its popular Outlook calendaring program to enable other companies to start meetings five minutes after the hour or half hour, to allow for breaks.52

Even our experience with art is starting to bend to our brains. The start-up company Cuseum hopes to adapt our future art museum experiences to maximize our brain engagement. In a ten-month study, it measured museumgoers’ brain wave activity as they encountered real paintings, 2D images of the same works on an iPad, and the works seen through an Oculus virtual reality headset paired with an iPhone. Based on the participants’ brain activity, it found that their immersion in the art was just as strong when seen in AR/VR as when viewed in physical space—if not stronger. While we should take these findings with a grain of salt—as their research was based on a small sample size, and the company’s goal is to sell technology to art museums—it nevertheless points to a probable future in which our experiences with work, art, and technology may constantly adapt to optimize our brain activity.53

Artists from the American cellist YoYo Ma to Korean performance artist Lisa Park have begun using neurotechnology as part of their artistic ventures, as well. After a presentation I gave at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in 2016, YoYo Ma approached me to ask whether there are any good studies on using consumer neurotechnology while listening to music. Two years later, he surprised unsuspecting Montrealers with a free concert at the Place-des-Arts Metro station in downtown Montreal, while joined by Olivier Ouillier of Emotiv to demonstrate the impact of music on the brain.54

Park’s project, Eunoia, which means “beautiful thinking,” “manifests” her brain waves into sounds.55 Masaki Batoh documented the devastation of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami by using EEG headsets to measure the brain waves of victims and play them back as music for his album Brain Pulse Music.56

The progression toward Humanity 2.0 is already underway; the ground is shifting beneath us as our environment starts to become increasingly responsive to our brain activity.

But while that transformation has already started, a public dialogue has not yet begun. If we want to balance our cognitive liberty with societal interests, it’s time for everyone to join the conversation.





A Path Forward


In May 2010, a team of scientists from the J. Craig Venter Institute announced that they had created the world’s first self-replicating synthetic cell—an organism whose “parents” were the chemicals that are the building blocks of nature and a computer program. The media went wild with the “horrifying and wonderful” idea of “whipping up a new life form in a lab.”57

Soon after, President Barack Obama asked our Bioethics Commission to make it our first order of business to deliberate about the milestone and provide a set of concrete recommendations about an ethical pathway forward.58 We approached the task through a process of deliberative democracy—engaging with the existing literature, hearing from and exchanging ideas with scientists and engineers, faith-based and secular ethicists, and the many other stakeholders who would be affected by these advances. We held public meetings and listened and exchanged ideas on different perspectives about the science and ethical approaches to address potential risks and benefits, and the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks worldwide.

This model—of engaging in democratic deliberation via bilateral dialogues—is a conceptual framework that our chair, Dr. Amy Gutmann (then president of the University of Pennsylvania), had refined in her own scholarship. In our first report, New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies, we endorsed “the importance of robust public participation in the development and implementation of specific policies as well as in a broader, ongoing national conversation about science, technology, society and values.”59

This approach may help bioconservatives and transhumanists find more common ground, even as their competing perspectives inform the careful oversight these developments will require. Policymakers worldwide will need to better engage the public in an ongoing dialogue about neurotechnology. Scientists and entrepreneurs will need to be as transparent as possible about their potential uses and listen to competing views and a broader set of stakeholders.

Just as members of different religious and secular traditions, civil society groups, and other stakeholders must be heard and their perspectives valued, scientists need to become an increasing part of the conversation, making clear what is scientifically possible and impossible. To that end, they should receive better training in public communication. We will need to continue to equip society with scientific and ethical literacy by ensuring that manufacturers provide clear and effective disclosures. Private foundations, public institutions, and governments all have a role to play. As we wrote in our report, “scientific research and public education about science are best approached as mutually related, even mutually dependent, endeavors.”60 Public literacy about neuroscience and its technologies is critical to empower people to exercise their rights to mental privacy, self-determination, and freedom of thought—that cognitive liberty comprises.

As for the risks of the kind of radical human transformation advocated by transhumanists?

My fellow commissioner, the late philosopher John Arras of the University of Virginia, asked: “What is the proper attitude in dealing with events which are in low probability range, but high in impact?… One way of handling risk is to be proactive: Go full speed ahead, worry about risks later. This supports the values of scientific freedom and focuses on the benefits that derive from it. The other extreme—the cautionary proposal … there must be a promise of mitigation before one goes forward with research.” Arras advocated for an Aristotelian approach, which was to take the middle road: consider all views on a subject and then present findings based on deduction and practical consideration. A view we as a commission embraced. “We call it prudent vigilance,” Arras explained. “We recommend having ongoing assessment as the risk develops. We argue that research goes forward but with lots of safeguards.”61

Ongoing assessment of the risks of neurotechnology is already happening. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the International Neuroethics Society, the IEEE Brain initiative, and the NeuroRights Foundation, to name but a few, have held convenings to discuss ethical progress in neurotechnology. A group of corporate executives and scholars have called for a White House task force to “craft a roadmap for the effective governance of applied neuroscience technologies.” Our Bioethics Commission launched a similar dialogue with our Grey Matters reports, but there has not been another US Presidential Commission on Bioethics since 2017, with the necessary convening power to continue the conversations.

Other disruptive technologies have developed effective models and best practices that can serve as a roadmap. CRISPR, a technology that allows scientists to make precision edits to our DNA, has garnered international attention and dialogue to develop ethical norms to maximize its benefits for society. Stanford Law professor Henry T. Greely has chronicled the history of those discussions.62

In January 2015, a small working group of scientists, ethicists, law professors, and more came together to focus on the most ethically concerning aspect of the use of CRISPR in humans—editing embryos, which could impact future generations by making changes to our “germline” DNA—the DNA we pass on to future generations through egg and sperm cells. The group quickly agreed that CRISPR was an important advance for humanity, but that it should not yet be used for human-germline editing. They published an editorial discouraging that use and calling for an international forum to engage a broader set of global stakeholders on its applications.63

Soon thereafter, the National Academy of Science and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created a Human Genome Initiative to guide future conversations. The initiative convened an International Summit on Human Gene Editing in late 2015, which was jointly sponsored by the Royal Society in the UK and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the end of the meeting, the organizing committee issued a statement on their own behalf that “It would be irresponsible to proceed with any clinical use of germline editing unless and until … the relevant safety and efficacy issues have been resolved.” They called for ongoing conversations to establish “broad societal consensus” about future applications of CRISPR technology. 64

To achieve that broad consensus, they identified the important role of government investment and participation in supporting an international forum to engage representatives from the sciences, medicine, public policy, patient and patient advocacy groups, industry, and more. The Human Genome Initiative remained at the helm to bring those conversations to fruition, ultimately leading to a consensus report that was issued as the “‘official position’ of the Academies” in 2017.65

The path to minimizing the risks of the technology hasn’t been without bumps. A bombshell revelation at an International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong in November 2018 was a stark reminder about the importance of ongoing prudent vigilance. A researcher from Shenzhen revealed during the meeting that he had used CRISPR to edit the genomes of embryos to attempt to make them resistant to HIV. And more shockingly, he had transferred those embryos to a woman’s uterus who fell pregnant and delivered genetically edited twins. The summit organizing committee, world scientific academies, and prominent scientific leaders decried the research as “deeply disturbing” and “irresponsible.”

We could see this as a failing of international norms to police unethical uses of technology. But I think it teaches us otherwise. Because his actions ran counter to established norms, the global condemnation was swift and unambiguous. This has prevented other scientists from following in his footsteps. His grave misstep also reminds us about the interrelationship between norms and their enforcement. Prudent vigilance requires regular oversight of emerging technologies, and the adoption of enforceable laws and regulations to address risks as they emerge.

Since the November 2018 meeting, the various scientific academies across the world have established a commission to “develop a framework for scientists, clinicians, and regulatory authorities on the appropriate use of human germline genome editing.”66 A group that continues to monitor the technology as research evolves, updating international norms, engaging stakeholders in an ongoing dialogue, and providing governance recommendations to guide regulators worldwide.

The time is now right for us to establish an international body to provide the same kind of oversight for neurotechnology. To engage society in an ongoing process of democratic deliberation, and to maintain prudent vigilance over the progress of neurotechnology. That body should include delegates from scientific organizations worldwide, representatives from ethics, religious, and civic organizations, members of the public, patients and their families, and other stakeholders from across society. We will also need the focus and determination of every country to strike the right balance between progress in neurotechnology and individual liberties, and to enforce international human rights at a national and local level.

We can’t yet know all the risks and benefits that will come from the ongoing project of transhumanism. But we can continuously assess both the scientific progress and the risks it entails to maximize the benefits of neurotechnology for humanity.
