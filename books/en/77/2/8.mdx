title: 8 Bewilderbeasts
---






It was the fifth meeting of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, and the main item on our agenda was the adequacy of existing federal standards for research on human subjects. The ballroom at the Warwick New York Hotel had banquet-style chairs lined up in rows for the public. Every seat was filled, and there were standees in the aisles and along the sides of the room.

The thirteen commissioners sat around a U-shaped table. Our chair, then president of the University of Pennsylvania, Amy Guttman, and vice-chair, then president James Wagner, of Emory University, sat next to each other where it curved, at the head of the room. I was seated at the end of one of its arms, close to the audience. It consisted of people mostly dressed in conservative business attire and seemed to radiate an almost palpable energy.

We had posted a notice in the Federal Register inviting public commentary and had received more than three hundred submissions in advance. Only a few would have time to speak in the allotted hour for public comment, and each was given a minute and a half to address the commission. One at a time, they approached the microphone.

The first to speak was a middle-aged Black woman, dressed in a conservative long-sleeved gray sweater, with a colorful scarf tied around her neck. Squinting through her glasses at the prepared statement shaking in her hand, she read it quickly and passionately. “I’m a targeted individual,” she began. “Gangstalking and harassment, nonconsensual biotechnology application is being used on me.” I glanced worriedly at a fellow commissioner.

“I now experience involuntary limb movements,” she continued. “I receive stingings. I get pains to my head … I get ringing in my ears … I get pulsing sensations in my body. I get an electrical current, an electrical sensation that goes up and down through my body and can be isolated to different parts of my body … I feel as though I am being roboticized.”1

She invited others in the room who shared her experience to stand up, and suddenly half the audience was on their feet. A second person approached the microphone. This one had an unkempt mane of gray hair, wire-rimmed glasses, and he was squeezed into a suit that was a little too small on him, with a powder-blue button-down shirt underneath. Midway through his remarks, he broke down in tears.

“I’ve been a victim of ongoing nonconsensual human subject experimentation for my entire adult life,” he said, “and possibly may have been a victim since my childhood. I have been targeted with ongoing microwave weapons, as well as drugging with neurotoxic contaminants covertly placed on articles of clothing, as well as on other personal possessions.”2

One after another they spoke, as our vice-chair compassionately moderated, validating their right to be heard and the importance of what they had to say. I became fearful for my safety toward the end, as one man aggressively approached the microphone and demanded to know whether our chair had received his letter and reached out to President Obama as he’d asked.

Growing numbers of people around the world believe that the government, their employers, and even their neighbors and friends are subjecting them to constant surveillance, harassment, and mind control. These self-described targeted individuals, or TIs, have their own vocabulary—google “targeted individual” or “gangstalking,” and you’ll enter their world.

While investigating the proliferation of their claims in online forums,3 Amelia Tait, a reporter for MIT Technology Review, turned to psychologist Lorraine Sheridan and stalking expert David James for insights. Sheridan and James had recently published an article detailing the results of an anonymous survey of 128 people who claimed to be TIs subjected to gangstalking, a term that has emerged to describe a feeling of being stalked and harassed by a group of people.

Tait and Sheridan sorted their claims into three buckets: (1) “cases where the resources or elaborate organization required to carry them out made the alleged activities highly improbable”; (2) “cases in which the activities described were impossible (e.g., minds of friends and family being externally controlled; use of ‘voice to skull’ messages … insertion of alien thoughts; organized electronic mind interferences.… Invasion of an individual’s dreams at night)”; and (3) “cases where the beliefs were not only impossible, but bizarre (e.g.,… remote enlargement of bodily organs).”4 All of them “were highly likely to be delusional in nature” and “indicative of paranoid delusional systems.”5

Joel Gold, a professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine and coauthor of Suspicious Minds: How Culture Shapes Madness, explains how as technology evolves, people with delusions incorporate those advances into their delusions. Given the ubiquity of digital tracing and closed-circuit video cameras, he says, it’s natural to believe we are under constant government surveillance. Modern technologies “are the seeds of reality that people use to build their delusion upon.”6 Those seeds of reality—real technologies and government programs with aims to surveil and control people—get incorporated into common narratives thanks to online forums where people gather and share their research, beliefs, and perceptions with one another.

We beefed up security for subsequent meetings and invited public comments in writing only. While individuals who believe they are being persecuted are more likely to spiral into depression and isolation than violence,7 it is not uncommon for them to perceive hostility in social situations, which on very rare occasions can have deadly results.8

Aaron Alexis, a thirty-four-year-old US Navy contractor who said he had been hearing voices and was being harassed through microwave mind control, shot and killed twelve people and injured three others in the Washington Navy Yard in 2013.9 Gavin Long, a former marine, carefully planned an ambush that he carried out on his twenty-ninth birthday, killing three law enforcement officers and injuring three others in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2016, after posting messages and videos online claiming he was under constant surveillance.10 Myron May, previously a successful lawyer, asked in an online forum whether others had been “encouraged by your handler to kill.” After leaving voice-mail messages in which he said he was being attacked by energy weapons, and that he would expose his persecutors “once and for all,” he opened fire in the Florida State University Library, killing three people.11 Semmie Williams posted thousands of social media messages and videos claiming he was being followed, mocked, and sexually assaulted, and that police were targeting him with electromagnetic field weapons.12 In December 2021, he was arrested and charged with the murder of Ryan Williams, a teenager from Palm Beach Gardens. His public defender says that Williams suffers from “long-standing and persistent mental illness.”13

In recent years, several self-identified TIs from all walks of life—doctors, lawyers, military personnel, artists, and others—have presented their claims before legislatures, government commissions like ours, and in courtrooms, hoping to raise public awareness about what they believe is an international human rights issue.14 As an advocate for human rights protections to secure our mental experiences, I often hear from them. While I am never quite sure how to respond or what I can do to help, their pleas keep coming.

It is against this background, and only with great trepidation, that I will examine the “seeds of reality” that underlie a handful of their claims. As paranoid as it might sound, and as troubled as most self-described TIs undoubtedly are, at various times and places throughout history, governments have indeed attempted to develop mind-control capabilities—and some of those efforts have continued to this day. Because of their capacity to rob of us our personhood, agency, and very capacity to make choices, they are among the starkest threats to our self-determination and freedom of thought.

For most of the topics I’ve covered thus far, there have been shades of gray; our cognitive liberties are not always absolute. But when it comes to the weaponization of mind control, virtually every example is clearly over the line.





MK-Ultra and Mind Control


I’m usually checked out when watching (yet another) animated film with my kids, but How to Train Your Dragon 2 had me riveted. Toothless, the lead dragon, had succumbed to mind control by the alpha dragon, Bewilderbeast. Toothless eventually breaks free, but not before he is forced to kill a human. My daughter Aristella was heartbroken, and I was shaken as I connected what I was seeing with what I was learning about governments’ modern and historical attempts to become Bewilderbeasts themselves.

In 1953, as the Korean War was coming to an end, a number of startling stories about American prisoners of war (POWs) emerged. Some had publicly confessed to crimes that the United States categorically denied—like carrying out biological warfare. Others became “turncoats” and refused to return to the United States.15 The CIA was convinced that they had somehow been “brain-washed” by the Communists, via a combination of drugs, behavior modification, and torture.16

Addressing a gathering of Princeton alumni on April 10, Allen Dulles, the newly appointed CIA director, spoke out vehemently against suspected “Soviet brain perversion techniques,” calling them “abhorrent” and “nefarious.” He worried that war had become as much an ideological “battle for men’s minds,” and that the West was handicapped when it came to “brain warfare,” because mind-control was so inimical to our core values.17 He set out to change that.

Three days later, Dulles launched the top secret CIA MK-Ultra program, earmarking $25 million so the United States could develop its own “mind-control” capabilities.18 Marie D. Jones, coauthor of the book Mind Wars: A History of Mind Control, Surveillance, and Social Engineering by the Government, Media, and Secret Societies, described MK-Ultra’s ultimate goal as the discovery of a way to erase “the subconscious of a victim and replac[e] [it] with a new way of thinking.”19

The CIA believed the Soviets were using lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, on American POWs.20 So, Sidney Gottlieb, a biochemist who had been leading the CIA’s own search for a “truth serum,” arranged for the CIA to buy up the then-existing world supply of LSD and planned a series of experiment to unlock its mysteries 21—some using volunteers, some in which the drinks of CIA employees were spiked without their knowledge.22

MK-Ultra went on to include at least 144 different subprojects, carried out across 89 known institutions, including some major universities.23 In its quest to find the most effective means of hacking the brain, the program inflicted electroshock therapy, hypnosis, polygraphs, radiation, drugs, toxins, and chemicals on willing and unwilling subjects alike. “Patients at psychiatric hospitals, prisoners in federal institutions, and even people in the public were given drugs without their awareness or consent and experimented upon,” according to the investigative journalist and historian Tom O’Neill.”24 CIA officers in Europe and Asia used these techniques on captured spies.25

Some of the most devastating experiments took place at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada, where the Scottish-American psychiatrist Dr. Ewan Cameron used an aggressive combination of customized drug cocktails and extreme “depatterning” techniques on his unsuspecting patients. This “depatterning” treatment was meant to return them to an infantile psychological state so he could rebuild their minds. He began by inducing an insulin coma in the patient, then exposed them to audio recordings of messages like “Your mother hates you,” which were repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Alternately, he used Page-Russell shock therapy, administering electrical currents at forty to seventy-five times the recommended strength to wipe their memories clean. We don’t know how many of these subjects died, but we do know that those who survived were never the same. Many suffered profound personality changes, lost their memories, or became uncontrollably violent.26

The CIA knew even then that these studies were deeply unethical and intentionally hid them from public view.27 With telling irony, they brought in German and Japanese war criminals and vivisectionists and invited them to share what they had learned from their own experiments on prisoners.28

When John Vance, a member of the CIA inspector general’s staff, learned about the use of “unwitting nonvoluntary human subjects” in 1963, he insisted MK-Ultra be ended or brought in alignment with current ethical norms. By this time, anxieties about brain control had become widespread. Michael Wood, a lecturer at the University of Winchester’s Department of Psychology, credits the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate, a story about a soldier manipulated by mind control into killing a politician, for bringing MK-Ultra out of the shadows and into pop culture.29

The CIA steadfastly denied the program’s existence until Congress investigated in 1977.30 By then, much of the evidence had been deliberately destroyed.31 Most of what we know about MK-Ultra today comes from several boxes of records that had been overlooked, as well as the scant CIA testimony before Congress.32

“MK-Ultra sounds so cartoonish, almost like the dastardly scheme of a Bond villain,” says Wood, “but its origins are based on verifiable facts and that gives it an uncomfortable edge.”33 An American six-part docudrama miniseries, Wormwood, released on Netflix in 2017, tells the true story of the bacteriologist and biowarfare expert Frank Olson, who fell to his death from a hotel window after unknowingly being dosed with LSD. In May 2022, Cinedigm acquired North American rights to the thriller MK Ultra, about a psychiatrist who finds himself in an ethical quandary when he is recruited to oversee part of the program.34

MK-Ultra is also, of course, one of the critical “seeds of reality” that animates modern conspiracy theories. When the rapper Cardi B was caught on camera staring into space during a red-carpet interview at the 2018 Grammys, conspiracy theorists leaped on it as modern proof of ongoing MK-Ultra mind control.35 Online forums are rife with MK-Ultra claims. Mass shooters are frequently identified as “MK-Ultra puppets” acting under mind control.36 Marie Jones worries that the assimilation of MK-Ultra into popular culture may numb us to the stark reality of what transpired, trivializing the work of “people [who are] seriously studying the history of MK-Ultra,” and making it that much likelier that the same abuses will be committed again.37





Modern-Day War on the Brain


The past is already present in China. In late 2021, the US government blacklisted twelve Chinese institutes and firms it believed to be working on dangerous “biotechnology processes to support Chinese military end uses,” including “purported brain-control weaponry.”38 This followed reports that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is investing heavily in warfare techniques for “cognitive domain operations,”39 including $85 million allocated by the PRC’s Ministry of Science and Technology in 2020 to fund AI research, and “brain-inspired software and hardware, human-machine teaming, swarming, and decision making.”40 A recent US Pentagon report describes the growing focus by the Chinese on intelligent warfare, as well as intelligent swarms (such as drones that move collectively in response to a single command), AI-based space confrontations, and cognitive-control operations.41

Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga, a China specialist at the RAND Corporation, calls this nothing less than an “evolution in warfare, moving from the natural and material domains—land, maritime, air, and electromagnetic—into the realm of the human mind.”42 The PLA, he says, hopes to “shape or even control the enemy’s cognitive thinking and decision-making” abilities.43 From disinformation campaigns to modern weapons targeting the brain, Dulles’s “brain warfare” is rapidly becoming a reality.

Translated Chinese military reports obtained by the Washington Times further support these reports. “War has started to shift from the pursuit of destroying bodies to paralyzing and controlling the opponent,” said one, titled “The Future of the Concept of Military Supremacy.”44 This is in accord with publications by Chinese National Natural Science Foundation–funded scientists, who have urged China to invest in military brain science (MBS). The brain, they argue, is the “‘headquarters’ of the human body,” and weapons “[p]recisely attacking the ‘headquarters’” will soon become “one of the most effective strategies for determining victory or defeat in the battlefield.”45 More research is needed, they say, into “the damaging effects to sensitive target areas of the brain tissues by acoustic weapons, laser weapons, high-explosive weapons, and electromagnetic weapons.” “Brainwave interference” and “infrasound weapons,” they say, are being developed that “interfere with brain tissue and cause insanity through resonance.”46 “Interfering with the brain,” they write, “can affect mentality, influence thinking, and affect decision making to create a whole new ‘brain war’ combat style and redefine the battlefield.”47

Like other countries, the United States is investing heavily in military applications of brain–computer interface (BCI) technology in the hope of creating super soldiers that can control swarms of drones with their minds, communicate and upload data brain-to-brain, and identify targets subconsciously.48 But BCI is extremely vulnerable to hacking, and Chinese scientists point to the military potential for doing just that.49

Gina Raimondo, the US commerce secretary, recently expressed concern that China will use its developing capabilities in cognitive control on its own citizens—including Uighur Muslims, more than a million of whom are being held in camps in Northern China.50 “Unfortunately, the People’s Republic of China is choosing to use these technologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of ethnic and religious minority groups,” she cautioned.

China has called the US sanctions “unwarranted suppression” that violate free trade. The spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the United States, Liu Pengyu, described the projects in question as designed for the well-being of China’s people.51 But persistent claims of unexplained brain injuries from diplomats around the world could make anyone wonder whether it’s just China’s citizens who are in the crosshairs of these frightening new technologies.





Losing Our Minds


One of the most insidious things about losing your mind is that other people can’t see when it happens. When I am debilitated by a migraine, no one but me is aware of the pain I am experiencing. But sometimes, even we don’t realize when our minds are no longer our own.

When Barbara Lipska, a neuroscientist and director of the Human Brain Collection Core at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, started to lose her mind, she didn’t connect the dots between what she was experiencing and what she had spent most of her lifetime studying. In her memoir The Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind, she remembers one ordinary morning in 2015. She got up and dyed her hair, then she went out for a run.

When Lipska returned much later than typical for her, her husband was shocked by her appearance. “The hair dye that I put in my hair that morning dripped down my neck. I looked like a monster,” Lipska said. Over the next two months, Lipska experienced symptoms that looked a lot like dementia and schizophrenia. In an interview with NPR, she described how she changed “from a loving mother, grandmother, and wife, into a kind of heartless monster. I was yelling at my loving husband. I was yelling at my beloved grandsons and my children. I was behaving like a two-year-old with a tantrum—all the time.”52 What she didn’t realize is that her mind was under assault, in her case, by the cancerous tumors that were growing in her brain. Once diagnosed, and treated, she was one of the lucky people who recovered fairly quickly. Despite some lasting effects—such as a loss of vision, balance, and spatial orientation—she regained full control of her mind.

Mind control provides fertile ground for narrative nonfiction and science fiction alike. Of the many depictions of mind control in science fiction, a few stand out for me: Robert A. Heinlein’s 1951 classic, The Puppet Masters, in which US intelligence officers fall prey to sluglike telepathic aliens; Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange, with its Ludovico Technique—a form of mind control that makes its antihero, Alex, feel pain whenever he has a violent or antisocial impulse; and probably most important in my life and thinking, George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes both direct and indirect mind control through the artificial language of Newspeak.

Or who could forget the powerful scene in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when Harry is subject to the Cruciatus Curse, also called the Torture Curse, and Voldemort takes hold of his mind:

Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus curse. The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was … white-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain;.… And then it stopped … “A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, “… that hurt, didn’t it, Harry?”



These real-life and fictional stories force us to grapple with the terrifying possibility of losing our minds. When you add to this common anxiety the reality of governments’ past, present, and future weaponization of cognitive control, the people who spoke before our committee don’t seem quite so delusional.

Recent claims by US service personnel make it plausible that the thing we fear is already here.

Scores of US diplomats stationed in Cuba and China started reporting in 2016 that they were experiencing strange mental ailments including recurrent headaches, blurred vision, vertigo, and hearing strange sounds. Scientists and the intelligence community have been stumped on its cause. Deliberate physical attacks, involving unknown brain-control technology? Psychogenic symptoms, or subliminal attacks on the human mind? The acute onset of the symptoms, the consistency across so many of the reports, and the high-level government personnel involved have led some to conclude these reports can only be explained as a coordinated attack by an unknown adversary.53

Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, was one of the victims. She had previously served in the Pentagon, in Iraq, in the Defense Intelligence Agency, and at the National Counterterrorism Center. In the summer of 2019, while she was working at the White House in Washington, DC, she experienced a sensation that felt like a physical blow to her head while climbing a stairway in the West Wing. Describing it on 60 Minutes, she said felt “this piercing feeling on the side of my head, it was like, I remember it was on the right side of my head and I got like, vertigo. I was unsteady, I was, I felt nausea, I was somewhat disoriented, and I was just, I remember thinking, ‘Okay, you gotta—don’t fall down the stairs. You’ve gotta find your ground again and steady yourself.’”54 About a year later, she experienced the same thing while walking to her car.

A senior member of the National Security Council claimed he suffered a similar attack while on the exact same stairway. He couldn’t speak or think clearly and was taken to the ER for treatment. Miles Taylor, deputy chief of staff and later chief of staff of the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, claimed he was hit in late April 2018. He described waking up in the middle of the night in his apartment to an eerie sound, “a sort of chirping, something between a cricket and a digital sound.”55 About five weeks later, it happened again, leaving him feeling as if he had suffered a concussion. Dozens of Americans overseas reported hearing a similar sound before experiencing acute symptoms of their own.56

By June 2021, more than 130 US officials in Cuba, China, Russia, Colombia, Austria, the United Kingdom, and more had reported similar events.57 By 2022, the intelligence community had surmised that some unseen weapon was being deployed against Americans’ brains.58 The reports were taken so seriously that they prompted rare bipartisan action by the US Congress to unanimously pass legislation, signed into law by President Biden, to secure compensation and medical care to victims with confirmed brain injuries.59

The US Department of State turned to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to consider the possible sources of the injuries, which in turn created the Standing Committee to Advise the Department of State on Unexplained Health Effects on US Government Employees and Their Families at Overseas Embassies. While the NASEM Committee’s investigation was hampered by lack of access to the service personnel and classified information, they nevertheless found a unique set of clinical signs and symptoms that didn’t fit the pattern of any existing neurological condition.

What was distinct about these reports was the nature and onset of the initial symptoms: “the sudden onset of a perceived loud sound, a sensation of intense pressure or vibration in the head, and pain in the ear or more diffusely in the head.”60 These features made it difficult to simply blame psychological or social factors, even though some of the differences between the claims might be explained by them. Though clinicians at the University of Pennsylvania, to whom the US Department of State had directly referred personnel and family members for evaluation following potential exposure while serving in Havana, Cuba (hence the name Havana syndrome), found evidence of brain damage,61 the Standing Committee didn’t believe the evidence was clear enough to medically classify the phenomenon. Ultimately, it concluded that a directed radio frequency (RF) energy attack was the most plausible explanation. The acute onset of symptoms made chemical exposure unlikely, and the symptoms themselves were “consistent with RF effects.”62

Other scientists were deeply skeptical of the committee’s findings. Cheryl Rofer, a former chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, found it implausible that a microwave weapon was involved. “Aside from the reported syndromes, there’s no evidence that a microwave weapon exists—and all the available science suggests that any such weapon would be wildly impractical,” she wrote in Foreign Policy.63 After the University of Pennsylvania published its findings of brain damage in 2019, fifteen eminent neuroscientists and physicists published a letter calling the work “deeply flawed” with “poorly founded conclusions” that were likely the result of political pressure.64 Other scientists attributed the reports to mass psychogenic illness, arguing that directed energy weapons are in their earliest stages of development, and thus incapable of achieving the kind of targeted injuries that victims claim.65

Medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew has written multiple books about mass psychogenic illnesses throughout history, citing more than 3,500 different cases over time. You can “make yourself feel sick if you think you are becoming sick. Mass psychogenic illness involves the nervous system, and can mimic a variety of illnesses,” he explains. Take “Bin Laden Itch.”66 Thousands of US schoolchildren broke out with itchy red patches between 2001 to 2002, after a Florida man was diagnosed with anthrax poisoning, and the nation was gripped by fears of terrorism following the unprecedented September 11, 2001, attacks. The rashes disappeared without further progression, and there was never a medical explanation for the cause. This is a classic example of mass psychogenic illness, Bartholomew explains, which is not something “all in the head” but produces real physiological symptoms. He thinks the simplest and most logical explanation for Havana syndrome is the same, because it has the classic hallmark of the phenomenon: starting with high-status opinion-formers, spreading among a closely knit group of individuals, occurring in a high-stress environment, colored by the power of suggestion.

A recently declassified summary of the findings of an expert panel convened by the Biden administration, however, agreed with the National Academies’ findings, despite the lack of physical evidence in support of an RF weapon.67 The panel was established to identify potential mechanisms behind what are now being called Anomalous Health Incidents affecting US government personnel. It examined thousands of classified documents and interviewed some of the individuals who had reported symptoms, focusing on five potential causal mechanisms: acoustic signals, chemical and biological agents, ionizing radiation, natural and environmental factors, and radio frequency and other electromagnetic energy.68

Curiously, many sections of the declassified report were redacted, including the entire section on how pulsed electromagnetic energy would work and the kinds of antennas that would be needed to propagate such a signal. The entire next paragraph was also redacted, which specified the way that such a weapon would be deployed. The panel was not tasked with, nor did they opine on the question of “whether a foreign actor may be involved.”69

It came as a surprise to many in the intelligence community when, in January 2022, the CIA issued an interim report implicitly agreeing with Bartholomew by attributing all but about two dozen of the claims to stress. A CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity admitted “We have so far not found evidence of state-actor involvement in any incident,” although the agency has “not ruled out the actions of a foreign actor.”70 This was news to a number of senators and congressmen on intelligence committees, who had seen information that pointed toward the use of directed-energy weapons.71 Jim Giordano, a senior fellow in biotechnology, biosecurity, and ethics at the US Naval War College, who was brought in as a government advisor after diplomats fell sick, told The Guardian that he believes that Russia has continued Soviet-era research into directed-energy weapons, and that China already has those capabilities.72

Both the mystery and the investigations continue. In May 2022, a senior Biden administration official who spoke at a White House briefing said “we are working across the interagency and State Department and with allies around the world as well to get to the bottom of the anomalous health incidents. And at this moment, we do not have a conclusion as to the attribution.”73

Has China or Russia perfected and deployed electromagnetic weapons? Or is this a contagion of psychogenic illnesses? The crucial issue is that these weapons are either being developed or have already been deployed.





Self-Determination and the Capacity for Choice


In November 2020, François du Cluzel, a project manager at NATO ACT Innovation Hub, a community where experts and innovators collaborate to tackle NATO challenges, issued a report titled Cognitive Warfare, which identified the human domain as the next battlefield frontier. The nations of the world are in a race to weaponize neuroscience, he wrote.74 Which is why he believes that NATO should already be working to establish a common understanding of when and how cognitive weapons can be deployed in a manner consistent with law and accepted international norms, and how the Law of Armed Conflict would or should apply to the use of cognitive technologies by military forces in the future.75 To do this, he argued, we will have to update our understanding of customary international law, and the treaties that govern conduct during war, including the Geneva Convention and law of the Hague.

The weaponization of neuroscience potentially robs individuals of the very principles upon which international human rights law is founded—the principles of dignity and agency. Thus far, we have grappled with the right to self-determination over our brains and mental experiences, concluding that our right to self-determination includes the right to be free from societal interference with our brains unless our choices directly affect the interests of others. That right must also include freedom from interference with our capacity to make choices—a freedom that may, under limited circumstances in armed conflict, be subject to exceptions, but not in times of peace, and never to prosecute undeclared wars against people’s minds.

Targeting brains to destroy, coerce, or control people’s mental experiences compromises human agency and dignity and defeats our right to self-determination. Doing so also violates our freedom of thought by robbing us of the ability to think freely—the most drastic form of manipulation we have encountered. Weapons targeting the human brain may render us unable to make our will effective or strip us of our capacity for freedom of will altogether. While we cannot and should not attempt to regulate every appeal to our unconscious brain processes, attempts to seize, disable, and override human agency fall well outside those bounds.

To fill the void that Du Cluzel identified, we should look to international human rights guidance on freedom of thought and psychological torture, including the guidance recently issued by Nils Melzer, the former UN special rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. In his March 2020 report to the UN General Assembly, Melzer argued that states are using psychological torture to circumvent the more widely accepted ban on the physical infliction of pain that was adopted in 1984. Although his report was primarily focused on other means of bombarding the mind, he nevertheless noted that advances in neuroscience could be exploited to inflict “invisible” pain via psychological torture.76

Psychological torture has long been treated as analytically distinct from other forms of torture.77 It shouldn’t be. It can inflict just as much suffering as other forms of torture and dehumanizes a person by robbing them of their personhood. Article 1 of the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment defines torture to include “severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental…”78 But the tools of psychological mind control don’t always inflict severe pain; allowing actors to circumvent the Covenant’s restrictions. But expanding our interpretation of “suffering” in international law to prohibit debilitating a person’s mind would eliminate the gray area that governments have exploited.

From solitary confinement to coercive interrogation, psychological torture has been deployed as a tool of governments across the world and across time. Given the rapidly growing focus on cognitive warfare, Melzer recommends that states incorporate definitions of psychological torture as a subcategory of torture, “to include all methods, techniques and circumstances which are intended or designed to purposely inflict severe mental pain or suffering without using the conduit or effect of severe physical pain or suffering.”79

His report cites historical “mind control” experiments as well as “new and emerging technologies” that “give rise to unprecedented tools and environments of non-physical interaction,” lending urgency to his plea. There may be gray areas around these practices that will be difficult to properly categorize. But we cannot and should not continue to “deny, neglect, misinterpret or trivialize psychological torture” as something distinct from the infliction of “physical pain or suffering.” Melzer argues that while modern technology may make a person suffer less physical pain or fewer lasting scars than traditional forms of torture, in light of “international obligations in relation to the prohibition of torture in good faith (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, arts. 26 and 31) and … the evolving values of democratic societies (A/HRC/22/53, para. 14), it seems wrong to exclude the profound disruption of a person’s mental identity, capacity, or autonomy only because the victim’s subjective experience or recollection of ‘mental suffering’ has been pharmaceutically, hypnotically or otherwise manipulated or suppressed.”80

Several treaty provisions, including Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, expressly prohibit “medical or scientific experimentation without free consent.” And we could, and perhaps should, decide that certain kinds of experimentation constitute psychological torture, such as making a person an unwitting participant in mind control experiments, or using electromagnetic weapons to experiment with disabling a person’s mind. Even if those interventions do not cause severe pain. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture, a regional convention, paves the way, with a definition of “torture” that includes “methods intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.”

Just as our understanding of self-determination and freedom of thought must be updated to consider emerging technologies, so must our inalienable right to be free from psychological torture. Weapons directed at the mind rob us of control over our brains and mental experiences. This form of manipulation is a stark violation of our freedom of thought. When they are intended to obliterate our personalities, identities, and mental functioning, they should fit within an updated definition of psychological torture as well.
