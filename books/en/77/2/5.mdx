title: 5 Revving Up
---






An audience member at a recent talk approached me with a question. Her son Ethan was preparing for his SATs, and she wondered if she ought to encourage him to take an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug on test day to improve his performance. Ethan didn’t have ADHD, but she knew that a lot of healthy students take ADHD medications to improve their concentration and enhance their school performance. Admission to college has become so incredibly competitive, she explained, that Ethan would need whatever help he could get.

We talked about some of the risks and benefits of ADHD drugs, including the idiosyncratic ways that people respond to them. I cautioned her that it would be particularly risky for Ethan to try a new drug for the first time on test day, because he wouldn’t know how it would affect him. She nodded, concerned about that possibility. But she didn’t ask me the one thing that many others may have also pondered: Would taking a prescription drug that was not medically necessary give Ethan an unfair advantage over other students whose parents may not know a friendly doctor, or have the means to pay for one? Would Ethan be cheating?

I don’t know what Ethan decided to do. What I do know is that if he did take an ADHD drug on test day, he would have joined the legions of other healthy people who are asking their doctors to prescribe or are purchasing drugs on the black market to enhance their brains.1 Bookstore shelves are overflowing with titles like The Genius Within, that describe the huge array of licit and illicit drugs, behavioral modification strategies, and physical devices that purport to unlock more of our brains’ potential.2 Consumers are game, trying out each new offering, dubious though their efficacy may be, hoping to gain a cognitive edge.

A recent study revealed that the rate at which healthy people take brain-enhancing drugs nearly tripled between 2015 to 2017, from approximately 5 percent to almost 14 percent.3 In the United States, nearly one in five respondents had used a brain-enhancing drug. From prescription drugs for ADHD like Adderall (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine) and Ritalin (methylphenidate) to narcolepsy medications like modafinil and even illegal stimulants like cocaine, the trend is rising across individuals and populations.4

Ethan’s profile fits squarely within the largest contingent of healthy users—eighteen-to-twenty-five-year-olds taking Adderall or related drugs. Most get them from their friends or family members who have prescriptions.5 Whether (and if so, how much) these drugs improve their brain performance is unclear. Published studies on the value of cognitive enhancers for healthy people suffer from small sample sizes and their conclusions vary depending on the kinds of brain functions that are tested.6 But at least some drugs seem to work. Healthy, non-sleep-deprived people who take the stimulant modafinil enjoy improved attention, executive functioning, and learning.7 They may similarly experience improvements in memory or the rate at which they process information after taking Ritalin or other prescription stimulants.8 Some drugs, such as those that increase acetylcholine in the brain by blocking the action of the enzyme cholinesterase, can improve memory, alertness, verbal fluency, and creative thinking.9

Even if Ethan opted not to take a drug, he could join the growing ranks of consumers who use dietary supplements. Because of long-lasting brain fog in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the makers of products like Prevagen, a supplement that contains vitamin D3 and apoaequorin (a protein in jellyfish); omega-3 fatty acid supplements; ginkgo biloba;10 and nootropics like Mind Lab Pro—which all promise to improve memory, focus, and overall brain health and function—are experiencing skyrocketing demand worldwide, even though the evidence in support of their claims is modest at best and the dietary supplement industry is largely unregulated.11

The brain-training game industry is also booming; it was worth a whopping $8 billion in 2021.12 These games are designed to exercise our brains, much the way we exercise our muscles.13 Many of the techniques they incorporate can produce modest improvements in working memory or other task-specific functions, but they require substantial investments of time and money.14 That said, some of the game makers’ claims about their effectiveness have been so overblown that members of the scientific community issued a consensus statement in 2014 to caution consumers about the glaring lack of studies linking specific games to specific improvements.15

But for at least two of these games, that may no longer be the case. When Australian scientists weighed the scientific evidence for the efficacy of brain training games, they found that the studies backing up BrainHQ and Cognifit were well designed, controlled, and properly randomized. People who played these games for a few weeks had measurably improved processing speed, attention, memory, reasoning, and executive functioning.16

These effects may be even stronger when brain training is paired with the use of a consumer EEG device that enables learning reinforcement by neurofeedback. Neurofeedback gives us real-time control over our brains.17 When we can see how our brain wave activity changes in response to certain things we do, we can change our behavior to change our brains. While these products are still in the developmental stage, the global market for neurofeedback devices is expected to reach $57 million by 2025.18

Yet other ways to track and hack our brains are on the horizon. Elon Musk hopes to soon begin clinical trials of “the Link” (implantable electrodes being developed by his company Neuralink) to create direct brain–computer interfaces for people with paralysis, which could one day be used to enhance healthy people as well.19 Other major corporate players, like Synchron and Blackrock Neurotech, are even further along with their implanted neural chips.

What should we make of all of this as an industry? Is it enabling a society of cheaters? If that is the case, does that mean we are also cheating when we ingest sugar,20 caffeine,21 cocoa, curry powder, Bacopa monnieri, folic acid, and even herbal remedies, which have all been shown to boost our cognitive performance?22 How about when we take SAT preparation classes? Music enhances our brain function, as do good nutrition and regular exercise. Is it cheating to listen to Mozart while we jog and then eat a healthy breakfast? Will cognitive enhancers further widen the gap between haves and have-nots?

Perhaps we need to think about brain enhancements in a different way.





Operation Varsity Blues


For a clear example of cheating, consider the scandal now known as Operation Varsity Blues. In March 2019, the US Department of Justice arrested more than fifty people who had participated in it, among them Hollywood actors and other wealthy parents, exam administrators, and athletic coaches from Yale, Stanford, USC, Wake Forest, and Georgetown University. Rick Singer, the scheme’s organizer—the founder and CEO of the Key, a “Private Life Coaching and College Counseling Company”—collected nearly $25 million to ensure that students received preferential treatment in admissions because of falsified athletic accomplishments, and to help them cheat on their ACT and SAT exams.23 They did this by paying doctors to diagnose the students with learning disabilities so they could qualify for special accommodations, like being given extended time on their tests. Once the accommodations were granted, they changed their testing center to one where the proctor was on Singer’s payroll. On test day, either paid ringers would take the tests instead, or the proctor would feed the students correct answers. Sometimes the parents didn’t tell the student about the arrangement; in those cases, the proctor would correct the exams after the students had finished.24

The public was rightly outraged at the spectacle of these wealthy elites rigging the system in favor of their privileged children at the cost of all the genuinely high-caliber students who lost their spots to them.25 As the trials proceeded, the conversation shifted to the already-skewed processes of college admissions in the United States. Parents can donate huge sums of money to universities to gain a leg up for their children when they apply.26 As one reporter put it: “Fraud and bribery are shocking, yes. But fraud and bribery’s lawful cousins—legacy preferences, athletic recruitment, and other admissions practices that lower the bar for progeny of the rich and famous—are ubiquitous.”27

The blatant cheating that was part of this scandal—passing off someone else’s work as your own—is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. As early as the 1970s, several US states passed laws against term-paper-writing services and other businesses that enable academic cheating.28 Many states make it illegal to fraudulently obtain or even attempt to obtain any diploma, certificate, or other instrument purporting to confer any literary, scientific, professional, or other degree at any institution of higher education.

Other countries do the same. Australia has a new law in draft that tackles contract cheating by students. The law defines cheating as completing an assignment or work for a student, providing any part of a piece of work or assignment, providing answers for an examination, or sitting for an examination in the place of a student.29 Under a similar law, six people were jailed in China for helping dozens of students cheat on China’s national exam for graduate schools. The group provided the test-takers with wireless transmitters and receivers and instructed them to read the questions aloud. Using textbooks and other resources, off-site researchers sent them the correct answers.30

Everyone agrees that it’s wrong for students to cheat. But where do we draw the line between what counts as cheating and what doesn’t? Where on that spectrum should we put the use of brain-enhancing goods or services while preparing for exams? Are the advantages that they confer necessarily unfair?

At least one academic institution seems to think so.





Cognitive Enhancements on College Campuses


In 2011, in response to pressure from students, my home institution, Duke University, changed its academic integrity policy to count the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs for nonmedical reasons as cheating. Violators faced expulsion. According to Duke’s policy: “Cheating is the act of wrongfully using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, study aids, or the ideas or work of another in order to gain an unfair advantage. It includes, but is not limited to … the unauthorized use of prescription medication to enhance academic performance.”31

Notably, the university didn’t consult with bioethicists or any other faculty on campus. Other universities have also struggled with what to do about the use of ADHD drugs by neurotypical students. Wesleyan University has an “Adderall clause” in its Code of Non-Academic Conduct.32 Like Duke, it calls out nonprescription use of Adderall as academic dishonesty.33 Even Great Britain’s Academy of Medical Sciences characterizes the unauthorized use of neuroenhancers, which they called “study drugs,” as cheating, very much like the use of steroids in sports.34

Some schools, such as Vanderbilt University and Phillips Exeter Academy, attempt to regulate neuroenhancers in the same way that they do illegal recreational drugs. While prescription drug abuse is considered a serious-enough offense to merit expulsion, they do not list it as an academic offense.

Still other schools make it hard for students to obtain prescriptions for ADHD drugs on campus: California State University, Fresno, requires two months of testing and extensive paperwork before the student health office can diagnose ADHD. Even then, a student must sign a formal contract, agreeing to submit to drug testing, see a Fresno State therapist regularly, and not share the pills. The policy also “does not allow early refills to replace lost or stolen medication. Urine tests can be required should a university clinician suspect that a student is not taking the pills as prescribed.”35 The University of Alabama and Marist College require students to sign similar contracts, while George Mason forbids its clinicians to diagnose ADHD. William & Mary clinicians refer ADHD students to off-campus providers for their prescriptions, while Marquette’s require students to sign releases allowing them to phone their parents for full medical histories. The University of Vermont will not perform diagnostic evaluations for ADHD. North Carolina State, Georgia Tech, and Penn State refuse to do evaluations for ADHD because of the volume of requests and the “time it takes to do the evaluations right.”36

Like the students at Duke who pushed for a change in the school’s academic integrity policy, the people who crafted these rules believe that taking these drugs creates an “unfair advantage for the users who are willing to break the law in order to gain an edge,” and that students who take advantage of such chemical “shortcuts” have poor work ethics and are depriving themselves of the opportunity to develop stronger time-management skills.37





Is It Really Cheating?


While it’s undoubtedly illegal to obtain prescription drugs under false pretenses, I believe that these universities get the moral calculus wrong. Improving our brains’ function isn’t cheating, whether we do it through studying, exercising, diet, brain-training games, devices, or neuroenhancing drugs. The gradual improvement of our brains over time is fundamental to human flourishing; it is a social good that we can and should pursue. Moreover, it is a social good that we pursue all the time.

To the extent that smart drugs and devices improve our focus, motivation, attention, concentration, memory, we ought to celebrate rather than prohibit them. We are all constantly striving to open our minds up to new experiences and improve our ability to learn new things. Why should we treat a new way to do so as impermissible?

Better brain functioning can make us more successful at work, enhance our earning potential, reduce our likelihood of experiencing social and economic difficulties, and improve our overall health. What’s at stake is at the core of cognitive liberty—the right to self-determination over our brains and our lives.

While it’s true that college admissions in the United States are becoming more competitive, and that access to and the use of brain-enhancing drugs could conceivably raise a student’s chances of qualifying for a more elite school, that benefit is one that other students could equally realize should they also use those brain-enhancing goods. One person’s use does not trade off with another’s, just as one person’s enjoyment of a concert, art installation, or good meal will not trade off with another person’s enjoyment of the same. What’s unethical is unfairly limiting access to them. Moreover, restricting access to cognitive enhancements is most likely to burden those who are the least well off. The haves will find a work-around to gain access—a friendly private doctor, for example—while the have-nots will continue to be left behind.

Widespread improvements in cognitive function could lead to significant benefits for society. Shouldn’t we want our scientists, factory workers, truck drivers, and other members of society to operate more effectively, with better concentration and capabilities? If using brain-enhancing drugs, games, or devices enables us to study harder and longer while learning and retaining more, won’t that improve our odds of solving many of the ills that plague society? Of curing diseases like cancer, now the leading cause of death? Won’t it speed the development of tools that bring us closer together, solve social ills, and allow us to create more beauty in the world, while improving our overall happiness? Shouldn’t we encourage, rather than quash such opportunities?

As for whether some people may have access to these drugs while others do not, that would suggest that we as a society ought to make access to those drugs, games, and devices more rather than less equitable. Not ban them or deem it cheating to use them. Making them more available is a better way to level the playing field than restricting access to those few who can game the system to obtain them or afford the high price of the black market. We certainly shouldn’t criminalize the quest for cognitive flourishing.

Nor should we compare the use of smart drugs and devices to the use of steroids in sports, an analogy that has led us very far astray. Life isn’t a competitive game with winners and losers and spectators on the sidelines. Brain improvement is not zero-sum. All of us stand to gain something from it.





The Misplaced Sports Analogy


By the year 2000, when she was twenty-four, everyone was talking about Marion Jones. In the three years since she’d become a full-time track athlete, she had dominated female track-and-field competitions so commandingly that most of her rivals were unknown. She had won thirty-three 100-meter races in a row, and all twenty-two of the 200-meter races she’d run. By the end of 1997, she was the world champion in the 100, and the next year she became the first woman in fifty years to win three individual events at the national championships. She’d won thrity-six out of thirty-seven sprints and jumps and was the second-fastest woman ever in the 100 and 200.38 When she set herself the goal of winning five medals at the Sydney Olympics, all eyes were on her.

And she did: three gold and two bronze. By the end of the year 2000, she had been named the fastest woman in the world. Her sponsors—from AT&T and TAG Heuer to Nike—all touted her as “the total package.”39 When asked to explain her success, she attributed it to “50 percent talent and 50 percent just wanting it so badly … I train harder than I think anybody else in the world in my sport.”40

Jones’s rock-star status stood her in good stead when her then-husband C. J. Hunter tested positive for steroids in the middle of the Sydney Olympic Games. And it helped sustain her popularity when she took a year off from sports in 2003 after announcing that she was having a child with her then-boyfriend and fellow sprinter Tim Montgomery. But then the US Anti-Doping Agency began probing Jones’s ties to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, which had been accused of distributing steroids to numerous top athletes. Jones’s boyfriend was charged with steroid use, and her ex-husband told federal officials that he had injected her with banned substances and seen her inject herself with them before, during, and after the Sydney Games.

By 2004, Jones’s performance had slipped notably. Many now suspected that the source of her success hadn’t been the 50 percent talent and 50 percent determination that she had touted, but her use (and likely abstinence when under scrutiny) of anabolic steroids. Jones vehemently denied it until October 2007, when she admitted in federal court that she had started using a designer steroid known as “the Clear” before the Sydney Games and had continued to use it until July 2001.41 Following her admission, the International Olympic Committee formally stripped her of her medals and wiped her name from the record books.42 Her fall from grace and from international fame was swift and complete.





What Makes Performance-Enhancing Drugs Count as Cheating in Sports?


Why was Jones’s loss of status unambiguous? And how do we know that using “the Clear” was cheating?

The World Anti-Doping Code, which was first adopted in 2004 and that seven hundred sports organizations around the world have now signed on to, provides the rationale for anti-doping in sports. Its purpose, it claims, is to preserve “the spirit of sport,” which it defines as “the pursuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of each person’s natural talents.” Since doping is unnatural, it is seen as fundamentally contrary to the spirit of sport, to the protection of athletes’ health, and to their “right to compete on a doping-free level playing field.”43

In other words, we ban certain substances from sport because as a society we have decided to define sport as about the celebration of natural talents, honed only through societally approved enhancements, and to protect the health of athletes by banning substances that pose risks to them. Games are self-enclosed systems; their rules and components define them. If it’s in the rules, it’s part of the game. If it is not, it isn’t! It’s just that simple.

Unlike other aspects of life, like attending school because of compulsory education laws, playing a game is entirely voluntary and cannot be forced upon a player. Anyone who plays a game voluntarily is bound to its rules. Typically, the goal of the game is for an individual or a team to win. There are preestablished conditions that must be met to do so.

There is no question that doping improves muscle strength and performance. Studies on the use of androgens show they can improve muscular strength by 5 to 20 percent, even when they are taken in much lower doses than athletes typically use.44 The enormous rewards for winners, the ever-increasing effectiveness of the drugs, and the fact that only 10 to 15 percent of athletes are randomly tested during major competitions create tremendous incentives for their use.

Of course, we could decide to define sports in some other way, such as a celebration of steroid-enhanced talent. In 1988, the television show Saturday Night Live ran a comedic riff on this very idea with “the first All-Drug Olympics,” in which athletes were not only allowed but encouraged to take all substances before, during, and after competitions. In this alternative world, 115 world records had already been shattered, as a Soviet weight lifter, Sergei Akmudov, who had ingested “anabolic steroids, Novocain, Nyquil, Darvon, and some sort of fish paralyzer” as well as “a few cocktails within the last hour” attempted to clean-and-jerk more than 1,500 pounds to triple the existing world record. Instead, his arms were pulled off his body and prop blood spurted everywhere.

But so far, we are sticking to the old approach. In the zero-sum games of sports there are clearly defined rules of participation.45 Deviate from them, and you are a cheater. Of course, reasonable people could disagree as to whether the “spirt of sport” privileges those who have won the genetic lottery over those who could achieve the same effects through ingesting or injecting other agents into their bodies. Consider the role of the hormone erythropoietin in sports performance.

The Finnish skier Eero Mäntyranta dominated the sport of cross-country skiing in the 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972 Olympics, winning seven medals in total. In his prime in 1964, he won the 15-kilometer event by 40.7 seconds, which is a margin of victory that no winner had accomplished before or since. As it turned out, Mäntyranta had a rare mutation in the gene that produces the receptor for the hormone erythropoietin (EPO).46 When oxygen levels in the tissues of the body drop, the kidneys produce EPO, which tell the bone marrow that it needs to manufacture more red blood cells. Once oxygen levels are stabilized, EPO production is shut down and red blood cell production returns to normal. But Mäntyranta’s genetic mutation turned off this feedback loop, so that his body continued to make extra red blood cells—as much as 40 to 50 percent more than the average individual. Some athletes have tried to mimic the same effect by training at high altitudes where there is less oxygen, conditioning their bodies to produce more EPO and hence more red blood cells. Others, such as the now-disgraced Lance Armstrong, took synthetically produced EPO to achieve the same effect. (Synthetic EPO has been banned since the early 1990s.)

So why was Mäntyranta celebrated as a star athlete and Lance Armstrong treated as a cheater? Because the rules we have set say that naturally occurring advantages are permissible whereas ingested, injected, or mechanical ones are not. A seven-foot-tall basketball player has an advantage over a shorter player, but the shorter player isn’t allowed to use stilts to compensate. As a society, we can choose to do this in a zero-sum setting like sports where what’s at stake—who wins or loses a game—is far less significant than what’s at stake in brain enhancements, which is individual and societal progress.

We’ve also made a societal decision that the protection of athletes’ health matters. When players at Princeton and Rutgers faced one another in the first college football game in 1869, neither team wore headgear. It wasn’t until 1893 that protective helmets came into use. As the rules of the game evolved to allow more player-to-player contact and tackling, the players’ equipment also evolved. And yet, it wasn’t until 1939 that helmets became a mandatory piece of equipment in college ball.47 Heightened concerns about head injuries today may cause changes not just in the gear that players wear but also the rules of the game.

This welfare-based concern has also been used to justify bans on drugs that are unsafe.48 The intake of anabolic steroids, for example, may increase the mass of the heart muscle, leading to a decrease in delivery of blood to the liver, raising the risks for both heart disease and liver failure. Taking excess EPO could increase the risk of blood clots and hence heart attacks and pulmonary embolisms. Gene therapy forms of doping can produce immune reactions that pose long- and short-term risks to athletes’ health. Drugs may also be banned to prevent players from being coerced into using them by their coaches, or by government entities in state-sponsored games.

By understanding these welfare-based concerns, we can also see why some enhancers are permitted. Caffeine and creatine supplements, for example, are allowed because they are generally viewed as safe, even though they do provide some competitive edge.





Mind Games


We may want to prohibit the use of cognitive enhancement when zero-sum games are played with our minds. When the World Chess Federation sought to have chess classified as an Olympic sport, they adopted a “cognitive doping” prohibition for tournament players for all the drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), many of which are stimulants with known beneficial effects on concentration, focus, and memory. When scientists studied over three thousand games played by forty chess players, they discovered that at least two drugs could substantially boost players’ scores: modafinil, by an average of 15 percent, and Ritalin, by 13 percent. Even caffeine, the most commonly used cognitive enhancer, improved performance by an average of 9 percent!49

This is why grandmaster Vassily Ivanchuk was found guilty of cognitive doping by the International Chess Federation after he refused to submit a urine sample for a drug test at the Chess Olympiad in Dresden in 2008. He was later exonerated, but only because he had not understood that the testing was mandatory.

Is it really cheating when chess players use cognitive-boosting drugs during tournaments? It is if the rules say that it is! The World Chess Federation and the International Chess Federation’s reason for banning these drugs was to bring them into compliance with IOC regulations, to have a shot at being classified as an Olympic sport. That IOC ban is in place to preserve the “spirit of sport” and to protect athletes against the health risks that certain drugs may pose.

But just because a game is zero-sum doesn’t mean that everyday competition should be treated similarly. Life is not a zero-sum game, and cognitive enhancement in everyday life stands to benefit everyone by lifting us up as a whole.





A Health Rationale in Life?


Laws, regulations, and norms have important purposes both in sports and in the larger society. Some are designed to nudge our behavior. Whether it’s helmet laws for motorcycle drivers, seat belt laws for cars, food labeling laws to guide our purchasing behavior, or speed limits to limit the number of automobile accidents, our society is full of measures that promote general welfare through regulations, particularly when the societal costs of doing otherwise are considered too high. But when they are used instead to interfere with purely self-regulating choices, society begins to encroach on individual liberties without sufficient justification to warrant doing so.

We weigh societal interests against individual liberty interests all the time. The individual interest at stake in cognitive enhancement is the right to decide if, when, and how we want to improve our brains to enable us to navigate life with additional capabilities and benefits. When what is at stake is so fundamental to what it means to be human, the rationale for society’s limitations of those choices must be quite convincing. If a cognitive enhancement led every person who used it to have uncontrollable fits of rage, we might rightly restrict access to that drug to protect others in society.

Athletics and chess are artificial, man-made systems. But life is not, and the right to self-determination over our brains and mental experiences in our everyday lives is much more important than any game.





Will the Pressure to Enhance Become Coercive?


One societal interest often advanced to justify banning or limiting the availability of cognitive enhancers is that their very existence creates both implicit and explicit pressure to join a “race to the top.” While we will explore the idea of explicit coercion in a later chapter on brain manipulation, let’s explore the idea of implicit coercion now.

Making cognitive enhancers available to individuals gives them a choice—the choice to enhance or not to enhance. This choice, which as we’ll explore in the next chapter is tantamount to our relative right to self-determination, is part of the “bundle of rights” that cognitive liberty protects. It’s true that a world in which enhancers are freely available may lead to their more widespread use, and that the more widespread their use, the more likely it is that people who choose not to enhance will fall behind. But this weaker claim of coercion doesn’t justify social limits on enhancement.50 We can and often do freely choose not to do something that makes us more competitive, choosing to take a vacation rather than working longer hours, spending time with friends instead of studying more for an exam—or gambling and doing things that can potentially make us less competitive, like eating a tasty dessert instead of a virtuous salad while training for a marathon.

Moreover, the idea that peer pressure would create coercion to take cognitive enhancers isn’t borne out by the evidence. Multiple studies have shown that individuals are no more willing to take cognitive enhancers when others do so, but they are more likely to avoid them when others disapprove of them.51 It isn’t the availability or even the use of cognitive enhancers by others per se that leads to coercive pressure. Rather, it’s when others perform better that pressure mounts to improve one’s own performance to remain competitive. Which, of course, can be said of many other endeavors.

Back in 1961, Kurt Vonnegut’s short story “Harrison Bergeron” envisioned a world in which no one was allowed to have an advantage over anyone else, whether “natural” or artificially induced:

The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren’t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General. So:

… It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn’t think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn’t think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains.…



To ban cognitive enhancements because of “implicit coercion” is to follow the same train of logic that leads to Vonnegut’s dystopian egalitarianism. The role of government should not be to make all our capabilities equal, but to enable us to flourish as individuals and as societies.

And while some may argue that each new potential source of inequality is one that we ought to prevent, a different approach would be to remove the barriers to cognitive enhancements by making them cheaper and more widely available. It may be better to try to lift humanity together rather than keep everyone similarly behind.





Is There a Duty to Disclose Enhancements?


While it may be morally and politically unjustified to limit access to cognitive enhancers without significant countervailing societal interests, should society nevertheless require certain individuals to disclose their use of them? Or the discontinuation of their use?

Consider, for example, the case of a physician who took cognitive enhancers throughout high school, college, medical school, and as she sat for her qualifying exams and board certifications. Once she begins her medical practice, she decides to stop taking them. Does she have a duty to inform her patients that she achieved her status as a physician with their help, but that she no longer uses them? Or is what it takes to get you through training different from what makes you a well-qualified doctor? Are her privacy interests outweighed by society’s interest in having an accurate representation of her capabilities? Should we apply a necessity and proportionality analysis to decide?

In the United States, few states require physicians to disclose specific information about themselves. But in some legal cases, courts have held that doctors have a legal duty to disclose their level of experience with a given technique when a reasonable person would expect to be told this information. In one case, a man named Alan Andersen underwent a Bentall heart procedure at the Iowa Heart Center. His physician, P. C. Khanna, did not have any experience or training in performing the procedure, and Andersen suffered serious side effects that ultimately caused him to need a heart transplant. Andersen sued, arguing that he had a right under informed consent laws to know the limits of Dr. Khanna’s experience.

The district court that initially heard Andersen’s claim found that a physician does not have a duty to disclose “physician-specific characteristics or experience in obtaining informed consent.” But the Iowa Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that if a reasonable person in the patient’s position would consider the information material to their decision about whether to undergo a treatment, a failure to disclose that information could breach the physician’s duty to that patient.52

Is prior use of cognitive enhancers material to whether a patient would choose to be treated by that physician? And if so, what other circumstances would raise the same duty of disclosure? Would a student who took cognitive enhancers when they sat for the SAT need to disclose that on their college applications? Must a lawyer, pharmacist, or other professional who used cognitive enhancers during their education disclose that to all their clients? 53

While our right to self-determination favors our choice to use cognitive enhancers, it isn’t an absolute human right like freedom of thought, which means society can impose limitations or duties upon us when it is necessary to do so for the greater good. Whether that is achieved through regulatory hurdles, to ensure that the drugs are safe and effective for use, or through duties of disclosure on individuals, the right to self-determination is a relative right that must be balanced against society’s interests as well.

We, as a society, will have to decide when we have a right to demand disclosure, and when individuals have a right to keep that information to themselves.

And as we will see in the next chapter, societal interests may be even stronger when it comes to braking or diminishing our brains instead.
