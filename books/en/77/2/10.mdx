title: 10 On Cognitive Liberty
---






When Shoshana Zuboff coined the concept of surveillance capitalism, our personal data had already been widely commodified and our ability to claw it back largely gone. With neurotechnology, it’s not too late to protect against that same fate for our brains. We stand at a fork in the road—where the coming dawn of neurotechnology could change our lives for the better or lead us to a more dystopian future where even our brains are hacked and tracked. The choice is still ours to make.

How do we choose the right path? By recognizing a new human right to cognitive liberty. Legal scholars Brandon Garrett, Laurence Helfer (also elected US representative to the UN Human Rights Committee), and Jayne Huckerby showed the way in a recent article proposing a new international human right to claim innocence after being convicted of a crime. Recognizing such a right, they argued, would have significant “symbolic, strategic, normative, and enforcement benefits.”1 It would have symbolic value by making a clear global norm; it would strategically empower social groups and mobilize them to further define its contours; it would change the default rules in favor of claims of actual innocence worldwide; and bring the right within an existing legal framework with enforcement mechanisms.2 Their approach shows why it’s important that we recognize a new human right to cognitive liberty, as well—and how doing so will enable us to update the human rights it impacts—the rights to privacy, freedom of thought, and self-determination over our brains and mental experiences.

Recognizing an international human right to cognitive liberty would make it a clear legal priority to protect our mental experiences as much as our other physical ones. Doing so would guide future conversations about the implementation of neurotechnology—whether used in healthcare, education, in the workplace, or by the military.3 As neurotechnology advances and governments and corporations can increasingly invade our brains, what we are feeling, and what we are thinking, this symbolic benefit can’t be overstated. John Stuart Mill argued in On Liberty that the “appropriate region of human liberty” comprised “the inward domain of consciousness.” But the world he lived in was not a world in which even our minds could be revealed. Now, our last fortress of privacy is in jeopardy. And our concept of liberty is in dire need of being updated.

Adopting a right to cognitive liberty would also shine a blinding light on the many reasons we will want to embrace neurotechnology, but also the grave risks of doing so without adequate protections in place for individuals. This would strengthen the growing social movements that are focused on minimizing the risks of neurotechnology by protecting the inner domain. And make clear countries’, corporations’, and individuals’ obligations to respect the cognitive rights of others, while creating a way to hold actors accountable if they violate those obligations.4

In some countries, international human rights law trumps any existing or conflicting laws so the right would go into effect immediately. Others would adopt laws to implement the right to cognitive liberty in specific contexts—regulating, for example, whether employers could use neurotechnology in the workplace and placing limitations on the brain wave data they collect. Existing structures and institutions in international law would also help to monitor violations of the right to cognitive liberty.

As Garrett, Helfer, and Huckerby describe it, the process of recognizing a new right involves “‘identifying previously unarticulated aspects of old human rights’ … or articulating ‘newly recognized aspects of existing rights.’”5 A new “General Comment” could be adopted to recognize the right to cognitive liberty and its relationship to the bundle of rights it encompasses—and define and elaborate on how it would apply in specific contexts. The rights it is derived from, and impacts, will also need to be updated to be consistent with a new right to cognitive liberty.

International human rights are meant to evolve over time, as circumstances in the world demand doing so. There are several ways that happens, such as through observations and recommendations written by governing bodies like the Human Rights Committee, judicial opinions in domestic cases, and revisions to existing General Comments that elaborate on how we should understand the meaning and scope of recognized rights.

Explicitly making mental privacy part of our existing right to privacy would shield our brains and mental processes from others in most instances, including identifying information from our brains, automatic processes, memories, and silent utterances in our minds. As a relative right, intrusions upon our mental privacy will be subject to the three-part test that is used in international law—legality, necessity, and proportionality. Is there a law that allows for encroaching on our mental privacy—such as a specific one that allows employers to monitor certain employees for fatigue? Is it necessary to do so to satisfy a compelling social interest like preventing mass fatalities from a trucking accident? Is the impact on the person’s rights proportionate to the societal interests being achieved? Are we intruding no more than necessary to protect the significant interests of others?

Freedom of thought, by contrast, is an absolute human right, and we will need to update our understanding of it to apply to contexts outside of religious freedom. Because of that, we must carefully interpret it to apply only to robust thought, like our memories and silent thinking and imagery, so we don’t make ordinary human interactions unlawful.

Without an individual right to self-determination, we cannot exercise our other human rights, so we must make explicit what has been an implicit right across the globe. That includes the right to informational self-determination to access information about ourselves, the right to choose how we will change our own brains and mental experiences, and the right to our capacity to choose by making it unlawful to disable or control a person’s mind. Although it is a relative right like mental privacy, because it is crucial to exercising our other rights, the tests of necessity and proportionality will rarely be met.

More benefits and risks will emerge as neurotechnology becomes part of our everyday lives and other rights may need to be updated to address them as they emerge. But we shouldn’t wait for those to arise before acting or we will miss the opportunity to choose the path forward for society.

We are past due on the urgent need to recognize the right to cognitive liberty over our brains and mental experiences. With prudent vigilance and democratic deliberation, we must continue the process of deciding how that liberty can and should evolve over time.
