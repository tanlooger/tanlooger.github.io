This book is the culmination of more than a decade of thinking, research, conversations, scholarship, presentations, and dialogue with others. I am grateful to the many people who have been involved and who have given me the support needed to make it possible. Even though they aren’t all mentioned here, each of them has had an important impact on my ideas and writing of this book.

A few played an outsized role in making the book happen. My literary agent, James Levine, has been by my side for nearly a decade in the development of this book. He helped to sharpen my ideas and writing and has been remarkably patient and generous with his time and insights. I am fortunate to have worked with my extraordinary and astute editor at St. Martin’s Press, Tim Bartlett, who believed in me and the importance of this book, and who has given me crucial feedback on the substance and writing. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Arthur Goldwag for his feedback, editorial assistance, ideas and additions to the book, and encouragement along the way. He helped me build my confidence in the writing process and ideas expressed in this book. Toby Lester gave me terrific early feedback about how to tackle this book and my writing of it. And Eliani Torres made numerous suggestions in the copyediting stage that improved the readability and clarity of my writing.

I am also grateful to my many friends and colleagues in neuroethics, law, and philosophy who have supported me with their comments, conversations, and cheerleading along the way. Hank Greely provided endless nudges, wise counsel, and encouragement to “get it done.” Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz helped to sharpen my thinking and offered invaluable insights at critical junctures. Alex Rosenberg and Glenn Cohen read earlier versions of chapters and helped me hone my message in them. Marin Levy and Rahaleh Nassri lent me their ears on more occasions than I should admit and gave me much-needed brain breaks to regain perspective. While many conversations over time have transformed my thinking on the topics in this book, some came at pivotal moments in the development of chapters, including those with Guy Charles, Esther Dyson, Linda Avey, Gavan Fitzsimmons, David Hoffman, Jolynn Dellinger, Emily Murphy, and Laurence Helfer. My colleagues at Duke Law and across the world, and audience members to whom I have presented these ideas asked wise and provocative questions and contributed in many ways big and small.

My research assistants, including Rachel Zacharias and Dylan Stonecipher, enabled me immensely. My assistant, Ava Lane, tirelessly rechecked and formatted the citations, and protected my time to finish writing the book. It takes a village, and our au pairs and nannies over the years have given me the time and pomodoros I needed to focus and write.

Throughout it all, my family—parents, Amir and Afsaneh Farahany, sisters Ava and Amanda, husband Thede, and living children Aristella and Alectra—have been patient, kind, supportive, and given me the much-needed levity, love, and support I needed to persevere. My sister Amanda read many early chapter drafts and provided me with enthusiasm and important feedback. My parents inspired my thinking and developments of many of the stories I used to share my thinking. Our late daughter, Callista, has reshaped my worldview. Her short life and memory have made me a more compassionate human being, and a much better ethicist.

Thanks to all.

Healthier employees are not only less expensive, but also significantly more productive. One study compared the productivity of employees at an industrial laundry company that offered an employee wellness program at 4 out of 5 of its locations. The sites that offered the wellness program enjoyed a 4 percent increase in worker productivity, or one additional productive workday per month per employee.

One study monitored the emails, management interactions, and productivity of men and women at work, found that men and women had nearly identical objective behaviors in the workplace. Which challenged a longstanding view that women received fewer promotions and lower wages due to their behavior or lesser productivity. Greater workplace equality could follow from what we learn.

Simon McCarthy-Jones, “The Autonomous Mind: The Right to Freedom of Thought in the Twenty-First Century,” Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence 2 (2019): 19, https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2019.00019; J. Cardozo, Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937) (Freedom of thought … is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of this truth can be traced in our history, political and legal.); see, for example, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969).



30. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnett, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).



31. The most common context in which freedom of thought has arisen in US law is when a criminal defendant challenges their conviction for an attempted but not completed crime. Take the sordid case of US v. Ganaches, 156 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998), which involved the attempted sexual assault of a minor in 1995. In that case, a police detective in Keene, New Hampshire, set up a sting operation to try to find and arrest would-be child molesters. Posing as the mother of young children who was seeking a male partner to engage in sex with them while she photographed them, the detective put an advertisement in a “swingers” magazine. The defendant responded to the advertisement and engaged in several months of correspondence. Finally, he traveled across state lines to New Hampshire, and waited in a motel parking lot for the mother and her three children to arrive. Instead, he was met by the detective and was arrested and ultimately convicted for the attempted sexual assault of a minor. In his appeal, the defendant argued that he was being punished for “mere thought” and not conduct, since he was arrested before he could carry out his intentions. The court considered his claim and agreed that freedom of thought protects individuals from being arrested and convicted of a crime for merely thinking about committing an illegal act. But he lost his appeal because he didn’t just “sit in the quiet of his house” while contemplating “evil thought.” Instead, he took substantial steps toward committing the crime and that was what he was being punished for.

16. Du et al., “Accident-Related Traumatic Brain Injuries.” Nearly every study on the issue, a systematic Cochrane review, and several meta-analyses show the utility of helmets in decreasing motorcycle-related injuries and deaths. One group of researchers looked at the eighteen different studies of the effectiveness of helmet legislation on motorcycle head injuries and fatalities and found that seventeen of eighteen studies found a positive association between mandatory helmet legislation and a reduction in motorcycle-related injuries or fatalities. Nine of the ten studies focused on the impact of helmet laws on head injuries found a substantial reduction in head injuries related to helmet legislation. And six of the eight studies focused on fatalities found that helmet legislation substantially reduced motorcycle-accident-related fatalities. Only one of the eighteen studies on the issue found no positive association between helmet legislation and reducing the number of injuries or fatalities resulting from motorcycle crashes.

Although ablation techniques are sometimes used in the United States to remove brain tumors, ablations of actual brain tissue are exceedingly rare. Only in cases of extreme neuropsychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and intractable depression, where traditional treatment has failed, is stereotactic ablation considered appropriate. Requests for the surgery must be approved by a multidisciplinary committee and are regularly rejected.
