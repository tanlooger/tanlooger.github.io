JOHNNY CELEBRATED HIS VOTING BIRTHDAY BY GETTING DRUNK FOR three days. When he was coming out of it, Katie locked him in the bedroom where he couldn’t get anything more to drink. Instead of sobering up, he started to get delirium tremens. He wept and begged by turns for a drink. He said he was suffering. She told him it was a good thing, that suffering would harden him, would teach him such a lesson that he’d stop drinking. But poor Johnny just wouldn’t harden. He softened into a wailing, screaming banshee.

Neighbors banged on her door and told her to do something for the poor man. Katie’s mouth set in a hard cold line and she called out to them to mind their own business. But even as she defied the neighbors, she knew that they would have to move as soon as the month was up. They couldn’t live in the neighborhood after the way Johnny was disgracing them.

In the late afternoon, his tortured cries unnerved Katie. Crowding the two babies in the buggy she went over to the factory and had Sissy’s long-suffering foreman get her away from her machine. She told Sissy about Johnny, and Sissy said she’d come over and fix him up as soon as she could get away.

Sissy consulted a gentleman friend about Johnny. The friend gave her instructions. Accordingly, she bought a half pint of good whiskey, concealed it between her full breasts and laced her corset cover and buttoned her dress over it.

She went over to Katie’s and told her that if she could be left alone with Johnny she’d get him out of it. Katie locked Sissy in the bedroom with Johnny. She went back into the kitchen and spent the night with her head on her arms on the table, waiting.

When Johnny saw Sissy, his poor mixed-up brain unscrambled for a minute and he grabbed her arm. “You’re my friend, Sissy. You’re my sister. For God’s sake give me a drink.”

“Take it slow, Johnny,” she said in her soft comforting voice. “I’ve got a drink right here for you.”

She unbuttoned her waist releasing a cascade of foaming white embroidered ruffles and dark pink ribbon. The room filled up with the sweet scent of the warm strong sachet she used. Johnny stared as she undid an intricate bow and loosened her corset cover. The poor fellow remembered her reputation and misunderstood.

“No, no, Sissy. Please!” he moaned.

“Don’t be a dockle, Johnny. There’s a time and a place for everything and this isn’t the time.” She pulled out the bottle.

He grabbed it. It was warm from her. She let him take a long drink, then she dug the bottle out of his clutching fingers. He quieted down after the drink; got sleepy and begged her not to go away. She promised. Without bothering to tie up her ribbons or button her waist, she lay on the bed beside him. She put her arm under his shoulders and he rested his cheek on her bare warm-scented breast. He slept and tears came from under his closed lids and they were warmer than the flesh they fell on.

She lay awake, holding him in her arms and staring into the darkness. She felt towards him as she would have felt towards her babies had they only lived to know her warm love. She stroked his curling hair and smoothed his cheek gently. When he moaned in his sleep, she soothed him with the kind of words she would have spoken to her babies. Her arm cramped and she tried to move it. He woke up for a moment, clutched her tightly and begged her not to leave him. When he spoke to her, he called her mother.

Whenever he woke up and got afraid, she gave him a swallow of whiskey. Towards morning he woke. His head was clearer but he said it hurt. He jerked away from her and moaned.

“Come back to Mama,” she said in her soft fluttering voice.

She opened her arms wide and once more he crept into them and rested his cheek on her generous breast. He wept quietly. He sobbed out his fears and his worries and his bewilderment at the way things were in the world. She let him talk, she let him weep. She held him the way his mother should have held him as a child (which she never did). Sometimes Sissy wept with him. When he had talked himself out, she gave him what was left of the whiskey and at last he fell into a deep exhausted sleep.

She lay very still for a long time not wanting him to feel her withdrawing from him. Towards dawn, his tight holding of her hand relaxed; peace came into his face and made it boyish again. Sissy put his head on the pillow, expertly undressed him and put him under the covers. She threw the empty whiskey bottle down the airshaft. She figured that what Katie didn’t know couldn’t possibly bother her. She tied her pink ribbons carelessly and adjusted her waist. She closed the door very softly when she went out.

Sissy had two great failings. She was a great lover and a great mother. She had so much of tenderness in her, so much of wanting to give of herself to whoever needed what she had, whether it was her money, her time, the clothes off her back, her pity, her understanding, her friendship or her companionship and love. She was mother to everything that came her way. She loved men, yes. She loved women too, and old people and especially children. How she loved children! She loved the down-and-outers. She wanted to make everybody happy. She had tried to seduce the good priest who heard her infrequent confessions because she felt sorry for him. She thought he was missing the greatest joy on earth by being committed to a life of celibacy.

She loved all the scratching curs on the street and wept for the gaunt scavenging cats who slunk around Brooklyn corners with their sides swollen looking for a hole in which they might bring forth their young. She loved the sooty sparrows and thought that the very grass that grew in the lots was beautiful. She picked bouquets of white clover in the lots believing they were the most beautiful flowers God ever made. Once she saw a mouse in her room. The next night she set out a tiny box for him with cheese crumbs in it. Yes, she listened to everybody’s troubles but no one listened to hers. But that was right because Sissy was a giver and never a taker.

When Sissy came into the kitchen, Katie looked at Sissy’s disordered clothing with swollen and suspicious eyes.

“I’m not forgetting,” she said with pitiful dignity, “that you are my sister. And I hope you remembered that, too.”

“Don’t be such a heimdickischer ass,” said Sissy, knowing what Katie meant. But she smiled deeply into Katie’s eyes. Katie was suddenly reassured.

“How’s Johnny?”

“Johnny will be fine when he wakes up. But for Christ’s sweet sake, don’t nag him when he wakes up. Don’t nag him, Katie.”

“But he’s got to be told….”

“If I hear that you nag him, I’ll get him away from you. I swear it. Even though I am your sister.”

Katie knew that she meant it and was a little frightened. “I won’t then,” she mumbled. “Not this time.”

“Now you’re growing up into a woman,” approved Sissy as she kissed Katie’s cheek. She felt sorry for Katie as well as for Johnny.

Katie broke down then and cried. She made hard ugly noises because she hated herself for crying, yet couldn’t help it. Sissy had to listen, to go through again all she had gone through with Johnny, only this time from Katie’s angle. Sissy handled Katie differently than she had handled Johnny. She had been gentle and maternal with Johnny because he needed that. Sissy acknowledged the steeliness that was in Katie. She hardened to that steeliness as Katie finished her story.

“And now you know it all, Sissy. Johnny’s a drunk.”

“Well, everybody’s something. We all got a tag of some kind. Take me, now: I never took a drink in my life. But do you know,” she stated with honest and consummate ignorance, “that there are some people who talk about me and call me a bad woman? Can you imagine that? I admit that I smoke a Sweet Caporal once in a while. But bad….”

“Well, Sissy, the way you carry on with men makes people…”

“Katie! Don’t nag! All of us are what we have to be and everyone lives the kind of life it’s in him to live. You’ve got a good man, Katie.”

“But he drinks.”

“And he always will until he dies. There it is. He drinks. You must take that along with the rest.”

“What rest? You mean the not working, the staying out all night, the bums he has for friends?”

“You married him. There was something about him that caught your heart. Hang on to that and forget the rest.”

“Sometimes, I don’t know why I married him.”

“You lie! You know why you married him. You married him because you wanted him to sleep with you but you were too religious to take a chance without a church wedding.”

“How you talk. The whole thing was that I wanted to get him away from someone else.”

“It was the sleeping. It always is. If it is good, the marriage is good. If it is bad, the marriage is bad.”

“No. There are other things.”

“What other things? Well, maybe there are,” conceded Sissy. “If there are other good things too, that’s so much velvet.”

“You’re wrong. That might be important to you, but…”

“It’s important to everybody or should be. Then all marriages would be happy.”

“Oh, I admit that I liked the way he danced, how he sang a song…the way he looked…”

“You’re saying what I’m saying but you’re using your own words.”

“How can you win out with a person like Sissy,” thought Katie. “She’s got everything figured out her way. Maybe her way is a good way to figure things out. I don’t know. She is my own sister but people talk about her. She is a bad girl and there is no getting around that. When she dies, her soul will wander through Purgatory through all eternity. I have often told her that and she always answers that it wouldn’t wander alone. If Sissy dies before I do, I must have masses said for the repose of her soul. Maybe after a while she’ll get out of Purgatory because even if they say she is bad, she is good to all the people in the world who are lucky enough to run across her. God will have to take that into consideration.”

Suddenly Katie leaned over and kissed Sissy on the cheek. Sissy was astonished because she could not know Katie’s thoughts.

“Maybe you’re right, Sissy, maybe you’re wrong. With me it comes down to this: Aside from his drinking, I love everything else about Johnny and I will try to be good to him. I will try to overlook…” She said no more. In her heart, Katie knew that she was not the overlooking kind.

Francie lay awake in the washbasket set up near the kitchen range. She lay sucking her thumb and listening to the conversation. But she learned nothing from it being but two years old at the time.
