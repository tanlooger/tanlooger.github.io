IT WAS THE FIRST TIME FRANCIE HAD SEEN MCSHANE WITHOUT HIS uniform. She decided that he looked very impressive in his expensively tailored double-breasted gray suit. Of course he wasn’t as good-looking as Papa had been; he was taller and more massive. But he was handsome in his own way, decided Francie, even though his hair was gray. But gosh, he was awful old for mother. True, mother wasn’t so young, either. She was going on thirty-five. Still that was much younger than fifty. Anyhow, no woman need be ashamed to have McShane for a husband. While he looked exactly what he was, a shrewd politician, his voice was gentle when he spoke.

They were having coffee and cake. With a pang, Francie noticed that McShane was sitting in her father’s place at the table. Katie had just finished telling him all that had happened since Johnny died. McShane seemed amazed at the progress they had made. He looked at Francie.

“So this slip of a girl got herself to college last summer!”

“And she’s going again this summer,” announced Katie proudly.

“There’s wonderful for you!”

“And she works in the bargain and earns twenty dollars a week now.”

“All that and good health, too?” he asked in honest amazement.

“The boy is halfway through high school.”

“No!”

“And he works at this and that afternoons and evenings. Sometimes he earns as much as five dollars a week outside of school.”

“A fine lad. One of the finest of lads. And look at the health of him—would you now.”

Francie wondered why he commented so much on the health which they themselves always took for granted. Then she remembered about his own children; how most of them had been born but to sicken and die before they grew up. No wonder he thought healthiness such a remarkable thing.

“And the baby?” he inquired.

“Go get her, Francie,” said Katie.

The baby was in her crib in the front room. It was supposed to be Francie’s room but all had agreed that the baby needed to sleep where there was air. Francie picked up the sleeping child. She opened her eyes and instantly was ready for anything.

“Bye-bye, Fran-nee? Park? Park?” she asked.

“No, sweet. Just an introduction to a man.”

“Man?” said Laurie doubtfully.

“Yes. A great big man.”

“Big man!” repeated the child happily.

Francie brought her out to the kitchen. The baby was truly a beautiful thing to see. She had a fresh dewy look in her pink flannel nightgown. Her hair was a mass of soft black curls. Her widely set apart dark eyes were luminous and there was a dusky rose color in her cheeks.

“Ah, the baby, the baby,” crooned McShane. “ ’Tis a rose she is. A wild rose.”

“If Papa were here,” thought Francie, “he’d start to sing, ‘My Wild Irish Rose.’” She heard her mother sigh and wondered whether she, too, was thinking….

McShane took the baby. The child sat on his knees, stiffened her back away from him and stared at him doubtfully. Katie hoped she wouldn’t cry.

“Laurie!” she said. “Mr. McShane. Say ‘Mr. McShane.’”

The child lowered her head, looked up through her lashes, smiled knowingly and shook her head, “no.”

“No may-mane,” she stated. “Man!” she shouted triumphantly. “Big man!” She smiled at McShane and said wheedlingly, “Take Laurie bye-bye? Park? Park?” Then she rested her cheek against his coat and closed her eyes.

“Aroon, aroon,” McShane crooned.

The child slept in his arms.

“Mrs. Nolan, you’re wonderin’ why I came tonight. Let your wonderin’ be over. I came to ask a personal question.” Francie and Neeley got up to leave. “No. Don’t be leavin,’ chilthern. The question would be concernin’ you as well as your mother.” They sat down again. He cleared his throat. “Mrs. Nolan, time has passed since your husband—God rest his soul….”

“Yes. Two and a half years. God rest his soul.”

“God rest his soul,” echoed Francie and Neeley.

“And my wife—’tis a year since she’s been gone, God rest her soul.”

“God rest her soul,” echoed the Nolans.

“I have been waitin’ many years and now the time has come when ’tis no longer disrespect to the dead to speak out.

“Katherine Nolan, I’m askin’ to keep company with you. Object, a weddin’ in the fall.”

Katie looked quickly at Francie and frowned. What was the matter with Mother anyhow? Francie wasn’t even thinking of laughing.

“I am in a position to take care of you and the three chilthern. With my pension and salary and income from real estate in Woodhaven and Richmond Hill, I have over ten thousand dollars a year. I have insurance, too. I offer to put the boy and girl through college and I promise to be a faithful husband in the future as I was in the past.”

“Have you thought this over, Mr. McShane?”

“I don’t need to be thinkin’. Sure didn’t I make up me mind five years ago when I saw you first at the Mahoney Outin’? ’Twas then I asked the girl if it was her mother you were.”

“I am a scrubwoman without education.” She stated it as a fact, not an apology.

“Education! And sure, who was it taught me to read and write? Nobody but meself.”

“But a man like you—in public life—needs a wife who knows social business—who can entertain his influential business friends. I’m not that kind of a woman.”

“My office is where I do my business entertainin’. My home is where I live. Now I’m not meanin’ you wouldn’t be a credit to me—you’d be a credit to a better man: But I’m needin’ no woman to help me out in my business. I can handle that meself, thank you. Need I be sayin’ I love you…” he hesitated before calling her by her first name “…Katherine? And is it time you want to think it over?”

“No. I don’t need time to think it over. I will marry you, Mr. McShane.

“Not for your income. Although I’m not overlooking that. Ten thousand a year’s a lot of money. But so is one thousand to people like us. We’ve had little money and are well trained in doing without it. It’s not for sending the children to college. Your help will make it so easy. But without help at all, I knew we’d manage some way. It’s not for your grand public position although it’ll be fine to have a husband to be proud of.

“I will marry you because you are a good man and I’d like to have you for my husband.”

It was true. Katie had made up her mind to marry him—if he asked her—simply because life was incomplete without a man to love her. It had nothing to do with her love for Johnny. She’d always love him. Her feeling for McShane was quieter. She admired and respected him and she knew she’d be a good wife to him.

“Thank you, Katherine. Sure it’s little enough I’m givin’ in exchange for a pretty young wife and three healthy chilthern,” he said in sincere humility.

He turned to Francie. “As the eldest, do you be approvin’?”

Francie looked at her mother who seemed to be waiting for her to speak. She looked at her brother. He nodded.

“I think my brother and I would like to have you for a….” Tears came into her eyes as she thought of her father and she couldn’t say that next word.

“Now, now,” said McShane soothingly, “I’ll not have you worryin’.” He turned to Katie.

“I’m not askin’ that the two oldest call me ‘father.’ They had a father and he as fine a lad as God ever made—the way he was always singin’.”

Francie felt her throat tightening.

“And I won’t be askin’ that they take my name—Nolan bein’ the fine name it is.

“But this little one I’m holdin’—the one who never looked on a father’s face: Would you be lettin’ her call me father, and lettin’ me legally adopt her and give her the name that you and I will be carryin’ together?”

Katie looked at Francie and Neeley. How would they take it—their sister called McShane instead of Nolan? Francie nodded approval. Neeley nodded approval.

“We will give you the child,” said Katie.

“We can’t call you ‘Father,’” said Neeley suddenly. “But we’ll call you ‘Dad,’ maybe.”

“I’m thankin’ you,” said McShane simply. He relaxed and smiled at them. “Now I’m wonderin’ if I could smoke me pipe?”

“Why, you could have smoked anytime without asking,” said Katie in surprise.

“I didn’t want to be takin’ privileges before I was entitled to them,” he explained.

Francie took the sleeping baby from him in order to let him smoke.

“Help me put her to bed, Neeley.”

“Why?” Neeley was thoroughly enjoying himself and didn’t want to leave.

“To fix the blankets in the crib. Somebody’s got to do it while I hold her.” Didn’t Neeley know anything? Didn’t he know that maybe McShane and mother wanted to be alone for a minute, at least?

In the darkness of the front room, Francie whispered to her brother, “What do you think of it?”

“It’s sure a good break for Mama. Of course he isn’t Papa….”

“No. No one will ever be…Papa. But aside from that, he’s a nice man, though.”

“Laurie’s going to have a mighty easy life all right.”

“Annie Laurie McShane! She’ll never have the hard times we had, will she?”

“No. And she’ll never have the fun we had, either.”

“Gosh! We did have fun, didn’t we, Neeley?”

“Yeah!”

“Poor Laurie,” said Francie pityingly.
