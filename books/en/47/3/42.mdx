FRANCIE HARDLY HAD TIME TO GET USED TO LAURIE WHEN GRADUATION night came around. Katie couldn’t go to both graduations so it was decided that she go to Neeley’s. And that was right. Neeley shouldn’t be deprived because Francie had felt like changing schools. Francie understood but felt a bit hurt just the same. Papa would have gone to see her graduate if he were living. They arranged that Sissy go with Francie. Evy would stay with Laurie.

On the last night in June 1916, Francie walked for the last time to the school she so loved. Sissy, quiet and changed since she got her baby, walked sedately beside her. Two firemen passed and Sissy never so much as noticed and there had been a time when Sissy couldn’t resist a uniform. Francie wished Sissy hadn’t changed. It made her feel lonesome. Her hand crept into Sissy’s and Sissy squeezed it. Francie was comforted. Sissy was still Sissy underneath.

The graduates sat in the front part of the auditorium and the guests in the back. The principal made an earnest speech to the children about how they were going out into a troubled world and about how it would be up to them to build a new world after the war which was sure to come to America. He urged them on to higher education so that they would be better equipped for this world building. Francie was impressed and vowed in her heart that she’d help carry the torch like he said.

Then came the graduation play. Francie’s eyes burned with unshed tears. As the diluted dialogue droned on, she thought, “My play would have been better. I would have taken the ash can out. I would have done whatever Teacher said if she had only let me write the play.”

After the play, they marched up, got their diplomas and were graduates at last. The oath of allegiance to the flag and the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” clinched it.

And now came the time of Francie’s Gethsemane.

It was the custom to present bouquets to the girl graduates. Since flowers were not allowed in the auditorium, they were delivered to the classrooms where the teachers placed them on the recipient’s desk.

Francie had to go back to her room to get her report card; also her pencil box and autograph book from her desk. She stood outside nerving herself for the ordeal, knowing her desk would be the only one without flowers. She was sure, because she hadn’t told Mama about the custom, knowing there was no money at home for such things.

Deciding to get it over with, she went in and walked straight to the teacher’s desk, not daring to look at her own. The air was thick with flower scents. She heard the girls chattering and squealing with delight over their flowers. She heard the exchange of triumphant admiration.

She got her report card: four “A”s and one “C minus.” The latter was her English mark. She used to be the best writer in school and here she ended up barely passing English. Suddenly, she hated the school and all the teachers, especially Miss Garnder. And she didn’t care about not getting flowers. She didn’t care. It was a silly custom, anyway. “I’ll go to my desk and get my things,” she decided. “And if anyone speaks to me, I’ll tell them to shut up. And then I’ll walk out of this school forever and not say good-bye to anyone.” She raised her eyes. “The desk without flowers on it will be mine.” But there were no empty desks! There were flowers on every single one!

Francie went to her desk, reasoning that a girl had placed one of her bouquets there for a moment. Francie planned to pick it up and hand it to the owner saying coolly, “Do you mind? I have to get something out of my desk.”

She picked up the flowers—two dozen dark red roses on a sheaf of ferns. She cradled them in her arm, the way the other girls did, and pretended for a moment that they were hers. She looked for the owner’s name on the card. But her own name was on the card! Her name! The card said: For Francie on graduation day. Love from Papa.

Papa!

The writing was in his fine careful hand, in the black ink from the bottle in the cupboard at home. Then it was all a dream, a long mixed-up dream. Laurie was a dream, and the working at McGarrity’s, and the graduation play, and the bad mark in English. She was waking up now and everything would be all right. Papa would be waiting out in the hall.

But there was only Sissy in the hall.

“Then Papa is dead,” she said.

“Yes,” said Sissy. “And it’s six months now.”

“But he can’t be, Aunt Sissy. He sent me flowers.”

“Francie, about a year ago he gave me that card all written out and two dollars. He said, ‘When Francie graduates, send her some flowers for me—in case I forget.’”

Francie started to cry. It wasn’t only because she was sure, now, that nothing was a dream; it was because she was unstrung from working too hard and worrying about Mama; because she didn’t get to write the graduation play; because she got a bad mark in English; because she had been too well prepared not to receive flowers.

Sissy took her to the girls’ washroom and pushed her into a booth. “Cry loud and hard,” she ordered, “and hurry up. Your mother will be wondering what’s keeping us.”

Francie stood in the booth, clutching her roses and sobbing. Each time the washroom door opened and chattering announced incoming girls, she flushed the toilet so that the noise of the water would drown out her sobs. Soon she was over it. When she came out, Sissy had a handkerchief wet with cold water to hand her. As Francie mopped her eyes, Sissy asked whether she felt better. Francie nodded yes, and begged her to wait a moment while she said her good-byes.

She went into the principal’s office and shook hands with him. “Don’t forget the old school, Frances. Come back and see us sometime,” he said.

“I will,” promised Francie. She went back to say good-bye to her classroom teacher.

“We’ll miss you, Frances,” said Teacher.

Francie got her pencil box and autograph book from her desk. She started to say good-bye to the girls. They crowded around her. One put her arm around her waist and two others kissed her cheek. They called out good-bye messages.

“Come to my house to see me, Frances.”

“Write to me, Frances, and let me know how you’re getting along.”

“Frances, we have a telephone now. Ring me up sometime. Ring me up tomorrow.”

“Write something in my autograph book, huh, Frances? So’s I can sell it when you get famous.”

“I’m going to summer camp. I’ll put down my address. Write to me. Hear, Frances?”

“I’m going to Girls High in September. You come to Girls High, too, Frances.”

“No. Come to Eastern District High with me.”

“Girls High!”

“Eastern District!”

“Erasmus Hall High’s the best. You come there, Frances, with me and we’ll be friends all through high school. I’ll never have any other friend but you, if you’ll come.”

“Frances, you never let me write in your autograph book.”

“Me neither.”

“Gimme, gimme.”

They wrote in Francie’s all but empty book. “They’re nice,” Francie thought. “I could have been friends with them all the time. I thought they didn’t want to be friends. It must have been me that was wrong.”

They wrote in the book. Some wrote small and cramped; others, loose and sprawling. But all the writing was the handwriting of children. Francie read as they wrote:

I wish you luck, I wish you joy.

I wish you first, a baby boy.

And when his hair begins to curl,

I wish you then, a baby girl.

Florence Fitzgerald.



When you are married

And your husband gets cross,

Sock him with the poker,

And get a divorce.

Jeannie Leigh.



When night draws back the curtain,

And pins it with a star,

Remember I am still your friend,

Though you may wander far.

Noreen O’Leary.



Beatrice Williams turned to the last page in the book and wrote:

Way back here and out of sight,

I sign my name, just for spite.



She signed it, Your Fellow Writer, Beatrice Williams. “She would say fellow writer,” thought Francie, still jealous about the play.

Francie got away at last. Out in the hall she said to Sissy, “Just one more good-bye.”

“It’s taking you the longest time to graduate,” protested Sissy good-naturedly.

Miss Garnder sat at her desk in her brilliantly lighted room. She was alone. She wasn’t popular and so far no one had been in to say good-bye. She looked up eagerly as Francie entered.

“So you’ve come to say good-bye to your old English teacher,” she said, pleased.

“Yes, ma’am.”

Miss Garnder couldn’t let it go at that. She had to be a teacher. “About your mark: You haven’t turned in work this term. I should have failed you. But at the last moment, I decided to pass you so that you could graduate with your class.” She waited. Francie said nothing. “Well? Aren’t you going to thank me?”

“Thank you, Miss Garnder.”

“You remember our little chat?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Why did you turn stubborn and stop handing in work, then?”

Francie had nothing to say. It was something she couldn’t explain to Miss Garnder. She held out her hand. “Good-bye, Miss Garnder.”

Miss Garnder was taken aback. “Well—good-bye, then,” she said. They shook hands. “In time to come, you’ll see I was right, Frances.” Francie said nothing. “Won’t you?” Miss Garnder asked sharply.

“Yes, ma’am.”

Francie went out of the room. She did not hate Miss Garnder anymore. She didn’t like her, but she felt sorry for her. Miss Garnder had nothing in all the world excepting a sureness about how right she was.

Mr. Jenson stood on the school steps. He took each child’s hand in both of his and said, “Good-bye and God bless you.” He added a personal message for Francie. “Be good, work hard, and reflect credit on our school.” Francie promised that she would.

On the way home, Sissy said, “Look! Let’s not tell your mother who sent the flowers. It will start her to remembering and she’s just about getting well after Laurie.” They agreed to say that Sissy bought the flowers. Francie removed the card and put it in her pencil box.

When they told Mama the lie about the flowers, she said, “Sissy, you shouldn’t have spent your money.” But Francie could tell that Mama was pleased.

The two diplomas were admired and everyone agreed that Francie’s was the prettiest on account of Mr. Jenson’s fine handwriting.

“The first diplomas in the Nolan family,” said Katie.

“But not the last, I hope,” said Sissy.

“I’m going to see to it that each of my children have three,” said Evy, “grade school, high school and college.”

“In twenty-five years,” said Sissy, “our family will have a stack of diplomas this high.” She stood on tiptoe and measured six feet from the ground.

Mama examined the report cards for the last time. Neeley had “B” in conduct, the same in physical education and “C” in all his other subjects. Mama said, “That’s good, son.” She looked past Francie’s “A”s and concentrated on the “C minus.”

“Francie! I’m surprised. How did this happen?”

“Mama, I don’t want to talk about it.”

“And in English, too. Your best subject.”

Francie’s voice notched up higher as she repeated, “Mama, I don’t want to talk about it.”

“She always wrote the best compositions in school,” explained Katie to her sisters.

“Mama!” It was almost a scream.

“Katie! Stop it!” ordered Sissy sharply.

“All right, then,” surrendered Katie, suddenly aware that she was nagging and ashamed of herself.

Evy jumped in with a change of subject. “Do we have that party, or don’t we?” she asked.

“I’m putting my hat on,” Katie said.

Sissy stayed with Laurie while Evy, Mama, and the two graduates went to Scheefly’s Ice-Cream Saloon for the party. Scheefly’s was crowded with graduation parties. The kids had their diplomas with them and the girls brought their bouquets. There was a mother or a father—sometimes both, at each table. The Nolan party found a free table at the back of the room.

The place was a medley of shouting kids, beaming parents and rushed waiters. Some kids were thirteen, a few fifteen, but most of them Francie’s age—fourteen. Most of the boys were Neeley’s classmates and he had a great time hollering greetings across the room. Francie hardly knew the girls, nevertheless she waved and called out to them as gaily as though they had been close friends for years.

Francie was proud of Mama. The other mothers had graying hair and most of them were so fat that their backsides slopped over the edges of the chair. Mama was slender and didn’t look at all like going on thirty-three. Her skin was as smoothly clear and her hair as black and curling as it had ever been. “Put her in a white dress,” thought Francie, “with a bunch of roses in her arms, and she’d look like any fourteen-year-old graduate—except for the line between her eyes that cut deeper since Papa died.”

They ordered. Francie had a mental list of all the soda flavors. She was going down the list so that she could say she had tasted all the kinds of sodas in the world. Pineapple was next and she ordered that. Neeley ordered the old standby, chocolate soda, and Katie and Evy chose plain vanilla ice cream.

Evy made up little stories about the people in the place and kept Francie and Neeley laughing. Francie studied her mother from time to time. Mama wasn’t smiling at Evy’s jokes. She ate her ice cream slowly and the line between her eyes deepened and Francie knew that she was figuring something out.

“My children,” thought Katie, “have more education at thirteen and fourteen than I have at thirty-two. And still it isn’t enough. When I think of how ignorant I was at their age. Yes, and even when I was married and had a baby. Imagine. I believed in witch’s charms, then—what the midwife told me about the woman in the fish market. They started in way ahead of me. They were never that ignorant.

“I got them graduated from grade school. I can’t do more for them. All my plans…Neeley, a doctor, Francie in college…can’t work them out now. The baby…. Have they enough in them to get somewhere alone? I don’t know. The Shakespeare…the Bible…. They know how to play piano but they’ve stopped practicing now. I taught them to be clean and truthful and not to take charity. Is that enough, though?

“They’ll have a boss to please, soon, and new people to get along with. They’ll get into other ways. Good? Bad? They won’t sit home with me nights if they work all day. Neeley will be off with his friends. And Francie? Reading…. Away to the library…a show…a free lecture or band concert. Of course, I’ll have the baby. The baby. She’ll get a better start. When she graduates, the other two might see her through high school. I must do better for Laurie than I did for them. They never had enough to eat, never had right clothes. The best I could do wasn’t enough. And now they have to go out to work and they’re still little children. Oh, if I could only get them into high school this fall! Please God! I’ll give twenty years off my life. I’ll work night and day. But I can’t, of course. No one to stay with the baby.”

Her thoughts were broken into by a wave of singing that rolled over the room. Someone started a popular anti-war song and the rest took it up.

I didn’t raise my boy to be a soldier.*

I brought him up to be my pride and joy…



Katie resumed her thoughts. “There is no one to help us. No one.” She thought briefly of Sergeant McShane. He had sent a big basket of fruit when Laurie was born. She knew he was retiring from the police force in September. He was going to run for Assemblyman from Queens, his home borough, next Election. Everyone said he’d be sure to get in. She had heard that his wife was very sick, might not live to see her husband elected.

“He’ll marry again,” thought Katie. “Of course. Some woman who knows all about social life…help him…the way a politician’s wife must.” She stared at her workworn hands for a long time, then put them under the table as though she were ashamed of them.

Francie noticed. “She’s thinking of Sergeant McShane,” she guessed, remembering how Mama had put on her cotton gloves that time long ago at the outing when McShane had looked at her. “He likes her,” thought Francie. “I wonder does she know it? She must. She seems to know everything. I bet she could marry him if she wanted to. But he needn’t think I’d ever call him father. My father is dead and no matter who Mama marries, he will only be Mr. So-and-So to me.”

They were finishing the song.

There’d be no wars today,

If mothers all would say,

I didn’t raise my boy to be a soldier.



“…Neeley,” thought Katie. “Thirteen. If war does come here, it will be over before he gets old enough to go, thank God.”

Now Aunt Evy was singing softly to them, making up a parody on the song.

Who dares to place a mustache on his shoulder.



“Aunt Evy, you’re terrible,” said Francie as she and Neeley screamed with laughter. Katie jerked out of her thoughts and looked up and smiled. Then the waiter laid down the check and they all grew silent, watching Katie.

“I hope she’s not fool enough to tip him,” thought Evy.

“Does Mama know you’re supposed to leave a nickel tip?” thought Neeley. “I hope so.”

“Whatever Mama does,” thought Francie, “it will be the right thing.”

It wasn’t the custom to tip in the ice-cream saloons except on special parties when you were supposed to leave a nickel. Katie saw that the check was for thirty cents. She had one coin in her old purse, it was a fifty-cent piece which she laid on the check. The waiter took it away and brought back four nickels which he laid in a row. He hovered nearby waiting for Katie to pick up three of them. She looked at the four nickels. “Four loaves of bread,” she thought. Four pair of eyes watched Katie’s hand. Katie never hesitated once she put her hand on the money. With a sure gesture, she pushed the four nickels toward the waiter.

“Keep the change,” she said grandly.

Francie had all she could do not to stand up on her chair and cheer. “Mama is somebody,” she kept saying to herself. The waiter scooped up the nickels happily and rushed away.

“Two sodas shot,” groaned Neeley.

“Katie, Katie, how foolish,” protested Evy. “I bet it’s your last money, too.”

“It is. But it may be our last graduation, too.”

“McGarrity pays us four dollars tomorrow,” said Francie, defending her mother.

“And he fires us tomorrow too,” added Neeley.

“There’ll be no money after that four dollars until they get jobs, then,” concluded Evy.

“I don’t care,” said Katie. “For once I wanted us to feel like millionaires. And if twenty cents can make us feel rich, it’s a cheap price to pay.”

Evy recalled how Katie let Francie pour her coffee down the sink and said nothing more. There were many things she didn’t understand about her sister.

The parties were breaking up. Albie Seedmore, the leggy son of a prosperous grocer, came over to their table.

“Go-to-the-movies-with-me-tomorrow-Francie?” he asked all on a breath. “I’ll pay,” he added hastily.

(A movie house was letting the graduates attend the Saturday matinee two-for-a-nickel providing they brought their diplomas along as proof.)

Francie looked at her mother. Mama nodded her consent.

“Sure, Albie,” accepted Francie.

“See you. Two. Tomorrow.” He loped off.

“Your first date,” said Evy. “Make a wish.” She held out her little finger and crooked it. Francie hooked her little finger into Aunt Evy’s.

“I wish I could always wear a white dress and carry red roses and that we could always throw money around like we did tonight,” wished Francie.
