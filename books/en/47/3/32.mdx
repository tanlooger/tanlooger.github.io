FRANCIE HAD STARTED A DIARY ON HER THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY WITH the entry:

Dec. 15. Today I enter my teens. What will the year bring forth? I wonder.



The year brought forth little according to the entries which became sparser as the year wore on. She had been prompted to start a diary because fictional heroines kept them and filled them with lush sighing thoughts. Francie thought her diary would be like that, but excepting for some romantic observations on Harold Clarence, actor, the entries were prosaic. Towards the end of the year she riffled through the pages reading an item here and there.

Jan. 8. Granma Mary Rommely has a pretty carved box that her great-grandfather made in Austria over a hundred years ago. She has a black dress and white petticoat and shoes and stockings in it. They are her burying clothes as she doesn’t want to be buried in a shroud. Uncle Willie Flittman said he wants to be cremated and his ashes scattered from the Statue of Liberty. He thinks he’ll be a bird in the next life and he wants a good start. Aunt Evy said he’s a bird already, a cuckoo. Mama scolded me for laughing. Is cremation better than burying? I wonder.

Jan. 10. Papa sick today.

March 21. Neeley stole pussy willows from McCarren’s Park and gave them to Gretchen Hahn. Mama said he’s too young to be thinking about girls. There’s time enough, she said.

April 2. Papa hasn’t worked for three weeks. There’s something wrong with his hands. They shake so much he can’t hold anything.

April 20. Aunt Sissy says she’s going to have a baby. I don’t believe it because she’s flat in front. I heard her tell Mama she’s carrying it in the back. I wonder.

May 8. Papa sick today.

May 9. Papa went to work tonight but had to come home. Said the people didn’t need him.

May 10. Papa sick. Had bad nightmares in the daytime and screamed. I had to get Aunt Sissy.

May 12. Papa hasn’t worked for over a month. Neeley wants to get his working papers and leave school. Mama said no.

May 15. Papa worked tonight. He said he’s going to take charge of things from now on. He scolded Neeley about the working papers.

May 17. Papa came home sick. Some kids were following him on the street and making fun of him. I hate kids.

May 20. Neeley has a paper route now. He won’t let me help sell papers.

May 28. Carney did not pinch my cheek today. He pinched something else. I guess I’m getting too big to sell junk.

May 30. Miss Garnder said they are going to publish my winter time composition in the magazine.

June 2. Papa came home sick today. Neeley and I had to help Mama get him upstairs. Papa cried.

June 4. I got A on my composition today. We had to write on My Ambition. I only made one mistake. I wrote play-writer and Miss Garnder said the right word was playwright.

June 7. Two men brought Papa home today. He was sick. Mama was away. I put Papa to bed and gave him black coffee. When Mama came home she said that was the right thing to do.

June 12. Miss Tynmore gave me Schubert’s Serenade today. Mama’s ahead of me. She got Tannhauser’s Evening Star. Neeley says he’s ahead of both of us. He can play Alexander’s Ragtime Band without notes.

June 20. Went to show. Saw The Girl of the Golden West. It was the best show I ever saw, the way the blood dripped through the ceiling.

June 21. Papa was away for two nights. We didn’t know where he was. He came home sick.

June 22. Mama turned my mattress today and found my diary and read it. Everywhere I had the word drunk, she made me cross it out and write sick. It’s lucky I didn’t have anything against Mama written down. If ever I have children I will not read their diaries as I believe that even a child is entitled to some privacy. If Mama finds this again and reads it, I hope she will take the hint.

June 23. Neeley says he has a girl. Mama says he’s too young. I wonder.

June 25. Uncle Willie, Aunt Evy, Sissy and her John over tonight. Uncle Willie drank a lot of beer and cried. He said the new horse he’s got, Bessie, did worse than wet on him. Mama scolded me for laughing.

June 27. We finished the Bible today. Now we got to start all over. We’ve gone through Shakespeare four times already.

July 1. Intolerance….



Francie put her hand over the entry to hide the words. For a moment, she thought the waves would pass over her again. But the feeling went away. She turned the page and read another entry.

July 4. Sergeant McShane brought Papa home today. Papa wasn’t arrested as we thought at first. He was sick. Mr. McShane gave Neeley and me a quarter. Mama made us give it back.

July 5. Papa still sick. Will he ever work again? I wonder.

July 6. We started playing the North Pole game today.

July 7. North Pole.

July 8. North Pole.

July 9. North Pole. Expected rescue did not come.

July 10. We opened the tin-can bank today. There was eight dollars and twenty cents in it. My golden pennies had turned black.

July 20. All the money from the tin-can bank is gone. Mama took some washing to do for Mrs. McGarrity. I helped iron but burnt a hole on Mrs. McGarrity’s drawers. Mama won’t let me iron anymore.

July 23. I got a job at Hendler’s Restaurant just for the summer. I wash dishes during the dinner and supper rush. I use gobs of soft soap out of a barrel. On Monday a man comes and collects three barrels of scraps of fat and brings back one barrel of soft soap on Wednesday. Nothing is wasted in this world. I get two dollars a week and my meals. It isn’t hard work but I don’t like that soap.

July 24. Mama said I’d be a woman before I knew it. I wonder.

July 28. Floss Gaddis and Frank are going to be married as soon as he gets a raise. Frank says that the way President Wilson is running things we’ll be in the war before you know it. He says he’s marrying because he wants a wife and kids so that when war comes he doesn’t have to fight. Flossie says that’s not true; it’s a case of true love. I wonder. I remember how Flossie used to chase him years ago when he was washing the horse.

July 29. Papa wasn’t sick today. He’s going to get a job. He said Mama has to stop washing for Mrs. McGarrity and I have to give up my job. He says we’ll be rich and all go to live in the country. I wonder.

Aug. 10. Sissy says she’s going to have a baby soon. I wonder. She’s as flat as a pancake.

Aug. 17. Papa has been working for three weeks now. We have wonderful suppers.

Aug. 18. Papa’s sick.

Aug. 19. Papa’s sick because he lost his job. Mr. Hendler won’t take me back in the restaurant. He says I’m not reliable.

Sept. 1. Aunt Evy, Uncle Willie over tonight. Willie sang Frankie and Johnny and put dirty words in it. Aunt Evy stood on a chair and punched him in the nose. Mama scolded me for laughing.

Sept. 10. I started my last year of school. Miss Garnder said if I keep on getting A’s on my composition, she might let me write a play for graduation. I have a very beautiful idea. There will be a girl in a white dress and her hair hanging down her back and she will be Fate. Other girls will come out on the stage and tell what they want from Life and Fate will tell them what they’ll get. At the end a girl in a blue dress will spread out her arms and say, “Is life worth living then?” And there will be a chorus that says “yes.” Only it will all be in rhyme. I told Papa about it but he was too sick to understand. Poor Papa.

Sept. 18. I asked Mama could I get a Castle Clip and she said no that hair was a woman’s crowning beauty. Does that mean she expects me to be a woman soon? I hope so because I want to be my own boss and get my hair cut off if I feel like it.

Sept. 24. Tonight when I took a bath, I discovered that I was changing into a woman. It’s about time.

Oct. 25. I will be glad when this book is filled up as I am getting tired of keeping a diary. Nothing important ever happens.



Francie came to the last entry. Only one more blank page left. Well, the sooner she got it filled, the sooner the diary-keeping would be over and she wouldn’t have to bother with it anymore. She wet her pencil.

Nov. 2. Sex is something that invariably comes into everyone’s life. People write pieces against it. The priests preach against it. They even make laws against it. But it keeps going on just the same. All the girls in school have but the one topic of conversation: sex and boys. They are very curious about it. Am I curious about sex?



She studied the last sentence. The line on the inner edge of her right eyebrow deepened. She crossed out the sentence and rewrote it to read: “I am curious about sex.”
