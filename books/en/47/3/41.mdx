LAURIE WAS A GOOD BABY. SHE SLEPT CONTENTEDLY MOST OF THE time. When she was awake, she put in the time lying quietly and trying to focus her berry brown eyes on her infinitesimal fist.

Katie nursed the baby, not only because it was the instinctive thing to do, but because there was no money for fresh milk. Since the baby couldn’t be left alone, Katie started her work at five in the morning, doing the other two houses first. She worked until nearly nine when Francie and Neeley left for school. Then she cleaned her own house leaving the door of her flat ajar in case Laurie cried. Katie went to bed immediately after supper each night and Francie saw so little of her mother that it seemed as if Mama had gone away.

McGarrity didn’t fire them after the baby’s birth as he had planned. He really needed them now because his business boomed suddenly in that spring of 1916. His saloon was crowded all the time. Great changes were taking place in the country, and his customers, like Americans everywhere, had to get together to talk things over. The corner saloon was their only gathering place, the poor man’s club.

Francie, working in the flat above the saloon, heard their raised voices through the thin floor boards. Often she paused in her work and listened. Yes, the world was changing rapidly and this time she knew it was the world and not herself. She heard the world changing as she listened to the voices.

It’s a fact. They’re gonna stop making liquor and in a few years the country will be dry.

A man that works hard has a right to his beer.

Tell that to the president and see how far you get.

This is a people’s country. If we don’t want it dry, it won’t be dry.

Sure it’s a people’s country but they’re gonna push prohibition down your throat.

By Jesus, I’ll make my own wine, then. My old man used to make it in the old country. You take a bushel of grapes….

G’wan! They’ll never give wimmen the vote.

Don’t lay any bets on it.

If that comes, my wife votes like I do, otherwise I’ll break her neck.

My old woman wouldn’t go to the polls and mix in with a bunch of bums and rummies.

…a woman president. That might be.

They’ll never let a woman run the government.

There’s one running it right now.

Like hell!

Wilson can’t turn around and go to the bathroom ’less he asks Mrs. Wilson if it’s okay by her.

Wilson’s an old woman himself.

He’s keeping us out of war.

That college professor!

What we need in the White House is a sound politician and not a schoolteacher.

* * *

…automobiles. Soon the horse will be a thing of the past. That feller out in Dee-troit’s making cars so cheap that soon every working man can have one.

A laborer driving his own car! You should live so long!

Airplanes! Just a crazy fad. Won’t last long.

The moving pitchers is here to stay. The thee-ayters is closing up one by one in Brooklyn. Take me: I’d rather see this here Charlie Chaplin any day than this here Corset Payton the wife goes for.

…wireless. Greatest thing ever invented. Words come through the air, mind you, without wires. You need a kind of a machine to ketch it and earphones to listen in….

They call it twilight sleep and a woman don’t feel a thing when the kid comes. So when this friend tells my wife, she says that it’s about time they invented something like that.

What’re you talking about! Gaslight’s out of date. They’re putting ’lectricity even in the cheapest tenements.

Don’t know what’s got into the youngsters nowadays. They’re all dance crazy. Dance…dance…dance….

So I changed my name from Schultz to Scott. The judge says what do you want to go and do that for? Schultz is a good name. He was German himself, see? Listen, Mac, I says…that’s just how I talked to him; judge or no judge. I’m through with the old country, I says. After what they done to them Belgian babies, I says, I want no part of Germany. I’m an American now, I says, and I want an American name.

And we’re heading straight for war. Man, I can see it coming.

All we got to do is to elect Wilson again this fall. He’ll keep us out of war.

Don’t bet on them campaign promises. When you got a Democrat president, you got a war president.

Lincoln was a Republican.

But the south had a Democrat president and they was the ones started the Civil War.

I ask you how long we gotta stand for it? The bastards sunk another one of our ships. How many do they gotta sink before we get up enough nerve to go over there and lick hell out of them?

We got to stay out. This country’s getting along fine. Let them fight their own wars without dragging us in.

We don’t want war.

War’s declared, I’ll enlist the next day.

You can talk. You’re past fifty. They wouldn’t take you.

I’d sooner go to jail than to war.

A feller’s got to fight for what he thinks is right. I’d be glad to go.

I got nothing to worry about. I got a double hernia.

Let the war come. They’ll need us working men then to build their ships and their guns. They’ll need the farmer to grow their food. Then watch them come sucking around us. Us laborers will have the God-damned capitalists by the throat. They won’t tell us. We’ll tell them. By Jesus, we’ll make them sweat. War can’t come quick enough to suit me.

Like I’m telling you. Everything is machines. I heard a joke the other day. Feller and his wife going around getting food, clothes, everything out of machines. So they come to this baby machine and the feller puts money in and out comes a baby. So the feller turns around and says, give me the good old days.

The good old days! Yeah. I guess they’re gone forever.

Fill ’em up again, Jim.

And Francie, pausing in her sweeping to listen, tried to put everything together and tried to understand a world spinning in confusion. And it seemed to her that the whole world changed in between the time that Laurie was born and graduation day.
