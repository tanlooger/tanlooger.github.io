KATIE STAYED IN BED THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL AND FRANCIE and Neeley wandered around the flat stunned and bewildered. Towards evening, Katie got up and made some supper for them. After they had eaten, she urged the children to go for a little walk, saying they needed the air.

Francie and Neeley walked up Graham Avenue towards Broadway. It was a bitterly cold and a still night but there was no snow. The streets were empty. It was three days after Christmas and children were home playing with their new toys. The street lights were bleak and bright. A small icy wind coming in from the sea blew close to the ground. It whirled bits of dirty papers along the gutters.

They had grown out of childhood in the last few days. Christmas as Christmas had passed unnoticed since their father had died on Christmas day. Neeley’s thirteenth birthday had been lost somewhere in those last few days.

They came to the brilliantly lighted façade of a big vaudeville house. Since they were reading children and read everything they came across, they stopped and automatically read the list of acts playing that week. Underneath the sixth act, was an announcement in large letters.

“Here next week! Chauncy Osborne, Sweet Singer of Sweet Songs. Don’t miss him!”

Sweet Singer…Sweet Singer…

Francie had not shed a tear since her father’s death. Neither had Neeley. Now Francie felt that all the tears she had were frozen together in her throat in a solid lump and the lump was growing…growing. She felt that if the lump didn’t melt soon and change back into tears, she too would die. She looked at Neeley. Tears were falling out of his eyes. Then her tears came, too.

They turned into a dark side street and sat on the edge of the sidewalk with their feet in the gutter. Neeley, though weeping, remembered to spread his handkerchief on the curb so that his new long pants wouldn’t get dirty. They sat close together because they were cold and lonesome. They wept long and quietly, sitting there in the cold street. At last, when they could cry no more, they talked.

“Neeley, why did Papa have to die?”

“I guess God wanted him to die.”

“Why?”

“Maybe to punish him.”

“Punish him for what?”

“I don’t know,” said Neeley miserably.

“Do you believe that God put Papa on this world?”

“Yes.”

“Then He wanted him to live, didn’t He?”

“I guess so.”

“Then why did He make him die so quick?”

“Maybe to punish him,” repeated Neeley not knowing what else to answer.

“If that’s true, what good is it? Papa’s dead and he don’t know that he’s punished. God made Papa the way he was and then said to Himself, I dare you to do anything about it. I just bet He said that.”

“Maybe you shouldn’t talk about God like that,” said Neeley apprehensively.

“They say God’s so great,” said Francie scornfully, “and knows everything and can do everything. If He’s so great, why didn’t He help Papa instead of punishing him like you said?”

“I just said maybe.”

“If God has charge of all the world,” said Francie, “and the sun and the moon and the stars and all the birds and trees and flowers and all the animals and people, you’d think He’d be too busy and too important—wouldn’t you—to spend so much time punishing one man—one man like Papa.”

“I don’t think you should talk about God like that,” said Neeley uneasily. “He might strike you down dead.”

“Then let Him,” cried Francie fiercely. “Let Him strike me down dead right here in the gutter where I sit!”

They waited fearfully. Nothing happened. When Francie spoke again, she was quieter.

“I believe in the Lord, Jesus Christ, and His Mother, Holy Mary. Jesus was a living baby once. He went barefooted like we do in the summer. I saw a picture where He was a boy and had no shoes on. And when He was a man, He went fishing, like Papa did once. And they could hurt Him too, like they couldn’t hurt God. Jesus wouldn’t go around punishing people. He knew about people. So I will always believe in Jesus Christ.”

They made the sign of the cross as Catholics do when mentioning Jesus’ name. Then she put her hand on Neeley’s knee and spoke in a whisper.

“Neeley, I wouldn’t tell anybody but you, but I don’t believe in God anymore.”

“I want to go home,” said Neeley. He was shivering.

When Katie let them in, she saw that their faces were tired, yet peaceful. “Well, they’ve cried it out,” she thought.

Francie looked at her mother, then looked away quickly. “While we were gone,” she thought, “she cried and cried until she couldn’t cry any more.” The weeping wasn’t mentioned aloud by any one of them.

“I thought you’d come home cold,” said Mama, “so I made a warm surprise for you.”

“What?” asked Neeley.

“You’ll see.”

The surprise was “hot chocolate” which was cocoa and condensed milk made into a paste and boiling water stirred into it. Katie poured the thick rich stuff into the cups. “And that’s not all,” she added. She took three marshmallows from a paper bag in her apron pocket and popped one into each cup.

“Mama!” said the children simultaneously and ecstatically. “Hot chocolate” was something extra special, usually reserved for birthdays.

“Mama is really somebody,” thought Francie as she held her marshmallow down with her spoon and watched the melting white sworls vein the dark chocolate. “She knows we’ve been crying but she’s not asking questions about it. Mama never…” Suddenly the right word about mama came to Francie. “Mama never fumbles.”

No, Katie never fumbled. When she used her beautifully shaped but worn-looking hands, she used them with surety, whether it was to put a broken flower into a tumbler of water with one true gesture, or to wring out a scrub cloth with one decisive motion—the right hand turning in, and the left out, simultaneously. When she spoke, she spoke truly with the plain right words. And her thoughts walked in a clear uncompromising line.

Mama was saying: “Neeley’s getting too big to sleep in the same room with his sister. So I fixed the room your…” she barely hesitated over the next word, “…father and I used to have. That’s Neeley’s bedroom now.”

Neeley’s eyes jumped to his mother’s. A room of his own! A dream come true; two dreams come true, long pants and a room…His eyes saddened then, as he thought of how these good things had come to him.

“And I’ll share your room, Francie.” Instinctive tact made Katie put it that way instead of saying, “You’ll share my room.”

“I wish I had my own room,” thought Francie with a flare of jealousy. “But it’s right, I guess, that Neeley have it. There are only two bedrooms and he couldn’t sleep with Mama.”

Knowing Francie’s thought, Katie said, “And when it gets warm again, Francie can have the front room. We’ll put her cot in there and put a nice cover on it in the daytime and it will be like a private sitting room. All right, Francie?”

“All right, Mama.”

After a while, Mama said: “We forgot the reading the last few nights but now we’ll start again.”

“So things will go on just the same,” thought Francie, a little surprised, as she took the Bible from the mantelpiece.

“Being,” said Mama, “that we lost Christmas this year, let’s skip the part we’re supposed to read and go to the birth of the Baby Jesus. We’ll take turns reading. You start, Francie.”

Francie read.

…and so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in the manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

Katie sighed sharply. Francie stopped reading and looked up inquiringly. “It’s nothing,” said Mama. “Go on reading.”

“No, it’s nothing,” Katie thought. “It’s the time when I should feel life.” Again the unborn child trembled faintly within her. “Was it because he knew of this coming child,” she wondered silently, “that he stopped drinking at the last?” She had whispered to him that they were to have another child. Had he tried to be different when he knew? And knowing, did he die in the trying to be a better man? “Johnny…Johnny…” She sighed again.

And they read, each in turn, of the birth of Jesus, and reading, they thought of Johnny dying. But each kept his thoughts.

When the children were ready to go to bed, Katie did something very unusual. It was unusual because she was not a demonstrative woman. She held the children close to her and kissed them good night.

“From now on,” she said, “I am your mother and your father.”
