## Introduction

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!



### What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.



Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.



Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.



### Main Features

Some of the main Next.js features include:



|Feature	|Description|
| ------- | --------- |
|Routing	|A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.|
|Rendering	|Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.|
|Data Fetching|Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.|
|Styling|Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS|
|Optimizations| Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.|
|TypeScript	|Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.|

### How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.



On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).



To get started, checkout the Installation guide.


### Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.



To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out our Next.js Foundations Course, which will introduce you to the fundamentals.



### Accessibility

For optimal accessibility when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.

Installation

System Requirements:



Node.js 16.14 or later.

macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:



Terminal



npx create-next-app@latest

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:



Terminal



What is your project named? my-app

Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes

Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes

Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes

Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes

Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes

Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes

What import alias would you like configured? @/*

After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.



Good to know:



Next.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default.

You can optionally use a src directory in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.

Manual Installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:



Terminal



npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

Open your package.json file and add the following scripts:



package.json


```
{

  "scripts": {

    "dev": "next dev",

    "build": "next build",

    "start": "next start",

    "lint": "next lint"

  }

}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:



dev: runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode.

build: runs next build to build the application for production usage.

start: runs next start to start a Next.js production server.

lint: runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

Creating directories

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.



The app directory

For new applications, we recommend using the App Router. This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the Pages Router based on community feedback.



Create an app/ folder, then add a layout.tsx and page.tsx file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).



App Folder Structure



Create a root layout inside app/layout.tsx with the required <html> and <body> tags:



app/layout.tsx



TypeScript


```
export default function RootLayout({

  children,

}: {

  children: React.ReactNode

}) {

  return (

    <html lang="en">

      <body>{children}</body>

    </html>

  )

}
```

Finally, create a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:



app/page.tsx



TypeScript


```
export default function Page() {

  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>

}
```

Good to know: If you forget to create layout.tsx, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with next dev.



Learn more about using the App Router.



The pages directory (optional)

If you prefer to use the Pages Router instead of the App Router, you can create a pages/ directory at the root of your project.



Then, add an index.tsx file inside your pages folder. This will be your home page (/):



pages/index.tsx



TypeScript


```
export default function Page() {

  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>

}
```

Next, add an _app.tsx file inside pages/ to define the global layout. Learn more about the custom App file.



pages/_app.tsx



TypeScript


```
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

 

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {

  return <Component {...pageProps} />

}
```

Finally, add a _document.tsx file inside pages/ to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the custom Document file.



pages/_document.tsx



TypeScript


```
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

 

export default function Document() {

  return (

    <Html>

      <Head />

      <body>

        <Main />

        <NextScript />

      </body>

    </Html>

  )

}
```

Learn more about using the Pages Router.



Good to know: Although you can use both routers in the same project, routes in app will be prioritized over pages. We recommend using only one router in your new project to avoid confusion.



The public folder (optional)

Create a public folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).



Run the Development Server

Run npm run dev to start the development server.

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.

Edit app/layout.tsx (or pages/index.tsx) file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

App Router

The Next.js App Router is a new paradigm for building applications using React's latest features. If you're already familiar with Next.js, you'll find that the App Router is a natural evolution of the existing file-system based router in the Pages Router.



For new applications, we recommend using the App Router. For existing applications, you can incrementally adopt the App Router. It's also possible to use both routers in the same application.



Frequently Asked Questions

How can I access the request object in a layout?

You intentionally cannot access the raw request object. However, you can access headers and cookies through server-only functions. You can also set cookies.



Layouts do not rerender. They can be cached and reused to avoid unnecessary computation when navigating between pages. By restricting layouts from accessing the raw request, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.



This design also enforces consistent and predictable behavior for layouts across different pages, simplify development and debugging since developers can rely on layouts behaving the same way regardless of the specific page they are applied to.



Depending on the UI pattern you're building, Parallel Routes allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.



How can I access the URL on a page?

By default, pages are Server Components. You can access the route segments through the params prop and the URL search params through the searchParams prop for a given page.



If you are using Client Components, you can use usePathname, useSelectedLayoutSegment, and useSelectedLayoutSegments for more complex routes.



Further, depending on the UI pattern you're building, Parallel Routes allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.



How can I redirect from a Server Component?

You can use redirect to redirect from a page to a relative or absolute URL. redirect is a temporary (307) redirect, while permanentRedirect is a permanent (308) redirect. When these functions are used while streaming UI, they will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side.



How can I handle authentication with the App Router?

Here are some common authentication solutions that support the App Router:



NextAuth.js

Clerk

Auth0

Stytch

Or manually handling sessions or JWTs

How can I set cookies?

You can set cookies in Server Actions or Route Handlers using the cookies function.



Since HTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, you cannot set cookies from a page or layout directly. You can also set cookies from Middleware.



How can I build multi-tenant apps?

If you are looking to build a single Next.js application that serves multiple tenants, we have built an example showing our recommended architecture.



How can I invalidate the App Router cache?

There are multiple layers of caching in Next.js, and thus, multiple ways to invalidate different parts of the cache. Learn more about caching.



Are there any comprehensive, open-source applications built on the App Router?

Yes. You can view Next.js Commerce or the Platforms Starter Kit for two larger examples of using the App Router that are open-source.









Building Your Application

Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications. The guides in Building Your Application explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.



The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.



If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the Routing, Rendering, Data Fetching and Styling sections, as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started. Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as Optimizing and Configuring. Finally, once you're ready, checkout the Deploying and Upgrading sections.
