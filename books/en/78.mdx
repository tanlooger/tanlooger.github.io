To my parents, my siblings, and my wife.





The Yangtze’s roaring waters roll ever eastward,

Their spray washes away gallant heroes.

Rights and wrongs, triumphs and failures, all ebb into emptiness,

But the lush hills remain, and the scarlet sunsets repeat.

—From “Linjiangxian · Gungun Changjiang Dongshishui,” or “Immortal by the River · The Yangtze’s Roaring Waters Roll Ever Eastward,” a verse by Ming dynasty poet Yang Shen1

AUTHOR’S NOTE


This book draws on my firsthand reporting as a China correspondent for the Wall Street Journal since 2014. I worked in Beijing for five years before moving to Hong Kong in 2019, when the Chinese government declined to renew my press credentials and forced me to leave the mainland.

The Communist Party and its black-box bureaucracy are notoriously hard to penetrate. Even privileged insiders can struggle to pry beyond their immediate environs within a secretive Leninist system. And covering Chinese politics gets harder the farther one operates from the seat of national power, as it becomes more difficult to arrange the face-to-face meetings that are most conducive for candid conversations, and to experience tactile shifts in the political climate and public mood. Reporting for this book, therefore, required resourcefulness and humility—making use of contacts and research techniques that I had cultivated throughout my five years in mainland China, and understanding that any attempt to examine the party’s inner workings can yield only partial glimpses of a complex picture.

Xi Jinping, since becoming China’s paramount leader, has rarely given face-to-face interviews or fielded questions from foreign journalists. Nonetheless, a detailed account of Xi’s life, influences, ideas, and policies can be constructed from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources. The materials I consulted include Xi’s writings, public speeches, internal remarks; interviews from his earlier career; as well as authorized biographies and memoirs of people who knew him, including his father and maternal uncle. I also reviewed party and state documents, official histories, memoirs, archival papers, state-media reports, as well as academic literature published in China and elsewhere. Notwithstanding the discernment that reporters and researchers must apply when handling open-source material often crafted for propaganda purposes, there is much knowledge that can be distilled from scrutinizing what Xi and the party say—both plainly and implicitly—among themselves and to the 1.4 billion people they govern.

I also used information gleaned from conversations with party insiders, officials, diplomats, academics, lawyers, business executives, and ordinary people whom I met in China. Many of them spoke on the record, though many more preferred anonymity, given the sensitivities of discussing political matters. Where sources can’t be precisely identified, I provide contextual details—either within the text or in endnotes—to help readers understand where the information came from, and assess its reliability.





INTRODUCTION


POWER TO THE PARTY


“The party, government, military, society, education; north, south, east, west, center—the party leads everything.”

—Xi Jinping



Weeks after becoming general secretary of China’s Communist Party, Xi Jinping summoned hundreds of top officials to an elite political academy in northwestern Beijing, a cluster of austere buildings embellished with wide lawns and a willow-lined lake, near old imperial gardens where Qing emperors once lived. Here, in early January 2013, amid wintry hues of yellow and brown, Xi laid out his priorities as China’s new leader.

His speech was somber. He recalled the crumbling of the Iron Curtain more than two decades ago and warned that Communist China could suffer the same fate. “Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered,” Xi told officials at the Central Party School.1 “Their ideology became confused, party groups at all levels became virtually ineffective, even the military was no longer under the party’s leadership. In the end, a party as vast as the Soviet Communist Party scattered like birds and beasts, and a socialist state as colossal as the Soviet Union fell to pieces. This is a warning from the past!”

At the time there were few signs suggesting an imminent collapse of the People’s Republic, already the world’s second-largest economy and a superpower-in-waiting. The party’s embrace of pragmatic politics and market-style reforms more than three decades earlier had pulled China away from the calamitous radicalism that marred Mao Zedong’s dictatorship, delivering relative stability and unprecedented prosperity. A spectacular Beijing Olympics and the implosion of the Western financial system in 2008 cemented China’s ascendancy and, in the eyes of many Chinese, vindicated the country’s much-maligned model of authoritarian capitalism. Bitter memories of 1989, when mass protests in Beijing and other cities shook the party, had faded from public consciousness. China’s pivot—from socialist dogma to state capitalism and from dictatorship to collective rule—seemed unquestionable. Xi himself, soon after taking power, declared that the “China Dream” of restoring national glory was at hand. “We are more confident and capable of achieving it than at any other time in history,” he said.

But this seeming stability masked turbulent undercurrents. Economic expansion was slowing, as the excesses of debt-driven growth took their toll. Income inequality widened, corruption grew, pollution worsened, and social unrest soared. Ethnic tensions in the restive borderlands of Tibet and Xinjiang flared into deadly riots. Public intellectuals lamented that China’s rapid enrichment had unmoored its spiritual anchors. As society atomizes into self-centered individuals, “all kinds of bonds and interpersonal connections will be lost,” Chinese philosophy professor Tian Yipeng warned in 2012. “Selfish solipsism will be in vogue across society, causing social constraints to dissolve and pushing society toward the dangers of disorder.”2

The Communist Party itself grappled with internal strife. Ideological cleavages divided the ruling elite. Advocates for stronger state control vied for influence against those who championed the private sector, civil society, and the rule of law. Shadowy contests for promotions and influence burst into the open in the months before the party congress in 2012 where Xi would take power. The party purged a high-flying regional leader, Bo Xilai, who supported a Maoist revival and state-led economic development, weeks after his former police chief fled to a U.S. consulate and aired allegations that Bo’s wife had murdered a British businessman. The son of a top aide to the incumbent leader died in a fiery Ferrari crash, embarrassing the party and precipitating his father’s downfall. Xi himself mysteriously disappeared for two weeks as the party congress neared, canceling meetings with foreign officials and sowing speculation over his health.

Xi emerged unscathed, assuming his place atop the party’s new seven-man leadership. With order seemingly restored, he acknowledged that business couldn’t go on as usual. “Our party faces many severe challenges, and there are also many pressing problems within the party that need to be resolved,” Xi said in his first public remarks as general secretary. He described a party riddled with graft, out of touch with ordinary people, and crippled by red tape. Its sprawling ranks, numbering more than 85 million at the time, were swollen with careerist, corrupt, and indolent officials seeking sinecures and shirking duties.

The party’s slide toward this moral morass dated back to Mao’s death in 1976. After a brief interregnum, Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader and sought to inoculate the party from the perils of one-man rule. Senior leaders shared power, encouraged timely retirement, and made plans for orderly succession. Though Deng himself dominated politics until his death in 1997, he and his supporters tried to professionalize the government, fast-tracking capable cadres up the hierarchy. They seeded pro-market reforms that spurred China’s economic miracle, bringing about three decades of breakneck growth. Millions of rural Chinese rushed into the cities to fill jobs on expanding factory floors. Private businesses flourished and living standards soared. Hundreds of millions joined the country’s fast-swelling middle class. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, foreign investment flooded in while exports poured out across the globe.

Along the way, the party shed its revolutionary zeal and developed a ruthless pragmatism. Deng promoted his own brand of trickle-down economics, saying the government should allow “some people and some regions to get rich first” to spur development. His use of a proverb from his native Sichuan province—a cat, whether yellow or black, is a good feline if it can catch mice—brought the celebrated “cat analogy” into the public consciousness, and encapsulated the can-do spirit that animated the “reform era.” Local authorities felt empowered to experiment with new ideas, and officials were judged on their ability to deliver growth and stability, rather than their ideological rectitude.

The party loosened its totalitarian grip and a once-omnipresent state sector receded, allowing ordinary Chinese more autonomy over their lives. People could largely pursue their material aspirations as long as they didn’t challenge the party’s authority. Authorities grew more tolerant of intellectual diversity, as pockets of independent thinking and journalism flourished with the emergence of commercial news outlets and social media. The party diluted its socialist ideals, welcoming entrepreneurs to join its ranks in the early 2000s and rationalizing yawning wealth gaps as a necessary evil. Officials even debated whether to drop “Communist” from their party’s name. Mao’s most ubiquitous motto, “serve the people,” became so hollow that Chinese writer Yan Lianke used it as the title of his 2005 satirical novel depicting an illicit affair between the wife of a military commander and a peasant soldier.3

With time the ideological decay grew so worrisome that some within the party sensed looming disaster. A year before Xi took power, dozens of his fellow “second-generation reds” assembled in Beijing’s central business district for an unusual confab. It was a who’s who of Communist royalty, including descendants of party grandees, ministers, and generals, and even a half sister of Xi. Officially, the occasion was a seminar marking thirty-five years since the “Gang of Four”—a radical faction led by Mao’s wife—was arrested for fanning the bloody excesses of the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution. But as with many political gatherings in China, discussing the past was a pretext for critiquing the present. Lu De, whose father had been a propaganda minister under Mao, lamented the loss of ideals and rectitude among officials, who he claimed were splurging some 37 percent of all government expenditure on personal perks like dining and travel.4 “The Communist Party is like a surgeon who has cancer,” said Ma Xiaoli, the daughter of a former labor minister. “It can’t remove the tumor by itself, it needs help from others, but without help it can’t survive for long.”5

These “princelings,” as the scions of revolutionary elders and senior officials are known, prescribed a range of remedies. Some demanded a thorough anticorruption purge and more democratic debate within the party leadership. Others called for efforts to foster the rule of law, using constitutional checks and balances to prevent the party from using power arbitrarily. Many of them wanted a firmer hand on the tiller, from someone who shared their commitment to the party’s revolutionary legacy. But for all their demands for change, these red aristocrats brooked no question over how far reforms can go. “In today’s China,” Lu said, “there’s no political party that can replace the Communist Party.”6

The party has flirted with doom many times. But the 1989 protests on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where as many as a million people rallied to demand greater political freedoms, and fall of the Soviet bloc cast a particularly long shadow over the People’s Republic. While Deng crushed the protests with military force, the demise of socialist regimes across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe shook China, where officials and scholars obsessed over the causes and debated ways to avoid a similar fate. Some traced the Soviet collapse to policy and economic stagnation under Leonid Brezhnev’s leadership from 1964 to 1982. Others blamed Mikhail Gorbachev and the U.S. strategy of encouraging “peaceful evolution” in socialist regimes. “The efforts by international capitalist forces to subvert socialist systems through ‘peaceful evolution’ will get more and more intense,” wrote Xi in late 1991, as a municipal party boss.7 “They will never give up on subverting, infiltrating, damaging and disturbing a major socialist power like us.” When Xi had started out as a county official in the early 1980s, the Cold War was raging, China stood among dozens of socialist states flying the flag for world communism, and U.S. President Ronald Reagan declared that the march of freedom and democracy “will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history.”8 By the time Xi took power, capitalism had become global orthodoxy, only five socialist states remained, and the People’s Republic was just sixty-three years old—a shade short of the Soviet Union’s sixty-nine-year run.

Generations of Chinese have been schooled to channel their patriotism through a rousing revolutionary anthem: “Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China.” And so it has been for Xi. Born just a few years after Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic, Xi has known no political power in China but the party. A princeling son of a revolutionary hero, he enjoyed an elite upbringing that imbued him with a sense of entitlement and an ironclad commitment to Communist rule. An unelected authoritarian leader, he asserts a personal legitimacy that is inseparable from the party’s moral claims to power. Whereas Mao’s revolutionary exploits made him a living deity, Xi owes everything to the party that raised him, shaped him, and empowered him. His authority emanates entirely from the offices he holds and the political structures those positions command. “The party is the power in China, and Xi is only powerful through it,” wrote Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London. “He has no existence separate from the culture of the party, and no autonomy from it.”9

There are more practical considerations too. The party imposed a political monopoly so complete that it has intertwined itself with almost every fiber of Chinese society. Party members overwhelmingly staff government agencies from Beijing down to remote village offices. They control the mass media, manage state-owned companies, supervise civic and religious groups, and preside over chambers of commerce and labor unions. They command the domestic security forces and the People’s Liberation Army, the ultimate enforcers of party authority. In the Chinese body politic, the party acts as the brain, nerves, sinews, and muscles. Its dysfunction imperils the state, but it can’t be easily replaced. For Xi, and others invested in perpetuating Communist rule, the only option is to heal.

The maladies, as Xi diagnosed them, are multifold. He saw that a diffuse leadership was impeding the decisive governance that China needed to cope with twenty-first-century challenges. A corrupt and bloated bureaucracy was eroding the party’s moral standing and ability to govern. A better educated, more pluralistic, and increasingly complex society was tearing at the party’s levers of control. The main anchors of party legitimacy—economic progress and social mobility—were becoming harder to keep in place as China switched gears toward slower, more sustainable growth. Its abandonment of communism, in practice if not in name, meant new ideological glue was needed to unite its members. Such challenges, Xi warned, could “ruin the party and ruin the nation.”10

Rejuvenating the party was an immense and risky undertaking. Vested interests must be challenged, powerful rivals subdued, and rank-and-file members antagonized. Xi signaled an appreciation of the magnitude of his task. For his first trip outside Beijing as general secretary, he traveled to the coastal province of Guangdong, echoing Deng’s famous “southern tour” two decades earlier, when the elder statesman had exerted his personal influence to revive economic reforms stifled by party conservatives. Xi made a show of honoring Deng, laying a floral basket at a statue of the late leader and pledging to uphold his legacy. Away from the cameras, however, Xi revealed the true parallel between Deng’s sojourn and his own “new southern tour”—a show of force against political opponents.

“Ideals and beliefs are the ‘spiritual calcium’ for communists. Those lacking or wavering in their ideals and belief would suffer a deficiency in ‘spiritual calcium’ and be plagued by soft bones,” Xi said in a secret speech that filtered out weeks later through Hong Kong and foreign media. “Proportionally the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to step forward and resist,” he said.11 Where Gorbachev had failed, he shall succeed.

And resist Xi did. He would centralize decision-making authority and strengthen his control over all levers of party power, from village committees to the armed forces. He would set an expansive definition of national security, directing the state’s coercive apparatus to suppress threats to China’s economy, social stability, territorial unity, and one-party system. He would tap the party’s history for its reservoirs of legitimacy, recounting tales of triumph and sacrifice against foreign imperialists and internal enemies. He would promote Confucian philosophy and cultural traditions, stoking a sense of Chinese civilizational pride that could counter Western ideals of individual freedom and democracy. He would fan nationalist passions around Communist rule, pledging to restore China’s glory as a great power. At a personal level, Xi would meld his elite pedigree with a populist touch, styling himself as a decisive leader who could inspire loyalty and win mass support.

He began with a cleansing, launching a withering crackdown on corruption that punished more than 1.6 million people during his first five years in power. He targeted everyone from rank-and-file “flies” to top-tier “tigers,” including senior officials, executives, generals, and a retired member of the party leadership. He arrested China’s capitalist advance, reining in private entrepreneurs who strayed from the party’s interests, and reinstating the state’s visible hand in shaping the economy. His administration issued a directive, known as Document Number 9, that denounced Western ideas and demanded efforts to reinforce the party’s dominance of ideology. He revived Maoist slogans and practices, waging ideological purges and demanding officials engage in self-criticism. He even restored the centrality of Marxism as the party’s guiding philosophy, celebrating the two hundredth anniversary of Karl Marx’s birth and calling on party members and ordinary Chinese to study the Communist Manifesto.

In his 2010 book, The Party, Richard McGregor described a panopticon-like institution controlling China largely from the shadows, positioned “to keep an eye on any state or non-state agency, while shielding itself from view at the same time.” Its leaders, he said, airbrushed their Marxist ideology, donned suit jackets instead of Mao-style tunics, and masked their influence over business, academia, and civil society. “When it interacts with the outside world, the party is careful to keep a low profile. Sometimes, you can’t see the party at all,” McGregor wrote.12 These observations were true at the time, but they no longer hold. The party of Xi celebrates its Marxist roots, flexes its coercive powers, and hides behind no one. Its leader demands to be seen, heard, and obeyed.

Where pragmatic innovation once flourished, Xi imposed “top-level design,” placing the party unequivocally in charge of policy-making and reclaiming responsibilities once delegated to technocrats and specialists. Party committees have come to the fore, setting policies in their own name and siphoning authority from government ministries. Officials and state-enterprise executives openly brandish their party roles, listing them before their professional titles. Private companies that once played down their party connections now trumpet those ties. Rank-and-file party members, once conscious of their reputations as craven careerists, increasingly showcase their identities by wearing party insignia.

The shakeup elevated Xi’s powers to an apogee unseen since Mao. His name adorns every government directive, his image plastered ubiquitously across newsprint, television screens, and propaganda posters, and his ideas hailed as “Marxism of the twenty-first century.” Xi himself invokes the Chairman, borrowing his slogans, rehashing his tactics, and taking on grandiose titles such as the “people’s leader” that echo Mao’s accolades. But there are differences between master and disciple. While Mao could mobilize the masses to “bombard the headquarters” and attack the party’s fossilizing bureaucracy from the outside, Xi relies on party institutions to execute his edicts. A deified Mao could transcend the party, but a mortal Xi is nothing without it. Or as Xi describes it, “the party’s in our blood.”13

Xi sought similar preeminence by turning to the true source of the party’s power—its stories. Mao was a superlative storyteller, famously invoking the ancient Chinese fable “Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains” as a rallying cry against imperialist and feudal oppression and to build a powerful, prosperous “new China.”14 Mao’s successors ditched his utopian ideals but clung to his narrative of national redemption, though none could or wanted to rouse mass fervor. Deng largely governed from the shadows and urged his countrymen to “hide our light and bide our time”—or keep a low profile while building China’s strengths. His successor, Jiang Zemin, exuded an ebullient persona but deviated little from Deng’s doctrine of contrived modesty. Hu Jintao, Xi’s predecessor, championed China’s “peaceful development” and pledged to build a “harmonious society,” but these amorphous aspirations fizzled in the public imagination, much like Hu’s placid personality.

The Communist Party can retain power through coercion, but to flourish it must persuade. Xi emerged as storyteller-in-chief, promising a Chinese manifest destiny that only he could deliver. He cast aside Deng’s gradualist approach, declaring that decisive leadership will take China back to its rightful place as a great power. He promised a more egalitarian society, girded by a vibrant and self-reliant economy, secured by a first-rate military, and led by a resilient ruling party. And while his recent predecessors kept their private lives occluded, Xi thrust his personal story into the public eye. State media mythologized him as a committed communist who inherited his parents’ revolutionary spirit and earned his spurs through hardship and sacrifice. “Xi Jinping is the new architect of China’s pathway to becoming a major power,” said Gong Fangbin, a professor at Beijing’s National Defense University. “Mao Zedong let the Chinese people stand up, Deng Xiaoping let the Chinese people get rich, Xi Jinping will let the Chinese people get strong.”15

This exalting narrative extends far beyond China’s borders. Xi styled himself as a forceful defender of Chinese sovereignty, unafraid to challenge the West and unapologetic in defying diplomatic norms. He launched the “Belt and Road” initiative, an ambitious effort to develop global trade infrastructure and export China’s excess industrial capacity. His administration poured loans and aid into developing countries and established a Beijing-led multilateral lender, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to pry loose Western dominance over international development finance. Xi told officials to “tell China’s stories well,” portray their nation as a responsible power, and proffer Chinese solutions for global issues like poverty alleviation and climate change. Beijing lobbied successfully for Chinese officials to lead United Nations agencies overseeing civil aviation, food and agriculture, and telecommunications. China ramped up contributions to the U.N. peacekeeping program, becoming its second-biggest funder and the largest provider of peacekeepers among major powers. The People’s Liberation Army flexed its growing muscles, establishing a naval base in Djibouti, sending long-range patrols into the Pacific Ocean, and conducting combat drills around the island democracy of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.

Such forward-leaning diplomacy won plaudits at home but rankled audiences abroad. Beijing’s forceful assertion of territorial claims—from building artificial islands in the South China Sea to sending civilian fishing fleets and coast guard craft into disputed waters—inflamed tensions with Asian neighbors and sparked border skirmishes with India. Western democracies denounced the party’s overseas outreach as influence-peddling operations, while Xi’s appeals for a Chinese diaspora to rally around their motherland irked countries with large ethnic Chinese communities. Beijing’s “wolf warrior” diplomats riled foreign governments with pugnacious behavior aimed at satisfying Xi’s demands for a more combative statecraft. China engaged in what critics condemned as “hostage diplomacy,” detaining foreign nationals for leverage in disputes with other powers. African governments that received copious Chinese aid faced domestic anger over Beijing’s allegedly neocolonialist practices. Anti-China sentiment surged, particularly in the West, as the novel coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and engulfed the world—a resentment aggravated by the party’s efforts to shout down criticism of its Covid-19 response and questions about the contagion’s origins.

The rise of a confident, uncompromising China grated most of all on the United States, the incumbent superpower that spent decades engaging Beijing and building economic ties so deep that academics dubbed the economic relationship “Chimerica.” Today, U.S. politicians and academics warn of a “new Cold War” as Washington vies with Beijing over trade, technology, military power, and global influence. Getting tough on China has become bipartisan consensus in a divided Washington. Both Democrats and Republicans have demanded action against Beijing’s industrial policies and human rights abuses, particularly its treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and the suppression of dissent in the former British colony of Hong Kong.

Xi’s methods have been questioned at home too. Party insiders blame his domineering style for stifling internal debate and leading to policy blunders. His top-down leadership engenders excessive bureaucracy, as officials resort to inaction, duplicity, and other unproductive practices to please Beijing and protect their careers. Some of Xi’s most ambitious programs appear to have stalled, with his Belt and Road initiative drawing backlash for saddling developing countries with debt and plans to build a new economic center—the “Xiong’an New Area” in northern China—yielding sparse progress. Despite Xi’s dominance, he has struggled to enact crucial but contentious reforms to address China’s declining productivity and aging population. His zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19, while successful in containing the virus during early phases of the pandemic, throttled the domestic economy and inflamed social tensions with harsh lockdowns (before unraveling in the face of faster-spreading Covid variants). On social media, where embers of political satire still flicker, detractors deride Xi as the “accelerator-in-chief,” implying that his full-throttle authoritarianism will send the party careening toward collapse.

Xi has remained resolute. He renewed demands for ideological probity and patriotic zeal. He blamed policy inertia and missteps on the moral failings of individual officials, eliding the structural ills endemic in a one-party system and aggravated by his centralization of power. Those who dared question his leadership were harassed, locked up, or forced into exile. China’s proclaimed success in challenging the West across economic and military fronts vindicated Xi’s methods in the eyes of many Chinese. And where he recognized shortcomings in his system, he doubled down on his prescribed remedies, insisting that the party become stronger and more loyal than ever to its leader.

These maneuvers propelled Xi’s authority to a new zenith in 2022. He pushed rivals into retirement, packed allies into the party leadership, took a norm-breaking third term as general secretary, and declined to designate an heir apparent—all but obliterating his predecessors’ efforts to ensure regular succession. After a decade in power, Xi had cemented his status as China’s most formidable leader since Mao. But while his ruling party projects imperious confidence, a seemingly stable system can prove surprisingly brittle—particularly one built so inextricably around one man. His accession was only the second time the People’s Republic conducted a handover of power that was triggered neither by the leader’s death nor a political crisis. Now poised to rule indefinitely without a clear successor, Xi represents key-person risk like no other, a singular vulnerability that could unleash profound consequences for China and the rest of the world.

How did Xi upend decades of collective leadership and realign Chinese politics around himself? Can his autocratic turn save the party, or does it sow the seeds for future turmoil? Will he make the world safe for an increasingly authoritarian China, or return his country to the ruinous days of one-man rule? These questions have become harder to answer. Foreign journalists face growing harassment and even expulsion. Diplomats lament shrinking access to Chinese officials. Some academics now think twice about visiting the People’s Republic, concerned that they may be detained. Foreign businesses are reconsidering their investments as the Chinese economy grows increasingly opaque and driven by political imperatives. Fearmongering and misinformation about China have colored public opinion and policy debates as governments around the world seek a new modus vivendi with Beijing.

For decades, deciphering the party’s intentions and dissecting its inner workings have been the preserve of specialists—academics, diplomats, corporate executives, and journalists. Today, encounters with China are no longer a matter of choice. The party of Xi reaches around the globe, and its decisions affect politics, business, and ordinary lives just about anywhere—from Wall Street and Silicon Valley to far-flung factory floors intertwined with Chinese trade. Understanding China has never been more essential. To do so, one must start by seeing the world through the eyes of its most powerful leader in generations, and the political machine that he commands.
