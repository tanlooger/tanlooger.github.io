title: 14 The Hard Part
---






I had visited KFB headquarters numerous times, but I had never felt the way I did walking into the building for the official signing of the final deal. Today, I knew the bank was ours. Anyone who has ever bought his or her dream house has felt the same way the first time they crossed the threshold after the closing. The building's broad white façade, its entrance, the spacious lobby, and the customers and employees—it all looked dear and close to me.

The scene contrasted sharply from what had unfolded at the signing of the TOI, when stone-faced Mr. Noh and I had sat on opposite sides of a table in a silent, crowded room, signing documents. Less than an hour earlier, all of us looked disheveled and haggard, having worked through many nights without rest. Now everyone was in their best suit, clean-shaven and radiant. We had all worked so incredibly hard—against all odds, it seemed—in the past few months to cross the finish line. Even though everyone was utterly sleep deprived, no one wanted to miss this moment, which we already knew would go down in Korean banking history.

Executive Director Dong-jun Paeng of the KDIC, Chairman Shee-yul Ryoo of KFB, and I greeted each other warmly before entering the big conference room where the signing was to take place. It was packed with members of the press, both reporters and photographers. On the wall, a large banner with blue lettering read KFB Definitive Agreement Signing Ceremony in English and Korean, with the red KFB thumbs-up logo beneath it. On a long table were two blue folders and two pens. The stage was set.

Paeng and I each proceeded to take a seat at the table. Chairman Ryoo stood beside us. Someone opened the folders for us to sign. Inside each folder was a single signature page. I realized then that this was a symbolic signing, for the cameras. The actual documents were hundreds of pages long and would take far too long to sign in a public ceremony. We each signed the signature page, and someone stepped forward to exchange the folders to countersign. Then we stood up, exchanged folders with each other, and shook hands for the cameras, each holding a folder in our left hand. At that point, the room broke into applause and cameras flashed (Exhibit 11). We also both shook hands with Chairman Ryoo.

After the signing, Paeng and I stood side by side and took questions from the press. I took the opportunity to thank the government for working with us as partners and to praise its representatives for their dedication and professionalism. “They have earned our highest respect,” I emphasized.

Then I announced Newbridge's appointments of Robert T. Barnum as chairman and Wilfred Horie as CEO of the new Korea First Bank. As Barnum was not in Seoul, I invited only Horie to step forward and introduced him to the reporters. In addition to his experiences in consumer banking, I emphasized his background as a member of the Special Forces of the U.S. Army. I presented him as an experienced, tough, and strong leader, the right kind of leader for the new KFB. Horie presented himself well to the reporters. He came across as humble, confident, and experienced. His first introduction to the Korean public could not have gone better. I was impressed and pleased. It seemed to me that the reporters accepted him warmly.

It was not until the news conference ended that I finally reached Bonderman by phone. He was at home in the United States.

“David, we signed,” I said.

“Congratulations,” he said. Then, without a pause, he added, “Now the hard part begins.”

I laughed, knowing that, of course, he was right. This day marked the beginning of our journey to turn around and rebuild the bank, a task that would prove challenging.

After the news conference, a few of us drove to the office of the KDIC. There, Paeng and I got down to the business of signing the actual documents. The several hundred pages were full of marked-up changes, some handwritten, because there was no time for lawyers to produce a clean copy. Nonetheless, we each signed every page to ensure that the whole set of documents was sealed. That afternoon, I was on a flight back to Hong Kong, to spend Christmas with my family.

The New Year was the start of a new millennium. We just barely made it. I closed the year with a final memo, written on the date the clean copies of the deal had been signed:

Today is December 31, 1999, the day of official legal closing for the Korea First Bank transaction. The balance sheet is frozen as of today for the old KFB and the new KFB begins its business on January 1, 2000. The funding by Newbridge will occur sometime around mid-January, probably January 20, 2000. But for all practical purposes, the deal is done.



* * *

We had assembled a high-powered board for KFB. Barnum would be the chairman, and Chul-su Kim, president of Sejong University and formerly Deputy Minister of Trade, would serve as vice chairman. Four Newbridge partners joined the board: Blum, Bonderman, Carroll, and me. We also invited a number of highly accomplished businessmen and bankers to join the board, including Mickey Kantor, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and former Trade Representative; Frank Newman, former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department and former chairman and CEO of Bankers Trust; and Robert Cohen, the former vice chairman of Republic Bank and Head of Americas for the French bank Crédit Lyonnais. O'Hanlon of Lehman Brothers, an experienced and excellent banker who had been working with us throughout the KFB transaction, also joined. So did Tom Barrack, managing partner of Colony Capital, and Francis Yeo, a professor from Singapore.

In addition, each of the three government agencies—the FSC, MOFE, and the KDIC—nominated a board member. Sung-hwan Oh, the FSC appointee, was a professor of Seoul National University. Representing MOFE was Yoon-jae Lee, a former executive director of Export-Import Bank of Korea. Seung-hee Park represented the KDIC, although he would later be replaced by JT Kim.

We held our first board meeting on the 11th floor of the KFB headquarters building in Seoul on January 21. The boardroom was large, with tables and seats arranged in a wide oval. Only a few board members were there in person. Many called in by phone, as our agenda items were few and mostly a formality for that initial meeting. Barnum presided. The official business included the election of Horie as president and CEO and the formation of the audit, compensation, executive, and risk-management committees. We ratified a number of documents related to the bank's agreement with the KDIC, such as the issuance of the bond with warrants, and appointed E&Y to be the bank's external auditor. The entire meeting lasted for just about one hour. That evening the board members went out to celebrate in a Japanese restaurant (Exhibit 13).

If the first board meeting was more form than substance, the second board meeting was all business, with every member attending in person. It took place on March 15, 2000, a fine and sunny day in Seoul. It was springtime and trees were turning green. Everything looked bright under a blue sky.

Before the meeting, at about 8:30 am, Blum, Bonderman, Carroll, and I left the Shilla Hotel to drive to the Blue House to visit with President Dae-jung Kim.

As we approached the Blue House, we could see its blue roof tiles shimmering in the sun. We arrived at about 9:30 am and were led into a large reception room. Soon, President Kim joined us. He had turned 76 in January. With his full head of black hair, he looked much younger than his age, despite walking with a cane. The cane and a slight limp were the scars of an assassination attempt during President Chung-hee Park's rule in 1971, when a truck smashed into Kim's car. As the most well-known political dissident, there was every reason for Chung-hee Park's military regime not to like DJ Kim.

The president greeted us warmly, with a firm handshake. It was the first time I had met him in person, although I had interacted with his staff during the negotiations. Knowing what he had been through, we all had great respect for him. He and Blum took seats side by side in two large sofa chairs in front of a credenza against the wall (Exhibit 12). The rest of us took our seats in a row of chairs on Blum's side. The meeting was ceremonial but everyone was clearly feeling cheerful. I was also filled with overwhelming relief that we had reached such a significant moment.

The president spoke first, expressing his appreciation for the investment Newbridge was making in Korea First Bank. He said the government attached great importance to this transaction and viewed it as a critical step in Korea's banking reforms. “Reforming this bank is at the center of my reform plans,” he stressed.

Blum thanked the president and said that Newbridge was committed to turning around the bank and making it a success. He explained that Newbridge had brought in a world-class management team, and we were off to a good start. He also made it clear that we had strong confidence in the growth of the Korean economy under President Kim's leadership, adding that Newbridge was interested in making more investments in Korea.

As we were driving out of the Blue House compound after the meeting, Blum told me, “We helped him and saved his life.” I was for a moment puzzled about what he meant until I realized his “we” meant the United States. He told me that Kim, a political dissident under the regime of President Chung-hee Park, was abducted by Korea's CIA agents while in exile in Japan. His captors were about to throw him into the sea, but American agents appeared on the scene from nowhere and rescued him. Kim was exiled in America for more than two years, from December 1982 to February 1985, before his return to South Korea.

Some months after our meeting, DJ Kim would receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his Sunshine Policy of rapprochement with North Korea. He recounted his narrow escape in his acceptance speech for the prize:

I have lived, and continue to live, in the belief that God is always with me. I know this from experience. In August of 1973, while exiled in Japan, I was kidnapped from my hotel room in Tokyo by intelligence agents of the then military government of South Korea. The news of the incident startled the world. The agents took me to their boat at anchor along the seashore. They tied me up, blinded me, and stuffed my mouth. Just when they were about to throw me overboard, Jesus Christ appeared before me with such clarity. I clung to him and begged him to save me. At that very moment, an airplane came down from the sky to rescue me from the moment of death.



Maybe the U.S. government had been doing the bidding of Jesus Christ, or maybe it was the other way around. In any case, DJ Kim was a fighter and survivor. He had other brushes with death, including one in 1980, when he was sentenced to be hanged, on charges of sedition and conspiracy, by President Doo-hwan Chun's government. God intervened again, this time through Pope John Paul II, who sent a letter to President Chun asking for clemency. Kim's sentence was commuted to a jail sentence of 20 years. Though not nearly as divine an intervention, the U.S. government helped secure Kim's release from prison in 1982. A diplomat stationed in Seoul at the time once recounted that President Chun agreed to the release after being offered one of the first audiences with the newly elected president, Ronald Reagan, in exchange.

On the same day as our Blue House visit and board meeting, we visited with Nam-koong Hoon, the new chairman and president of the KDIC, which was now our partner in KFB. We also paid a courtesy visit to Chairman Hun-jai Lee. The FSC chairman had managed to survive the KFB deal with his political career intact and in fact had been appointed the Minister of Finance and Economy in January. (We stopped by to see his successor at the FSC, Yong-keun Lee, as well.) Everyone was friendly and warm, although Chairman Lee still complained about certain Koreans who'd claimed to represent Newbridge during our negotiation process. It seemed that the good work of our political advisors had really annoyed him, even though we did not know who those Koreans were and certainly did not authorize any of them to represent Newbridge.

At our second board meeting on the 11th floor of KFB headquarters, the board met with the new management team. In addition to Horie, we had also brought in Duncan Barker, a Scot and veteran banker, as COO, and Ranvir Dewan, an Indian and former Citi banker, as CFO. SH Lee, whom we had sent into the bank back in September of the previous year as part of the transition team to control credit decisions, was made chief credit officer. The management presented the board with a plan and budget for the year 2000. The board members grilled Horie and his team with numerous questions on company operations. It was a tough session, but management did a good job defending its plan and targets for the year. The meeting lasted for more than five hours.

We walked out of Korea First Bank headquarters as twilight was settling in, and we looked around at the bustling foot traffic of people getting off work. Suddenly, Bonderman pointed to a building a short distance away. “Aha, Korea First Chicken!” I looked up to see the bright neon sign of KFC and the smiling face of Colonel Sanders.

That evening, the management of KFB held a reception in the Shilla Hotel ballroom. Several hundred guests attended, including officials from the Blue House and other government agencies. The new chairman of the FSC, Yong-keun Lee, gave a gracious speech congratulating KFB for achieving a great milestone and wishing it a bright future. The room was full of optimism.

The reception was followed by a banquet, on the top floor of the Shilla. In Korean banquets, there are numerous small appetizer dishes, often containing mysterious ingredients. Not all the foreigners found Korean food agreeable with their palates. Bonderman declared, in jest, he would not attend another board meeting in Korea if he were fed Korean food again. He would be perfectly happy with a hamburger or some Korea First Chicken. I had invited Director General Noh and Director BS Kang to the banquet, but neither showed up. I sent a bottle of whiskey to each of them afterward. Kang sent me a letter in response to tell me that he had not received my invitation. He had left the FSC to become the chairman of a securities firm in Seoul and suspected his invitation had been lost in the mail. Noh returned my bottle with a letter saying that, as a government official, he could not accept my gift.

In its first year of operation, the bank made a significant shift toward retail banking, as we had planned. KFB was very much a corporate bank when we first took control, with retail loans, to individuals or households, representing less than 10 percent of the portfolio. By the end of the first year, that figure had jumped to about 40 percent. The change in the loan mix was rapid and significant.

However, not everything worked out to our satisfaction. The size of a bank is typically measured in terms of its total assets. By the time we became owners, KFB's total assets had shrunk to about 29 trillion won (about $25 billion). While our budget called for changes in the asset mix, the bank's total assets were expected to remain largely flat. This was a rather conservative budget, largely because we thought South Korea had not yet fully recovered from the financial crisis, so the economy remained fragile and businesses weak. We did not want to grow our loan books aggressively because doing so would be riskier (except in the retail business, which was both less risky and more profitable). However, management fell short of delivering on total assets by about 10 percent. This resulted in the bank's total assets shrinking further from 29 trillion won to 26 trillion won at the end of the year.

Nevertheless, KFB turned profitable. After two years of multi-billion-dollar losses, the bank generated a net income of about 300 billion won in 2000, the first year under our control. The net profit of the bank in U.S. dollar terms was about $230 million, despite the fact that the won had weakened against the U.S. dollar during the year, eroding the bank's dollar-denominated returns. The return on equity capital, which is the ratio of net earnings as a percentage of book value of our equity capital, was about 25 percent. This was a good achievement and it seemed that all of our efforts were paying off. But Newbridge and the board of directors thought we could do even better.

A year later, Bonderman and I were riding in a car together again. This time it was in Tokyo, on a sunny and beautiful day in May 2001. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face as I looked out of the window to take in the view as the car sped by the large open plaza in front of the Imperial Palace. I was tired because I had not slept the previous night. I had taken a 3 am flight from Hong Kong to Osaka and then transited from Osaka to Tokyo to arrive in time to meet with Bonderman. I was fighting to stay awake, while Bonderman read that day's Wall Street Journal. Suddenly, he thrust the paper in front of me.

“Did you see this?” he asked, pointing to an article in the paper. “Do you know about this Hynix thing?”

“What Hynix thing?” I asked. Without waiting for his answer, I took the paper to read.

The article was about the financial troubles of Hynix Semiconductor, a major computer chip manufacturer in South Korea and formerly part of the Hyundai Group. Hynix was near bankruptcy, having failed to make payments on its debts. The report noted that many banks had lent to Hynix, including KFB. Now Hynix was in need of a rescue by its creditors. It was negotiating with the banks to restructure its loans. The rescue effort was coordinated by the financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Services under the FSC, which meant that the lending banks, including KFB, would have little choice but to bail out Hynix. That would involve lending new money to an essentially insolvent firm, and it might lead to a substantial haircut, or reduction, on the value of existing Hynix loans and major losses for lenders.

The news was astounding. It was even more disturbing because we had not known anything about it, despite the biweekly calls between KFB's senior management and the board's Executive Committee, which included Barnum, Blum, Bonderman, Newman, and me. The Risk Management Committee of the board should have flagged any large and risky loan exposures. But we had been left in the dark about a major exposure to Hynix and the borrower's financial troubles.

I immediately called SH Lee, the chief credit officer of KFB. Lee was a graduate of Yonsei University in Seoul and spoke good English, which he no doubt honed during his 16-year career as a credit officer with Bank of America. He had been working with us since the middle of our process to acquire KFB, first helping us analyze the credit quality of the loan portfolio and then as a credit officer to vet lending decisions. If anything, his reputation was to err on the conservative side, so we wondered how he had missed this.

Bonderman and I were even more surprised when Lee told us that the bank's exposure to Hynix was about 250 billion won, or about $200 million, that the loan was already classified as “substandard,” and that the bank had made a 20 percent provision against it. We were shocked, for two reasons. First, if there was one lesson to be drawn from the previous failure of KFB, it was that overexposure to a few large corporate customers was a major risk. To avoid this, the board had established a house limit for all loans. Any exposure of more than 100 billion won to a single customer required board approval. We could not understand how the bank had an exposure of 250 billion won to Hynix, clearly in breach of the house limit, without board members knowing about it.

Second, we hadn't heard anything about it even after Hynix got into financial difficulties, and we only learned the bad news from the newspaper. We should have been kept abreast of all the major issues in the bank by the KFB management.

The matter required immediate attention. I scheduled a conference call with the board's Risk Management Committee to discuss it. The call became an intense grilling of SH Lee, by members of the committee, on how exactly our Hynix exposure had come about and how it had grown so far beyond the house limit.

It turned out that Hynix had been a longstanding customer of KFB, but the bank's credit exposure to it had been managed down to about 100 billion won by November 2000. That same month, Citibank in Seoul led a syndicated loan—a loan made by a group of banks—of 800 billion won to Hynix. Citibank and its investment banking subsidiary, Salomon Smith Barney, pitched the loan to several banks in Seoul, including KFB. It was a tough sell—all the foreign banks had passed on the deal—but the management of KFB decided to join the syndicate for 100 billion won, which, added to the previous loans and accrued interest, pushed the total credit exposure to Hynix to about 250 billion won.

The problem turned out to be even worse than the headline numbers indicated. Much of KFB's loan exposure was not secured by any collateral. Hynix, it turned out, was going to require more than $4 billion to be bailed out. If the company went under or ceased operation, the entire amount of our unsecured Hynix exposure would be worthless. Whatever value that might be salvaged by selling off Hynix's assets would go to paying off secured debt owners first, likely leaving nothing for holders of unsecured paper.

Hynix got into trouble because of a worldwide collapse in the semiconductor market. The price of dynamic random-access memory chips, or DRAM, had fallen 90 percent in 2001. The semiconductor industry, a highly cyclical business, dived into a down cycle with no respite in sight. Those companies without sufficient cash reserves were at risk of running out of liquidity and failing. At this point, if all lenders or creditor banks had stopped lending to Hynix and called back their loans, the company would go out of business immediately. In fact, if even one of the creditors pulled the plug, the company was likely to fail.

I pictured a group of people about to be crushed by a giant boulder. They were trying to survive by coming together to hold it up with all their collective strength. If one person jumped out of the way, he would probably live, but the rest would surely become meat pies. In this case, even if the banks tried to rescue Hynix by loaning more money to it, there was no telling if the company would survive. It could be throwing good money after bad. The banks had to make a collective decision about what to do or not to do.

Hynix's largest lender, the government-controlled Korea Exchange Bank, requested that all Hynix's creditor banks sign an intercreditor agreement by which if 75 percent of the creditors made a decision to provide new money, all signatories of the agreement would be obligated to follow. We were astonished to learn that KFB had also become a member of this agreement without the board's knowledge. Our management had signed away the bank's autonomy in this matter without notifying the board.

There wasn't anything we could do. Hynix was not yet bankrupt, but we knew it would not survive unless it received another capital injection.

I arrived in Seoul on Friday, September 12, 2001, along with some other members of the KFB board. It was still September 11, 2001, in the United States, and I had just learned of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

My wife, Bin, had just arrived in London on her way to Boston, where she would meet our son, Bo, to fly to Chicago. He was going to start his freshman year at the University of Chicago. Bin did not know about the 9/11 attacks when she called me from London's Heathrow Airport. She hadn't yet seen the news, so at first she thought I was joking when I told her to immediately book a hotel in London because U.S. airspace was closed.

Newbridge had held the grand opening of its office in Tokyo on September 11, before the attacks in New York City happened. The next day, Blum, Carroll, and some others who had been in Tokyo officiating the opening continued on to Seoul. As I prepared for our meeting, the events of the previous day in the United States hung heavily in my mind, and I was not looking forward to discussing the bank's problems in the midst of this tragedy.

It was under such circumstances that we opened the meeting of KFB's board of directors at about 2 pm on September 13. Bonderman called in by phone because he was stuck in Fort Worth, Texas, where it was already midnight his time. The only significant agenda item was the Hynix loan. We board members had been struggling to consider its financial ramifications and how we might get off the hook before the crisis fully unfolded. We were, therefore, all surprised that our CEO, Horie, had invited the CEO of Hynix and a banker from Salomon Smith Barney to join the meeting to make a pitch for new money and to swap our debt into equity. Other Korean banks, led by the government-controlled Korea Exchange Bank, were proposing to do the same.

The CEO of Hynix and the Salomon banker took turns going through their presentation. They argued that Hynix would recover if the semiconductor cycle turned and chip prices began to rise. Their argument struck me as pure tautology. Essentially, they were arguing that if Hynix got out its financial trouble, its debt would be paid. But they managed to deliver their pitch with a straight face, so maybe they had convinced themselves their argument had substance. At this point, Hynix was $6 billion in debt and still losing money. The other Korean banks were contemplating swapping $2.3 billion of debt into equity as part of a $4.4 billion bailout package.

The board listened attentively but was not reassured. It was obvious that the Hynix CEO and the Salomon banker were avoiding talking about the other possibility, that DRAM chip prices would continue to fall and the company would declare bankruptcy after burning through all the new money it aimed to raise. The odds were already stacked against KFB recovering the money it had sunk into Hynix. We were dismayed that our own CEO had the audacity to ask the board to approve even more credit to the troubled firm.

Finally, Bonderman, talking over the speakerphone, cut the Hynix team short. He said that semiconductor prices could fall further or stay depressed and that whatever new money we put into the company could disappear together with the old. Surprisingly, the CEO of Hynix and the Salomon representative had nothing to say in their own defense. It was as if they had never considered that possibility. The board meeting did not adjourn until after 7 pm, which was 5 am for Bonderman. He had stayed up all night to participate in the discussion, as the matter facing us was grave and critical.

KFB would not participate in the Hynix bailout, the board decided, even if it meant it had to sell its Hynix debt to other banks at a steep discount and take a punishingly large haircut on the loans. We thought it was better to lose some of our hair than our head.

Back at the Shilla Hotel, the Newbridge people, Blum, Carroll, Chen, Poon, and I, met with Barnum and Robert Cohen to talk about what to do with the management of KFB. We all agreed that they should be held accountable for the Hynix debacle. Some heads would need to roll. We needed to further improve our system of risk controls and to tighten up the bank's internal processes to prevent this from ever happening again.

We retained a Washington, DC, law firm, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering (WCP), to conduct an independent inquiry into the events that had led to the Hynix credit decisions.

About a month later, WCP delivered its report. Through a forensic audit of the bank's activities, it found that KFB had gradually been reducing its credit exposure to Hynix, in accordance with the house limit established by the board in September 2000. However, in late November of that year, this trend reversed when KFB management authorized its 100 billion won participation in the Citibank syndicated loan. According to a document the WCP investigation unearthed, the plan was to reduce overall exposure to Hynix from 100 billion won to 61.6 billion won by the end of 2000 and to zero by May 2001—excluding the 100 billion won from the syndicated loan. Why on earth did KFB management authorize participation in the Citibank loan when it wanted to reduce the credit exposure to Hynix simultaneously? “The decision to join the syndication was principally that of the CEO,” the WCP report found.

Although the CEO recalls that his endorsement of the proposal was expressly stated as being subject to the credit assessment of the CCO [chief credit officer, SH Lee] and the KFB credit team, the CEO's enthusiasm was clear and, sensing that, the CCO and the subordinate credit team largely deferred to it.

For his part, the CCO acknowledges that he was aware of the liquidity and DRAM pricing risks … and also of a reluctance by foreign lenders (other than Citibank) to participate in the proposed syndication. He also acknowledges that this information should have given him pause. But he deferred to the CEO and so acknowledges.



This illustrated a cultural norm that was prevalent in Korea—one that Malcolm Gladwell wrote about in his book Outliers. He describes a 1997 plane crash to explain the dangers of this phenomenon. Korean Air flight 801 crashed into a hillside in the U.S. territory of Guam, killing 228 people. Gladwell attributes the crash to an element in Korean culture, that of juniors or subordinates deferring to their superiors, even when the risks of doing so are high. This deference prevented the first officer and the flight engineer from pointing out that the captain was on a crash course.

I don't believe that any flight crew, Korean or otherwise, would keep quiet in the face of clear, life-threatening danger. It was more likely, as the official investigation concluded, that the first officer and flight engineer had been so deferential to the captain that they failed to monitor and cross-check the approach he chose. In any case, nobody can possibly know if the two subordinates or the captain were aware of the danger, or what went through their heads, because they did not live to be interviewed.

At KFB, however, our chief credit officer was very much alive. He and his credit team confirmed to the investigators that they went along with the loan despite their reservations, in deference to the CEO. Nobody was killed, but the bank lost about $200 million, which almost wiped out all the profits the bank had made in the previous year. This aspect of the Korean culture had obviously interfered with the kind of credit culture we were trying to build at KFB. It hadn't occurred to us that our management team could be so strongly influenced by the Korean culture because Horie was an American and Lee was trained at Bank of America.

WCP's report concluded that the extent of the CEO's involvement in Hynix decisions was “inconsistent with reasonable expectations of the Board.” He had deviated from the bank's mission to shift from chaebol lending to consumer banking, breached the board's risk management guidelines, and erred by becoming personally involved in credit decisions. Clearly, the chief executive officer was responsible for the losses. WCP also found the CCO's acquiescence, despite believing the Hynix loan to be a bad decision, was “inconsistent with the Board's reasonable expectation of his assigned role.” It made us wonder how big a problem we had.

The report wrapped up by stating

WCP also believes it appropriate to acknowledge that, however large and egregious, Hynix is an exception rather than the rule. Both the CEO and the chief credit officer believe that the management has been effective in reducing KFB's overall exposures to most other major corporate clients. KFB had eight borrowers, other than Hynix, that exceeded the “House Limits” in February 2001. The chief credit officer reports that this number is now down to four. In addition, he reports that KFB has decreased its exposure to each of these borrowers.



The findings by WCP spoke for themselves. The CEO took full responsibility and resigned. The board accepted his resignation. The CCO shared responsibility for not having provided a check on the CEO's preferences. But the board, recognizing that SH Lee had done a good job controlling credit quality when given full credit authority, did not feel that he should be held too harshly accountable for the breakdown of our risk management system. Lee was reprimanded but kept in his position. We felt quite sure he had learned a good and hard lesson.
