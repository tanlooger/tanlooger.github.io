title: 3 White Knight

We didn't know it at the time, but one of the reasons we seemed to be getting along so well with our new friends at the FSC was that negotiations between the government and the other banks had bogged down.

Chairman Lee of the FSC later recounted the situation in his memoir:

The market was chilly. Nobody wanted to buy the banks. I knocked on the doors of more than 40 foreign banks following the advice of Morgan Stanley. Citibank suggested it would want to buy 100 good branches of Korea First Bank. If so, who would buy the remaining ones? … HSBC, the only interested bank, showed nerve. But they were so arrogant. They required put-back options and also said, “We will own 100 percent of the shares.” … The government argued “We have to hold at least 40 percent of the shares.” But HSBC insisted “no more than 20 percent.”



As we learned, even the 20 percent of equity that HSBC was prepared to let the government own came with conditions. HSBC wanted the right, known as a call option, to purchase the remaining 20 percent after four years, at the bank's net asset value. In normal times, banks trade at a premium to net asset value; such a call option would have left the government without much upside. Morgan Stanley was pushing the government to accept HSBC's proposal as the only credible one, and the government was desperately in need of a way out.

The government was counting on Newbridge to make an acceptable bid. We were prepared to engage immediately once the FSC shifted its attention to Newbridge. Although we had no knowledge of the proposals made by Citibank and HSBC, our bid, which included a 49 percent ownership stake for the government, was looking more appealing. The English edition of JoongAng Ilbo, a major Korean newspaper, explained the Korean government's perspective in a special report a few years later:

Newbridge's Weijian Shan visited the Financial Supervisory Commission and offered a dossier on a plan to normalize Korea First Bank. “We know what the Korean government thinks. We will have a 51 percent stake. And the government takes the other 49 percent,” Mr. Shan told commission officials. Newbridge read the Korean government's mind.



In fact, nobody told us what the government was thinking, nor were we clairvoyant. However, we knew there would not be a deal unless the government could sell it to the Korean public. A lot of taxpayer money—5.1 trillion won (about $4.25 billion) by then—had been poured into the two banks to save them. If an investor bought 100 percent of the bank, the government could only report to the public how much taxpayers' money it would lose—not only how much had already been put into the banks, but also the additional costs of buying back the remaining bad loans. The public wanted to know how much money the taxpayers would get back if the bank was turned around. The HSBC deal didn't leave much room for good news.

Our proposed deal would let the government invest on a pari passu basis, or on equal footing with us, for about half of the equity, which would allow it—and taxpayers—to capture about half of the future gain. It is understandable that a bank such as HSBC would want to control 100 percent of a subsidiary. But there were ways to structure a deal so that the investor would retain a preemptive right to acquire the shares owned by the government at fair market value after the bank was turned around. Such a structure would allow both parties to achieve their objectives. The politics seemed so obvious that we had never thought of a deal structure that would deny the government upside from a successful turnaround. It was surprising that none of our competitors could see this.

After our meeting at the FSC, Dr. Sung-hun Kim, Dong-soo Chin's deputy, became our interlocutor representing the FSC. I met with him again six days later, on December 17, to discuss the terms of our investment over dinner at the Japanese restaurant in Seoul's Hilton Hotel, where I was staying. Our advisor, Jihong Kim, joined us. Dr. Kim questioned me on our terms, and I explained the rationale for each of them. I listened to his responses, including his reasons for objecting to some of them. In the end, we narrowed the gap between us considerably. It was a helpful, candid conversation, and I came away from it feeling that we had built trust with the government. Dr. Kim concluded the meeting by saying “I hope we sign an MOU by the end of the year.”

An MOU, or memorandum of understanding, would not be a binding contract, but it would contain the basic terms of an agreement and it would give Newbridge the exclusive right to negotiate further with the government. As much as I shared his hope, with just two weeks left in the year, we had a lot of ground to cover.

Unknowingly, Newbridge had become a “white knight” in the government's search for a buyer of its failed banks. In private equity business, the term “white knight” refers to an acquirer who comes in late but offers a better and more friendly deal to the seller. At that particular moment, we had no idea what terms that HSBC and Citibank had offered to the government. But, from the perspective of the government, our proposal was clearly more attractive than those from either of the two large global banking institutions.

The next day, the FSC was in touch to reiterate that they could agree to one year of unlimited put rights, but not the two years we had asked for. Bonderman thought a one-year put, in addition to the right to remove all the bad assets prior to closing, was acceptable. I was still concerned that we would not be able to identify all the hidden bad loans and assets within one year. If the economic crisis was prolonged, there was no telling how many legacy loans could go bad.

I decided to insist on a two-year put right, but, as a compromise, we would agree not to sell back loans exceeding a certain percentage of the loan book in the second year, based on our confidence that even if we missed some hidden bad loans in our initial due diligence, they would not represent a significant percentage of the total. For every loan we put back to the government, though, the government would be required to pay its original book value, 100 cents on the dollar, plus accrued interest. I asked Jihong to explain all this to the FSC and let them know that shortening the put period was not necessarily in their best interest. Loan quality was expected to improve as the economy recovered, which would likely take more than one year. The longer the put period, the fewer loans might eventually be put back because the bank would be given more time to work out a questionable loan, which ultimately would reduce the cost to the government.

Jihong Kim went to meet with the FSC’s Chairman Lee on the afternoon of Friday, December 18, just as I was flying back to Hong Kong for the weekend. I received a call from Jihong as soon as I landed. He said that Lee was receptive to our proposal and had also spoken with his team about it.

The FSC, Jihong explained, would accept Newbridge's put condition if the post-close rights were exercised “with proper procedures.” For example, the loans could be transferred back to the government only after the bank had sent several demand notices requesting payment from borrowers and had gone through other legal procedures. The bank would be expected to roll over regularly performing loans at maturity, unless it had specific reasons to refuse the roll-over of loans. That was not a problem for us. From our point of view, the bank would have every incentive to keep a performing loan because it was an earning asset. A bank's business was to make loans so we would want to get rid of a loan only if it clearly could not be recollected.

We seemed to have cleared a major hurdle. Dan Carroll and I worked over the weekend to revise the term sheet, which we completed on the morning of Tuesday, December 22. We faxed it to the FSC that afternoon, just before my colleague Daniel Poon and I flew to Seoul from Hong Kong. Our flight was practically empty; there were few business travelers so close to Christmas. I did not know where negotiations between the government and HSBC stood at that point, but I assumed Westerners would not want to work over Christmas holiday, so the FSC team could concentrate all their attention on us. It felt like Santa was on our side.

We again stayed at the Hilton in downtown Seoul, and the FSC team decided to hold our meetings there for the purpose of secrecy. This sale was inevitably going to be a high-profile affair in Korea. The press was sniffing around for any signs of progress to report. Newbridge and the FSC did not want our teams to be seen together, as neither side wanted a premature leak.

Dr. Kim and his team arrived at the Hilton the next morning at 9:30. On our side were myself, Jihong Kim, Daniel Poon, and David Kim from Lehman Brothers. We began by going through the term sheet, line by line, very slowly and carefully. At first, we avoided the major issues, trying to narrow the gap between us by resolving smaller and easier ones instead. We did not finish our meeting until about 10 pm, and there was still a lot of work ahead of us.

The next day would be Christmas Eve. Since I could not go home, my wife, Bin, our son Bo, who was 15, and our daughter LeeAnn, who was seven, flew to Seoul to join me. I was so happy to see them, but I could not spare much time for them. Bin and I always tried to emphasize to our children the importance of a strong work ethic, so Bin used me to set an example. “Putting bread on the table for the family isn't easy,” Bin lectured Bo. “Look at how hard your dad works!” But if I'm honest, putting bread on the table wasn't my motivation. I was driven by the thrill of this opportunity—and beating our rivals. It was all consuming; I could barely focus on anything else.

We continued to negotiate the term sheet with the FSC, picking up where we had left off the previous night. Since we were getting reasonably close, Dr. Kim asked us to decide which of the two banks, Korea First Bank (KFB) or Seoul Bank, we proposed to buy.

Our team had only two members, Daniel Poon and myself, camped out in Seoul, along with David Kim from Lehman. We decided to divide our limited forces. Poon and David Kim went to check out the two banks and I continued to negotiate the term sheet with Dr. Kim and his team. Only 25 years old, Daniel was the youngest member of our team. But he was highly analytical and meticulous. Almost nothing escaped his sharp eye when it came to due diligence or documentation. He also had excellent judgment.

It was now a race with HSBC to see who could reach an agreement with the government first. We understood that they had a team of 20 people on the ground conducting due diligence, looking through as many loans as they could, document by document, in order to get a sense of the health of both banks. We had also heard, although we could not verify it, that HSBC was willing to absorb 20 percent of the losses on any bad loans discovered after the deal closed. Given that HSBC needed to be able to identify not only every bad loan but also every potential bad loan before closing, they had set themselves up for a massive amount of work; there were tens of thousands of loans across the two banks.

Our strategy was different. My thinking was that diving into loan-level due diligence without knowing if we could strike a reasonable deal was a waste of time, manpower, and resources. Our proposed deal would be subject to due diligence, to be completed after signing the MOU, and, under our terms, we would be able to transfer all the bad loans and assets to the government after closing, so there was no need to do all our due diligence before the MOU. That allowed our team, small as it was, to remain fully focused on negotiations with the FSC. In fact, we were all but monopolizing the FSC's time, leaving our competitor HSBC with no counterpart to negotiate with. I couldn't help but gloat a bit. It was obvious that we had the government's full attention and that it was making a serious effort to reach an agreement with us by the year-end deadline.

In reality, of course, we were never in control of the negotiation pace; the FSC team must have felt it had a better chance to reach a deal with us, and faster, than with anyone else. Our willingness to accommodate the government's wishes to meet the deadline also made a difference.

* * *

On the morning of Christmas Eve I spent an hour on the phone with David Bonderman, updating him on the negotiations and getting his guidance on the remaining issues. Then I met Dr. Kim and his team in a conference room on the 19th floor of the Hilton. Following Bonderman's suggestion, I proposed that after the bank was purged of its bad loans and assets, it would issue two types of shares, common and preferred, to both the investor and the government, as consideration for the capital we both would invest. I proposed that the split between preferred stock and common be 60:40, with Newbridge owning 51 percent of each and the government, 49 percent. Unlike common stock, preferred typically does not have voting rights, but its dividend takes priority over that of common stock.

We also offered the government warrants, the option to buy 5 percent more of each type of share issued by the bank at a future date, at a predetermined price. Via the warrants, the government would own 49 percent of the shares outright but would stand to capture another 5 percent of the upside if the shares' value rose higher than the strike price of the warrants. (The warrants were exercisable only at the time of our exit, so the government would not own more than 49 percent of the shares of the bank at any time.) Bonderman's idea was meant to give the government a better share of the upside. The warrants would dilute our own gains, but he was a big-picture man. Bonderman liked to say “In the scheme of things, this won't matter to us.”

The idea had not come up before, and was probably unnecessary to bring the parties closer, but we felt it would build goodwill and trust. Sure enough, Dr. Kim was pleased by our offer, but once the door was opened, the government demanded more warrants.

Another major point of discussion involved reaching agreement on the yield on the government note, the interest-bearing IOU to the bank, issued by the government to fill the hole left by the carved-out bad assets. Owing the bank and paying interest on the money owed would be mutually beneficial to the government and to Newbridge. The government was so strapped for cash that it was in its best interest to postpone any payments. For the bank, taking the government note was much better than taking cash because the note would earn interest.

It was agreed that the note's interest rate would be set at 250 basis points (2.5 percent) over the average cost of the bank's interest-bearing liabilities (i.e., deposits, or any other borrowings on which the bank would pay interest), giving the bank an effective 250-basis point margin above its cost of funds. In the context of the economic crisis, this margin was low, but we considered it fair because the government's IOU was virtually risk free. The probability of a government defaulting on a domestic debt obligation is practically nil, because in the worst case it can always print money. I was pleased as it seemed major issues were being resolved. Indeed, I was beginning to feel merry.

Meanwhile, Poon and David Kim returned, late in the afternoon, fresh from visiting the two banks up for sale. The decision was not hard. In some ways the banks were quite similar, confirming our impression from the initial teasers sent by Morgan Stanley. They were similar in terms of total assets, number of employees, and the bad loan ratio. They were both centered in Seoul with branches scattered across the country. But after meeting both management teams, Poon and David Kim suggested that we choose Korea First Bank. They felt that not only had KFB a stronger brand, a stronger branch network, and a longer operating history, its management actually had a plan for the future and was working to right the foundering bank.

Since our deal structure required the target bank's balance sheet be cleaned up by the government, the volume of bad loans was less important to us than the quality of the franchise, and Newbridge felt KFB's quality was stronger. I also thought the name was more appealing: The name “Korea First” immediately suggested a nationwide institution of some prestige, whereas the name “Seoul Bank” could be misunderstood to mean some local city bank. We decided right there and then to pick KFB. It took us less time to decide which bank to buy than it usually would take a family to decide which car to purchase. But this was an unusual situation, and there was no time to hesitate.

I called Dr. Kim to let him know our choice. The FSC agreed that, if the negotiations were successful, we could buy KFB. Ultimately, the government did not care very much who bought which bank, and it was willing to accommodate our wishes on a first-come, first-served basis. I was glad that we moved fast and decisively. The FSC told us that, later that same day, HSBC indicated to the government that it, too, wanted to buy KFB, but they were told it was too late.

Korea has had a long history, dating back to antiquity. In much of its ancient history, the land was divided among warring states and occasionally unified as one kingdom, such as the Shilla (AD 668–935) and the Goryeo, from which the English name “Korea” was derived (918–1392).

The Korean peninsula is strategically positioned between China, Russia, and Japan (see Exhibit 1), and for centuries its sovereignty was under constant threat. Japan invaded in 1592 and again in 1597. Both times, Japanese troops were repelled by the joint forces of Korea and China. In 1894, the king appealed to the Chinese government for help to put down a rebellion. Japan, with its long-held ambitions for Korea, was not invited but sent troops anyway. After the rebellion was quelled, Japan refused to leave, fought a war with China, and won. As a result, Korea ceased to be a vassal state of China and came under Japanese occupation. In 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea. The colonial rulers were known not only for their brutality but also for their systematic effort to erase Korea's national identity and culture.

After the Japanese surrender in 1945 at the end of World War II, the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Soviet Union in the north and the United States in the south, along the 38th Parallel. On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out when North Korea invaded the South in an attempt to reunify the country. The United States entered the war and pushed the North Koreans all the way to Yalu River, which borders China. China intervened and eventually fought the US forces to a stalemate back at the 38th Parallel, which stands to this day under an armistice signed on July 27, 1953.

Korea First Bank was one of the country's largest and oldest banks. It was founded in 1929, during the Japanese colonial era, as Chosun Savings Bank. It was listed on the Korean Stock Exchange in 1957 and by the end of the decade had come under the control of Samsung Group. It changed its name to Korea First Bank in 1958. In 1962, it was nationalized along with other commercial banks by Chung-hee Park, leader of the military coup that had taken power in 1961. During Park's authoritarian regime, which lasted until his assassination in 1979, he rallied the nation's energies and resources toward a series of antipoverty and industrialization campaigns. In pursuit of industrialization, the government tightly controlled access to credit, subsidizing loans to favored industries in close coordination with business leaders.

In 1971, KFB was the first Korean commercial bank to open an overseas office, allowing it to borrow from abroad. Korea's domestic savings were far below desired levels, so foreign capital was key to economic growth. In the 1980s, KFB became known for innovation. It was the first commercial bank to computerize all its internal systems and one of the first banks to introduce credit cards and automatic teller machines in Korea. In 1982, KFB was reprivatized as part of the government's economic liberalization efforts.

By the early 1990s, it was among the most profitable Korean commercial banks, with some of the country's largest and most influential companies among its clients. It was the lead bank for such big chaebols as LG Group, SK Group, and Daewoo Group. Loans to the top five chaebols, including also Hyundai and Samsung, accounted for 65 percent of KFB's portfolio.

By the middle of the decade, it emerged as Korea's largest integrated financial group. In addition to commercial banking, KFB had subsidiaries engaged in securities, derivatives, leasing, and investment consulting. By the end of 1996, KFB's total assets stood at $40.7 billion (34.6 trillion won), and the bank had 8,321 employees, 421 domestic branches, and 17 overseas branches and offices. It was considered to be one of Korea's crown jewels.

But in 1997, the go-go growth strategy that had allowed KFB to become so large began to unravel. In January a major borrower, the Hanbo Group, collapsed, brought down in part by a bribery scandal that exposed widespread corruption and weakness among some of Korea's largest companies. Amid the ensuing turmoil, six other chaebols either filed for financial assistance or sought protection from the commercial banks. KFB installed a new president, Shee-yul Ryoo, the former deputy governor of the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank. But by this point the Asian financial crisis was in full swing; KFB's shortage of capital overwhelmed Ryoo's best attempts at restructuring it. In the end, Ryoo simply ran out of time.

As chaebols continued to fail, KFB's bad loans exploded. During the first half of 1997, the bank had about $3.2 billion in nonperforming or impaired loans—approximately 17 percent of its total loans—and reported a net loss of $417 million (356.5 billion won), 10 times its year-earlier loss of $42.7 million (34.6 billion won). International rating agencies downgraded KFB's debt, reflecting the bank's deteriorating asset quality and the heightened risks Korean banks faced as corporate defaults continued to mount.

In October, as Korea's economic situation worsened, the government offered special loans to the nation's capital-starved commercial banks to forestall a meltdown in the financial sector. On December 3, 1997, just one day before the IMF bailout was announced, KFB's bad loan problem became public knowledge and the Korean government had to decide whether to let KFB fail or bail it out. Many analysts and bankers stated that the bank should be closed outright.

Daniel Poon flew back to Hong Kong on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. I decided to stay in Seoul to get the deal sealed up. David Kim from Lehman and a lawyer from Cleary, S.K. Kang, worked with me to revise the term sheet to reflect the points we'd agreed on with Dr. Kim earlier that day, and then I stepped out for a run.

It was an unusually warm winter day and the run was pleasant. About halfway through, my mobile phone rang. It was Jihong Kim, our advisor.

There's been a change, Jihong said.

Lehman's chief representative in Seoul was Kunho Cho. He was not much involved in our deal discussions but somehow, unbeknownst to me, he had met with Chairman Lee earlier that day and indicated that Newbridge would be willing both to accept loan-loss sharing and to increase the number of warrants granted to the government. I was disturbed to hear this, and suddenly felt a lot less merry. I had not expected to be undercut at the 11th hour, by our own financial advisor, no matter how well intentioned Cho had been.

It was awkward, but I had to call Dr. Kim to explain that Cho was not involved in our internal deliberations and what he had said did not accurately represent our position. In the end, Dr. Kim accepted my explanation, but I was working until very late on Christmas Eve, while my family went out to celebrate.

Christmas is the second biggest holiday in South Korea, after the Lunar New Year. Despite being a Confucian society by tradition and culture, South Korea is about 30 percent Christian. Although the country was facing its worst economic crisis since after the Korean War, all the buildings were brightly lit, and all the shop windows were adorned with colorful ornaments. The streets were packed with traffic as merrymakers drove from party to party. From the windows of my hotel room, I could see Seoul's buildings covered in festive, bright lights. Below, cars filled the streets in every direction. Bin and our children tried to go to a skating rink that was, peculiarly, inside a shopping mall, but the traffic was so bad they gave up and came back to the hotel.

* * *

Bright and early on Christmas morning, I received a fax from Bonderman, asking me to halt negotiations and call him immediately.

He was perturbed that the deal might not work for us anymore after the compromises I had made. I thought I had been careful, and I would never make a material concession without internal consensus, and especially without his consent. But small concessions could add up, and, from a distance, Bonderman was worried that the deal might have materially changed from our initial proposal. I updated him on what had transpired in our negotiations the previous day. He suggested that we regroup via a conference call to make sure that we were all on the same page before proceeding further.

The call was scheduled for late in the evening Christmas Day, so I spent some time with my family. Bin and I took the children to Lotte World, a huge indoor amusement park in Seoul. The place was so packed with children that it was hard to imagine that South Korea was in the throes of an economic crisis, but despite the crowds we had a great time. We ended an enjoyable Christmas Day with dinner at the teppanyaki counter of the Hilton's Japanese restaurant.

After the children had gone to sleep, I headed upstairs to the conference room to join the conference call. On the line were the members of our team, including Carroll, Chen, and Poon; the Lehman team, led by Erlanger; and the Cleary team, led by Michael Ryan. We were all in different places and in different time zones, and it was Christmas Day for all of us, which we were supposed to be celebrating with our families. Still, united by the project at hand, we methodically worked through each item on the term sheet and laid out the outstanding issues. It took us until 1 am, Seoul time, to finish.

The next morning, I returned to the 19th-floor conference room and phoned Bonderman. Although he hadn't been on the previous evening's call, he had been briefed by Erlanger. Overall, Bonderman was satisfied with where we stood. His only suggestion was regarding the government note, which we expected in return for the troubled loans we would be moving over to the bad bank. Bonderman suggested we extend the maturity of the government note beyond three years if its size was greater than $6 billion. He was concerned that if the government paid back the note before the economy improved, we might not be able to turn the cash into new loans quickly enough. It would be costly for the bank to hold cash, which would not earn interest (to cover the costs of its liabilities), whereas the government note would pay us 2.5 percent over the bank's average cost of funds. By proposing to extend the term, Bonderman meant to give us more time to grow our loan book based on our judgment about the timing and strength of Korea's economic recovery.

After lunch, Bin and our children went with Jihong's wife and children to Yongpyong, a popular ski resort about a two and a half hour drive east of Seoul. I so wished I could go with them, but duty wouldn't allow me. My disappointment was tempered by the fact that I knew, before they arrived, that work would consume most of my time. Even though I couldn't join them, I was happy that they could find something fun to do. Jihong Kim, David Kim, and I headed for the FSC's office to meet with our negotiator, Dr. Kim. As this was a holiday, the FSC's office was empty except for us.

The meeting began at about 2 pm and ground forward as we painstakingly reexamined each of the terms. I did most of the talking, while David Kim took notes. We negotiated late into the night. The FSC officials certainly earned my respect. They were professional, dedicated, and hardworking, no less so than our side. They fought hard for everything and did not give up until they had pushed us to the limit. We once again went through the terms one by one, eventually reaching agreement on all of them.

At the last minute, Dr. Kim requested an increase in the warrants we'd agreed to grant the government. In my opinion, we had already been unduly generous in offering them at all. After a drawn-out discussion, I reluctantly agreed to increase the warrants on the preferred shares from 5 percent to 5.5 percent. Dr. Kim gave me a look of incredulity and reproach—how stingy can you be?—but he did not push further.

As the night wore on, David Kim, who had not slept much for days, began to noticeably nod off. We finally finished at about half past midnight and I retreated to my hotel, while an exhausted David Kim still had to back to his office to revise the term sheet based on the results of our negotiations and to send the latest revisions to Bonderman and other members of our team.

The next morning, relieved to have some family time, Jihong and I took off for Yongpyong ski resort, arriving in time for lunch with our families. Yongpyong, which means Dragon Valley, is the best-known and largest ski resort in South Korea; it even hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. Yongpyong spanned four peaks and more than a dozen lifts. There were trails for skiers of all levels, which was good for me. No one in our family was an experienced skier, so we planned to stick to the less difficult runs and just have fun. Dragon Peak, the tallest of the resort, was nearly a mile above sea level. It was for advanced skiers, but we all admired the stunning backdrop it provided. Breathing in the icy air, I could feel the stress of the negotiations began to subside, and I was eager to hit the slopes.

After lunch, I rented some ski gear, but just as I headed for the lift to make my first run of the day, Bonderman called, quite upset. The term sheet was far worse than the previous day, he said. He would not agree to follow through with the deal.

This was perplexing to me because I did not think the terms were any worse, so I wondered how he had gotten that impression. But before I could ask him to clarify, the battery on my phone died, drained by the cold weather, leaving me scrambling to find a landline and call him back.

By the time I got in touch, I had also taken another look at the term sheet David Kim had typed up after the previous night's meeting. I discovered a number of mistakes in his notes, no doubt made as he was sleepily typing on his laptop. In a couple of places, the sleep-deprived Lehman banker had nodded off, literally typing a string of zzzz's. In some places, the language was unclear and ambiguous. For example, during the negotiations we had agreed that, after the government had replaced KFB’s bad assets with cash or government securities and turned it into a clean bank, both Newbridge and the government would recapitalize the bank by putting in money in agreed-upon proportions. But our revised terms sheet read as if the government would simply receive shares without paying for them. No wonder Bonderman was nonplussed.

I abandoned all hope of skiing that day. Working from our hotel room at the resort, I carefully reworked the term sheet to reflect what I had agreed upon with Dr. Kim the night before. Then I wrote a long note to explain the changes. In keeping with my bad luck that day, our hotel did not have a fax machine, so Jihong Kim had to drive me to another hotel to fax the lengthy documents to Bonderman. Then I emailed the same documents to the rest of the team, including our advisors. It was past midnight by the time I finished.

The next morning, December 28, dawned clear and beautiful. I took the family out skiing under blue skies and bright sunshine. The air was crisp and being with Bin and our children in the snow-covered mountains filled me with joy. We arranged for our daughter LeeAnn to have lessons with a Swiss ski instructor who spoke good English. I was so pleased that LeeAnn soon learned to go up the lift and ski down on her own. By the end of the day, she was arguably the best skier in our family, despite being only seven years old.

But the deal went on. After a morning on the mountain and lunch at the hotel, I spent the rest of the afternoon on a conference call with Bonderman and others. When we finished, it was about 2 am in Colorado, where Bonderman was, and 4 am on the U.S. East Coast, where other members of the team were working. Before we finished the call, I said to Bonderman, “David, don't freak out when you see something wrong. It stresses me out. Just call me and we will fix it.”

All of us were working nonstop that holiday season to move the project forward. I thought to myself there was no way HSBC could possibly compete with us to meet the government's year-end deadline, which was only three days away. Our team had an intensely strong work dynamic and we were far nimbler than most of our corporate competitors, so we were able to have productive discussions and make decisions in real time, even during Christmas. I had worked in two major banks in my previous life, the World Bank and JP Morgan. I knew the bureaucracy of a large bank would not allow efficient decision making on a major project like this. I was confident we would be able to beat HSBC to the finish line.

I called Dr. Kim that afternoon and promised that I would send him our revised term sheet the next morning. He told me the government was prepared to sign the MOU on December 30.

Despite his words and intention, it would not be a smooth ride to the finish line.

The next morning, December 29, David Kim faxed Dr. Kim the revised term sheet. I was skiing with my family, when, shortly before 11 am, someone at the FSC called Jihong, requesting that I immediately return to Seoul. Jihong and I left together at about 6 pm to drive back. On the way, I called Philip Gilligan of White & Case (W&C), the law firm advising the government. I learned that, at the advice of W&C, the FSC had raised a number of issues with the term sheet and suggested several changes. Negotiations would be tough once I got back to Seoul.

Once again we met Dr. Kim and his team in the 19th-floor boardroom of the Hilton, at about 9 pm. David Kim and Jihong joined me on our side. We discussed each of the terms revised by W&C, about seven or eight of which I considered to be outright deal breakers. For example, in our original term sheet, we had included a drag-along right, which would allow Newbridge to sell the shares of the bank owned by the government, on behalf of the government, when we sold our own. Literally, it would “drag along” the government into the sale we would be able to negotiate. This clause would be critical for when we ultimately sold the bank. Many buyers, especially other banks, would be interested in acquiring 100 percent of the company. If we could deliver only the portion that Newbridge owned, we might not be able to attract the best buyers, nor get the best price. The lawyers from W&C had removed this clause.

I explained to Dr. Kim that the drag-along was critical for both sides to be able to maximize value of the investment. But the FSC had its own concerns. “What if you sell too cheaply and take the capital to invest in something more profitable?” Dr. Kim asked.

I tried to assuage his fears. “That could not happen,” I said. In the private equity business, we only got to invest the capital from our fund once. When an investment was sold or realized, we had to give the proceeds back to our limited partners. Once a fund was fully invested, we had to raise another in order to make further investments. Usually, we would not be able to recycle the capital. Because Newbridge, as the manager of the capital provided by our investors, received a cut of the profit made from investing each fund, we would not exit from an investment until we thought the growth potential had peaked and we had maximized our return. There was every incentive for us to maximize the return on each investment.

Finally, Dr. Kim accepted my reasoning, and we kept our drag-along right, but we spent three hours on that term alone.

There were compromises on both sides, and the negotiations took hours. Finally, sometime after 8 am on December 30, we reached agreement once again on all major issues. We adjourned the meeting so Dr. Kim could go back to check with his own people at the FSC to see if they could reach internal agreement on the changed terms.

Meanwhile, I called Erlanger of Lehman to consult with him on the changes. Then I called Ryan to get the Cleary lawyers' take. Finally, I called Bonderman to update him. He was agreeable, with two major exceptions: One, we must insist that the government exercise all its warrants at the time of our exit. Two, we had to be able to put the bank's nonperforming loans to the government in a timely manner.

After a quick shower I headed to the FSC with Jihong to meet with Chairman Lee. In our negotiations so far, the chairman had been stiff and formal—in fact, I had never seen him smile. But I could tell he was pleased with our progress, and I sensed that he wanted the deal to be reached before the year was out as much as I did.

President Dae-jung Kim's cabinet, the Council of Ministers, met that afternoon to discuss the merits of our negotiated deal. I knew that there were only three ministers whose opinions counted: Chairman Lee of the FSC; President Kim's chief of staff; and the head of the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE). Lee and the chief of staff were both in favor; the finance minister voted against. However, I was relieved to discover that the motion to pursue a deal with Newbridge carried with a simple majority.

The opposition from MOFE wasn't entirely a surprise. I knew the ministry had made some last-minute requests to change the terms. Whereas the FSC was in charge of restructuring the banking system, MOFE was the one to provide the government funding for all the bank-bailout packages. However, I was told by the FSC officials that I did not have to accept MOFE's last-minute request unless I wished to.

Meanwhile, I had been busy exchanging draft documents among our team members and with our advisors for internal sign-off. It was not until dinnertime that I realized I had completely forgotten to have lunch that day, which was unusual for me, as I always have a good appetite.

At 9 pm, Dr. Kim and his team came to the hotel for further negotiations. For the most part they were minor details, except for the changes requested by MOFE. I had to reject all these changes, however, as we did not have any further room to concede. It was about 11 pm before we reached agreement on all the terms. I had been working on this deal without a break since Jihong and I had returned from our ski holiday more than 24 hours earlier, and I was hoping that this would be the final round of revisions before signing.

At five minutes past midnight on December 31, New Year's Eve, I circulated what I hoped was the final term sheet to our team. It felt good to have a document that seemed final and represented our weeks of work. My cover note summarized the major terms as follows:

The transacting parties would be Newbridge and “the Government of the Republic of Korea, acting through its Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Financial Supervisory Commission, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation and other agencies, as appropriate.”

At closing, KFB would retain substantially all of its performing loans, cash, investments and deposits, as well as any of its facilities and hard assets—office buildings, branches, furniture, and so on—that Newbridge wished to keep. All the nonperforming loans and assets would be transferred to the government or the “bad bank” owned by the government.

All assets and liabilities of the bank would be subject to thorough due diligence by Newbridge. Each asset and liability initially selected to remain in KFB would be “marked to market” on an individual basis by Newbridge—in other words, they would be valued based on what they were worth in the current market.

The hole in the balance sheet as a result of the transfer of the bad assets and of the mark-to-market exercise would be filled by cash or the Government Note issued by the government, in an amount sufficient to restore the balance between assets and liabilities.

The Government Note would bear an interest rate that would be not higher than 2.5 percent over the bank's own average borrowing costs and, would mature, initially, in three years.

Following an equalization of the assets and liabilities of the bank through the use of cash or the Government Note, the government and Newbridge would both make a capital contribution to recapitalize the bank, by subscribing for shares of the common stock and the preferred stock, resulting in 51 percent ownership by Newbridge and 49 percent ownership by the government.

The government would receive a warrant or an option to buy more shares of KFB, representing 5 percent of the total shares of the common stock and 5.5 percent of the preferred stock outstanding as of closing. The exercise prices for the warrants would be determined by multiplying the purchase prices of the stocks by a growth rate of 10 percent per annum compounded for the period from closing to the time of exercise.

Newbridge would be given the right to exercise sole voting rights with respect to the government's shares of the common stock, except with regard to specific issues having a material adverse economic effect on the government's interests as a shareholder.

In the first year after closing, KFB would have the right to transfer to the government an unlimited amount of loans and other assets, which were collectively defined as “Put Assets.” All such transfers would be at the original book value of the assets plus accrued interest. In the second year, KFB would have the right to transfer to the government Put Assets in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the total loans of KFB as of closing, also at original book value plus accrued interest.

There would be special treatment for the loans to top five chaebols (Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung, LG, and SK), whose transfer to the government would be unlimited, but each of the top five chaebols would be treated equally if KFB was to retain any of their loans.

The government would provide a guarantee on the principal of all the fixed income securities portfolio and on the book value of the equities portfolio retained by KFB.

KFB would retain 100 percent of all benefits resulting from all existing tax losses held by the bank at closing as well as all benefits arising from future losses recognized by KFB—in other words, future income could be offset by the amount of the accumulated losses for the purpose of computing corporate income taxes.

Newbridge would have the sole and complete right to appoint and terminate members of management and employees.

The government and Newbridge would develop a plan to ensure the stability of the bank and preserve its value during the transition period between the signing of the MOU and closing. This would potentially include some kind of joint supervisory transition team overseeing the bank as Newbridge prepared to take control.



The exclusivity of our MOU would be valid for four months, expiring May 2, which was expected to give the parties more than enough time to negotiate the final documents and to close the transaction. May 2 seemed to be in the distant future. After all, the most contentious points of negotiation had already been hashed out for the MOU. Anything that was decided there should be unlikely to change much, we thought.

By the time I'd sent off the final, final document to our team members and advisors, I had been up for 43 continuous hours, beating my previous record of 31 hours straight, which happened in my youth, when I was digging a canal in China's Gobi Desert. For some reason, however, I did not feel tired. I was exhilarated. When I bite on something, I don't let go, and this deal excited me. It seemed our persistence had paid off, and we might just have wrestled this deal to the ground.

Although I had not gotten to bed until 1 am, I got up at 6 the next day and went for my regular morning run. At breakfast, I noticed the major English-language Korean papers were reporting that the KFB sale was “making progress.” Although much of it was speculation, it was clear the press was now aware that Newbridge was the only party making headway with the government.

All morning I waited to hear from the FSC, but there was complete silence. I had no idea what was happening on the government side and didn't know whether I should worry. It was the last day of the year, the final deadline the government set for itself to sign the MOU. There was nothing more for me to do, and the energy that had sustained me through the deal making and negotiating finally faded. I dozed off. At about 10:30 am, I was awakened by a call from Jihong Kim, who said that the FSC was prepared to sign our agreement. The ceremony would be held at 1:30 that afternoon.

Elated, I began to get ready. However, Jihong called again an hour later to say there had been a snag. MOFE had another request, this time to raise the amount of the warrants we had offered the government—something we had already increased beyond what we wanted. The ministry had not been involved in the negotiations up until this point, so it was unaware of how many concessions we had already made. It seemed like a last-minute effort to squeeze as much out of us as it could. I knew that at this stage the government wasn't going to walk away over such a minor point, so I ignored it.

I arrived at the FSC building in Yeouido at 1:30 pm to find the FSC team already waiting for me. Unlike our previous meetings, the atmosphere was quite relaxed. With the tough negotiations behind us, we all felt relieved and accomplished—slightly more like colleagues than adversaries. We stood around chatting with each other, waiting for the signing ceremony to begin.

After a few minutes of chitchat, however, an FSC official drew me aside. The request to increase the warrants came directly from the finance minister, he explained. This changed things somewhat: I had to take a personal request from the minister seriously. While I knew we did not have to make any further concessions, in order to show respect to the minister I offered, as a gesture of goodwill, to increase the government's warrants for preferred shares by another half a percentage point. Fearing that another concession on my part would only invite more requests, I added that the offer was valid only for one hour, after which it would be withdrawn. The agreement was on the table, waiting to be signed, and we were literally running out of time. It was time to bring all this to an end.

The FSC team delivered my offer to Chairman Lee, who in turn talked with the minister to get his consent. It was accepted. We were all set.

At about 2 pm, Director General Dong-soo Chin and I sat down in front of the table, where a stack of documents was placed before us. We primed our pens and got started, Chin signing on behalf of the Korean government and I on behalf of Newbridge Capital. We signed the stacks in front of us, swapped piles, and signed again. The whole process took 10 minutes. After weeks of grinding work, many sleepless nights, and the stress and suspense, it was official. (See Exhibit 2.)
