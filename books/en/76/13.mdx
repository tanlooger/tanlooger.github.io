title: 13 The Final Sprint
---






We began the negotiation on the definitive documents with the KDIC at 2 pm on Thursday, November 18, in an all-hands meeting at their offices, exactly one month after our lawyers delivered the first draft to them. By now both parties had outlined the issues that we needed to resolve. Dong-il Kim, a senior officer who reported directly to Executive Director Dong-jun Paeng, was the only representative of the KDIC in the meeting. Eric Yoon of White & Case did most of the talking. Indeed, most of the discussion was between the lawyers representing the two sides. For the most part, the principals just listened. The atmosphere was friendly and the discussion constructive—but it was clear that this would be the first of several meetings needed to get us to the close.

In this first meeting, we went through all the outstanding issues one by one, and for most of them we did not reach a conclusion. The Daewoo loans, which included loans to dozens of subsidiaries of Daewoo Group, were KFB's largest problem loans, so they were a major focus of discussion. Some Daewoo subsidiaries were faring better than others, though credit support for Daewoo as a group had collapsed. What would we do with a Daewoo loan that was still performing but went bad after the closing of our transaction?

Our proposal was that if the work-out of a Daewoo loan happened after the closing, we would have the right to transfer it to the government, as we could all other nonperforming loans. However, the government side wanted us to treat Daewoo loans differently from other corporate loans, both because of their total size and because of the company's position in the Korean economy. Yoon proposed categorizing the transfer to the government of Daewoo restructured or work-out loans as “special transfer events,” which would be treated differently from all other transfers. But there was much debate, without conclusion, as to how to treat them. We adjourned without agreement at 10:30 pm, after eight and a half hours locked in KDIC's conference room.

The next day, Friday, November 19, we all met again. This time we shifted the venue to a more spacious conference room at KFB's head office. I was pleased to find the atmosphere remained friendly and relaxed even as we worked through our contested points. The two KDIC team leaders, Dong-il Kim and Jong-tae “JT” Kim, were professional, dedicated, and reasonable. We even called each other by our first names, which was unusual in a Korean business setting and had never happened before with the FSC team. They also had a good sense of humor, which made the long negotiation and working session much more bearable. Talking was mixed with laughter as both sides cracked jokes as we went along. What a change from the days of negotiating with the FSC team.

We began the meeting at 9 am and worked late into the evening. There were many issues left to resolve, but the vast majority were technical and legal so they needed to be handled by our respective lawyers. I sat without saying much and, at 10:30 pm, as progress slowed, I suggested we adjourn. To my surprise, many on both sides of the table wanted to continue. I did not see the point of exhausting everyone needlessly now because we were not on a tight deadline, so I convinced the others to call it a night.

“It seems that the KDIC is genuinely interested in completing the process as soon as possible,” I wrote in a memo summarizing our two days of discussions. “In making an effort to do so, they try to stick to the TOI. We have more trouble with issues on which the TOI is silent. Where the TOI is not explicit, KDIC people confess that their authority is limited and they need to go back to discuss with the FSC before they can get back to us. As a result, we have tabled a number of issues until Monday next week. However, this will not delay the re-drafting process which has begun.” While there were still some major issues, and many smaller technical issues, to resolve, I was confident we'd be able to do so within the next couple of days.

We met again on Saturday, November 20, and devoted the entire day to Daewoo loans, working straight through from 9 am to about 11 pm. But it was not until Sunday, November 21, that we reached agreement on the issue, as I reported in an internal memo “Daewoo Becomes Our Best Credit.” It turned out that all the Daewoo loans were either nonperforming or restructured to forgive some principal and interest. While Newbridge had the right to put those to the government before closing, we instead agreed to keep them under specific terms.

Under the agreed-upon terms, the KDIC would treat the Daewoo loans like any other nonperforming loans that KFB would keep, and all the nonperforming loans would be protected by the KDIC for potential losses in both principal and interest after closing. I explained:

The negotiation is conducted in a friendly and business-like manner, alternately tense and relaxed and punctuated by jokes from either side (Eric Yoon's upcoming wedding and honeymoon and how it might interfere with the deal were the main targets)…. With the government guarantee, these bad loans became good loans because the ultimate credit was the government. Under these conditions, we were happy to keep them.



The arrangement for Daewoo loans would be beneficial for both sides. The hope was that, over time, some of them would work out if the borrowing entities recovered, and therefore the cost to the government would be less than if we had to put them to the government immediately. Under the same principles and conditions, the KDIC asked if we would keep all the work-out or restructured loans that we had the right to put to the government before closing. I explained in the same memo:

The KDIC wants us to keep work-out loans currently classified as non-performing loans, admitting that the FSC did not know some of the workouts were classified as non-performing loans at the time of negotiating the TOI. I said we would do so provided they were treated the same way as the remainder of Daewoo loans, i.e., the KDIC paying for our provisioning or buying on the first classification date, and [the loans] carrying a yield of government note rate plus something around 238 basis points (to cover the opportunity [cost in the form of] “lost interest margin,” as we could have re-deployed the capital to create similar amount of loans in the case of replacing these non-performing loans with government notes). The KDIC pointed out, correctly, that if it agrees to our proposal, it might have to buy back all of these if we substantially over-reserve.



The Korean government and Newbridge had agreed in the TOI to the buy/sell arrangement by which KFB would have the right to name the price of a classified or nonperforming loan and the government side would have the option to either pay the impairment value (i.e., the difference between the face value of the loan and the price named by KFB) or buy the loan at face value plus accrued interest. KFB would set aside reserves, or provisions, for the impairment value to be paid by the government. The KDIC's worry was that we might over-reserve for a loan, which meant we would claim an amount of impairment greater than what it actually was. If we did so, we would in effect force the government to buy the loan. For example, if the actual impairment was 30 cents on the dollar but we claimed it was 40 cents, the government would have no choice but to buy the loan at 100 cents because it would be better off doing so and selling it for 70 cents—losing only 30 cents— than paying the 40 cents we claimed.

This worry was ill founded, though, because there was no economic reason for KFB to over-reserve any loans. A bank would always want to keep a good interest-yielding loan and a customer; therefore, it would have no incentive to lose the loan by forcing the KDIC to buy it. It was as if we were homeowners buying fire insurance. Most people (most normal people, anyway) don't take out a policy on their homes intending to burn them down and collect the insurance money. I was confident that the KDIC would understand it the same way.

It appeared at that point that the timetable was likely to slip into December, in spite of the effort by both sides to move as fast as possible, but I was happy that our counterparts at the KDIC were as anxious to keep things moving as we were. We worked with the KDIC team for long hours every day, day after day. Although the work was intensive and exhausting, we were making good progress. The KDIC team was reasonable and cooperative, quite unlike our experiences with the FSC team, and we made every effort to accommodate them. But the pace was still slower than any of us desired.

On Wednesday, November 24, we met at KFB for a whole day, from dawn to dusk. Maybe because we had resolved all the easy issues and those remaining were the hard ones, we made no progress, despite best efforts by both sides. Ambassador Hyun suggested that we let BM Park negotiate with the KDIC team in Korean, which he thought would be more efficient, as it would be easier for both parties to understand each other. I thought it was a good idea but said we needed to reach an internal consensus on the issues and mark up the draft documents before Park could negotiate on our behalf.

Reaching consensus internally was a major effort. Because some of our team members and lawyers were based in the United States, we had to hold conference calls at night, Seoul time, to discuss the draft agreements. These calls could go on for hours. On both November 29 and 30, we began the call at about 8:30 or 9 pm and ended in the wee hours of the morning. I was still getting up and going for a run every morning, although sometimes I had to cut my running time in half. Running was the best, and often the only, time in the day for me to think uninterruptedly about various issues and to plot our strategy.

Park spent two days in negotiations with the KDIC team, but there was limited progress. We subsequently had another all-hands meeting, which resolved some issues, but many still remained. Only when Park went out for dinner with the KDIC team that night did we seem to achieve some breakthroughs.

Our team made decisions much faster than the KDIC side. I gathered that our counterparty was taking more time to make up their minds because they were concerned about making costly and irreversible mistakes. I came up with an idea to possibly allay their concerns and to enable them to make decisions more quickly. I suggested to the KDIC team that we would not mind if they retracted their decisions if they later thought they had made a mistake; meanwhile, our side would keep our word for whatever we proposed.

My thinking was based on my own personal experience buying gifts for my wife, Bin. When we lived in the United States, she often returned gifts to the store if she did not like them. But my poor taste never bothered either of us, because in the United States refunds and exchanges were commonplace. I stopped buying her gifts once we moved to Hong Kong, where general store policy seemed to be that every sale was final, with no refund or exchange. It would not bring her much happiness if I bought something she did not like and couldn't return, which happened more often than not.

I thought if we provided the KDIC team with a “full-refund” policy, so it would not have to think too hard about making a decision, our negotiation process would move faster. I explained to the KDIC team that our principle was to be fair, reasonable, and logical with what we proposed. If they accepted any terms we had proposed and later discovered our proposal did not satisfy those tests, they could withdraw their agreement. Full refund.

The full-refund policy seemed to make a difference, but maybe it was the timing. All the issues had now been thoroughly discussed between the parties. Either way, the negotiation process began to pick up pace.

Thursday, December 9, was an unusually nice winter day in Seoul, and I could see bright sunshine through the windows sitting in the conference room in the KDIC's office. We met with the KDIC team for a whole day, from 10 in the morning until about 9 in the evening, and we managed to resolve many issues related to both legal and commercial points.

By the end of the day on Friday, December 10, I thought we were close to resolving all the major issues and expected to sign the documents on December 20.

* * *

However, as old issues were resolved, new issues popped up.

On the night of December 15, JT Kim of the KDIC and I were locked in a heated debate on the methodology of calculating present value for the purpose of determining the book value of a loan. We spent two hours arguing with each other, as the rest of the teams looked on without being able to chime in. At one point, JT accused me of lecturing. JT was a graduate of the Wharton School, where I was once a professor. If I sounded like I was lecturing, it was out of habit, not intention, as I thought we were having an equal discussion. But I immediately caught myself and lowered my voice. In the end, I was able to persuade him to accept my methodology.

It was midnight when we adjourned the meeting. On our way back to the hotel, my colleague Daniel Poon, who was also a Wharton grad, told me that my methodology was wrong and JT's was right.

“Really?” I was surprised. “How?” I asked.

I saw where I had erred before Poon had finished his explanation. Poon was smart, and I trusted his judgment, especially when it came to numbers and calculations. When JT Kim and I had been arguing, even though I was listening, my mind was biased against him, which led me to hear him without really listening. When Poon explained, my mind was more receptive, and I immediately saw the logic.

“Why didn't you point it out and correct me during the meeting?” I asked him.

“Well, I didn't want to embarrass the professor,” he said.

I wasn't embarrassed, but I did feel regret. If I had given JT Kim the benefit of the doubt, we would not have wasted so much time. In the end he had probably agreed with me out of deference, or maybe exhaustion, as opposed to being really persuaded.

This, however, gave me an opportunity to implement my full-refund policy. When we went back to the meeting the next day, I apologized to JT and accepted his methodology.

I had hoped to go back to Hong Kong on Thursday, December 16. It was the last week before Christmas, and there were many holiday events planned. Newbridge's office Christmas party was scheduled for Friday the 17th, and most importantly, my daughter LeeAnn would be performing in a hand-bell recital that evening. I never wanted to miss any of the major events in our children's lives and desperately wanted to return to Hong Kong, but I could not. There were too many issues remaining, and we had to concentrate our efforts to resolve them. The negotiation ground on slowly.

On Saturday, when we were in heated discussion on what to do with a subsidiary of KFB in China, Doing-il Kim became upset. He abruptly stood up and left the room. But he soon returned, and we found a solution to the issue. That was the only flare-up in our entire negotiating process with the KDIC, but it went as quickly as it came and there were no hurt feelings on either side.

We worked so hard that there was no time to stop and go out for a meal. We had pizza delivered to us in the KDIC office for lunch and dinner three days straight.

As one part of our team was intensively working on the definitive documents with the KDIC, Dan Carroll was working with the headhunters to search for a CEO. A few months back we had identified a qualified candidate who was in Asia, waiting on the sidelines to step into the position, but as the negotiation dragged on, it remained unclear that we would ever succeed in acquiring the bank. He could not wait around for a job that might not materialize and had moved back to the United States with his family in July. Now we had to start again. Through Korn Ferry, a leading global executive search firm, we interviewed many candidates before finally selecting Wilfred Horie.

Horie was a vice president at Associates First Capital Corp. and president of its international operations. Associates was a leading U.S.-based consumer finance company that had been affiliated with Ford Motor Company. Horie had built Associates' business in Japan into the fifth-largest consumer finance business in the country. A third-generation American of Japanese descent, he had grown up in Hawaii and served in the U.S. Army Special Forces. Horie was as red-blooded an American as any I had met, and his extensive experience in consumer finance made him an excellent fit.

KFB was predominantly a corporate bank, with its business concentrated on lending to corporate customers. But that strength had led to its failure, because of the bank's exposure to a few large conglomerates. Our strategy was to transform KFB into a bank with a balanced exposure both to corporate customers and consumers, with more weight on retail banking, which was underdeveloped in South Korea.

Retail banking was the practically virgin territory. Common retail products like checking accounts, which were ubiquitous in the United States, were still almost unheard of in South Korea. People mostly transacted with cash or, rarely, with credit cards. The explosive growth of credit card use did not happen until a few years later. Retail banking also included mortgage or housing loans, which had until then largely been made by only one bank in Korea, the appropriately named Housing and Commercial Bank. In view of our strategy and the market potential, we needed someone who was familiar with retail banking.

Horie was not a traditional commercial banker by training, but his success in the consumer finance business meant he knew how to target retail customers. His expertise and experience aligned with where we wanted the bank to grow its business. We decided to appoint him as both chairman and CEO of the new KFB.

I did have some concern about Horie's Japanese ethnicity, because I was keenly aware of the deeply ambivalent and even hostile feelings many Korean people held toward Japan, which had repeatedly invaded Korea since the late 16th century and occupied it since about the end of the 19th century until 1945, when Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces. The Japanese colonial rule was known to be oppressive and brutal including enlisting or forcing Korean men and women into Japanese military service during World War II.

Many Koreans thought that Japan had never properly atoned for its brutality toward the Korean populace during colonial rule. I was a little worried about how the public might react to our appointment of a CEO with Japanese ancestry. There were, of course, many Japanese businesses operating in Korea, but KFB would be under extra scrutiny because of the bank's high profile. It was, after all, Korea First Bank. Also, taxpayers' money was involved. In the end, however, I thought the public, regulators, and KFB employees would probably care a lot more about us appointing the best CEO for the job than about his ethnic background.

The appointment of a bank's CEO required approval by banking regulators. On Wednesday, December 15, we submitted Horie's name to the FSC for its approval; we had planned to keep the name secret until the definitive agreements were signed. However, his name was leaked to the press and, by December 17, the major papers carried the story. All the headlines mentioned his Japanese ethnicity, which was obvious as his family name, Horie, was distinctly Japanese.

I received a call from Won-kyu Choi, now head of KFB's special transition task force. “Mr. Shan, are you guys going to appoint a Japanese to be CEO of Cheil Bank?” he asked in an exasperated voice.

The word cheil means “first” in Korean, and many Koreans referred to Korea First Bank as Cheil Bank. Before I was able to reply, he continued, “We are all going to quit! The entire management team will quit and many others will follow if you appoint a Japanese CEO. None of us are going to work for a Japanese.” He was almost yelling.

I was shocked. We had unexpectedly triggered a major crisis.

“But he isn't Japanese. He is American!” I protested. “He was born and raised in America, and his family was all American for generations. He served as a member of the Special Forces of the U.S. Army. That is how American he is!”

Choi reluctantly accepted my explanation and acknowledged that his military service might have mitigated his “birth defects,” but he warned me before hanging up, “You will have a problem. You will have a lot of explaining to do. You may have a lot of trouble convincing other people. I will have to think about this.”

Choi's reaction made me realize that there would be much more trouble than I had anticipated. Thanks to the leak, we had lost the chance to present Horie to the public in the best light and were now in the awkward position of playing defense. We had been fighting xenophobic sentiment toward the acquisition of KFB by a “foreign investor” for over a year now. Appointing Horie was going to be perceived as adding insult to injury. The perception was unfair, but we could not fight it.

I quickly thought of a solution in Bob Barnum. At 53 years of age, Bob was a veteran banker and had served as CFO, COO, and president of American Savings Bank. Tall and distinguished looking, he was a straight talker who did not mince words. He had been an advisor to Newbridge throughout the deal process. We were all impressed with him and his banking knowledge and experience. All of our models and strategies benefited from his extensive input. We would have considered Barnum for the chairman and CEO position, but he was unwilling to relocate to Korea from his home in California. He was willing to serve as a board member, however. If we made Barnum chairman and Horie CEO, I thought, we could present two Americans at the top of the bank, shifting the focus away from Horie's ethnicity.

All the Newbridge team members agreed that we should invite Barnum to be KFB chairman. I called Bob to ask him. He did not say no, but neither did he say yes. He said he had to think about it. I knew it would take Bonderman to persuade him. I felt confident that, given their relationship, which dated back to American Savings Bank, Bonderman would be able to convince him—after all, Bonderman had invited Barnum to advise us on the transaction in the first place.

The next day Barnum called me. As soon as I picked up the phone, he said: “No fair bringing out the big guns!”

I knew Bonderman must have gotten through to him. I laughed and said, “We can't live without you.”

All of us were keenly aware that Christmas was coming. I knew from the year before that Christmas was a big deal in Korea. It was a big deal in Hong Kong as well, and I was missing the festivities back home for the second year in a row. I did not want to spend another Christmas in Seoul. Our lawyers, advisors, and team members all wanted to go back to their families for Christmas. However, if we could not complete the transaction before the holidays, there would be no telling when we would be able to do it, if ever. Therefore, we were all strongly motivated to complete the work before Christmas. We had worked through many weekends. Now we had to work practically around the clock.

December 19 was a Sunday. The lawyers from both sides jointly produced a list of unresolved issues. During the day, both teams had internal meetings to understand the differences and to form our own positions.

After dinner, at around 8 pm, we resumed our all-hands meeting on the third floor of the Shilla Hotel. There was a strong desire by both sides to iron out our differences on all the remaining issues once and for all. As the clock ticked, I felt that it was not so much a test of endurance but a contest of patience. We almost forgot the time as we focused on our discussions. The KDIC team could win on patience, as it was still taking them much longer to make a decision, while the Newbridge team waited restlessly. But we were tied on endurance, as neither side asked to adjourn the meeting or even take a break. It was not until eight the next morning when we finally finished. We had spent 12 hours in that conference room in a single nonstop meeting, working overnight.

Even though we did not resolve all the issues, the all-nighter was productive. I slept for only three hours and was up again at 11 am on Monday, December 20. There were 10 remaining issues to settle, but I was relaxed. I felt that it would not be so difficult for us to find common ground on them. We met again at 9 pm and, within an hour, we had reached agreement on nine of the 10 issues. The last one was not significant enough for us to bother with at this stage, and I was confident we could compromise on it later.

We largely concluded our negotiations on the definitive documents on the night of December 20. Even though we knew new issues might pop up as the lawyers committed what we had agreed upon to paper, neither side expected any major ones. Now the lawyers had to work to revise the documents while reconciling their differences. They had already been revising the documents in real time as we negotiated. Throughout our discussions the lawyers on both sides were busy writing, without so much as raising their heads. But their work was more than just transcription; they also had to discuss and agree on the specific language on every page in these drafting sessions. That was a massive amount of work, and progress was painfully slow.

All of us from both sides were now camped out in the Shilla Hotel. Even the Koreans who lived in Seoul did not go home. We spent 24 hours a day in that hotel, to the delight, I was sure, of its management. We must have made their sales budget for the entire month that week. Not only did we stay there, we took over the entire business center for our meetings and drafting sessions. We also ate every meal there, ordering room service brought to the conference room.

It felt surreal to me that at any time, around the clock, any kind of food could be ordered just by picking up the phone. The Shilla had at least five restaurants and all sorts of Western and Asian cuisine. I remembered my days working as a hard laborer in China's Gobi Desert as a youth, starving and not knowing when the next meal would be. It was unthinkable to me that food could be so readily available at any time for so many people. I marveled aloud about it again and again. Finally, Paul Chen said to me, to the laughter of all: “Shan, stop. Only you feel this way. The rest of us don't give a damn. You aren't a peasant anymore. Just eat and gain some weight.”

So much food, so taken for granted; I could not get over it.

Capital raising was one stream of work I had not anticipated. By 1999, we were investing Newbridge Capital's second fund, which had about $450 million to invest. Typically, a private equity fund would not put more than 20 percent of its total fund size into one transaction, to avoid what is called concentration risk. The idea is to spread the capital across multiple investments to minimize the downside if any one of them went south. Twenty percent of $450 million gave us about $90 million we could earmark for the KFB deal, which left us well short of the $500 million or so the transaction required. But Newbridge was affiliated with TPG, a much larger firm with a multi-billion-dollar fund, as well as with RCBA, Dick Blum's investment firm. I had never worried about having enough capital for the KFB deal.

For some reason, however, TPG could not invest in KFB, even though we knew many of our limited partners, as our investors were known, would be happy to invest with us. Carroll and TPG's investor relations office had begun to reach out to potential co-investors after we signed the TOI. The co-investors, of course, would have to go through their own due diligence process to evaluate the opportunity. That required much work on our side as well because we had to be ready to answer questions as they went through their own processes.

Our advisor, O'Hanlon, had relocated to Lehman's Tokyo office from New York City. He called to tell me that Masayoshi Son, chairman of SoftBank, might be interested in joining the KFB deal and would like to meet with me. By 1999, SoftBank was a high-flying company, having invested in numerous internet-related businesses, many of which had become worth billions of dollars in the stock market thanks to the dot-com bubble. Son was also interested in banks. Like me, Son was an alumnus of University of California at Berkeley. A mutual friend of ours once told me that Son had developed his long-term business plan while a student at Berkeley.

“Do you know how long his long-term plan was?” the friend asked me.

By the tone of his question, I knew it was very long. I ventured, “Twenty years?”

“No,” he replied. “Three hundred years.”

Well, Son was certainly longer term in his thinking than any other mortal I knew. It reminded me of a quote by the economist John Maynard Keynes: “In the long run, we are all dead.” There is no denying, however, that winners in business are often visionaries.

I met with Son on Monday, December 20, in the Shilla Hotel, where he was also staying. I was happy to talk with him about KFB. I spent some time reviewing the deal and our plans for the bank. After I finished, Son said he was indeed interested in going in with us on the investment.

Knowing SoftBank was a Japanese company, I asked him if he thought there would be a political or public relations problem for us if we invited him to invest in KFB. He said that, to the contrary, his investment would be perceived positively. He gave me two reasons. First, President DJ Kim had invited him to invest in Korea many times, so his entry would be welcomed. Second, he said, he had Korean blood.

Son was Japanese, but he was of Korean descent. His family had adopted a Japanese surname, Yasumoto, but he decided to use his Korean surname upon returning to Japan after finishing his studies in the United States. I imagine he was respected in Korea for his Korean origin and for his success in business. I also thought it was ironic that many Koreans would have an issue with Horie, an American of Japanese descent, but the same people probably felt just fine with Son, a Japanese of Korean descent.

Son gave me a third reason why it would be good for us if he invested. He and his company could bring strategic value to KFB in areas like internet banking. I was persuaded and said to him that we would welcome his co-investment.

Then we proceeded to talk about how much he would invest. He said he had to invest no less than 30 percent of the capital required, or about $150 million, or he would not be interested. I was a little surprised but since I thought he would be a good partner, I said we would consider it. Then I explained that all the investors or limited partners would pay Newbridge, the general partner, a management fee and a share of any future profit, called carried interest, for managing the investment. That is how private equity firms make money. We only get paid our carried interest if we make money for investors.

Surprised, he looked at me and said, “People usually pay me for investing in their companies.”

This was probably true. SoftBank was hot then. It seemed that whatever Son touched became an overnight success in the stock market, purely on the strength of SoftBank's endorsement. But we were not an internet company, nor did we have a publicly traded stock. We made money the old-fashioned way, by focusing on improving the cash flow and profitability of the companies we invested in.

I did not flinch. I looked at him and said, “I have to make a living.”

He laughed. “You are good. You are good,” he repeated and then said, “You will be very, very rich.”

He then said the reason people paid him to invest with them was because the returns on his investments in the past couple of years had been between 500 and 1,000 percent. I knew he was right. This was the year before the dot-com bubble burst, and internet companies were scaling new heights in the stock market every day. Nonetheless, Son said he would consider making an exception.

I told him that I appreciated it and that he should also know I would be making an exception to charge him a reduced carry. He laughed again and repeated, “You are good.”

We spent about two hours together. Before I left, he said he would need a night to think about the carry issue, and we agreed to meet again the next morning at eleven-thirty. The next day, Tuesday, December 21, I was working so intensively on the transaction documents that I completely forgot my appointment with Son until about noon. I am usually punctual and I felt a sense of panic when I realized that I was so late. Fortunately, Son was staying in the same hotel. I rushed upstairs to meet with him. I was relieved that he did not seem to notice my tardiness, probably because he was busy doing other things. We spent about half an hour together, negotiating how much of a discount in the carry we would give him, and we soon reached agreement. Quite unexpectedly, SoftBank became our largest limited partner in our KFB investment.

The lawyers worked on the documents nonstop through the night of December 20. They continued to work during the day and into the night of December 21. There were hundreds of pages to write, revise, reconcile, and finalize. There was little I could do to help with the drafting, but all of us were hanging around the conference rooms in the hotel's business center. Whenever issues came up and the lawyers could not resolve them by themselves, the two Kims of the KDIC and our team, sometimes with our respective lawyers, would sit down to resolve them. I met with Eric Yoon of White & Case, who had returned from his three-week honeymoon, and we were able to resolve the last of the 10 issues from the previous day. Whereas before the TOI, I had thought of Yoon as the bane of our existence, ever since the TOI was signed, he had been a delight to work with, now that our objectives were aligned.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep on the night of December 21. I went to the business center early the next morning to discover that, for the second night in a row, the lawyers had worked straight through. They looked exhausted, bent low over their computers, typing, with big stacks of paper by their sides, comparing and discussing drafts with each other. There was no time for a break because we needed to finish before tomorrow, our target day for the signing. But as the day turned dark, I was really worried how long they could continue; they had been at it for three days straight. What they were doing seemed humanly impossible.

As I watched them working away that night, I thought that the lawyers were heroes. They were literally killing themselves to get the work completed to meet our deadline. They were working so carefully and so meticulously, checking every paragraph, every sentence, every phrase, and every word, even though they were horribly sleep-deprived.

Years later, I ran into Rich Lincer, one of our key lawyers from Clearly Gottlieb, at a book party for my last book. We hadn't seen each other in more than 10 years. Rich had lost his full head of hair, although he looked not much older than when I had last seen him. He told me that he had lost his hair after many nights without sleep while working extremely hard on the Obama administration's bailout of General Motors in 2008–2009. His dedication really took a toll on him.

By dinnertime on December 22, lawyers on both sides, led by Lincer on our side and Yoon on their side, called a meeting with Dong-il Kim of the KDIC and me. They needed sleep, the lawyers told us. It would be impossible to get everything done by tomorrow morning. Lincer said that it was absurd to stick to the arbitrary December 23 timetable, as it was impossible to finish the job. The suggestion was to break for Christmas and resume the work afterward.

I felt torn. There was absolutely no question in my mind that the lawyers had reached their physical and mental limits, and actually were way beyond them, but I was also worried. I did not want to spend another Christmas in Seoul, as I had last year. But my main concern was that if we were to break now, we would likely not resume until after New Year's. That would mean lost momentum, and even a risk that if we stopped or slowed down, the deal might fall apart again. That was a risk we could not afford to take.

Of the three documents, the assistance agreement, arguably the most important as it involved the terms of assistance to be provided by the government to KFB, was still a long way from completion. How about if we sign the documents already completed? I suggested. We could leave the rest until after the holidays. That way, we would lock up the deal because at least one or two of the definitive agreements would be signed.

Lincer did not think it was a good idea. He warned me that we would be taking grave risks by signing some, but not all, of the documents. Poon agreed with him. I was not so sure. My prime motivation was to lock the other side into this deal so there could be no unraveling under any circumstances. I was willing to sign just one of the three agreements. I thought it was at least the second-best option if it was impossible to get all the documents done by the next day.

Coincidentally, I was scheduled to meet Horie for the first time for dinner that night. In anticipation of the signing of definitive agreements the next day, Horie had arrived in Seoul, and I was to introduce him to reporters at the signing ceremony. I had to prepare him for the event, but as soon as Paul Chen and I sat down with him in the hotel's Japanese restaurant, I received an urgent call from our colleague, Steve Lim. I was needed at the business center for a meeting with Dong-il Kim and the lawyers.

Dong-il Kim appeared to be more distressed than I was about the potential signing delay. He was deeply worried that tomorrow's scheduled signing would have to be canceled. Furthermore, he was disturbed by a draft press release prepared by a Mr. Lee at Edelman, our PR firm, which denied that there would be a signing of the final agreements and an announcement tomorrow.

The FSC and MOFE had already leaked the joint press release I had prepared earlier, Dong-il told me, and had already approved the documents that we would sign tomorrow. From the government side, the signing had to happen as scheduled. It would be a huge loss of face and credibility if it did not. The draft press release denying that the signing would take place greatly disturbed him, as he thought that it was my official position.

I read through the draft release quickly, then slammed it down on the table and said firmly, to calm his nerves, “I didn't know anything about this denial. It wasn't my idea and we aren't going to use it.”

That may have calmed Dong-il Kim, but I also knew we were at the end of our rope. None of us knew how to get the rest of the paperwork done in time for signing tomorrow. There was just no way. The lawyers would go on strike if we pushed them any further. I suggested that we break the meeting and separately think about a solution.

Lincer felt strongly that there was no way to get all the documentation done in time. The problem was that the KDIC's legal team was understaffed. While we had four lawyers from Cleary and three from Kim & Chang—seven in all—they had only three, Lee from Lee & Ko and Yoon and Philip Gilligan from White & Case. Every word in the documents had to be agreed upon by lawyers on both sides. Our team could take turns sleeping, but the KDIC's lawyers could not sleep at all. As of dinnertime, they had not even begun to work on the assistance agreement. Making matters worse, Yoon had been on his honeymoon since November 23 and was just getting up to speed. As the government's key lawyer, he did not know enough about the discussions of the past several weeks.

I took BM Park of Kim & Chang out for a walk around the hotel lobby. I wanted to know if he had any advice for me. He shared my fear that if the deal was not done by tomorrow, there remained a risk that it would fall apart. Lincer and Poon thought that if we signed only part of the agreement, there would be a risk the government could blame us if the deal eventually collapsed. Now my fear was that the government would blame us for the deal's failure if we did not get it done by tomorrow. That was why Dong-il Kim was so upset by the draft press release.

Chatting with Park, a bold and extremely unconventional idea hit me. The bottleneck was the KDIC legal team, which was not only understaffed but also underinformed about what had been agreed to regarding the assistance agreement. What if we seconded one of our lawyers to work for the KDIC side? Park, standing in front of me, was the ideal candidate. Under normal circumstances, this idea would be considered ludicrous. After all, we were on the opposite side of the negotiating table with the KDIC. The KDIC might think we were proposing to send a fox to guard their henhouse. The idea was risky from our point of view as well. What if Park compromised our interests and suddenly switched sides? In any case, the young lawyer did not seem shocked by my idea. After thinking it over, he said he would be willing to do it if both parties agreed to it.

I thought Dong-il Kim might also be receptive to the idea—not because he was desperate but because he trusted Park to be fair, impartial, and professional. After all, Park only needed to make sure that the final agreement accurately reflected what the parties had already agreed to, and his work would have to stand up to scrutiny even after we had signed the final agreements. Park was unique because we trusted him and his integrity, and I thought the KDIC team did as well. I was gambling, just as Chairman Lee of the FSC had, that the KDIC team would trust the Kim & Chang lawyers to do what was best for Korea.

I brought together Lincer, Chen, and Poon to share my idea with them. Lincer thought I was nuts but he did not have a better suggestion. Chen and Poon also thought the idea was crazy but agreed it was probably the only way to solve our common problem. But this was too unusual an idea and too big a decision to be made in haste.

I took Park to the hotel's Japanese restaurant, where Horie had finished dinner but was still waiting for me to return. I briefed Horie on the difficult situation we were in and apologized again for not being able to have dinner with him. Nor could I spare any time with him at that hour, as I had to think about how to handle the current conundrum. Horie left for his room.

I was so tense that I took a cigarette from Marc Rubinstein of Kim & Chang. I don't smoke, but I wanted to be soothed by the smell of raw tobacco, which always reminded me of my father, who was a chain smoker. I asked Park not to talk for five minutes because I needed complete silence to mull over my idea. Park went out for a smoke himself, but he never returned. I was now alone in the restaurant.

I ordered a steak but, before the waiter went to the kitchen, I called him back and told him to bring me two steaks. He looked at me as if I were out of my mind. When the food came, I quickly ate two generous servings of beef, even though I usually stayed away from red meat. I was worried and desperate, and the food distracted me somewhat.

I made up my mind as I was eating. I went back to the business center to talk with Dong-il Kim and offered him the use of Park for the assistance agreement. I explained to him the history of the TOI negotiations and suggested Park as the only solution to the problem we had. Dong-il looked at me in disbelief, then he walked away thinking. He did not specifically agree but he did not object either. Soon, Park quietly began to work on the other side of the table.

At about 1 am, I received an unexpected visitor: a Mr. Kang of the Korea Development Bank. He wanted to talk with me about selling a forward contract to Newbridge to exchange dollars into Korean won, as we would eventually need to do so in order to close the transaction. He came to see me at this odd hour probably because he had read about the signing of final agreements on December 23 and did not want to be late for a possible deal. He offered me a forward rate of 1,122 won to a dollar, which I thought so ridiculously unfavorable to us that I turned him down. But I had to admire his aggressiveness to pitch a sale at 1 am, without being invited, especially considering the fact he was working for a government-owned bank.

I went back to my hotel room at about 2 am on December 23 to catch some sleep, not sure at all what would transpire in the next few hours.

I woke up at about 5 am wondering about another rather urgent matter on my mind. I had earlier signed a noncompete letter with Masayoshi Son, but I was wondering now if the letter would give us sufficient protection against his getting into competition with us in the future. I called Dan Carroll in San Francisco and we decided to wake up the SoftBank point man on the KFB investment. Carroll was able to persuade him to agree to revise the letter to include some more restrictive language. But I could not stay for the end of the negotiations, because in the middle of those talks Poon called to say Dong-il Kim and his team needed to speak with me about some issues that had come up in my absence.

When I went down to the conference room in the business center, I was pleasantly surprised to find the lawyers had made good progress in the past few hours, and now everyone thought the documents would be ready by 9 am. Seconding Park to the other side turned out to have made a huge difference. I was still skeptical that we could finish by 9 am, but I was tremendously relieved to know the documents would be ready to be signed sometime that day. This renewed hope of finishing on time undoubtedly motivated everyone to work even harder. By then, several lawyers had not slept for three nights straight, but everyone continued to forge on. Their tenacity and fortitude was quite unbelievable.

The government had scheduled a press conference for the signing and announcement to take place at nine that morning at KFB's head office. Dong-il Kim wanted to postpone the press conference. I advised him not to do so at this point, because it looked like we might finish at any moment. The lawyers were getting close, and we were all anxiously waiting and helping them where we could. This event had been so long anticipated by the press that I thought reporters would not mind being kept in suspense a little longer.

At about 9 am, we had a final meeting to discuss a few remaining issues. Dong-il Kim and I agreed without difficulty on the questions that had come up overnight. One major item had to do with the warrants for 5 percent of KFB's equity, which we had offered to give to the government a year ago, at the time of the MOU. At the last minute, we discovered that Korean law did not allow naked warrants, or warrants not attached to any securities. I proposed to change the term “warrants” to “options,” which were basically the same thing. But the KDIC side did not think that would work either. Eventually, we agreed to their proposal for KFB to issue a zero-coupon (bearing no interest) bond with warrants to KDIC. That was the final issue to be resolved.

I had bought a disposable camera from the hotel's gift shop and took pictures of people from both teams working together, disheveled and seemingly distraught, in the final hours of completing the definitive documents. I thought the moment was worth recording. (See Exhibits 7 through 9.)

It was nearly 10:45 am when we finished all the documents. The three agreements were marked up, and both parties agreed to their content. They were ready to be sealed, even though we did not have time to produce a clean version, free of markups. Now we knew we could go home in time for Christmas Eve and would be able to enjoy the holiday free of any worry about this deal. We were all so tired but so relieved.

I went back to my room, took a shower, and changed. Then we left for the news conference at KFB headquarters. I rode in the same car as Horie. I called Bonderman on my way, but he was not home. Nor was Blum. I reached Carroll to tell him that we got it done and were on our way to the signing. The moment that all of us had been working so hard for had finally arrived. The union of Newbridge and KFB was complete (Exhibit 10).

I looked at the time. It was 11 am, Thursday, December 23, 1999, the day before Christmas Eve. It had been a long 15 months since Carroll and I had seen that first teaser from Morgan Stanley about buying a Korean bank.
