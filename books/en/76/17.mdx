title: 17 It's a Race
---






On November 10, 2004, I received an unexpected phone call from Rodney Ward. The tall, silver-haired Englishman was the Asia Pacific chairman of UBS, the Swiss banking giant. We had known each other for years, and I considered him a friend.

Ward quickly came to the point. He was calling on behalf of Standard Chartered Bank to express interest in acquiring KFB.

StanChart, as Standard Chartered was sometimes known, had made an overture to us months earlier but had not been able to move forward. Its renewed interest was timely, as HSBC's exclusivity period had just expired five days ago and we were at liberty to speak with other suitors. I was hoping StanChart would step forward because we needed to keep our options open in case HSBC's offer did not come through.

I was a little surprised that the call had come from Ward, though. I knew both Peter Sands, StanChart's CFO, and David Stileman, its chief of strategy and business development. They could have easily reached out directly. Yet it was not unusual for a prospective buyer to use an intermediary to facilitate serious discussions. The more I thought about it, the more I considered it to be a good sign. StanChart must have been serious if it had engaged UBS to advise it on a potential deal.

But I was soon disappointed. When I asked Ward how serious StanChart's interest was, he said, “I think it is highly unlikely that StanChart will come through with a confirmation of interest and an offer.”

This was quite odd. It was like saying “We are interested, but our interest is unlikely to be real.” Why would anyone deliver such a mixed message? What was the point? Then I realized that UBS was probably StanChart's long-term and regular advisor in matters like this. As such, UBS would be obliged to make a phone call when asked to by someone senior at StanChart, but in Ward's honest opinion, his client was unlikely to be a serious buyer. He probably wanted to be up front with me as a friend, lest he got my hopes up for nothing.

The subtext of our conversation, though, was that StanChart did have an interest in buying KFB and had tasked UBS to look into it, but Ward thought StanChart wouldn't be able to pull off such a big acquisition. Whether he thought StanChart could not afford it or its board would not give its approval, he did not say.

Nonetheless, we were willing to work with StanChart to see how its interest might develop.

We had moved boxes of files and KFB data to Hong Kong for HSBC's due diligence needs. We agreed to share the material with StanChart, after signing a confidentiality agreement, to enable it to develop a proposal. I reported to my partners in a memo on November 16, 2004, about this new potential buyer:

Re: Project Daisy

Meanwhile, the advisor to another potential buyer (code-named Project Daisy) has indicated that it will provide us with a proposal by the end of this week. They know the price guideline is Citi/KorAm benchmark and their proposal will have had the benefit of no less data than what Lion has received to date.



David Stileman, StanChart's chief of strategy and business development, was a tall and impeccably mannered British gentleman. I found his upper-crust accent pleasing, as it reminded me of the Linguaphone language courses on cassette, which I'd used when I first began to study English in college. Stileman also had a good sense of humor, which I appreciated. He reported to Peter Sands, the bank's CFO, who would take over as CEO in 2006. Where Sands was uptight and circumspect, Stileman was relaxed and direct.

StanChart's headquarters in Hong Kong is a narrow, sand-colored tower that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with HSBC's broader edifice, facing Hong Kong's Des Voeux Road. Completed a few years after the HSBC building, StanChart's was more modest in appearance—a sloop to HSBC's battleship. It did, however, have a long flight of stone stairs one had to climb to reach its heavy front door, giving it the feel of an old, distinguished bank.

On Monday, November 22, my colleague Daniel Poon and I met with Sands, Stileman, and Nancy Wong, Stileman's deputy, in a small conference room in the corner of the building, with windows looking out onto a busy street. The StanChart executives were prepared to give us a proposal.

We all knew what we were here for, but Sands did not immediately come to the point. Instead, he danced around with small questions about this and that for more than half an hour. He finally gave us the proposal after I said that we were not interested in continuing to discuss a deal in abstract terms.

When I told them that KFB would announce later that afternoon that Newbridge was in preliminary discussions with potential buyers, Sands promptly asked for the proposal back. Daniel Poon had already left with StanChart's proposal and was heading back to the office. Sands must have thought the announcement indicated we were close to a deal with HSBC and was disturbed that we might be using StanChart as a stalking horse. I explained to him that KFB had no choice but to make an announcement because the sale had been leaked to the press and we would not be able to keep it a secret anyhow because due diligence work by prospective buyers at KFB headquarters would involve many KFB employees. I tried to reassure him that we always dealt with people in good faith. But I could tell he remained deeply skeptical.

Meanwhile, I had to intercept Poon en route to the office to hand the proposal back to Sands.

Thursday, November 25 was Thanksgiving Day. Even though it was not officially observed in Hong Kong, my family never missed a turkey meal together. In the middle of dinner, I received a phone call from Ward at UBS. Without being prompted, he spoke somewhat apologetically about the “eccentric behavior” of StanChart, his client for taking back its proposal. Nonetheless, he reiterated his view that it would be difficult for StanChart to buy KFB.

Shortly after I got off the phone with Ward, Stileman called. There had been a debate among StanChart executive directors, he told me, about pursuing the KFB deal. Some of them continued to worry that we might be using them as a stalking horse against HSBC, he said, but earlier that day one of their advisors had received a phone call from a senior executive at HSBC who said that StanChart would be “ill-advised” to go after Korea First Bank. That warning shot had apparently backfired. Stileman was calling to tell me that Standard Chartered wanted to move forward.

How ironic, I thought. There was no better way for someone to shoot himself in the foot than by ordering his rival to stand down. It produced exactly the opposite effect by galvanizing the competitor to rise up to the challenge.

However, Stileman and his CEO, Mervyn Davies, needed to meet with their own chairman to get him to “check the box.” Stileman said he would get back to me overnight as to whether or not they had received the chairman's go-ahead.

I appreciated Stileman's candor. To further encourage StanChart, I told him that we would prepare the data room for their immediate use and that we could give them a draft sales and purchase agreement by the following Monday. StanChart had to tell us how fast it could move, and we would do everything we could to accommodate their dates. I was quite happy about this communication and hoped that StanChart would indeed come through. A real competitive process would make the KFB sale much more foolproof.

I was enjoying a second turkey dinner at a Thanksgiving party the next evening when Stileman called back at about 9 pm. He told me the good news that StanChart's chairman had given the potential deal his blessing and that the StanChart team would begin due diligence on KFB on Monday. In fact, the StanChart team had already geared up; Poon had heard from them earlier in the day. Stileman made no mention of StanChart's earlier proposal or any further details. I was encouraged nonetheless and hoped once StanChart was drawn into the process, its people would build a strong conviction about our bank. At a minimum, we would have a viable alternative to HSBC. And in an ideal situation, the two-horse race would allow us to get a better price.

Hong Kong was unusually warm in the winter of 2004. It was already December 12, but the temperature was a tropical 87 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius).

StanChart proposed a conversation between its CEO, Mervyn Davies, and Newbridge’s co-chairman, David Bonderman. I wrote a memo that evening to prep Bonderman for the meeting. In it, I advised that we manage StanChart and HSBC differently. StanChart was unsure of itself, afraid it might be used as a stalking horse and therefore reluctant to step forward, whereas HSBC was the opposite. It was so confident, in fact, that it did not consider the possibility of any viable competition. Therefore, our strategy should be to encourage StanChart and to draw it deep into the process.

One telling sign of HSBC's confidence and StanChart's reluctance was the number of people each sent to conduct due diligence in Seoul on the first day we opened data rooms for them. “HSBC showed up with an army, probably 20 people from different departments and even more people from their advisors, all headed by the head of its audit department,” reported Poon. In contrast, “StanChart showed up with only three people.”

Our other co-chairman, Dick Blum, called me on the morning of Saturday, December 18, to tell me that he had had a conversation with John Bond. Blum and Bond knew each other well, and I was somewhat wary of that. We had a competitive process going and I did not want it to be preempted. That would not be fair to StanChart, to which I already had given assurances, as had Bonderman, that we would treat them equally with other bidders. Blum told me that Bond had reiterated the offer HSBC had indicated from the start: HSBC would buy KFB for $3 billion.

Later that day, I went to the China Club to have lunch with Chandra. The club was located on the top three floors of the Old Bank of China, a dignified 1950s-era, 17-story stone building that now looked somewhat quaint nestled between the HSBC building and the new Bank of China tower across the street. The club was founded by TT Tsui, a well-known socialite and antique collector in Hong Kong. Styled after a Shanghai tea house circa 1930, its walls are covered with contemporary and classical works of Chinese art. Curated by Johnson Chang of Hanart TZ Gallery, the eye-popping collection features the work of artists who have become staples of the contemporary art scene. Many of the works were humorous, satirical, or mocking in nature. For example, there was a dark oil painting, in the style of a classical group portrait, of some Manchurian officials in traditional imperial costumes. But if you looked closely, among the mandarins were Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, in a tall hat, tailcoat, and bow tie, and Tsui himself dressed as a Qing dynasty official.

Chandra arrived late. He apologized and told me that on Bond's orders he had worked the whole night to give us an offer letter by lunchtime. I had no idea what had prompted Bond to do so, other than that the conversation he had with Blum must have given him the idea HSBC could preempt the auction process. The letter confirmed the purchase price of $3 billion for KFB. Chandra told me they wanted us to take or leave the offer by noon on Monday, which I considered unreasonable. Nevertheless, we had a pleasant lunch. Chandra repeated how impressed HSBC was by KFB under our management.

That afternoon, I talked with Stileman by phone. He was in England and was about to go out to shoot pheasants, which the English considered a sport. Earlier, he had given us a valuation range for KFB, and now he said that Standard Chartered would bid at or above the high end. I thought he was testing me, but I did not have a chance to tell him that his number was not good enough before he signed off.

At about 11:30 pm, I reached Bonderman, who was on his plane, en route to his home in Aspen, Colorado. I told him of my conversations with both HSBC and StanChart. Now that HSBC had made a bid, we needed a bid from StanChart as soon as possible. I asked Bonderman to call Bryan Sanderson, Standard Chartered's chairman, to prompt him to give us a bid.

Early the next morning, I went for my usual early morning run on Bowen Road. Tree-lined and cool, the street was blocked to traffic for most of its length, making it a popular place for people to exercise.

As I ran, I thought over our negotiations with both HSBC and StanChart. I had yet to hear back from Bonderman about his conversation with Sanderson. After I finished my run, I called Bonderman. He told me that Sanderson had suggested that StanChart would bid at the top end of its indicated range, which was 3.1 trillion won, or just shy of $3 billion, but the price was in Korean won, which was appreciating in value.

It was a Sunday and I was mindful of Chandra's request for us to get back to HSBC no later than noon on Monday. The indication from StanChart, coming from its highest level, provided me with enough confidence not to accept HSBC's offer, and I thought I didn't have to wait until Monday to let them know. I called Chandra and informed him that HSBC's offer was not good enough. He did not seem surprised. HSBC knew someone else was looking, which was probably the reason HSBC wanted to preempt the process. I think he was only surprised that the competition had been able to move fast enough to make a bid. It had taken HSBC more than two months to get to that point.

At 5 pm, Stileman called and told me that StanChart would offer no less than 3.25 trillion won, up from 3.1 trillion. I thought about Bonderman's call with Sanderson and realized the StanChart chairman must have sensed that 3.1 trillion won was not good enough, as Bonderman must have seemed far from overjoyed to hear it. The new offer of 3.25 trillion won would translate into $3.08 billion at the exchange rate of the day, so StanChart's offer was already about $80 million better than HSBC's. This was a relief. I now knew a two-horse race had begun.

Stileman emphasized that StanChart would give us a real offer after Bonderman spoke again with Sanderson and with the CEO, Mervyn Davies, later that day. I did not understand why they would stretch it out like this, with Stileman calling me to give an indication and senior leadership calling Bonderman to give us a “real offer.” But I supposed they wanted us to take their offer seriously by making it in a formal way, chairman to chairman.

I immediately wrote Bonderman to inform him of what had transpired on both HSBC's and StanChart's sides and to prepare him for his call with the StanChart people.

The next morning, Monday, December 20, I learned that Bonderman had spoken with Mervyn Davies. Even better than what Stileman had told me, StanChart's CEO communicated their bid to Bonderman at 3.3 trillion won, which was about $128 million better than HSBC's at that day's exchange rate. Davies also told Bonderman that StanChart's written offer would come in by 5 pm London time that day.

I was scheduled to meet with Chandra at 11 am. But that morning, I received an email from him, saying that HSBC had kept its word with its offer and that they expected us to sign the offer letter by noon today or it would expire. I also received an email from Smith saying the same thing. These messages implied we had given them our word, which they now expected us to keep, when in truth we had never given them our word nor accepted their offered price. Having willingly entered into what they referred to as a “mini-auction” process, they wanted to preempt that process by pushing us to accept their offer. Apart from that, their offer was not even binding without a fully negotiated sales and purchase agreement. There were still many contractual and legal issues outstanding. HSBC simply wanted to pressure us into accepting its offer by threatening to go away otherwise.

I was more amused than threatened, however. I had already informed Chandra that we would not be able to make a decision by the proposed deadline of noon today. We certainly did not want to lose HSBC as a bidder, but I knew a bluff when I saw it. HSBC was already too invested in this process, and their pressure on us, I felt, simply betrayed the team’s anxiety.

I also knew that even if HSBC walked, there was a better offer on the table from Standard Chartered. Even though it was also lacking in detail, I was not too worried. I imagined it was quite solid, as it was communicated directly to Bonderman by StanChart's CEO. So, I let HSBC's deadline pass while discussing with Chandra, face-to-face, a number of issues in the offer letter in his office. I also informed Chandra we had a better offer.

I then told Chandra that we needed an offer in Korean won, not in U.S. dollars. There were two reasons. The Korean won was appreciating, which meant the value of KFB was appreciating in U.S. dollar terms. If we had fixed the price in U.S. dollars, we would not be able to capture the appreciation in value from a stronger won. More importantly, our partner and fellow shareholder in KFB was the Korean government, and it would need to be paid in won.

I had thought that as a global bank, HSBC would have no problem offering the price in Korean won, as it could easily hedge its own currency risks. But for some reasons, HSBC simply would not agree to offer a price in Korean currency. My only explanation for this was that it wanted to profit from the weakening of the dollar against the won, even though it could have achieved the same effect by buying forward won contracts, which would allow it to essentially lock in any future currency appreciation. I tried to impress upon Chandra how imperative it was to receive a price in won. But it seemed impossible for HSBC to accept. We finished the meeting at 12:30 pm, 30 minutes after HSBC's self-imposed deadline.

StanChart had engaged Allen & Overy, a London law firm with a large practice in Hong Kong, for the proposed transaction. Its offices were in Two IFC as well. That afternoon, I went to Allen & Overy to meet with a representative of StanChart and a few lawyers. Poon and another colleague, Scott Chen, joined me for the meeting as well. There were only a few key issues arising from our draft sales and purchase agreement. I led the discussion on our side. We had to adjourn several times for our side to caucus among ourselves.

We were mindful of the fact that the stickiest issue with HSBC was its insistence on withholding taxes on our behalf. We were relieved that StanChart did not raise the issue at all, as it was indeed not market practice for the buyer to withhold taxes on behalf of the seller. But our Korean counsel, Kim & Chang, insisted that we raise the issue ourselves and get StanChart to explicitly agree not to withhold taxes on our behalf. I was not enthusiastic about this plan. If it was not an issue for them, why did we have to bring it up? If we brought it up, would we practically invite them to insist on being able to withhold taxes?

The Kim & Chang lawyers thought there was a risk for us if we did not to spell out the withholding issue because of a legal concept called “unjust enrichment.” In this case, the buyer might be able to come back to us for recovery if there was ever a withholding tax imposed on the buyer, unless the buyer had specifically agreed to accept the risk. I always thought lawyers would imagine the most remote possibilities in preparing a legal document, which was the reason why these documents were so long.

Poon and Yong Lee, one of our lawyers from Cleary Gottlieb, suggested that we include some specific “tax gross up” language, which basically would require the buyer to accept the risk of potential liability. I thought suggesting such language would be risky because it could raise a new issue that the other side might not agree with. Eventually, I suggested that we revise the “no-claim” language, which basically said that the buyer would have absolutely no claim against the seller after closing, excluding fraud and willful misconduct. Both our lawyers and theirs agreed to the proposed language, which would eliminate the risk of StanChart ever coming back to us for not having withheld taxes on our behalf.

Another issue that HSBC had sensitized us to was management compensation. HSBC wanted the seller to pay for the severance of any management personnel it decided not to keep. We wanted to make sure StanChart would accept that any severance pay would be the responsibility of the bank after the sale. StanChart lawyers initially were concerned whether there might be “illegality” under Korean regulations on management compensation if the bank accepted that responsibility. Eventually, we agreed that StanChart would have the right to restructure the compensation after closing, to minimize any risk of sensitivities caused by the possibility of large severance packages for senior management people. That resolved a major concern of ours, and by the close of the meeting we reached agreement on all the key issues.

Bonderman called me at about 7:20 pm. I gave him an update and told him that I was still waiting to receive the promised offer letter from Stileman. As I was on the conference call, Blum called a couple of times. He was worried about StanChart's offer. He wanted to talk with Bond of HSBC and cut a deal with him quickly because of their relationship. I was concerned about this plan, because that would be unfair to StanChart and to us. Blum asked me if I would agree to his asking Bond to accept a deal for $3.1 billion and giving him two hours to decide. I did not like the idea because we would not give StanChart an opportunity to counter, and StanChart might not even send us the promised written offer. I was mindful of having given my word to StanChart to provide it with a fair chance.

However, while StanChart's offer was better, we all knew there was more uncertainty with it. Standard Chartered did not have enough cash on hand to consummate the transaction and would need to raise capital. HSBC had more than enough cash on its balance sheet to close the deal. At the current exchange rate, StanChart's offer was worth about $3.128 billion. Reasoning that $3.1 billion with certainty was better than $3.128 billion without it, I advised Blum that if he could get Bond to make that offer, we should take it.

I woke up on the morning of December 21, 2004, to a big surprise. Dan Carroll called me to say that Blum had cut a deal with Bond overnight to sell the bank to HSBC for $3.05 billion. This obviously was not as good as I would have liked, but I could understand Blum's desire to help Bond and his institution. StanChart's offer letter came through the previous night as well. Unfortunately, the fax machine in my office had run out of paper, so we did not see the offer until StanChart followed up with an email. The email confirmed the offer price of 3.3 trillion won, but there were a number of conditions attached.

The main condition, of course, was that StanChart's offer was subject to its being able to raise the needed capital. Another condition was that if its stock price fell below 900 pence per share on the London stock exchange, it would have the right to walk away. StanChart also wanted a right to back out of the transaction by paying a $50 million penalty, or breakup fee. Furthermore, the offer was subject to approval by StanChart's shareholders both in Hong Kong, where StanChart was also listed, and in London. I did not think any of the conditions were acceptable. Even though the offer was better in terms of price, the uncertainty associated with it made it almost impossible for us to consider.

I called JT Kim of the KDIC before 8 am to inform him there were two competing offers. He asked me a number of questions. After mulling things over, he agreed HSBC's offer with certainty was better.

Blum, Bonderman, Carroll, and I, along with a few others, jumped on an internal conference call to discuss. Blum was somewhat upset that I had even checked with the KDIC regarding the two bids, because he did not want us to risk being told no. He felt we should sell KFB to HSBC regardless of what StanChart came back with, because he had already cut a deal with Bond at $3.05 billion. Even though we thought StanChart might improve its offer, we all agreed a deal was a deal if struck by Blum. We would proceed with HSBC.

However, although we had completed most of the work on our documentation with StanChart in our meeting at Allen & Overy, there were still a number of outstanding issues with the sales and purchase agreement with HSBC. The problem was that HSBC was never in a hurry. It just did not have a sense of urgency. We could not afford to lose the StanChart offer and also fail to conclude a deal with HSBC because of the failure to reach agreement on outstanding issues in the document. Bonderman told me that the deal with HSBC had only 24 hours' exclusivity. If HSBC did not complete the transaction with us in that time, we would be free to accept a better bid.

I called Chandra at about 9 am to tell him what had transpired overnight between Blum and Bond. Chandra was incredulous and said he had not heard anything. I requested to meet with him as soon as possible and also asked his banking colleagues to meet with Cohen to work out the transition agreement, which still contained many issues Cohen had not agreed to. But Chandra later called Poon to say he could meet with me only at 4 pm, because he needed confirmation from London regarding the agreement between Bond and Blum. I was surprised that Bond had not communicated with his own team. At this rate, I very much doubted if HSBC would be able to conclude the final agreement in 24 hours.

At about 3 pm, Stileman reached me on my mobile. It was only 6 am in London, where he was. I told him that we could not accept the uncertainty in StanChart's offer. He replied that they were working on removing all the conditions in the offer, but I remained skeptical that they would be able make it fully unconditional. I spoke with a couple investment bankers, including Mike O'Hanlon of Lehman, to see if they thought StanChart could get a bank to “hard, firm, and unconditionally” underwrite its stock offering to finance this deal. A “hard, firm, and unconditional” underwriting was an obligation by the underwriter to either raise the capital from the market or provide the capital itself. Everyone I spoke with thought the odds of Standard Chartered arranging such a deal were long. I thought that even if HSBC missed the 24-hour deadline, there was little chance of StanChart following through on what Stileman was offering.

When I met with Chandra at 4 pm, he said he had received a one-line email from Douglas Flint, HSBC's Group Finance Director, to confirm that $3.050 billion “is consistent with our understanding.” Chandra came with his lawyers from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, a London-based law firm with a big practice in Hong Kong. The team of lawyers included Teresa Ko, a senior partner and capable lawyer whom I knew well. The meeting was reasonably smooth. I reminded Chandra that the deal with them would be valid for 24 hours, although by then they had spent almost a whole day waiting for London's confirmation. Furthermore, the HSBC team would only be able to meet with Cohen in Seoul the next day, adding another day to the clock. Based on my experience working with HSBC, I thought it unlikely that they would be able to get there in 48 hours, let alone 24. At this pace, HSBC would certainly miss the window, but its team betrayed no urgency.

Later that day, I got a call from Stan Chow, a lawyer at Allen & Overy, who told me StanChart had just received a waiver from the Hong Kong stock exchange, exempting it from the need for shareholders' approval for the deal. This removed a huge uncertainty from StanChart's offer, but it still had to find an investment bank to hard underwrite its stock offering. It seemed that while HSBC was still taking its time, StanChart was rushing and making every effort to remove all conditions from its offer.

I sent the following email to Stileman before going to bed, laying out what it would take for us to seriously consider StanChart's offer:

David,

I may have gone to bed by the time your 2:30 pm meeting is over. I am very appreciative of the fact that you are making such an effort. As I mentioned, your price is slightly better than your competition but, candidly, does not justify the risk we will have to take. My own view is that there are probably two ways, either of which will get us there. I know that neither is easy. The first, needless to say, is to give us complete certainty, e.g., if some bank hard underwrites the offering. In the absence of such certainty, it probably will require a combination of substantial reduction of risks, as you are trying to do, and an improvement in price, which I think Mervyn spoke with Bonderman about. Please note that I am not trying to negotiate at all. I just wish to give you my candid view from where I stand and hope it helps. I know that Mervyn will speak with David Bonderman again today. I sincerely hope that they can work something out between themselves before I wake up! I spoke with David just now and he is most up to date. He says that he will be going into town but is reachable by his mobile phone. As you must have gathered, he is very straightforward. Please work with him.

Shan



I called Bonderman as soon as I got up on Wednesday, December 22. He said that StanChart was working hard to get someone to unconditionally underwrite its stock offering, which would remove a significant element of uncertainty in its offer. At about 7:45 am Hong Kong time, I called Stileman in London but apparently woke him up. He sounded annoyed and grouchy, even though he had sent me an email overnight asking me to call him at any time. He mumbled that they would give us certainty and I let him go back to sleep.

According to Bonderman, StanChart was working with UBS to see if UBS could unconditionally underwrite StanChart's stock offering. Later in the day, Stileman sent me an email explaining that he had only six hours of sleep since Saturday, four days ago. He had been working extremely hard and the StanChart team was really making a great effort. He also sent me a new draft offer letter. There were a number of changes. Whereas the previous letter included a press release to be sent out once we accepted the offer, the new one required confidentiality and silence, probably because of the regulatory requirement ahead of a stock offering. Whereas the previous letter would give StanChart the right to walk if its stock price fell below 900 pence per share, that reference was removed, pending confirmation that UBS would hard underwrite the offering.

I thought we had to bring this process to a close by imposing a deadline on both bidders. I informed both HSBC and StanChart that we had to sign the final documents by 5 pm the next day, December 23, which would be the fifth anniversary of signing of our definitive agreements for the KFB purchase. I wanted both of them to have completed the documentation and provided us with a firm and binding offer by then.

As December 22 ticked by, StanChart kept working hard to improve its offer. We received a number of drafts of its offer letter, each one removing more conditions. By the end of the day, practically all the conditions in StanChart's offer were removed. I faxed a copy of the last draft offer letter from StanChart to Bonderman and told him to anticipate a call from Mervyn Davies.

Blum was getting anxious about HSBC, which was still taking its time. He was concerned we would not be able to finalize a deal with it. He asked me to tell Chandra to hurry up so we could close the door before anyone else could come in.

HSBC remained uncompromising on a number of issues in the document, and it had let the deadline pass without giving us a binding deal. At one point, Chandra had sent me an email in which he indicated HSBC was prepared to give us an offer in terms of Korean won, but someone at the bank subsequently changed their mind and the offer was rescinded. Nevertheless, Chandra kept repeating that HSBC had kept its side of the bargain, even as it continued to let deadlines lapse.

“We believe we have kept our word on the Purchase Price and have given you a deal which has certainty of completion,” he concluded in an email I received on the morning of December 20. “As our deal does not contain any surprises and is therefore in a form which can readily be accepted by you, we are unable to extend the acceptance deadline unless you can offer us exclusivity.”

His “acceptance deadline” had passed while we were meeting later that day. Now I had to tell him to hurry. I had to make it clear that the window was fast closing and it would be their own fault if they could not come through within the allotted time. Further, I could not let stand his insinuation that HSBC had kept its word but we did not keep ours. I said in my response:

Referring to the last paragraph of your email, I also wish to assure you that we have kept our word on all the understandings between us, including keeping to each of the deadlines agreed between us. As you recall, we agreed to a price and we granted you an exclusivity period at the end of which we were supposed to give certainty to each other of a transaction at the price agreed. As you were not in a position to give us certainty of a deal as we had mutually envisioned when your exclusivity expired, we agreed that that we would begin a competitive process in which you would participate. In other words, the deal that we had originally agreed to was off at that point by mutual understanding. Once we are through a competitive process, not only do we have a fiduciary duty to our limited partners, but also to our Korean Government shareholders, to take the best offer. We have kept and will always keep our word.



Hong Kong had been caught up in the holiday spirit for weeks. As a Chinese city, Hong Kong celebrates all the Chinese traditional holidays, such as Chinese New Year, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and Buddha's Birthday. But as a former British colony, it also celebrates major Western holidays, including Christmas and New Year's. It used to celebrate the queen's birthday, a holiday that was shifted back a few weeks to become Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day after the return of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997.

Immediately after Thanksgiving, all the tall buildings facing Victoria Harbour put up decorative neon lights, with giant images of Santa Claus, reindeer, and shining stars running their entire height. At night, the colorful lights on both sides of the harbor lit up the entire waterfront, their reflections dancing on the waves as if there were a fairytale world under the water. But by Thursday, December 23, with Christmas only two days away, Central was a lot quieter than usual. Many people, especially foreign expatriates, had already left for holidays elsewhere. We were still working hard, however.

I woke up before 5 am to find that StanChart had come through overnight with a firm and unconditional underwriting by its banker, UBS, for a stock offering of some $2 billion. Combined with the cash on its balance sheet, this would give it enough money to do the deal and removed yet another element of uncertainty from its offer.

I sent to my colleagues a copy of the drag-along language from our agreement with the Korean government, to remind them that we had a duty to our shareholders. I remembered the terms we had agonized over during our negotiations, whether to say the drag-along was to “enable” or “allow” the maximization of shareholder value. Either way, now that the time was upon us, our duty was clear. We had to inform both bidders that we were under a contractual obligation with the Korean government to take the best offer, lest they have any illusions we might play favorites. Of course, we would value certainty even above price because we could not afford for the sale to fall through, certainly not after the sale process had become public knowledge.

I finished my run at about 8:30 am, just when our conference call was scheduled to start. I did not have time to get home and dialed in from my car parked at the entrance of the running trail. Blum, Bonderman, Carroll, and Poon were on the call, as was BM Park from Kim & Chang. We went over the two offers in detail. StanChart's bid stood at 3.3 trillion won, or $3.128 billion. HSBC's offer was at $3.05 billion. We debated for over an hour among ourselves which way to go.

StanChart's offer was higher, but it required us to sign the definitive documents during the week of January 10, three weeks away and into the new year. StanChart wanted to sign and announce the deal and do the stock offering to finance it at the same time. It thought that making an announcement today would require it to consolidate KFB's financial results into its own for this year, which would significantly and unnecessarily complicate its regulatory filings.

Blum favored the HSBC deal regardless, based on his handshake with Bond, even though HSBC was not able to close the deal in the agreed 24-hour window. Bonderman also thought we should go with HSBC, calling the $78 million difference in price “a rounding error” that did not justify the risk. I agreed. Certainty around closing the deal was more important. I knew that the KDIC would not object, because the Korean government had expressed a preference for HSBC and considered it a bigger bank globally. The KDIC probably would also agree that certainty would trump the “rounding error” in price.

But StanChart's price was higher and it had been working extremely hard and expediently to remove uncertainty. It would be unfair not to give it a chance to remove the remaining conditions from its offer. If StanChart was able to match HSBC's offer on certainty, its bid would be better, although only marginally so in the grand scheme of things. If we allowed StanChart a chance to make its offer unconditional, we should also give HSBC an equal chance to put its best foot forward. We concluded that it would be fair if we requested both parties to put their best bids on the table. We would make a final decision the next day.

I set up a meeting with Chandra for 2 pm at the office of Freshfields, which was the law firm advising HSBC. I arrived there at 1:50.

As I was parking my car, I received a call from Stileman, who had just woken up in London. I told him what we had decided this morning. He was disappointed. I told him that his team's offer was better, but by a “rounding error,” in Bonderman's words. I also told him that when HSBC first made us an offer, it was a higher price in Korean won terms (approximately 3,480 billion won by the exchange rate at that time), but the movement in the exchange rate meant its offer was actually lower than StanChart's today.

Stileman speculated that HSBC's offer was 3,200 billion won. I knew he was fishing for any hint as to what HSBC's number was, but I did not take the bait. In my mind, we needed to be fair to both parties, and it would not be fair to HSBC if I shopped, or disclosed, its actual bid to a competitor. I just said “absolutely not” without giving him any further indication.

Stileman was not going to give up on Standard Chartered's bid and said he was going to speak with his CEO. I offered that they should speak with Bonderman as well.

When we were gathered in the Freshfields office at 2:20 pm, I asked all the lawyers to leave the room, as I wanted to have a private moment with Chandra.

I said to him that HSBC’s price was lower and that it was denominated in the wrong currency (dollars as opposed to won), even though just a few days ago he had said HSBC could price it in Korean won. I also told him that we would like to do a deal with HSBC, because of the certainty it would bring, but that as HSBC dragged the negotiations on, its competition had largely removed the uncertainties in its competing offer.

After this conversation, Chandra droppped two unresolved issues related to the severance payments to management and the reference to the possible need for approval from the Public Fund Oversight Committee. But he still insisted HSBC's offer be priced in dollars, not in won. The meeting was adjourned at about 3 pm.

A couple of hours later, Stileman called me. Mervyn Davies wanted to talk with Bonderman to give him a better offer, but he would need an instantaneous response. I sent him an email later to tell him that I thought it was unlikely Bonderman would be able to provide an instantaneous answer unless the offer either gave us complete certainty or was overwhelmingly better than the competition. I also laid out a number of issues that remained open between us. I wrote a memo to Blum and Bonderman to report my meeting with Chandra that afternoon. By the time I got home, it was late, and Bin and the children had already finished dinner.

Bonderman called me that night at about 9:45 pm. I told him about my discussion with Stileman and we got on a conference call with the StanChart people an hour later. On the call Davies said StanChart was prepared to give us a new offer but asked what process we had in mind. Bonderman responded that we would need to make a decision tomorrow, but they could wait for a day to give us the offer. This was to give assurance to StanChart we would not shop its bid. I suggested that we speak again at 10 am Hong Kong time the next day, which would be 2 am London time. It appeared clear that StanChart was prepared to up the ante. This was getting more interesting, I thought, as I went to bed that night.

On Christmas Eve, I got up before 5 am to review the final documents for HSBC. Then I spoke with Bonderman by phone. He was back in Aspen. As it happened, Blum was there for Christmas as well, as was Bond, who also had a home there and had already arrived from London. Blum and Bonderman had set up a meeting with Bond for later that day.

I left for the office at about 7:30 am to attend a KFB board meeting via video conference. The purpose of the meeting was to approve the transition agreements with HSBC and StanChart respectively. We did not know which of the two bidders would win out, so we needed the board to approve both of them. The transition agreements laid out a set of rules to govern how KFB would be managed during the transition period between the signing of final agreements and the formal closing, at which time we would receive payment and no longer have any involvement with the bank. It was uncertain how long that period would be, because any sale of a bank required regulatory approvals, which would take time. However, we expected there would not be any problems obtaining them in view of the qualifications of HSBC and StanChart, both of which were large international financial institutions.

There was one nay vote and one abstention among the directors representing the government. I assumed the reason was to save the need to go back to their respective institutions to ask for approval, since the board meeting was called on short notice. They also knew their votes would not affect the result. Otherwise, the transition agreements were approved, as the rest of the board all voted aye.

Blum and Bonderman called to say that they had met with Bond at his Aspen home. Blum had arrived first, about half an hour earlier than Bonderman, and handed Bond the memo I had written recording my meeting with Chandra and his team the day before. The memo set the record straight that we had honored the exclusivity agreement with HSBC. According to Bonderman, Bond was somewhat unhappy and a little snappy. Even though our co-chairmen extended a goodwill gesture with a personal visit and invited HSBC to give us the best offer it could, they were met with a cold shoulder. Even the cheery Christmas atmosphere in snowy Aspen was not enough to produce a pleasant meeting.

At 10 am, Bonderman and I got on a scheduled conference call with the Standard Chartered team. Those on the call represented the top brass of StanChart: Davies, Sands, and Stileman, plus their board director, Gareth Bullock, and their financial advisors. Bryan Sanderson, StanChart's chairman, was also personally involved in the process, having spoken with Bonderman multiple times, even though he was not on the call. The call began at 2 am in London, where the StanChart people were. I was impressed by their willingness to do the call so early in the morning on Christmas Eve, or so late at night, depending how you look at it.

It seemed that StanChart was pulling out all the stops to win this deal. This stood in sharp contrast with the approach of HSBC, which lacked internal coordination between Bond and his team, not to mention flexibility, and sense of urgency even in the face of an agreed deadline and a fast-moving competitive situation.

Davies started the call by asking how long it would take us to get back to them if they gave us a new offer. Bonderman said two hours, then he offered to let them delay the call for another hour. Bonderman was again signaling that we would not shop their bid. What he wanted to do was to spend the next hour getting HSBC's best offer, so that when StanChart executives gave us theirs, we could do a quick comparison and make a decision. So we agreed to schedule another call with Standard Chartered at 11:25 am, or 3:25 am London time.

At the same time, Blum spoke with Bond again by phone. Bond increased the price by $25 million to $3.075 billion, which was not enough to move the needle. In fact, in Korean won terms, it was literally nothing, because one day's appreciation in the won's exchange rate would wipe out this gain entirely.

HSBC had been trying to buy a bank in Korea since 1998. Its team had spent months working on this transaction. Now HSBC was in a preferred position to win. Its team members knew that this was their last chance. Yet they were willing to risk losing the deal at the last minute for less than a rounding error. I was amazed and began to understand why HSBC had not been successful in its acquisition attempts in Korea. It seemed that it was only suited to win if it was the only buyer, with a desperate seller.

The 11:25 am call was brief. Davies requested postponement for another hour, to 1 pm (5 am London time). However, Stileman called back half an hour later to say they were ready. My 21-year-old son, Bo, was home for Christmas. He was studying economics at the University of Chicago and was always interested in investments. I invited him to listen in on the call. I knew this was it—show time—and Bo would probably get a kick out of listening to some top business leaders conclude a multi-billion-dollar deal.

I did not know what StanChart would come up with at this final moment, but I expected it to step up. At such a critical point on such a big deal, nobody was going to throw out a number that did not make a meaningful difference, unless he did not care to win. It appeared that StanChart cared enough.

Standard Chartered, Davies said, would offer 3.4 trillion won for KFB and would remove all remaining conditions to provide certainty that the deal would close. This new offer was about $100 million more than StanChart's last one. We said we would get back to them in an hour and adjourned the meeting.

Bonderman, Blum, and I spoke with Matthew Ginsburg and Jason Shin of Morgan Stanley to debrief them on the offers we had received. Morgan Stanley was still the financial advisor to the Korean government, as it had been at the beginning of our encounter with KFB in 1998. Even though we did not need the government's approval to make a decision, we wanted to consult with them as a matter of courtesy. Jason felt that pricing in Korean won was helpful, and the gap was sufficiently large to tilt the balance in favor of StanChart. However, the government would support the deal either way, as we'd expected.

At about 12:40 pm, I called Stileman to ask him to send me StanChart's draft final offer letter for review, to see if there were any issues we could not agree to. Once it arrived, I reviewed it word by word. Everything seemed to be in order, with the price still blank. When we resumed the call at 1 pm, Bonderman said, “Gentlemen, congratulations. You have won the bid.”

Then he complimented them for having “played so skillfully that you didn't leave a penny on the table.”

Indeed, if StanChart had not improved its offer in such a meaningful way on our last call, the deal might very well have gone the other way. HSBC had been the preferred bidder all along, from Newbridge's perspective, especially in view of Blum's relationship with Bond. It was preferred by the Korean government as well. StanChart just made us an offer we could not refuse.

Stileman faxed me the executed offer letter. It took me almost 15 minutes and three tries, dialing numbers he had given me, to fax my executed copy back to him. At this point in the deal process, everyone was anxious to see a signature on the dotted line, so the delay was unnerving. I imagined Stileman staring at his fax machine waiting for my document to arrive. Finally, I got through and watched as the last signed page slid through the fax machine. Now I imagined it spooling out the other end, into Stileman's eager hands.

The deal was done. The difference between StanChart's price of 3.4 trillion won and HSBC's price of $3.075 billion was about $175 million at the day's exchange rate. We had gained about $250 million since we began the auction process and stood to gain more if the Korean won continued to strengthen. A competitive process, even a limited one, does wonders for a seller.

If I had been HSBC, I would have done everything possible to deliver an agreement as promised at the expiration of exclusivity, without risking getting into an auction. It would have secured KFB for $250 million less than what we wound up selling for. But HSBC's bureaucracy prevented it from moving quickly and decisively, even though all members of its team were top-rate professionals.

The sale process, however, had been extremely exhausting. Poon, who once again supported me with a careful review of all the legal papers as he had done when we bought the bank, probably slept less than one night in five days. He was so meticulous, and so capable, that I knew he would not miss the slightest error in any of the voluminous documents—even on hardly any sleep.

We held one more conference call, this time with Cohen, the KFB CEO, and Duncan Parker, his COO. Bonderman, Blum, Poon, and I informed Cohen and Parker of what had transpired and that StanChart had won the bid to acquire our bank. I also issued a gag order on the call for all, in deference to StanChart's wishes, until StanChart was ready to announce it.

We had signed the definitive agreement to acquire KFB on December 23, 1999. We signed the legally binding letter to sell it on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2004, five years and one day later. The concluded deals, buying or selling, were big Christmas gifts for all of us.

KFB was a successful investment for Newbridge Capital and its investors. Together, the Korean government and Newbridge had invested 1 trillion won, or less than $900 million, five years earlier. Because the sale was priced in Korean won, which continued its ascent while we were waiting for regulatory approvals, we received about $3.3 billion when the transaction with Standard Chartered Bank finally closed. To show our appreciation of the Korean government and society, after the deal closed, we made a donation of $20 million to charitable organizations in the country (Exhibit 17 and 18).

The only investor that did not make money was SoftBank. It had decided to sell its stake in KFB two years into the investment, possibly because it had not anticipated how long it would take to turn around a bank and did not have the patience or the confidence to wait. SoftBank's stake was bought by Cerberus Capital, another private equity firm, for less than SoftBank had paid. As a result, Cerberus made more money than other investors in the deal or more than SoftBank would have made if SoftBank had stayed in. But that was good for Newbridge Capital, because we received a percentage of an investor's capital gain as our fee, so the more money Cerberus made, the better off we were.

The bank we handed over to StanChart was healthy and strong. We had doubled its assets and made it very profitable. The StanChart team told me that our risk management system at KFB was better than its own. Both the seller and the buyer were happy with the transaction. StanChart eventually changed the name of the bank to Standard Chartered First Bank, relegating the name and the story of Korea First Bank to history.
