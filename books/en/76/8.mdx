title: 8 The Chairman Takes Charge
---






Director General Noh had thrown a tantrum.

Ambassador Hyun was being characteristically understated when he called me on the afternoon of July 2. Noh had complained to Chairman Lee, saying that Newbridge was insulting the government by issuing an ultimatum, which was how he characterized my suggestion for a meeting in an hour. He was also upset with some legal terms our lawyers put in the term sheet and accused us of imposing such terms on the government. Hearing this, Chairman Lee flew into a rage at Newbridge.

As Ambassador Hyun explained what had happened, I was stunned. I thought both Lee's and Noh's reactions were completely unreasonable. We had not pushed them to meet with us or issued anything close to an ultimatum. We had suggested a meeting in a respectful manner, which seemed a logical next step. Especially when we were both working toward a deadline. I did not know if Noh was simply being capricious or if he was using this as an excuse to scuttle our deal.

In any case, Noh still wanted to meet, and it was a disaster from the start. Suddenly, the attitude of the FSC team had totally changed. Noh used the occasion to dress us down, repeatedly accusing us of “distorting” the words of their chairman. Throughout the meeting, Noh ranted and refused to discuss anything substantive. I was hoping he would calm down after venting and get back to business. But he never did, and went on grandstanding until abruptly declaring the meeting adjourned around midnight. He requested that we reconvene at 9:30 the next morning.

Blum, Bonderman, and the rest of our team were expecting word that we had signed a binding term sheet. Mystified at the unfortunate turn of events, I scribbled a note of what had transpired before going to bed, shortly before 2 am.

The next day, we met with Noh and his team again. But Noh was not interested in discussing any substantive issues. Instead, he only made statements, without suggesting anything constructive. While making these grand pronouncements he would stare toward the ceiling, his eyes rolled up in his head, “like those of a dead fish,” I scribbled down in my notes. I felt we were wasting our time.

As if that were not enough, other members of the FSC team began to raise issues with the terms they'd agreed to the evening before. They challenged the basic premise and terms of the MOU. The gap between our two sides rapidly grew larger and larger. As the morning session came to an end, we counted 20 new issues raised by the FSC team.

We all felt frustrated. We did not know if the FSC was playing a game or if it was serious. Regardless, reaching an agreement looked unlikely now. Ambassador Hyun explained to Chairman Lee that what Noh had reported to him was simply not true. After that, Lee purportedly calmed down, but I did not know what to do next, because I felt it was impossible to negotiate anything with Noh. The gap between our two sides that had nearly closed just a few days ago was now so wide that we could hardly see the other side.

On July 4, we received an update on the U.S.-South Korea summit meeting in Washington. President Kim had informed President Clinton that the KFB deal was concluded, and the two had congratulated each other. It seemed that the die was cast, at least politically; this transaction had to happen. But that was not the situation on the ground. Paradoxically, with the presidential meeting behind us, we had lost a major impetus to move things forward.

Our team prepared another copy of the term sheet overnight, taking into consideration the latest issues raised by the FSC. We wanted to get the document ready before our 2 pm meeting.

However, the FSC repeatedly postponed the meeting. A little after 7 pm, I went to go to meet with Ambassador Hyun in his office to let him know what had happened and to discuss our next move.

While I was there, the FSC summoned our team to its office. My colleagues went without me. Sometime after 10 pm Paul Chen called me from the FSC, to tell me that, once again, there was a new issue. The FSC was now demanding that the government retain control of the bank after the sale.

This was a preposterous and shocking suggestion, under the circumstances. It ran counter to the basic premise of the deal, which was that the foreign investor would control the bank and introduce a new credit culture to the Korean financial system. This new demand was as absurd as if a car dealer sold you a car and then insisted that he drive it. I thought Noh had finally lost his mind.

The director general had apparently been driving his own team crazy all day with new demands and was now asking that Newbridge accept a whole swath of new conditions on the deal, including the government’s equal representation on the board, participation in management appointments, and approval for all loans over 5 billion won (about $4 million). I instructed Chen that the whole team should walk out of the meeting in a polite, calm, and measured manner. There was nothing left to negotiate.

Chen informed the FSC team that their new proposed changes altered the fundamental premise of this transaction, and that we had to go back to speak with our chairmen to think about the whole deal anew. Astonishingly, Noh was shocked at this reaction and tried strenuously to prevent our team from leaving.

“It seems that Mr. Noh is making an ever-stronger effort for us not to take him seriously,” I noted in an update to Bonderman later that night.

* * *

I was out for my morning run the next day when Bonderman called. I briefly discussed with him what actions to take under the circumstances. By the time I'd returned to my hotel room, Bonderman had sent me a draft letter addressed to Chairman Lee, requesting in strong terms that Lee remove Noh from the negotiations. When I showed it to Ambassador Hyun, he told me delicately that he did not think it would be helpful, and proceeded to modify it until it didn't sound like Bonderman anymore. But I decided to accept his more diplomatic approach.

The ambassador met with Chairman Lee. The chairman did not get into any of the new issues raised by Noh; nor did he respond to Bonderman's request to remove Noh. Lee had two major requests of his own. The first was that Newbridge increase the amount of its investment to a total of $700 million, from $600 million he had previously proposed, consisting of an initial $500 million, followed by $100 million in each of the two years following. The second was that the government not be required to provide three-year protection for loans that would mature after two years.

To his first point, I decided to write the chairman a letter explaining that we could consider such investments, but there had to be conditions. To the second point, BM Park of Kim & Chang suggested that we could follow the same arrangement we'd established for the work-out loans in our earlier term sheet, which was to subject them to a buy/sell process at maturity. I concurred.

* * *

“There is good and bad news today,” I wrote to the team after the ambassador had met with Chairman Lee and his team that Wednesday, July 7. A number of the issues that remained on the table were resolved, and on several, Lee accepted our position against the objections of his team. On other issues, however, Lee appeared to have had second thoughts.

The main one was the issue of “due care.” The FSC side wanted to insert a clause into our agreement that Newbridge would be obliged to “exercise due care” in its management of the bank. There was, of course, no question that we would, as would any prudent shareholder. In fact, the commercial code of South Korea required it. But our lawyers objected to having this written in as a contractual obligation to another party. They worried that it exposed us to legal risk. If we left it up to the government to rule on due care in this case, they might arbitrarily decide that we'd failed to exercise it.

We were comfortable adding a due care clause as a nonbinding side letter accompanying the agreement, since that would just entail our following the law, and any disputes would be resolved in court. A day earlier, Chairman Lee said he would be happy with a side letter. But Noh, supported by the FSC's White & Case lawyer, Eric Yoon, objected. They claimed, falsely, that Newbridge had a bad track record on due care. They alleged that there had been a dispute over a lack of due care involving Bonderman's previous deal for American Savings Bank. (There had not been.) “Lee, having been convinced by his team, now seems to go back to the inclusion of the due care clause in the term sheet,” I wrote in my update. “This is obviously unacceptable to us.”

Another serious issue was Chairman Lee's request to increase our share of the capital contribution. His terms from the day before still stood, with the minor alteration that he had changed currencies and was now asking us to invest 500 billion won initially and an additional 100 billion won in each of the following two years (approximately $500 million and $100 million respectively). Our concern, however, was that the bank's balance sheet had shrunk so much after its failure and nationalization that this was far more capital than it required. If we overinvested, it would reduce the rate of return we could generate on that capital.

It was a matter of economics. If a bank with a capital base of $1 billion generates $120 million in profits, the return on capital is 12 percent. If the capital base is increased to $1.2 billion but the profit remains $120 million, the return on capital drops to 10 percent.

After some discussion, Lee agreed to drop his request that Newbridge contribute an additional 100 billion won in each of the following two years. But he remained adamant on the initial 500 billion, and he would not consider any measure that would dilute the government's ownership of the bank below 49 percent in exchange for Newbridge's increased payment. “Newbridge has pointed out a number of deal breakers over the course of our negotiations,” the chairman told Ambassador Hyun. “This is the only deal breaker from me.”

O'Hanlon and his team at Lehman Brothers came up with a number of potential solutions to address the issue, such as putting the excess capital in the form of a preferred stock that would pay a special dividend or using it to buy back the stock in KFB from the government. But those were unlikely to fly with Chairman Lee. Ultimately, however, I did not think the issue was insurmountable. If the bank could increase its total assets fast, making more new loans in an environment of economic recovery, we would be able to literally grow our way out of this problem. The bank's profit would grow in tandem with its total assets. However, if we increased the amount of capital contribution for our 51 percent, the government would have to increase its capital contribution for its 49 percent. If Newbridge alone increased its capital contribution, then our ownership would have to increase and the government's ownership would have to be diluted. What I would not agree to was to unilaterally increase our capital contribution without getting anything in return.

* * *

We let Chairman Lee know that we were willing to consider the incremental investment he requested but no other issues. We also informed him that I had to leave the country on Sunday, for Europe on a business trip, so we hoped we could finalize the term sheet before then.

Late Saturday evening, I spoke with Director Kang of the FSC. He was in the middle of negotiating with our lawyers from Kim & Chang, and told me he was extremely tired from the endless meetings and work. The FSC team was working as hard as we were, and I really felt for him. I learned later that his meeting with our lawyers lasted until about 2:30 am.

The next morning, I awoke to a fine, sunny day. It was a welcome change after several days of clouds and heavy rain. We had been working so hard and had spent so much of our days in office buildings and hotel conference rooms that I had hardly noticed the change of seasons, I realized. The fine weather of early spring was long gone, and Seoul in July was hot and humid. Korean business etiquette required that I wear a formal suit and tie to every meeting, which was uncomfortable in the midsummer heat. When meetings went long and things did not go well for us, it was unbearable.

A voicemail from Ambassador Hyun was awaiting me. After Chairman Lee learned I planned to leave town, he called to ask Hyun to hold me back. Lee said that the deal should be done by Monday or Tuesday at the latest. The subtext, we both knew, was that if negotiations broke off now, the deal might be indefinitely postponed. It was difficult to change my flight, but I managed to postpone my departure by 24 hours in the hope of concluding the deal.

That Sunday, July 11, we marshaled all our forces—including our team from Newbridge, the bankers from Lehman Brothers, and the lawyers from Cleary Gottlieb—and went to Kim & Chang's office for a conference with Ambassador Hyun and his colleagues. KS Chung and BM Park, both partners of Kim & Chang, had been negotiating with BS Kang until 2:30 am, so we were anxious to get an update on what had been agreed to and what remained unresolved.

Once we had determined where we stood on various open issues, KS Chung and BM Park went to meet with Chairman Lee to continue negotiating on our behalf. The rest of us went to a restaurant on a hill behind the Blue House to have dinner. It was in a traditional Korean house with a large terrace and an expansive lawn, affording magnificent views of the mountains, the Blue House, and the city of Seoul. The air was cool and fresh, even though it was midsummer. It was the first time in a long time we had been able to enjoy a relaxed dinner in beautiful surroundings.

I went back to Kim & Chang's office after dinner to meet with Ambassador Hyun, KS Chung, and BM Park. The two lawyers had just returned from their visit with Chairman Lee and reported that he had not changed his position on the issues. He did, however, invite me to meet with him privately at 9:30 the following morning. The chairman still seemed strongly in favor of getting some kind of deal done. “I will do it even if I have to go to hell,” he told KS Chung and BM Park.

Although we did not appreciate it at the time, Chairman Lee was under intense pressure. He later recalled in his memoirs that he received a fax from a senior secretary to President DJ Kim in late June saying: “Please cooperate to complete the sale of Korea First Bank before the President's visit to the U.S.” President Kim was growing frustrated with the lack of progress on the deal. But the rumors going around the Blue House at that time were that Chairman Lee himself was the reason for the delay and that his officials at the FSC were deliberately sabotaging the sale. The pressure was on him to make sure the deal happened. However, overseeing the KFB sale exposed Lee to the risk of political ruin. Even if he cut the best deal he could, would anyone remember how grave the crisis was once the bank turned around?

“People would soon ask, ‘Why was a functioning bank sold at a fire-sale price?’” he recounted in his memoir, fearing “The person responsible for the sale would be labeled an unpatriotic traitor.” Still, the international community was watching. If the KFB talks collapsed, so would the market. Korea's economic reform efforts would lose all credibility. “If I sell the bank, I will be finished,” he told his closest staff members. “If I don't, the country will be in a shambles.”

I slept for a fitful five hours and rose before dawn on Monday, July 12, to get ready for my meeting with Chairman Lee. To do so, I reviewed materials our team, including those from Lehman and Cleary, had worked through the night to prepare. I had a call with Bonderman before going for a half-hour run to clear my head.

After breakfast, I left the hotel for Kim & Chang's office, where I met up with Ambassador Hyun and KS Chung. After a brief discussion, Hyun and I went to meet Chairman Lee in the Korea Federation of Banks Building located in Myeong-dong in the center of the city's business district. Myeong-dong's architecture was a mix of nondescript concrete high-rises and commercial low-rises. Most of the buildings were relatively new and modest in their appearance, with little that distinguished one from another. But the Korea Federation of Banks Building stood out. It was older, constructed in a Western style with an imposing façade. We walked through grand heavy doors like those in old banks, built to impress customers. The lobby was spacious, and the meeting rooms gave the impression of a bygone era. We got there to find Chairman Lee already waiting in what looked like a small reception room.

The room was relatively dark. Lee sat cross-legged in a big chair, with his feet tucked up beneath him. Although he wore a serious expression, he seemed at ease, and I was happy to see him assume such a casual pose. Koreans can be among the world's most formal people in business settings. Their posture is often ramrod straight. Junior staff will not even cross their legs in front of their superiors. Seeing Lee relaxed meant he felt comfortable and was not going to treat me as an outsider.

There were only three of us in the room. I sat facing Lee in an armchair to his left. Ambassador Hyun took the seat on Lee's right. We immediately proceeded to talk through the open issues, which I read off one by one from a document I had brought with me. Once we dealt with one issue, we moved on to another.

We kept going like that, without interruption, for about five hours, with a quick pause for lunch. I was impressed that the chairman seemed to have a better understanding of certain issues than the FSC staff members we had been negotiating with. It seemed to me that the chairman was making an effort to get the deal done. As we ticked off one item after another, he occasionally chatted in Korean with the ambassador, who told me later that the chairman lamented, several times, that he did not have a competent staff to help him.

I soon discovered a pattern: The chairman was more concerned about issues with regulatory implications than monetary ones. In sharp contrast with Noh, Lee listened to my arguments and explained his own rationale. The two of us could persuade each other with reason and logic. It was such a pleasure to negotiate with a counterparty whom I could reason with—and make progress with—especially after several months of stonewalling by the FSC team. Together, Lee and I managed to reach a tentative agreement on several major issues. These included the selection of initial assets before closing, how to treat and define payment defaults, and the handling of long-term loans.

On the last point Lee impressed me by volunteering that the problem with financial institution loans was that essentially bankrupt financial institutions could survive by continuing to pay interest even if they were not able to pay principal, which was exactly our side's point when Noh insisted such loans should be treated as normal. Now, without being asked, he suggested that any financial institution loans with maturities of more than two years should be treated like work-out loans, meaning they would be subject to three-year protection by the government.

Before we were able to finish my issue list, Lee said he had to leave for another meeting. During our discussion, as we resolved one issue after another, I took notes, but he did not; neither did Ambassador Hyun. For five hours Lee never took out a single piece of paper to look at or to write on. Before we adjourned I said, “Chairman Lee, how do you remember all the things we have discussed to inform your own team of what we have agreed?”

“Just give a copy of your notes to them and ask them to follow what we have agreed,” he said, looking straight into my eyes. There was no hesitation in his facial expression.

I was quite surprised. While I appreciated his trust, I was afraid my shorthand might be illegible to anyone else. Also, I remembered the meeting between Lee and our co-chairmen in Hong Kong, after which he disavowed what they had agreed to even though it was recorded in Bonderman's minutes. I did not want to take any chances.

“How about if I read my notes back to you to see if your understanding is the same?” I asked.

He agreed. After I finished reading my notes, he said, “Good. Ambassador Hyun, please make sure my team receives a copy of these notes.”

I was impressed by how Chairman Lee conducted this meeting.

* * *

There was no closure or agreement on the term sheet at the end of the 24-hour extension of my stay. There was no telling when the FSC team would get back to us to confirm agreement on all the issues I had discussed with Chairman Lee. The next day, July 13, I left Seoul for Europe empty-handed, other than my bags, that is.

While traveling I wrote to my colleagues, updating them on yet another round of changes from the FSC and their lawyers: “We have witnessed a disturbing pattern of reaching a business agreement with the chairman only to have White & Case reject our language.” In order to keep things moving smoothly, the ambassador agreed to speak with Chairman Lee and encourage him to instruct Eric Yoon of White & Case to make comments based only on the business understanding rather than what Yoon believed the terms should be.

Wondering if my presence might make a difference, I offered to fly back to Seoul to meet with Chairman Lee to resolve all the remaining issues. A couple of times during my trip Lee requested that I return to Seoul immediately, but each time, shortly before I was about to get onto a flight, he called back to say it was unnecessary. I was puzzled about what the FSC was up to. The tempo of our engagement had noticeably slowed down. It seemed that the pressure on the FSC to do a deal had cooled off now that the presidential visit to America was concluded. I thought we had to find another way to push them.

While on the road, I received yet another letter from the FSC complaining that the language of our draft document did not reflect the understanding reached between the parties. It was signed by BS Kang, but I could tell from the tone that the letter had been drafted by Eric Yoon. I responded with my own on July 16, in which I tried to be both blunt and restrained, as I knew it would be read by both of them.

Dear Mr. Kang:

We received at 10:53 p.m. on July 15 your facsimile dated that date, which, among other things, claimed that the riders provided to the FSC on the morning of July 15 do not reflect compromises agreed to with the FSC and indeed constitute steps backward. To the contrary, our proposed riders reflect not only our but also our various advisors' understanding of the business agreement that had been reached between the two sides. In fact, we are the ones who are quite surprised and disturbed to learn from our advisors and your letter that there appear to be signs of backtracking from your previous or agreed-upon positions as well as introductions of entirely new issues at this late date. We hope that this is not the case and that this merely represents a misunderstanding on our part.



Kang (or, really, Yoon) suggested that in order to resolve all the outstanding issues, we organize a marathon all-parties drafting session, and suggested holding one at the FSC office the next day, Friday, at 2 pm. This, I thought, was a terrible idea, not least because I was still in Europe. “The first priority must be to reach agreement on those terms of the transaction that remain open issues,” I wrote back to them. “In the absence of such agreement, it is pointless to try to redraft the document. We continue to be frustrated to find that even when we seem to come to terms, no understanding of that agreement is demonstrated by those on the FSC working team and its counsel who comment on documentation. In light of this, an all-hands meeting would be unproductive.” If they had any further questions or needed clarification, I reminded them that our own lawyers, Kim & Chang, were always available and willing to help. I thought it was best to leave to the lawyers on both sides to work out the specific language.

* * *

There were signs that Chairman Lee was becoming distracted by other priorities. For much of July, we had been meeting with the chairman or the FSC negotiators practically every day, including weekends. By the end of the month our contacts had become far less frequent. Chang -yuel Lim, a former finance minister who was now governor of Korea's populous Kyonggi Province, had been accused of taking bribes to help stop the government from shutting down the heavily indebted Kyonggi Bank. Chairman Lee had moved to shut the bank anyway. But Lim and Lee were former classmates, and suspicions persisted about possible collusion between them. President DJ Kim had fired two cabinet ministers in the past two months over ethics scandals, and I heard Lee was fretting that he might be next as, like Lim, he wasn't really “DJ's man.”

Adding to his woes, on July 20, the day before I flew back to Seoul, it was announced that Daewoo Group, one of KFB's biggest borrowers, was going to need an extension on 7 trillion won in short-term loans—about $7 billion. The embattled chaebol had agreed to pledge collateral to its creditor banks and restructure its motor vehicle division. The Daewoo mess was a major surprise for the Blue House, and Lee was being held responsible for not having done much to force the restructuring of this group. Confidentially, I learned, the banks were unhappy with the extension of credit. Most viewed the arrangement as a temporary stopgap measure that would do nothing about the chaebol's fundamental problems.

Amid all these distractions, Ambassador Hyun and I thought it would be useful to set up another chairman-to-chairman meeting. On July 21, I sent Bonderman a memo updating him on the situation and asking whether he would be able to come to Seoul in the next couple weeks. Bonderman, as usual, responded promptly, “Shan, if it is necessary to conclude a deal, I am sure that Dick or myself can make ourselves available in Korea for a day. However, I am absolutely unwilling to do this unless it is clear that we will sign a document while we are there.”

“This deal seems to be the only potential good news for [Lee] amidst the trouble happening around him,” I wrote to Blum and Bonderman. “But I think that we have to exert maximum pressure to push him to move.”

We decided that Blum and Bonderman should first send a letter to President DJ Kim, drafted by Tall Guy and Short Guy, and also that Bonderman should send a letter to Chairman Lee. Both letters urged the government to reengage.

There is a Chinese saying, “If the night is long, dreams are many.” It can also be applied to nightmares. The specific problems distracting Chairman Lee were unexpected, but there were bound to be problems jumping out in this troubled chapter in Korea's economic history. That was the reason we were anxious to resolve the remaining issues and sign a binding agreement. There was just no telling what would emerge to scuttle the deal. But it would take two to tango.
