title: 16 Lion's Chase

“Shan, how have you been lately? Can I invite you to a coffee to catch up?”

The familiar voice betrayed a hint of an Indian accent. It was Chandra from HSBC. The call came on September 17, 2004. I had not spoken with him for almost a year. At that time, he had approached me to express HSBC's interest in acquiring KFB, but HSBC called off the talks a couple of months later as abruptly as it had approached us. What now?

Chandra, or K. B. Chandraseka, was responsible for corporate strategy and development at HSBC. Indian by origin, he was a 26-year veteran of HSBC, which he had joined at the age of 25. He had led the negotiations for a number of the bank's strategic investments, including those in China's Bank of Communications and PingAn Insurance Group, both of which were great successes. He was experienced and shrewd, and his deals had worked out very well for his bank over the years.

Chandra did not leave me in suspense for long.

“Shan, we want to talk with you again about buying Korea First Bank. We are seriously interested.”

I needed to be sure. “I thought John Bond wasn't interested,” I told him. Sir John was chairman of HSBC. “Do you have the authorization to speak with us?”

When Chandra had reached out to me the year before, I met with him and the new CEO of HSBC in Asia, Mike Smith, to hear them out. Mike had just been transferred from HSBC Argentina. He asked, rhetorically, “Why couldn't we have done a similar deal to buy this bank back in 2000?” Smith had a strong interest in KFB. He recognized that we had done a good job turning around the bank and that it was now a very different institution from the one we first bought.

I had spent about two months discussing a deal with Smith and Chandra back in 2003. But when my partner Blum called John Bond to confirm the bank's interest, the HSBC chairman said, to our surprise, “If you want to sell KFB, we aren't a buyer.” Apparently, he had no idea that his people had approached us and that we weren't actively looking to sell. In any case, the discussions were scuttled.

This time, Chandra assured me that he was fully authorized to reach out to me, and HSBC was seriously interested in acquiring KFB. He wanted to meet to present us with a proposal.

KFB's successful turnaround had gotten noticed. Back in 1998, HSBC had been interested in buying it, but Newbridge had beaten it to the punch. Its bid for Seoul Bank had also broken down. Now that the Korean economy had recovered, its banks were tempting targets. Citibank had just acquired Korea's KorAm Bank. A few months earlier, Standard Chartered's CFO, Peter Sands, and its head of strategy and corporate development, David Stileman, had invited me to lunch to inquire about KFB, although they did not express an explicit interest in buying the bank.

By the time Chandra called me the second time, we had owned KFB for almost five years and had successfully transformed it. We would be interested in selling KFB for the right price. However, we were a patient investor and were in no hurry to sell. We knew the bank had further growth potential, but I was willing to engage with HSBC based on Chandra's assurance that, this time around, Bond had blessed their interest.

In every acquisition, valuation is always the most difficult issue. Once the parties agree to the price, the rest, even though complicated, usually can be worked out. There was, however, not much to negotiate on KFB's valuation, at least from our point of view, because Citibank's purchase of KorAm had already set a benchmark. Citi had bought KorAm at about twice its net asset or book value. Any interested buyer knew they could not buy KFB for less than that multiple of book value.

But there remained the question of how to determine the bank's book value. This might seem like an odd question because the book value of the bank was an audited figure, which KFB published annually. As a nonpublic company, normally KFB would not have to publish its annual reports. But at the request of Chairman Lee of the FSC, it had retained its status as a publicly listed company, even though there were no public shareholders and the shares were no longer traded. Since the bank had been nationalized using taxpayers' money, the FSC wanted to make sure that we maintained full transparency. We had been happy to oblige.

But the reported book value (or net asset value) is not what a buyer of a bank always accepts as the basis for valuation. Buyers generally want to know if the reported book value correctly reflects the true value of the bank's equity capital. Reported book value may not be “clean” because of inadequate provisions for bad loans, and it may include intangible assets, such as goodwill. For example, if a bank pays $100 for an asset whose net asset value is $75, the bank typically books the full purchase price of $100 as the value of the asset, although the asset's tangible value is only $75. The other $25 is recorded as goodwill, which is considered an intangible asset. A buyer may not accept goodwill or other intangible assets as having real value.

Additionally, if a bank does not correctly classify its problem loans and does not fully provision or reserve for possible loan losses and other potential impairments, the buyer may want to adjust the book value downward. A savvy buyer would want to determine the adjusted tangible book value of a bank, to see if there is a meaningful discrepancy between the reported and the adjusted book values.

Classification of a loan is often a subjective process, especially under the forward-looking methodology specified by the Bank for International Settlements. Using this methodology, a bank was supposed to classify a loan as impaired if it thought the customer might have difficulty paying off the loan in the future, even if the customer was still making payments now. By definition, “forward-looking” implied a subjective judgment. No two people would come to the same conclusion as to the amount of provision required for a particular loan—or even if a provision is required. This might present a problem, because a buyer might be more conservative than a seller. So, whose standard should the transacting parties accept? How would they resolve their differences?

That was exactly what we faced with HSBC. I made a proposal, which Chandra readily accepted, that we would jointly engage a third party from among the Big Four accounting firms to do the valuation. Whatever result was would be accepted by both sides. The Big Four include KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, and E&Y. KPMG was HSBC's own auditor and E&Y was KFB’s, so they were excluded. The remaining two were well qualified, so we didn't have any preference. We knew that KFB's loan book was clean and our management was conservative, so we did not worry about anyone questioning whether management had correctly classified loans and made appropriate provisions. We had strong confidence in KFB's reported book value.

The board of directors of KFB held four regular meetings a year, alternating the venue between somewhere in Korea and San Francisco. On September 23, 2004, we were in San Francisco for a KFB board meeting. The occasion provided the Newbridge team with a good opportunity to discuss HSBC's interest. In the end, the partners of Newbridge decided to move forward with HSBC.

Bonderman suggested engaging an investment bank to advise us on the sale. I did not think it necessary. I thought we were fully capable of managing a sale by ourselves, and it would be easier to preserve confidentiality by keeping the matter within a small, tight circle. Coincidentally, I received an email from Chandra while in San Francisco. He proposed doing the deal through a fast process, which was much to our liking.

Two weeks later, on October 6, HSBC came back with a verbal indication of $3 billion for KFB. This came as a surprise. Until this point, we had only been referring to a sale based on a multiple of book value. Based on the previous agreement, we'd assumed the parties would eventually agree to a precise multiple and precise book value, and use those to derive the purchase price. But HSBC decided simply to give us a number, without bothering to include any basis for the valuation.

When I next saw Chandra, I asked him how HSBC had come up with $3 billion. He just shrugged. I could only guess, and I suspected that HSBC wished to lock in the price in U.S. dollars because the Korean won was strengthening, raising the value of KFB's assets and book value with it.

After several weeks of discussion, HSBC still had not communicated its intentions or presented its $3 billion offer to us in writing. Presumably, it wanted to reserve maximum flexibility to make changes.

I did not terribly mind HSBC's approach, as I knew its offer was not binding anyhow. It only amounted to an indication. As such, we weren't obliged to respond, one way or the other, as to whether we felt the offer was acceptable. But we thought the indication formed a basis for further discussion and were willing to allow HSBC to proceed with due diligence on KFB.

We were concerned about any premature leak or rumors of a possible sale, which could disturb our operations, especially if the sale did not go through. Given the high profile of KFB in Korea, any rumors about it were sensitive. HSBC was similarly concerned about leaks, because at this stage a deal might or might not happen. We agreed, therefore, to bring the management team of KFB to Hong Kong, to be interviewed by the HSBC team as part of the latter's due diligence process. We would also ship most, if not all, relevant data from Seoul to Hong Kong for HSBC to review. We thought we could minimize the chances of a leak if we stayed far away from Korea, even though bringing people and data to Hong Kong was quite a costly and involved process.

HSBC requested a month of exclusivity to come to terms with us for a deal. Starting from October 6, 2004, we would deal only with HSBC and would not talk with any other parties interested in buying KFB or entertain any potential offers from any third parties. Sellers usually do not want to give exclusivity to someone before knowing that there was a high probability of a deal, because doing so would shut the door on other potential suitors. We could end up with no buyers if HSBC decided to walk. But we agreed in good faith because we thought their interest was genuine and serious.

At this point, HSBC still had not given us anything in writing, not even a letter of intent. All its indications were verbal. Nonetheless, we had, as always, every intention to honor our commitment. Prior to this date, we had received some expressions of interest from a few other parties, but we stopped talking with them after we granted HSBC exclusivity, even though that was not written down either.

The understanding between the parties was that after the due diligence process was completed, HSBC would provide us with a firm and binding offer. Of course, it also had the right to not make an offer if it did not like what it saw. We ran the risk of KFB being perceived as damaged goods if HSBC walked away after due diligence, which was one more reason for us to keep the discussion strictly confidential.

But, almost immediately, HSBC wanted to change the rules of engagement. It wanted to specify PwC as the appraiser and auditor, even though we had agreed earlier to a joint and random selection process. Nonetheless, I acquiesced. All these firms were professional, and it shouldn't make too much of a difference which one did the work, even though I knew too well that service providers tend to be biased, within a defensible range, in favor of their clients, as we had seen repeatedly in the negotiation process for acquiring KFB.

When we met the PwC team with HSBC's team on October 21, it was clear that HSBC wanted to influence PwC's work. I did not like that, but I still did not think it would make too much of a difference. We were confident in the quality of KFB's assets and its book value. So we agreed with HSBC to jointly appoint PwC as the independent auditor, even though the company was their choice.

To our great surprise, Chandra came back a few days later to say HSBC no longer felt comfortable with both parties jointly appointing the auditor and accepting the results. Rather, HSBC wanted to appoint its own auditor. I thought this was like proposing to hire your own judge in a court case or bringing your own referee to a ball game. I told him that was different from what we had agreed, but, nevertheless, if HSBC insisted, we would let them.

At this point, HSBC had indicated a price to us without regard to KFB's book value. My thinking was that if they withdrew the offer after their own due diligence, by their own auditor, there was nothing we could do about it since there was nothing binding between us. But I was confident that the quality of the bank and its assets would stand up to stringent scrutiny by the most discerning auditor. I decided to let HSBC go ahead. I thought they probably would fall more deeply in love with our bank after checking it out.

I also suspected HSBC was hoping to adjust down the indicated price after their audit. At any rate, I knew they would not volunteer to adjust the price up. I made it clear to Chandra that we would agree to HSBC engaging its own auditor but we would reserve the right not to do a deal if they came up with a book value number that deviated materially from the reported book value, say by more than 5 percent. We did not have to explicitly state that, of course; without a binding agreement, we did not have to do anything if we did not like the price. But I wanted to be up front with our counterparties and draw a line in the sand, lest they have unrealistic expectations about how far we could be pushed.

HSBC was a leading global bank. In my experience, persuading such an organization to accept a different position is often hard. Decision making at such organizations is an involved, multi-layered, and time-consuming process. Once a decision is made, changing it is difficult. Each employee, no matter how senior, has limited authority.

We tried to be understanding and reasonable, but we were not quite sure if the other side appreciated our willingness to accommodate. From the start of the process, we had met every deadline, for everything, including arriving punctually for all appointments and meetings.

The lawyers on both sides were charged with producing a draft sales and purchase agreement or the final contract for the sale. Understandably, their lawyers wanted to shift all the transaction-related risks to our side. Our counsel did not accept this, considering it not reasonable or a deviation from accepted market practice. One of the issues was severance payment for members of the management team who would be terminated by the buyer upon a change of control, as HSBC wanted to install its own management. Naturally, the buyer or the bank itself should make such payments, but HSBC initially insisted the selling shareholders should pay.

I pointed out to Chandra and others that in the month that had elapsed since they verbally indicated HSBC's offer price for KFB, the Korean won had appreciated so much that if we concluded the transaction based on the $3 billion price, HSBC would have gained more than $100 million from the appreciation of the Korean currency alone. I showed them the calculation and told them there was really no point for them to nickel-and-dime us, as these minor issues were insignificant in the context of this multi-billion-dollar transaction.

Based on our verbal agreement, if, after its month of exclusivity, HSBC wished to proceed with a transaction, it was supposed to provide us with a binding offer in writing. During the exclusivity period, we at Newbridge and the management team at KFB, led by Cohen, cooperated with the HSBC team and worked closely with them, ensuring HSBC got everything it wanted. The work was done in absolute secrecy. We took every precaution possible to keep everything under wraps.

On November 11, I received a call from Robert Cohen. “I have bad news to report,” he told me. “There is a leak. A Korean newspaper, Economic Daily, just printed a story about the sale of KFB to HSBC. All hell is breaking loose in Seoul.”

Sure enough, no sooner had Cohen hung up than my phone rang again. It was JT Kim of the KDIC, demanding to know what was going on. I gave him a full update on our talks with HSBC and explained that we had not signed anything.

Under the terms of our deal for KFB, Newbridge controlled 100 percent of the voting rights and had the right to sell 100 percent of KFB's shares including those owned by the government by exercising our drag-along right, meaning the government would be obligated to sell when we did. Of course, I intended to inform the government side if a sale was imminent. Even though we were working with HSBC, we had had enough experience to know that there was no deal until there was a deal. I offered to go to Seoul to meet JT Kim and the president of the KDIC to update them.

I also called Chandra to tell him of this development in the press. He said HSBC would always take the position of “no comment on rumors” with no denial and no confirmation, if asked by the press. I told him that would be our position as well.

KFB was probably the most written-about Korean bank by the Western media. Leading publications like the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal picked up the Economic Daily story, even without confirmation from either HSBC or Newbridge. To our relief, the international press coverage strongly endorsed the rumored deal, considering HSBC to have smartly “stolen a march on its rivals.” It soon became clear that HSBC's main rivals had noticed.

* * *

In spite of HSBC missing the deadlines and changing what we had agreed, Chandra told me, to our great comfort, that the HSBC team liked what they saw. Their review did not discover any significant problems. They thought we had negotiated a good deal with the Korean government and that KFB's management was also very good. However, HSBC had not completed its due diligence by the end of the exclusivity period (November 5), which he requested that we extend.

Furthermore, HSBC wanted a written agreement between us, by which we would accept their verbal offer, even though it would still be subject to due diligence. Basically, they wanted us to commit to selling the bank to them at the price they had indicated, but they might or might not buy it or honor the price. That was unfair, I thought, so I said no.

Now that HSBC had failed to give us a binding offer at the end of the exclusivity period, there was no telling if the bank would eventually confirm a deal with us or at what price. We ran the risk of no deal—again.

When refusing to extend the exclusivity, my calculation was that HSBC would not walk away at this point, because it had done a lot of work, was impressed with the quality of KFB, and was genuinely interested in the bank.

I made two proposals to Chandra. One was that HSBC and Newbridge would sign a mutually binding agreement, but the price could still be adjusted by a third-party adjudicator if HSBC discovered material discrepancies between the numbers we provided and HSBC's own due diligence. Alternatively, we would let them continue to do the work without exclusivity, but either party would have the right to walk away.

On Friday, November 12, the day after the news of our deal broke in the Economic Daily, Chandra called to request that I meet with him and Mike Smith, HSBC's Asia CEO. He warned me that Smith was not comfortable with the idea of an independent adjudicator. Neither would HSBC be willing to have a binding agreement prior to further due diligence. Since Newbridge was not willing to give HSBC further exclusivity, he asked me repeatedly, “Are you going to run a limited auction?”

Instead of answering his question I said, “Chandra, we would prefer to have one bird in hand, which is the certainty we have been talking about. But if this bird refuses to be in our hand, we would not shoo away all the birds in bushes.”

I did not know what HSBC wanted to do. I thought if it should decide to walk away at this point, it would mean either they never took this transaction seriously, which was unlikely, or they were too proud to concede anything, which was more likely. Given this uncertainty, and the fact that we had already gone this far down the path toward a sale, there was no turning back, and we had to keep our door open for any third-party bidders.

I met with Smith and Chandra as scheduled, on the morning of Monday, November 15, at HSBC's headquarters in Hong Kong's Central district.

The HSBC building was iconic: A broad, square tower, 44 stories tall, it looked like a futuristic factory made out of glass-and-steel LEGOs, without using any reinforced concrete in its inner core. Designed by Norman Foster, it was reputed to be the most expensive building ever built when it opened in 1985; its massive prefabricated components had to be made in the United Kingdom and shipped in. The bank sits just across a narrow lane from the Old Bank of China building, and about 220 yards (200 meters) diagonally from the 72-floor Bank of China Tower designed by I. M. Pei.

On the roof of the HSBC building are two maintenance cranes that look like big cannons pointing directly at the Bank of China Tower. Their alleged purpose, apocryphal or not, is to fend off the negative energy or whatever ill winds blow from that bank, in accordance with feng shui, a type of Chinese superstition, in my view, that connects one's fortune with one's surroundings.

I do not know if the decision makers of the British bank truly believed in their own magical powers or in those of the Bank of China, but they probably figured it was better to be safe than sorry. The nearby Citibank building is shaped like a shield, which is rumored to have the same protective effect against the potential dark energy emanating from the Bank of China. Citi obviously did not know, while HSBC apparently did, that the best defense is offense, and a cannon should be more effective than a shield. No wonder HSBC was the largest and seemingly most successful bank in Hong Kong.

I was ushered into Smith's spacious office, where he and Chandra were already waiting. After we sat down, Smith declared himself to be very disappointed and upset. He accused Newbridge of having acted in bad faith.

“My lawyers tell me that your markups on the SPA [sales and purchase agreement] are mean,” he said, “This is a fully priced deal. If you run an auction now, we will bid, but at a much lower price.”

“Mike, we have acted in good faith,” I responded. “If we have had some reservations about the tactics used by your team, we have not wished to complain. If there are differences between our markups, we should meet to work them out. But we would not characterize your side as being ‘mean.’ We considered your bank to be the most logical buyer, and we still think so. For a week we have asked for a meeting between both parties, plus lawyers, but your team refused. We met every deadline agreed on, but your team missed them all.”

Upon hearing that, he calmed down. But staring at me sternly, he asked, “Do you trust Robert?” Clearly, he suspected that KFB's CEO, Robert Cohen, had leaked the news of the deal to the press.

“I trust him absolutely,” I said. “The leak would do far greater damage to us than to you.”

The discussion shifted to the issue of tax withholding. HSBC wanted to withhold any estimated taxes Newbridge might be liable to pay on the sale, but our lawyers would not agree. “Tax is your problem,” Smith said emphatically.

I explained to him that yes, taxes were our problem. But there was no reason for HSBC to withhold taxes on our behalf. Tax authorities in Korea had never gone to the buyer for taxes owed by the seller, and because of the tax treaties between South Korea and many jurisdictions in which our investors resided, we would have to work with tax authorities to determine the liabilities. We could not allow HSBC to withhold, and pay, an arbitrary amount on our behalf.

“If you did so,” I told Smith and Chandra, “it would be unprecedented in the history of Korea.” I pointed out a few precedents, including Citibank's recent purchase of KorAm, in which there had been absolutely no issue on this point. The risk of tax authorities going after the buyer was almost nil.

“If we allow you to withhold, we would have to pay you a far greater amount than the risk of your being found liable,” I said. “The risk is hugely asymmetrical in HSBC's favor. Besides, you have already gained $120 million on currency appreciation, by my last count,” I said.

Smith knew that the potential tax liability was only a fraction of that amount. In fact, the won had appreciated more than I'd realized. HSBC's currency gain on its $3 billion offer, made about a month ago, was up to $170 million by then. And HSBC's stock price had risen 3 percent or so in the past two sessions of trading, partially due to the leaked KFB story. That added nearly $6 billion to the company's market capitalization. It was really not necessary for them to pinch pennies, in the scheme of things.

After I finished talking, I gave Smith a copy of a tax opinion issued by Kim & Chang, our Korean counsel. He mumbled something about “bloody Kim & Chang, telling us one thing and them another,” which presumably meant they had gotten some advice on some other deals from the same law firm. But he seemed to understand the issue and our position.

On due diligence, he did not know what the issue was, and began by asking if we had anything to hide. I said we were perfectly willing to let them do whatever they considered necessary within the agreed time frame. But we would like to have some objectivity in the process, as both parties had earlier agreed to use an independent auditor, so we would both be bound by the results.

“Or,” I said, “you do whatever you want for three weeks and then tell us what you wish to do, but it should not be unilaterally binding. If you make an offer, we have the right to accept it or not.”

“That is fair,” Smith said.

Then Chandra explained why they had changed their minds about using an independent third-party auditor. Earlier I had suggested that both parties should accept the results of the independent auditor and could not walk from the deal unless there was a material discrepancy between what we presented and what the auditor found. According to Chandra, HSBC's lawyers would not agree to the concept of materiality, claiming that they had never heard of such a concept before.

Materiality is a well-known concept in contracts. I thought that if HSBC's lawyers had not heard of the concept, then they were grossly incompetent and should be fired. But I held my tongue. We both knew they were using their lawyers as a scapegoat here.

Regarding next steps, Chandra said that they needed seven to 10 days more than the three additional weeks Newbridge had agreed to give them to prepare a due diligence report. I reminded him we had both agreed to another three weeks, but not more than that. Now Smith turned to Chandra: “Why can't you do due diligence in two and a half weeks and use three days to prepare a report?”

It seemed to me that Smith was relaxed about not getting further exclusivity from us. The risk to HSBC of working without exclusivity was, of course, that we would be free to entertain other potential bids. But they probably calculated that they had gotten a one-month head start on any competition and that nobody else would be able to catch up quickly enough to compete with them in another month. I was not sure there would be anyone stepping forward at this stage either.

* * *

I left for Seoul at two that afternoon, November 15, 2004. I had promised to visit the KDIC to provide it with a full download of the work we were doing with potential buyers for the bank. I wrote a memo to my partners on the flight, summarizing my meeting with Smith and Chandra.

“It seems quite clear to me that Mike Smith is rather reasonable and fair minded,” I reported, after noting he had held a biased view of how Newbridge had conducted the sale process. “Today's meeting at least allows Smith to hear our side of the story. Smith said that he would need to think about my proposal and get back to me tonight.”

I also noted in the memo that the Korean won had appreciated considerably. A month ago, the $3 billion price tag indicated by HSBC would translate into 1.92 times KFB's net asset value; but now it was only 1.82 times, or about $170 million cheaper for HSBC. I thought this might cause a problem for the KDIC because the multiple was significantly lower than that for KorAm. But, of course, we had never agreed to either the currency in which the price should be denominated or the amount of HSBC's verbal indication.

While Hong Kong was still warm, at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) in mid-November, Seoul was chilly. The morning after I arrived, November 16, the highest temperature for the day was only about 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius).

I got a call from Chandra after my morning run. He had a message from Smith. HSBC was willing to table the question of tax withholding for the time being. Assuming there were no surprises when their due diligence was completed, and the estimated tax obligation was not going to shift much from their estimates, HSBC would not let the deal fall apart over that.

HSBC also assumed that Newbridge would now want to run an auction (or a bidding process) for the bank sale, which they would be willing to participate in. Chandra agreed to send us an indication of interest in writing. It would not contain a stated offer price, but HSBC was willing to negotiate in good faith.

Chandra assured me the due diligence process would be completed in three weeks, although HSBC would need four more days to submit a binding bid. He also wanted to have the lawyers keep working simultaneously on the sale and purchase agreement, which would be submitted together with their bid.

That evening, I received HSBC's draft letter of interest.

“This in fact is the only thing in writing we have ever received from them,” I wrote to my colleagues, updating them on the development.

We had codenamed HSBC Lion in our internal communications, after the two bronze lion statues that guarded the entrance to its Hong Kong headquarters on Des Voeux Road.

“Lion wishes to sign the letter with us as soon as possible and make an announcement immediately after,” I continued. This was partly because Smith and Chandra did not think they would be able to keep the negotiations secret for long. They also wanted to be able to have conversations with the KDIC and with KFB's union, which would widen the circle of people who knew about the deal and make it virtually impossible to keep quiet. “I think we cannot do it until probably Monday next week. Meanwhile, I have asked Robert to begin to prepare for the on-site due diligence.” So far, HSBC's due diligence had been offsite, away from Korea and in Hong Kong. It would be almost impossible for us to keep things under wraps if they began due diligence on KFB premises.

* * *

The next day, November 16, I met with both the KDIC and the FSC to update them. My visit was kept secret, so as not to make Lion or anyone else nervous. Nor did I go anywhere near KFB, to avoid being seen.

I met with the KDIC's new chairman, In-Won Lee, in his office. JT Kim and another senior executive were also present. I informed them that we had at least one party interested in buying KFB and that Newbridge would shortly decide whether to run a limited auction. It would take between four to six weeks to complete. Lee said the KDIC had a slight preference for HSBC over any other potential bidders, because it was a large bank and already had an office in Korea; but it would be happy with any buyer that was a financial institution.

We discussed Newbridge's drag-along right, which gave us the right to sell the government's shares along with ours by issuing a formal notice. I proposed that we should simply have Newbridge and the KDIC sign the same sales and purchase agreement, instead of having the KDIC get dragged into the deal by a notice. I thought it would be much better optics, because being dragged might be perceived as being forced. The KDIC readily agreed.

Another encouraging piece of news was that though the sale of KDIC's stake would be subject to approval by the Public Fund Oversight Commission, of which, incidentally, the former FSC chairman Hun-jai Lee was a co-chair, the KDIC did not think the Korean government had a choice, given the binding nature of our drag-along right. The KDIC saw no apparent obstacles to the sale.

After the KDIC, I went to the FSC to meet with the officials there. The FSC team listened to my description of the situation and informed me that its approval process for a sale of this nature typically took three months. The FSC officials echoed the KDIC's comments on the sale and concurred in their opinion regarding HSBC. They said that the bar would be very high for potential bidders that were nonbank financial institutions, but any bank would be great from the government's viewpoint.

I knew that under the banking rules of Korea, a private equity firm like Newbridge would not be permitted to acquire control of a bank; we had been able to do so only because KFB was distressed during the Asian Financial Crisis. Now times had changed, and the opportunity we had had was unlikely to be repeated.

That evening, I went to Robert Cohen's home in Seoul for dinner, as invited by Robert and his wife, Annie. Their home was decorated with traditional Korean furniture and artwork, in addition to some furniture shipped over from their home in New York City. In the living room, there was a painting of a large persimmon tree, its branches loaded with bright red-orange-colored fruit. Persimmon was a popular fruit in Korea and it was in season. I thought the painting captured what we were going through at the moment. Our effort had borne fruit; KFB had been transformed into a sound and healthy bank. Now it was harvest-time, and it looked like we would have a bumper crop.

I immensely enjoyed the exquisite French cuisine that Annie cooked in a setting that blended Korean and Western cultures. The dinner had a celebratory air even though no deal had officially been agreed. Cohen was happy that things seemed to be moving in the right direction. We had all worried about what impact the press leak might have had on the process. Happily for us all, the episode seemed to have blown over. I was sure it was not lost on the Cohens that if we completed the sale, they would have accomplished their mission and would soon be going home in New York.

Newbridge's offices were located in Hong Kong's International Financial Center, a massive complex right next to Victoria Harbour. We had moved from our old office on Queen's Road Central into One IFC, an ultra-modern, 37-story tower shortly after it opened in 1999 at the tail end of the Asian Financial Crisis. Four years later we moved again, to Two IFC, an 88-story tower that at the time was the tallest building in Hong Kong. My 57th-floor window looked out over the harbor, bustling with boat and ship traffic, and at the high-rises of Kowloon across the water.

On Monday, November 22, 2004, I spent 10 minutes walking from our office at Two IFC to the HSBC building. Many buildings in Central were connected by a network of walkways and passageways, over roads and through buildings, which allowed people to get from one part of the district to another without getting wet, even in one of Hong Kong's legendary typhoons.

Arriving at HSBC, I went again to Smith's office. This time, he was in a good mood. At about noon, he and I signed HSBC's “letter of expression of interest” in his office. The signing was more symbolic than substantive because there was no mention of price, but it did represent the bank's expression of serious interest in acquiring KFB, with the exact terms remaining to be negotiated and agreed upon by the parties.

After the signing, we chatted for a while. I mentioned that I had heard a story about him being chased by gunmen during his time as HSBC's head in Argentina. It was indeed a true story, he told me. He had exposed a kickback scheme, and those involved had chased and shot at him in his car in an act of retribution. Smith opened his drawer and pulled out some photographs of the damaged car, riddled with bullet holes and stained with blood on his seat. He had been shot in the thigh.

I thought this was quite horrible and that he was lucky to be alive. I had never thought of banking as a life-threatening occupation. Smith was animated and cheerful when he told me the story, as if he were describing an exciting James Bond movie. Only the bloodstained upholstery of the car in the photo reminded me of how close he had come to being killed.
