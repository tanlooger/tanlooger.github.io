title: Appendix：A Primer on Commercial Banking
---






To follow the story of this book, it is useful to be familiar with the basics of commercial banking, or how banks operate. This primer covers the major concepts and terminology of commercial banking. A reader can flip back to this primer as a reference for some key banking concepts and terminologies discussed in the book. For the convenience of the reader, I use italics to highlight the key terms below.

By banks mentioned in this primer and elsewhere in the book, I am generally referring to commercial banks, whose business is mainly to collect deposits and make loans. Investment banks are a different type; they generally function, for a fee, as intermediaries between sources and uses of capital, such as when they arrange for a company to sell its stocks or bonds in the public market.

Some banks do both investment and commercial banking; others specialize in one or the other. In the United States, banks used to be able to do both, but they were required to choose one or the other by the Glass-Steagall Act, a law passed in 1933 in the wake of the Great Depression during which thousands of banks had failed. The act prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment banking business. For example, the old and venerated JP Morgan, also known as the House of Morgan, was separated into JP Morgan, which became a commercial bank, and Morgan Stanley, which operated as an investment bank. By the time I went to work for JP Morgan in 1993, these laws had been significantly loosened.

The Glass-Steagall Act was largely repealed by 1999, allowing large American banks such as JP Morgan and Citibank to engage in both commercial and investment banking businesses, although traditional investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, still focus mostly on investment banking. Those that do both commercial and investment banking are often referred to as universal banks. In Europe, banks have always been allowed to operate as universal banks, although large institutions, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, are predominantly commercial banks.

A commercial bank receives funding by collecting deposits from customers and by borrowing from the market or from other banks. It has money of its own, which is its equity capital, or the money invested in the bank by its shareholders. Some liabilities do not bear interest. Those that do, such as deposits, bonds issued by the bank, or borrowings from other banks, are called interest-bearing liabilities.

The average costs a bank pays for the funds it receives are referred to as its funding costs, which are usually expressed in percentage terms to compare with the average interest rate of its loans. For example, we can say that a bank's funding cost is 3 percent.

The bank's assets include loans made by the bank to its customers, securities it has invested in, and any properties it owns, such as its headquarters or branch offices. The bank generates income by charging interest on the loans it makes, receiving fees for services it provides, collecting coupons from the bonds it has bought, and so on. Some assets, such as a branch building or a computer system, do not generate an income in and of themselves. Those assets that do produce an income are referred to as earning assets. A stream of income from an asset, such as the interest on a loan, is also referred to as the yield. And those earning assets that earn a yield are also known as yielding assets.

A bank makes money mostly from the spread, which is the difference in interest rates between its lending and its borrowing. For example, a bank may pay 3 percent interest for deposits and charge 5 percent for a loan. The 2 percent difference is the spread, which compensates the bank for the risk it takes by lending money: The bank is obligated to pay back all of its deposits, regardless of whether it is able to collect on all its loans.

A bank incurs operating costs by paying its staff, rent, and utility bills. A bank can make money only if its operating income, consisting mostly of interest income and fees minus interest expenses, is greater than its operating costs. The ratio between operating costs and operating income is known as the cost/income ratio, which needs to be less than 1 (i.e., costs need to be less than income in order for the bank to earn a profit). If the cost/income ratio is greater than 1, the bank loses money as its operating income does not cover its operating costs.

A bank's net profit divided by its equity capital is its return on equity, or ROE. The net profit of a bank divided by its total assets is its return on assets, or ROA. Both ROE and ROA are important measures of a bank's profitability.

A bank cannot make money from a loan if it fails to collect the interest and principal of the loan. If a borrower makes regular interest and principal payments, the loan is considered a performing loan. If a customer stops making payments, the loan becomes a nonperforming loan or NPL. Such a loan is also called a bad loan.

A bank classifies its loans on its own books into various categories depending on how confident the bank is that it will be able to recoup its money. These categories have names such as normal, special mention (or precautionary, or questionable), substandard, doubtful, or loss. A performing loan is not always classified as normal; a bank may change a loan's classification if it determines that the borrower's ability to repay is impaired (i.e., that there is a risk that the borrower may not be able to pay back all the interest and the principal). In general, banks consider loans classified as substandard or below as impaired. Impaired loans are also called classified loans or, more colloquially, bad loans.

Normally, a bank lends only to a customer whom it judges to be creditworthy or to have the ability to pay back the loan, including its interest and principal, by each of the due dates and by the loan's maturity, which is the final date for repayment. There is, of course, always a risk that a loan cannot be recovered, such as when a corporate customer goes bankrupt or when the bank simply misjudges the credit of the borrower. To compensate for such risks or potential losses, the bank typically charges a higher interest rate for riskier customers. Charging different interest rates in accordance with the risk profile of the customer is known as risk pricing.

The interest rate that the bank charges its best, or prime, corporate customers is referred to as the prime rate. The difference between the interest charged to a customer and the prime rate is the risk premium.

Since there is always a risk that some loans will go bad, the bank needs to set aside some money to offset such potential losses. The money put aside is referred to as provisions or reserves. Larger provisions or reserves are required for riskier loans. For example, the provisioning for a loan classified as substandard may be 20 percent of its principal amount, whereas for a doubtful loan, the provisioning can be 50 percent or more. A loan's remaining unpaid principal amount is referred to as its book value, since it refers to how the loan is recorded on the accounting books of the bank. The actual value of a loan may be less than its book value if it is impaired.

The total amount of nonperforming loans divided by the total loan portfolio of the bank is known as the bank's nonperforming loan ratio, or NPL ratio.

A bank has an obligation to pay back its depositors, no matter if it makes or loses money. Therefore, it must have adequate equity capital in case its assets are not sufficient to cover its borrowings, such as when its NPL ratio is too high or too many of its assets are impaired or written off. The bank's capital as a percentage of its risk-weighted total assets is called its capital ratio or capital adequacy ratio. There is an international norm for what capital ratio is considered adequate or required for a bank; this capital adequacy requirement is set by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. Therefore, the capital adequacy ratio is also referred to as the BIS ratio.

The bank's equity capital is also referred to as its net asset value (NAV) or book value. The reported book value or reported NAV may or may not reflect how much equity the bank actually has, because the book value may include intangibles. If a bank buys an asset and pays a price higher than the net asset value, then the difference is recorded on the bank's book as goodwill, which is an intangible asset. The book value without intangibles is the tangible book value or the tangible net asset value.

Sometimes a bank under-provisions against its bad loans. In such a case, if the bank is fully provisioned for potential losses, the bank's book value will need to be adjusted down. A buyer of a bank typically wants to make its own determination as to whether there is under-provision, and, if so, the buyer would want to adjust its book value. This new book value becomes the adjusted book value. In fact, a buyer also tends to look only at the tangible book value, which, once adjusted, becomes adjusted tangible book value, which is the most conservative assessment of the bank's real net asset value.

When a bank's NPL ratio is higher than its capital ratio, it is in danger of going bankrupt: It does not have enough money to pay back all its liabilities. In a financial crisis, when many companies cannot repay their loans, the NPL ratio can shoot up suddenly, causing the bank to fail. This is what was happening to many banks in South Korea during the 1997–1998 Asian Financial Crisis and in America and Europe during the 2008–2009 Global Economic Crisis.

A bank can fail even if it has enough capital but it does not have enough liquidity, or cash on hand, to meet demand—such as when customers need to withdraw unexpected amounts of cash, or when the bank needs to pay back its own borrowings. When a large number of depositors rush to withdraw their deposits in a panic because they are worried that the bank may fail, the phenomenon is called a bank run. A bank run can drain a bank's available cash, causing it to fail.

In most developed countries, there is a national deposit insurance system to prevent such bank runs: Deposits up to a certain limit are insured by a government-owned insurance company so that even if a bank fails, retail depositors can still get their money back, up to a certain limit, from the government-owned deposit insurance company. Examples include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC) in Korea. If the deposit insurance company does not have enough funds to pay back the depositors, the government will often use taxpayers' money to make the depositors whole or to bail out the bank, as the government of South Korea did in 1998–1999 and as the U.S. government did in 2008–2009.
