title: 15 Change Agent
---






A change of CEO always brings a huge amount of uncertainty to an organization. We needed someone with experience and a reputation for integrity, whom the board could immediately trust, and who was willing to relocate to Seoul. Importantly, it would have to be someone who could win the respect of our partner, the Korean government, and of KFB's employees. No matter how much experience a new leader arrives with, it remains a question whether he or she will be effective in a new environment, new culture, and new market. KFB, especially, was shifting course and implementing big internal changes, so the new CEO had to be a change agent and turnaround specialist. The task of finding the right person was urgent and daunting.

Immediately after the board meeting on September 13, we began our search. I was talking with Paul Chen that evening after dinner at the Shilla Hotel. “We have to find someone who is an experienced banker with proven leadership quality, who can be trusted by the board, and who is willing to take the job. That is very tough,” I said.

After a pause, Chen turned to me and said, “How about Robert Cohen?”

It was a classic cartoon moment: I felt like a light switch in my head turned on and my eyes lit up. “Paul, that is a good idea,” I said. “Why, it's a perfect idea!”

We all knew Cohen well by now. Robert (pronounced Rho-BEHR) Cohen had been invited to join the KFB board by Bonderman, who had known him for a long time. Medium height and bespectacled, Cohen wore a beard and an easy smile. He came with impeccable credentials as a veteran banking leader. He had been vice chairman of the Republic National Bank of New York before he retired. Before that he had been CEO of Crédit Lyonnais USA, with responsibility for the whole of the Americas. Cohen was also a scholar. With a PhD in finance from the Université Paris Dauphine, he had taught economics and finance in elite French schools for 16 years. With this rare combination of an academic background and a practitioner's experience, Robert Cohen not only knew banking inside and out, he also had experience running a large banking operation in a culture different from his own.

Cohen seemed the most suitable candidate for the CEO position, especially at that particular moment in time. Thinking over his participation on the board, we all saw him as one of our most diligent members. He invariably put in the hours to read every page of the meeting materials. He seemed to know every subject and every number by heart. He had made contributions to board discussions since the day he joined. His comments and suggestions were considered and thought provoking; he often offered new ideas and perspectives. For example, from early on, he advocated for lengthening the duration of KFB's assets, in anticipation of falling interest rates. (A fall in interest rates will increase the value of longer-dated interest-bearing assets more than shorter-dated ones). He would prove to be completely correct. The bank would have been more profitable if the management followed his advice on the asset mix.

We also knew that Cohen and his wife had taken a strong interest in Korean culture since they first visited for our board meeting. (See Exhibits 14, 15, and 16.) However, Korea at the time was generally not a popular posting for Western businesspeople, and the expatriate community in Seoul was relatively small. It was difficult to get around speaking English (and even harder speaking French, Cohen's mother tongue). The working language of KFB was predominantly Korean, which Cohen did not speak. We had no idea if he would be interested in the challenges of such a difficult job or in moving his family to Seoul.

I called Cohen in his room and invited him out for a walk in the hills behind the Shilla Hotel.

“We have a problem …,” I began.

I was about to get into my prepared speech about the challenges we faced, searching for a new CEO, to start as soon as possible, whose credentials would pass muster with multiple constituencies, including the board, the Korean government, employees, customers, and, of course, the media. But before I could continue, Cohen interrupted me: “Do you think I am the solution to your problem?” “Why, yes. Of course, that is if you are interested to consider it.” I said.

“I am interested but I need to talk with my wife.” Cohen said.

I needed to speak with my partners and with Barnum, chairman of the board. I was confident that all would be delighted if Cohen was willing to take the job.

They were. Bonderman, Blum, and Carroll all thought Cohen was a great choice, and they were pleasantly surprised to hear that, after speaking with his wife, Cohen had agreed to do it.

The biggest question we were now facing was: How would a French CEO fare in a Korean organization?

“Well,” Blum said, “at least they have something in common. They don't speak each other's languages, but they all speak English as a foreign language.”

Our confidence in Cohen aside, what he took on was indeed a great challenge, as he would soon discover.

We announced the appointment of Cohen as president and CEO of Korea First Bank on October 23, 2001, effective immediately. The transition was smooth. The departing CEO and the incoming CEO held a joint press conference. The change surprised the market, but Cohen was quickly accepted by the employees and the banking community in Seoul as an experienced banker and leader.

* * *

As the new CEO, Cohen had to quickly set his strategy, develop his long-term plan, and establish his own team. Soon after he took office, he announced his three-year targets, which would aim to carry the bank from 2002 to 2004. These were simple but ambitious. He wanted to grow the total assets of the bank from about 25 trillion won to 40 trillion won. Of the 25 trillion won in total assets at the end of 2001, client assets, such as loans to customers, were only 11 trillion won. The rest, including government notes and real estate, were not as profitable. Because of the need to shed its nonperforming loans in the wake of the financial crisis, KFB had lost a large number of clients. Cohen's predecessor's reorientation toward retail banking resulted in the further loss of corporate clients. Cohen wanted to more than double client assets, from 11 trillion won to 25 trillion won, in three years. That was an ambitious goal, and it was initially met with strong skepticism by the bank's employees.

As one of his first orders of business, Cohen followed through on his idea to increase the amount of longer-dated interest-bearing assets, in anticipation of further drops in interest rates. The bank began to acquire long-term, fixed-interest-rate assets as soon as he became CEO. By then, the interest rate was already falling. He was able to acquire a few trillion won's worth of long-term, fixed-interest-rate assets, but the bank would have made more money if it had followed his advice much sooner.

He also found the accounting system that was prevalent in South Korea at that time to be woefully inadequate. For example, accounting was done on a cash basis, rather than the accrual basis that was standard in the West. Under the cash basis method, if the bank borrowed money at a 6 percent interest rate to be paid at the end of the year, no interest expenses were recorded by the bank until the money was actually paid. If accounting was done on an accrual basis, the bank would have recorded half of the interest accrued by the middle of the year even though the payment would not be made until the end of the year. Similarly, if the bank made a loan with a similar interest-payment structure, it would not record interest income until cash was received, whereas accounting on an accrual basis would allow some of the anticipated income from the loan to be booked before cash was received.

Needless to say, cash accounting did not give the management an adequate picture of the actual financial performance of the bank. Cohen worked with Ranvir Dewan, the former Citibanker and KFB's CFO, to quickly rectify these problems.

Cohen was a great communicator, despite his strongly accented English—and no Korean. For example, he pronounced “Seoul” as “sei woo,” with an emphasis on “woo.” He had to talk with his Korean executives and employees through an interpreter. He was undaunted, however, as he thought that getting his message across to all employees was critically important and that if the employees bought into his strategic targets, they would be able to help him achieve them. His method was to make his targets simple to understand—40 trillion won in total assets and 25 trillion in client assets in three years—and to explain it in meeting after meeting with both executives and employees, for hundreds of hours, until everyone was on board with his objectives.

The fact that he was a very experienced banker and could logically explain why his goals were achievable and could relate to his own experiences elsewhere allowed him to speak with clarity, authority, and credibility. He did more than convince his staff; he excited them. Every banker knew that the prestige of a bank and the respect its employees receive were often tied to the size of the bank, measured by its total assets. The employees were excited that, with this plan, they were restoring KFB to its former glory of being, once again, first in Korea.

To achieve these targets, Cohen had to change the mix of corporate and retail banking yet again. In 2000 and 2001, KFB had gradually moved away from corporate banking in favor of building retail assets. However, growing retail loans would take a long time because each retail loan, by definition, was small. It would be faster to build assets by growing corporate loans, which were typically much larger but, of course, riskier. Cohen's strategy was to reengage with corporate customers while continuing to grow the retail business.

As he was formulating his targets, Cohen also reorganized the management team. He did it in a way completely foreign to Korea, where a system of hierarchy by seniority was strictly observed. Unlike in the West, there was neither a performance evaluation system nor even personnel records of performance evaluations by superiors or peers. Cohen wanted the most capable, not necessarily the most senior, executives in key positions. He personally interviewed 50 candidates for one and a half hours each over a six-week period to find a new head of retail banking. He chose Seung-yeol Yang, who did not speak English (or French) yet commanded respect among the rank and file.

The biggest challenge in aggressively growing client assets for a bank was risk control, especially for loans made to corporate customers. Without a sound risk control system, loans made to customers with weak credit could become bad loans, as KFB painfully had experienced before its failure. How to rapidly grow client assets without taking too much risk was literally a science. In this regard, KFB under Cohen's leadership did something that no other Korean bank was doing.

Under a program dubbed Pro-Branch, KFB's entire network of more than 400 branches was completely restructured and reorganized. The concept was recommended by Bain & Company, which we engaged to help us with strategic analysis and recommendations, and was adopted by Cohen after the board had approved it. Pro-Branch was going to require a lot of capital investment, as the branches would be revamped and renovated, but the board concurred with Cohen that the investment was essential for the long-term growth of the bank.

In Korea, as in much of Asia at that time, the manager of a bank branch had a great deal of power, as he was the decision maker for approving or denying loans. But putting all that power in the hands of the branch manager created two problems. The first was that credit decisions were not based on a single set of criteria but on the personal judgment of an individual. Consequently, loan quality varied from branch to branch. The second problem was that it would be difficult for a branch manager to turn down a loan request from an acquaintance, especially if the acquaintance was senior to the manager in age, as Korean culture obliged younger people to be deferential to older people.

The Pro-Branch Program took corporate banking away from most of the branches and concentrated the corporate lending business at KFB headquarters and some major regional corporate banking centers. Branch managers and their bankers would be responsible for generating loan applications but not for making credit decisions or approving loans. Whether the loan would be approved or not was a decision made at headquarters. For corporate loans generated in certain large branches, the decision to lend would be made by the credit committee, headed by our chief credit officer, SH Lee. With the Hynix debacle behind him, Lee turned out to be a great gatekeeper.

For retail loans, the decision-making power was also taken away from branches and moved to the newly formed Decision Science Department, headed by Keith Shachat, an American whose prior experience included working at American Express and Associates First Capital, both leaders in consumer finance. His department was responsible for retail risk analysis and control as a basis to underwrite, meaning approve or reject, retail loans.

This department was called Decision Science because the team used sophisticated statistical tools, algorithms based on probability theory, and a large amount of historical data to score loan applicants based on the individual data they provided. The scores indicated the probability the applicant would be able to pay back a loan. Those whose scores were above a certain cut-off point would be approved, and those below would be rejected. The analytics were fully computerized. An operator only needed to know what personalized data went in and what results came out, without any knowledge of how the computation was done. The technologies and data were fine-tuned on an ongoing basis to make sure the calculated probabilities approximated reality as closely as possible. It was all so complex that we sometimes called it the Rocket Science Department. Today it would be called artificial intelligence.

Shachat and his family had to relocate from the United States to Seoul for the job, but there was one complication. He was attached to his dog, and for some reason—maybe because of its size, or maybe because they could not bear to be separated from each other during a long flight—he could not get any commercial airline to take the dog to Korea. But Shachat was firm that he would not come to Seoul without his dog. The next thing I knew, Bonderman flew to Seoul for a board meeting in his private jet with a guest passenger who was critically important for the future of KFB's growth: Shachat's dog. Not only were we able to get Shachat on board, we now knew we could keep him in his job in Seoul indefinitely, as there was no easy way to get his dog out.

Shachat built his department into a powerhouse, with more than 40 young decision scientists and technicians. The department created its own credit bureau, which housed data on the credit records of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of consumers, pulled from different sources. Its capabilities allowed KFB to offer mortgage loans, secured against the properties of the borrowers, as well as unsecured consumer loans without taking undue risks.

The centralized and computerized decision-making process worked seamlessly. The branch banker would input the loan applicant's personal data into his or her computer with the customer sitting across the desk, and, within one minute, the results from headquarters would be returned. The banker would be able to tell the customer if the loan was approved, at what amount, and at what interest rate. To the customer, it looked like the branch officer was making the decision in real time. Most had no idea that it was actually being made in a black box developed by our rocket scientists. After the credit was approved, KFB was able to process a fully documented loan within three days—an efficiency that was previously unheard of in Korean banking.

The centralized loan approval process was efficient and accurate. It freed up branch bankers to increase production volume. KFB's management pushed out new products, such as 30-year mortgages with a few years of fixed interest followed by adjustable rates, similar to those found in the U.S. market. The Korean mortgage market had previously been limited to three-year loans with adjustable interest rates. The combination of rapid approval time, strong sales by the branches, and new products helped catapult KFB's market share in mortgages from less than 1 percent at the end of 2001 to 9 percent by 2003 and 11 percent by 2004. Even with this rapid growth, KFB's loan quality remained excellent, and its credit loss ratio was practically nil.

On the corporate loan side, the credit committee, led by SH Lee, was similarly impressive, growing the loan book while maintaining the best loan quality in Korea's entire banking system. KFB's nonperforming loan ratio, or the percentage of bad loans to total loans on its books, hovered around 1 percent—far below the 2 to 3 percent ratio experienced by other Korean banks.

Cohen was able to build a strong relationship with employees and their morale was high, but he had inherited a difficult situation with the labor union. The previous CEO had wanted to outsource KFB's IT services, because the old system was antiquated and had suffered years of neglect following KFB's failure and nationalization. While the board approved the decision, management had failed to discuss it with the union, even though shutting down the internal IT department meant loss of jobs. The decision was met with such strong resistance from the union that KFB's loan production nearly came to a halt.

Cohen's predecessor had eventually capitulated to the union's pressure. He agreed to cancel the outsourcing and also agreed to a three-year salary increase for all employees benchmarked against the largest Korean bank, Kookmin, even though KFB's productivity, measured by the dollar value of assets per employee, was less than half of the industry average at that time.

Cohen's strategy was to be completely transparent with his employees and with the union. He openly broadcast his plans, repeatedly and to everyone. There was no hidden agenda. A major challenge for the bank was overcapacity. Over the course of its failure and nationalization during the economic crisis, KFB was reduced to a shadow of its former self in terms of the size of its total assets, but the size of its workforce had not decreased correspondingly. KFB really needed only about half its existing staff, given its reduced asset size.

This redundancy was compounded by the Pro-Branch Program, which eliminated loan decision making at the branches. If KFB reduced its staff over an extended period of time, it would have two major unwanted side effects. It would create a big morale issue, as staff would be worried about job security and nobody would know when the next wave of layoffs would hit. And it would cost the bank, on average, about three years' salary to retire an employee, which was an expensive proposition.

The CEO's decision, which was approved by the board, was to go through with a limited payroll reduction, achieved over a limited period of time with generous early retirement packages. And it was clearly communicated to all employees that there would be no more staff reduction after this one-time cut. How would we address the issue of staff redundancy? Cohen's plan was that instead of cutting the oversized clothes to fit the body, he would grow the body into the clothes. Until there was a better fit between the size of the bank's total assets and its infrastructure, defined to a large extent by the number of the staff, there would be redundancy and inefficiency. Measured in terms of assets per employee, KFB would lag behind other banks on employee productivity. But it would have an abundant workforce to produce loans and rapidly grow its asset base to meet Cohen's objectives.

Cohen's strategy of growing assets to fit the infrastructure, as opposed to cutting payroll to fit the asset size, resulted in rapid asset growth, as expected, but profitability still lagged because of high staff costs. At the board level, we fretted about the slow growth in profitability and debated whether further staff reduction was a more advisable strategy. Some of our peers also noticed our bank was overstaffed. Seung-Yu Kim, CEO of Hana Bank, another major bank in South Korea, approached me and suggested that we consider merging the two banks, provided KFB cut its payroll by 1,000 people first. We did not accept his proposal, but as owners we worried about the issue. We eventually supported Cohen's strategy because his rationale was compelling. We were also happy we were able to keep so many jobs.

Cohen developed a respectable working relationship with KFB's labor union, although it got off to a rocky start. Soon after he became CEO, the union staged a showdown with him, probably for the purpose of warning him not to repeat the mistake of his predecessor, who decided to outsource IT services without consulting with the union first. As Cohen recalled in his memoir, Turning Around a Bank in Korea, “I fully expected this test, but it was brutal. The union asked management to step back on a minor decision (I even forgot what it was). I refused, and the big demonstration began.” About 50 union members loudly and noisily demonstrated outside of his office on the executive floor, beating drums, shouting slogans, and blocking his exit until late at night.

At the first board meeting after Cohen's appointment, the demonstrating union members positioned themselves directly outside the boardroom. They wore black shirts and red headbands with slogans written in white. The slogans were written in Korean, so we had no idea what they said, but maybe that was for the best. They sat cross-legged, chanting and beating large Korean folk drums, which were incredibly loud. They raised their fists when they shouted slogans, which punctuated their chants. The directors walking into the meeting room were more amused than intimidated, as the demonstration, although noisy, was peaceful and presented an unusual sight. If the union members had not been punching air with their fists, the board members probably would have wanted their pictures taken with them.

Blum walked over to one of the protesters, shook his hand, and then gave him a bear hug. This happened in silence as neither spoke the other's language. Blum was about twice the age of the man he held in his arms and one full head taller. Blum hugged him so tightly and for so long it was as if he were holding a long-lost son. Everyone applauded. Another union member stepped forward and put a headband on Blum's head, which I suppose made him an honorary member of the union.

Cohen was eventually able to resolve his differences with the union and over time won members' trust and support. For the next few years, the management had a good and respectful relationship with the union and held a number of events at the suggestion of the union leaders, including the celebration of the 74th and 75th anniversaries of KFB's founding. The harmonious relationship helped boost employee morale and instilled a sense of common purpose in everyone's mind.

My view is that there is nothing that cannot be worked out if management treats the union and its employees with respect and with an open mind. Ultimately, employees are generally reasonable and unions are generally responsible. Everyone at KFB wants the bank to be a source of pride. About a decade after we'd sold KFB to a new owner, the company experienced the longest and most crippling labor strike in the history of Korean banking. Not surprisingly, financial performance deteriorated sharply. I found it hard to understand what differences between the bank's management and its employees could be so irreconcilable as to justify putting the whole business at risk.

By the end of 2002, Cohen's first full year at the helm, all the major international rating agencies, including Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, had raised KFB's credit rating from junk to investment grade. Total assets grew from less than 27 trillion won at the end of 2001 to more than 32 trillion won—a 19 percent increase in one year—exceeding the original budget by 30 percent.

Cohen was determined that the bank required more capital to fund its growth. He proposed that it raise capital by issuing what was known as tier-one hybrid subordinated debt. This debt was subordinated to, or ranked below, all the other debt of the bank. In the event the bank went bust, holders of this debt would get paid last, making the debt more like equity capital. The hybrid label indicated that it was a cross between debt and equity. As such, regulators treated it as tier-one capital for the purpose of calculating the bank's capital adequacy ratio. International investors eagerly snapped up the hybrids, allowing KFB to quickly raise the additional capital to support its growth. It was a resounding endorsement by investors of KFB's success and prospects.

By 2002, South Korea was experiencing a boom in consumer credit. As mentioned, at the beginning of 2000, the country was largely a cash society, with limited credit card use. The government decided to promote the use of credit cards for two purposes. One was to increase private consumption to propel economic growth. The other was to prevent abuse and fraud relating to business expenses; credit card receipts were harder to falsify than cash transactions were. The government provided incentives like tax rebates for purchases using credit cards instead of cash. Not surprisingly, this triggered a boom in the issuance of credit cards. Some card issuers were bank subsidiaries, such as the credit card subsidiary of Korea Exchange Bank. Others were independent credit card companies affiliated with large chaebols, such as LG Card and Samsung Card.

At the peak of the credit card boom, card companies were literally giving out cards on the streets to anyone who cared to take one, without any meaningful credit approval process. In 2002, the total number of credit cards issued in South Korea reached 105 million. This was in a country with a population of 38 million people over the age of 14. On average, every adult in Korea had three cards. In urban centers like Seoul, the average was closer to four or five.

Why did people need so many cards? Credit cards were used not only for purchases but also for cash advances, which represented more than 60 percent of card billings in 2002. Credit card issuers allowed cardholders to pay off their credit card debt with other credit cards. Consumers were playing a Ponzi scheme against themselves, continuously obtaining and borrowing from a new card to pay back another. If one card issuer could not lend any more, the whole scheme would collapse, which was exactly what happened in 2003. The market was jolted by the news that LG Card, the largest credit card company in South Korea, was on the verge of bankruptcy, causing a credit card crisis.

KFB had been looking for ways to grow its assets and was a large provider of bulk lending, or large-size loans, to credit card companies. These loans were secured by the card receivables or obligations of cardholders to pay. In 2002, KFB's total lending to credit card companies amounted to about 5 trillion won, or about five times the bank's total equity capital. Cohen and his management team were concerned about the risks of the bank's exposure to credit card companies and began a program to cut it drastically. By the time the credit card crisis hit, KFB was completely out of the bulk lending business with, surprisingly, zero exposure to credit card companies. If management had not moved quickly and wisely, KFB would have failed again, many times over, in 2003. Under Cohen and his team, KFB not only dodged a huge bullet but stood out as the only bank without any exposure to credit card companies. Sixteen other banks were deeply mired in the LG Card fiasco alone.

Was KFB simply lucky to have gotten out just before the crisis hit? No. I would argue that management’s awareness of peripheral risks had improved considerably. In May 2003, SK Global, the trading company subsidiary of SK Group, the third largest chaebol in South Korea, went into receivership. KFB was the lead bank for SK Group. But the management, led by Cohen, had grown increasingly jittery about SK Global and had begun to aggressively cut the bank's exposure to the subsidiary. SK Group threatened to terminate its relationship with KFB. Losing such a major account would be a big deal for any bank, but our management decided that SK Global had become too much of a risk. KFB did lose the SK Group account, but when SK Global flopped, KFB was unscathed, whereas many other banks got into trouble.

Many people think that private equity investors buy a business on the cheap, dress it up, and sell it for a higher price. That certainly was not and is not what we do. Sometimes we get lucky with the timing and market conditions. More often, success requires judgment, difficult decisions, and a lot of hard work. We create value by turning around troubled businesses and by improving their operations. It involves much pain, sacrifice, investment, and strategic trade-offs. Unlike public companies, we do not have to worry about profitability from quarter to quarter, and we can focus on improving the long-term value of an institution. Our ability to take the long-term view allows us to make strategic and fundamental changes and to build and grow the businesses we acquire. Cohen testified to this in his memoir. “I do not believe in a quick paint job on a crumbling building. Cosmetic changes just do not work,” he wrote. “We totally rebuilt the bank from the foundation up like we thought it should have been, without shortcuts.” Then he said, “I remember vividly a discussion at the board of directors on a large investment commitment and David Bonderman, the senior partner of TPG, saying, ‘If it is needed for the long-term good of the bank, we must do it.’”

The successful turnaround of KFB was certainly not an accident. It represented private equity at its best. In a few years, we had transformed a once-failed, wobbly bank into the healthiest institution in Korea. And on this strong foundation it was growing rapidly, shattering industry records year after year.

By 2004, KFB had achieved the number one position in many categories. It was the best-capitalized bank in the country and had the lowest nonperforming loan ratio by far. It had the lowest credit card delinquency ratio. Its client assets (i.e., loans made to clients) per employee had tripled in three years, whereas no other bank came close to doubling. Cohen's initial plan was to reach 33.5 trillion won in total assets by the end of 2004. In fact, KFB achieved 43.5 trillion won in total assets, with almost all the increase coming from client assets, which had tripled in three years. KFB was fundamentally transformed. It was a sound, strong bank with the best governance structure, best risk management, and the best asset quality in the market. It truly became the first in Korea.

I recalled a Wall Street Journal editorial from January of 1999, when Newbridge was still struggling through negotiations with the FSC: “To those wailing about Seoul giving away the ‘crown jewels’ here: Listen, Korea First Bank ain't no jewel. But now it has a chance to become one.”

Through so much effort and over so many years, we had seized that chance and achieved what we had set out to do. Korea First Bank had once again become the shining crown jewel of Korea.
