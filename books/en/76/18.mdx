The sale on Christmas Eve brought the story of KFB to a happy ending, but it brought little respite to my worries on that day. In fact, the sale of KFB was far from the only project that had kept me busy. We had been working on another major bank deal, with an even higher profile—this time in China, where no private investor, domestic or foreign, had ever controlled a nationwide commercial bank, as we were about to do.

I had received a phone call the previous day, December 23, from Liu Mingkang (Liu being his family name), chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, or CBRC. The subject was Shenzhen Development Bank (SDB), a nationwide commercial bank in China. We had been fighting for the control of this bank for the past 30 months, but we were scheduled to close the deal in about a week.

Liu told me, “We noted the problems you have identified for Shenzhen Development Bank and we have sent a report of these problems to the State Council.” The State Council is China's cabinet, headed by the prime minister. The bank's problems were severe enough to warrant attention at the highest levels of government. Then he said, switching to English from Chinese, “Tell your partners that in case of any emergency, like a bank run, the PBOC and CBRC will be on standby, to provide liquidity support.”

The PBOC, or the People's Bank of China, is the country's central bank. Liu spoke in English to make sure I would convey his exact message to my American partners. He was trying to give us confidence that China's central bank and the banking regulator would not let SDB fail.

The call was extraordinary. Chairman Liu would not have said this about SDB had he not thought such a risk was real. In 2004, the bank's reported bad loan ratio was 11.4 percent, although the true number, our analysis indicated, was probably about double what was reported. Its capital adequacy ratio stood at 2.3 percent, way below the regulatory minimum of 8 percent. The real capital ratio would have been negative if all the bad loans had been properly provisioned. Technically, the bank was insolvent. If the public became aware of just how weak it was, a run on SDB was not impossible.

But we were planning to take over control of that technically insolvent bank before year-end. Now that we had turned the page on KFB, we had to immediately focus our attention on another troubled bank. SDB was in much worse shape than KFB had been when we had first taken it over. But the market potential in China was so much greater.
