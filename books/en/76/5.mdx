title: 5 Deadline Looming
---






I considered legal action against the Korean government an absolute last resort, and for the moment it seemed as if I might not need it. The following day, March 16, we had a six-hour meeting with the FSC in its office, during which the FSC team finally agreed to using forward-looking international best practices instead of Korean standards for assessing and classifying loans. We agreed that the guidelines would be worked out by advisors of both parties and implemented by the management of KFB.

This meeting also brought an interesting change in the negotiation dynamics: Gokul Laroia, a vice president at Morgan Stanley, took the lead during our discussions. The FSC team members did not say much. According to Laroia, the Morgan Stanley and PwC teams had spent a lot of time working with the FSC to agree to use forward-looking standards. Unfortunately, there remained a sizable gap between our positions on the mark-to-market and other issues, so I had no choice but to reject their offer. But at least, I thought, this was a start.

My optimism did not last long. The next day we returned to the conference room of the FSC's office to pick up where we had left off. At the beginning of the meeting I began to propose that advisors from both sides work out the guidelines for forward-looking loan classification, as we had agreed a day earlier. This time, however, BS Kang, who was leading the FSC negotiations, said that he needed to consult with his superiors before he could agree to using the forward-looking classification methodology.

I had barely recovered from my surprise when Dr. Sang-mook Lee chimed in. Dr. Lee was a deputy director in the Banking System Division of Korea's Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE). He had recently joined the negotiations as an observer.

“The FSC did not share its latest proposal with MOFE prior to discussing it with Newbridge,” Dr. Lee said, noting that the ministry was “disturbed” by the offer and considered its terms to be too generous to Newbridge. He hinted darkly that we were unlikely to get approval from the various ministers for the deal without significant changes.

“That's fine,” I responded, “because the current proposal was equally unacceptable to Newbridge.” Then I turned to Kang and asked, “Does the FSC have the authority to negotiate with us or not?” Kang assured me it did. However, he went on to state that his latest proposal was indeed final, even if it meant the deal would collapse.

At this point I saw no reason to continue talking. As we were leaving the building, I passed Chairman Lee in the hall. “How are the negotiations coming along?” he wanted to know.

“Not well,” I said.

* * *

For the first time we had gotten a taste of the internal politics inside the Korean government with regard to the KFB deal. To begin with, it was clear that some rivalry existed between the FSC and the MOFE. The ministry had not been directly involved in negotiating the MOU, and I knew that the finance minister had voted against the deal. Just minutes before we signed the MOU, he had also insisted we sweeten it by increasing the amount of warrants KFB would grant the government. Now, it seemed, the MOFE wanted direct representation in the negotiation process. And its representative, Dr. Lee, wanted to turn back the clock.

Then there was the problem of Director General Noh. I found all the Korean officials we had come in contact with to be professional, hardworking, and courteous. Noh was the exception. In meetings he sat looking aloof and stern. Square-jawed, with jet-black hair combed over to one side, he would stare at visitors with narrowed and expressionless eyes behind a pair of light-rimmed glasses. He never smiled. He presented himself as being important and distant, yet he seemed incapable of making decisions. His negotiation style was to reject everything we proposed—on the rare occasions he came to a session. It was almost impossible to engage in a real discussion with him to resolve any issues. It was obvious he did not like the MOU and I felt he was hostile to the deal from day one.

According to our advisor Jihong Kim, it was going to be very difficult to ask the higher authorities to replace Noh as the lead negotiator. Jihong knew most of the players in this drama well, and he explained to me that Chairman Lee remained supportive of the deal, but his hands were tied. Noh was from a rival political faction, one that often did not share President DJ Kim's agenda.

To get around the issue, Jihong proposed that Chairman Lee create a steering committee to help oversee the negotiating process. There were people in the Korean government who were loyal to the cause of President Kim's banking reforms. A committee with some of those supporters would undermine Noh's authority and help alleviate the current stalemate. While I was a bit concerned that having the wrong people on the steering committee would more deeply entrench the FSC in its position, Jihong assured me that the chairman was eager for a chance to neutralize Noh in order to push this deal through.

But until that could happen, we needed to prove to Chairman Lee and to everyone involved in the KFB negotiations that Newbridge meant business. Recently, our team had discussed sending a strongly worded letter to Chairman Lee, outlining in blunt terms our concerns with the current state of the negotiations and emphasizing that we were running out of time. It was time, I felt, to send that letter.

The letter, which I had drafted for Blum's signature and which was sent on March 18, 1999, began by stating that, from our perspective, “the negotiation has all but collapsed.” It went on to highlight that the terms of the MOU were a key part of communicating Korea's determination to restructure its banking sector to adhere to international best practices. Blum noted:

But during the past ten weeks since the MOU was signed, the FSC has repeatedly challenged key concepts in the proposed transaction…. This pattern of negotiation, which does not appear to have changed materially since our meeting, is of great concern to Newbridge as it calls into question the viability of the entire transaction.



Blum concluded, “I believe we have come to a critical point in the negotiations and that further delay would be fatal.”

* * *

Just as I was trying to light a fire under the Korean negotiators, I was trying to put one out in Newbridge's backyard. Jim Warner, the TPG associate who had been seconded to the Newbridge team, wrote a memo to Bonderman and others at TPG, expressing his concern that my last proposal to the FSC was too generous to the government side.

“My primary concern is making sure we mark correctly the loan portfolio we decide to keep,” he wrote. We proposed to the FSC a weighted average mark of 87.5 percent on the loan portfolio. This price, Warner thought, “does not seem to mitigate the fact that 55% of the loans within the won-denominated loan bucket (the largest bucket) have 1997 EBITDA/Total Interest coverage of less than 1.”

EBITDA stands for earnings before interest payment, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which is a broad measure of the operating cash flow of a company. In plain English, Warner was saying that the borrowers of 55 percent of KFB's loans were not generating enough cash from operations to pay even the interest on their loans, let alone the principal. He wondered how we could justify marking down KFB's loan book to 87.5 percent of book value, when it was clear more than half of its loans were at risk of default. Warner concluded that I was making “irresponsible/unauthorized economic trade-offs in order to get the deal done.”

For some reason, Warner had not spoken with me about his reservations. I only found out about them when Bonderman showed me his memo and questioned me about the points Warner raised. I thought it was ironic that a member of our own team thought we were compromising too much, while the government side thought we were compromising too little. We had to sort out our differences internally before we could further negotiate with the FSC team. The gap between us and the government, it seemed, was not narrowing but widening.

Warner's data was correct, but he did not see the whole picture. It was true that most of KFB's loans were in bad shape, but under the terms of the MOU, these loans would no longer be our problem. They would be put to the government either before or a year or two after the deal was closed.

While it went without saying that a deeper discount would be more beneficial for Newbridge, the real question was what the correct mark should be. According to our analysis, an 87.5 percent mark would produce an adequate yield to reflect the borrowers' credit risk and provide sufficient downside protection if a borrower's ability to repay was impaired. Our proposal also meant that we would get a discount of 12.5 percent even on the good loans, and, given our existing put right, we would get a year or more to look at all of the loans to see whether we could work them out, or restructure them in such a way to enable the borrowers to repay. Meanwhile, we would be getting an attractive yield, on a risk-free basis, through the interest payments on the loans.

As I wrote to Bonderman, “whether we can live with a particular mark, whatever the agreed methodology produces, depends, as you point out, on the quality of the loans we get to keep or on how much freedom we have to select the loan portfolio by using pre- and post-close put rights.” The last point was critically important. If we could not exercise our right to put bad loans back to the government, almost no mark would work for us. Turning around a failed bank was like starting from a deep valley to climb a tall mountain. To make it to the top, KFB would need to unload its heaviest baggage—the bad loans.

Warner and I met with a few others in the team to talk, and we quickly reached consensus that our proposed mark would work for us.

Meanwhile Bonderman, had invited a few close advisors to provide analysis. He wrote: “In a nutshell… this deal could work nicely… but it will be a longer and tougher slog than we might think. Our success would rely on diversifying KFB’s customer base, which hinged in part on the growth of Korea’s overall economy. That could mean our projected three-year turnaround time was overly optimistic. There was also the issue of finding a new CEO for KFB. Not everyone would be up to the challenge.”

On March 23, 1999, with five weeks left to make a deal, my colleague Paul Chen; two bankers from Lehman Brothers, O'Hanlon of Lehman and Jack Rodman of E&Y; and I met with Noh and his team at the FSC. In my notes from that day I characterized the conversation with Noh as “shadowboxing.” Noh told us he liked the “top-down mark” approach, which we had proposed as the alternative to valuating every individual loan. Even though he did not agree with our proposed mark, he concurred that we should value the portfolio as a whole. It was a good chance for me to test a theory I had about how Noh negotiated.

The reason we proposed the methodology of a top-down mark was because we had expected the parties to agree to our mark quickly. But if we couldn't agree to the mark, then the top-down approach had failed and we might as well go back to the bottom-up methodology.

“Mr. Shan, I think the top-down mark is the right way to do it,” Noh replied. “We insist on using this methodology.”

The more I argued to withdraw Newbridge's own proposal, the more insistent Noh became on using the methodology. And this was, in fact, just what I wanted. I had learned how his mind worked. He did not really know what he wanted, so he would push to test our limits. If I said yes, he would think there was still room to push us and wouldn't accept a deal. But if I said no, he would think he had squeezed the last drop out of us, so he would insist.

Whether it was our new approach to dealing with Director General Noh or some impetus from within the FSC, we finally seemed to be making some headway in our negotiations. I suspected that this was due in part to the fact that it was difficult for the FSC to publicly defend its opposition to international best practices at a time when the international market was watching closely for signs of structural reforms in the Korean economy. Therefore, despite the objections from the MOFE's Dr. Lee, assessing loans based on the concept of international best practices was at last back on the table, although the parties still could not agree on what exactly those practices should be.

We met with Director BS Kang and his team on the afternoon of March 25. I told them that our proposal of a mark of 87.5 percent remained valid, but then we moved on to discuss other issues. We agreed to let the advisors on both sides draft the loan classification guidelines and other relevant documents.

“I would characterize today's meeting as ‘constructive,’” I wrote in an internal memo later that day. We had been so stymied by the uncompromising positions taken by the FSC team in meeting after meeting, we were happy to see any sign of loosening on their side. A second memo, drafted by Paul Chen, listed the issues discussed at the meeting. We reported, with some glee in our tone, that we had “actually made progress” and that Noh had agreed to gather his advisors to discuss the issues we wanted to have resolved. It seemed as if we were finally getting back on track.

By March, the Korean press was keenly interested in the progress and status of the negotiations between the FSC and Newbridge, and coverage was picking up. The government negotiators were influenced by public opinion both at home and abroad. They were concerned with the views expressed by the Korean press, fearful of getting savaged in public for giving away Korea's crown jewel. However, the sentiment of foreign investors was important to Korea's economic recovery, so the government didn't want to be perceived as reneging on the MOU either.

For decades, the press in South Korea had been heavily censored. Its authoritarian president, Chung-hee Park, shut down most of the country's major newspapers in the 1960s; his successor, Doo-hwan Chun, nationalized the news agencies and television broadcasters. But in the late 1980s, as the country began to liberalize, Korea's media expanded. By the time of the KFB deal, the nation had a freewheeling and influential free press, although I learned with some difficulty that journalists still deferred to the government in certain matters.

As the period of exclusivity dwindled, I met with a reporter from the Korea Times. Our interview would appear in an article titled “Newbridge to Fully Respect MOU.” The reporter called me to say that the FSC had asked to review the article before publication—something unthinkable in most Western countries—but didn't request any changes and let the article go to press as the reporter had written it.

We knew the FSC used the Korean press to sway public opinion and send us not-so-subtle messages. Noh, in particular, was quite fond of planting stories, though he did it rather clumsily, leaving no doubt as to who had planted them. He also did not seem to want to share the media spotlight. In an effort to present a united front to the media and to better sell our deal to the public, I'd set up a lunch meeting with the FSC spokeswoman, Sandy Park, only to learn that the meeting was canceled at the order of Mr. Noh. I did not know what Noh was afraid of, but he obviously did not want the FSC spokesperson getting to know us.

We knew that if the government wanted to walk away, it would not want to be blamed for the deal's falling apart. Therefore, it was often difficult to tell whether a slight softening in Noh's position was an earnest effort to reach agreement on difficult issues or merely a way to shift blame from his side. What we were reading in the press was certainly at odds with some of the positive signs we observed across the negotiation table.

On March 26 a leading Korean newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, published an article under the headline: “Is Newbridge the Only Option?” The question was obviously rhetorical. The article first quoted an unnamed “branch manager of a foreign investment banking firm,” who pointed out that the MOU was not a legal contract and opined that it gave Newbridge too good a deal. The article relied on other unidentified sources and cited a reported rumor that unnamed people at the IMF “joked that Newbridge has found an easy target in Korea First Bank.” It then blamed the IMF for requiring that the Korean government sell two distressed banks in order to receive bailout assistance. It suggested that it would be better for the country to get rid of Korea First Bank and set up a new one rather than injecting so much capital into it. The article went on to say:

Financial authorities who had been part of the Korea First Bank sell-off talks said, “It is true that the MOU signing was done hurriedly, but Newbridge was the only candidate at the time and we had no other choice,” but added, “The government's pledge with the IMF to sell off two troubled banks—Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank—was a complete blunder in terms of M&A strategy.”



It was a hatchet job, and it had Noh's fingerprints all over it. The thinly sourced, anonymous quotes were a staple of Korean business reporting, which at its worst was little better than gossip. The remark about getting rid of the bank and setting up a new one revealed the writer's ignorance. Apparently, the writer did not understand that the government was responsible for repaying all the deposits and liabilities of the bank and could not simply get rid of them. But I thought the attempt to disguise the true source of the article by citing anonymous sources at foreign firms was laughable. No one in the international community, especially at the IMF and World Bank, thought South Korea should walk away from the deal.

The article's conclusion was telling, and probably as indicative of Noh's true intentions as anything we'd been able to get from him across the bargaining table: “A negotiation expert”—it wasn't difficult to guess who that was—“says that if the deal is not working out, you do not have to comply with the MOU, but you have to come up with proof that it is not Korea's fault. Otherwise, departing from the MOU will undermine Korea's credibility.”

That was the bind Noh found himself in. Newbridge had consistently pushed to abide by the MOU, and had said so publicly. It was his side that wanted to walk away from it. But Noh also knew that to do so would make Korea look bad to the international community, which would potentially jeopardize the loans and investments that the country was depending on to help get back on its feet. Therefore, we suspected Noh was only pretending to accept such concepts as international best practices; in fact, he might not have had any intention of following them.

In spite of the progress we'd seemed to be making in recent days, the Chosun Ilbo article raised new doubts in my mind as to whether the FSC team was negotiating in good faith. Bonderman drafted a letter for Blum to send to Director General Noh on March 26, highlighting our continued belief that the core principles of the MOU were vital to the agreement and that we would not accept anything less. The letter read at least partly as a rebuttal to the Chosun Ilbo article. We thought it much better to let Noh know we were not falling for his tricks and that we had every intention of holding the FSC to the principles of the MOU. As we were losing confidence that any progress could be made in our negotiations with Mr. Noh and as we wanted to put some pressure on him, the letter concluded by referring to the suggestion made by Chairman Lee in his last meeting with Blum:

Accordingly, while I accept Chairman Lee's decision that the senior people would wait until mid-April to get together to resolve the transaction in the absence of agreement by the negotiating teams, I think you should advise Chairman Lee to reserve several days on his calendar in mid-April since it now appears likely that this transaction will only be negotiated at the most senior levels absent of major progress in the coming weeks.



As we entered the month of April, I felt like we were punching air every day in our meetings with the FSC. As the deadline drew closer, there was much speculation in the press about what was holding up negotiations. Many articles in the Korean press, citing government sources, suggested that the lack of progress was due to Newbridge. We were concerned that the position of the FSC team and the negative press were reinforcing each other.

On April 2, in the middle of another fruitless meeting with the FSC negotiators, I was summoned to Noh's office. Seated behind his desk, he rattled off a list of points he wanted to impress upon me, while an interpreter sitting next to me translated. First of all, he said, the government would never forget that Newbridge stepped up to sign a deal during Korea's most difficult time. This was something I had been waiting for him to remember, but his behavior still contradicted this claim. He also stated that the government was committed to a successful transaction with Newbridge. The emphasis, surprisingly, was his. However, he was concerned by the timing and content of our recent letters that took issue with how the deal was being portrayed in the press and questioning the FSC's intentions. The government remained staunchly in support of the MOU, and intended to stick with it, regardless of what the press said. If the government was misquoted in the media on this subject, he told me, they would take the necessary steps to clarify.

Just before I was called into my meeting with Noh, the FSC negotiators had insisted to me that no one from their team had spoken with the media. This would have been more believable if I hadn't had to wait outside Noh's office while he was finishing a meeting with a group of reporters.

* * *

Winning the battle for public opinion was critically important, and the press was an important weapon. But so far we had been operating at a disadvantage. The FSC team wanted a much better deal than the MOU but couldn't be seen to be walking away from the table; it had to make it look like it was Newbridge that was at fault. The public did not know the true story, and the local press naturally reflected nationalistic sentiment. I decided it was important to build a good relationship with the press and to correct any misperceptions. It was tricky to manage: We had to keep the specifics of the negotiation confidential. Nonetheless, communicating with the press and, through it, with the public, became an important part of my job.

There was a good deal of interest among the reporters, both Korean and foreign, in speaking with us and learning about the progress in negotiations. From time to time I met with reporters from most of the major English publications and got to know many of them well. Hyung-min Kim, a journalist at the Korea Times, was in the habit of calling me “Dr. Shan” or occasionally just “Doctor,” which I found quite amusing. It reminded me of a cartoon in the New Yorker magazine, in which the maîtred' at a fancy restaurant was talking into the telephone: “A party of four at seven-thirty in the name of Dr. Jennings. May I ask whether that is an actual medical degree or merely a Ph.D.?” As a mere PhD, I found Hyung-min's deference a little over the top, but I appreciated his earnestness.

Back in January, the Korea Times, the nation's leading English-language daily, had been critical of our deal. But after Hyung-min Kim spent some time with me learning the ins and outs of the MOU, the paper's coverage was much more balanced.

One day in April, he faxed me an advance copy of an article, scheduled to appear in his newspaper the following day, with a note that he would be happy to talk with me again, whenever I wanted. The article was essentially a report on an interview he'd conducted with a director of the World Bank. It clarified that the position of the World Bank was that the deal outlined in the MOU was the deal the international community was expecting—and one that had strong global support. Sri Ram Aiyer, director of the World Bank in Seoul, was quoted: “A deal is a deal. Whether it is an MOU or a final contract, it is something agreed to be respected by the two sides.” Aiyer went on to explain that foreign investment in Korea was still seen as incredibly risky, making it unappealing to many investors. This was an important reminder, considering the optimism many Koreans were feeling since the HSBC deal had been made. Finally Aiyer pointed out that just a year ago, Newbridge had confidence in Korea's economy—while all other foreign investors were fleeing.

I had never met or even spoke with Aiyer, but I was impressed not only by his views but also by how candid he was. I sent the article around to my colleagues and remarked in the cover note: “Uncharacteristic of these multilateral agencies, he is refreshingly vocal on our behalf.”

* * *

With less than a month left in the exclusivity period, there was still no sign the FSC team was making an effort to reach a final agreement with us. To all appearances, they were running out the clock until our exclusivity expired. We decided to set up a meeting among Chairman Lee, Blum, and Bonderman, our two co-chairs, in the hope of resolving the key issues. This chairmen’s meeting was scheduled April 16, just two weeks before the end of our exclusivity period.

As the date approached, we made careful preparations for the meeting. Carroll and I wanted to establish a friendly atmosphere as early as possible. We suggested that Blum and Bonderman each bring a small gift that reflected a bit about them personally. Both Chairman Lee and Bonderman had connections to Harvard—the former attended the university's Advanced Management Program and the latter was its law school’s trustee—so we decided that Bonderman would bring some memento from Harvard—a pair of cuff links with the Harvard crest on them. Blum, an avid mountaineer, would bring a book about the first successful conquest of Mount Everest, the summit by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepalese, in 1953. He would attach a photo of himself on the mountain to reveal a little bit about his personality in hope of making a deeper connection with Chairman Lee and breaking the ice.

While we were preparing our peace offerings, it seemed as if the FSC was getting ready for war. The pressure only increased as we drew closer to the date of the meeting. In the days leading up to the chairmen's meeting, I received numerous phone calls from reporters inquiring about the status of the negotiations. These included not only Korean reporters but also foreign journalists from the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. Local newspapers were awash with articles predicting the collapse of negotiations and blaming Newbridge for the failure. Indeed, the Korea Times seemed to be the only domestic English newspaper expressing support for the deal. Sensing a small advantage, I briefed the Korea Times reporters and told them that, contrary to the press speculation, the gap between the two parties was narrowing.

A few days before the meeting I also received a call from Harrison Young, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, the FSC's advisor.

“You are about to lose this deal,” he told me flatly. He didn't say anything else, but the implication was clear: We would have to make more concessions to salvage the deal.

Until that point the FSC had delivered most of its threats through the press, so I took the word of a senior executive at Morgan Stanley very seriously. We didn't think he would pass the message along without truly believing it, a fact that filled us with anxiety, but there wasn't much else we could do. If the threat was intended to wring more concessions from us, we did not have anything to give. The chairmen's meeting seemed our only hope to save it.

* * *

Blum and Bonderman arrived from San Francisco on April 15, and the next day we met with Chairman Lee and his team in the biggest conference room at the FSC. I entered the meeting in a hopeful frame of mind. We were seated at a long table on our side of the room, and the FSC team sat at their own long table on the other side of the room, with a wide space between us. Bonderman and Blum presented their gifts to the chairman and he thanked them, then we turned our attention to business. I had sent the FSC team our revised term sheet and issue list in advance, to allow Chairman Lee some time to prepare.

To our great surprise, instead of reviewing the key issues, Chairman Lee read a prepared statement. He began by accusing Newbridge of speaking with third parties, such as the World Bank. Apparently he had been infuriated by the Korea Times interview with Aiyer of the World Bank. There was no opportunity for me to explain that I had never spoken with Aiyer and that I was as surprised as Chairman Lee to see the article.

Lee continued, “Money isn't a problem for us. We want Newbridge to bring two things, experience and management.” He explained that the Korean government and citizenry didn't have faith that we could deliver either one.

Bonderman responded, after a brief pause, that Newbridge and the government shared the same objectives. In an attempt to get the meeting back on track, he said, “Going back to the chairman's comments and the MOU, our question is: what is a clean bank? If the mark-to-market is resolved, all the other issues are easy. Let's focus on that one issue and get it resolved.”

But Lee would not engage. Instead he said, “Don't burn down a house to kill a tick.”

I'd never heard such an expression before, and under different circumstances I might have found it charming, but it revealed the chasm between Newbridge and the government. We had considered the mark-to-market factor to be the most important issue in the deal, but the chairman considered it a “tick,” a tiny irritation.

Blum spoke up. “The bank should be made good by international standards. But, of course, the market is in Korea. The difference between the two parties is like arguing about if the glass is half empty or half full.”

Lee said nothing further. He stood up and left the meeting, leaving our two co-chairmen staring across the room at Director General Noh, who responded with his usual aloof gaze.

We were all quite shocked by Lee's angry tone and abrupt departure. We had nothing to do with the views expressed by the World Bank director, who was unlikely to do our bidding in any case. Korean government officials were clearly angry that the World Bank's view resonated with ours, which made walking away from the MOU much harder for them, because selling at least one of the two nationalized banks was one of the conditions for the $58 billion rescue package the IMF and the World Bank had provided to South Korea.

Once Chairman Lee was out of the room, Noh presided over the rest of the meeting. Junior Lee began to go through a list of the government's positions on a number of issues, including how to value the liabilities of the bank, which included its deposits or any other borrowings on which the bank might owe interest. I was surprised to learn that the FSC team now wanted to mark down the value of the demand deposit on the liability side, which would have the effect of marking up the value of the assets. (For example, if you owe a creditor $1,000 less, then your net worth becomes $1,000 more.) I thought the argument was bizarre because if the bank owed a depositor 100,000 won, there were no grounds to argue it owed less than 100,000 won. As in the United States, deposits were fully insured by the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, so their full value would be paid to depositors. By the time Junior Lee was through with his list, the FSC had rejected all of our proposals. As in the past, they did not give us reasons for their rejections.

After Junior Lee finished, Bonderman noted, “If there is no mark to market on the assets of the bank, there shouldn't be any mark to market on the side of liabilities.” We thought there was no reason why any of the bank's liabilities should not be marked at par and nothing could justify a different approach.

Instead of addressing Bonderman's point, Noh said, “I take issue with Mr. Bonderman's statement.” Then he began his own diatribe, blaming Newbridge for the stalled negotiations.

Just before entering the room, Blum had taken me aside and said, “Shan, when you negotiate with their team, it is important to keep your cool and be patient.” Apparently he had heard that I had lost my cool on a couple of occasions. I knew he was right, so I nodded in agreement.

At this point in the meeting, as Noh went on and on making accusations against us for stalling the negotiations, I could tell that Blum was getting more and more agitated; his expression was tense and his eyes became sharp. When he finally had the chance to speak, he began to pound the table. Sitting next to him, I gently pulled his sleeve to calm him down. Red in the face, he abruptly turned to me and bellowed, “How have you put up with this shit for so long?”

The meeting was adjourned, and, again, nothing was achieved. We all felt quite dejected. After months of negotiations, it looked as if the FSC team was preparing to walk away from the transaction. It felt like all of our efforts—the late-night meetings, the time away from our families—had been in vain. It was Friday, the beginning of the weekend. We all left Seoul without knowing what would come next.

* * *

On Sunday, back in Hong Kong, I bumped into Philip Gilligan on the street. Philip was a lawyer at White & Case, the firm acting as legal counsel for the FSC. His partner, Eric Yoon, had been at Friday's meeting and thought it had gone well. Needless to say, I was baffled. Philip explained that Lee's stern statement was merely positioning because the FSC was concerned we were going to pull out of the negotiations.

To me, the FSC's interpretation of our position defied common sense. Our two chairmen had flown all the way from the United States to try to save the deal. How could the FSC have thought we were about walk away?

I conferred with Harrison Young of Morgan Stanley and thought his interpretation was more logical. Views within the Korean government were still divided, he told me, and even Morgan Stanley, the government's advisor, did not know where things stood. He said we should wait until we knew exactly what the government side intended to do.

* * *

Nearly a week went by before we heard anything from the FSC. Then, on April 22, we were surprised to receive a proposal from its negotiating team. Even though many of the terms were unacceptable, it showed that the FSC still wanted to talk. Perhaps the situation was not as bad as we had thought.

We met with the FSC team the next day. The purpose of the meeting, from our point of view, was to get clarification on the terms included in their proposal. Noh started the meeting by saying that he hoped our discussion would end in a good result. I think he was expecting to hear whether we would accept the FSC's proposal. As it became clear that we were only seeking clarification and would reserve feedback until we had a chance to review the discussion points, Noh, apparently bored with the technical details, left the meeting not long after it began.

The rest of the discussion was cordial and engaging. The FSC's negotiators were willing to explain their rationale and answer our questions. They seemed also willing to listen to what we had to say. We agreed to meet again the following Tuesday, April 27, to give them our response.

After the meeting I reached out to one of the FSC team members whom I had gotten to know well. In spite of the progress we'd just made, he was worried. He told me confidentially that the FSC was not going to be flexible on the terms of its proposal. He told me that the FSC's position was hardened by what it perceived as a real improvement in the financial markets and credit conditions in Korea. The latest proposal, he said, was pretty much the best his team could do.

The market sentiment was, in fact, improving. Earlier that month the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs would invest about $500 million in Kookmin Bank, one of Korea's largest retail banks, to become its largest shareholder. The deal would give Goldman Sachs a 16.8 percent stake in the company and a seat on the board, although it would not get management control. This was seen as a signal to the market that the worst was over—or at least that foreign investors were willing to buy into a Korean bank at a premium, instead of at a discount, to its net asset value. I was afraid the new deal would also raise questions in the minds of the government and the public as to why the KFB deal, which included Newbridge's taking management control, was still necessary.

I proposed stepping up our public relations effort by holding a briefing session with reporters. This would serve the dual purpose of informing the public of our position, which we considered reasonable and in line with the MOU, and showing the FSC that we would not put up with being blamed for slowing down or disrupting the deal. The new proposal from the FSC gave us reason to question whether my plan was prudent. There was some concern among the Newbridge team that a press briefing would be seen by the FSC as a deliberate provocation, causing it to respond in the same way Chairman Lee had after he read the interview with Aiyer of the World Bank about the deal. If that happened, it would prompt an unfavorable backlash, causing the FSC to dig in further or decide to walk away from the deal. We'd already seen how badly they'd responded to positive news coverage about our position, and some of my colleagues feared the press conference would undo the progress we had just made.

Still, I decided to proceed because I was convinced the deal was not going to happen without public support. And I believed the deal was in the best interests of all parties. Not only did we need it, but the government needed it too. The press conference was scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, April 27, just a few hours before our afternoon meeting with the FSC.

In the days leading up to the press conference, I frequently spoke with reporters, especially Michael Schuman of the Wall Street Journal, John Burton of the Financial Times, and Hyung-min Kim of the Korea Times. I kept them informed of the status of the negotiation while making sure not to disclose any specifics. In return, they often let me know what they were hearing from the government side. I found the quid pro quo to be beneficial. It was clear that the FSC was not only managing the Korean press but the foreign press as well.

The longer the negotiations stretched on, the worse Korea First Bank's situation became. In early April, the FSC had notified KFB to prepare to receive a capital injection of another 2 to 3 trillion Korean won (about $1.7–2.5 billion), in addition to 2 to 3 trillion won it had already received from the government. All the infused capital was to fill the hole created by loan losses as the equity capital had long been wiped out before the bank’s nationalization. The bank was in dire need of capital, and, as negotiations stalled, the government had to pump in more money to keep the bank afloat and operating. Meanwhile, Won-kyu Choi, a member of KFB's management team, told me that the employees' union of the KFB was strongly supportive of a takeover by Newbridge. Knowing that the bank's employees were in favor of our deal could sway local public opinion in our favor and would be another thing the government had to acknowledge.

That same week as our press conference, South Korea's president, Dae-jung Kim, met with the heads of the top five chaebols and other important Korean business leaders. Shee-yul Ryoo, the head of KFB, was there, as was Chairman Lee. The president asked Lee about the KFB deal with Newbridge and requested that Lee provide a report on our progress. The Newbridge team was encouraged by the news because it showed that support for our deal still existed at the very top level of government. That was a sign that the FSC would have a hard time walking away.

The day before the press conference and FSC meeting, both the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times published articles saying that the Korean government might pull out of the sale of KFB to Newbridge. Dow Jones, Bloomberg, and the Korea Economic Daily all called me for comment. Clearly, the government side was beginning a press offensive against us.

At 11 am the following day, in a room at Korea First Bank's headquarters that was packed with reporters, I began my press briefing. Choi of KFB, who spoke English fluently, translated for me. Choi was a good man, candid and strongly supportive of the deal. Noh had called the bank prior to the press conference in an attempt to dissuade him from acting as my translator, but Choi ignored Noh's pressure and accompanied me. I thought it took a lot of courage for a bank employee to defy a senior official from the bank's own regulator, and it signaled that Choi was strongly supportive of the transaction.

I began by apologizing for not being able to speak more than a few words in Korean and for having not met with the press sooner. Then I said:

But I am studying the language, the history and the culture of Korea. We didn't hold a press briefing earlier because we thought it was better to do more and talk less. However, we see much misperception of Newbridge in the press and we feel a responsibility to explain to you what we are and what we are not.

We are not a hedge fund. We are not short-term investors. Short-term investors don't invest in a down market. But we do.

We are a private equity investment firm. We are turnaround specialists. We typically make a long-term investment to create value for stakeholders. We are good corporate citizens. We have the capital and experience to recapitalize and turn around Korea First Bank. We have a successful track record, which is why Morgan Stanley invited us to bid for the bank. The government signed the MOU with us because our proposal was the best the government had received.



I went on to explain why Newbridge wanted to invest in Korea:

First, we have strong confidence in the Korean people, who are industrious and who have the potential to compete successfully in the world market. Second, we believe in Korea's commitment to reform. Third, we know how to turn around failed banks better than anyone. We have a world-class team.



During the back-and-forth with reporters, I emphasized that we shared two common goals with the Korean government: running a clean bank and adopting international best practices. I highlighted the significant upside for the government in the deal and the fact that it would be a benchmark for banking reform in Korea. I described the credit culture that we were poised to build at KFB and how that would launch the bank to be a worthy international competitor.

“Would there be layoffs?” a reporter asked. I explained that we didn't have plans to fire anyone and that we looked forward to working with KFB's existing employees and management. By that point KFB's chairman, Shee-yul Ryoo, had made significant cuts to payroll so we didn't think further reductions would be necessary.

Everyone knew that our exclusivity under the MOU would expire in about a week, so reporters were eager to know how the negotiations were going.

I held my tongue and focused only on the positives. I described the deal as a perfect and respectful marriage with the Korean government. Of course, there were some disagreements, I said, but we respected the FSC negotiators. Besides, it would be a lose-lose outcome if the deal fell apart.

“What is the cost of not doing this deal?” I asked rhetorically. I didn't need to answer the question because the implication was clear: If the deal fell through, the government would be in violation of its agreement with the IMF and World Bank for the $58 billion rescue package. Taxpayers would be on the hook for all the money they had sunk into KFB. Plus, it would take more money to keep the bank afloat.

What would happen to the deal after the exclusivity period expired? That I refused to discuss. In truth, I had no clue.

The next day, all the major newspapers, domestic and foreign, covered my statements. In general, the reaction was positive. It seemed the press briefing was a success. At least, it managed to crush all the lies about Newbridge being greedy and unreasonable. Even Korea's finance ministry responded to my press briefing favorably, issuing a statement to say it supported the Newbridge-KFB deal. Only the FSC was unhappy with my press conference, as I heard, although it kept quiet.

* * *

Despite the economic pressures faced by KFB and the sustained top-level attention to the deal, the FSC team's negotiating strategy was very much the same when we sat across the table from them once again on the day of my press conference. Once again things stalled, and it became clear that we wouldn't make any headway.

As the negotiations broke down, we felt intense pressure to figure out what was going on within the government. To do so we had engaged a New York–based advisory firm to help us. Its two principals, whom I will not name, were said to be well versed and well connected with Seoul's political scene. They imbued an air of secrecy, intrigue, and paranoia in our minds, regaling us with tales of scheming as they described the political factions that were fighting for or against the reform agenda of President Dae-jung Kim.

They also told us that our phones and fax lines were bugged and that the government negotiators would know of any strategies or gambits we had discussed on internal conference calls. The hotel phones and our mobile phones were equally unsafe. After this, we were careful not to discuss confidential information over unsecured lines. Unfortunately, that left us without any secure means of communication, other than running out to find a public phone to make calls. I remember a few times Paul Chen had to run out in the rain to a phone booth across the street from the hotel to make a confidential call. All we could do was to minimize the risk of leaks by not saying much in our calls and memos until we were out of Korea.

Our advisors told us that South Korea's intelligence apparatus not only listened to our conversations but also had a codename for each of us. David Bonderman, apparently, was known by the codename “Kim Chee,” after Kimchi, the spicy pickled cabbage found in every Korean kitchen. In order to keep our secrets, our advisors gave each of us a codename to use. They even assigned codenames for us to use for each of them. One advisor's codename was “Tall Guy” and the other was “Short Guy.” I was “Thin Guy.” Dan Carroll was “Handsome Guy.”

Even with all these measures of secrecy, I did not exactly feel like James Bond. If these conspiracy theories were true, I thought, Korean intelligence agents were likely much more creative and professional than we were. Our codenames weren't going to fool anyone. If you were to put us all in a lineup, my seven-year-old daughter would easily tell who was Tall Guy, Short Guy, Thin Guy, and Handsome Guy. If anything, it was probably easier to identify us by our codenames than by our real names.

Tall Guy and Short Guy brought a couple of people to see us. They claimed to know what was going on within the government and that they could connect us with those who could influence decision making in the National Assembly and the Blue House. But I never knew whether what the visitors told us was true. I did visit some Assembly representatives and Blue House officials, as arranged by Tall Guy and Short Guy, to brief them on the deal status and on our plans for KFB. I had no idea if those visits did any good. But I thought they were useful nonetheless because if we wanted to educate the public by briefing the press from time to time, we might as well do the same with politicians. At this point, the KFB deal was drawing so much public attention that it felt like Korea's national pastime. We did not know who was for or against the deal, but it was prudent to win as many friends and as much support and sympathy for it as possible.

In the days running up to the expiration of exclusivity, Tall Guy and Short Guy repeatedly told us that ours was a done deal. They even had specific predictions for when the government would sign, but I had my doubts. There was no hint of willingness across the negotiation table, and there were no documents to sign. Each time, the closing date that Tall Guy and Short Guy identified came and went without a deal, and each time our advisors found some plausible explanation for the failure.

I spoke with Short Guy on May 2, 1999, hours before the midnight expiration of our exclusivity. He continued to insist it was a “done deal,” but he warned me: “The deal cannot be won at the table, but it can be lost at the table.” I did not really think about what he said at the time, but in retrospect I realized the import of what he meant. If we completed the deal, I would not be able to take any credit, because “the deal cannot be won at the table.” But if the deal did not happen, it would be all my fault, because the deal “can be lost at the table.” As I wrote in my notebook later, “so the strategy is to hold the line and wait for things to work out behind the scenes.”

The two days leading up to the May 2 deadline were unnerving and somewhat confusing. The FSC had flatly rejected our most recent proposal and, in fact, widened the gap by proposing to mark down the value of the bank's deposits by 1.5 trillion won (about $1.2 billion).

We did not know what to make of these theatrics. The FSC had pushed their position so far from our proposals that it seemed impossible that we would find a compromise. It seemed, in fact, like the FSC team had no intention of trying to bridge our two positions.

Meanwhile, other bidders began circling: Regent Pacific, a Hong Kong–based hedge fund, publicly announced on May 1 that it would send in an offer with much better terms than Newbridge's after our exclusivity expired.

After strategizing among ourselves, we decided to let Mike O'Hanlon of Lehman lead the discussions on May 1. The hope was that the FSC team would be a bit more relaxed and wouldn't feel as if each comment during the negotiation was a statement for the record.

The strategy achieved some measure of success; the FSC side did seem a bit less tense when they felt that they were dealing with a slightly neutral third party. But they remained as unyielding as ever and continued to demand that we accept their April 22 proposal, which we had already rejected. O'Hanlon informed them we could only negotiate on the basis of our most recent proposal, made on April 27. The gap between those terms and the ones that the FSC had proposed in earlier negotiations was relatively narrow and seemed easy to bridge. Left unsaid was how far the FSC had moved away from its own bargaining position in the intervening month. Before we wrapped up for the day, O'Hanlon left on the table a compromise offer, which we followed up on in writing later that day.

That afternoon, with some eight hours remaining before the deadline, the entire Newbridge and Lehman team went to the FSC's office for a final meeting. We had learned from a source there that Chairman Lee had attended every internal meeting held that day on this transaction. This was the first time we heard that the negotiation team on the other side might have received some signal from the top.

Before we finished exchanging pleasantries, I was summoned to Noh's office. O'Hanlon and I went together. O'Hanlon briefly explained our new proposal to Noh, and Noh replied that the government would need some time to review it and give us feedback. O'Hanlon then brought up the subject of an extension of exclusivity. Noh immediately asked if that was an official request.

“I could make it an official request,” I replied. Noh asked his staff to note down the request and asked me to send it to him in writing.

Noh's body language telegraphed that he had been trying to use the pending expiration of exclusivity as leverage against us, to force us to accept his proposal. He probably had expected us to capitulate right before the expiration. For that reason, I thought there was no way he would want to extend the exclusivity for us.

That was as far as we got with Noh on that day. I sent him a request for an extension of exclusivity for 10 days, to agree on major terms to be incorporated into a new MOU, followed by three weeks for the documentation and to close “as soon as practicable.”

Then we waited.

Our exclusive right to negotiate with the Korean government for KFB expired at midnight on May 2, 1999, with no word from the government. By the following morning we still had not heard from them one way or another. I filed an update to Blum, Bonderman, and the team noting our lack of progress. But just before I sent out the update, I received a letter from the FSC. After reading it, I added a paragraph at the beginning of my note: “I received the official letter from the FSC rejecting our request for extension of exclusivity. They say they will continue to discuss with us on a non-exclusive basis until May 12.”
