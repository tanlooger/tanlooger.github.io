title: 9 Daewoo Crisis
---






The FSC was clearly stalling us, and we didn't know why. We attributed it to a change of heart on their side, or the loss of political will. All of our internal discussions were focused on finding ways to push the government forward on our deal. Had we known what was really behind the delay, we might have taken a different tack.

The crisis at Daewoo, it turned out, was starting to look worse than the FSC had feared. But until it knew just how bad it was, it did not want to finalize the deal for Korea First Bank. KFB was the chaebol's main creditor, and there was no way to gauge the delinquency level of its loan book without resolving the Daewoo scandal first. Chairman Lee, I discovered much later, was intent on stalling until the Daewoo exposure was fully revealed.

In addition, the chairman had made a personal request to Seung-won Han, the chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea, to conduct a full audit of the FSC's restructuring efforts. “It was probably the first time that the head of a government body had requested to be audited,” he recalled later in his memoirs. But

the crisis called for special measures. The decisions that we made now under crisis conditions should not be evaluated later under a new post-recovery set of standards. History can be unkind once the market recovers, so I wanted a fair evaluation before it was too late and stale.



Had I known this at the time, I would have found Chairman Lee's attitude understandable and, in fact, quite far-sighted. History, no doubt, is full of actors who were crucified by later commentators, second-guessing their decisions in the moment. But I had no idea. Had Chairman Lee or anyone on the government side explained to us that they needed time to work out the Daewoo debacle or to complete the special audit, we would have understood and we would have waited more patiently.

But the FSC kept us in the dark, leaving us wondering if it had changed its mind. Consequently, we spent much time and energy coming up with different ways to push them along. Sometimes our tactics were effective; at other times they backfired. In the end, both sides were frustrated.

* * *

On July 22, all hell broke loose. Again.

To keep Tall Guy and Short Guy up to date with the latest developments in our negotiations, my colleague Paul Chen had drafted a confidential briefing memorandum outlining our current negotiating position and how we saw various scenarios playing out. The memo had three parts. The first part provided the background of the latest negotiations, clarifying the agreement we'd reached with Chairman Lee on July 2, describing how Noh had stalled the transaction, and concluding by noting that Lee was now personally involved in discussions and had reached agreement with Newbridge on most major issues.

The second part of the memorandum laid out the recent issues raised by the FSC team and described our less-than-favorable response. “The FSC's working team has been unable even to agree to proposals that the working team itself made, has raised some 30 new issues in the last few weeks after more than six months of negotiations and seems to be unable or unwilling to bring this matter to conclusion,” a particularly direct passage read.

The third part discussed potential “consequences of a collapsed deal,” which included embarrassment for President Kim, loss of opportunity for South Korea, the potential collapse of KFB, and the negative repercussions for South Korea in the international community.

We expected this memo would be used by our advisors as background information and possible talking points when they met with various constituencies. It was unaddressed and unsigned, and was not meant for outside consumption. Unfortunately, our advisors must have accidentally left a copy of the memo behind after a meeting, and, the next thing we knew, it was leaked to a Korean newspaper, which sensationally reported it as Newbridge's “ultimatum” to the government.

The leak caused an uproar. The “threatening document,” as the Daehan Mail called it, allegedly insinuated that “unless KFB is sold, negative effects on Korea's credit rating and the Korean government's structural adjustment are inevitable.”

Understandably, Chairman Lee and others at the FSC were upset. Apparently, they suspected that we'd leaked the document in a bid to improve our bargaining position. I moved to send out a statement of clarification to the press. Usually, we would go through the public relations department at KFB. But this time, KFB executives refused to help us, presumably because they were upset as well. We had to fax our statement to the Korean newspapers by ourselves.

The memo debacle had suddenly put us on the defensive. Our advisors and the FSC's advisors at Morgan Stanley urged us to write a letter to Chairman Lee explaining the leak. Frustratingly, there was nothing wrong with the memorandum itself; every word in it was correct and accurate. But when presented as an attempt to strong-arm the government, it sounded different, and the coverage touched a raw patriotic nerve among the Korean public. As a result, our negotiations stopped.

Following the advice of Ambassador Hyun, we sent a letter signed by Blum and Bonderman to Chairman Lee, expressing our regret and reassuring him of our commitment to the KFB transaction. “We share your exasperation with reports last week in the Korean media regarding a memorandum on the KFB transaction,” the letter read. “The document was not authorized by us and we regret the misunderstanding and confusion it has caused. As stated in Weijian Shan's correspondence with you, we can assure you that Newbridge has always and will continue to negotiate this transaction in good faith.”

The letter aimed to quash the market speculation that Newbridge might be having second thoughts because of KFB's large exposure to the troubled Daewoo Group. “While Daewoo's difficulties serve to highlight the potential risks inherent in the acquisition of KFB,” it went on to say, “we wish to assure you that Newbridge remains committed to completing the proposed transaction.”

We hoped that the letter would mollify the FSC somewhat, but we also urgently needed to get moving on the deal. It did not seem likely. Chairman Lee was due to go on holiday the following week. After that, the Newbridge leadership was scheduled to go to Aspen, Colorado, for a two-week conference. “I suppose the term sheet may not get signed until possibly September,” I noted in a memo of mine. “A very depressing thought.”

What we hadn't anticipated was that the FSC would react by telling the press about Blum and Bonderman's letter or that they would describe it as a “letter of apology.” This would be interpreted as a tacit admission that we had indeed sent them an ultimatum. While we badly wanted this episode to pass and be forgotten, we could not let it stand that we apologized for something we did not do. In particular, I was concerned that the FSC would use this as an excuse to back away from the deal.

I sent a letter to Ambassador Hyun on July 29 to express my frustration and to seek his advice. “Some Korean reporter called me to tell me that they heard from the FSC that Newbridge had sent an apology letter to Chairman Lee,” I began. “Needless to say, this is quite disturbing.” “We sent the letter,” I said, “in the belief that it would calm down Chairman Lee and in the hope that both sides would forget about this so we could concentrate on closing the deal, not to give the FSC an excuse not to do a deal.”

* * *

Meanwhile, the reports we were hearing about the situation at Daewoo were getting worse and worse. On July 28, Standard & Poor's downgraded Daewoo's debt from B– to CCC, reflecting deteriorating investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the FSC was asking the chaebol's foreign creditors, in addition to its domestic ones, to roll over their loans to the struggling firm. Daewoo at this point needed an emergency extension on more than 20 trillion won ($16.7 billion) of debt maturing that year and 4 trillion won ($3.3 billion) of new capital to avoid collapse. It was becoming clear that Chairman Lee was completely preoccupied by Daewoo. We learned that the FSC negotiating team had prepared a final position paper for the KFB deal and was recommending to Lee that these positions be given to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. However, the next time Ambassador Hyun spoke with Lee, Lee said that he needed to mull over the internal report for a couple of days. He also said that he would not accept his team's take-it-or-leave-it recommendation, which was good news. But it still left us waiting on the chairman. The FSC team could not make any move without his leadership.

It seemed that the chairman wanted to keep us warm by getting the FSC's advisors to deal with us instead. On July 30, Lee instructed Morgan Stanley to meet with us to “clarify the remaining issues.” However, it quickly became clear that the bankers were not authorized to do anything other than understand open issues; there was no movement forward.

We also heard that a stock offering by another Korean bank, Hanvit Bank, the second-largest bank in Korea, had collapsed due to lack of investor interest. Our advisors at Lehman Brothers had also been working on the Hanvit offering. That news was quite relevant to our KFB deal. The sale was to be a test of investor confidence in the Korean banking industry, and it revealed that investor interest was flagging. Combined with the Daewoo debt crisis, the Hanvit collapse raised questions about the firmness of Korea's economic recovery.

What was bad for Hanvit helped us, however. If its attempt to raise $1 billion of new capital had been successful, it might have made it more difficult for the FSC to agree to our terms. Its failure might have breathed new life into the FSC's interest in our transaction.

Through other channels, we were hearing optimistic reports on our deal's progress. One of Tall Guy's contacts had a meeting with Director General Noh, who informed him that the deal was pretty much done. And an article summarizing all the events since the “threatening document” in the Daehan Mail concluded by saying that the “incident was resolved” between Newbridge and the government and that “all agree that the negotiation will soon conclude.”

Despite the rife speculation, I was not optimistic. We had been in similar positions many times before, and I couldn't see how this would end any differently.

* * *

As the summer wore on, Seoul got hotter and steamier by the day. Yet the deal seemed relegated to the deep freeze by the FSC. Lee was scheduled to go on vacation on August 1. The Newbridge team was heading to Aspen for its offsite meeting for about two weeks. As it seemed the FSC was not talking to us anymore, there was no reason for us not to go. The prospect of a deal any time soon looked remote.

I left for Toronto on Monday, August 2, to meet with my family, whom I had not seen in two months. We were all going to Aspen for the Newbridge meeting, and I was looking forward to being together as a family.

As soon as I got into Toronto, I learned that Chairman Lee was still tied up with the Daewoo situation. He was also heard complaining about Morgan Stanley not doing its job. Harrison Young, the Hong Kong–based managing director who had been deeply involved in the early stages of the sale process, apparently got a dressing-down from the chairman. The chairman requested that Morgan Stanley analyze the remaining issues and prepare a report to the FSC by August 5 or 6.

The next day, we learned that Chairman Lee had postponed his vacation, which we took as an encouraging sign. Through our Kim & Chang lawyers, Lee specifically raised five issues pertaining to the transaction.

The first issue concerned the put right. While the MOU provided Newbridge with an unlimited put right to transfer bad assets to the government pre-close, Lee now took the stance that Newbridge should not be afforded such a right. He claimed that buyers in typical mergers and acquisitions assume all the assets of the acquired company. Lee indicated that he would allow Newbridge some latitude in asset selection, presenting this as a “concession” rather than as something that the government had already agreed to. Ambassador Hyun assumed that the parameters surrounding the selection would be far more stringent than what the chairman had agreed to regarding asset selection in our July 12 meeting. I asked Hyun to send Lee another copy of my note from that meeting, which I had read to the chairman, who had signed off on it.

The second issue concerned risk weighting and the government's guarantee of KFB's loans. This determined how much capital KFB would need to hold in order to offset the risk posed by its loans. Rules established by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) required that a bank maintain a certain amount of capital against its loan book, expressed as a percentage called a capital adequacy ratio or BIS ratio. For example, if the capital adequacy ratio was 10 percent, a bank would need to have at least $100 of capital on hand for every $1,000 worth of loan. This could be adjusted by risk weight. Naturally, the riskier the asset, the higher the risk weight and capital requirement. If a bank set the risk weight of a loan at 100 percent, it would need to hold the full $100 in capital. If it judged the loan to be less risky, it could set the risk weighting lower; a risk weighting of 80 percent would require the bank to hold $80 in capital.

Typically, local-currency government debt was considered to carry zero risk weight. The rationale behind this was that the government could always print money, so the chances of a default were assumed to be zero. Despite this, Chairman Lee wanted us to apply normal risk weighting to these loans, meaning that he wanted us to assign full risk-weight to KFB's loans, treating them as if they were not guaranteed by the government. This meant we would have to put more capital into the bank to be capital adequate even though capital against zero-risk assets, such as those fully guaranteed by the government, is not necessary.

I didn't think the chairman was unreasonable on this point. A regulator always wants more capital in a bank, not less, because it makes the bank safer. It also would bring more capital into the country, which was another benefit from the chairman's perspective. From our point of view, the more overcapitalized the bank, the lower our expected return on investment, but this wasn't a major issue for Newbridge. We had already agreed to invest 500 billion won into the bank, which would give the bank a capital adequacy ratio of no less than 10 percent, which was a full 2 percentage points higher than the 8 percent BIS requirement at the time, even after assigning a full risk weight to the government-guaranteed loans. Chairman Lee's emphasis on this point underscored his political concern that Newbridge should not be perceived as unduly benefitting from government assistance. I was optimistic that we would be able to easily come to an agreement on this point, based on what had already been negotiated.

Chairman Lee's third point of concern regarded KFB's staff headcount. Lee indicated that any employee reductions should be completed prior to closing to avoid further political fallout after the close. Lee also implied that no indemnification would be provided post-close for actions associated with layoffs. This was a more difficult gap to bridge. We could not rule out a voluntary workforce reduction program that would occur after closing. Such an action could be necessary to give new management the opportunity to carefully evaluate employees and terminate any low performers or redundant positions. Since staff redundancy, the extent to which we had not yet fully identified, was a legacy problem, we wanted the government to indemnify us against the costs and risks associated with cutting laden redundancies. Regardless of the timing of any such action, indemnification would be necessary to address any lawsuits or other liabilities that would arise from potential staff reductions.

The fourth issue Lee raised concerned the government's upside. Lee's comments to Hyun indicated that he needed to be able to explain to the public how the government would benefit from our deal. Lee was vague about what exactly he wanted on this issue, but I made it clear to Hyun that we were not open to renegotiating the price again. If that was the chairman's intention, Newbridge had to be prepared to walk away from the deal.

Lee's final issue concerned a request for the government to have the option to buy any loan if any disagreement about its provisioning arose. Since provisions for a loan would be determined by the management under Newbridge's control but would be paid for by the government, Lee wanted the government to have the option to simply buy the loan at book value plus accrued interest, instead of paying the provision, regardless of whether the loan was still under the government's guarantee. Previously, we had agreed that if the government did not agree to the provisioning determined by management, the dispute would be submitted to a third party for adjudication. Now Lee wanted to have the option to buy the loan if the government did not like the adjudication result. I thought the government should have the right either to ask for adjudication, the results of which would be binding on both parties, or to buy any loan under dispute, but not to have both rights, because it would be unfair for one party to an adjudication process not to be bound by the results—then what would be the point of adjudication?

Lee did not specifically address any of the other open issues, which meant that even once they were negotiated other sticking points would remain. It was especially frustrating to me that he seemed to ignore the agreements he and I had reached in July, which we had asked to be the starting point for future discussion. It felt like we were going in circles, rehashing topics that had already been resolved—in some cases more than once. It was also difficult to tell how seriously to take Lee's remarks because he supposedly had not had time to review his team's report and was still waiting to hear from Morgan Stanley. It was possible—if not likely—that this list would change again after Lee had consulted Morgan Stanley.

Chairman Lee discussed with our K&C advisors how negotiations were to proceed. First, he would review all the information, including the recommendations of the FSC working team, then he would ask us for comments. Around Wednesday, August 11, he would likely make a final decision on whatever issues remained open. Our window to get the deal done would be between August 11 and August 20. After that, Lee would be involved in the implementation of a new restructuring plan for Daewoo so he would not have much time for anything else.

I wasn't sure if I should take all the feedback at face value. Lee's actions seemed consistent with intelligence from Short Guy that the FSC chairman was trying to stonewall the deal. According to Short Guy, Lee believed that KFB would be able to recover on its own and therefore should not be sold to Newbridge. But with the Blue House still in favor of the deal, Lee was attempting to stall. He had already asked President DJ Kim for three additional months to conclude negotiations, trying to buy as much time as possible for KFB to show improvement in its performance. If and when that happened, Lee could then try to convince the president that KFB should not be sold.

Chen and I outlined our own plan to move things forward. We thought we could use the slowdown to our advantage if, in our public communication strategy, we shaped our deal's success as a sign of confidence in Korea's reform policies and economy. Daewoo's plight had been a major setback in the nation's recovery, which put us back in a situation similar to when we negotiated the original MOU. Korea badly needed the endorsement of a foreign investor.

We considered pointing out that the collapse of our transaction at the height of Daewoo's problems could badly damage the already fragile investor confidence toward Korea, cast further doubt on whether Daewoo would survive any restructuring efforts, and result in a run on the stock market that could cause irreparable damage. Chen and I drafted a memo to Blum and Bonderman and proposed that over the next few days, our political advisors should communicate this to their contacts in the National Assembly, Blue House, and elsewhere to continue to pressure Lee to complete the deal on our terms.

Bonderman responded the next day and agreed. It was clear that he and Blum were frustrated with the constant stalling and had run out of patience with Chairman Lee. They were prepared to take a hard line and be clear that “if the deal isn't done by August 20 we will take whatever actions we think appropriate.”

* * *

Working through backchannels, Short Guy had been in touch with a Mr. Kwoon, who was said to be a close political advisor to President DJ Kim. On August 4, an opportunity arose. Our political advisors wrote to say that the president had instructed Kwoon to meet with Short Guy and me to discuss our deal's outstanding issues and resolve them as quickly as possible. When I questioned how we could conclude the transaction without Chairman Lee's involvement, Kwoon had relayed a message to me through Short Guy: “Internal Korean matters are of no concern to you. We are discussing the matter with Chairman Lee.”

Short Guy advised that if we wanted him to meet with Kwoon, we should let him know immediately. “At this point I have no opinion on the matter than to agree with David Bonderman's memo that if this transaction is to be completed, it will only be done with direct involvement from the Blue House,” he wrote. “I would not venture to guess at this late date whether we will be successful or not but should Newbridge be willing to pursue this opportunity I would make myself available to arrive in Seoul on Monday.”

Short Guy's memo was followed by another almost immediately, this one with the subject “Dick Blum Conversation.” It read as follows:

Subsequent to drafting my memo to you I received a call from Dick Blum. He expressed his feeling that a meeting with Mr. Kwoon should not be accepted without confirmation that Mr. Kwoon is authorized to speak about the KFB transaction by the President.

He also believes that the proposed meeting should be discussed with Ambassador Hyun and that Chairman Lee's acceptance of our discussing the transaction with Mr. Kwoon be obtained.

Following Dick's instruction, I will ask Mr. Kwoon for his bona fides from the President. It may or may not end discussions through this channel. You know well the Korean mentality.



Blum was the most politically astute, sensitive, and cautious among us, and he had an unerring knack for keeping us out of trouble. Obviously, if whatever we or our advisors did was authorized by the president, we could do no wrong, but sometimes it was difficult to tell if our political advisors were speaking with authorized people. Many people claimed to have the ear of the president or to have influence over the government's decision making. With the exception of Chairman Lee, it was very difficult for us to tell who in the government could or could not make a difference in our situation. The memory of the leak of our confidential briefing memo was still fresh. While we wanted to put pressure on Chairman Lee to act, we did not want to antagonize the FSC, which was both our counterparty for the transaction and our partner if the deal got done.

* * *

Things went quiet for about 10 days, while Chairman Lee was on vacation and we were all in Aspen for internal meetings. A number of my colleagues at TPG questioned why we had not walked away from the KFB deal when it appeared to be a hopeless situation. Many thought we were wasting our time. Indeed, the opportunity costs were rising; each day we spent waiting for the KFB deal to happen was a day we could not spend on some other transactions elsewhere. I was not ready to give up in spite of the skepticism, including my own. I thought if there was any hope at all, we should persevere.

Dan Carroll was more sanguine about it. He said that, considering all the dramatic ups and downs, twists and turns in the deal process, “at least we have earned the right to make a movie out of it.”

* * *

My family and I returned to Hong Kong on Saturday, August 15. The next day, I received a fax from Ambassador Hyun, who had apparently been trying to track me down since I'd left Aspen. The memo was rather formal and was signed simply “Kim & Chang,” as was customary for formal correspondence from the firm. I read it eagerly since I had not heard anything from the battlefront in nearly two weeks.

In a fairly roundabout way, the memo informed me that the timeline for our deal conclusion would likely be pushed back again, this time by a week and a half. Chairman Lee had been called to appear before various committees of the National Assembly to answer questions on the Daewoo crisis, and the coming week was already filling up with Daewoo-related meetings and conferences, including a public announcement that the chaebol had reached a restructuring agreement on its debt.

Chairman Lee, the memo continued, also wanted to make sure we were taking the five points he had raised on August 2 seriously. “Chairman Lee requested that we convey his wish that Newbridge give serious thought to these issues, as he explained that it would put him in a difficult political position with the public and other interested parties in Korea if his concerns are not resolved.”

* * *

Ambassador Hyun had been accurate in his reading of the demands of the Daewoo situation. Lee had a full plate. The news was making headlines far beyond Korea. Even Hong Kong's newspapers carried stories of the Korean government's financial and political woes. For example, on August 16, the AFP, a global press agency, ran multiple stories on the latest news out of Seoul, including headlines “Seoul to sink US$8.3 billion into financial markets,” “Final talks on sell-off details, Daewoo set to announce restructure,” “Samsung seeks dialogue as it urges creditors to delay sanctions,” and “Battling President vows to stamp out graft.”

That same day, I received a fax from Jihong Kim in Seoul. His take on the situation was that President DJ Kim was still in our corner. While the Daewoo issues were getting the most attention, recent articles seemed to indicate increasing concern about the slow process of selling KFB and Seoul Bank. During one meeting with a junior official at the Blue House, Jihong was told that the Blue House wanted to close the deals for both banks. Jihong wrote that the official “personally believes the gap between Newbridge and the FSC is very narrow, and a senior level meeting is necessary.”

Through our conversations with various contacts we also learned quite a bit about what was going on behind the scenes. A Korea Times reporter told me that Chairman Lee was seen to be the root of many problems, including the Daewoo crisis, and would likely be removed from his position before the end of the year. I confided in him that we were running out of patience, but he encouraged us to stay the course because the Blue House was still very serious about the deal.

While some of these developments seemed to be in our favor, the Korean economy improved slightly as the Daewoo situation seemed to come under control. Bank of Korea reported Korea’s GDP quarterly growth of 9.8 percent, which I supposed would make the Koreans less willing to compromise to sign a deal for our takeover of KFB. Other deals like ours were also struggling. A recent bid by Carlyle Group and AIG for Korea Life Insurance fell through after the seller insisted on changing the price, despite having signed a binding MOU. It seemed that everyone was having similar experiences to Newbridge's.

Now we were just waiting for the FSC to reengage with us when it was willing and ready. I returned home to Hong Kong late on Saturday, August 21, to find a voice message from Ambassador Hyun. I returned his call the next morning. He opened with “Lee appears serious about doing a deal.” But, he added, since the economic and political conditions had changed, if we still wanted to do a deal, several deal terms had to change. Hyun proposed flying to Hong Kong or San Francisco to have a conversation with Blum and Bonderman.

The last time Hyun had suggested a face-to-face meeting like this had resulted in our June 8 meeting with Chairman Lee in Hong Kong, when we'd come close to what we had thought was a breakthrough. Now, with far fewer issues to resolve, all we needed was Lee's political will to ink the deal. It felt as if we were on the brink of a final agreement—and the anticipation filled me with excitement. I also wondered if Hyun had told me everything he knew, or if there was something he wanted to tell me, Blum, and Bonderman all at the same time.

I immediately agreed that he would fly to Hong Kong the next day to meet with me in person and then have a phone call with Blum and Bonderman.
