title: 6 The Ambassador
---






Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is situated slightly south of the dividing line between North and South Korea in the middle of the Korean Peninsula and at about the same latitude as Tokyo, Athens, and Richmond, Virginia, in the United States. May is probably the most pleasant month of the year in the South Korean capital. April is still somewhat chilly, and by June the city starts to bake in the still heat of summer. It rarely rains. All the trees are fully dressed in new green leaves that seem to be polished with wax and glitter in the sunlight.

The Newbridge team had made Seoul's Shilla Hotel home. It was there that we stayed each time we visited Seoul. The Shilla was perched at the top of a long driveway right up against one of the many hills surrounding central Seoul, this one called Namsan, or South Mountain. Its main building was a slab of reddish-brown brick, about 20 stories tall. The hotel itself was rather old, and its age was starting to show. In the back of the hotel were the remains of Seoul's old city wall. It was connected to a historic guesthouse, an old government building in the Chinese style, where generations of Korean leaders had entertained foreign dignitaries. Over the main door hung a plaque with three big Chinese characters: “Welcome Guest House.” In between this building and the hotel was a large lawn that I could see from my room. There was a wedding on the lawn almost every weekend in May.

Being able to read Chinese gave me a greater appreciation of Korea's history. Many historical sites, including palaces, temples, pavilions, and museums, used Chinese characters, as did some of the streets. Chinese characters were called hanja in Korean (just as they are called kanji in Japan) and had probably been introduced to Korea more than 2,000 years ago, at the time when the Qin dynasty unified China and the defeated rulers of the north who had lost their kingdoms fled to Korea. Chinese characters were the only written language in Korea until the 15th century, when King Sejong the Great and his scholars developed an alphabetic writing system known as hangul. In the 1970s President Chung-hee Park largely banned the use of hanja, promoting hangul instead. When I first visited Korea in the late 1980s, many street signs were still in hanja. Today the characters have largely disappeared, except for most Korean names, which are still written in hanja. Many among the older generation of Koreans are still well versed in Chinese characters and can write in Chinese calligraphy.

As a runner, I liked running in the pleasant May weather along the mountain path zigzagging all the way to the peak of Namsan, where Seoul Tower stands. From there I could enjoy a panoramic view of the sprawling city. Cutting through the city like a shining belt is Han'gang, the Han River.

The FSC announced to the world on Monday, May 3, that it would continue to negotiate the sale of KFB with Newbridge until May 12, but on a nonexclusive basis. I dispatched a memo by fax from Hong Kong on Sunday, May 7, 1999, with the subject “Safe—Towards Another Deadline.” The project codename was still “Safe,” although at that point the deal looked anything but.

Despite assurances from Tall Guy and Short Guy, I wrote, I still didn't see any sign of flexibility across the table. Although the other side now seemed more willing to meet with us than it had over the past two months, there was no change in their position on major terms.

“Given the large gap between us,” I concluded, “I cannot see how the two sides can suddenly agree to a deal on so many major open issues at the eleventh hour. I am afraid that even though the other side wants to do a deal with us, it may continue to expect us to accept its deal, which is not acceptable to us.”

At 10:30 in the morning on May 11, one day before the government's new self-imposed deadline, we had a last-ditch meeting with the FSC team at their office to hear their feedback on our proposal. Noh came into the meeting only ceremonially, for about five minutes, and then left. Without making any comments on our proposal, the FSC team insisted we should give them a new proposal.

Mike O'Hanlon of Lehman, whom I asked at that point to lead some negotiation sessions, was an infinitely patient man. “Shan, please don't ever take it personally,” he counseled me, after one particularly frustrating negotiating session. “It's just a deal.” His patience, I thought, was our best weapon against the other side's maddening and seemingly endless quibbles on every issue.

But now even O'Hanlon seemed to have had enough. “Please don't view yourselves as regulators. This is a commercial negotiation,” he told the FSC negotiators. Bob Barnum, another member of the Newbridge team, asked whether it was the economics or the structure of the deal that was not acceptable. The reply was: “Newbridge's proposal is not acceptable. Come back with a better proposal.”

The Newbridge team regrouped in a conference room at the Shilla Hotel's business center to discuss how to respond to the government's request. Short Guy came in to tell us, once again, that the deal was done, no problem, and all we had to do was submit our best proposal to the other side. Incidentally, a few people, including a Korea Times reporter, called to congratulate me, saying that a local newswire had just reported that the KFB deal was Newbridge's to clinch, and the government was only making a last-ditch effort to improve the terms.

I found all this hard to believe. It was as if I had gone out for a date with a girl who refused to talk to me and slapped my face, only to be told by friends, when I returned home, that she was ready to marry me. How was that possible?

We all felt that we had spent the past four months negotiating against ourselves, submitting proposal after proposal at the government's urging, undercutting our own terms at their every request.

That afternoon we made a bold decision, hoping to drastically change the course of negotiations. We decided to take a new tack, proposing to use a covered assets model, which we had considered earlier but never proposed. We hoped using such a model would eliminate the two key issues: the valuation mark on the loan portfolio and the methodology used to classify troubled loans when deciding which would be put to the bad bank.

Under the covered assets model, Newbridge would eliminate any puts of loans to the government. Instead, we proposed a five-year, yield-maintenance agreement for all of KFB's loans. In other words, we would accept a guarantee from the government of the principal and interest of the loans. After the five years were up, KFB would give the government a price at which it would buy any classified loan at that time. The government could either accept the price and pay KFB the difference between the price and book value, or buy the loan outright at book value.

We liked this model for a couple reasons. To start with, we would avoid sending a negative signal regarding any company whose loans were being put to the bad bank. For another, except for the initial transfer of nonperforming loans, all other loans would be kept. This avoided the need for loans to be marked to market.

At the end of the five-year period, impaired loans would be classified according to the then-prevailing standard adopted by the Financial Supervisory Services of Korea rather than international best practices. (We expected that by that time the Korean standard would converge with international best practices anyhow.) The government would then have two options. If it agreed to the impairment value as determined by KFB, it would pay KFB the impaired amount. If the government did not agree (i.e., if it determined the impairment was smaller than what was assessed by KFB), it could buy the loan at the original book value and sell it in the market, hopefully at a price better than what KFB valued it at. The government would thus be protected against any possibility that KFB would undervalue the loans, since it had the option of taking or leaving our price. Under this arrangement KFB would have no incentive to undervalue a loan, because it would risk losing a customer if the government decided to purchase the loan; neither would it overvalue a loan, because it would then make a loss.

The arrangement could also work in reverse. In this scenario the government could name the loan value, and KFB would have the option to either accept it or to sell the loan to the government at the original book value. Again, each party would be protected against any opportunistic behavior of the other.

We called this a buy/sell arrangement, which is typically used to dissolve a joint venture. Suppose two parties jointly own a property but they wish to terminate the joint ownership. Which one of them should be the buyer and at what price? In a typical buy/sell arrangement, one party names the price, while the other party has the right to either buy or sell at that price. It does not matter which party names the price because the other party has the option to either buy or sell, depending on if the party thinks the price is lower or higher than fair market value. This is probably the best way to find the fair market value. For our purposes, the buy/sell arrangement would eliminate any need to value the loans at the present time, thus removing what had been a major point of contention between the FSC and Newbridge.

Our new proposal attempted to address the concerns of the government without making things riskier for KFB. The government feared that we would not roll over loans at maturity and that we would use the put right to transfer those loans to the government. As we knew, many of KFB's borrowers used short-term loans for long-term projects, because the old practice of Korean banks was simply to roll over these loans upon maturity. If these loans were not rolled over, the borrowers might default, which would trigger our right to put the loan. Under the new proposal, KFB would generally roll over such loans, because they were guaranteed by the government. By rolling over the loans almost automatically upon maturity within five years, we also would take care of another concern of the government: that KFB would send a negative signal to the market about the borrower if its loan was put.

The ingenuity of the proposal was that both the government and Newbridge would be better off with it, because it would be less risky for both sides. As the buyer of the bank, we were concerned about the potential deepening of the economic crisis, which might render even good borrowers bad in the future. Therefore, we would need to value current loans conservatively. The government, meanwhile, was hoping that the economy would recover and the loan would be worth more tomorrow than it was today, so it would be opposed to valuing loans conservatively at the present time. With completely divergent expectations, the two sides could not hope to reach an agreement. Our new proposal eliminated the need to put a value on the loans at the present time. It gave KFB borrowers five years to recover from the economic crisis and improve their financial health. If they did so, loans would be worth more, which would be beneficial both to the government, which provided the guarantee, and to KFB, which would have retained good customers. It is rare for a new proposal to be better than the old for both sides. We thought ours was. I just hoped that the FSC team saw it that way as well.

We went back to the FSC at about 6:30 that evening, May 11. O'Hanlon took the lead, carefully explaining the new proposal. The FSC team looked stunned. They raised a few questions, then said they would study it. Gokul Laroia of Morgan Stanley called later to ask a few follow-up questions. My hopes rose that the government team was receptive to the concept, if not the proposal, as yet.

That evening Dick Blum arrived in Seoul on his private plane. The purpose of his visit, arranged by our political advisors, was to meet with a Woon-ji Choi the next day. Choi was said to be affiliated with United Liberal Democrats, to be the treasurer of the three political parties that formed the coalition government, and, critically, to be FSC chairman Hun-jai Lee's mentor. Short Guy and Tall Guy told us that Choi would meet with Blum and bring Chairman Lee to the meeting. During the meeting Lee would apologize to Blum for being rude during their last meeting back in April. Then the deal would be struck.

The next day, May 12, all of us waited for confirmation of a meeting time between Blum and Choi, but the morning passed without word from our advisors. By then we knew that Tall Guy and Short Guy worked in secrecy, so we waited patiently. Finally Blum and Carroll went to KFB to pay a courtesy visit to Chairman Ryoo. At about 2 pm Short Guy and his Korean friends told us that Blum was requested to call Mr. Noh, who was waiting for the call.

Blum dialed the number, but the man who answered had no clue who Blum was or where to find Noh. In his exasperation, Blum said over the speakerphone, “All the big shots are here waiting.” The man on the other end of the line did not know what Blum was talking about, but he politely replied, in poor English, “I know you are a big shot.” All of us who were sitting around the speakerphone had to cover our mouths with our hands to muffle our laughs.

When I finally tracked down Noh, he was not expecting a call from Blum. The men spoke for no more than three minutes, and Noh said only that the FSC was still studying the new proposal. Despite all that, our political advisors insisted that the deal would be done by midnight.

Earlier in the day Yonhap, a Korean news service that was practically a government mouthpiece, reported that Newbridge had made a new proposal that the FSC was studying. “The new terms are expected to hold many traps,” it helpfully explained, citing unnamed government sources. We did not have to guess who had planted the story.

Another newspaper, Munhwa, had run with the headline “Newbridge/KFB Deal Completed—Government Decides to Bear 4.5 Trillion Won.” According to that article, the contract would be signed at 12 noon and announced in the evening, but the parties were still negotiating, because, it reported, the government was concerned about its sovereign credit rating. How a deal that helped the country's sovereign rating should be a source of concern was not explained in the article. This report was eerily similar to the story told to us by our advisors, and I suspected that someone involved in their circle was behind it.

It seemed that many people knew better about the prospects for our deal than we did ourselves. I had stopped trying to handicap the various outcomes. In the end, the May 12 deadline passed without further contact between the FSC team and ourselves, other than that three-minute call between Blum and Noh.

At 4 pm on May 12 Blum left Seoul to return to San Francisco, having spent less than 24 hours on the ground. He hadn't had the promised meeting with Mr. Choi and Chairman Lee and had had only a three-minute call with Noh. What a waste of time.

Already skeptical about the repeated assurances given to us by Short Guy and Tall Guy that the deal was done, I was curious to hear their explanation as to what had happened. They had one. They said that the political opposition had mounted a counterattack on the night of May 11 and turned the tables on the deal. The opposition, they said, was led by none other than Woo-choong Kim, the chairman of Daewoo. He opposed to the deal, they claimed, because KFB was Daewoo's lead bank, and he was concerned that foreign owners would be less inclined to do Daewoo's bidding.

I was certain that if Chairman Kim had understood our deal, he would not have opposed it. Our new proposal to the government was intended to preserve customer relationships by giving customers time to recover from the current financial malaise. I decided to pay him a visit to explain the situation. Regardless of whether the rumors were true, it was prudent to win such a powerful and influential chaebol head to our side.

Luckily, I knew Chairman Kim personally. Our relationship dated back to 1987, when he sought my advice while I was still a professor at Wharton, and was such that I could just pick up the phone and call him. We arranged to have lunch the following week, on May 18.

To prepare for the meeting, I wrote up a confidential memo that explained, in summary form, the key terms and major benefits of our new proposal. I had it translated into Korean, even though Chairman Kim spoke good English.

There was one element of our proposal I knew would be of interest to him. Under our new covered assets model, there would be no further transfer of loans after the close of our acquisition for at least five years. Borrowers like Daewoo would not have to worry about a disruption in their banking relationship with KFB.

I told Chairman Kim the deal would be a win-win and that we wanted our customers to succeed. If the deal fell apart, it would create a lose-lose outcome for all concerned.

Kim listened attentively. In front of me, he read our briefing memo carefully, twice. Then he said he would try to find out where things stood.

Coincidentally, Dick Fuld, chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers, was in town a few days later. He and Mike O'Hanlon were meeting with regulators and Lehman's major clients, including Chairman Lee of the FSC and Chairman Kim of Daewoo. O'Hanlon and I spent some time preparing a script for Fuld to use in his meetings concerning the KFB situation.

O'Hanlon returned to the hotel at about 6 pm, after having spent the day making the rounds with his CEO. He looked dejected. Chairman Lee had told Fuld that he was committed to the deal and that he remained positive about its prospects. But the main issue now, Lee said, was not price but the bank's management and customers. Fuld explained that the new management team identified by Newbridge was ready but, without a deal, it could not be moved into place. Further, he noted, the covered assets model in our latest proposal meant there would be no disruption of corporate client relationships for five years. It was clear to both O'Hanlon and Fuld that Chairman Lee knew nothing about this new proposal.

The meeting with Chairman Kim was even worse. Although I was under the impression that my meeting with him a few days earlier had been productive, the Daewoo chief bluntly told Fuld that he thought it was too late and that there was no hope to save our deal. O'Hanlon reported that Chairman Kim was so negative that he spoke of the deal in past tense.

The next morning Chairman Kim called to invite me to meet with him at the Hilton Hotel. The meeting was brief; he had only one message for me. He asked me to keep in contact with him directly, without the knowledge of any third party. He wanted to keep our communication strictly confidential. He said he was going to meet with Chairman Lee at 4 that afternoon.

I had heard from some Korean friends that Lee had once been Kim's chief of staff and therefore they knew each other well and had a good personal relationship. I took this as a positive sign.

At about 9 pm Chairman Kim called again, and I went to meet him at the Hilton. Chairman Lee was not negative about the deal, he said, but he was worried we'd get rid of half of KFB's customers. This feedback, consistent with what I'd heard from O'Hanlon, was further proof that Lee had zero knowledge of our new proposal. It became clear that Noh had never shared our proposal with his chairman, nor had he provided any feedback since we submitted it, more than a week earlier.

I suspected that one reason we had not heard from the FSC was because it was distracted, negotiating with HSBC for Seoul Bank. I had heard from Michael Schuman of the Wall Street Journal that the talks between the FSC and HSBC were moving ahead. If the FSC and HSBC struck a deal for the only other major bank up for sale, the government probably would not need Newbridge anymore. It could walk away and blame us for the deal's failure. Still, I found it hard to believe that things with HSBC could be progressing any better than they were with Newbridge. My suspicions were soon proven to be well founded.

“HSBC's deal has run into trouble,” Won-kyu Choi told me as soon as we sat down for lunch on May 20, the day after my private meeting with Chairman Kim. I had held Choi in high regard ever since he'd defied Noh by translating for me at our April press conference, and I found the KFB executive to be quite well informed on all that was going on surrounding the two bank deals.

HSBC had submitted a new proposal, Choi said, with a number of new demands. Many of these sounded familiar and had been in Newbridge's original discussions over KFB: using international best practices instead of Korean bank standards to classify troubled loans, for example, and marking down the value of the workout loans, as opposed to accepting them at book value. But supposedly HSBC had not included these terms in its MOU. Furthermore, HSBC wanted to value the office building of Seoul Bank at a steep two-thirds discount from its book value.

“The FSC team was shocked by HSBC's new proposal,” Choi told me. “In fact, they were flabbergasted. HSBC's terms are worse for the government than Newbridge's. Now the FSC doesn't know what to do with HSBC anymore.”

“Guess what?” Choi went on. “Now the FSC thinks Newbridge people aren't bad guys after all, because compared to HSBC, you guys have been up front and reasonable.”

I was glad to hear that the FSC team seemed to appreciate our honesty—finally—but I wasn't entirely surprised by these developments. It seemed inevitable that HSBC would have to change its terms from what it had negotiated under its MOU, unless it had calculated that the inevitable losses from keeping bad loans was the price it had to pay to acquire Seoul Bank. Even so, I doubted HSBC or anyone else would be willing to pay that sort of price. The economy was still so fragile that it was almost impossible to quantify how large the hidden losses might be.

It seemed that HSBC had taken the opposite approach to ours in negotiating with the Korean government. We'd put all our cards on the table negotiating the MOU. In subsequent negotiations, we never deviated from any of the agreed terms to ask for more. We only loosened our terms, making concessions. HSBC, by contrast, now seemed to be the ones demanding the Korean government make concessions.

Bankers are known to sometimes use the tactic of bait and switch or of trying to take a second bite of the apple. They justify it not as intentionally misleading but as a way to squeeze themselves in the door when the counterparty is more demanding than discerning. The approach is risky because it can backfire, and it requires a desperate counterparty that is willing to accept worsening terms. Those who fall for it once rarely will do so again.

We did not play that kind of game. Bait and switch made it impossible to build a long-term relationship. The only way to build trust, I still believe, is to be up front and honest, even if it means losing some opportunities. We earn our credibility in the long run.

I thought back to Noh's glee, celebrating the HSBC MOU he took credit for negotiating. In truth, he had been more than a little naïve. Anyone with experience would know that no investor in his right mind would offer to lose money before it could make money, as the terms of HSBC's MOU seemed to imply.

“Now the FSC doesn't know what to do,” Choi repeated. If what he was telling me was true, our chances had improved markedly. He also said that “DJ's men,” referring to those working with President Dae-jung Kim, were building pressure to push forward with banking reforms. He hoped that these powerful allies of the president could override the opposition and provide political cover for the FSC to do the deal.

“Unless the FSC has a good reason not to do the deal,” Choi told me, “DJ's men will prevail because the deal is in the national interest.”

“But what deal?” I asked. “I am not sure if the president's men even know what our new proposal is.”

Choi disagreed. “I think they know.”

He cited two articles in that day's newspapers which reflected frustration over the lack of progress with the KFB deal. Both articles were critical of the FSC. One questioned its competence. The other reported that KFB's employees were losing morale. It even quoted Choi himself as saying “Whenever there is talk of capital injection by the government, employees become concerned because they are regarded as takers of taxpayers' money. And the morale goes down.”

Choi concluded that he was confident in our eventual success, advising us to sit tight and wait for the FSC to show another card. His unwavering confidence in us and in our deal lifted my spirits.

Later that afternoon I received an invitation from Kevin Honan, the economic counselor at the U.S. Embassy, to visit him and Ben Fairfax, his boss. My colleague Daniel Poon joined me, and we briefed them on our new proposal. To my surprise, they seemed quite well informed of what was going on. They also told us that the U.S. ambassador, Steve Bosworth, took a keen interest in the deal, viewing it as a litmus test of South Korea's resolve to restructure its banking system. I did not know the source of their intelligence, but it hadn't come from Newbridge, as none of us had met with the U.S. diplomatic team before. It seemed that Choi was right again; the president's men were following the negotiations closely.

Before I left, Honan also shared with me a cartoon clipped from a local newspaper. It depicted an ugly girl sitting on the ground, crying, in the middle of a village. She was holding a traditional Korean fan labeled “KFB.” There were two ladies in traditional Korean costumes standing in the background chatting with each other. One says to the other, “They tried plastic surgery to marry her off quickly. …” The other woman replies, “I heard she needs another three trillion to finish the job!” At the right side of the frame, a woman, also in traditional Korean dress, chases after and tries to pull back a Western man with a briefcase labeled “Newbridge,” who is walking away with sweat dripping off his face. The thought bubble above his head reads “She doesn't look anything like her photos.” (See Exhibit 3.)

I had to admit the cartoon was pretty clever, and it suggested that the public sentiment was turning. Faced with the prospect of another 3-trillion-won bill to taxpayers, on top of the 2 to 3 trillion won previously, to keep the bank afloat, a deal with Newbridge was looking far preferable to no deal at all.

Even so, negotiations with the FSC had gone quiet. We had received no further word from the FSC negotiators after the May 12 deadline had expired. So, with nothing further to do in Seoul, Daniel Poon and I left the U.S. Embassy and headed for the airport to take the next flight back to Hong Kong.

As soon as I arrived home, I checked my voicemail and found a message from Jin Park, a lawyer from Kim & Chang, the Korean firm we had engaged soon after signing the MOU. He informed me that his senior partner, Ambassador Hong-choo Hyun, would like to get in contact with either Blum or Bonderman.

* * *

I had first heard of Ambassador Hyun over breakfast with a group of Kim & Chang lawyers more than a month earlier, when the deal seemed to be in peril. They told me about a senior partner at their firm who had been South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, and to the United States, in the early 1990s; he had been a National Assembly representative before that. Everyone referred to him as the ambassador. He was a highly respected figure in Korea, they told me, and suggested he would be a good addition to the K&C team to help communicate Newbridge's position to the top levels of the FSC.

I had met with Ambassador Hyun at Kim & Chang's offices in mid-April. In his late 50s, Hyun wore rimless glasses and a well-tailored suit. He had just enough gray in his hair to look distinguished. Smiling warmly, he greeted me with a firm handshake. He spoke fluent, indeed masterful, English, probably better than any Korean I had met. He had a slow, gentle style of speech, which gave one the impression that his every word was considered. He came across as an impeccably polished diplomat and gentleman, which he was.

The next day, on May 21, I followed up by phone with a Kim & Chang partner. He told me that the FSC was somehow still unclear as to Newbridge's current intent with regard to the KFB deal and Ambassador Hyun’s mission was to help us better communicate with the FSC.

Perhaps not so coincidentally, Gokul Laroia of Morgan Stanley called me that same afternoon.

“Shan, this is unofficial,” he said. He didn't know for certain, but he believed the FSC was preparing a counterproposal to our covered asset model to show us next week. However, he cautioned, the FSC team was still being unrealistic, so we should temper our expectations. “I hope they don't come up with something totally bizarre,” he said with a sigh.

Whether it was public sentiment, the HSBC deal going south, or pressure from “DJ's men,” something had changed on the FSC side. After a long silence, they were coming back to the table. But we had to remain cautious, I believed. The negotiations were not going to be any easier. As I related in a memo on the same day to prepare Blum and Bonderman for a visit by Ambassador Hyun:

It seems that the FSC now feels the pressure internally to do a deal with us. But they probably do not know what to propose. They want to get the best deal but they do not know where our limit is. We know they do not do the kind of analysis we do, and neither do they use their advisors. The only benchmark they go by is how far they can push, i.e., testing our limit. That is why they have consistently said no to whatever we have proposed so far…. Therefore, the only way for them to take our proposal seriously is for them to understand that we are already at or beyond our limit in terms of economics with our latest proposal. As long as they believe we can make further concessions in terms of economics, it is unlikely for them to accept anything we propose. This, unfortunately, is typical Korean brinkmanship negotiating style, as we have learned. Therefore, we need to be careful, holding firm our position while showing flexibility to accommodate the political and other sensitivities of the other side.



Bonderman responded via fax the same day:

Thanks for your memo of May 21 on negotiating strategy. I am in total agreement. Specifically, I think our position with Ambassador Hyun should be that, while we are always willing to move pieces around to help the FSC, our economic bottom line is exactly as set forth in our most recent proposal.



With that thought in mind, we were prepared to start talking with the Koreans again. It was time for Blum and Bonderman to meet the ambassador.
