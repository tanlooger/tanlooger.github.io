title: 2 Project Safe

The weather in New York City was pleasant and mild in the fall. Dan Carroll, my partner at Newbridge Capital, and I walked out of the Stanhope Hotel at about 8 am as the early morning sun shone warmly on my face. Our car waited for us at the curb, and behind it, Fifth Avenue was jammed with the usual rush-hour traffic.

It was September 1998. Newbridge was raising its second fund, and we were in New York City to visit various potential investors.

Once in the car, I opened a folder of faxes I had received overnight from our office in Hong Kong. One of them was sent by our colleague Paul Chen. In it there were two brief descriptions (teasers, as they were called in investment banking) for the sale of two major South Korean commercial banks that had failed and been nationalized by the government. Chen explained that the government of South Korea had engaged Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, to be its financial advisor to conduct an auction to sell off control of both banks.

The Asian Financial Crisis had hit South Korea hard. By the end of 1997, the country had been on the verge of defaulting on its sovereign debt. Money was fleeing the country, and its foreign exchange reserves had plummeted to just $8.9 billion by December, barely enough to last a week or two at the rate of capital flight. The stock market had plunged by 49 percent, and Korea's currency, the won, had depreciated by 65.9 percent against the U.S. dollar. The country came so close to default on its foreign debts that citizens were encouraged to sell their gold jewelry to the country's central bank to help replenish its foreign exchange reserves.

It was a humiliating experience for a proud country, one that had joined the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1996, the year before the crisis. It was only the second Asian nation after Japan to join the OECD, a clubby group of rich, developed nations. Until late 1997, South Korea had been one of Asia's remarkable success stories. The country epitomized the so-called Asian miracle. Once a war-ravaged, aid-dependent nation, it had transformed itself into a fast-growing, export-oriented economy. The Asian Financial Crisis threatened to wipe out nearly three and a half decades of hard work, leaving South Korea's 46 million citizens in financial ruin.

Part of the reason for Korea's success had been its banking system. Banks channeled funds to chaebols in industries like automobiles, iron and steel, shipbuilding, and petrochemicals, fueling their take-off. Chaebols are a uniquely Korean type of conglomerate controlled by wealthy families. They were favored by the government, which wanted to see them succeed, ostensibly for the benefit of the nation's economy. But there were risks that came from the government's playing favorites.

Political and personal connections, rather than business considerations, led banks to favor the government's picks when it came to lending. Export-oriented firms also had greater access to credit and lower borrowing costs than did firms that focused on the domestic market, allowing chaebols like Hyundai and Samsung, which had had great success selling products overseas, to use leverage, or borrowed money, to expand, while enjoying a protected domestic market. As a result, chaebols were highly leveraged, and there were few restrictions in place to prevent banks from concentrating their risks in a small number of corporate borrowers. Some banks lent up to 45 percent of their capital to a single borrower. Under Korean accounting rules, banks considered borrowers performing customers as long as they could make interest payments, regardless of whether they had any hope of paying off the principal.

President Chung-hee Park had nationalized all the banks when he came to power in 1961, and it was not until the mid-1980s that they were nominally put back in the hands of private management. Still, they functioned less as private companies and more as tools for national development. As such, their profitability was extremely low. A McKinsey study found that profitability among Korean banks, as measured by return on assets, was just one-tenth that of world-class banks. They were, in the words of one analyst, “managed to be weak.”

Furthermore, Korea's economic success had relied on foreign borrowing. The World Bank pointed out that if Korea had relied on domestic savings alone, its economic growth rate, which was 8.2 percent between 1962 and 1982, would have been only 4.9 percent. At the end of 1997, as foreign creditors pulled back on lending, Korea faced a severe liquidity crisis. By some estimates 61 percent of the foreign borrowings of Korean banks were short term, and many of these short-term loans were invested in long-term projects by chaebol borrowers who had expected the loans to be rolled over every year.

Over the course of 1997, seven chaebols, including Hanbo Steel, either went bankrupt or sought the banks' help on loan repayment. This stoked the fears of Korea's foreign creditors, who became even more unwilling to roll over their short-term loans. The government used its dwindling foreign exchange reserves to pay back overseas money it had guaranteed.

In late November 1997, Seoul went to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to ask for help. South Korea negotiated a $58 billion rescue package, the largest in history, which was agreed to in early December. But even that failed to stem the tide. An internal memorandum prepared by the Bank of Korea on December 18, 1997, suggested that the foreign exchange reserve balance on December 31 would be anywhere from negative $600 million to positive $900 million. According to economist Kihwan Kim, “No wonder foreign creditors further accelerated the withdrawal of their funds from Korea, pushing the country to the verge of a sovereign default in less than two weeks after the initial agreement was signed.”

Ultimately, foreign banks agreed to extend their loan maturities, at greatly increased interest rates. The IMF rescue package came with conditions on austerity and restructuring, including a mandate to sell off to foreign investors two failed banks, Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank. Although unspoken, the apparent reason for selling these banks to foreign buyers was the need to bring a credit culture into Korea's banking system. Previously, loans had been made on the basis of government policies or personal relationships, without much regard to the creditworthiness of borrowers. Selling the two banks was driven by more than the need for capital; it was part and parcel of Korea's banking reforms in the wake of the crisis.

* * *

The teasers about Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank I read in the car that sunny New York morning said: “The Government is seeking an international commercial bank to purchase a minimum of 50.1 percent interest in the bank through a new issuance of common stock.” Both banks were among South Korea's largest in terms of number of customers, branch network, and market share of loans and deposits. They also had a massive amount of debt that had become uncollectible. The teasers noted that both banks held bad loans that were expected to represent 25 percent of the banks' total loans. That was an astounding number, far greater than the banks' capital, which typically was just 5 percent of their assets. With 25 percent of loans considered uncollectible, both banks were insolvent many times over.

No foreign buyer was expected to sink money into the capital hole created by the bad loans. To entice them, the government offered to put its own money into the banks, to largely fill the hole. As part of the deal:

The Korean government has made available a government support package to potential investors … which provides protection against existing and future deterioration in the asset quality (on both loans and securities). This protection is in the form of reimbursement of loan loss charge-offs and government guarantees on the securities portfolio.



As the Korean government's advisor, Morgan Stanley was tasked with finding potential investors and helping the government negotiate a deal with them. The solicitation specifically stated that the Korean government was “seeking an international commercial bank.” Despite this, Newbridge, a private equity investor, had been invited. Obviously, Morgan Stanley had decided to cast the net wider, fearing there would not be enough interested buyers. I did not find that surprising.

“Who would want to buy a failed bank in a failed economy in the middle of the worst economic crisis the country has ever experienced?” I wondered aloud.

Carroll was more thoughtful. “We should ask Bondo,” he said. “If anyone knows how to do a bank deal, it's him,”

David Bonderman, co-chairman of Newbridge, had experience with failing banks. About 10 years earlier, as the chief investment officer at the Robert M. Bass Group, he had helped Bass acquire and recapitalize the then-insolvent American Savings Bank (ASB) during the U.S. savings and loan crisis. Bass had taken control of ASB, which had once been the second-largest savings bank in the country, in a government-assisted transaction. In such a transaction, the government is the seller, as it has already taken over the failed bank and will take the responsibility for the risks of the bank's legacy assets (assets that were on the bank's books before the new owners take control) by paying the bank for losses from those assets. After turning around the bank, Bass sold it, making multiples of the money invested.

Bonderman was known to be a contrarian, buying businesses most other investors would shun. Incidentally, he was scheduled to visit Korea the very next month.

Chen sent a memo to Bonderman and Newbridge’s co-chairman, Dick Blum, a couple days later, outlining the information in the teasers and giving a brief summary of the pros and cons we identified in a potential deal.

Bonderman responded with his customary swiftness, by fax:

I think that your memo is precisely on point in the sense that for an opportunity to exist here the Korean government will have to give much better protections than it is proposing. On the other hand, the history of life is that well-protected failed bank deals are an excellent way to make money if you can buy them at the bottom of the cycle. Accordingly, I think it is worth your while hanging around this process to see what develops.



Asia was now in a full-blown financial crisis. As money rushed out of these economies, panic set in. At one point, the Indonesian rupiah had fallen by 86 percent against the dollar. The currencies of Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines were all down by 40 to 60 percent; stock markets suffered losses of at least 75 percent in dollar terms. In 1998, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand saw their real GDP shrink by an average of 11 percent. The whole South Korean economy declined by 7.8 percent. Many millions of people had lost their jobs. Numerous companies failed.

As the financial crisis swept through Asia, China remained relatively insulated. There was no capital flight from China, mainly because its foreign borrowing was limited and the Chinese yuan was not freely convertible. Chinese individuals and companies could not easily move their money abroad and into other currencies. Although China remained stable, asset prices in the rest of Asia collapsed. This made China the most expensive market in Asia for investors. That was not good news for Newbridge, which had been founded as a China-focused fund engaged in the business of buying and turning around undervalued Chinese companies. As investment opportunities in China got scarce, we began to look at the rest of Asia, from South Korea to Indonesia, for good businesses to invest in. The fund Carroll and I were in New York to raise money for was planned as an Asia-wide fund, not limited to China. The failed Korean banks could turn out to be promising investments.

On October 9, 1998, Bonderman and I arrived in Seoul. We were there to meet with Hun-jai Lee, chairman of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), a newly established regulatory agency tasked with helping fix Korea's financial sector. The meeting took place at the FSC's offices in Yeouido, an island in the Han River, which ran through the middle of Seoul. The island was home to the National Assembly and many government offices.

Slightly built and bespectacled, Chairman Lee came across as serious, thoughtful, and confident. He held a master's degree in economics from Boston University and studied at Harvard. He spoke English with a Korean accent. He was accompanied by his staff and a team of Morgan Stanley bankers.

After introductions, Bonderman talked about his successful experience investing in ASB. He described the good bank/bad bank structure used in the ASB transaction, which required separating the good and bad assets of the bank into two separate entities. New investors would invest in the good bank, while the bad bank, owned by the government, would focus on resolving all of the nonperforming legacy loans. This model was not dissimilar to Morgan Stanley's proposal on behalf of the government, in that the government had offered to provide protection to investors against bad loans. Bonderman's model would create a good bank to hold the good assets, which could concentrate on conducting normal banking business. Without having to worry about managing bad legacy loans, the good bank could resume growth.

Lee listened attentively as his aides took notes. He asked a few questions for clarification, and I sensed that he had a quick mind and grasped the key points. Toward the end, Bonderman suggested that we would be interested in submitting a proposal under two conditions. The first, of course, was that the Korean government would be willing to consider a proposal from Newbridge, despite its stated preference for bids from commercial banks. Second, it would have to be willing to consider a proposal that would not fully conform to Morgan Stanley's guidelines. Even though Morgan Stanley outlined that the government would provide some protection against the inherent losses and risks of the bad loans, we thought the measures were inadequate and wanted more robust protection.

Lee was cautious. I was sure that this was in part because he had probably never heard of Newbridge. He looked at us and asked, “Do you have enough capital to buy what used to be the largest bank in Korea?”

“Capital is no constraint,” I replied, without elaborating further.

Newbridge's first fund had raised less than $100 million in capital, and that money was already fully invested. Newbridge II, our second investment vehicle, had a target of $400 million, which we were still in the process of raising. Before they became insolvent, Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank each had something on the order of $40 billion in assets. Even in their slimmed-down size, it would probably require about a billion dollars to recapitalize each one of them, after the government cleaned up all the bad assets.

My thinking, however, was that if a deal was good enough, we would have no problem raising the capital we would need; but if the deal was not good enough, we would not invest a penny anyway. Therefore, I felt confident saying that capital was not a constraint. It all depended on what kind of deal we could negotiate.

Chairman Lee thanked us for the visit and encouraged us to submit a proposal.

I found the mood in Seoul gloomy. Every company we met with was trying to raise capital. This was understandable, because the entire country seemed to be deeply in debt.

The financial crisis had been particularly hard on corporate Korea. During the high-growth years, companies had become used to having their loans rolled over or renewed when due, usually annually. But now banks were so squeezed for money themselves, they would not roll over the loans. This caught many Korean firms by surprise, forcing them into bankruptcy and leaving their employees without jobs. These corporate bankruptcies added to the woes of banks and drove the tally of their troubled loans higher, further squeezing capital, and the vicious cycle continued.

Whereas the average debt-to-equity ratio of American companies stood at about 70 percent, the same ratio was more than 300 percent for Korean companies. For the largest chaebols, the average was an astounding 500 percent. That meant for every $100 in capital, the company had $500 in debt. By the end of 1998, 14 of Korea's top 30 chaebols were bankrupt or nearly so.

The $58 billion bailout package Korea negotiated with the IMF did not immediately cure the economy's woes. Furthermore, the associated austerity conditions were deeply unpopular with the Korean public. Many, ironically, blamed the IMF for their pain. What was called the Asian Financial Crisis elsewhere was popularly referred to in South Korea as the IMF Crisis. It was as if a doctor had saved a patient with some bitter medicine, and the patient blamed the doctor, and the medicine itself, for the illness. Despite the IMF's help, South Korea was in dire need of more foreign capital. Before the crisis, South Korea had been one of the markets most closed to foreign direct investment (FDI). The government, fearing foreign entry into the industries it had nurtured, preferred loans rather than FDI as a source of capital, which it could more easily dole out to favored industries and businesses. The crisis and the ensuing capital shortage forced the country to scrap its previous limits on foreign ownership. But as is often the case in financial crises, just as South Korea opened its door wide to FDI, foreign capital was stampeding for the exits. To us, it signaled an opportunity.

After our visit to Seoul, we decided there was enough potential in the deal to continue to follow through. We put together a proposal, or term sheet, for the investment, which we intended to model on the deal structure for ASB. We would need an investment bank and a law firm to help us work through the complicated financial and legal aspects of the proposal, so Bonderman suggested the Financial Institutions Group at Lehman Brothers and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, both based in New York City. They had worked on the ASB deal and were familiar with its structure and terms.

Lehman assembled a team of experienced bankers including Phil Erlanger, Michael O'Hanlon, David Kim, and others. Cleary's team included Michael Ryan and Linda Matlack, both of whom had worked on the ASB transaction. I also engaged Dr. Jihong Kim to be our advisor. A professor at Hanyang University in Seoul, Jihong was an old friend and classmate of mine from U.C. Berkeley's PhD program. He had graduated from Seoul National University, the best university in South Korea, and earned an MBA from Harvard. He knew the country and many of its key players well, including Chairman Lee of the FSC.

As customary, for the purpose of internal use and confidentiality, we gave the proposed investment a codename, Project Safe, which has the double meaning of, in its adjective form, being protected from risks, as a bank ought to be, and of being a secure vault-like box.

By October 15, 1998, we had produced a first draft of the term sheet for a controlling investment in one of the two banks for sale. The major terms required the government to remove all the bad loans and assets from the balance sheet, creating a good bank, and then to fill the hole left by the removal of the bad assets with an interest-bearing government IOU, which we referred to as the government note. Newbridge and the government would jointly invest enough money to bring the bank's capital up to the minimum required by banking regulation, and Newbridge's ownership would be 51 percent. The government would own the other 49 percent. Newbridge would have full control of the good bank. If we discovered any remaining bad loans after the deal closed, we would also have the right to put them to the government, meaning we could sell them back at the original book value (i.e., 100 cents on the dollar) plus accrued interest.

In the Morgan Stanley proposal, the government offered to take all the bad loans and assets off the balance sheet of the good bank before the closing of the sale, but it offered to pay only 80 cents on the dollar for any charge-offs discovered on the legacy loan book after closing. Our proposal required 100 cents, which we thought was reasonable. We wanted to buy a ship and its cargo, but only after damaged goods were removed. The investment would work only if the seller would agree to take away and pay the buyer the original value for any damaged goods subsequently discovered in the original cargo. Otherwise, we would risk sinking money into a hole of unknown depth.

Our proposed deal structure was modeled after the ASB transaction, but, due to the many Korea-specific peculiarities, we had to modify the terms. While going over some questions about the ASB deal with Bonderman, he said, “My memory is foggy on the details. You should check with Lehman and Cleary guys for details.” But it soon became clear that Bonderman remembered the terms, and the related thought process, better than anyone, so we repeatedly checked with him to make sure we did not miss anything.

Unlike the rest of us, Bonderman did not use email. We communicated with him only by fax or by phone. Wherever he might be, he would respond to any memo as soon as he read it, by dictating his reply over the phone to his secretary, who was based in Fort Worth, Texas. If it was after office hours, he spoke into a tape recorder and his secretary would transcribe the message and fax it out as soon as she received it. I now feel fortunate he was so old-fashioned, because I managed to gather a trove of physical memos that have been crucial in reconstructing the deal for this book. (It took Bonderman some time to catch up with the modern world. Ten years later he and I went together to the Beijing Summer Olympics. One day we were sitting a few rows apart in the vast and crowded stadium. Before the event finished, I got a text message from him: “Meet at gate question mark.” It turned out he couldn't figure out how to type a “?” on his Nokia phone so he spelled it out.)

After more than a week of working on drafts internally, we finally dispatched our term sheet to Morgan Stanley. Our proposal did not specify which of the two banks we would acquire, as we did not yet have enough information about either to make a decision, but the deal structure we proposed would apply to either Korea First or Seoul Bank.

The term sheet outlined the good bank/bad bank model we had discussed with Chairman Lee in our meeting in Seoul. The good bank would contain substantially all of the bank's performing loans and assets, as well as its facilities, branches, and deposits. It would also hold the right to exercise a put option to sell to the government any bad loans which were discovered later on (any new loans made under our ownership would of course be excluded from the put right). All nonperforming loans (NPLs) would be transferred to a bad bank, which would be a government-owned entity.

My cover letter highlighted the merits of our proposal. The good bank, once freed from its legacy bad loans,

would alleviate the public's anxiety about the safety of their deposits, enabling it to attract new deposits and reducing the bank's cost of funding. The restructured bank would have a drastically reduced risk of failure and would provide a strong signal to the international community that the government was serious about financial sector reforms. Its success would be critical in restoring confidence, both overseas and at home, in Korea's financial system. By retaining a 49 percent ownership stake in the good bank, the government would share the upside from our success in turning around the bank; these proceeds would offset the overall cost of banking sector reform.



I did not realize, until much later, what a difference the last point would make in the government's consideration of our offer. To save these banks, the government had already poured 1.5 trillion Korean won (about $1.125 billion) into each of them, and expected to add many times that amount, as more and more loans became impaired. The government had a strong desire to recover as much of the taxpayers' money as possible. Many officials found the opportunity to share in the upside of a recovery very appealing. We were, of course, not the only bidders. The team at the FSC was also negotiating with two strategic investors, Citibank and HSBC. Both were major international banks—exactly what the teasers specified—and were preferred over Newbridge as potential buyers. The FSC Chairman Lee recalled in his 2012 memoir (which I only read the English translation of an excerpt on KFB), “The government wanted to deal with HSBC with an expectation that we would learn advanced management methods and if we sold the bank to the world's best bank, it would better enhance our sovereign credit ratings.”

The government's preference for a major bank might explain why we did not hear back from it until nearly three weeks later, just days before the bank's self-imposed deadline for a deal on November 15.

“Just an update on Project Safe,” wrote my colleague Chen. “We had a conversation with Morgan Stanley earlier today to clarify aspects of our term sheet. Morgan indicated that our proposal, while different from that of the government, was nevertheless reasonable, particularly given the potentially substantial upside for the government to help reduce the cost of banking reform.”

Meanwhile, I received a handwritten note from our advisor Jihong Kim, who thought that “[t]he Korean government and the FSC are more favorable to strategic investors than to financial investors [such as Newbridge]…. By attracting a world-renowned bank into Korea, the FSC wants to have announcement effects in the world financial community…. If Newbridge teams up with a major bank, I feel confident that Newbridge will be the preferred candidate.”

Among our investors whom we call limited partners, Newbridge had many blue-chip financial institutions, including GE Capital, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, MetLife, and others. We thought we might be able to entice one of them to co-invest with us if we put a good deal together, but their role would still be that of a financial investor rather than a strategic one. Few big banks had any appetite to invest strategically in a broken bank in the middle of a financial crisis. Still, to the Korean government, such a major financial institution could bring a valuable “announcement effect” to the table, even if it came in as a junior co-investor in a deal led by Newbridge.

I called Jihong and told him we would try Bank of America (BofA), whose principal investment arm was an investor with Newbridge Capital. Blum's firm had made a major investment in BofA during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, which we could point to, alongside Bonderman's turnaround of ASB, as evidence of our collective expertise reviving problem banks. If we could bring in BofA's principal-investing arm as a co-investor, I thought, it would make us more appealing to the Korean government.

My suggestion worked, at first. Jihong Kim sent through the FSC's initial response on November 23, 1998, which said that FSC officials were pleased about the potential to bring in BofA as a co-investor. They also made it clear that the FSC wanted Newbridge to communicate with the FSC directly instead of working through Morgan Stanley. This caught my attention. I wondered why the government wanted to go around its own advisors.

I suspected it was a signal that the FSC's negotiations with other parties were not going well, or that it was losing confidence in Morgan Stanley. It was a sign that Newbridge might be closer to making a deal than we realized.

However, the next day Jihong sent another note. The FSC had issues because BofA already held a stake in another Korean bank, KorAm Bank, which was also in trouble. We decided to instead approach GE Capital, the investment arm of the American industrial giant and also a limited partner of ours, through its office in Hong Kong. GE Capital was interested. I immediately informed the FSC, which seemed to be pleased and invited us to meet at our earliest convenience.

* * *

Almost three months after we first saw the invitation from Morgan Stanley, negotiations with the FSC seemed to be getting serious. We met on December 11, 1998, at FSC headquarters. There were seven of us on our side: Carroll, Chen, our advisor Jihong Kim, and I represented the Newbridge team; Phil Erlanger and David Kim of Lehman Brothers; and Nancy Ku from GE Capital. We met with Dong-soo Chin, director general of the Financial Restructuring Task Force of the FSC; his deputy, Sung-hun Kim; and others of the FSC staff.

Chin looked youthful, much younger than his 49 years, and scholarly with pale skin, dark hair, and spectacles. He was gentle in his manners and soft in his speech. His deputy, Sung-hun Kim, looked to be in his late 30s. Referred to as Dr. Kim, he was also a scholarly type, gentle, patient, and detail-oriented. The two of them made a good negotiating team.

We presented Chin and his team with an overview of our credentials, including our investor base, and the various bank deals we had done, including those our principals had led at TPG, RCBA, and Newbridge. We explained the merits of the good bank/bad bank model and the basic elements of our term sheet. Chin expressed appreciation for the deal structure we proposed, especially as it allowed the Korean government to participate in almost half of any upside from the deal. I could tell he really liked that.

The main sticking point, as the meeting went on, was the put option, the right to transfer back bad loans to the government after the transaction had closed. How long would the put right last? And at what price would the government be obligated to buy these bad loans? The government's original position, per the documents sent out by Morgan Stanley, was that it would allow the investor to sell back bad loans and assets for a period of three years. But now the FSC had changed its mind, saying it would agree to a one-year put. We countered by asking that it remain in force for at least two years.

The FSC also wanted the investor to share 20 percent of the losses from legacy loans when the investor exercised the put right. This was not acceptable to us; 20 percent of a black hole was still a black hole. Such loss-sharing could easily wipe out the new capital we planned to inject into the bank. Loan-level due diligence (“Due diligence” refers to a process of thorough investigation) would have been hard even in normal circumstances; in an economic crisis, when virtually all borrowers were struggling, figuring out which loans would go bad in the future and transferring all of them to the government before the transaction closed would be almost impossible. The risk was too great and too hard to quantify.

The FSC team did not seem to think our position unreasonable. However, they countered, if the good bank was given the accommodating terms we envisioned—basically, an unlimited put-back right—it would have no incentive to work out these problem loans. They were concerned about creating a moral hazard because it would be too easy for the bank to get rid of a troubled loan without incurring any losses, as opposed to making a reasonable effort to work it out. I thought the government's concern was legitimate and suggested we find other ways to address it.

Despite these differences, the meeting went well and lasted four hours. It was clear that the FSC was engaging with us seriously. After we adjourned the meeting, all of us from both sides went to a Chinese restaurant nearby for lunch. I thought it was a good sign that everyone liked fried sauce noodle, a typical Chinese dish with a Chinese name, zha-jiang-mian, that was pronounced similarly in Korean. At least in this dish, we found good chemistry and understanding between us.
