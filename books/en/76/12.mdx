title: 12 Sign It or Forget It
---






I directed the driver to take me to the Kim & Chang office in Jongno-gu District in downtown Seoul. On the short drive from the Grand Hyatt, I passed Gwanghwamun Square; at its center is a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, the sixteenth-century naval hero who repeatedly defeated Japanese invaders. It marks the center of Seoul. So much of the Korean identity was wrapped up in the idea of keeping foreigners out that Korea has been called the “Hermit Kingdom.” The economic crisis was forcing South Korea to open up its market more than ever for foreign investments. Little wonder that Koreans viewed foreign investors with suspicion and distrust.

The car moved slowly through Seoul's evening rush-hour traffic, taking me much longer than usual to get to the office. Hyun and his colleagues were waiting for me. He got right to the point: “I think we have been able to resolve all the issues except one. We need to talk with you about it.”

I let out a barely audible groan. Hashing out deal terms with the FSC was like playing Whac-A-Mole: As soon as we agreed on one issue, another would pop up.

Hyun told me he and his colleagues had spent more than two hours that day negotiating with Chairman Lee. In addition to my explanatory note on our position on various issues and terms, they had also prepared a lengthy note in Korean to argue our case with Lee. In it, they carefully reviewed the FSC's “remaining issues.” Referring to my memo, Hyun pointed out to Lee that Newbridge could be trusted, as we respected prior commitments, reason, and logic. Finally, Lee said that he would drop all other issues but one.

“If you will agree to restore Newbridge's original language for adjudication related to ‘involuntary bankruptcy,’ I will be ready to sign the TOI,” said Lee.

“Involuntary bankruptcy” referred to bankruptcies initiated by creditors, usually banks, but not by the borrowers themselves. For example, a bank might refuse to honor or cash a check issued by a borrower, effectively denying it credit, which legally could lead the borrower into bankruptcy.

I was surprised, because the language on involuntary bankruptcy had been changed at the FSC's request only the day before, after much argument between the parties. Now they wanted to revert to our original language?

Without any hesitation I said, “I am fine with it.”

Ambassador Hyun and his colleagues looked at each other, relieved.

I called Rich Lincer and Linda Matlack, our Cleary lawyers who had drafted the TOI, asking them to make the change. To my surprise, they objected to the change and to restoring our old language.

They explained that the old language was fine if applied to all cases of disputes, as we had it. But we had moved away from that construct after conceding to FSC's request. If we used the old language only for “involuntary bankruptcy,” it would imply that this particular situation would be treated differently from all other cases and other types of disputes.

Ah, that was the catch. It was like an insurance policy having a specific sentence to say fire damage to a desk would be covered. That sentence itself would not be a problem, but the implication was that there would be no coverage for other pieces of office furniture.

I did not want to deny the FSC's new request outright, so I asked the lawyers to craft some language they felt comfortable with. After much back-and-forth, we agreed among ourselves to add a sentence to the restored original language to ensure that other cases would not be excluded. It was already midnight when we submitted the new language to the other side.

Soon word came from the government side that they felt the added language was too rambling, and they would no longer insist on any change at all. They requested that our lawyers prepare a final version of the TOI to be delivered to the FSC at eight the next morning.

The next morning, September 17, Chung called me and said that the FSC insisted on adding some language that all transfer events could be referred to the court in addition to a well-defined adjudication process. Nor would they agree to make payments, subject to refund, before adjudication was concluded. I went back and forth with Lee's team through our lawyers on these issues until we reached a compromise. It was already three in the afternoon.

I did not send these revisions to our team members because I did not consider the changes substantive, nor did I want our team members to know I was still negotiating with the FSC, as the collective view was that further negotiations were off. I had received a note from Bonderman:

Shan,

I have gotten a thick red line draft of the TOI from Linda Matlack. My view is that I am not going to read another draft because we are making a mistake by proceeding further. Tell Lee to sign it or forget it.

David Bonderman



Later that afternoon, Ambassador Hyun told me that the FSC was ready to sign, and the signing was scheduled for 8 pm. Only then did I realize we had been so busy that I had completely forgotten the lunch I had ordered and left on the table. But there was no time to eat; I had to prepare a press announcement. While Bonderman had refused to review the TOI, he was happy to be woken up to help edit the press release.

I had been wearing my suit the whole day in anticipation of signing the TOI. I left my hotel at 7 pm and headed for the FSC, where I was the sole representative from Newbridge, as none of my team members were still in Seoul. I arrived at 7:45 pm and went up to the 15th floor, to a conference room not far from Director General Noh's office. Then I realized that, in my haste, I had not brought a pen to sign the papers. BM Park had arrived before me, to do a final review of the documents, and he let me borrow his burgundy-colored Montblanc.

Shortly after I arrived, Noh entered the room without a word of greeting, followed by BS Kang and other members of the FSC team. They lined up in single file, according to their rank. Noh wore his usual frozen-fish expression, pale and cold. He was angry, no doubt, that the TOI had been negotiated without him. He did not spare me a glance. I was not surprised that he was unhappy, because it seemed he had been completely cut out of the negotiation process in the last couple of months. I had not seen him since early July. I reckoned he may not have known until the last minute that the TOI was to be signed.

Noh sat down across the table from me and immediately proceeded to sign the documents laid out in front of him. This was unusual; typically, two parties at such a signing ceremony would sit on the same side of the table. I proceeded to sit down on my side of the table to sign the documents in front of me. After we finished signing the papers before us, Park exchanged the documents between us for countersigning.

There was complete silence in the room, other than the rustle of paper. And after we finished there was no applause and no congratulations. There was no exchange of signed copies. We both just left the documents on the table. I knew Park would collect my copy. Although the atmosphere was tense, I kept my cool. I might have looked serious, but I was happy that we had finally come to this point. With this legally binding term sheet, the deal was locked down, even though there was still a long way to go to complete it.

Contractually, a legally binding term sheet is not the final agreement. But if the parties fail to reach the final and definitive agreements, they are legally obligated to go through the transaction on the basis of the TOI. Therefore, I knew completing the definitive documentation would just be a matter of time from this point on. The deal was locked up.

The major terms of the TOI had been agreed. The government would equalize assets and liabilities of KFB by filling the hole left by carved-out bad assets with an interest-bearing government note. Then Newbridge and the government would contribute equity capital for 51 percent and 49 percent of the common stock, respectively. The portion of Newbridge’s investment would be 500 billion won. The government would receive warrants representing 5 percent of common stock. Newbridge would select the assets for KFB to retain. The loan portfolio retained by KFB would effectively be marked at 96.5 percent of the original book value by KFB keeping 3.5 percent of already funded loan loss reserves. The retained loans would be protected by the government in the next 2 to 3 years depending on the loan type in such a manner that the management of KFB would periodically determine additional loan loss reserves and the government would fund such reserves with a government note. There was a mechanism to resolve disputes over the impaired amount. Newbridge would have 100 percent voting control of new KFB.

The deal in the TOI was a significant improvement for the government from the MOU, especially in that the 96.5 percent mark on the retained loans was substantially lower than anticipated if they had been marked to market as contemplated in the MOU. But Newbridge would take over a clean bank whose legacy assets would be fully protected by the government, and would no longer pose risks to the bank.

I stood up and extended my hand to shake Mr. Noh's. Still without looking at me, he took my hand, shook it lightly, and let it go. Then he turned and left the room without saying a word. Boy, he was angry!

Mr. Chun, who was seconded from KFB to the FSC and was a member of the FSC team, shook my hand and broke the silence. Looking into my eyes, he said, “Congratulations.” He was the only person from the FSC team who had even a trace of smile on his face. I knew others were friendly, but none of them wanted to show it in the presence of Mr. Noh. I did not blame them. It would only invite trouble with Noh if they appeared too friendly with me.

A group of reporters were waiting in an adjacent room. When Chairman Lee and I signed the MOU nine months ago, we held a joint press conference. Noh did not seem to want to be seen with me, so he did his own press briefing. I waited for about half an hour for my turn to meet the press with Park, who kindly volunteered to act as my interpreter. I spent about 45 minutes talking and taking questions. My message was simple. I said that we were happy to reach this stage and that the deal was good for all parties, including the government, the bank, and Newbridge. I said that, although we had work to do to finalize the definitive documents, both the government and Newbridge were now legally committed to completing the transaction under the terms and conditions of the TOI.

The general sense I got was that the journalists were surprised that we had reached this stage. They had already heard from Noh about the basic terms of the TOI, especially how much capital we would invest in KFB. But they had a number of questions left for me:

“How much control does Newbridge have of the bank?” asked one reporter.

I answered, “Newbridge will have full control of the bank, regardless of how much the government owns. Newbridge will have 100 percent of the voting rights. This is what the government wants too. It doesn't want to renationalize the bank. The idea is for us to bring in world-class management, so it would be counterproductive if we didn't have full control.”

Another reporter began a more complex inquiry. “The government will acquire all the nonperforming loans of KFB by the closing of the sale, and will give KFB the put right to transfer loans that become nonperforming in the next two years. For loans to financial institutions, the term of the put will be three years. Why?”

I explained that it was important to make sure the bank would be clean to begin with. We didn't want to inherit previous mistakes.

“Who will determine whether a loan is good or bad if it is subject to the put right?” asked another reporter.

“The management of KFB, appointed by Newbridge, will make all loan classifications. The management will make the provisions for nonperforming loans and the government will fund the provisions. If the government disputes the loan value or the provision determined by KFB, it has the option to buy the loan at face value and sell it to a third party at a better price. It's very fair,” I explained.

There was one more important question: “What are your immediate objectives for KFB after taking control?”

I said, “We would like to return the bank to profitability as soon as possible. This will almost definitely happen in the next two years, hopefully sooner.”

On my way back to the hotel, I called Daniel Poon, who was still in the office in Hong Kong at that late hour. I said, “Daniel, we finally signed the TOI.”

There was a pause on the other side of the line. Then with a tone of incredulity, he said, “Really? Are you serious?”

I flew back to Hong Kong on Saturday, September 18, 1999, the day after signing the TOI. When I landed that afternoon, I saw that media, including Bloomberg and the South China Morning Post, had already reported the story. I was so happy to be home, with the deal finally locked down. I spent all my time with our children over the weekend. During my past visits home, I had spent so much time working or on the phone that I felt I had hardly seen them. I had missed them a lot. LeeAnn, my seven-year-old, told me that she had learned some big words by overhearing me on these calls, such as “loan,” “agreement,” “idiosyncrasy,” and “xenophobia.” That day, I fell asleep before she did, while I was lying next to her reading her a bedtime story. It was the best sleep I had had in months.

The Terms of Investment, signed on September 17, 1999, was only 22 pages long, not counting the signature page. But it more than doubled the 10-page MOU of December 31, 1998. The legally binding TOI superseded the MOU and incorporated terms that the MOU had not contemplated. Whereas the MOU was an agreement at a conceptual level, the TOI contained operational details, which would need to be covered even more deeply in the pending, fully fledged final documents.

* * *

I was back in Seoul with my team members on Monday. Even with the signed TOI, we were still a long way away from closing the transaction. There were numerous details left to work out. For example, we needed to inform the government side what KFB assets we would not want. Although we already had some good ideas based on our preliminary due diligence, we had not wanted to expend resources on digging deeper before we knew there was a deal. There was a lot of work to be done before we could confirm our initial conclusions. Additionally, we had to negotiate and finalize the definitive documents—essentially, the final contract—that would incorporate the terms of the TOI and then expand them into operational details that could be executed.

I circulated a memo titled “Next Steps” on September 19, including a list of things that we needed to get started on immediately:

Prepare a list of overseas [KFB] branches and subsidiaries we will not retain ([to be completed by] Cleary, Bain, K&C, Newbridge). By the TOI, this needs to be done within a month.

Prepare a list of facilities we will not retain ([to be completed by] Bain, K&C, NB) within a month.

Revise and deliver draft definitive documents (Cleary).

Form a transition team to work within the KFB: S.H. Lee and Won-kyu Choi (of the KFB) and discuss with the FSC. Among other things, this team is necessary to ensure correct classification of loans by the closing time, the proper use of overdraft facilities so the balance will not significantly decline at the closing, and responsible credit and loan policy.

Recruit management team.

Establish timetable with the FSC.

Update financials (E&Y and Lehman).

Sources of capital.

PR issues.





I sent a similar letter to Ambassador Hyun, entitled “Next Steps,” so that we could align our next steps and timetable in the next phase of the transaction. There was one thing I was keen to find out from the government side, which was exactly who we would be working with to finalize the deal. “As you know, we have reason to be concerned about who would lead this process,” I wrote.

In view of the hostility that Noh exhibited at the signing and how difficult it had been for us to work with him, I dreaded a repeat of past experiences even though a binding term sheet had already been signed. I was also slightly concerned that the White & Case lawyers would continue to make life difficult for us.

We soon found out. At breakfast Monday morning with the Kim & Chang lawyers, I was delighted to hear that we would be dealing with a different team on the government side. The FSC would hand over the rest of the transaction process to another government agency, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, or KDIC. The team would report to Chairman Lee of the FSC, in addition to its usual boss, the Minister of Finance and Economy. I learned from Ambassador Hyun that the government side had decided that Noh could not handle the transaction. The head of the KDIC team had joined the Lehman Brothers roadshow for the aborted Hanvit offering, and our friends at Lehman told us he was a very reasonable man.

Meanwhile, we carefully monitored the Korean press to see how the deal announcement was being received. The local reaction was mixed, as I reported in a memo to Blum and Bonderman:

It applauds the deal but criticizes the FSC for having sold “too cheap.” Lee had to come out to defend the transaction. The international reaction, as expected, is all positive, as is the stock market. Korea Exchange Bank went up 12% yesterday, the first day of trading since the announcement and bank stocks went up 3% in general. The KFB deal has become a national pastime and we also need to help the other side to continuously sell the deal to the public.



The fact that we would be working with the KDIC was a welcome change. The KDIC had been modeled after the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression, to restore trust in the American banking system. Like the FDIC, the KDIC insured retail deposits so that people who kept their money in the bank could get it back, within certain limits, even if the bank failed. When the KDIC bailed out retail depositors of a failed bank, it effectively became the bank's new owner. KDIC was 100 percent owned by the Korean government and therefore was regarded as a government agency. The head of KDIC reported to the Minister of Finance and Economy.

The KDIC had been founded in 1996 with a mandate to protect depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system. It began its operations as a deposit insurer on January 1, 1997, collecting its first deposit insurance premiums only on April 30 that year. That summer, the Asian Financial Crisis hit, and many banks failed, including, of course, KFB. For KDIC's finances, the timing of its birth could not have been unluckier. All the money KDIC had to dole out came from taxpayers, as KDIC was called upon to start paying out before it had collected meaningful amounts of deposit insurance premiums. It was like a new insurance company starting up business and writing a policy to cover all future hurricane damages for the entire nation, the day before the storm of the century hit.

* * *

It was only after the signing of the TOI that I noticed the change of weather. The summer heat had dissipated, giving way to the cool breeze of the autumn. It was the best season to run in the mountains, as leaves began to change color, presenting a splendid view of green, yellow, and red at every turn.

On September 29, 1999, we held an all-parties meeting at the office of KDIC. I counted 40 participants there, including representatives of KDIC, the FSC, KAMCO, KFB, and the advisors on both sides of the transaction. KAMCO was the Korea Asset Management Company, essentially the government-owned “bad bank,” which had been created to buy bad loans and assets. At the meeting, we discussed a timetable and the work required prior to closing the transaction, which we aimed to complete by the end of November.

Both sides agreed to the timetable and promised to work hard to finalize the deal as soon as possible. We briefly discussed the disposal of KFB's New York branch. Under the Bank Holding Act of the United States, a bank holding company was not permitted to engage in nonbanking businesses. If Newbridge became owners of KFB while the bank had U.S. branches, we would be considered a bank holding company for the purposes of the U.S. law. But the law prohibited a private equity firm from becoming a bank holding company. For this reason, we had no choice but to shut down or otherwise dispose of KFB's branches in the United States before we closed the deal. Shutting down KFB's New York branch was of little economic consequence to the bank, as the business volume there was insignificant and, if necessary, the bank could turn the branch into a finance subsidiary, which would be permitted by the law. The difference between a bank branch and a finance company owned by a bank is that the branch is licensed to take retail deposits whereas a finance company is not. But by the estimates of our U.S. counsel, disposing of the branch would mostly likely delay the closing of the transaction.

After months of tough negotiations and heated arguments with Noh's FSC team, we were pleased to discover that the KDIC team was friendly and cooperative, even though they were not exactly sure what they were supposed to do at the beginning. BS Kang, who was the only representative from the FSC at the meeting, greeted us, and we chatted with each other like old friends. Eric Yoon of White & Case was also there. Many times over the course of the deal, I had felt like reaching across the table and strangling him. He had acted in ways we thought were unreasonable and at times seemed to be forcefully pulling his client away from the table. But now that the binding TOI was behind us, he seemed a different person. He made a point of approaching me after the meeting. “Shan, I've got my marching orders to get the deal done,” he told me. We held no grudges against him, as we knew he was trying to be protective of his clients, even if he wound up being overprotective to the point of obstruction.

I had been trying to discuss the KFB transition plan with Chairman Lee ever since we'd signed the TOI, but after 10 days I was still not successful in setting up a meeting with him. After the all-parties meeting, Kang urged me not to wait for Lee but to discuss the transition plan with the KDIC's executive director, Dong-jun Paeng. He emphasized that the FSC would be supportive. I was delighted that our tough-negotiating counterparty had now turned into an old friend. Everyone on the government side seemed as motivated as we were to get the deal done. What a difference a binding document made!

* * *

While both sides negotiated, KFB continued to hemorrhage cash. The binding TOI was signed not a moment too soon. The bank lost a staggering 4.23 trillion won, or about $3.5 billion, in 18 months. To put things in perspective, the total assets of the bank had fallen to less than $30 billion by then, and approximately $1 billion of equity was required to recapitalize it. A recap was essential. Without it, the bank was paralyzed and would rapidly lose its franchise value. It needed a quick cleanup of its bad loans and an injection of fresh equity. The opponents who objected to letting us control the bank had missed the larger point: If radical action was not taken, this bank was simply going to disappear.

The National Assembly had begun its session, and a major topic of discussion was the KFB sale. That was why Chairman Lee was too busy to meet with me; he was called before the National Assembly to answer lawmakers' questions about the deal with Newbridge. There continued to be talk in the local press about KFB being sold too cheaply, which seemed to be the journalists' focus.

From the experience of the last several months, we knew that the Korean press would likely criticize and obsess over this deal for a long while. We and the government needed to win them over. We interviewed a number of PR firms in the hope of engaging one as soon as possible to help us, and the government was working hard to explain why the deal would benefit the Korean economy and taxpayers. In an interview with the Korea Times, Bong-kyun Kang, the Minister of Finance and Economy, defended the KFB transaction and tried to clarify the misunderstanding regarding the disproportionate injection of capital by the government and by Newbridge: the trillions of won that the government put into the bank had been used to pay back depositors, whereas the new capital invested by Newbridge (and the government) was to recapitalize the bank. Kang also reminded people that the government was going to receive 49 percent of the upside after Newbridge turned the bank around.

Despite this, the Korean press relentlessly compared the amount of capital the government injected into KFB with the amount of capital we would invest. But that was the wrong comparison. Yes, the capital injected by the government dwarfed what we were going to put in, but the critics overlooked the fact that the bank had lost a vast amount of money before Newbridge had come onto the scene. Depositors had entrusted KFB with their money, which had been insured by the government. The public funds were being used to repay those depositors, not to benefit Newbridge. Our investment was like spending $1 million to buy a warehouse that had lost some valuable diamonds for which the insurance company had paid the diamond owners $100 million. The value of the warehouse had no relation to the amount of compensation paid by the insurance company. But many Korean commentators and the public did not understand the difference and focused only on the difference between how much taxpayer money the government used to shore up the bank and how much the foreign investor would invest in the bank itself. They also appeared to ignore the fact that Newbridge was bringing in sound risk management practices, which would prevent similar depository losses in the future.

The public's fixation on the KFB transaction was understandable. After all, the government bailout used taxpayer money, and the public had every right to make sure it was not misused or squandered. We shared this concern and continued to feel that the best way to prevent additional waste was to bring in world-class banking practices, including a strong credit culture, and to restructure and reform Korea's moribund banking system. The significance of the KFB transaction went far beyond the sale of the bank and the foreign capital it brought into the country.

We spent a lot of time managing public relations in the weeks following the signing of the TOI. I met with numerous journalists, both Korean and Western, to get our message across. In early October, at the request of the Blue House, I held a press conference to explain the deal and answer questions from the media. Before a roomful of reporters, I addressed a few major issues of concern, including the transaction timetable, the new management team, and the question of whether there would be layoffs.

“We are working very closely with the Korean regulatory authorities to finish up the documentation,” I said, adding that the process was expected to be completed by the last week of November, although it might take longer. As for management, I explained that we intended to put together a team of foreign and Korean executives from among the best in the banking industry. For KFB's CEO, I hinted that we had someone in mind, a Westerner with long experience in banking and “a strong comprehension of Korean business and culture,” but I couldn't disclose the name before the transaction was completed.

On the question of layoffs, I told the reporters that they would be up to KFB's new management, although I tried to downplay the possibility of major employee reductions. “We think the size of this bank is just about right,” I said.

Finally I reiterated that Newbridge's primary goal was to turn KFB into the best player in the domestic banking industry once again, and I tried to dismiss the criticism that the government had sold the bank at too low a price. “Korea made a good deal,” I said.

The press coverage of my briefing was uniformly positive, which also pleased the Blue House, according to the ambassador. It seems that the press, at least some of them, accepted my explanation for why the deal was a fair and good one for Korea. Meanwhile, Chairman Lee and the head of the KFB, Shee-yul Ryoo, were also making a forceful defense of the deal. What a difference it felt to have the government behind us!

Bonderman, however, was more cautious. He sent me a note on October 8 that read:

Shan,

I saw the newspaper article and I understand why we need to take an affirmative campaign to the press, however, I think it is quite risky to say that we are going to close by any specific date since it is not within our control and even riskier to speculate on the new CEO since we don't have a clue who that will be. I think you need to be more cautious on this stuff.



I understood his concern, but under the circumstances, I could not respond to reporters' questions with a terse “no comment” if we wanted to achieve our PR objectives. The purpose of the press conference was to address reporters' inquiries as best I could so I made sure to answer questions to the extent of my knowledge without being specific about the things yet to be finalized.

It was true that both parties agreed to target closing at the end of November, although I also cautioned the audience that the date might slip due to technical reasons, including the disposal of KFB's U.S. branch. It was also true that we had a CEO candidate in mind, a senior executive at GE Capital, and we were conducting a broad search for other potential candidates. I was quite certain we had to bring in a CEO from outside of Korea. If I had evaded these two questions, there would be endless speculation and we would risk looking either somewhat clueless or too secretive about our plans.

* * *

The announcement of the binding TOI greatly boosted KFB employees' morale. They now had hope for a bright new future. Ryoo, the bank's chairman and president, sent an upbeat and motivating message to all employees on September 20, 1999. After thanking them for their hard work restoring the bank's business through difficult times, he shared his optimism about the bank's future and reassured his team that with an injection of new capital and the arrival of a skilled new management team, better days were ahead for KFB.

I really liked and respected Ryoo, who had done his best to stabilize the bank and its workforce and took tough measures to restore its health under extremely difficult circumstances. The bank continued to suffer huge losses from its historical bad loans, but Ryoo did what he could, and all of our team members who had met him were impressed with him. Another person might have sat on his hands and waited for the government bailout, as it was hopeless trying to dig the bank out of this hole on his own.

I thought we should retain him as chairman, even though everyone within the bank, in the government, and in the market expected us to replace him. When I floated the idea with my partners, they all agreed with me.

On October 5, I sat down with Ryoo and informed him that Newbridge would like him to stay on as chairman. Ryoo was surprised—although pleasantly so, I thought. He noted that the public would expect a new face at KFB. I explained that we would, of course, appoint a new CEO, who would have ultimate control and responsibility for the bank, but we hoped that Ryoo would be willing to stay on to help manage the internal and external relationships. Ryoo responded that he would need time to think before accepting the offer.

We also discussed a few other transition matters. I informed him that Newbridge would be sending in a transition team, headed by a transition CEO. In addition to members selected by Newbridge, the team would have representatives from the FSC and the KDIC. I also asked Ryoo to have the bank set up a special task force of its own, which would report directly to the transition team and the chairman.

For the special task force, I recommended that we put Won-kyu Choi in charge. During our initial campaign to get the MOU signed a year before, Choi had impressed me with his intelligence and integrity. He spoke fluent English and had been very supportive of the deal. I thought he was a good conduit for communication between the transition team and the bank's employees. However, he had fallen out of favor within the bank during our heated negotiations over the summer, and I suspected it was because of his support for the deal. Formerly the head of KFB's privatization team, Choi had been demoted and was now toiling as the manager of a seven-person bank branch. I wanted him reinstated to a corporate-level position where his skills would be put to good use.

Thankfully, Ryoo did not object to putting Choi in charge of the task force. Quite to the contrary; he immediately instructed his executive vice president to notify Choi to form the special task force. Ryoo also gave me a frank and succinct summary of his views on the rest of the senior management team. I told him that I would be happy to share ideas with the new CEO, who would be responsible for forming a management team of his own.

Later that day, my colleague Steve Lim and I went to meet with Dong-jun Paeng, the executive director of the KDIC and head of the organization's group working on the KFB deal. After an hour's discussion we tentatively agreed on the transition team's marching orders. Newbridge would appoint two or three members to the team, including the transition CEO and a head of credit. The KDIC would also appoint two or three people, while the FSC would send an observer. We expected that the team would be given some level of control over operations within the bank, primarily regarding lending and credit. In most cases, this would mainly be negative control, or oversight—for example, deciding not to approve a particular loan, so there would be no argument about loans made before close being subject to the government guarantee. At least nominally, major decisions would be made by the joint team. This was both to minimize Newbridge's liability and to avoid legal complications if we were to be viewed as having taken control of KFB before we'd been able to dispose of the New York branch.

It had been agreed to by the parties at the time of the MOU that our side would draft the transaction documents. There were three major ones. The first was the assistance agreement, which would detail the assistance provided by the government to KFB as part of the transaction. This included, among other things, our right to put bad assets back to the government and the government's payment in terms of government notes to the bank for the bad assets and loans to be transferred to the government. The second was the acquisition agreement, which set forth the terms and conditions under which Newbridge would invest in and acquire a majority ownership of KFB. The third was the shareholders' agreement, which would govern the relationship between Newbridge and the various government agencies, including the KDIC, the FSC, and the Ministry of Finance and Economy, which would all be shareholders of KFB.

These agreements would be written on the basis of the TOI. Where the TOI was only a couple of dozen pages, the definitive documents were expected to be hundreds of pages in length. It took almost a month for our lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb to draft them with the help of Kim & Chang and for the Newbridge team to review the drafts before we delivered them to KDIC. The Newbridge team, including me, reviewed every page, word by word, to make sure all our terms were accurately reflected. After we had sent the documents to the KDIC team, we expected them to do the same.

I was also quite satisfied with how our search for a transition leader was shaping up. Bob Barnum and I had spoken with Steve Hajtun, the CEO of GE Capital Finance, about coming on as the transition team leader, and both he and GE Capital Asia Pacific were very supportive of the arrangement, although he hadn't yet given us a firm answer. Meanwhile, Barnum had been spending a lot of time speaking with different KFB team members and advisors about their work. Chairman Ryoo had also decided to accept our offer to stay on as KFB chairman, although he asked us to keep that confidential until we had announced the new CEO. It seemed that everyone was united in our efforts to revamp KFB and make it an internationally respected institution.

Unfortunately, some legal issues soon arose to complicate matters. About a week after my last transition update to the team, I had to write again to say that it looked as if we might not need a transition team leader after all. Doing so could lead U.S. regulators to consider Newbridge as having crossed from a role of oversight to one of direct control. Even the idea of adding a new credit officer, our lawyers feared, would be an indication, from a legal perspective, that Newbridge had taken control of the bank. “We probably cannot begin to implement anything before the close,” I reported. But this didn't stop me from thinking ahead. I thought that Hatjun would make a great interim CEO, in case we didn't have a permanent CEO in place by the time the definitive documents were signed.

This was followed by more bad news. Ryoo informed me that he would not be remaining as chairman after all. He had been elected chairman of the Korea Federation of Banks, which was a full-time job that prohibited him from holding another position. Ryoo expressed his regret, and we contacted our headhunters to let them know that we would also be searching for a chairman.

Of all the work streams, the most important was the documentation of definitive agreements. This was a massive amount of work, involving negotiations between representatives of the KDIC and Newbridge and also between the lawyers on both sides. Even though the TOI served as a basis for the final agreements, the documentation process was like turning a book outline into a real book. Imagine the thorny process of two proud co-authors who must agree with each other on every word. Now imagine if each author also had to consult a team of editors and assistants who also had to agree. That was quite a bit what our discussions were like.

The transaction was extraordinarily complex because it involved not just a sales and purchase agreement between two parties but a complex government assistance program that had to treat various classes of the bank's assets differently and also anticipate every possible contingency.

To do this, both sides were assisted by a large team of lawyers and advisors. There were four law firms involved: Cleary Gottlieb and Kim & Chang on the Newbridge side, and White & Case and Lee & Ko, another well-known Korean firm, on the government side.

We received the KDIC's changes to the draft documents about three weeks after we had delivered them. While the government's markups weren't as bad as I'd feared, there were a number of issues we would need to contend with. A few days later, Paul Chen and I went to Kim & Chang to meet with our lawyers there, as well as Rich Lincer of Cleary Gottlieb. After five hours discussing the KDIC's requested changes, we came away with the impression that their requests were “largely manageable.”

Five days later, on November 14, Lincer sent through a memo that made me think otherwise. He sent me a list of issues identified at a meeting between all four law firms, and he included notes on each side's responses. It was 28 pages long, which was a grim sign. Lincer's message also predicted that we would once again return to an arduous negotiation process:

Overall, I would observe that, while the discussions were generally cordial and constructive in tone, it is clear from them that the lawyers are going to have to check back with the KDIC before making concessions on even the most minor of issues and that, in addition to some very fundamental business issues, it is clear that the KDIC is going to read the TOI very strictly and therefore has not been at all receptive where we have tried to introduce provisions to fill in the gaps in the TOI that are consistent with the spirit of the TOI. Therefore, our sessions next week (and undoubtedly thereafter) are going to be quite tedious and progress may be slower than we would like.



It seemed, once again, that we still had a long and difficult road ahead of us.

Quite unexpectedly, I received an urgent message on Friday, November 12, alerting me to an article in the Korea Times. The newspaper had obtained a copy of a study by Bain & Company, our consultant, recommending 1,000 KFB employee layoffs. The report was authentic, but we had long ago decided not to follow its recommendations, which was why in my October 5 press conference, I'd said the size of KFB's workforce was “about right.” It would be a blow to our credibility, as well as to the morale of KFB employees, if this layoff number were mistakenly reported as Newbridge's secret plan.

We needed to contain this story before it caused damage that would be nearly impossible to repair. The Korea Times article had already been posted to the paper's newswire and was destined for the next day's paper. I felt a rising sense of panic thinking about the consequences of this going to print.

I called Hyung-min Kim, the Korea Times reporter who wrote the article, with whom I had a good rapport. I told him the Bain report was old and that we had rejected its suggestion for layoffs, asking him to withdraw the article because it would be misleading. The paper had already typeset the pages, and it would be a hassle to remove and replace the article. But after a long conversation, I was able to persuade him to do so.

Phew, I thought. We had averted a major PR disaster.

However, the Korea Times article on the wire caught the immediate attention of KFB employees. In spite of a retraction the paper subsequently issued, the KFB labor union issued a statement denouncing the “planned action” by Newbridge Capital. This was unfortunate and needed to be managed before it spiraled out of control.

I invited Chang-lim Lee, the head of KFB's union, and his deputy, KS Choi, to lunch in the Korean restaurant of the Westin Chosun Hotel on November 18. My colleague Steve Lim went with me to help translate and take notes. Lee and I had met several months earlier, while Newbridge and the FSC were still locked in negotiations over the TOI. Our interview had even been published in the union newsletter. In general, I found the union leader to be a reasonable man with a strong sense of responsibility to his members. But as we talked, it became clear that while my objective was to get him to promise to talk with us before taking any action, his objective was to get me to commit to not laying off any employees. Our conversation went like a tug-of-war, but we managed to find common ground.

“Frankly speaking,” I told Lee, “the union's distribution of the recent statement was somewhat irresponsible because it was based on the Korea Times' mistake rather than actual facts. The Korea Times admitted the mistake and corrected the article in the final version. We had met each other before. If you had talked with me before taking the action, I could have answered your questions with facts.”

Lee replied that while he knew my stated policy and had read or heard it several times through the press, he suspected that the Korea Times article was not completely groundless. After all, it was based on a report produced by one of our own advisors.

“Our statement was a call for you to clarify, to explain what the facts are and what is really going to happen,” he told me. “It is fortunate I can ask you for clarification today.”

“It's unfortunate that we weren't able to meet before your statement,” I responded. Newbridge considers the union as an equal partner, I told him. “You should have checked with us first. Going forward,” I said, “Newbridge and the union have two options: One, ignore each other and we communicate directly with employees. Or two, trust each other and work together as partners.”

“I hope we can work as partners,” I suggested. “It won't help if you take a confrontational approach.”

Lee demurred. The union had never dealt with a foreign party before, he pointed out. “But in our past experience with the management, we have been betrayed many times.” The union leader wasn't looking for more words of assurance. What he needed, he said, was a guarantee. “We feel that it is Newbridge's responsibility to show real trustworthiness beyond just words.”

“We accept that your statement regarding the need to trust each other is fair,” I responded. But trust had to be built over time. I needed them to commit to working with us, at the very least, starting from this moment. “Before discussing further,” I said, “the two sides need to agree on what kind of a relationship we are going to have, now and in the future.”

Lee appreciated this. But he still pushed for a guarantee. “Talk is just one part of moving toward resolution,” he said. “As an example, even if South Korea receives a promise from North Korea that it won't attack, South Korea will still keep up its defenses in the event that the enemy will renege on its word.”

“Please don't compare us to North Korea,” I said. “We should not regard each other as enemies.”

“Between capitalists and labor there are always lines which divide the two,” Lee said. Finally, he pointed out: “This has all been caused by the Bain report. If the report is not true, the union needs a kind of guarantee.”

“Can you commit to speaking with us before taking any action from now on?” I asked.

Yes, the union leader agreed. He could commit to that.

Then I told him a story of my own experience as a brick maker in China's Gobi Desert. (For details, please see my book Out of the Gobi: My Story of China and America, published in 2019 by Wiley.) In order to improve our productivity, I desperately wanted to find capital to alleviate the pain of our hard labor. As a laborer, I would have welcomed the chance to work with capital, I told him. But I was not so fortunate. “Only by capital and labor working together could we maximize each other's value,” I said.

The irony was not lost on me that I, a former hard laborer, was now representing capital, negotiating with the leader of a labor union. I had a strong sense of empathy for the union and found it fairly easy to connect and work with it. Much of the money we invested, I told Lee, was on behalf of pension funds for employees of companies and government organizations around the world. Between labor and capital, it was not a zero-sum game. If we did not build a strong bank together, we would lose our capital and they would lose their jobs. But if we did build a strong bank, we would share in the fruits. I knew the union leaders and the employees had already made sacrifices to preserve the institution. I truly believed that we could and should work as partners.

I had to leave in a hurry for a meeting with the KDIC, but Lee and I agreed to meet again. My colleague Steve Lim stayed behind to finish lunch with the two union leaders. He told me later that Lee and his colleague talked between themselves after I left. Before our meeting they had intended to send another strong statement. After our meeting they decided to cancel it. I was glad that I had taken the time to establish trust and build the relationship.
