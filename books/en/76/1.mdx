title: 1 Money Talks—My Path to Private Equity
---






A couple of years ago I had lunch with some senior executives of Jardine Matheson Holdings on the 48th floor of Jardine House in Hong Kong. Jardines, as it is known, is a British conglomerate founded in Hong Kong with a history dating back more than 180 years. It has interests in everything from aviation and hotels to retail and real estate. The firm's spacious private dining room was decorated with bright and cheerful Chinese paintings and had a breathtaking view of Victoria Harbour.

As my gracious host walked me to the elevator lobby after lunch, I noticed a giant oil painting, darkened with age. It was a portrait of an Indian man wearing a tall black headdress and a long-sleeved robe, cinched at the waist, that appeared to be made of cream-colored silk. He had a dramatic mustache, an enormous potbelly, and eyes that were both keen and kind. He was sitting on a cushioned chair, surrounded by scrolls. He held one in front of himself as if he had just finished reading it. On his chest he wore a large gold medal, signifying some kind of honor. Behind him sitting tall on a pedestal was a giant potbellied brass vase whose exterior bore some barely recognizable letters, which I made out to be CARITAS, a Latin word from which charity in English was derived. I was instantly curious about this man, who looked anything but English, and his prominent place in the head office of a distinctly British company.

“Who's he?” I asked my host.

“His name was Jeejeebhoy, the man who grew opium for us in India, which we shipped and sold to China,” my host replied nonchalantly. It was as if he were talking about someone engaged in selling vegetables.

I later learned that Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, a Bombay native, had amassed a fortune in the British opium trade to China. His “distinguished services” to the British Empire were recognized with a knighthood in 1842 and by a baronetcy conferred upon him by Queen Victoria in 1858, the first ever granted to an Indian.

I was a little surprised by my host's forthrightness. Jardines' historical role in the drug trade was common knowledge, but I thought they'd be more circumspect about it.

“Ah,” I said, “I thought it was an awkward subject to bring up.”

“Nothing awkward,” my host reassured me. “We say Her Majesty's government made us do it. But we aren't drug dealers anymore,” he added with a twinkle in his eyes.

We both laughed. Jeejeebhoy's story hints at Hong Kong's inception as a British colony. Jardine Matheson was one of the original foreign hongs, or trading houses, established in southern China, that engaged in trading goods like tea and cotton among Britain's far-flung colonies. It also had a major interest in smuggling opium into China. Eventually, the Chinese government began seizing and destroying this illegal cargo, so Jardines' principals lobbied the British government to send in gunboats. In the ensuing Opium War (1839–1842), Britain's military forces overpowered the Chinese and forced China to sign the Treaty of Nanking by which, as part of the settlement, China ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain.

Western commerce in the region grew, the opium trade continued, and Britain continued to tighten its grip on the area around Hong Kong. In 1860, Britain annexed the Kowloon Peninsula, directly across Victoria Harbour, the body of water that gave Hong Kong its name. Roughly translated, hong kong means fragrant harbor, but by the mid-19th century, the British had named the harbor for their queen and established it as a center of international trade. In 1898, Britain secured a 99-year lease for the New Territories, a mountainous, mostly rural swath of land surrounding Kowloon that connected it to the mainland of China.

Jardines grew with the colony. The skyscraper I was dining in had been the tallest building in Hong Kong when it was completed in 1972, a testament to the hong's enduring legacy and recognizable for its unique porthole windows. Locals called it the “building of a thousand orifices,” as a BBC documentary on the British Empire delicately put it. “Doubtless, somewhere in the foundation lies buried the conscience of its founders,” deadpanned the narrator.

Hong Kong was still a British colony when my family and I arrived from the United States in 1993. Under British rule, Hong Kong had prospered, attaining a living standard among the highest in the world by the early 1990s.

Located at the southern tip of China, with a land area of about the same size as the city of Los Angeles, it was a laissez-faire market economy, among the freest in the world. As an economic gateway to mainland China, Hong Kong was the regional headquarters to many multinational companies and international financial institutions. From Hong Kong, a business traveler could cover almost all of Asia: Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Bangkok, and Singapore were all less than a four-hour flight away. English was widely spoken, and families of foreign expatriates could live comfortably there. Despite our Chinese background and Hong Kong being a Chinese city, my family and I considered ourselves outsiders. We did not speak or understand the local Cantonese dialect.

Before moving to Hong Kong, for six years we lived in the United States, in Philadelphia, where I was a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The life of an academic at an Ivy League university was comfortable, although it became a little dreary after a few years. American business schools are not exactly ivory towers. Their professors frequently maintain strong ties to the business world, and Wharton had particularly close interactions with Wall Street. While I never felt too removed from the real world of business and finance, I longed for a taste of real action. It seemed a bit ironic that I had been teaching business for so long without having actually done any.

By the early 1990s, China's growth had captured Wall Street's imagination—and I followed developments there with keen interest. At the time my research and teaching were focused largely on the management of multinational corporations and on the biotechnology industry, which had nothing specifically to do with China or Asia. Even so, I had grown up in China during its tumultuous years, so I had an intrinsic connection to the country. (My memoir, Out of the Gobi: My Story of China and America, chronicles my experiences during this turbulent period.) Eventually, I found my way to the United States, where I received a PhD in business administration at the University of California, Berkeley before becoming a professor at Wharton.

Because of my roots I had followed the developments in China with keen interest and I visited the country from time to time. At Wharton, I founded China Economic Review, an academic journal dedicated to researching China's rapidly changing economy and role in the global business landscape. My credentials as a professor at a top business school, combined with my knowledge of the country, were inevitably attractive to some firms with ambitions in the Chinese market. When opportunity knocked on my door, I was ready.

In 1992, I was approached by several major companies involved in management consulting or investment banking. Eventually I decided that the latter, which mainly helps businesses raise capital, was more interesting, and I began to explore related opportunities. In emerging markets, companies grow fast. Businesses tend to be more willing to pay for access to capital than for just knowledge and advice. Money talks, I thought, and at an investment bank, I figured my job would be easier than at a consulting firm.

I was recruited by a tall, shrewd banker named Tad Beczak, then the president of JP Morgan Securities Asia. He took me to a restaurant in New York City for lunch in early 1993. I had expected him to tell me how wonderful it would be to work for his bank. To my surprise, he looked at me across the table with his penetrating eyes and told me, “It's going to be hard.” However, he suggested, I might have what it took to succeed.

I found Beczak to be down-to-earth and straightforward, quite different from the stereotype of a Wall Street banker. He had a good knowledge of the Chinese market, especially its challenges and pitfalls. I took an immediate liking to him—and the prospect of doing something new, even something difficult, excited me.

I was offered a job as vice president in JP Morgan's Hong Kong office, with an additional title: Chief Representative for China. At industrial firms, vice presidents are big shots, but investment banks mint them by the dozen. Knowing this, I did not like the title. Even though I had zero experience in banking, I thought my credentials as a business professor ought to count for something. Eventually I accepted the offer, understanding that I needed to prove myself before getting a more senior position.

My major responsibility at JP Morgan was to get clients, typically large companies, to hire us to raise capital for them by underwriting their initial public offerings (IPOs) in overseas markets, or to provide other financial and advisory services. Underwriting IPOs is extremely lucrative for investment banks. Typically, we charged a fee representing a percentage of the capital raised. If the client raised $1 billion, our 5 percent fee would be $50 million (the actual percentage varied). However, qualified IPO candidates were hard to come by in China, and obtaining the mandate to underwrite their stock offerings was a fiercely competitive business.

When I arrived in Hong Kong in 1993, China was still a poor and developing country. In that year, its gross domestic product (GDP) was only $440 billion, one-sixteenth of that of the United States (about $6.8 trillion) and one-tenth of that of Japan (about $4.4 trillion). China's per capita GDP was only $377, a tiny fraction of that of the United States (more than $26,000) and of Japan ($38,000).

At this early stage of China's economic development, any business of decent size was state-owned. Factories were organized like an extension of the government and reported to certain ministries, such as Ministry of Textiles or Ministry of Machinery. They each functioned like a department of the government. As such, they had to be restructured as joint stock companies before they could be offered to overseas investors. There were only a few IPO candidates, all of which were carefully selected by the Chinese securities regulator. From 1992 to 1994, just 31 companies received approval from the regulator to go public on overseas stock exchanges. Each year there were more foreign banks chasing IPOs than there were IPO candidates.

I soon realized, somewhat to my dismay, that not only was I new to the game, but my employer was as well. JP Morgan had a long history, dating back to 1871. But the House of Morgan had been broken up in the 1930s by the Glass-Steagall Act, split into Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, and JP Morgan, a commercial bank. This set of laws, passed in an attempt to eliminate conditions that had helped cause the bank failures of the Great Depression, restricted a commercial bank to collecting deposits and making loans. It was not until 1989, four years before I joined, that the law was relaxed to permit the likes of JP Morgan to get into investment banking business, albeit in a limited way. In 1993, the bank was still building its investment banking business, and its underwriting capabilities were weaker than those of established houses, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Those competitors were known as bulge-bracket banks because they were listed first, in bold type sizes, on the covers of stock offering documents.

JP Morgan's lack of a track record made it doubly hard for us to market ourselves to clients and compete with our bulge-bracket peers. To add to our difficulties, our pool of potential clients was smaller because JP Morgan was able to underwrite stock offerings only in the U.S. market, but not in Hong Kong, where most Chinese IPO candidates chose to go public. The saving grace was that none of our potential clients knew much about overseas capital markets or foreign investment banks. They were reliant on us to walk them through the process, and we made sure to make ourselves look as good as possible while doing so. As a former professor, I could be quite convincing, helped by the investment bank rankings, or league tables, prepared by my colleagues, who often placed JP Morgan at or close to the top.

Only later did I learn that every investment bank rejiggers these league tables to make itself look better. For example, if a league table showed we were in the top three in underwriting U.S. IPOs for Korean companies, it might mean that out of 100 Korean companies that had gone public in a five-year period, only three chose the U.S. market for their IPO, and in that year the bank was able to do one. To an unsophisticated client, though, being in the top three would seem quite impressive.

However, our competitors had their own league tables, and often a track record of underwriting Chinese IPOs, something we lacked. I found myself unsuited for the job because I could not honestly tell a client we were better qualified than our peers when I did not believe that was the case. I could only try to win their trust by going the extra mile, visiting with them so frequently that I am sure I came across like a type of human superglue. But still, it was an uphill battle, and one that was often too hard to win.

One of the IPO mandates I won was from Dongfeng Motor Company (DFMC), one of the three largest automobile manufacturers in the country. It was located in the middle of nowhere, deep in the mountains, accessible only by a slow train or a narrow dirt road, which zigzagged past steep walls of jutted rocks on one side and deep ravines on the other. The road was so bumpy it felt as if all my bones had been shaken loose after the four-hour ride. It was also so dangerous that a couple of times I saw the smoldering remains of vehicles that had plunged off the road into the ravine. My colleagues and I took this road more than 20 times in 1994 alone. Each time I felt lucky to have made it out in one piece.

DFMC had been built in the 1960s at a time of high tensions between China and the Soviet Union. Its remote location was due to an effort to hide China's industrial assets in remote areas in case of Soviet invasion. Shiyan of Hubei Province, where DFMC was located, was a factory town with its own kindergartens, schools, shops, fire departments, hotels, hospitals, water supply, sewage system, waste disposal, and even funeral homes. Most of these social services were offered to employees and their families for free or for a token price. The original purpose of the factory was not to make a profit but to produce whatever output it was designed for without much regard to economics. It would be my job to prepare it to sell shares to savvy investors around the world.

DFMC's managers and engineers knew a lot about making trucks, but international capital markets were completely foreign to them. In one meeting they told me a story that revealed just how limited their exposure to the rest of the world was. DFMC was negotiating a joint venture with the French automaker Citroën, so the senior management team was invited to France for a visit. Citroën's chairman hosted a dinner for his guests at his home. His wife brought out her best silverware and prepared the finest French cuisine. As her Chinese guests sat down, all of them unfolded their napkins and began wiping their forks and knives in unison. The hostess was stunned: Was her silverware not clean enough? She felt so humiliated that she burst into tears. The Chinese guests were shocked to see their hostess so upset but were completely puzzled as to what had triggered her reaction.

The DFMC managers had all come from Shiyan, the backwater factory town, where sanitary conditions were poor to say the least. Conscious of hygiene, they always wiped their chopsticks and bowls with their handkerchiefs before eating. Normally they would have some boiling water ready to rinse with as well. At the home of the Citroën chairman, they followed their pre-dinner habit. At least they had not asked for a bowl of boiling water to complete their sterilization or they would have killed the joint venture right then and there. In short, DFMC needed help, both with its IPO and its knowledge of customs abroad.

JP Morgan won the mandate to take DFMC public in the United States, but we faced the daunting and complicated task of restructuring the company into a shape recognizable and acceptable to overseas investors. A new joint stock company had to be established. And then decisions had to be made as to what assets to put into it and what to keep out. Needless to say, the new entity had to be profitable, which would mean excluding the factory town's not-for-profit social services and making many workers redundant. It was immediately clear that making the new entity profitable might bankrupt the town. How would the social services be financed? Who would pay for laid-off workers? How should the new entity pay for medical care and retirement benefits for the retained workers and their families, and at what prices? These were questions we would need to answer.

Accounting records were another problem. Most of the documents we needed—typical financial statements and business records—had never been created. Others existed, but only in forms that would be incomprehensible to the market. Pro forma financial accounts going back at least three years had to be created, sometimes nearly from scratch. This required a massive amount of work by accountants, lawyers, and bankers, and the process was both time consuming and resource intensive.

At that time, JP Morgan's client banking operations were country-specific, so its bankers were paid if the mandates they obtained were executed. However, the execution was mostly in the hands of product groups, which were paid for selling securities in the capital markets for clients, regardless of their countries of origin. Naturally, the product groups did not want to execute difficult mandates if they didn't have to. Labor-intensive Chinese deals, while a high priority for client bankers, were usually a low priority for product groups. The product bankers would rather execute straightforward deals from traditional market economies such as South Korea or Indonesia, whose businesses were already organized to issue securities in the public market without much work.

I came to the realization that the only way for the bank to develop its Chinese market was to have China-dedicated product teams. Maybe the business volume did not justify it at the time, but if we could start executing more Chinese business, the need for a specialized team would grow. The business volume would never be there without the initial investment. Maybe it was too early. Maybe the bank would not be competitive until it could present itself as a bulge-bracket bank. In any case, it seemed that JP Morgan never figured out how to tackle China. It shut down its Hong Kong capital markets business in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1998, a year or so after I had left.

The Chinese market was definitely difficult. Quality clients were few and the competition for them was cutthroat. The process of obtaining mandates was opaque, often based not on a team's capabilities and effort but based on connections—or shady quid pro quo. I felt the work was 20 percent financial engineering and 80 percent political engineering. It was frustrating that some hard-fought mandates could not be executed, or were executed so slowly that we missed market windows for IPOs. That was what happened to Dongfeng’s IPO, though the company did manage to finally go public in 2005. I was working my tail off and I was promoted to managing director. But I increasingly disliked my job and felt the elevated title and the work were not worth my personal investment. It was time to make a change, but before I could leave JP Morgan, I had to figure out what to do next.

In mid-September of 1997, I met with Dan Carroll for breakfast, in Hong Kong. Carroll was tall and athletic, with a broad smile and a firm and sincere handshake. He came across as friendly and likable.

Carroll was a partner at Newbridge Capital, a private equity firm. He was only 36 but had worked in private equity for over a dozen years, most recently with a firm called Texas Pacific Group (TPG). Newbridge was a joint venture between TPG, headed by David Bonderman, and Dick Blum, a well-known American investor based in San Francisco. Established in 1994, Newbridge had been set up as a China fund with about $100 million in capital but had expanded its mandate to cover the whole of Asia. Carroll's co–managing partner had recently left, and Newbridge was looking for his replacement.

The only time I had come into contact with the private equity business I hadn't even known what it was called. Shortly after I joined JP Morgan, my boss, Tad Beczak, took me aside and told me that a vice chairman of the bank in New York had asked us to look into the possibility of investing in a China venture called ASIMCO. Since I was supposed to know China, Beczak wanted me to check it out.

U.S.-based ASIMCO had been set up to form joint ventures with various Chinese manufacturers of auto parts. It was looking to raise $400 million, and there was strong interest in Wall Street circles to invest. A colleague from JP Morgan's principal investment department and I took a tour with ASIMCO executives to investigate these potential Chinese joint venture partners. Most of them were under the umbrella of Norinco, the China North Industries Group Corporation. Norinco was primarily a defense contractor, but it also operated a vast array of other businesses, scattered across China. We visited Norinco's headquarters in Beijing and then traveled to a number of provinces to check out its auto parts makers. I was underwhelmed by what I saw. My impression was that almost all of these companies were in trouble, and Norinco was trying to find a way to save them. The proposed investment by ASIMCO seemed a perfect solution from Norinco's point of view, but how ASIMCO could make money out of these auto-parts makers was unclear to me. I wrote a report to summarize my views and, in the end, JP Morgan did not invest.

ASIMCO was able to successfully raise the funds from other sources and eventually lost practically all of the money. In 2006, Tim Clissold, who had worked at ASIMCO as a young analyst, wrote a book called Mr. China, which detailed the near-disastrous experiences of the company. I supposed I helped JP Morgan dodge a bullet.

I still didn't know much about private equity. But a few days after meeting with Carroll, I received a call from the headhunter who had put me in touch with Newbridge. Newbridge wanted to invite me to San Francisco for more interviews. I liked Carroll, but I still did not know what to make of the company, which I had never heard of. I did not think it would be worth it for me to travel all the way to San Francisco to learn more about the job, but I did leave the door open and indicated I would be happy to meet with Newbridge partners when they came to Hong Kong.

On Thursday, October 23, 1997, I took a day off to spend some time with my family. My wife, Bin, and I went shopping in Hong Kong's Times Square, a multistory mall in the bustling shopping area of Causeway Bay. The plaza in front of the mall was dominated by a giant overhead TV screen. On that day, Causeway Bay seemed even more crowded than usual, and I noticed that a large crowd had gathered below the giant TV screen, staring up at it. I looked up to see the stock market tickers scrolling along the bottom of the screen. Every one was showing red. In the middle of the screen was an intraday chart of the Hang Seng Index, which tracked Hong Kong's stock exchange. It was midday, and the Hang Seng was already down more than 1,000 points, nearly 10 percent. Before the day was over, it would fall an astonishing 16 percent.

It had been a difficult few months for Asian stock markets. In July, the devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, had triggered a chain reaction of currency devaluations across the region, from Indonesia to South Korea. Investors were fleeing the market in droves. The cratering of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange meant we were now in a full-blown financial crisis. No company would be able to do an IPO, issue a bond, finance an expansion, or engage in any of the capital-raising activities for which banks like JP Morgan charged hefty fees. For investment banks, the capital markets in Asia would be as good as dead for a while.

Some 10 years later, in 2008, a similar scene would play out in the United States with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the meltdown of the financial markets.

I turned around to see Bin, who usually could not care less about the stock market, staring at the screen. I told her, “I think I am going to join Newbridge Capital.”

“What's Newbridge Capital?” she asked.

I explained to her as much as I knew at that point about private equity. The firm's business was to make investments in companies or assets, improve them, and sell them hopefully at a higher price.

“But why did you suddenly decide to switch jobs?” She was puzzled.

“There will be a long winter for capital markets, and investment banking will be in a deep freeze. There won't be much to do on the sell side,” I said. “It's time to switch to the buy side.”

Investment banking is considered to be on the sell side, selling its products and services to clients and helping clients sell—or market—themselves to investors to raise capital. By contrast, private equity is on the buy side. It is primarily involved in directly acquiring assets and businesses and turning them around. When Asian markets were hot, it was good to be on the sell side because assets and securities were easy to sell. But once the market collapsed, the buy side became more attractive. Cash was king and assets could be acquired at bargain prices. The Asian Financial Crisis brought severe economic pain but with that came rare opportunities for investors like Newbridge Capital. And the Newbridge opportunity instantly felt more interesting and appealing to me.

A couple months later I met with Dick Blum and David Bonderman, Newbridge's co-chairs, in Hong Kong. Blum I had met once before, but it was first time I had met Bonderman, although I knew him by reputation. Both were tall and rather imposing, but they came across as friendly and casual. We had a good conversation, peppered with light jokes, in a relaxed manner. While I thought there were good investment opportunities in China, I talked mainly about the difficulties of the market and all the risks involved for foreign investors. They already knew about all that because most of Newbridge's China investments were struggling by then.

Shortly afterward, Newbridge made me an offer. The cash compensation was not as good as what I could get in investment banking, but I had completely lost interest in that business and almost no offer could have persuaded me to stay. Newbridge's offer included profit sharing, known as carried interest. If the firm made a decent profit for its investors, it would get to keep a percentage of that profit to share among its partners. This was certainly appealing, but with it came the risk that if the firm did not make money for its investors, there would be nothing to share.

Carroll invited me to visit San Francisco, where both TPG and Blum's company, Richard C. Blum & Associates, were based. I arrived in San Francisco a week before Christmas. The next day, after I met with a number of TPG people, Carroll took me to dinner at a nice seafood restaurant. On the menu was a whole steamed crab, a dish for which San Francisco was famous. I knew one rule of business meals was to never order anything that might be messy, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and Carroll seemed too nice a guy to mind. So I had my last interview with him cracking open crab legs and concentrating on not cutting my fingers on the shells.

After the dinner I signed up with Newbridge Capital as a partner and agreed to start work in the new year.

Some time after I joined Newbridge, my new colleague Paul Chen recounted a conversation he had had with Bonderman. After my interview, Chen had asked Bonderman what he thought of me. Bonderman had replied, “This guy has no clue what private equity is about.”

Bonderman was right, of course. A few years later I asked him about it. “If you thought I was clueless,” I said, “why did you hire me?”

“Personalities,” he said, “and I figured you could learn.”

He was right about that. But there was a lot I had to learn.
