title: 7 Presidential Visit

The meeting between Ambassador Hong-choo Hyun and Dick Blum took place in San Francisco on May 24, 1999. My partner Dan Carroll and our advisor Bob Barnum also participated. Blum enjoyed meeting Ambassador Hyun and took an instant liking to him. To our surprise, the ambassador proposed, on behalf of Chairman Lee, a “summit meeting” between Lee and both Blum and Bonderman in June. He insisted the meeting should take place outside of Korea, and Hong Kong seemed to be the most logical and convenient location. I felt encouraged by this request. Ambassador Hyun would not have made the offer unless Chairman Lee was serious about wanting to do a deal with us.

Meanwhile, back in Seoul, Noh requested a meeting with Kunho Cho, the Lehman Brothers chief representative. It seemed that the FSC, having allowed its deadline to lapse, needed some graceful way to come back to us. Instead of communicating directly, however, it sent messages through advisors.

The messages, as per usual, were confusing and conflicted. On one hand, Noh expressed a firm desire to do a deal with Newbridge. “There hadn't been any talks with any other potential bidders” he said. The FSC wanted “to give it a last push before changing the course of action,” Cho told me afterward. “It wants to cross the bridge.”

On the other hand, Noh was dismissive of our latest proposal and said that it still showed a lack of understanding of how business is conducted in Korea. The FSC's biggest concern, he told Cho, was that we would restrict the business activities of KFB's borrowers. This seemed to echo what Woo-choong Kim of Daewoo had told me during our late-night meeting at the Seoul Hilton—that the head of the FSC, Chairman Lee, was concerned that we wanted to get rid of half of KFB's existing borrowers. At the time I'd thought this was because Lee was misinformed or because Noh had simply not told him about our proposal. Now I had no idea what Noh was talking about.

Noh also asked Cho to find out what Newbridge's “bottom line” was. The FSC seemed intent on finding out how much farther it could push us. Cho replied that Newbridge was unwilling and incapable of giving more in terms of economics but that we were flexible to structure certain aspects of the deal to accommodate the needs of the FSC.

When Cho asked what these needs might be, however, Noh turned cagey. He did not have either a counterproposal or formal feedback, he said, because “whatever gets put on paper cannot be taken back.”

Though we had made a great effort to accommodate the FSC with our new covered assets model proposal, Noh saw no change from our previous position, because “Newbridge will continue to have discretion and management power over the loans.” Newbridge wanted the government to protect its downside, but it wasn't willing to take the risks, he complained. Covering the assets for five years was too long. Saying that we were unwilling to budge on economics but flexible on structure was neither consistent nor helpful, he remarked.

In the end, Noh told Cho that we should simply trust the government. “We will not allow this investment to go sour,” he promised.

The messages from the FSC through Laroia of Morgan Stanley, Cho, and others all seemed to tell the same story. The government wanted to engage, but it was not prepared to accept our proposal. It wanted us to come up with a better one.

A few pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place, however. A few days earlier, we had seen a report that Chairman Lee of the FSC would be called to the Blue House to brief President Kim on the status of the Newbridge-KFB deal. Subsequently, I learned that Lee had given his presentation and was also scheduled to meet with an advisory group, the vice ministers council, to make a similar report.

Chairman Lee would not be appearing before the vice ministers without the approval of the president, I was told. While we didn't know what exactly President Kim had approved, we reasoned that Chairman Lee would not have gone to him with a deal he couldn't get done.

Meanwhile, HSBC's talks with the government over Seoul Bank seemed to be on the rocks. The Maeil Business Newspaper (the Korean equivalent of the Wall Street Journal) reported that HSBC and the government were at loggerheads, predictably, over the mark-to-market issue, and that the final close of their deal was expected to be delayed. While the FSC had issued a statement denying the report, I received a call from a Wall Street Journal reporter telling me that the news was in fact true.

There were other movements in the shadows. We'd heard from a reliable source that BS Kang, the FSC director, was growing increasingly frustrated with his boss, Director General Noh. Kang had privately complained that Noh was totally incapable of making decisions, a frustration we'd also heard from the FSC negotiating team. Unfortunately, the same source said, it was impossible for Chairman Lee to make a decision to go ahead with the deal without a recommendation from Noh, since the chairman wasn't involved in the details.

Against this background, I thought it was significant that Chairman Lee wanted to meet with either or both of Newbridge's chairmen. “Given our experiences with him in the past, I know we run the risk of wasting your precious time,” I wrote to Blum and Bonderman. “However, if there is going to be a breakthrough, this seems to be the right time and opportunity. If Lee really wants to sit down to talk, it might be the only chance to make him understand that our proposal does not cause and actually takes care of many of his or the FSC's concerns.”

* * *

Following his curious, if cryptic, meeting with Noh, Cho of Lehman Brothers became a conduit between our team and the FSC—at Noh's request. The director general had told Cho that he found it easier to convey subtleties in Korean. Not wanting to waste what seemed like a good opportunity, we were happy to oblige.

A few days later, Cho met for dinner with Noh's subordinate, Director Kang. Once again, Kang affirmed the FSC's desire to do a deal and that they weren't talking with anyone else. But as government officials, there were certain things they could not do or were afraid of taking responsibility for. Specifically, he said that they could not give us the mark that we proposed on the loan portfolio. Nor could they give us the put right. If we insisted on the mark on the asset side, they had to insist on the mark on the liabilities side. The bottom line would be at par.

Kang did, however, have favorable things to say about Newbridge. After spending so much time together, the FSC team was beginning to like us. Earlier, they thought we were taking advantage of them or scheming against them. Now, they knew we were being fairly honest and straightforward. In contrast, Kang told Cho, the FSC team was now angry with the HSBC for having backtracked from its earlier positions.

Later that week, we also got a bit more information on what had transpired between Chairman Lee and President Kim. According to our sources, Lee reported to the president that the FSC thought Newbridge's proposal of May 11 (covered asset model) looked promising and that it was an improvement from the MOU. Lee further suggested that the Newbridge deal would have an impact on the HSBC deal and that therefore the FSC needed to drive the hardest possible bargain with Newbridge. Finally, he informed the president that it was unavoidable that the government would have to inject another 3 trillion won (nearly $2.5 billion) into KFB to keep it afloat, but such a move would have no effect on the negotiation with Newbridge.

“I think it is very clear from all the hard evidence that they very much intend to do a deal,” I wrote to Blum and Bonderman on May 26. “It is equally clear that they do not know how good a deal they can get. Therefore, they keep trying to test our bottom line.” I felt that the ball would start to roll even faster when Noh, Kang, and Chairman Lee finally realized that we indeed had no further concessions to give, other than moving pieces around.

* * *

Cho met with Noh again a couple days later, on May 27. The two sides were still far apart on specifics. The FSC's complaints were the same as before: that the put right would adversely affect KFB's biggest customers and that Newbridge stood to make unfair and excessive returns from the deal. Cho's response was also the same. Our proposal of May 11 (the covered assets model) was final, and the FSC should make a decision. Noh said that he was disappointed but that the FSC would come back to Newbridge with a counterproposal. Noh's last comment was “Take that as a sign of sincere interest to do a deal.”

The same day I received a bit of useful intelligence from Kevin Honan, the economic counselor at the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Ambassador, Steve Bosworth, had arranged a meeting with Chairman Lee of the FSC to discuss the latest news regarding the two bank deals.

Ambassador Bosworth told the chairman that he was concerned about the effect on reforms if both deals fell through. Lee reassured him that both deals were still alive. Lee thought Newbridge now understood the FSC's concerns.

Lee was still worried about the optics, however. He knew the press was going to come after him when the deal was done, and he needed to prove that whatever agreement he'd reached was for the good of Korea and its people. He also wanted the deal to close as soon as possible, because he worried that it was going to be difficult to go back to the market and find another buyer.

He was also concerned that if KFB classified a loan differently from other banks, then other banks would follow suit regarding the same borrower. That would create trouble for both the customer and other banks. Further, the five-year arrangement under our covered assets model proposal would create moral hazard, Lee suggested, presumably in the sense that we would have no incentive to collect loans if they were guaranteed by the government.

“We will resume discussion soon,” he told the ambassador.

Newbridge had a fine reputation, Ambassador Bosworth assured Lee, and had turned around many companies. Newbridge should be fully capable of turning around Korea First Bank.

* * *

On May 30, we received a request from the FSC team through its advisor Morgan Stanley to meet at 10:30 am on Tuesday, June 1, to discuss our most recent proposal. This would not be a negotiating session, they cautioned, and asked us not to mention this meeting to the press. It was the first direct meeting between our two sides since May 11, nearly three weeks earlier. Short Guy reported exuberantly that, according to his contacts, a deal along the lines of our last proposal would be done within the week. At this point, I didn't give that much credence.

The week began with some ominous signs. An FSC spokesperson was quoted in the English-language press, although not in the Korean press, saying that the FSC would give Newbridge a counterproposal—one that specifically disregarded the terms of the MOU—and, if Newbridge rejected it, the government would walk away. “FSC Will Give Newbridge an Ultimatum” read the headline in the Korea Herald. The Yonhap news service quoted another FSC official as saying that the government would guarantee the loans for no more than two years, but they have to be marked at book value.

When we arrived in the meeting room at FSC headquarters Tuesday morning, however, the atmosphere was quite different. On our side were Paul Chen and me from Newbridge and Mike O'Hanlon and David Kim from Lehman. On the other were BS Kang and Junior Lee.

The FSC team had quite a few questions about our most recent proposals, which seemed to indicate that they were taking them seriously. They also had what I judged to be legitimate concerns, which fell into four main categories.

Their first concern was the five-year window. Under our covered assets model proposal, the government would guarantee the yield and interest for five years on all the loans KFB decided to keep. The FSC side was concerned (a) that the government might not be able to set up a facility at the end of those five years to manage the loans KFB didn't want and (b) whether that time frame was going to be too long for the government to risk. While some loans may indeed improve in value as the economy recovered, they pointed out, loans otherwise classified as normal at the end of two years might actually deteriorate over the next three, increasing the risk to the government.

Their second concern was the 96 percent mark. We needed the markdown to give the loan portfolio sufficient yield even if it was guaranteed by the government under the covered assets model. But the government negotiators still considered the 96 percent mark too big.

The third source of contention was Newbridge's return on investment. The government, probably sensitive to public perception, worried that we stood to make too much money on this deal. They proposed to cap Newbridge's return on equity at 25 percent.

Finally, the buy/sell arrangement was another complication for the FSC. We explained how it would work again and the rationale behind it. One party would name the price of the asset to be put, and the other party would decide whether to buy or sell the asset at that price. The FSC decided to table the issue for further discussion.

Afterward, I saw Ambassador Hyun to get his take on the meeting and to finalize plans for the summit meeting in Hong Kong between Chairman Lee, Dick Blum, and David Bonderman, which was scheduled for the following week. The ambassador thought the negative press reflected the weakness of the FSC's position, if anything, and Chairman Lee seemed by all accounts to want to do the deal.

I told him that we continued to talk with the country's politicians and opinion leaders in our effort to win their support. “Don't say too much, but provide them with punch lines and pithy quotes,” Hyun advised. I very much appreciated his wisdom.

The chairman's visit was going full steam ahead.

It was certainly encouraging that President DJ Kim seemed strongly motivated to restructure Korea's banking system and retool the economy, and was exerting pressure on officials to carry out his policies. On June 4, he stated emphatically, in a meeting with foreign bankers, “we will sell Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank to foreign investors.” Such a public statement was quite unusual and only put more pressure on the FSC. Two opposing forces were at work, and Newbridge's KFB deal was at the crux of this tug-of-war.

The week, which had started out so ominously, ended with some positive news coverage. Chosun Ilbo quoted a senior FSC official as saying that Newbridge's new proposal was more workable. The remaining issue was the duration of the yield protection. It further said that the interest rate yield protection in our proposal required neither marking to market of the loans nor additional reserves, which would reduce the taxpayers' burden.

The summit meeting took place on Tuesday, June 8, 1999, at the Island Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong. At about 5:30 that morning I went out for a run on Bowen Road, a quiet running trail near our home. Bowen Road hugs the side of Victoria Peak about halfway up, meandering across the steep, green sides of the mountain and offering panoramic views over the city's skyscrapers and high-rises. When I was about halfway through, it began to rain heavily. By the time I finished my run, I was soaked with sweat and rain.

I arrived at the Shangri-La at 8 am and met with the team to brief Blum and Bonderman on the key points of our proposal and the major points of contention with the FSC team, which we hoped the chairmen would resolve. It was a full house. Bob Barnum was there, as were Mike O'Hanlon from Lehman and Dan Carroll, Paul Chen, and Daniel Poon from Newbridge.

Shortly afterward, Chairman Lee came down to the hotel's business center, where we were waiting. Blum, Bonderman, and Ambassador Hyun went into the meeting room to meet with Chairman Lee. The rest of us waited in an adjacent room. From time to time Bonderman came out to consult with us on some issues and deal points.

At about noon the meeting was adjourned and Lee left for the airport. Bonderman wrote up his notes from the meeting and confirmed them with Ambassador Hyun. In typical Bonderman style, they were brief and to the point:

Meeting Minutes: June 8, 1999, Hong Kong

Discussion:

KFB portfolio to be divided into three pools: non-performing [loans], as determined by Korean Government (“NPL”)

performing loans as determined by Newbridge (“PL”)

all others, termed “gray area” loans





NPLs taken by Government; PLs marked to 96 [percent of book value] and kept by KFB; gray area loans marked to 94 [percent of book value] and subject to paragraph 3

“Gray area” loans treated as follows: with respect to all workout loans and any other loans with maturity longer than 2 years for a period of 3 years if there is a payment default, loan can be put to the Government; and

if during this period additional provisioning is required by [Financial Supervisory Services] guidelines as applied by agreed-upon third party, Government will pay for provisioning by a receivable [i.e., an IOU] to be monetized [i.e., paid down by cash] at the end of the period





with respect to all other “gray area” loans, they are treated as in (a) but with a two-year period





Concentration of chaebol loans will either be excluded from new regulations or KFB otherwise protected from regulatory default on pre-existing loan concentration. [This was to accommodate new regulations that would limit the concentration of loans or exposure by a bank to a specific chaebol; KFB's legacy chaebol loans would be grandfathered in.]

Returns, if any, to the parties will be determined by the market. Korean Government will not guarantee Investors any minimum or maximum return.



Note: Mark on NPLs and PLs subject to further discussion.



Afterward, the Newbridge team had lunch with Ambassador Hyun in the hotel, and we all felt encouraged by the progress we'd made. The framework outlined by Chairman Lee and agreed to by both sides seemed like a positive, workable agreement and was consistent with the covered assets model proposal we'd suggested.

Our optimism proved premature.

* * *

That afternoon, my family and I, along with Blum and a few others, flew to Bali in Blum's private jet, to attend Newbridge's annual investors' conference. Bali, an idyllic island in the Indonesian archipelago, was known for its beaches, surfing, and laid-back culture. Unfortunately, I wasn't going to enjoy much of any of those on this trip.

At the conference, held in the ball room of a grand hotel, which overlooked the sparkling blue ocean, our investors were keen to hear everything we could tell them about the much-publicized KFB deal. I made a presentation on the deal's status, using a few cartoons to illustrate the difficulties of our negotiations and break the ice. KFB was often depicted as an unwed or undesirable Korean bride with Newbridge as a disappointed suitor (Exhibit 4).

The cartoons lightened everyone's mood, but there were still plenty of questions as to how good a deal we would be able to cut and what the chances were that the deal would happen. Finally, Bonderman spoke up. We did not have total confidence the deal would come together, he said, but if it did, we were sure we could turn the bank around.

In the middle of our conference, I received a fax from BS Kang at the FSC, containing a new proposal from the government side. I read it with growing astonishment.

The FSC's new proposal bore no resemblance to what Chairman Lee proposed in Hong Kong. Specifically, it would cap our return on invested capital at 12 percent, would eliminate any mark on the loans by treating them all at full face value, and would eliminate our right to put bad loans back to the government. If the terms Lee proposed in Hong Kong were a step forward, the FSC's new proposal was 10 steps back. It was both puzzling and infuriating.

On June 10, I wrote a letter to Ambassador Hyun, who was now our main conduit of communication with the top at the FSC, outlining our position and our reaction to the newest proposal from the FSC:

I hope that you understand that both Dick and David were quite upset and disturbed by the proposal we received. Not only does it not reflect any of the discussion and understanding with Chairman Lee, it represents a major step back from FSC's own proposal of April 27 on MTM [mark-to-market] and put right. April 27 proposal was a step back from the FSC's March 16's one and the new one retreats even further from April 27's! They ought to know their proposal is simply economically not viable. It does raise the question of whether or not the FSC is genuinely interested in doing a deal, or if it simply wishes to provoke us. Many of our advisors now tell us that the bureaucracy does not really wish to do a deal although President DJ Kim remains firmly committed to reforms of the banking sector. Squeezed between a rock and a hard place, they say, the bureaucracy is simply buying time. We have doubted this theory for a long time, but it seems that the evidence is not on our side.

You, of course, can best advise us, especially Dick and David, if that is the case. What I am most afraid of is that their patience, and that of our shareholders, is running out, as we continue to spend our resources and time on this deal without seeming to get closer to agreement. They find it difficult to understand how the directives of Chairman Lee, a cabinet member, can be disregarded by his own staff, and that the FSC does not seem to be able to recognize a very good deal when they have one, especially compared with the other deal [i.e., HSBC's]. All this stretches our credulity. We have always believed that this transaction is good for all the stakeholders, the government, taxpayers, the bank, customers and investors. We do not want to get into a lose-lose situation as our investors will not allow us to quietly walk away after having expended so many resources on this transaction, having relied on an explicit understanding with the government. We desire a win-win situation. We have worked hard hoping to win the trust of the staff of the FSC and we wish to work closely with them, now and in the future. However, we do not see how this deal can get done if the FSC does not even honor the words of its own chairman. So, the question is, does it have the political will to do a deal?

Ambassador Hyun, all of us highly respect and trust you. Your words carry heavy weight with Dick and David. I very much appreciate your advice, which I know will significantly influence our thinking and the decision-making process.



I received a call from Ambassador Hyun on June 11. He said: “I spoke with Chairman Lee after I received your message, and asked him what was the meaning of all this. I said to him, ‘This is backtracking from your own proposal. It is against the understanding you had with Chairmen Blum and Bonderman in Hong Kong. The Newbridge people are puzzled. I am puzzled too.’”

Lee's response was that some points needed to be clarified, and that he wanted to talk further with Newbridge, Hyun told me. However, Lee asked that we not send a formal response to the “working-level people,” meaning Noh and the FSC negotiators. He wanted Newbridge to communicate directly to him, through the ambassador.

“I think, although he might have a different understanding on some points from the Hong Kong meeting, he still wants to handle this in good faith,” Hyun advised me. “I don't see a major reason for concern, and I don't detect anything that indicates he doesn't want to deal in good faith. Please give him all your thoughts in a detailed manner in a letter, and we will proceed from there.”

I also received a call from David Kim, who told me that the collective advice of the Lehman team—Kunho Cho, Mike O'Hanlon, and himself—was to avoid sending a point-by-point response, as it would only dignify FSC's latest proposal, and give them another month to get back to us.

Following this advice, I refrained from responding directly to the FSC counterproposal. Instead, I drafted a letter from Blum and Bonderman to Chairman Lee. After reviewing and making some revisions, Bonderman sent it on June 15:

Dear Chairman Lee,

We were encouraged by the progress we achieved in our meeting with you and Ambassador Hyun on Tuesday, June 8, 1999. We continue to believe that the suggestions you made as embodied in the discussion memorandum circulated after the meeting (copy attached) can be the basis of a successful conclusion of our negotiations with respect to Korea First. We were, therefore, profoundly surprised by the nature of the letter received by our colleagues from Director [BS Kang] dated June 9, 1999. [Director Kang]’s letter did not appear to us to reflect any of your suggestions embodied in the discussion memorandum or in our conversations with you and Ambassador Hyun the preceding day. Indeed, the letter from [Director Kang] of June 9 not only contradicts the very items you proposed in our meeting in material respects, but also retreats in significant ways from major items offered by the FSC in its past proposals. A brief summary of these differences is attached for your perusal. Accordingly, we don't believe it would be productive to re-engage in an item-for-item re-argument of the issues raised by [Director Kang]’s June 9 letter. However, since we continue to believe … in the importance of completing the transaction we are negotiating, we remain open to using your proposal as set forth in the June 8 meeting memorandum as the basis of finalizing our negotiations. To that end, we suggest that those proposals, together with certain of the items and conditions that we submitted to the FSC on May 13, form the basis of our continued discussion. We are, of course, willing to meet again with you and Ambassador Hyun in order to finalize our agreement.



* * *

At this point, I really did not know what to make of it. Did Chairman Lee instruct his people at the FSC how to take the deal forward or did he not? Why was his message so completely different from his own team's?

I decided to step up our own public relations campaign. On the morning of June 14, I sent a brief note to Michael Schuman of the Wall Street Journal to update him of the deal. The next day, the Journal published an article under his byline: “US Firm Hits New Snag in Bid for Korean Bank.” It read in part:

SEOUL – The troubled acquisition of a nationalized bank by U.S. investment firm Newbridge Capital Ltd. hit a major setback as a new proposal from the South Korean government widened the gap between the two sides.

The new proposal, said a Newbridge executive, backtracks from the government's earlier positions on the method of valuing Korea First Bank's assets and the right of Newbridge to sell nonperforming loans to the government in the future. These issues have been among the main sticking points in the negotiations.

“It raises the question of whether they want to do the deal at all,” said the Newbridge executive, who still expressed optimism that the acquisition will be completed.



The FSC could tell immediately that we were the source of this story, but I did not mind. I wanted to set the record straight. The FSC team had been using the local press to put pressure on us, and I had been working hard to undo these misunderstandings. It was difficult to get the Korean press to write anything sympathetic toward us, nor was it possible to ensure accuracy of local newspaper reports. But the government also cared about international opinion, and I knew we could rely on the professionalism of the journalists at the Wall Street Journal and other foreign media outlets to accurately report our message and the facts.

I spoke with several other reporters that week. They told me that the HSBC team had been encouraging them to write negative stories about the Newbridge/KFB deal. I laughed it off but thought it was quite sneaky of them to advance their own cause at our expense, even as they tried hard to hide their own troubles in their negotiations with the government. I could not imagine that Newbridge would do the same to any of our competitors. We, ironically and maybe somewhat naïvely, believed in the English spirit of fair play.

After the Newbridge meeting in Bali, I returned to Seoul with our team members. We met with the FSC team on June 17. By then they had learned about the content of the minutes of the June 8 meeting, although I suspected they did not know where the meeting had taken place or who had led the discussion, in view of Chairman Lee's desire to keep the summit a secret.

After the meeting, O'Hanlon and Cho of Lehman went to talk with Noh, because he had asked to talk to the Newbridge advisors only. At the meeting, the director general told the Lehman team three times that they should persuade Newbridge to accept the government's proposal. It was as if he sensed a willingness on our part to start negotiating with ourselves again and couldn't resist the urge to push us. Ambassador Hyun, who also spoke with Noh that day, said to me that he had emphasized to the director general that Newbridge was already at its limit and was about to abandon the deal. He told me that Noh seemed surprised to hear it.

* * *

The following day, Ambassador Hyun faxed me a copy of a letter from the FSC chairman, Hun-jai Lee. It was addressed to Hyun but clearly intended as a response to Blum and Bonderman. In the letter, Lee denied that he had agreed to the terms contained in the minutes of June 8 chairmen’s meeting, suggesting that these were only points raised by Blum and Bonderman. He said that he had not endorsed the plan to put certain loans into a gray bucket. Then he urged us to consider and respond to the June 9 proposal from Director Kang.

I found it bizarre that Chairman Lee disavowed his own proposals at the June 8 summit in Hong Kong as if it had never taken place. Instead, he endorsed Kang's proposal, which Bonderman, in his letter to Lee, had already rejected because it represented a retreat from the FSC's previous proposals. In fact, each of the FSC's three proposals to date was progressively worse. It seemed as if negotiating with the FSC team was like nailing water to the wall—as soon as we tried to accommodate them, the government side moved farther and farther away.

After sharing the letter with us, Hyun called Lee again and asked him point blank if he thought the deal was doable.

“I really want to close this deal,” the chairman replied. He seemed as committed to the deal as he had ever been, Hyun told me afterward, and it seemed that Lee thought there were no major differences between Newbridge's position and the government's. However, Lee told Hyun to ask us to try to come closer to the FSC's position, if we could.

In light of Lee's letter, I felt we had no choice but to let the FSC team know our own position on the various issues Lee raised. However, Hyun had another idea.

Hyun's advice was that, while we should make sure we got our point across, we should consider making our term sheet look as much like the FSC's documents as possible. By using their format, we would give them the impression that we had taken their proposal seriously, and it could help narrow the perceived gap between us. We should also refrain from using any new terminology or introducing any new concepts in our communications. As a case in point, he noted the FSC's strong response to the term “gray area.” “Try to use their vocabulary,” Hyun advised.

I thought the ambassador's advice was excellent. He was, after all, a veteran diplomat, and he knew how to make the other side feel good without bending his principles. Also, despite Chairman Lee's apparent amnesia regarding our summit in Hong Kong, I had to admit that the tone of our recent negotiations with the FSC had been more positive.

The ambassador believed Chairman Lee wanted to negotiate in good faith and pointed to the big difference between Lee and his own people in their desire to do this deal. The ambassador also believed Chairman Lee might be open to another chairman-to-chairman meeting. Over the next few days, we put together a revised term sheet in line with the ambassador's recommendations, and refined it further on the back of a long discussion with him and his colleagues from Kim & Chang. They suggested several changes that would not affect our economics but would make the term sheet appear more accommodating to the FSC's sensitivities. Regarding their concern that putting loans into a gray-area bucket might send a signal to the market that the borrower was in trouble, we proposed a compromise: Eliminate the “gray” pool entirely, and mark all the loans to be retained by KFB after the close of the deal at 95 percent of the face value, which was the middle point between 94 percent for nonperforming loans and 96 percent for performing loans as discussed in the June 8 meeting.

We sent the document to the FSC on June 23. “This term sheet reflects the discussions we have had with the FSC and represents the best Newbridge can do in terms of economics in an effort to close this deal,” I wrote in the conclusion. “We would be happy to have detailed discussions with the FSC on the basis of this term sheet.”

Meanwhile, Kunho Cho, who was still acting as intermediary between our team and the FSC, got an update from BS Kang on the internal differences within the FSC over dinner.

Kang told Cho, confidentially, that he felt Noh was a major obstacle to the deal, and that he was also fed up with Noh. As long as Noh continued to filter the information Chairman Lee received, the deal was going nowhere. The only way to get it done, Kang believed, was to go around Noh directly to Lee. He advised Cho to request another summit meeting with the chairman. After both sides had put so much time and resources into getting this far, Kang and his team all wanted to see it through.

Noh again, I thought. The issue kept coming back to the director general. His boss had to go around him to make anything happen. Now his subordinates wanted us to go around him as well. The deal was being supported by the negotiating party on the other side, the chairman of the FSC, and the president of the country, but we couldn't make any progress because the man who occupied a critical position in the bureaucracy was either unwilling or incapable of pushing it forward. No wonder everyone was frustrated with him. It seemed he only knew how to say no.

Another piece of useful information brought back by Cho from his dinner was Kang's confirmation that HSBC had put its own deal in a holding pattern, waiting to see what was going to happen with the KFB deal. According to Kang, because the HSBC deal was worse for the investor than the Newbridge deal, HSBC would like to use the KFB deal as a benchmark.

* * *

By the middle of 1999, the economic outlook for South Korea had begun to brighten considerably. This was good for the country but did not bode well for our deal. The government was on the verge of officially revising its projected growth rate for the year to a higher-than-expected 6 percent. The Korea Asset Management Corporation, the government-owned bad bank, was selling nonperforming loans to foreign investors at more than 50 cents on the dollar, up from about 20 cents just a few months earlier, reflecting a surge in investor confidence. The stock market was rising. And all of that meant there was much less motivation on the part of the Korean government to close the Newbridge deal.

On June 23, the Wall Street Journal carried an interview with Korea's new finance minister, Bong-kyun Kang. As if to confirm my fears, Kang said, “The terms for the now-delayed sale of two banks to foreign investors should reflect improvements in Korea's economic outlook since the deals were first discussed.” The next day, the paper published an article entitled “HSBC May Not Buy Stake in Seoul Bank amid Signs of Improvement in Economy.” The recent economic growth numbers had prompted a rethink of the FSC's bargaining position, the article noted, “leaving the government to conclude that perhaps there was no need to offer dramatic concessions to lure outside buyers.”

For some reason, however, there seemed to be a renewed sense of urgency on the part of the FSC to make progress. The day after I read Kang's interview in the Journal, I learned that Chairman Lee wanted to meet with us and had asked his team to give him a report on the status of negotiations as soon as possible. Lee seemed to want to make some sort of decision over the weekend. It seemed that Lee needed us to meet with the FSC team to discuss our latest term sheet.

It was already Thursday, so I left for the airport as soon as I was able to get a flight from Hong Kong to Seoul.

The meeting with the FSC went surprisingly well. The FSC team raised a few questions and made some suggestions that I thought were constructive. They also seemed to have come around to our position on the 95 percent mark on the loan portfolio, which had been a sticking point, although they stopped short of explicitly accepting our proposed mark.

Still, I was cautious. Politically it was a sensitive time in South Korea. The United States had just announced that President Kim would visit President Bill Clinton in the White House in early July, amid a resurgence of tensions between North and South Koreas. Although much of their discussion was expected to revolve around Seoul's belligerent neighbor to the north, it was also well understood that the Clinton administration was dissatisfied with the pace of South Korea's economic reforms. It was possible that the overtures from the FSC were just an attempt to buy President Kim some good publicity. “If so,” I wrote to my colleagues, “then today's meeting does feel too good to be real.”

Regardless of what was driving this new sense of urgency, I felt encouraged that the FSC and Chairman Lee himself were actively engaging with us. I had always thought our deal was good for the government. All it took was the political will to get it done. But the political opposition within the government could not be underestimated. There was always a force pulling in the other direction.

That Sunday, back in Hong Kong, I learned that Lee had no major issues with the deal on the table, but he wanted three things. First, he wanted Newbridge to accept the Korean standard for assessing whether a loan was in default. We had specified a 90-day delinquency period, while Lee wanted 180 days. Second, Lee wanted us to improve the mark on the loans. Third, he wanted to cap the return on equity KFB could make at 25 percent.

I called Bonderman to discuss the proposal. This was one of those times when a fax wouldn't do.

Both of us thought that the first issue was an easy give.

On the second issue, initially Bonderman did not agree to improve the loan mark. I persuaded him that we could improve the mark from 95 percent to 96 percent, provided that if the loan was put to the government, KFB would get to keep the 3.5 percent loan reserves. This would effectively reduce the mark to closer to where we wanted it to be.

Bonderman also agreed to cap the return on equity at 25 percent for KFB. Even though he conceded this point, in my heart, I did not like it. I considered it unfair, and I planned to not yield on it unless absolutely necessary. However, the return on equity for the bank was not the same thing as the rate of return on equity for Newbridge. If KFB made an ROE of 25 percent, which was considered exceedingly high, we would be able to sell the bank for multiples of our investment cost. Still, did the FSC understand that distinction? I wasn't sure. The best strategy, in my view, was not to agree to the notion at all.

I flew back to Seoul the next day, Monday, June 28. On the flight, I drafted a note to the FSC. In the note I emphasized that we had already given the government 5 percent warrants in accordance with the MOU, which would allow it to capture more upside than its shareholding, more than what Newbridge would get. Therefore, we would not agree to cap the return on equity or on sharing any further upside with the government.

The next day, I went to the office of Kim & Chang, and met with Ambassador Hyun and two of his partners, Byung-moo “BM” Park and Kye-Sung “KS” Chung, both of whom would also work with us on the deal. Since seeing my memo of the day before, Hyun had already been in discussions with Lee, who thought that, as the warrant was already in the MOU, it should not be considered a concession. Furthermore, he wanted to cap the return on equity to about 16 to 17 percent and wanted no markdown on the loans, although he agreed that the government would provide reserves for the loans and would take over any loans in default.

June 30 was a day of intensive negotiations. Ambassador Hyun negotiated with Chairman Lee by phone on our behalf, and Lee had to call back three or four times as he was interrupted by other matters of urgency. President Kim was scheduled to visit the United States on July 1 and 2. The FSC had already leaked to the press that the Newbridge/KFB deal would be concluded before the visit. Lee was personally involved in all our negotiations, and he had also spoken with the press to send a few signals that the deal was imminent. It was now or never, I thought to myself. We had to seize the moment.

Lee proposed that Newbridge invest $600 million over the next two years in exchange for a greater percentage of shares, which I had no problem with. He pushed for us to accept no markdown on the loans but eventually relented, although he insisted that the mark should be 96.5 percent, no less. And he offered that we did not have to accept his mark until all other issues were resolved. At the end of the day, though, those other issues were still outstanding.

Thursday, July 1, was a holiday in Hong Kong, and my family had escaped the city's muggy summer heat with a vacation to the United States while I stayed behind. I could not tear myself away from the negotiations in Korea, so I decided to stay in Seoul to continue the negotiations, as did my colleague Paul Chen.

We all felt it was critical to get a deal done before the end of the day on July 1. President Kim and President Clinton were scheduled to meet on that day in Washington, DC, which was 13 hours behind Seoul, and it was clear that Chairman Lee wanted the deal done before the two leaders shook hands. We were afraid if we could not reach a deal by then, there would be no political pressure on the part of the FSC to do a deal any time soon.

Bonderman faxed me a memo overnight, which I received the first thing in the morning on July 1. “It is time to get this done now, if it is going to get done,” he wrote. Now there were four issues left to resolve—and we had one day left to pull something off.

I went over Bonderman's memo, which included his thoughts on the four remaining issues:

Mark. I think we can live with 96.5 if you agree that it is time to hit the bid tomorrow if Lee does not move.

Capital Contribution. I think your proposal works.

Government Support. You have to continue to adhere to our position. I would trade Lee [points] one and two for this one.

Upside sharing. I gather this is off the table, which is good.



To summarize, you should try very hard to reach a deal with Lee tomorrow. Four is off the table, stand fast on three and hit his bid on 1 and 2 if you have to.



We were ready and we were in gear. The moment we had been working so hard for had arrived.

I spent all morning of July 1 negotiating with Chairman Lee through Ambassador Hyun again, by phone. We reached agreement on the capital contribution of $600 million over the next two years. As for the markdown figure, I told Hyun it should be 94 percent now, because the capital base was now bigger. However, I would accept 96 percent. I thought I would hold out on this point until all other issues were resolved. Lee no longer insisted on the cap on the return on equity or upside sharing, nor was there any further argument on issues related to the government support. I felt a deal was in striking distance. I called Daniel Poon, who had left for holiday, and asked him to cut short his trip and join us in anticipation of working overnight to finalize the term sheet.

In the afternoon, I continued to negotiate with Chairman Lee until all major issues were resolved. Meanwhile, Paul Chen and the rest of our team were at the FSC office, negotiating with Director Kang. Much to my surprise and dismay, the more they negotiated, the more issues popped up. With the sun setting in Seoul and about to rise in Washington, the team reported there were 18 unresolved issues between them.

I was still with Ambassador Hyun at Kim & Chang's offices, but I hurried over to the FSC to join our team, arriving at around 6 pm. I was surprised again by how smooth the negotiation progressed after I got there. In slightly more than an hour, we were able to reach agreement on all the remaining issues. Seeing the deal was in hand, all of us, including the FSC team, were visibly delighted.

I rushed back to Kim & Chang to update Ambassador Hyun. I told him that I could agree to Lee's proposed mark of 96.5 percent. Lee had said earlier that I did not have to agree to that figure until I was satisfied that all other issues were resolved. Now that they seemed to be resolved, I was ready to hit his bid on the 96.5 percent, as Bonderman had suggested.

That evening I sent Bonderman a memo that said “Verbally, we have a deal.”

I had asked Ambassador Hyun to relay a message to Chairman Lee that we would not agree to make an official statement before a binding term sheet was signed. Now we were in a rush to produce that sheet, incorporating all the agreed-upon terms, and send it to the FSC team. “The hope is that we can sign it tomorrow. But I do not know if it is possible,” I wrote to Bonderman. “Details will be in the draft term sheet which will be faxed to you overnight. I will write tomorrow.”

Although we had told Chairman Lee in no uncertain terms that we would not agree to a deal announcement without a signed term sheet, all the major Korean newspapers reported on July 2 that Newbridge had reached agreement with the government on the KFB deal, in time for President Kim's meeting with President Clinton. Lee was quoted as saying that the two parties had reached agreement on all major issues. He also said many kind words about Newbridge.

For the first time, the FSC team moved faster than we did. They sent us their version of the term sheet in the morning. We weren't able to send ours out until that afternoon. I had a quick phone conversation with one of the FSC's Morgan Stanley advisors to tell him where our version of the term sheet and the FSC's version disagreed. After we sent over our term sheet, I called him again to say that we could meet in Kim & Chang's office in an hour to discuss the final proposal.

Just when I thought we were down to the short strokes, I received a call from Ambassador Hyun.

“We have a problem,” he said.
