title: 11 Ultimatum
---






September 4 was a Saturday. I thought I could take a short break, but it turned out to be impossible. To prepare for the next day's meeting with Chairman Lee at the Shilla Hotel, Hyun and I checked out the hotel's meeting facilities. Eventually, we decided to use the conference room in its business center.

I went to the office of Kim & Chang and wrote a three-page briefing outlining our stance on various issues. The intended audience was not only the FSC but also the Blue House, which had requested an update on Newbridge's position. Kim & Chang was in a unique position. It was Newbridge's legal counsel, but it was also trusted by the government, which, knowing Kim & Chang was our counsel, also often requested help from the firm. This arrangement suited us, as we trusted Kim & Chang's professional integrity—especially that of Ambassador Hyun—and were comfortable its lawyers would keep our confidence. We had come to see the firm as an important bridge between the government and Newbridge.

On Sunday, at 1 pm Seoul time, all the members of our team had a conference call to discuss the remaining issues in preparation for my meeting with Chairman Lee later that afternoon. Many thorny issues had been resolved by then, including the agreement, on July 1, on the markdown of 96.5 percent on the retained loan portfolio. The remaining issues were few but no less important. After much internal debate and analysis, Bonderman decided to accept Lee's proposal on the government note: half the payment would be in the form of a government note and half would be in cash. This would be a major and costly compromise. KFB needed interest-earning assets to match its interest-paying liabilities; it would lose money until the cash could be lent out to creditworthy borrowers, which were scarce in an economic crisis. We also accepted Lee's position on the risk weight of the government-guaranteed loans. But on employee reduction, Bonderman insisted that we stick to our guns.

At 4:15 pm, Lee called Ambassador Hyun. Eric Yoon, the White & Case lawyer, strongly objected to the language on indemnification, binding effect, drag-along, and God knew what else. Given the fact that the gap on the remaining issues was so large, Lee did not think it worthwhile for him to meet with me. He asked that I meet with Noh and Yoon instead.

I could not believe that Lee had gone back on his word again, just as I thought a deal was within reach. I considered his suggestion to meet with Noh and Yoon a pussy-footed way to say no, because he knew all too well it was impossible for us to make any progress with those two. I refused.

Perplexed, Hyun went to meet with Chairman Lee at his FSC office to urge him to keep the meeting. Lee relented and called me in to discuss. We met for about two and a half hours, but given the bad start, the meeting was tense. Meanwhile, our lawyers from Kim & Chang met with the FSC negotiators, including Noh and Yoon, in another conference room on a different floor.

Based on my earlier call with Bonderman, I offered up our two major concessions. On risk weight, I told Lee that it was in the government's best interest that KFB's loans carry the appropriate risk weight and that the risk weighting of government-guaranteed loans should be zero since they were risk-free. In spite of that argument, I said we would not insist, and we would concede to his wishes.

On the government note, I accepted Lee's position that KFB would be paid half in the government note and half in cash. Incredibly, instead of being pleased, Lee retorted that he would consider it. I replied that we were accepting his proposal and it was a major concession on our part. At the end of the meeting, we agreed that Newbridge would prepare yet another draft of the terms of investment, which Lee wanted to receive by midday on Monday.

Before we could ready that draft, Noh’s team sent its comments on a paper, “Agreed-Upon Issues,” which the Kim & Chang lawyers had prepared at Lee's request. Eric Yoon's response was titled “So-Called Agreed-Upon Issues by K&C.” In it, Yoon basically contradicted everything Lee and I had agreed upon. According to Yoon's version of events, we did not have an agreement on the language for drag-along right, or indemnification (he clearly wanted none), the investment amount (he wanted us to commit to additional investments), due care (he rejected our side letter), and a host of other issues. While I doubted Lee and Newbridge would ever agree on everything, I was convinced that we could have no deal if the FSC continued to accept advice from Yoon on commercial, as opposed to legal, issues.

“Although we have very few open issues left, my feeling is that we are further apart than ever before,” I wrote Bonderman that evening. “It seems whatever Lee agrees is subject to subversion by Yoon, his team, and himself. Therefore, I have no idea if what we consider open issues are the only ones.”

The next morning, I talked with Bonderman by phone. He questioned whether the deal was still worth it, in view of all the changes and concessions we had made.

“Let's take a step back to look at the big picture,” he said. “This might be death by a thousand cuts.”

I called Mike O'Hanlon of Lehman and asked him to run our model again using the latest terms, to see if the deal still worked for us economically. My feeling was that fundamentally, it did, even with the recent concessions, but we had to verify this by looking at the numbers.

Based on the outcome of my negotiation with Lee, Linda Matlack at Cleary had worked the whole night to revise the terms.

During this process we discovered a bit of good news: The question of employee reduction, which was a major remaining issue, turned out, upon closer examination, not to be a major issue after all. Our consultant, Bain & Company, which was examining KFB's operations and management for us, had estimated the cost of these headcount reductions to be anywhere between $55 million and $70 million, and we were at loggerheads with the government over who would cover these costs.

However, every company in Korea was legally required to maintain a funded pension, earmarked for each individual employee. On September 6, BM Park at Kim & Chang pointed out that the “legal severance package” was in fact the same thing as “the funded reserves” already on the bank's balance sheet—thereby eliminating the need for either the government or Newbridge to fund severance anew, except if we wished to pay more than legally required. I thought we definitely should pay more than legally required to better take care of these employees who had sacrificed a lot during the financial crisis. Such generosity would also help build goodwill with the employees we retained.

The last time KFB had implemented a voluntary reduction program like the one we'd hoped to use, it had paid out an extra eight months' salary, which had averaged out to less than $10,000 per person. Running the numbers, even if we tripled the payout (which Bain recommended, and was considered extraordinarily generous), we would only be talking about $9 million, which was far less than our working assumption. Just in case, I suggested that we go back to the FSC and ask it to provide KFB with approximately $20 million in additional reserves to pay for the 300 Class 4 employee reductions we had in mind. It seemed that the last major issue between us and the FSC had become manageable.

BM Park proved to be a major force on the Kim & Chang team, and it was insights like this that had made him so. Only 38 years old, he was already a partner at the largest and most renowned law firm in South Korea.

Square-jawed and bespectacled, BM always appeared to be relaxed, but he was meticulous and worked at a relentless pace. Not only was he familiar with the law, but he was also a good and effective problem solver.

The next day, I went to the Blue House to meet with the president's Senior Secretary for Policy and Planning, Han-gil Kim. Kunho Cho of Lehman helped translate. Kim listened carefully to my report and requested that I provide a position paper. He said that he would review it, report it to the president, and get instructions from the Blue House to pass along to the FSC. He said that the official communication channel remained to the FSC but President Kim and the Blue House were very committed to this deal. To my remark that we had 24 hours to bring this process to a conclusion, he asked for more time. I said that I would so report to our chairmen and thanked him for his support.

I was quite encouraged by this meeting, and went back immediately to start putting together the position paper the senior secretary had requested. I felt we had to push every button we could to move the process forward, including applying political pressure. I felt that Chairman Lee needed not only political pressure but also political support to make up his mind to do the deal with us. As the process had dragged on endlessly, I would have been more than happy to stop the political campaign if he would move to complete the deal with us.

Meanwhile, Ambassador Hyun met on our behalf with Lee for an hour, followed by several phone conversations. Lee again raised questions about the language on drag-along, indemnity, the binding effect of the TOI document, and the investment amount, because his lawyer Yoon had raised them. But to me those issues were closed. Another meeting was scheduled for Chairman Lee and me at 9 am the next day. Before our meeting, I learned from our sources that he had expressed some anger over my Blue House meeting, complaining it was distracting at this critical juncture, but he was not so upset that he changed our plans to meet as scheduled. It now seemed to me that Lee was making a serious effort.

The next morning, September 7, I met with Chairman Lee again, but only for five minutes. Ambassador Hyun, his partner KS Chung, and I had gone to meet with him at the Federation of Banks building, but Lee met only with the ambassador, while Chung and I waited in an adjacent room. The lawyers at Kim & Chang had prepared a folder of documents, which included copies of contracts for other American banking deals showing that indemnification was a common feature. Hyun told me afterward that Lee had called the FSC director, BS Kang, to say that he thought our indemnification clause looked logical and reasonable and challenged his team to give reasons for their objection. Kang replied with something about hidden liabilities, and Lee retorted that was exactly why investors wanted this. In spite of his siding with us on this issue, however, Lee did not immediately agree with our indemnification language. I was sure his lawyer would object strenuously.

Lee remained firm on the employee issue, insisting that the government could be responsible for management reduction of only up to 100 people (this was down from the 150 he had suggested on Sunday). He seemed to be receptive to the idea of additional reserves to pay for extra severance, however. His stance on the language of drag-along and binding effect seemed to have become ambiguous.

Lee came out to meet with me briefly and appeared to be much more relaxed than he had been for the past week or so. He said he wanted to get the deal done that day. He also complained about my meeting at the Blue House the day before and reminded me that he, Lee, was the only one who could make a decision on this deal. Nobody, not even the president, could influence him. I replied that I definitely respected his authority and would very much like to concentrate on completing the deal with him.

BM Park and KS Chung of Kim & Chang went to talk with the government side at 2:30 pm and called later that afternoon to say that they were making slow progress. Meanwhile, I went to the Blue House for the second time in as many days to meet with President Kim's senior press secretary. He listened carefully and asked me a couple of questions. He assured us that the president was very committed to doing this deal.

At about ten that night, Chung and Park returned to the Shilla Hotel, where the ambassador, Chen, Poon, David Kim, and I were waiting for them. The deal was 99 percent negotiated, they told us triumphantly.

However, as they laid out what had been negotiated, we realized that a number of unresolved issues remained. Soon, Chen and the lawyers were arguing with each other over what had and hadn't been decided.

Around one o'clock in the morning, Hyun and I adjourned the meeting. There were just too many issues to be resolved that night.

After we got up, Chen, Poon, and I went to Kim & Chang's offices to go over the remaining issues that Chung and Park had brought back from their meeting with the government side. We spent the whole morning formulating our position on the various points, all of which were technical but critical in the context of the deal.

Bonderman, a lawyer by training, was careful with language. When Ambassador Hyun persuaded Chairman Lee to accept our drag-along right, it was understood that such a right would allow us to maximize shareholders' value—to extract the best price from a buyer seeking to acquire 100 percent ownership of the bank. The government side wanted the language to read that the drag-along right's “purpose is to maximize shareholders' value.” Bonderman insisted that the language should be changed to say that its “purpose is to enable the maximization of shareholders' value.”

The difference was subtle but important. We did not want to give the government an excuse to argue in the future that Newbridge had failed to meet an obligation to maximize shareholders' value, since there was no objective measurement as to what “maximize” meant. If I had said “The purpose of wearing shoes is to run at my top speed,” someone might argue I wasn't running fast enough. But if I said “The purpose of wearing shoes is to enable me to run at my top speed,” the purpose was only to enable me, but not necessarily to obligate me, to do so. Given the dynamics of the negotiations, we had to be extremely careful with every word in an agreement so as not to leave room for misinterpretation in the future.

On the afternoon of September 8, Chung and Park went back to negotiate with the government side on our behalf. Ambassador Hyun and I waited in his office for their return. After several hours, they called to report: no progress. Toward evening, I received a call from a senior presidential aide I knew well. He admonished me for visiting with senior officials of the Blue House. He asked me to stop my lobbying with the Blue House, as it was distracting. I respected him and his advice highly, but at that juncture, I was determined to remain annoying until we had signed a binding document, although I kept this thought to myself. While the negotiations dragged on, the ambassador remained optimistic. He suggested that I prepare a draft announcement for the signing of the legally binding TOI with the government. I was skeptical but did as he requested.

The next day, Hyun went to meet with Chairman Lee at about 10 am, spending about an hour there. Lee raised only three issues. First was regarding the initial investment. Our language was “Newbridge intends, but is not obligated, to invest 500 billion won.” He asked that we remove “but is not obligated” from the sentence. Second, regarding the drag-along right, he wanted us to remove the words “to enable” from the sentence stating that “the purpose is to enable maximization of shareholders' value.” Third, the government would provide 30 billion won for the purpose of employee reduction, but Newbridge would be responsible for its implementation.

I called Bonderman to get his views. He was agreeable to the first and third points but would not yield on the second. On the third point, although Bonderman was agreeable to Lee's position, I thought the sum of 30 billion won might be insufficient and we needed 40 billion won. After much back-and-forth, Lee agreed to 38 billion won, which was close enough to my goal.

Resolving the question of that single word, “enable,” proved much tougher than I had anticipated. Incredibly, I spent three or four hours arguing with the government side over the retention or removal of the word. Finally, around 6 pm Seoul time, I proposed a compromise that the government could live with. We would keep the word “enable,” saying “the purpose is to enable maximization of shareholders' value,” but add “and in exercising this right, the investors will seek to achieve this purpose.” My thinking was that “seek” meant to make an effort, but it was not an obligation.

Since this was a point on which Bonderman was insistent, I called him, at what must have been 5 am in New York City, where he was, to check if he was agreeable to my proposed wording. Bonderman had an amazing ability to take a call at any hour. Even if awoken from a deep sleep, he talked and thought with total clarity, as if he were on standby and had been waiting for the call. The only time he would not answer in the middle of the night was when he was at home. I usually called at odd hours only when necessary and when I knew he was traveling.

Usually, Bonderman would give quick, unhesitating answers. This time he was silent for almost a full minute. If I had not known him better, I would have thought he had gone back to sleep. I knew it was an important point, so I waited patiently for him to think through the implications of my proposed language. Finally, he said, “I am okay with it” and rang off.

Bonderman once told me that he was able to go right back to sleep after taking a call. I am a light sleeper. If someone wakes me in the middle of the night, my sleep is ruined. I could not believe it was so easy for him.

It had been another long day. At about eleven-thirty that night, I finally left Kim & Chang's offices and returned to the hotel. I was about to brush my teeth and dive into bed, feeling pleased for having made some progress, when the phone rang. Ambassador Hyun said that he, Chung, and Park wanted to come to the hotel to meet with me. I hung up the phone and closed my eyes for a catnap before their arrival, sensing this would be a long night. No sooner did I fall asleep than the ambassador called to let me know he was en route, and Chung and Park were on their way as well. I went to meet with Hyun in the business center. While waiting for Chung and Park, Hyun and I chatted to pass time.

Like most educated men of his generation, Hyun could write beautiful Chinese calligraphy (Exhibit 5). That night, as our wide-ranging conversation wandered to Korea's history and I lamented not being able to find good Korean history books, he wrote down a list of ancient books for me: The History of Three Kingdoms [of Korea], The Saved History of Three Kingdoms [of Korea], The History of Goryeo (“Goryeo” is the name that “Korea” is derived from), and The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. All the ancient books of Korea were written in Chinese, and therefore I would have no trouble reading them, although unfortunately the younger generation of Koreans no longer can, because the teaching of hanja, or Chinese characters, had been phased out in South Korea since the early 1970s.

The night wore on without word from Chung and Park, who had been painstakingly negotiating with a senior government official designated by Chairman Lee at a location inside the Blue House. Ambassador Hyun and I were both exhausted. Eventually, he fell asleep on a sofa. I lay on another sofa but could not sleep a wink. Chung and Park finally showed up at 4 am. I woke up Daniel Poon in his hotel room and asked him to come downstairs to join the debriefing.

The Blue House official wanted to revise the language on a number of terms, some of which I found acceptable but others not. It was too early to wake up our legal and financial advisors in Seoul to consult with them, so I called Linda Matlack of Cleary in Washington, DC, and David Jackson of Lehman in New York, to discuss the proposed changes with them. We decided to accept some but pushed back on others. With some back-and-forth between the Kim & Chang lawyers and the Blue House official, the gap between us was narrowing.

By daybreak, it seemed we had almost closed the gap entirely, until Ambassador Hyun received a call from Chairman Lee. The chairman expressed surprise about the binding nature of the TOI and said he was disturbed about the absence of a mutual breakup fee. The ambassador became uncharacteristically upset, because we all knew the binding nature of this document had been agreed to, after a long and strenuous negotiation process. The last-minute change came as a shock. We flatly refused to negotiate further on this point. Half an hour later, Lee's office called the ambassador's office twice to request an “all-hands” meeting at 4 pm. I refused to attend it unless there was some assurance that the document would be signed, but instructed Kim & Chang to deliver three copies of the final document and side letters with a cover letter reading “Enclosed for your signature.” The ambassador did not attend either.

Shortly after the meeting began, Lee called the ambassador and apologized for having “forgotten” about the discussion on the binding nature of the TOI. At this, Hyun agreed to attend the meeting, joining Chung and Park. On the other side were Lee, the Blue House official, Director General Noh, and Yoon the lawyer. Lee presided over the meeting and asked everyone to raise issues or be silent from then on. Yoon immediately took issue with the “binding” issue, Hyun told me later, and Lee told him to “forget about it.” As the Kim & Chang lawyers went through the TOI, explaining our positions on whatever points they had raised, Noh said nothing.

Afterward, Lee met with Ambassador Hyun to say that the decision was to have the TOI signed on either Monday or Tuesday, when President DJ Kim would be flying back to Korea from the APEC summit meeting in New Zealand, where he and President Clinton were scheduled to meet again. The idea was not to make an announcement prior to the meeting, fearing the public would criticize the administration for having buckled under pressure in advance of the meeting with Clinton.

It was a Friday, so I was heading to Hong Kong to spend a weekend with my family. On my way to the airport, Bonderman called and I updated him on where things stood. “Well, if it doesn't happen, it isn't your fault,” he said. “If it does happen, it's your fault.” I laughed and said it would be my fault either way.

I was relieved to be home. The next morning, I went for a run and came home in time to see my daughter, LeeAnn, just waking up. But I did not get to spend much quality time with her as we were soon interrupted by repeated phone calls from Seoul. BS Kang, the FSC director, had called Kunho Cho at Lehman early that morning with big news.

“It's a done deal,” Kang had told Cho. The TOI would be signed early next week. Major local newspapers were also reporting that the deal was imminent. Ambassador Hyun called me that afternoon to say that the FSC wanted the signing to take place on either Tuesday or Wednesday. Lee and his team raised a couple of minor issues, but we made it clear that Newbridge would not negotiate any more.

The ambassador said that Lee had requested a meeting with me as soon as possible, suggesting Monday afternoon, which Hyun expected would largely be ceremonial, a coda to the negotiation on the TOI.

I spent the rest of the day drafting an official announcement with the Lehman team. They wanted to make a big deal of it, and I agreed. We needed to impress upon the Korean public that this was a done deal, so that no one, either within or outside the government, would second-guess us as we negotiated the definitive documents.

We arranged for our advisor, Bob Barnum, and my partner, Dan Carroll, who would be traveling in Asia that week, to join the rest of our team in Seoul for the official announcement. We intended a show of force, to make an impression on the Koreans.

“It ain't over until it is over,” I wrote to Blum and Bonderman on Saturday evening. “This deal has seen enough ups and downs. I am now cautiously optimistic. Let us keep our fingers crossed.”

Even though I was trying not to get anyone's hopes up, most of all my own, I was relieved that there was finally light at the end of the tunnel. I had not slept well for a long time, although I did not feel tired. Now that it seemed all was set, I must have subconsciously let myself relax. My daughter's bed was on a raised platform, half of which was for her bedding and the other half a play area. That Sunday morning, I was lying on her bed to play with her as she sat beside me. Usually, I cannot sleep if there is the slightest noise, but I fell into a deep slumber, despite the noise my daughter was making playing right by me. When I woke up, the room was quiet and it was already two-thirty in the afternoon. I could not believe that I had slept for two and a half hours in broad daylight.

On Monday morning, September 13, I took the first Cathay Pacific flight to Seoul and went straight to the offices of Kim & Chang to meet with Ambassador Hyun, Chung, and Park. Hyun said that he met with Chairman Lee earlier in the day and that Lee still had five issues. Over lunch, we discussed them and decided that Hyun should meet with Lee to explain that Newbridge would not entertain any further changes. Lee could either accept the last version of the TOI or the negotiations were finished. Coincidentally, a fax from Bonderman had arrived while I was en route to Seoul. It was a short, handwritten note that read:

Shan –

I got your most recent fax. You are completely out of your mind to keep discussing word changes. Stop Now. Our position is no more conversations pre-signing, period. There will still be definitive documents to argue about later and word changes can be fought over then.



His note (Exhibit 6) reminded me of a Chinese saying, “The tree wants to be motionless, but the wind just doesn't stop.” I too wanted to stop. But I could not stymie every attempt by the government side, and I could not refuse to speak with them.

The next day, Barnum, Carroll, and James Chang, another Newbridge colleague, arrived in Seoul early in the morning. Paul Chen and Daniel Poon had flown in the night before. They were all here to take part in the signing. We went to Lehman's office to review the Lehman team's financial analysis of KFB, based on the negotiated terms of the deal. I knew that Ambassador Hyun was meeting Chairman Lee at 10 am, and I was restless waiting to hear from him. At about noon, Hyun called and asked me to meet him at his office.

He told me that Lee would not yield on the issues he had raised the day before. In addition, Lee did not feel comfortable with a number of other items in the current document. I was very disturbed by this last-minute turn of events, and I informed Hyun I had no desire to negotiate further. It seemed to me that Lee still had no intention of bringing the negotiation to a close, even though earlier he had indicated that signing was imminent. I said I would immediately return to Hong Kong if there was no deal.

I went back to the hotel and briefed our team, most of whom agreed that the best course of action was to decamp from Seoul. Now that there was nothing left to do, I went to my room and fell asleep, since I had slept very little the previous night. I woke up at about five in the afternoon, to a voice message from Hyun. He said that Lee decided to give up most of the issues on his earlier list, although he was still insisting on two technical ones.

Now that Chairman Lee had shown a willingness to compromise, we decided to make another effort to accommodate him, and discussed our response amongst ourselves until about 2 am, when I called Bonderman to discuss the changes and get his consent.

I went to bed at 3:30 am but, after a grand total of two and a half hours of sleep, was up again at about 6. I felt like death warmed over. I reviewed the revised TOI and then drafted a note to explain where we made changes and why. Dated September 15, the note was addressed to Ambassador Hyun:

Dear Ambassador,

I note the message from Chairman Lee on the various issues yesterday. As indicated, we would be willing to make one more effort to close the deal on the basis of the communication. After working with my team until 3:30 am today, we have been able to accommodate most of the requests. However, there are other issues [on which] we cannot change our positions because we believe our positions are fair, reasonable and logical. We have tried our very best, again, in the hope of closing the deal. To avoid any misunderstanding, I am writing this note to explain the various changes (or non-changes). Please share this note with Chairman Lee….



I wrote in conclusion:

This list is as complete as I can tell. Please let me know if I have missed anything. As you are aware, I have truly and completely exhausted all the efforts to be accommodative and will not be in a position to concede any further.



It was Wednesday, September 15. Since this was the day on which we expected to mark the signing of the TOI, every member of our team except me was in a suit and a tie. I hadn't gotten much sleep, nor did I think there was any hope of signing on that day, so I wore shorts and must have looked totally disheveled.

The night before, Bonderman had made a request. He wanted us to sign the revised TOI unilaterally and send it over to the FSC chairman with a cover letter, giving the government 24 hours to sign it or we would withdraw from the transaction.

His request put me in a bind. I thought if we sent a signed TOI to Chairman Lee, he would view it as an ultimatum. Even if he wanted to do the deal, he probably would not be able to, lest he be perceived as having caved in to foreign investors under duress. Even in the best-case scenario, he would be forced to wait until after the ultimatum expired to respond. I was afraid such a letter would be counterproductive. Yet all of us had run out of patience, and there was no way I could persuade Bonderman to change his mind. I called Hyun.

“Ambassador Hyun,” I said, “I have a letter from David Bonderman to Chairman Lee to give him 24 hours to sign the TOI or we would walk.”

Hyun responded with alarm. “Mr. Shan, that would be disastrous,” he warned. “The government can't be perceived to cave to an ultimatum. It's really not necessary.”

“Ambassador, I fully understand, and I'm on the same page,” I said. “But I don't think David can be persuaded at this point. Nor do we have time. I'll send you his letter, but I'll leave it to you to decide what to do with it.”

The ambassador immediately got it. “You think you can ignore Bonderman's instruction?” he asked.

“I am not ignoring it,” I answered. “I am faxing the letter to you.” Then I added, “When the general is out in the battlefield, the emperor's decree need not be followed.” It was a well-known ancient Chinese adage, which the ambassador would be familiar with and would understand.

My colleague Paul Chen, ever alert, knew I had reservations about Bonderman's ultimatum and suspected I might be plotting some way of evading his instructions. At that point, not only Bonderman, but everyone on our team thought enough was enough. To avoid needless internal argument, I asked Chen to fax Bonderman's letter to the ambassador.

Ambassador Hyun never forwarded Bonderman's letter. But I was sure that, in his own diplomatic way, he conveyed to Chairman Lee the message that it was now or never.

We waited and waited. There was no response from the FSC; they fell completely silent. It was getting late and nothing was likely to happen. It appeared that Chairman Lee had changed his mind again.

In the afternoon, after having waited long enough, Carroll and the rest of our team left Seoul in Blum's private plane. They had come all the way to Seoul for the signing, only to leave empty-handed. I decided to stay to see what would happen next. But nothing did, and all was quiet for the rest of September 15.

By that time, all emotions seemed drained from me. I knew we had done everything humanly possible. I thought, “Man proposes, God disposes,” as the saying goes. There was nothing more I could do. Therefore, I was totally relaxed as I waited to see what would happen next.

At about midnight, just when I was about to go to bed, I learned that the Korean government still had some issues with our revised TOI. That call ruined my sleep for yet another night.

The next day, Thursday, September 16, I wrote a memo entitled “Safe: What is going on….” After apologizing to the team for radio silence over the past few days, I provided a summary of the events since last Saturday. Then I reported:

Ambassador called me around midnight last night to say that Lee was “disappointed and discouraged” after having reviewed our final TOI and Mr. Chin of the Blue House expressed similar sentiment. I said that was too bad but there was nothing we could do about it. I asked Ambassador to urge Mr. Lee to look at the big picture, how far he has come from the MOU, do not be a prisoner of himself focusing on a few minor issues, behave like a statesman for a change and make a final decision.



Despite the continued silence from the FSC, I was relaxed. I felt that we had done everything we could, and it was up to Chairman Lee to make the final decision. That afternoon, I took a nap and then met with a reporter, Sue Chang of Bridge News, who visited with me at the hotel. I had built a good relationship with a number of journalists during this deal, and she was one of them. Typically, I stayed at the Shilla Hotel, but this time I could only get a room at Seoul's Grand Hyatt. We sat by the pool chatting, but it was not an interview and I did not give any indication of where we were in our negotiation with the FSC. I still had no idea what the FSC would do, even at this late stage, in view of repeated disappointments in the past months.

By 5:30 pm, there was still no word. I had spent another day waiting in vain. There was nothing further I could do in Seoul. I could not bear to wait around anymore, not knowing what to expect. If Chairman Lee wanted to do the deal, I would have already heard from him by now.

I decided to leave town. But Hong Kong was in the grip of another typhoon. The number 10 signal, the strongest level, had been hoisted, and all flights in and out of the city were canceled. I decided to go to Beijing, only about a two-hour flight away, to attend to some business there. If necessary, I could return to Seoul on short notice.

It was 6 pm when I checked out of the hotel. Leaning back and closing my eyes in the backseat of the car as it pulled out of the hotel's driveway, I felt a tinge of regret that we had come such a long way but the deal remained elusive. I took out my mobile phone to dial Ambassador Hyun's number, to tell him I was leaving town. At that exact moment, my phone rang, quite loudly, startling me. It was him.

“Ambassador Hyun. I was just about to call you,” I said. “I am on my way to the airport to take the next flight out.”

“Mr. Shan, you must not go to the airport. Please don't leave,” he said. I could sense some anxiety in his voice. “Please come to my office immediately. I will debrief you when you get here.”
