title: 4 New Faces at the Table
---






As reporters say, we made great copy. The announcement of the deal touched off a media frenzy. Not only was the timing of our agreement dramatic, coming as it did on the last day of the year, but it also catapulted Newbridge to prominence from relative obscurity. Some just did not believe that a relatively unknown private equity firm could have outmaneuvered HSBC, one of the largest banks in the world, to accomplish such a feat.

Among those who apparently did not believe it was a reporter for the New York Times, who filed a dispatch, dated January 1, 1999, giving credit to GE Capital as KFB's lead investor: “The South Korean Government signed an agreement today to sell a controlling stake in Korea First Bank to a consortium led by GE Capital, the world's largest nonbank financial services company, and Newbridge Capital.”

The reporter clearly hadn't done any fact checking. While we had originally proposed bringing in GE Capital as a way to build credibility with the FSC, we ultimately did not include it in the deal. The New York Times reporter probably presumed that only some big, well-known company could pull off a deal like this one.

News of Newbridge's deal was splashed across the front pages of all the major Korean and English newspapers. Many foreign investors considered it risky and adventurous to invest in a failed bank in the middle of a financial crisis with no end in sight. Others called to congratulate us. The deal had certainly put us on the map.

The Wall Street Journal editorial board hailed the deal as a “bold stroke” on the part of the Korean government. “Triumphant Pragmatism in Seoul” read the headline. It congratulated the Korean government for its courage:

[I]f the new owners turn Korea First Bank around the government's 49% stake could end up being worth far more … than the 94% it now holds. That prospect ought to please taxpayers who coughed up for the recapitalization. It was difficult to put a price tag on the value of good publicity and the amount of money a smooth Korea First deal might attract into Korea in the form of other investments.

The Korea First Bank deal is a bellwether…. No doubt the government is bracing for some kind of tempest, though the press and public outcry may not be so loud as it would have been a year ago. And to those wailing about Seoul giving away the “crown jewels” here: Listen, Korea First Bank ain't no jewel. But now it has a chance to become one.



The government must have felt like a bowl of fried ice cream. The warm reactions toward the deal in the international financial community outside Korea contrasted sharply with the ice-cold sentiments held by domestic critics.

Only with hindsight could I fully appreciate the extent to which nationalistic sentiment influenced the government's attitude and approach to the deal. The effects of the financial crisis, and the subsequent imposition of IMF austerity measures, were humiliating. The sale of one of its largest financial institutions to foreigners was a high-profile target for public anger. The attacks against the government came swiftly. It had made “too many concessions,” according to an article in the Korea Times on January 5, including “[agreeing] to shoulder the burden of additional bad loans to take place over the next two years.”

But while the deal itself might have met with some skepticism, the reaction of the international community was impossible for Koreans to ignore. The MOU was a strong vote of confidence in the Korean economy, and the knock-on effect on investor sentiment was immediate. On the first working day of 1999, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on Korea to “positive” and signaled a possible upgrade of Korea's sovereign credit rating. Among the reasons it cited was the KFB deal: “The completion of the Korea First Bank sale, coupled with the expected government divestiture of Seoul Bank, should mark a turning point in resuscitating Korea's weakened banking sector,” S&P said, citing the MOU as an indicator of the government's willingness to embark on “sweeping structural reforms.”

The upgrades were a big help to a country still in the grip of the financial crisis and would lower the government's borrowing costs in international markets.

The positive reporting by foreign press started to turn the tide of public opinion. Both the Wall Street Journal editorial and the S&P announcement were translated and carried in all major Korean newspapers, bolstering the government's position and to some extent silencing its critics.

The announcement of the deal also brought competitors out of the woodwork. About a week later, our advisor Jihong Kim told me there were as many as five new bidders who had stepped forward, including the representative of one major bank who had approached a KFB director and told him it would have bought the bank outright if it had been offered the same terms we had negotiated.

What a difference a week made. While we had helped improve investors' sentiment toward the Korean economy, the renewed interest, perversely, did not bode well for our own deal. Although we were pleased to have beaten the competition to sign the MOU, we all were keenly aware that, while it laid out the major terms of our investment in KFB, it was not legally binding. Much needed to be done to nail down the transaction. And, all of a sudden, there were other suitors in line. David Bonderman warned it was critically important to finalize the project by May 2, when the exclusivity period would end. Otherwise, the government might be tempted to renegotiate.

Paul Chen, Daniel Poon, and I had dinner with Dong-soo Chin, head of the FSC's Financial Restructuring Task Force, and his deputy Dr. Sung-hun Kim, the FSC's chief negotiator. They had news: Chin was going to be promoted to work in the Blue House, the office of Korea's president. Someone else would replace him as the head of the task force. I was sorry to see him leave but I was happy for him. He had earned my respect as a reasonable, fair-minded, practical, and dedicated government official.

* * *

I first set foot in KFB headquarters on January 6, 1999, a sunny winter day with the temperature hovering just above freezing. Though I had been negotiating for this bank for months, I had not visited it until now. KFB headquarters was a 22-story building in the Jongno-gu district in the center of Seoul. Built in 1987, it reminded me a bit of the United Nations building in New York City. Although it was not quite as big, it was broad and imposing, with a white stone façade framing tinted windows. The KFB logo, a big red thumbs-up sign, was perched atop the building, visible from miles away.

We were yet to finalize the formal contract, but as I walked through the enormous, high-ceilinged lobby, I already felt like an owner, on behalf of Newbridge Capital, of course. We were warmly welcomed by Shee-yuel Ryoo, the bank's government-appointed chairman and CEO, and his senior staff. Ryoo was a white-haired gentleman in his late 60s. He greeted me with the air of an embattled general who was glad to see reinforcements arrive. Educated in the United States with a degree from Columbia University, he spoke fluent English.

At that point KFB was severely hampered by a lack of capital. A number of its major customers had simply stopped making payments, including Kia Motors and companies affiliated with Daewoo Group. The bank had only stayed afloat thanks to occasional injections of funds from the government.

After being put in charge of the bank in 1997, Ryoo had hired Andersen Consulting to produce a restructuring plan. He downsized the bank, cutting the workforce from about 9,000 to about 4,000 and shutting down a number of money-losing branches. He also slashed management salaries by 30 percent and staff salaries by 10 percent. To improve the bank's lending and risk management practices, Ryoo had formed a 10-person credit review committee, of which he was not a member, to independently review loans. This kind of independent decision making on credit was standard in more advanced markets, but it was almost unheard of in Korea, where management almost always had the final word. As a result, Ryoo told us, the bank had begun to generate income from operations in the last two months of 1998, even though the economy was far from being stabilized.

I took an immediate liking to Ryoo. I was impressed with the actions he had taken to improve the bank, given the circumstances in which he found it. I could imagine the pain and suffering its employees were going through and the sacrifices they were making. When Newbridge's MOU was announced, Ryoo had told his staff, “The sale to a foreign investor is the only course left for the bank to be reborn.” He and other employees were looking forward to a new life under a new foreign owner. They were eager for a change for the better.

Chairman Ryoo graciously offered us a whole floor in KFB's headquarters building to use as our temporary offices while we worked on the transaction. We needed the space. For a deal of this nature, Newbridge would need to engage a small army of advisors, working on everything from documentation to financial modeling to evaluating good and bad loans to legal and regulatory issues.

Lehman was tasked with helping us build financial models and advise on valuing the bank's assets. E&Y, one of the world's leading accounting firms, would lead our efforts to mark to market the bank's assets, which meant determining how much they were worth in the current market. It sent an initial team of between 60 and 80 Korean-speaking professionals, bolstered by a team of analysts from Samjong Houlihan Lokey, an asset valuation specialist. Bain, the consulting company, was to examine KFB's operations and management to diagnose any problems we needed to address after taking control. On the legal side, we continued to use Cleary and also retained Kim & Chang, the most prominent law firm in Korea, to help us navigate the local laws. In total, there were probably more than 100 professionals working with Newbridge on the transaction.

On the afternoon of January 19, 1999, we assembled representatives from all parties for an organizational meeting at KFB. Paul Chen, who was more experienced in private equity than I was, presided. He and Daniel Poon led the execution of the deal, while my main responsibility was to lead the negotiations with the government. For more than two hours, we went over the scope of the project, our timetable, and the responsibilities of each of the parties. To keep tabs on everyone's progress, all the parties were required to be present or call in every Tuesday and Thursday for coordinating meetings. Our floor at KFB was like a factory, with piles of paper and teams of people working day and night.

The officials from the FSC did not seem to share our sense of urgency. It wasn't until two weeks after I'd first set foot in KFB's offices that we were able to organize an official negotiating session.

On January 20, 1999, Dick Blum flew to Seoul with Dan Carroll. We brought him to visit with Chairman Ryoo at KFB's offices, where we sat through a management presentation and then had lunch together. The next day, Blum, Carroll, Jihong Kim, and I went to the FSC building in Yeouido to visit with Chairman Lee. It was a courtesy call. Each side thanked the other for the conclusion of the MOU and pledged to work as hard as possible to make progress.

During that meeting we were met with an entirely new team on the Korean side, led by So-woo Noh (not his real name), a director general in the FSC, and his deputy Director Bo-sung Kang, also known as BS Kang (not his real name).

Noh and Kang were linked by school ties, which are very important in Korea for being part of the “old boys' network.” Both were graduates of the elite Kyunggi High School, Korea's most prestigious school for boys. Both went on to study economics at Seoul National University, one of the most competitive programs at the best university in South Korea. Many senior government officials, including Chairman Lee, were graduates of these two elite schools.

The change in personnel concerned me. After months of negotiating I understood and had grown accustomed to the chain of command across the table: Dr. Kim had reported to Director General Chin, who in turn reported to Chairman Lee. As far as I could tell, Kim had Chin's confidence and trust, and Chin in turn enjoyed the confidence and trust of the chairman.

Now, however, Chin had moved to the Blue House, and Dr. Kim had apparently been sidelined. I never knew whether Dr. Kim had been forced out or stepped aside voluntarily, but he was no longer the FSC's lead negotiator and, some weeks later, would leave the organization entirely. It was the first indication that opposition to the Newbridge agreement might not be confined solely to newspaper headlines. There was a little more than three months left in our four-month exclusivity period, and the May 2 deadline began to feel tight. We would need to start from scratch to establish rapport with the FSC's new negotiating team, and that would take time.

We tried to negotiate with the new FSC team on the specifics of the contract, based on the MOU. But the new team seemed ill-prepared and not particularly interested in the terms of the MOU. They seemed reluctant to even engage with us. Unlike Chin and Dr. Kim, whom I could talk with at any time, Messrs. Noh and Kang remained somewhat aloof. Noh spoke limited English, and almost all our discussions required a translator. It took weeks to set up a meeting with them. It was not until February 3, 1999—more than a month into our exclusivity period—that we were able to sit down for a substantive conversation. The meeting lasted from the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon, but we made no progress.

On February 11, in an attempt to get everyone better acquainted, I hosted a dinner, inviting BS Kang and two of his colleagues. Kang, the most senior of the three, arrived 45 minutes late and without much in the way of an apology. This was unheard of in Korea, where people bowed to each other when meeting on the streets and young people would hold the right elbow with the left hand when extending the right hand to shake hands with an older or more senior person. In my experience, Koreans were exceedingly courteous with outsiders and tended to be punctual, if not early. I could only interpret his behavior as a deliberate snub.

On Friday, February 12, David Bonderman arrived in Seoul with Dan Carroll. We met briefly that morning to discuss the situation and then met Chairman Lee for lunch.

Bonderman was not known for being subtle. As soon as lunch got under way, he turned to the FSC chairman and told him that our team did not think the negotiations were going well and that we felt the FSC team was not being cooperative. Chairman Lee, who was probably expecting a pleasant and courteous lunch, seemed taken aback. He turned around and spoke in Korean with his own team for a couple minutes. Turning back to us, he said he would look into it, assuring Bonderman that the deal was a high priority for the government.

Bonderman's complaint had an impact. After the lunch, the Newbridge and FSC teams sat down for another meeting. At the table on the FSC side were Director General Noh, Director Kang, and Myung-chun Lee, whom we called “Junior Lee” internally so as not to confuse him with the FSC chairman. The mood was tense. But I was relieved to see a familiar face: Dr. Kim, our former chief negotiator, was also in the room.

“Noh was mad as hell over the message you had delivered to Chairman Lee,” I wrote Bonderman in a subsequent memo. “I suppose he felt he had personally lost face.”

I told Noh that I was the one who had informed Bonderman of the current negotiation dynamics, and it was my view that we had reached a crisis point, which, without resolution, could derail the deal.

This caused a flurry of Korean on the other side of the table. Our advisor, Jihong Kim later explained that Junior Lee was getting scolded over his “attitude and personality” problems and was told to be more flexible. I then spent some time talking about the necessity of trust between the two sides and asked them to be honest with us if they felt we were not being fair on any issue. The FSC negotiators agreed, and said that they also appreciated the level of trust we had established before the MOU.

For the rest of the meeting, we discussed one specific deal-related issue: the assumed maturity we would use when marking to market KFB's rolled-over loans. When one-year loans were rolled over, their maturities were effectively extended, and therefore their interest rate should be changed to that for longer-term loans, we proposed.

“In the past two days of ‘working level’ discussion, Mr. Lee has become much more patient and engaging,” I told Bonderman in a memo. “He still does not agree with us on the maturity issue, but he is now willing to move on to other issues, leaving the difficult issues to a higher-level discussion. This has allowed us to make modest progress.”

The following week marked the Lunar New Year holiday, which was a big deal in Korea, as it is in China. While some Koreans worked on Christmas, as had Dr. Kim during our negotiations over the MOU, the Lunar New Year holiday was a time to be spent with family.

With little expected to happen on the deal for a full week and with schools in Hong Kong closed as well, Bin and I decided to take the family to Korea's Jeju Island, off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, for a holiday. I was studying Korean history and saw this as an opportunity to learn more about the country. I also wanted to be close to Seoul, where I would be headed immediately after the break.

On Jeju, we checked into a spacious and bright room at the Shilla Hotel, right by the ocean. The view of the endless blue sea was splendid. The weather in Seoul had been frigid when our flight left, but, just an hour south by plane, Jeju was mild, about 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). It was as if we had landed in another world. The island had been formed by volcanic eruptions, and evidence was apparent everywhere. Lava rocks covered much of the island. Over the centuries, locals have used chunks of them to build the dry-stone walls that snake across the windswept landscape. Where the lava flowed into the sea, it froze into strange and beautiful shapes. In the center of the island was Mt. Halla, a dormant volcano and Korea's tallest peak, which was lush with green vegetation.

Jeju was famous for its female divers. Even in wintertime, these intrepid women dove into the sea with no equipment but a wetsuit, a mask, and a heavy weight tied to a rope around their waists. There they would stay for several minutes, emerging from the depths with bushels of shellfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. It was hard work. They sold what they collected from the bottom of the sea to the passing tourists, who would sit on the rocks and eat it raw with some wasabi and soy sauce.

The divers were exclusively female, and I learned that they had taken up their trade out of necessity. In the old days fishermen often perished in storms, leaving their widows to make a living on their own. The women learned to dive to collect edible sea life from the ocean floor. All of the female divers I saw appeared quite old and I felt sure this tradition would soon die out, as I could not imagine younger women taking on such a hard and perilous job. But even if the widowed divers disappear into history, their spirit would live on. Watching them plunge into the cold surf, I felt they represented the audacity, resilience, and pride I had seen in the Korean people in the face of adversity and hardship. This is a nation that will emerge stronger from the economic crisis, I told myself. That was what we were betting on by acquiring Korea First Bank.

Every day on our vacation in Jeju, I worked the phones and joined conference calls with our teams to discuss the KFB deal. One day my daughter ran into the room. I put the phone on mute and called out to her, “LeeAnn, I love you!” All of a sudden the chattering on the conference call stopped. After a brief silence came the voice of Paul Chen: “Shan, we love you too!” Everyone on the call laughed. It turned out the mute function on the hotel phone did not work.

* * *

The month of February, interrupted by the long Lunar New Year holiday, came and went quickly, and there was no progress in our negotiations with the FSC. By the terms of the MOU, we had about two months left to reach a deal.

The mark-to-market pricing issue was a major sticking point, complicated by the fact that, in the middle of an economic crisis, there was hardly a market for these loans to be marked against. I spent the week negotiating with the FSC team, led by BS Kang, but we could not resolve how the mark should be determined. Under the current market conditions, if the bank sold a loan, even a performing one, it would have to sell it at a discount to book value. As for nonperforming loans, the situation was even worse; nobody wanted to buy them. Without a market, how were we to determine the market value of a loan?

Our advisors at E&Y proposed the parties use the current international standard, which employed a forward-looking methodology to classify loans. This meant that a loan would be classified according to how likely it was to be paid back to the bank. There were several major loan categories: normal, precautionary, substandard, doubtful, and loss. The last three classifications—substandard, doubtful, and loss—are generally considered to be nonperforming or bad loans and are often referred to as classified loans.

Under the forward-looking methodology, if a borrower's ability to repay seemed impaired, the bank would set aside provisions (reserves) to prepare for potential losses. For example, if the bank's credit officer determined that the bank could recover only 80 percent of the loan from a borrower, the bank would make a provision of 20 percent, marking down the value of the loan on its books to 80 percent of its original value.

At the time, Korean accounting practices were not forward looking. Rather, they focused on a borrower's record of meeting its interest-payment obligations. As long as borrowers were able to keep making interest payments on time, their loans would be classified as normal, and no provisions would be made for them. Continuing with this practice was, in our view, foolhardy. Thousands of Korean companies were struggling with massive debt loads, slashing staff and expenses to make their loan payments even as their cash flow dried up. But as far as their lenders were concerned, everything was just fine. The FSC still insisted on using this Korean standard, despite the number of failing borrowers that were crippling the banking industry.

Take, for example, Hanbo Steel, a former client of KFB's, whose collapse had helped precipitate Korea's financial crisis. To anyone aware of what was going on, it was clear that the company was overleveraged and that it would be only a matter of time before it collapsed under the weight of its debt. Still, Hanbo had made interest payments up to the moment it declared bankruptcy. A prudent bank would have classified its loans to Hanbo as either substandard or doubtful long before, and set aside reserves for it. The failure to do so by KFB and Hanbo's other creditor banks brought those banks down once Hanbo ran out of cash, because its loans had to be written off.

The Korean regulators were fully aware of the issues with the Korean standard of accounting. The Financial Supervisory Services, a sister organization of the FSC, was already planning to adopt a new, forward-looking methodology. Even so, the FSC was unwilling to implement this international standard in our contract for KFB. To us, this was like saying that an apple, rotten at the core but not yet on the surface, was still a good apple.

This was also a major deviation from the terms we'd agreed upon in the MOU, which called for both sides to use international standards to define good and bad loans. I soon discovered that this was not the only deviation.

During our previous negotiations, wanting to make absolutely sure of our right to put any bad loans to the government, I had secured a side letter from Dr. Kim, the chief negotiator, dated December 30, 1998, which read: “The Government allows the Investors to separate any loans to the bad bank whether they are normal, precautionary, or not before the transaction's close.”

Crucially, the FSC team would not acknowledge our right to choose the loans for the pre-close put, nor would they agree that Newbridge had an unlimited right to put a loan after the closing. Not only did this about-face ignore the terms in the MOU, but it also made the economics of the deal unworkable.

The FSC was working with its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, and accounting consultant Samil PriceWaterhouse (PwC). Both the Morgan Stanley and PwC teams told us privately that they were in basic agreement with us on our put right but they could not persuade their client to honor the MOU. Thinking that reason would prevail, I proposed that E&Y, representing Newbridge, and PwC, representing the FSC, work out the methodology between themselves without the interference of their respective clients. I hoped their professional standards would lead them to an agreement without Newbridge having to negotiate directly with the FSC team.

* * *

All of a sudden, we had even more reason to hurry. In late February, the FSC and HSBC made an announcement that they had agreed upon their own MOU for HSBC to acquire Seoul Bank. HSBC would pay the government $200 million up front and also put about $700 million in new capital into the bank.

HSBC had lost to Newbridge in the race to acquire KFB primarily because it limited the government's ownership stake to 20 percent. Now, in part because of our MOU to acquire KFB and the ensuing upgrade of Korea's sovereign debt, the government's bargaining position had improved significantly. The terms outlined in the announcement were much more favorable to the government, allowing it to retain 30 percent of the shares in Seoul Bank, with the right to buy another 19 percent, bringing its potential ownership to 49 percent. The announcement also said that HSBC would conduct a strict audit on Seoul Bank's assets and liabilities and would expect to close the transaction by late May.

It was clear that the government's deal with HSBC was more favorable for the government than our deal for KFB, especially given the up-front $200 million payment HSBC was to make.

With pride in his voice, Director General Noh told me that he had personally negotiated the HSBC deal. I felt that this only stiffened Noh’s resolve to get more concessions from Newbridge, regardless of what we'd agreed upon in the MOU. This also raised serious doubts about whether the government wanted our deal anymore.

My fears were not unfounded. A few days after the announcement of the HSBC deal, I met privately with Dr. Kim, the former FSC chief negotiator for the MOU. Though he was no longer part of the negotiation team, he had some insight into their thinking.

He told me that there was now strong opposition to our deal within the FSC. “You had better conclude the deal within the exclusivity period,” he told me, “or you might lose it altogether.”

It seemed, however, that the more urgently we needed to push forward, the slower negotiations became. We had a big team now. In addition to Dan Carroll, Paul Chen, Daniel Poon, the Lehman team, and me, we had added a few new faces. Jim Warner, an associate at Bonderman's firm, TPG, was seconded to the Newbridge team to help finalize the deal. Bob Barnum, the former president and chief operating officer of American Savings Bank, came over to advise on operational issues. Bob, a veteran bank executive with deep operating experience, recommended a few hires of his own, including SH Lee, a Korean American credit analyst who specialized in the local loan market and was familiar with the credit and financial capabilities of many Korean corporate borrowers.

The government's team was also growing. Whereas we had originally negotiated with the FSC alone, their side of the table now included representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation. This made meetings even more unwieldy. We often argued for hours without making progress on any of the major issues, especially on how to value the loans. Every term we had spent so much time on with the predecessor team now seemed to be viewed as subject to renegotiation, as if the MOU had not existed. And if we proposed any new terms or methodologies, the government rejected them without consideration or discussion.

* * *

March arrived. With two months left in the exclusivity period, we still had not established much trust with Noh’s team. It seemed the government team was afraid to accept any of our proposals, lest they should give away too much. Perhaps they considered us to be more financially sophisticated and were afraid we would take advantage of them.

Newbridge's financial model showed that the deal would be economically and financially untenable if we couldn't achieve the bare minimum of terms as agreed to under the MOU. This model was, essentially, our projection for how KFB would perform under our control. It was based on our team's accumulated knowledge and analysis of KFB, its business, and current market conditions. We applied this information and made various assumptions or projections about the bank's future performance, including assumed loan losses. It had been the basis for all of our negotiations so far. Meanwhile, the new FSC team seemed concerned that Newbridge would be making too much money out of the deal.

I realized that we needed to find a way to balance this information asymmetry if we were going to build trust. Before we adjourned our March 2 meeting, I proposed to share our financial model with the government side, so they could see how we looked at the economics of the whole deal and judge for themselves whether it was fair and reasonable. This would be a major reveal, and was almost unheard of in a negotiation of this nature. It was like revealing your battle plan to your opponent in the middle of a war. But I thought transparency would build trust. We needed them to understand that what we had proposed was fair and reasonable.

The FSC team was happy with our willingness to share our model. The next day, we spent the bulk of the day explaining it to them and walking them through the numbers. They listened attentively, without much comment, although the atmosphere became more relaxed. Nonetheless, we consistently received only one response to everything we had proposed: No.

Meanwhile, the question of how to mark to market KFB's loans was also stalled. My brilliant idea of punting the question to E&Y and PwC to sort out had failed. It turned out that the two accounting firms could not agree with each other on a methodology either. E&Y was focused on what our team needed, while PwC was worried about compromising the FSC's position. Although I was counting on their objectivity, each firm felt it was so important to prioritize the best interests of its clients that no agreement could be reached.

Recall from the terms of our MOU that this mark would be very important for both sides. The government would not only be responsible for filling the hole in the balance sheet created by the bad loans that KFB had made prior to Newbridge’s purchanse, it would also have to reimburse KFB for the mark on the loan book that we chose to retain. In other words, the government would have to pay KFB the difference between par and whatever we mutually agreed to mark our retained loan at.

Upon reflection, this disagreement on the mark-to-market methodology was probably inevitable. Even if we had come to an agreement regarding the methodology, we would have produced different results in our respective models. The Newbridge team would probably have considered it necessary to project more downside than upside for the immediate future of the Korean economy, which was still in the grip of a crisis. This would have resulted in a lower proposed mark on each individual loan, and thus a greater reimbursement from the government to bring each loan back to par. By contrast, the government's team would likely be more optimistic about the timing and the extent of an economic recovery. This would have led to a higher proposed mark on each loan, and hence less required reimbursement. Either side, I realized, could be right as nobody had a crystal ball to the future.

After some internal discussion with our advisors, Newbridge proposed an entirely new approach. Instead of pricing every single individual loan or asset to its fair market value, we would move to a portfolio approach. We would effectively buy a bundle of goods of mixed quality at a discount. We would take all the performing loans and negotiate an average value for the entire portfolio, using a top-down mark.

The markdown not only necessary for reimbursement, or hole filling, purposes, reflecting the fact that even some retained loans might be impaired. It was also important for the purpose of yield maintenance, meaning the principal of the loans had to be marked down so that the original contracted interest rates would provide a higher and sufficient yield, reflective of changed market conditions and the increased riskiness of some borrowers. The FSC agreed to consider this new approach, but the percentage of the markdown for the total portfolio was still subject to negotiation.

* * *

Two days later, my team and I met again with Director General Noh. I made two proposals. The first was to mark the loan portfolio KFB would retain 87.5 percent of book value, or a 12.5 percent discount. This took into consideration all the potential losses, as of closing, in KFB's retained loan book. Under the second proposal, we would mark the loan portfolio at 97.5 percent, but we would keep 50 percent of the reserves that KFB already had on its balance sheet. Reserves are taken by banks for potential loan losses and are normally paid for by existing shareholders. In the instance of KFB, a failed bank with negative shareholders’ equity, such reserves had effectively been funded by the Korean government. In both proposals we also would keep the right to transfer to the government, at original book value plus accrued interest, any existing loans that should go bad after closing, as described in the MOU. By our model and calculations, the two proposals were economically equivalent, so we would be indifferent between them.

I thought that the choice we now gave the government was reasonable and, in fact, generous. Under the MOU, we could have kept all the reserves that KFB had already taken and for the difference between par and our proposed 87.5 percent mark. Now we were giving them the choice between either 87.5 percent mark but no reserves or 97.5 percent mark with half of the reserves, which was a major concession on our part. Noh seemed to like the new approach and said he would come back to us after further study.

Anticipating that we would give up the mark-to-market approach on a loan-by-loan basis, I told our accounting advisors that we would not need as many of their staff as previously thought. As some of them cleared their desks, KFB management became somewhat alarmed. They thought the Newbridge team was preparing to move out. We didn't bother to correct them. It might help us to send a signal to the FSC that we were preparing for the worst. If negotiations continued to stall, we were ready to pull out.

We met with Noh and his team the next day. Our proposal was intended to be constructive and I hoped he would respond likewise, so I was dismayed to hear his response. Instead of taking one of my two proposals, he took the best part of each. His counterproposal was that the mark for the retained loan portfolio would be 97.5 percent of par and that KFB would turn over 100 percent of the reserves to the government. It was as if I had offered to buy a broken watch at a good discount or a new watch at the full price, but the shopkeeper would only agree to sell me the broken watch for the price of the new.

Our team was stupefied by Noh's audacity. His proposal was obviously unreasonable. He was violating the principles of good-faith negotiation, and, given the quality of the loans, his counterproposal was more than absurd. While we were making an effort to bridge the gap between us, he just refused to budge at all.

In my frustration, I suggested that we invite an international organization, such as the IMF or the World Bank, to adjudicate the value of the loan portfolio. Noh would have none of it, and the meeting was adjourned.

Afterwards, I called Dr. Kim to ask him what was going on within the FSC. He wouldn't tell me, but he admitted he was “not optimistic” about our deal. We seemed to have come to a dead end.

By now my team and I were camping out in Seoul all week and very often could not go home to Hong Kong even for the weekends.

On Saturday, March 6, we met with Director Kang and his team. I made a third proposal. We would accept pricing the loans at their original book value, but KFB would keep 100 percent of the loan loss reserves that KFB already taken.

This time Kang made a counterproposal: Put the mark at 97.5 percent of book value and let KFB keep 3.4 percent of its reserves. This essentially meant their proposed mark was 94.1 percent (97.5 minus 3.4), compared with our original proposal of 87.5 percent. The gap was still too wide, but it was at least some progress.

There were other signs that we were beginning to get through to the FSC team. That week's negotiations were the first time that Director General Noh became personally involved in the process, which we saw as an indication that the FSC team realized Newbridge was reaching a breaking point. We also learned that they worked until 1 am the night before to go through the analysis with their advisors.

As the talks went on, I began to understand that the FSC team would continue to test our limit because they did not know where it was. I requested a one-on-one meeting with Noh and told him in no uncertain terms that my last one was our final proposal and we would make no further concessions. I followed up by writing him a letter that reiterated that our position was in accordance with the MOU and suggested his side was abandoning the MOU for political reasons. He disagreed, calling my assessment of the situation an “inaccurate accusation.”

I reported all this in an internal memo to Blum and Bonderman. “Interestingly,” I wrote, “Noh is particularly sensitive to my suggestion of us jointly inviting an international agency, such as IMF/World Bank, to supervise the MOU execution process and indicates that he absolutely does not want that to happen.” Which was precisely why I suggested it.

On Monday, I received a fax response from Bonderman:

Shan, Thank you for the fax and the attached materials. I continue to believe that we have to hang very tough here and stick to the MOU. I also think that we have to tell the Koreans exactly what we are prepared to do and then behave in such a way. We also probably need to explain to them once again what it is that they are trying to do here—convince the rest of the world that they know how to run a banking system, and why this is the right method to prove that to everyone. If need be, Dick [Blum] or I can come back to Korea for a day to have a conversation with the Blue House and Chairman Lee.



Blum arrived in Seoul the next day. He went to meet with Chairman Lee. It was a friendly meeting. They both pledged to make an effort to get the deal done. Chairman Lee suggested that if we weren't close to a breakthrough by mid-April, two weeks before the expiration of exclusivity, the chairmen from both sides would meet again. Despite the understanding between the two chairmen, however, I detected no improvement in the way the FSC team conducted the negotiations on the ground.

Meanwhile, the representative of the World Bank in Seoul, Per Jedefors, reached out to us. He wanted to find out where the negotiations stood before the bank released the next tranche of its loan to South Korea. The World Bank and the IMF had a keen interest in our negotiations succeeding. One of the conditions of their $58 billion rescue package was that South Korea had to sell at least one of its two failed banks. We met so I could brief him on the status of the negotiations.

The World Bank knew the major terms of the MOU, and I explained our difficulty in finding common ground with the government. At the end of the meeting, he agreed we were following the MOU and had, in fact, made concessions in the government's favor. Jedefors said he would help push the deal process along in his conversations with the relevant Korean officials.

With six weeks until the end of the exclusivity period, I was following a grueling schedule. I would spend 10 to 12 hours a day negotiating with the FSC or working on the deal, then spend another several hours writing detailed memos to update my colleagues. On March 12 I circulated a memo to the Newbridge team to summarize the difficulty of our situation:

At the working level, we have made no meaningful progress since last Wednesday. There is some notable change in their attitude and tactics, however, after Dick's meeting with the chairman. Whereas in the past, they cited political reasons, the HSBC/Seoul Bank deal and public sentiment as their excuses to reject our proposals, now they describe our differences as a “genuine disagreement” on the interpretation of the MOU. In other words, they claim that they, too, are following the MOU and the difference is simply a matter of interpretation. They have used negative press to put pressure on us for weeks.



Bonderman, in typical fashion, responded via fax the same day: “I think we are being dunced around by people who have figured out that they cannot walk away from the MOU but who do not really want to proceed,” he wrote. “I think a very strong letter in which we make it clear that we understand what they are up to is in order more or less now.”

It was becoming apparent to me that our team in the United States was beginning to lose faith that the deal would ever get done. There was a lot of frustration all around. The following Monday, March 15, I spoke with our lawyer, Michael Ryan, who had worked with Bonderman on the ASB transaction, which we were using as a model for our KFB deal. He thought the deal was not going to happen, and he had shared his pessimism with Bonderman. We discussed possible ways of forcing the government's hand, including taking legal action.

“We have to force these guys to make a decision, one way or another, and sooner rather than later,” I wrote to him following our call. I suggested that our lawyers deliver an ultimatum to the FSC: Either accept Newbridge's minimum position, or we would hold the government in breach of the MOU and reserve the right to take legal action:

Of course, I defer to your professional judgment on whether or not we have a case against them either in the U.S. court or in Korea. I somehow feel that if the deal collapses, we have indeed relied on their promise to do a deal with us to our great detriment. The damages are real. At the end of the day, even if we do not win a lawsuit, the threat to sue may help focus the top leaders' attention.



My wording here was deliberate. I was referring to a legal concept in contract law in the United States, namely, detrimental reliance, which means that if one party has relied on a promise made by another party to do something and has, in doing so, incurred costs or detriments, the court may find the promising party obligated to make good on its promise, even though no formal contract exists between them.

My thinking was that, although our MOU was not legally binding, we might nonetheless have a case against the FSC because we had relied on the promises made in the MOU to incur considerable expenses. This reliance had undoubtedly been to our detriment, considering the legions of lawyers, analysts, and accountants already working on this deal, in addition to our own time and effort. Newbridge had already spent millions of dollars pursuing KFB, and the meter was still running. A legal challenge could help prove to the government how serious we were. And if worst came to worst, we had to protect our interests.
