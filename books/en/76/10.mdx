title: 10 Black Rain
---






Hong Kong Island is situated in a well-worn typhoon path on the southern tip of China's eastern coast. The period between July and September is the peak season for these massive storms, which draw energy from the warm Pacific Ocean and move northwest toward the Asian landmass. The city has grown accustomed to these typhoons, though, and literally pulls down its shutters and battens the doors when one approaches.

As luck would have it, a typhoon was bearing down on Hong Kong on Sunday, August 22, the day before Ambassador Hyun's scheduled visit. The Hong Kong Observatory, the official government weather service, measures typhoons on a scale of intensity: 1, 3, 8, 9, and 10, with 10 being the strongest. The number 3 signal was hoisted that morning. Dark clouds were gathering, and the wind was strong. I hurried to go out on my daily 10-kilometer run before it was too late. A major storm hit almost as soon as I got back home. By then, the number 8 typhoon signal had been raised. I felt lucky to have missed the worst of the storm, but I was worried that if the weather did not let up soon, Ambassador Hyun might not make it to Hong Kong the next day.

The weather wreaked worse havoc than I imagined. Typhoon Sam, as it was called, brought torrents of rain bucketing down on the city along with high winds that ripped branches from trees. At Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok airport, a China Airlines (Taiwan's flagship airline) jet flipped over while attempting to land during the storm, skidding across the runway median and catching fire. Three passengers were killed in the crash. The next morning, the storm had abated somewhat but the observatory maintained its black rain warning, and most offices were closed. To say the very least, I expected Ambassador Hyun's arrival to be delayed.

This was frustrating, as our various conversations over the preceding days had been interesting, if not entirely productive. Chairman Lee was now “serious” about doing a deal before the end of the month, Hyun told me, although candidly, I didn't think any of us took his seriousness seriously anymore. However, he felt the recent uptick in the Korean economy had strengthened his bargaining position, and he was still insisting that we resolve the five issues he had raised on August 2.

In a strategy memo to Blum and Bonderman, I outlined my plan for discussions with the ambassador. As far as the economic situation was concerned, I was in agreement with Chairman Lee: Things had changed. But not for the better, given what was going on with Daewoo. And while Newbridge was honorable enough to be willing to keep our part of the bargain, the patience of our chairmen was wearing thin. We needed to bring this transaction to a close by Labor Day in the United States—or else. I intended to leave our actions to Chairman Lee's imagination if the deadline wasn't met. The more we left things ambiguous, I reasoned, the more threatened our counterparty was likely to feel. Regardless, the message was the same: Storm clouds were gathering.

Ambassador Hyun did make the trip to Hong Kong, but his flight was delayed by several hours and he did not arrive until very late. We agreed to meet the next morning in his hotel.

The next day, August 24, the black rain continued. The clouds were so dark and the rain was so heavy that day looked like night. The traffic was snarled by the flooding and felled trees. It took me three times longer than usual to drive from my home in the Mid-Levels to the Shangri-La Hotel, where the ambassador was staying. I met with him at about 9:30 am.

After the drama of his arrival and my anticipation of a new message, I felt quite let down when, in our meeting, Hyun simply urged us to seriously consider Chairman Lee's five points and revealed nothing new. Hyun explained that Lee was sticking to his position on the points because economic conditions had changed so deal conditions needed to change.

After hearing this, I wondered why the ambassador thought it was necessary to make a special trip at all. After thanking him for taking the trouble to come all the way from Seoul in such dreadful weather, I said, “Ambassador Hyun, candidly, I have written this project off. In our view, the economic situation is not getting better, it has worsened, but we have kept our word. I regret that Chairman Lee did not keep his. At this stage, I think there is nothing further to discuss with him.”

At about 11:30 am, Hyun and I called Blum and Bonderman. Without having consulted with me, their response echoed mine. Bonderman bluntly said Chairman Lee had been less than straight with us. After some discussion, Hyun agreed that we should send Lee a final position paper and term sheet. If Lee agreed to use it as a basis for further negotiation, I would go to Seoul for a final round of talks. If Lee did not agree, we would terminate the negotiation.

Hyun left that afternoon for Seoul. I felt so sorry for him having traveled all that way in the middle of a major typhoon without being able to achieve the intended results.

I went home to draft our position paper. My children were there, happy because schools were closed for the third straight day due to the weather. The next morning, I got up at 5 to begin revising our term sheet. By noon, I had it ready to fax to Hyun, who was back in Seoul.

Our position paper was three pages long and accompanied our revised Terms of Investment document, which now ran to 25 pages. The paper reviewed our stance on all the major issues raised by the government and indicated where we could accommodate the government and where we could not. We also addressed Chairman Lee's points to the extent we felt was necessary to communicate that we were serious. We didn't respond directly to Lee's request for upside participation for the government, but we noted that the MOU and subsequent agreement already included a 5 percent warrant. Therefore, the government would have more upside than its pro rata share of ownership.

Regarding the call option for the impaired loans if the government disputed the provisioning amount, I had earlier agreed with Chairman Lee that if the government did not wish to pay for the impairment determined by KFB's management, it had the right to submit such disagreement to an adjudication process. I pointed out that it would be unfair to give the government a call option after it lost in the adjudication process whereas we had to accept the ruling one way or another. I suggested we could accept either adjudication or a call option by the government but not both.

We stuck to our guns on the issue of capital ratio and risk weight. Loans needed to be assigned risk weights commensurate with their risks in accordance with internationally accepted banking regulations. As for the capital ratio, the FSC wanted KFB to maintain a capital ratio of no less than 10 percent, as opposed to the regulatory requirement of 8 percent. We thought KFB's BIS ratio would be above 10 percent anyway, but we could not accept a capital ratio requirement that was different from that of other banks.

Addressing Lee's concern over asset selection. We repeated, again, that we would provide a list of the assets we would not want to keep a month after the term sheets were signed, and any disagreement as to initial asset selection would be liquidated as agreed upon in the MOU.

Finally, we addressed the topic of staff reduction and the associated indemnification. We were willing to concede to the government's request to notify it with a list of employees subject to reduction before closing.

These were the main points at issue, but there were several others, including a few of our own that we wanted to make sure everyone was clear on before proceeding.

The first pertained to the drag-along right. This referred to Newbridge's right to sell the shares owned by the government when we sold our own shares, and it was critical if we were ever going to exit this investment. No matter how good a job we did turning around the bank, nobody was going to want to buy it if they had to negotiate separately for both halves. The drag-along language had been agreed to in the MOU, and we weren't going to revisit it.

Our lawyers were also unequivocal on not including the phrase “due care” in the contract, as requested by the FSC. Newbridge was willing to address the issue with a side letter, per our earlier agreement, but we could not make any further commitment above and beyond what was required by law.

Finally, we explained why we would require that all payments made to KFB by the government in exchange for carved-out bad assets be in the form of interest-bearing government bonds. This was consistent with the MOU, and our rationale was the same as it had been throughout negotiations. It would be too costly for the bank to hold a large amount of cash that would not earn any yield and that, under current market conditions, would take time to turn into loans and other interest-earning assets.

Before passing the terms and position paper along to Ambassador Hyun, I faxed them to Blum and Bonderman for their review, along with a cover memo in which I also shared a few other pieces of news. It seemed that Chairman Lee was being sued, along with the FSC, by a U.S. firm called Panacom, which had tried to bid for Korea Life Insurance but had been eliminated from the process—unfairly and illegally, Panacom claimed.

Separately, I'd heard from a friend about a similar suit. Leslie Koo, a Taiwanese businessman, told me that his company, Taiwan Cement, had served notice of potential litigation on a Korean firm for breaching an MOU for the acquisition of a black carbon business. He said that the Koreans had stopped talking with him prior to the notice. Afterward, he said, they became anxious to strike a deal with him.

“I think that we should similarly consider threatening to sue the FSC for our losses and expenses in the event Lee refuses to do the deal based on the term sheet we will send him,” I wrote.

“I can see no reason why we, too, should not sue the FSC if the deal falls apart here,” Bonderman faxed back. Blum agreed.

We sent both the position paper and the revised Terms of Investment document, which both parties would refer to as the TOI, to Ambassador Hyun to discuss with Chairman Lee on our behalf on August 25.

Hyun met with Lee the following morning and called me at 10:30 am to give me an update. The meeting had lasted for more than an hour, with Hyun going through the position paper point by point. Lee reacted rather strongly to the idea that the government would be dragged along into whatever sale Newbridge decided to make, Hyun told me, although the ambassador took pains to explain to Chairman Lee that Newbridge was a reputable long-term investor and there was no reason to assume it would do anything other than what was in the best interest of all shareholders. When they were discussing the upside participation issue, Lee asked again if Newbridge was committed to investing 500 billion won initially and another 100 billion won a year for the next two years. Hyun replied yes, if all other conditions were met, which wasn't entirely correct. I had to remind the ambassador that when we agreed to the 500 billion won number, Lee had already dropped any request for subsequent investments of dividends. Hyun agreed to remind Lee and clarify this point with him again.

Chairman Lee had either explicitly or implicitly accepted a number of Newbridge's requests. For example, he thought our position of “either call option or adjudication” for impaired loans seemed to be fair. He agreed to our right to select assets before close and asked only that we provide the list of what we would not take one month before close. He thought that Newbridge had a good argument that KFB should not follow a different standard for capital ratio. And he did not argue against our position on indemnification for employee reduction.

Aside from those issues, Chairman Lee did not have much of a reaction one way or another to the points raised in our position paper. After going through it item by item, Hyun moved on to the message I had given him in Hong Kong. Support for this deal within Newbridge was wearing thin, he said. Newbridge was losing confidence and trust in Chairman Lee, and his own reputation was at stake.

On the bright side, Hyun continued, “If you do this deal, Newbridge will bring in world-class management. They are good corporate citizens with a reputation to protect.” The international response, he reminded Chairman Lee, was going to be positive. Whatever domestic political problems might arise could be handled.

Chairman Lee listened attentively. At the end of the meeting, he said that he would need some time to think about it and get back to us.

The next day, however, we were surprised by a Bloomberg report with the headline “Korea First Bank Sale Will Take Several Months, FSC says.” It quoted Chairman Lee as saying “The talks are only at the stage of drawing up terms of investment, and it will take several more months to complete.”

I was quite disturbed by these remarks. What did Lee mean, the KFB deal would take several more months to complete? Was he stalling for time? Why did he indicate a willingness to reengage with us and then turn around and give this statement to the media?

The press was eager to hear our side. I spoke with both Bloomberg and Bridge News expressing our displeasure, but I asked them to hold off printing my comments, because I wanted to hear first what Lee's real intent was. I called Ambassador Hyun to say that in view of the fact that the FSC was clearly walking away from the deal, we needed to demand compensation for our costs and damages.

Hyun had not yet seen the Bloomberg article and was quite alarmed by it. He called Lee right away. The chairman claimed to have been quoted out of context. The reporter had asked if the troubles at Daewoo would affect the KFB transaction with Newbridge, Lee explained. His answer was that by the time definitive documents were signed, the Daewoo situation would have become clear and therefore there would be no effect. He insisted he was referring to the time it would take to sign the definitive documents concluding the sale, not the signing of the terms of investment. He said he understood fully the negative impact on the financial community if the deal collapsed.

It being a Friday, Lee promised Ambassador Hyun he would have a definitive answer on our term sheet by Monday. Over the weekend, he would formally discuss the deal with both the finance minister and the Chief Secretary for Economic Affairs of the Blue House. He might have to obtain the approval from the president as well.

“Do you think Lee is serious?” I asked Hyun. I had to report back to both Blum and Bonderman, and the ambassador's thoughts would influence our internal decision making. I also repeated that we had to draw this process to a conclusion, one way or the other, by Labor Day, September 6.

The ambassador replied that, in his view, Lee was serious but he wanted to do the deal with a minimum amount of criticism. The upcoming meetings with the finance minister and the chief secretary were crucial.

* * *

In spite of Chairman Lee's promises that he would get back to us after his weekend meetings, we heard nothing from him for days. We could only guess why there was no response. He had plenty to say to reporters, though. On Monday, Bloomberg ran an article reporting that the HSBC/Seoul Bank deal was on the rocks. The headline read “HSBC, Korea Reach Impasse on Seoul Bank Sale, Regulator Says.” The article opened with a quote from Chairman Lee that the government was “no longer talking” to HSBC about the Seoul Bank sale after HSBC and the FSC couldn't agree on how to define bad loans. “It is very difficult to reduce the gap,” Lee told reporters.

The article mentioned that the FSC was still in talks with Newbridge over the sale of Korea First Bank and quoted Lee as saying that the government was “still working very hard to narrow the differences with Newbridge.” However, he went on to say that even if the terms of sale were agreed upon soon, completion of the transaction would take two to three months.

Often, it was hard to tell what spin Chairman Lee was putting on the stories he fed the press. It would be quite significant for us if the FSC was really having trouble reaching an agreement with HSBC. I knew Lee would not have publicly broadcast this if the terms and conditions HSBC was offering were more favorable than ours were. What I was not sure of, however, was if this was actually the situation between the two parties or just more posturing. I did not know if Lee was using the press to put pressure on HSBC to sweeten its terms, or if their deal was really dead.

Jihong Kim wrote me a memo the next day, saying that Korean newspapers were running similar stories, describing the negotiations with Newbridge as on track while saying the HSBC deal for Seoul Bank was likely to fail. Lee again went on the record, blaming the impasse on HSBC's insistence on using forward-looking international criteria for evaluating loans, despite its earlier agreement to use the Korean standard. By the end of the day, the FSC and HSBC made an announcement that they had mutually agreed to terminate negotiations for Seoul Bank. The breakup was now official. At this point, I could not tell if it was good or bad for us. If the government felt it had to do one of the two bank deals, then it was good news. If the termination reflected a stiffened stance adopted by the government or its unwillingness to sell either of the banks, then it was bad news. In any case, there was no word from Lee.

* * *

Given the lack of communication from the other side, I made plans to return to Hong Kong because there was nothing for me to do in Seoul. But on September 1, the day before I was scheduled to fly out, Hyun called to say that Lee had contacted him. Lee wanted me to meet with him the following afternoon, so we made plans to meet at 3 pm.

In the meantime, we received a position paper from the FSC. I didn't know whether this was a result of my letter, but it was a start, at least. On reviewing the paper, however, I realized we were still far apart on a number of issues. Lee still felt strongly about the drag-along clause, despite the fact that we had already addressed and dismissed the concerns of the FSC during previous rounds of debate. In addition, we were still no closer to an agreement on risk weighting, compliance, the form of government payment, and a host of other issues.

Even though there appeared to be some movement on the FSC's part, we felt that this might be yet another false start. We were still looking into the possibility of filing a lawsuit against the FSC in the event that it decided to walk away from the deal. Panacom, the U.S. company, had recently won a critical court victory in its battle to take control of Korea Life. The success of this court challenge against the FSC was an encouraging sign that the Korean judicial system could be counted on to be impartial, even in lawsuits against the government. Bonderman was looking into who was representing Panacom to get a sense of how strong Newbridge's case could be, should we need to walk away.

Hyun and I went to meet with Chairman Lee on September 2 in the same Korea Federation of Banks Building in Myeong-dong. Obviously, Lee preferred to meet there rather than in his own FSC office building. I assumed there were two reasons for his choice of the meeting place. One was to avoid the reporters camped out at the FSC. The other was that he did not want to invite Director General Noh and his team but wanted to avoid the overt snub of excluding them from a meeting in their own building. I thought it was a good sign that Noh was not invited.

We walked into the meeting room to see Lee seated in his usual seat. He did not look good, and seemed to have a bad cold.

The meeting turned out to be both encouraging and frustrating. All the issues that I had expected to be sticky ones turned out not to be very difficult. Some issues that I had thought would be easy ones turned out to be very difficult indeed.

We made considerable progress around the size of the investment, the way we would handle impaired loans, indemnification, and initial asset selection.

As far as the size of Newbridge's investment, Lee wanted to have a larger number for public relations purposes. I showed him a copy of a side letter that we had sent to the FSC on July 11, which made clear that Newbridge would consider making an additional investment of 100 billion won in each of the next two years but would be under no obligation to do so. If we did invest more, our share of equity would increase accordingly. He had no problem with such a formulation.

On impaired loans, Lee agreed to treat all loans the same way: KFB would determine the necessary provision (impairment amount); the government had the option to fund it, call the loan (buy it at book value), or go for adjudication. If it chose adjudication, the result would be binding on both parties, and the government would have no more call right.

Regarding our initial selection of assets and liabilities, we agreed to provide a list of those assets that we would not keep within a month after signing of the new terms of investment. I confirmed that we would keep the head office building at its book value.

We even managed to reach an agreement on the drag-along right. After we'd spent a considerable amount of time on the issue, the ambassador suggested that we put in language to say that the purpose of the drag-along right was to maximize shareholder value, which was the argument I had been making all along. Surprisingly, that was okay with Lee, as he thought that would satisfy any possible public inquiry. He only asked that we share information with the government, on a confidential basis, when we were negotiating to sell our and the government's shares.

Employee reductions, however, proved to be an area where we could not reach an agreement. Lee agreed to a reduction of “senior management employees” and to indemnify the new KFB for such reductions, but he insisted that the government would have nothing to do with any reductions among KFB's unionized workers. It was a political issue more than an economic one; the government did not want to be perceived as being involved in those types of layoffs at all.

We also got stuck on the question of risk weight. This was a regulatory concern, Lee said. He noted that other government-owned banks had similar protections but received full risk weight. I argued that injection of capital by the government, as happened with other banks, was not the same as protecting the capital base from loan losses, which was what we would be facing at KFB. In this case, government protection of a loan reduced its risk practically to zero, but my reasoning was to no avail. I got the feeling that Lee was going to continue to be stubborn on the issue.

Fiscal year was another surprising sticking point. We wanted to move the start of KFB's fiscal year from calendar year to the month immediately following the completion of our acquisition of KFB, so there would be a clear break point marked by the change of control. Again, Lee considered it a regulatory issue he absolutely could not give ground on. All banks must use the calendar year as the fiscal year, he said.

A final, confounding issue was the binding nature of the Terms of Investment document that we were negotiating. I had not expected it to be a stumbling block. We spent over an hour discussing it, but Lee would not agree to use the term “binding.” Lee's own team had advised that Eric Yoon, their White & Case counsel, told them that a binding TOI was unusual in international contract law and that to include the term would open them up to potential damages greater than a breakup fee.

Although the latter might be true, I responded, it would go both ways. Newbridge would be exposed to the same risk as the government. Furthermore, I said, it would be meaningless to sign a nonbinding TOI document. We adjourned without an agreement on the issue.

Lee had to leave, but he reiterated that half of the government payment to KFB (to fill the hole left after the bad loans were carved out) be in cash and half in the government note. He suggested that we meet again the next afternoon to resume negotiations.

Overall, while I was reasonably pleased that we had managed to make headway on some difficult issues, I was concerned that this too might prove fleeting. We had been here before, having reached an agreement only to see the FSC change its mind again.

For example, we had agreed on the binding nature of the terms of investment before, but now Lee was being advised by his lawyer not to accept this. From our point of view, another MOU-type term sheet without any binding effect would be meaningless. If the MOU could be ignored, there was no reason another piece of paper could not be treated the same way. Lee was asking us to trust that the government would abide by the term sheet, even if it was nonbinding. In view of our experiences so far, all of us on the Newbridge side were adamant that if we signed anything at all, it had to be binding on both parties.

I had dinner that evening with Ambassador Hyun at the Japanese restaurant in the Chosun Hotel. Although he was always careful with what he had to say, Hyun seemed pleased with the outcome of the day's meeting. He was cautiously optimistic.

So was Bonderman. “It looks like there is actually some progress being made,” he noted wryly in response to my memo updating him on the latest developments. He thought we might be able to agree to the government's position on unionized employees, as long as there wouldn't be many terminations at that staff level. As to the risk weighting, Bonderman suggested that we recalibrate our model to see how much the change would affect the results. His response to the binding nature of the terms surprised me a little. Bonderman was willing to consider a nonbinding term sheet as long as there was a breakup fee and that all of our team's expenses would be paid by the government if it did not proceed. He thought a breakup fee would at least improve our position over where we had been, which was that we might end up with neither a deal nor any compensation for our expenses.

I didn't think I could accept a breakup fee or anything short of a legally binding obligation on both parties. At that point, my biggest regret was having agreed to an MOU without any legally binding effect. That was what had put us in such a difficult position. We could still end up with no deal, even having spent so much time, effort, and resources on it. I was determined not to repeat the mistake. Bonderman was right that the breakup fee would be better than nothing, because we had no intention of walking away. I felt such a fee would both deter the government from walking and compensate us for our considerable efforts and expense. Even so, it was a suboptimal solution. I was especially mindful of the fact that politicians tended to change their minds when political winds shift, and I did not want to give them an easy way out after all this work.

I met with Chairman Lee again on the afternoon of September 3 at the same Federation of Banks Building. I could tell immediately that he was in a foul mood. He began to complain as soon as we sat down. “You claim to have a world-class management,” he said. “Why can't you take half cash and half government note?” What he meant was that with a world-class management, we ought to be able to turn cash into loans or earning assets quickly, so he didn't see why we were resisting accepting cash which the government would pay KFB for the carved-out bad loans before closing. He said the FSC could opt to pay cash, in lieu of the government note.

On the government note, he took issue with how we would calculate the basis to set the interest rate. We had planned to use the average funding cost, or the average cost of liabilities, of the bank. He pointed to our position paper and said that the government had never agreed to “this condition,” meaning the basis of calculating funding costs to exclude non-interest-bearing liabilities. I disagreed and pointed out that we actually took the exact language of the FSC's own term sheet of July 2 on the government note. After much discussion in English and Korean, Lee looked confused and told me several times that was not how his people had reported the situation to him.

“Mr. Noh must have hidden the truth from you,” I said, half joking. I recommended he call BS Kang. He did and confirmed that his team did agree.

Nonetheless, he offered me two alternatives: (a) a 100 percent government note from the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, but the cost basis had to include non-interest-bearing liabilities; or (b) 50 percent notes and 50 percent cash if the cost basis excludes non-interest-bearing liabilities.

The interest rate on the government note was to be set at a spread over the average funding cost of the bank. If non-interest-bearing liabilities, which were part of the bank's funding sources, were included, the average funding cost would be lower; therefore, the interest rate on the government note would also be lower. We could not agree with each other but simply noted our differences.

The rest of the conversation was similarly frustrating. It turned out that the Newbridge side had erred, based on the analysis by our consultants, Bain & Company, in asserting that the reductions would concentrate more on nonunion labor; the opposite was true. “We goofed on this subject,” I admitted to Blum and Bonderman in a memo. We'd have to go back to Bain to do further analysis to see what our alternatives were.

Just as the meeting was getting ready to wind up, however, we had what seemed to be a breakthrough on the binding nature of the terms of investment. Lee said that while he could accept the document as binding, he objected to the word “binding,” which was potentially offensive in Korean.

After consulting with out lawyer, Rich Lincer of Cleary, we came up with some new language, which read, in part, “the parties hereby agree to abide by these terms of investment as the basis for definitive agreement.” Lee seemed satisfied with the new language but said he would need to reconfirm. It seemed clear that the form was more important than the substance in this case. On other issues, though, we remained far apart. One new concern was how KFB and the government would handle yield maintenance for work-out loans, such as the massive new work-outs the bank was dealing with from Daewoo. If a bad loan was restructured into a work-out loan, usually the loan maturity would be much extended and interest payments would be either frozen or forgiven to give the borrower time to work out its problems and to get back on its financial feet. The government was fine with paying for provisions for the loans but considered yield maintenance—essentially, guaranteeing the expected interest payments on the loan—off the table.

Because loan and interest payments froze during work-outs, this put us in a bad position. In the case of a default or bankruptcy, the bank could always put the loan back to the government. But a long-term work-out would deprive KFB of sorely needed interest income without the government's yield maintenance. As we could not agree with each other, for now, I noted my strong objection to Lee's position on the issue.

Lee proposed to meet again on Sunday at 5 pm at the Shilla Hotel.

I didn't know what to make of Chairman Lee's transformation between one meeting and the next. On one hand, just by devoting so much time to it, it seemed that he wanted a deal, and our progress in the first meeting was promising. On the other, the second meeting brought new issues on which the chairman refused to budge. I hoped that a third meeting would lead things to finally break in our favor.
