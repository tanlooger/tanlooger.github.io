PRAISE FOR THE DUNE CHRONICLES

DUNE

“An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.”

—The Washington Post

“Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.”

—Robert A. Heinlein

“Herbert’s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.”

—The Louisville Times

“One of the landmarks of modern science fiction…an amazing feat of creation.”

—P. Schuyler Miller

DUNE MESSIAH

“Brilliant…It is all that Dune was, and maybe a little more.”

—Galaxy Magazine

“The perfect companion piece to Dune…fascinating.”

—Challenging Destiny

CHILDREN OF DUNE

“A major event.”

—Los Angeles Times

“Ranging from palace intrigue and desert chases to religious speculation and confrontations with the supreme intelligence of the universe, there is something here for all science fiction fans.”

—Publishers Weekly

“Herbert adds enough new twists and turns to the ongoing saga that familiarity with the recurring elements brings pleasure.”

—Challenging Destiny

GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE

“Rich fare…heady stuff.”

—Los Angeles Times

“A fourth visit to distant Arrakis that is every bit as fascinating as the other three—every bit as timely.”

—Time

“Book four of the Dune series has many of the same strengths as the previous three, and I was indeed kept up late at night.”

—Challenging Destiny

HERETICS OF DUNE

“A monumental piece of imaginative architecture…indisputably magical.”

—Los Angeles Herald Examiner

“Appealing and gripping…fascinating detail, yet cloaked in mystery and mysticism.”

—The Milwaukee Journal

“Herbert works wonders with some new speculation and an entirely new batch of characters. He weaves together several fascinating story lines with almost the same mastery as informed Dune, and keeps the reader intent on the next revelation or twist.”

—Challenging Destiny

CHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE

“Compelling…a worthy addition to this durable and deservedly popular series.”

—The New York Times

“The vast and fascinating Dune saga sweeps on—as exciting and gripping as ever.”

—Kirkus Reviews
