Introduction


I’m trying to get the birds to sing. If I can calm my mind just enough, they will sing.

Though I’ve tried to convince my children otherwise, I don’t have magical powers. I’m wearing a simple headband embedded with electrodes that detect my brain wave activity and send it via Bluetooth to an application on my iPhone. Brain waves—the oscillating electrical voltages in your brain—are small in size (just a few millionths of a volt), but they reveal a lot about the inner workings of your mind. When I relax into a meditative state, my alpha brain wave activity rises, and the app rewards me with the sound of singing birds. This neurofeedback technique has proven powerful in preventing the migraine attacks that have dogged me since childhood.

Having used the device a number of times, I know how to increase my alpha waves—the pattern of electrical activity produced by the brain when you’re feeling calm and peaceful—and reduce my beta wave activity—the higher-speed brain waves that occur when you’re wide awake and thinking. I focus on a happy memory:

My eldest daughter, Aristella, is just three years old, and we are hiking as a family to a waterfall in the mountains of North Carolina. The season is late fall; afternoon sun glistens through trees still dotted with red and orange as we crunch through the fallen leaves beneath our feet. I can almost feel the sun on my face and hear the water gurgling over waterworn rocks. In my mind, I hear Aristella’s peals of laughter as she races a leaf downstream against one tossed in by my husband, Thede.

Chirp, chirp! The app confirms that my brain is responding.

Whether we are meditating, doing a math calculation, recalling a phone number, or browsing through our mental thesaurus for just the right word, neurons are firing in our brains, creating minuscule electrical discharges. When a mental state like relaxation or stress is dominant, hundreds and thousands of neurons are firing in characteristic patterns that can be measured with an electroencephalogram, or EEG.

Scientists used to have to place electrodes directly on the periosteum—the inner layer of the scalp—to pick up brain waves. The procedure required surgery under anesthesia and carried risks, including fever, infection, and leaking brain fluid. Today, the electrodes can be placed externally, on the forehead or the surface of the scalp. EEG devices detect and record brain waves in terms of cycles per second, known as hertz (Hz).1 Alpha waves, for example, clock in at the 8–13 Hz range.

Had I wanted to, I also could have placed electrodes over the muscles on my body, to measure the signals sent to them while I was meditating. Our brains are constantly transmitting signals to our peripheral nervous system—the parts of the nervous system beyond the brain and the spinal cord. Electromyography (EMG) can be used to detect the electrical activity in response to a nerve’s stimulation of the muscle in millivolts, ranging from 0 to 10 mV (+5 to −5).2 Together, EEG and EMG give us a window on what our brain is up to at any given moment, including the instructions it is sending to the rest of the body.

Our use of EEG and EMG draws on discoveries made by two Italian scientists in the late 1700s regarding the electric battery and bioelectrical activity in the body. More recent technological leaps in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have converged to give us consumer neurotech devices—a catchall term for gadgets that connect human brains to computers, and the ever more sophisticated algorithms that allow those computers to analyze the data they receive. At first, neuroscientists rightly dismissed all these consumer devices as inaccurate and unvalidated, little better than toys. But as both the hardware and software improved, consumer neurotech became more accurate and harder to dismiss. The average tech-savvy person can now “see” their emotions,3 arousal, and alertness,4 and track how effectively they are meditating.5

Personal neurotech devices are just one part of the growing category of wearable tech, which allows the average technophile to quantify their bodily functions. The category is so popular that as of 2020, nearly one out of every five Americans was using one.6 There are more than three hundred thousand different mobile health apps available worldwide (a number that has doubled in just five years), with an estimated market value surpassing $100 billion.7

Globally, the market for neurotechnology is growing at a compounded annual rate of 12 percent and is expected to reach $21 billion by 2026.8 Consumers can see graphic displays of their brain wave activity in real time—delta (dreamless sleep), theta (deep relaxation, daydreaming, inwardly focused), alpha (very relaxed, taking a break, meditating), beta (aroused, engaged, stressed), and gamma (concentrating) waves—as well as patterns of blood flow in their brains and even the bioelectric changes in their muscles.9

Self-tracking is far more than a fad. It’s a new way of living and thinking about ourselves.

Neurotechnology can tell us if we’re wired to be conservative or liberal,10 whether our insomnia is as bad as we think,11 and if we’re in love with someone or just “in lust.”12 We can learn how we process risks and rewards and whether we’re congenitally disposed to be spendthrifts or tightwads.13 Soon, smart football helmets will be able to diagnose concussions immediately after they occur. Neurotech devices can also track changes in our brains over time, such as the slowing down of activities in certain brain regions associated with the onset of conditions like Alzheimer’s disease,14 schizophrenia,15 and dementia.16 Not everyone wants to know if one of those conditions is in the cards for them, but those who do may benefit from having time to prepare.

Neurotech companies are already marketing technology to detect drivers who may be drowsy and prevent them from falling asleep at the wheel. A simple, wearable device that measures EEG can alert individuals who have epilepsy to oncoming seizures, while those with quadriplegia can type on computers using just their thoughts. I am excited by the promise of this technology to help people lead better lives, and a huge proponent of empowering people to take charge of their own health and well-being by giving them access to information about themselves. But there is another side to this technology, a Pandora’s box that keeps me up at night.

The same neuroscience that gives us intimate access to ourselves can allow companies, governments, and all kinds of actors who don’t necessarily have our best interests in mind access too. I find this terrifying as an Iranian American because nothing in the US Constitution, state and federal laws, or international treaties gives individuals even rudimentary sovereignty over their own brains. It’s not going to happen tomorrow, but we are rapidly heading toward a world of brain transparency, in which scientists, doctors, governments, and companies may peer into our brains and minds at will. And I worry that in this rapidly approaching future, we will voluntarily or involuntarily surrender our last bastion of freedom: our mental privacy. That we will trade access to our brain activity to commercial entities for rebates, discounts on insurance, free access to social media accounts … or even as a condition for keeping our jobs.

It’s already begun. In China, train drivers on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed rail line, the busiest in the world, must wear EEG devices while they are behind the controls, to ensure that they are focused and alert. According to some news sources, workers in government-controlled factories are required to wear EEG sensors to monitor their productivity and their emotional states, and they can be sent home based on what their brains reveal.

Here in the United States, we are into the second decade of a large-scale, federally funded project called Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) “aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain.”17 In 2001, DARPA (the US Defense Department’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) launched its hotly contested Augmented Cognition program, which develops “technologies to augment warfighters’ cognitive capacity and capabilities”; its Human Assisted Neural Devices program aims to decode the human brain to better characterize and mitigate threats to it; and Active Authentication hopes to find each person’s unique “cognitive fingerprint” so they can be biometrically identified. And militaries across the world are developing weapons to precisely attack our brains, “for determining victory or defeat in the battlefield.”18

Corporations are getting in on the act too. Before long, computers will interface with our brains directly, allowing companies to know what products we want before we do—and which pitches we are the most primed to love. L’Oréal, the beauty and fragrance world leader, has even launched a strategic partnership with Emotiv, a large neurotech company, to target fragrance selection to individual brains. It now offers in-store consultations to help consumers find the “perfect scent suited to their emotions” by asking the customer to wear a multi-sensor EEG-based headset to detect and decode their brain activity through powerful machine learning algorithms.19 Will people willingly trade their brain data for customized perfume? Will those of us who refuse the technology have advertisements targeted to our brains based on the data amassed from other people? And is this just the tip of the iceberg of corporate collection and commodification of our brains?

As an ethicist, lawyer, and philosopher, I believe that we can and should embrace emerging neurotechnology, but only if we first update our concept of liberty to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of doing so.

Modern liberalism is undergirded by the concept of liberty given to us by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill in his 1859 classic, On Liberty. In the face of law or social pressure, Mill argued, individuals should have free rein in their opinions and behaviors, unless those behaviors harm other people. Mill’s goal was to make happiness available as widely as possible, supporting, as he put it in his autobiography, “the importance, to man and society…, of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions.”20

We now inhabit a world Mill never imagined, in which human nature can be expanded—or restricted—by emerging neurotechnology. Imagine yourself in this scenario, in a future that is closer than many of us realize:

You’re in the zone; even you can’t believe how productive you’ve been. Your memo is finished and sent, your in-box is under control, and you’re feeling sharper than you have in a decade. Sensing your joy, your playlist shifts to your favorite song, sending chills up your spine as the music begins to play. You glance at the program running in the background on your computer screen and notice a now-familiar sight that appears whenever you’re overloaded with pleasure: your theta brain wave activity decreasing in the right central and right temporal regions of your brain.

You mentally move the cursor to the left and scroll through your brain data over the past few hours. You can see your stress levels rising as the deadline to finish your memo approached, causing your beta brain wave activity to peak right before an alert popped up, telling you to TAKE A BRAIN BREAK. But what’s that unusual change in your brain activity when you’re asleep? It started earlier in the month. You compose a text to your doctor in your mind and send it with a mental swipe of your cursor: “Could you take a quick look at my brain data? Anything to worry about?”

Your mind starts to wander to the new colleague on your team, whom you know you shouldn’t be daydreaming about, given the company’s policy on intra-office romance. But you can’t help fantasizing just a little. You let yourself enjoy the moment and wonder if his brain aligns well with yours. Then you start to worry that your boss will notice your amorous feelings when she checks your brain activity, and shift your attention back to the present. You breathe a sigh of relief when the email she sends you later that day congratulates you on your brain metrics from the past quarter, which have earned you another performance bonus. You head home, jamming to music, with your work-issued brain-sensing earbuds still in.

When you arrive at work the next day, a somber cloud has fallen over the office. Along with emails, text messages, and GPS location data, the government has subpoenaed every employee’s brain wave data from the past year. They have compelling evidence that one of your coworkers has committed massive wire fraud; now they are looking for his coconspirators. Your boss tells you they are looking for synchronized rhythms of brain activity between him and the people he has been working with. While you know you’re innocent of any crime, you’ve been secretly working with him on a new start-up venture. Shaking, you remove your earbuds and try to focus without them. You’re not sure you remember how.

Advances in neuroscience are taking us closer to a reality like this one, where individuals, companies, and government can hack and track our brains in ways that fundamentally impact our freedom to understand, shape, and define ourselves. Which confronts us with an unprecedented set of bioethical dilemmas:

Should we—or will we want to—directly track information gleaned from our own brains, or have that information filtered for us by a trusted intermediary instead, much as we count on medical doctors to make sense of an MRI or CT scan?

Is it cheating to enhance our brains with drugs or devices that help us to learn faster or concentrate longer than we otherwise could?

Does society have the right to prohibit us from slowing down our brains or extinguishing painful memories?

What will it mean if our thoughts and emotions are up for grabs, just like the rest of our data being commodified and sold by corporations?

Should employers be allowed to use that data as part of the growing trend of workplace surveillance?

Are there any limits to corporations targeting our brains with their products?

Does freedom of thought protect us from government tracking our brains and mental processes?

Will unlocking our brains open our minds to targeted assaults and hacking, and if so, how do we protect ourselves against that risk?

Is embracing neurotechnology necessary for the very survival of our species to compete against the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence?



This book navigates each of these dilemmas and more to help us expand our definition of liberty in the modern era to include our right to cognitive liberty—the right to self-determination over our brains and mental experiences.

Anyone who values their ability to have private thoughts and ruminations—an “inner world”—should care about cognitive liberty.

We are at a pivotal moment in human history, in which control of our brains can be enhanced or lost. We need to define the contours of cognitive liberty now or risk being too late to do so.

This book will give us the tools necessary to unpack a new right to cognitive liberty and the bundle of rights it includes—mental privacy, freedom of thought, and self-determination—while making accessible the exciting and often startling neuroscience of tracking and hacking the human brain: From how neuroscience is democratizing meditation to the coming age of neural interface and what that means to technologies that let us type on virtual keyboards and navigate virtual reality intuitively with our minds, and even detect a deadly glioblastoma before it spreads. New ways to help us focus, authenticate our identities, or interrogate our brains for crimes. How marketing companies are decoding our brains to sell us products and even tailor movies to our brains’ greatest desires. Drugs and devices that can make us work and learn smarter and faster, cure us of addiction and depression, maybe even alleviate human suffering. And how our brains are manipulated and even assaulted.

But these chapters also go further, putting the science in context—demonstrating why public understanding and dialogue about cognitive liberty is more important now than at any other point in history.

My interest in cognitive liberty goes to the very heart of who I am. It affects you just as deeply, but so far, the issue hasn’t sparked nearly so much concern as I believe it should. I suspect people are more or less complacent because they don’t yet understand or believe the far-reaching implications of these new technologies.

As an Iranian American with extended family still living in Iran, I have witnessed the chilling effect of government censorship and surveillance on individual liberties, but also the power of technology to mobilize people for change.

Thanks to many of the technologies I’ll discuss in this book, despite being a chronic migraineur, on most days I am flourishing. I’ve tried triptans, anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, brain enhancers, and brain diminishers. I’ve had neurotoxins injected into my head, my temples, my neck, and my shoulders; undergone electrical stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, MRIs, EEGs, fMRIs, and more. On a great day, I’m better than fine—in fact, I’m a little bit ahead of the curve, because the flip side of some of the brain treatments I’ll explore is their enhancing effects on other parts of the brain. At times this has given me pause, as I’ve wondered if my right to treat my migraines is giving me an unfair advantage, or if a stroke of insight is truly my own—or one I should credit to a drug instead.

How technology is used is crucial in defining our cognitive liberty. Exercising a choice to take drugs that changes my brain or to plug in to machines that allow doctors to read it is quite different from if I had been forcibly administered those drugs or if doctors had monitored me without my consent. With our DNA already up for grabs and our smartphones broadcasting our every move, our brains are increasingly the final frontier for privacy.

I worry about our laws’ ability to keep up with technological change. Take the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects freedom of speech. Does it also protect freedom of thought? Does it give us the freedom to alter our thoughts whenever and however we choose, or can the government or society put limitations on what we do with our own brains? What about the Fifth Amendment? What does it mean to be protected from self-incrimination when the government can hook you up to a machine and find out what’s in your mind, whether you want to share it or not? Can companies that we share our brain data with through their applications sell it to third parties? Right now, no laws prevent them from doing so.

Is it so far-fetched to imagine a society in which people are arrested based on their thoughts of committing a crime, as in the dystopian society in the movie Minority Report? In Indiana, an eighteen-year-old was charged with attempting to intimidate his school by posting a video of himself shooting people in the hallways … except the people were zombies and the video was of him playing an augmented reality video game. Was it really a projection of his intent or, as he insisted, just a game?

Our brains need special protections. If they can be hacked and tracked like all our other online activities and cell phone calls, if our brains are just as subject to data tracking and aggregation as our financial records and online shopping, then we’re on the cusp of something profoundly dangerous. But before you panic, I believe there are solutions—provided that we focus on the right things.

When it comes to privacy protections in general, trying to restrict the flow of information is both impossible and potentially limits the insights we can gain to address the leading causes of disability and human suffering. Instead, we should focus on securing rights and remedies against the misuse of information. If people have the right to decide how their brain data is shared, and more importantly, have legal redress if it is misused (say, to discriminate against them in an employment setting or in health care, or education), that will go a long way toward building trust. In many instances, we want to share more of our personal information. Aggregated data can tell us so much about our health and our well-being, but we need special protections to ensure our mental privacy.

We must establish the right to cognitive liberty—to protect our freedom of thought and rumination, mental privacy, and self-determination over our brains and mental experiences. This is the bundle of rights that makes up a new right to cognitive liberty, which can and should be recognized as part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has established mechanisms for the enforcement of international human rights and creates powerful norms that guide corporations and nations on the ethical uses of neurotechnology.

Neurotechnology has unprecedented power to either empower or oppress us. The choice is ours.
