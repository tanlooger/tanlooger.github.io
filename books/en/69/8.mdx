title: 8 Self-Intimacy
---




THE WOMAN STANDING on the railway platform, about to board a train, is horrified. Her husband has just asked her if she remembered to lock the kitchen door and she has realized that she did not. What does she do? Before uttering a word, her mouth drops open and she clasps a palm to one of her cheeks. Even as she starts to speak, the hand stays there, pressed against the side of her face. Then, after a few moments, it descends, and the next phase of the behaviour sequence begins. We will not follow it further, however; instead we will concentrate on that hand, for it is the clue to a whole new world of body intimacies – intimacies with oneself.

In her fleeting moment of horror, the woman on the platform gave herself the instantaneous self-comfort of a swift caress – the clasping of a cheek. Her sudden feeling of emotional distress drove her, unconsciously, to provide the soothing contact which, under other circumstances, a loved one’s hand might have offered, or which, long ago, her parents would have provided when she was a tiny, hurt child. Now, in place of a lover’s or a mother’s hand reaching out to touch her cheek, it is her own hand that flies up to make the contact. It does so automatically, unthinkingly, and without hesitation. In performing this act, her cheek has remained her cheek, but her hand has symbolically become someone else’s – the lover’s or the mother’s.

Self-contacts of this kind are a form of body intimacy that we hardly recognize as such, and yet they are fundamentally the same as the others discussed in previous chapters. They may appear to be ‘one-person’ acts, but in truth they are unconscious mimes of two-person acts, with part of the body being used to perform the contact movement of the imaginary companion. They are, in other words, pseudo-interpersonal.

In this respect they provide the fifth, and final, major source of body intimacies. The five can be illustrated as follows. (1) When we are feeling nervous or depressed, a loved one may attempt to reassure us by giving us a comforting hug or a squeeze of the hand. (2) In the absence of a loved one, it may have to be one of the specialist touchers, such as a doctor, who pats our arm and tells us not to worry. (3) If our only company is our pet dog or cat, we may take it in our arms and press our cheek to its furry body to feel the comfort of its warm touch. (4) If we are completely alone and some sinister noise startles us in the night, we may hug the bedclothes tightly around us to feel secure in their soft embrace. (5) If all else fails, we still have our own bodies, and we can hug, embrace, clasp and touch ourselves in a great variety of ways to help soothe away our fears.

If you spend some time as an observer, simply watching the way people behave, you will soon discover that acts of self-contact, or auto-contact, are extremely common, much more common than you might at first suppose. It would be wrong, however, to consider all these contacts as substitutes for interpersonal intimacies. Some of them have other functions. A man scratching an itch on his leg, for instance, is not doing it as a mime of someone else doing it to him. He is doing it as a simple act of self-cleaning, performed in its own right, with no hidden intimacy factor. It is important, therefore, not to overstate the case for self-intimacies. In order to put them into their true perspective, it is best to start out with a basic question, namely how and why do we touch our own bodies?

With this question in mind, I analysed several thousand examples of human actions involving self-contact. The first fact to emerge was that the head region was the most important area for receiving these contacts, and the hand the most important organ for giving them. Although the head is only a small part of the total surface area of the human body, it nevertheless received approximately half the total number of self-contacts.

Surveying these head contacts first, it was possible to identify 650 different types of action. This was done by recording which part of the hand was used, how it made the contact, and which part of the head was involved. It soon became clear that there were four major categories. (The first three, although interesting in their own right, do not directly concern us here and will only be mentioned briefly. Their inclusion is important, however, in order to make it clear that they must be kept separate and not confused with the true self-intimacies.) The four categories are as follows.

1. Shielding actions. The hand is brought up to the head to cut off or reduce input to the sense organs. The man who wants to hear less puts his hands over his ears. The man who wants to smell less holds his nose. If the light is too bright, he shields his eyes, and if he cannot bear the sight in front of him, he covers them completely. Similar actions are used to reduce output, as when a hand comes up to cover the mouth and thereby conceal a facial expression.

2. Cleaning actions. The hand is brought up to the head to perform a scratch, rub, pick, wipe, or some similar action. A variety of hair-tidying actions also come under this general heading. Some of these movements are genuine attempts to clean and tidy the head region, but in many instances they are ‘nervous’ actions, caused by emotional tensions, and are similar to the ‘displacement activities’ described by ethologists in other species.

3. Specialized signals. The hand is brought up to the head to perform a symbolic gesture of some kind. A man who says ‘I am fed up to here’ holds the back of his hand to the underside of his chin, indicating that he is so full of symbolic ‘food’ that he cannot take any more. A boy who ‘thumbs his nose’ presses his thumb to his nose and spreads his fingers out in the shape of a vertical fan. This insult originates from the symbolic act of imitating the comb of a fighting cock, which is how it has become a threatening gesture. This is also the reason why it is sometimes called ‘cocking a snook’. Another animal symbolism used as an insult in certain countries is making a pair of horns by holding the hands to the temples, with the forefingers raised and slightly curled. A common form of self-insult is aiming a forefinger at the temple and firing an imaginary gun.

4. Self-intimacies. The hand is brought up to the head to perform some action that copies or imitates an interpersonal intimacy. Surprisingly, no fewer than four-fifths of the different hand-to-head actions fall into this self-intimacy category. It seems as if the main reason we have for touching our heads is one of obtaining comfort from unconsciously mimed acts of being touched by someone else.

The most common form that this takes is resting part of the head on the hand, with the elbow of the arm in question in contact with a supporting surface, and the forearm acting as a prop to take the weight of the head. It could, of course, be argued that this simply indicates that the neck muscles are tired. A little close observation of these actions soon reveals, however, that physical exhaustion cannot account for the majority of cases.

In this action, the hand is being used as more than a hand. By providing it with support from the elbow, it has become something more solid, and seems instead to be acting as a substitute for the shoulder or chest of the imaginary ‘embracing companion’. When, as a child or a lover, we are held in another’s arms, we frequently rest the side of our face against their body and feel their soft warmth through the skin of our cheek. By resting the side of our face on our supported hand, we are able to re-create that feeling in their absence, and thereby give ourselves a welcome sensation of comfort and intimacy. Furthermore, since the origin of the act is suitably obscure, we can do this in public without any fear of being thought of as infantile. Sucking a thumb in imitation of childhood breast-feeding might do as well, but there the disguise would wear too thin, and so we tend to avoid it.

Clasping an unsupported hand to the head is also a common act, like the one in the example given of the woman on the railway platform. When this is done, the head cannot lean so heavily, and it appears as if this type of action is more related to the caressing or clasping of the face or hair that is often performed by the embracing companion as an embellishment of the general intimacy. Here, the hand is acting as a symbolic companion’s hand, rather than as a symbolic chest or shoulder.

The mouth is a region that receives a great deal of attention, but here the most common action is to touch it in some way with the fingers or thumb, rather than with the whole hand. When making oral contact, the fingers or thumb are being used as substitutes for the mother’s breast and nipple. Full thumb-sucking, as I have said, is rare; but modified, less obvious versions of it are common. The simplest modification, and one that is frequently seen, is the pressing of the tip of the thumb between the lips. It is not inserted into the mouth or sucked, but the comforting contact is there nevertheless. The tip, side or back of the forefinger is also used a great deal in this way, and it is often held in contact with the lips for a considerable period of time, while its worried owner gains reassurance from its presence, as dim, unconscious echoes from the infantile past make themselves felt in the brain.

As an elaboration of this form of mouth contact, the finger or thumb is sometimes gently and slowly rubbed across the surface of the lips, re-creating the movements of the baby’s mouth on the mother’s breast. At more intense moments of anxiety, knuckle-biting and nail-biting put in an appearance. When frustrated aggression is added to the act in this way, it can, in the case of nail-biting, become so persistent as to cause near-mutilation, with the nails bitten down to tiny stumps and the nearby skin chewed raw.

Of all the many different kinds of hand-to-head contact, the most common, in order of frequency, are: (1) jaw rest, (2) chin rest, (3) hair clasp, (4) cheek rest, (5) mouth touch and (6) temple rest. All are performed by both adult males and females, but in two cases there is a strong sexual bias. Hair-clasping is three times as common in women as men, and temple-resting is twice as common in men as in women.

If we leave the head and move down the body, we soon find other forms of self-intimacy. We are all familiar with the tragic newsreel scenes of the aftermath of a disaster such as an earthquake or a mine collapse. A distraught woman in such a situation does not merely clasp one hand to her cheek. The act would be inadequate under the circumstances. Instead she goes much further, hugging her body with her arms and rocking herself pathetically from side to side, as she sits outside the ruins of her home or waits desperately at the pit-head. If she and another sufferer do not find comfort in a mutual embrace, she responds by embracing herself and by rocking herself gently back and forth as her mother once would have done when she was a frightened infant.

This is an extreme case, but we all use a similar device almost every day of our lives, when we fold our arms across our chest. Because the situation is less intense, so is the action, and the folding of arms on the chest is a much weaker form of self-embrace than the full self-hug of misery. It nevertheless provides a mildly comforting sensation of self-intimacy and is typically seen in moments when we are slightly on the defensive. If we are talking in a group of semi-strangers, for example, at a party or some other social gathering, and one of them is coming rather ‘too close for comfort’, we regain some of our lost comfort by bringing up our arms and folding them across our chest. Usually we are hardly aware that we have performed the act, or that it has any relation to the movements around us, but the fact that it operates in this way has led to its use as an unconscious social signal. For instance, a man who wishes to block a doorway against intruders may stand in front of it, fold his arms across his chest and say, ‘No one is allowed inside.’ The act of arm-folding in this case, which comforts the man in question, begins to look positively threatening to those in front of him. It signals the fact that he is shutting them out of his embrace, and that he finds self-sufficient strength in his own private act of self-embrace.

Another act of intimacy we all indulge in daily is what can be described as ‘holding hands with ourself’. One hand acts as our own, while the other, which clasps or grasps it, acts as the hand of an imaginary companion. We do this in several ways, some more intense than others. When, for example, we are in a particularly strong hand-holding mood with a real companion, we often interlock our fingers with theirs, making the interaction somehow more binding and complex. Similarly, in the absence of such a companion, we can re-create this sensation by interlocking the fingers of our left hand with those of our right. At moments of tension this is sometimes done with such force that the flesh shows white with the great pressure we are unconsciously exerting.

Similar pressures are exerted lower down on the body when we sit with one leg twined tightly around the other. Leg-crossing again seems to provide us with a remarkable degree of self-comfort, providing, as it does, the reassuring pressure of one part of the body against another, and reminding us perhaps of the comforting pressure we felt on our legs when, in a clinging embrace, we straddled the bodies of our parents.

In Victorian times, ladies were expressly forbidden – by the official rules of etiquette then applying – to cross their legs in public or social situations. Victorian males were less restricted in this way, but they were, nevertheless, requested not to hug their knees or feet when performing the act. Today there are no such restrictions, and a random count of a large number of leg-crossings revealed that 53 per cent were female and 47 per cent male, so that no sex difference has survived the passage of time from the last century into this. Two sex differences do exist, however, in the form which the act takes. If it is done by placing the ankle of one leg on the knee or thigh of the other, then it is nearly always a male performance, presumably because for the female this means an undue amount of crotch-exposure. It is intriguing that this applies even where women are wearing trousers, so that it would appear that a trousered woman is still mentally wearing her skirt. The second difference concerns the position of the feet of the crossed legs. If the foot of the ‘upper’ leg remains in contact with the surface of the ‘lower’ leg after the legs have been crossed, then the performance is almost always a female one. (The exception to this rule is the low-level ankle/ankle cross, where there are no sex differences, and where the feet are almost bound to be touching one another because of the nature of the act.)

A more intimate form of leg contact is leg-hugging. At its highest intensity this involves bringing the thighs up and the chest down until the two meet. The pressure is increased by embracing the knees or lower legs with the arms. As an addition, the head is lowered on to the knees and the chin or side of the face rested there. In such cases, the bent-up legs are being used as the substitute for the trunk of the imaginary companion, with the knees acting as the chest or shoulders. This is predominantly a female act – of a number of cases recorded at random, 95 per cent were female and only 5 per cent male.

Another typically female action is the clasping of the thigh with the hand, a survey of a large number of such contacts revealing that 91 per cent were female and only 9 per cent male. There appears to be an erotic element present here, the female hand acting as if it were a man’s hand placed on her thigh in a sexual context, an act more typical of a courting male than a courting female.

In this survey of self-intimacies, it has nearly always been the hands and arms, and sometimes the legs, that have performed as the active organs, the ones making the contact, but there are a few exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, and again this is typically a female movement, the head is actively lowered on to one shoulder and pressed or rested there, the contact being made by the cheek, jaw or chin. Here it is the shoulder that is being used as the symbolic chest or shoulder of the imaginary companion. Another example concerns the tongue, which may be used to caress the lips, or some other part of the body, certain females even being capable of making contact with their own nipples in this way.

In addition to all these varied methods of making bodily contact with oneself, there is one important aspect of self-intimacy that remains to be discussed, and that is the auto-erotic stimulation usually referred to as masturbation. The word itself appears to be a corruption of manustuprare, ‘to defile with the hand’, and reflects the fact that the most common method of sexual self-stimulation involves a hand-genital contact. For males, this usually means grasping the penis with one hand and rhythmically raising and lowering the arm. The hand then takes on two simultaneous symbolic roles. Its movements up and down the penis mimic the male’s own pelvic thrusts, whilst with its grip it acts as a pseudo-vagina. For females, the equivalent action is the stroking of the clitoris with the fingers. Here the fingers are acting as substitutes for the rhythmic pressure applied indirectly to the clitoris by the pelvic thrusting of the male during copulation. Alternative methods for the female are the stroking of the labia or the rhythmic insertion of the fingers into the vagina, with the fingers then acting as a substitute penis. Another technique is thigh-rubbing, in which the thighs are squeezed together, with an alternating tightening and relaxing of the inner muscles to produce a rhythmic pressure on the compressed genitals.

Surveys carried out in the middle of the present century revealed that masturbation is an extremely common form of self-intimacy and is indulged in by the vast majority of individuals at some time in their lives. Although it has always been little more than a harmless substitute for the interpersonal act of copulation, social attitudes towards it have varied considerably at different times. It appears to be widely practised amongst so-called ‘primitive tribes’, but is usually referred to as something of a joke, indicating that the masturbator is a failed copulator.

An entirely different and much less healthy view was prevalent in our own cultures in earlier centuries, when serious attempts were made to suppress the activity completely. In the eighteenth century, masturbation was denounced as ‘the heinous sin of self-pollution’. In the nineteenth century, it became ‘the horrid and exhausting vice of self-abuse’, and young Victorian ladies were forbidden to wash their genitals in case the gentle friction of such an act, when regularly performed, ‘might induce impure thoughts’. The wicked French bidet was not allowed to cross the English Channel. In the early part of the twentieth century, masturbation declined in horror to the level of a ‘nasty habit’, but religious authorities were still seriously concerned that it might actually give some sensual reward to the masturbator. They did, however, allow that ‘the effusion of semen would be legitimate for medical purposes if only it could be achieved without causing pleasure’. By the middle of the twentieth century, attitudes had undergone a dramatic change, and it was at last boldly announced that masturbation is ‘a normal and healthy act for a person of any age’. In the past two decades this new approach has continued to gain ground to the point where, in 1971, a respectable women’s magazine was able to publish the following words of advice, words which would have astonished a Victorian reader: ‘Masturbation … is wholesome, normal and sound … you are training your body to become a superb instrument of love. Masturbate to your heart’s content.’

Today’s adolescent who, in the absence of copulatory opportunities, feels inclined to indulge in this form of sexual self-intimacy is lucky indeed. The adolescent of yesterday, far from being freely permitted to perform this activity, was often severely punished for doing so. During the past two centuries all kinds of harsh restraints have been applied, some of which we now find hard to believe. In some cases the young male offender was fitted with a silver ring that was slotted through holes pierced in his foreskin. Alternatively, he might have been equipped with a small penis-belt armed with spikes that automatically pricked the penis if it started to become erect. Blistering the penis with red mercury ointment was another ‘remedy’ that was sometimes recommended. Both sexes of maturing children were occasionally forced to sleep with their hands tied together or to the bed-posts, to prevent them from ‘playing with themselves’ at night, or were equipped with modern versions of chastity-belts. Young females might be forced to suffer the mutilation of having the clitoris cauterized or completely removed by surgery, and circumcision for males was advised by some medical authorities as an imagined aid to stamping out the ‘evil act’ of self-stimulation.

Happily, with the single exception of male circumcision, none of these painful hazards has survived to the present day as a common practice. Society’s age-old urge to mutilate its growing juveniles seems, at long last, to be under control. Bearing this in mind, it is worth digressing for a moment to consider why the curious ritual of circumcision should have escaped this general change of attitude. Today the anti-masturbatory excuse is no longer given. Instead, the foreskin of the male infant is amputated for ‘religious, medical or hygienic’ reasons. The frequency of the operation varies from country to country; in Britain it is thought to be performed on fewer than half the male babies born, whereas in the United States a figure as high as 85 per cent has been quoted.

The medical reason given in favour of foreskin-removal is that it eliminates certain (extremely rare) disease dangers. These only occur, however, if the unmutilated adult male fails to keep his penis reasonably clean by the simple act of pulling back the foreskin and washing the tip of the organ. If this is done regularly, there is, according to medical authorities, no more of a health risk for an uncircumcised male than for a circumcised one. Since the vast majority of foreskin removals are not performed for religious reasons, and since the medical grounds are hardly worth considering, the true reason for the thousands of sexual mutilations carried out on male babies each year remains something of a mystery. Referred to recently by one doctor in America as ‘the rape of the phallus’, it appears to be a hang-over from our distant cultural past. It has, since early times, been a common practice in most African tribes and was adopted by the ancient Egyptians, whose priest-doctors made sure that no self-respecting male retained his foreskin. Because of the social stigma attached to an attached foreskin, the Jews borrowed the circumcision ritual from the Egyptians and made it even more obligatory for the male members of their religion. In becoming a social or religious ‘law’, the original significance of the operation had already been forgotten, and it is not easy today to trace it back to its source. Even amongst the African tribes where it is part of elaborate initiation ceremonies, it is usually merely referred to as being ‘the custom’, but a number of explanations have been forthcoming from modern investigators. One suggestion is that the male foreskin was considered to be a feminine attribute, presumably because it covered up the head of the male organ in the way that the female labia cover the female genital opening. By the same argument, the female’s clitoris was considered to be a masculine organ, so that when boys and girls reached sexual maturity, they were both made more true to their sex by having the offending opposite-sex attributes removed. Another suggestion is that the shedding of the foreskin was a symbolic imitation of the shedding of a snake’s skin, an action that was widely thought to endow that reptile with immortality, since it reappeared so shining and bright after each shedding. The symbolic equation was straightforward enough: snake = phallus, therefore snakeskin = foreskin.

These and many other ingenious explanations have been put forward, but all seem to be inadequate when the phenomenon of sexual mutilation is viewed as a whole. It has occurred at some time or another in almost every corner of the globe, in literally hundreds of different cultures, and the precise form it has taken has varied considerably. It does not always involve simple foreskin or clitoris removal. In certain cases the parts removed are more extensive, or the mutilations are slits and cuts rather than amputations. In some tribes the female may be stripped of her labia as well as her clitoris, and in others the male may suffer the painful loss of the entire skin surface covering the lower belly, pelvis, scrotum and inner legs, or he may be subjected to the ordeal of having his penis split in two, down its whole length. The only overall common factor seems to be the act by human adults of perpetrating mechanical damage to the genitals of their juniors.

That this ancient form of adult aggression should have survived into present times in the form of male circumcision is something that might bear closer examination by the modern medical profession. Not since the anti-masturbatory assaults of the last century have young females been attacked in this way, presumably because, unlike the males, there was no hygienic justification left for the removal of any part of their genitals. It is fortunate that the situation was not reversed, for if the clitoris could have been proved to be unhygienic and a suitable medical excuse therefore found for its removal, the female would have suffered a considerable loss of sexual responsiveness. Recent careful tests have shown that the penis, by contrast, suffers little or no loss of sensitivity as a result of foreskin-removal, so that males who are mutilated in this way by the respectable modern equivalents of the ancient witch-doctors do not, at least, experience any reduction of sexual performance. These modern tests do, of course, make complete nonsense of the earlier, anti-masturbatory reason for surgically removing the foreskin. Mutilated or unmutilated, the adult male is still going to be able to obtain an unhindered sexual reward from his solitary indulgences in genital self-intimacy.

Summing up, then, it can be said that the reason why male circumcision has survived so widely, when virtually all other forms of archaic genital dismembering have been abandoned in ‘civilized’ communities, is that it is the only one which does not impair sexual activity and which, at the same time, has been able to acquire a respectable whitewash of medical rationalization.

Returning to masturbation itself, there only remains the question of whether, in the new-found self-stimulation freedom of the latter half of the twentieth century, there are any future hazards waiting in store for us. If we are all advised to ‘masturbate to our heart’s content’ by popular magazine articles, has the pendulum of sexual opinion swung too far? Clearly the earlier rubbish about masturbation causing untold misery and sickness had to be thrown out with a vigorous propaganda campaign, and this has now successfully been done; but is there perhaps a danger that, in sweeping the ridiculous old ideas away, we may go too far in the opposite direction? Masturbation is, after all, a second-rate form of intimacy, like all the substitute social activities discussed in previous chapters. Anything done alone that is a mimic of something done with a companion must, of necessity, be inferior to the genuine act of body intimacy, and this rule must apply to masturbation as much as to any other form of self-intimacy. When there is nothing better available, then of course no justifiable argument can be brought against these substitute activities; but supposing something better is hoped for in the near future, is there not a danger of developing a fixation on the inferior substitute acts which later makes it more difficult to effect a transfer to the real thing?

Contemporary words of advice to a masturbating female stress that every woman should develop her own individual masturbation style, and that it is important to set aside several hours a week so that the new response pattern will become a stable one. She is informed that when she has educated her body in this way she will be able to guide the male, when making love, to positions that give her the maximum sensations. At least this approach is honest: the female works out and stabilizes her self-reward pattern and then it is up to the male partner to service her accordingly. This is recommended as a method of training the female body to become ‘a superb instrument of love’. As a system for providing considerable sexual reward for a lonely or frustrated female it may be excellent, but as a system for enhancing love it perhaps leaves something to be desired. It overlooks completely the fact that human copulation is much more than an act of mutual sexual servicing. To approach a moment of intense, reciprocal body intimacy with a previously fixed pattern of reward-demand is to put the cart before the horse. It is no better than using the male’s actions as substitutes for masturbation, rather than the other way around. Similarly, if a male has become too heavily fixated on a particular kind of manual masturbation, he may end up using the female vagina as a substitute for his hand, instead of the reverse. To approach copulation in this way is to reduce the partner to a small stimulation device, instead of a complete, intimate and loving person. Over-emphasis on the importance of advanced masturbatory techniques is therefore not perhaps as entirely innocent as the ‘new liberalism’ would have us believe.

This said, however, it cannot be stressed too strongly that such a warning must in no way be taken as an excuse for a return to the guilt-ridden restrictions of yesterday’s forbidden self-intimacies. If the pendulum has perhaps swung a little too far, we are still in a much better position than our immediate ancestors, and we should be grateful for the sexual reformers of the twentieth century who have made this possible. In all probability the dangers of self-intimate fixations will not usually be too serious. If two people come to love one another sufficiently, the emotional intensity of their relationship stands a good chance of sweeping away the rigidity of their previous, solitary patterns of self-gratification, and allowing an increasingly free growth of the sexual interactions that occur between them. If their relationship is less intense and this does not happen, then they will at least be able to enjoy a mutual exchange of their stylized erotic stimulations, which is a good deal better than the Victorian situation, where the marriage partners felt themselves obliged to ‘get the nasty business over’ as quickly as possible before falling gratefully asleep.
