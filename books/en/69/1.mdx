title: 1 The Roots of Intimacy
---




AS AN ADULT human being, you can communicate with me in a variety of ways. I can read what you write, listen to the words you speak, hear your laughter and your cries, look at the expressions on your face, watch the actions you perform, smell the scent you wear and feel your embrace. In ordinary speech we might refer to these interactions as ‘making contact’, or ‘keeping in touch’, and yet only the last one on the list involves bodily contact. All the others operate at a distance. The use of words like ‘contact’ and ‘touch’ to cover such activities as writing, vocalization and visual signalling is, when, considered objectively, strange and rather revealing. It is as if we are automatically accepting that bodily contact is the most basic form of communication.

There are further examples of this. For instance, we often refer to ‘gripping experiences’, ‘touching scenes’ or ‘hurt feelings’, and we talk of a speaker who ‘holds his audience’. In none of these cases is there an actual physical grip, touch, feel or hold, but this does not seem to matter. The use of physical-contact metaphors provides a satisfying way of expressing the various emotions involved in the different contexts.

The explanation is simple enough. In early childhood, before we could speak or write, body contact was a dominant theme. Direct physical interaction with the mother was all-important and it left its mark. Still earlier, inside the womb, before we could see or smell, leave alone speak or write, it was an even more powerful element in our lives. If we are to understand the many curious and often strongly inhibited ways in which we make physical contact with one another as adults, then we must start by returning to our earliest beginnings, when we were no more than embryos inside our mothers’ bodies. It is the intimacies of the womb, which we hardly ever consider, that will help us to understand the intimacies of childhood, which we tend to ignore because we take them so much for granted, and it is the intimacies of childhood, re-examined and seen afresh, that will help us to explain the intimacies of adult life, which so often confuse, puzzle and even embarrass us.

The very first impressions we receive as living beings must be sensations of intimate body contact, as we float snugly inside the protective wall of the maternal uterus. The major input to the developing nervous system at this stage therefore takes the form of varying sensations of touch, pressure and movement. The entire skin surface of the unborn child is bathed in the warm uterine liquid of the mother. As the child grows and its swelling body presses harder against the mother’s tissues, the soft embrace of the enveloping bag of the womb becomes gradually stronger, hugging tighter with each passing week. In addition, throughout this period the growing baby is subjected to the varying pressure of the rhythmic breathing of the maternal lungs, and to a gentle, regular swaying motion whenever the mother walks.

Towards the end of pregnancy, in the last three months before birth, the baby is also capable of hearing. There is still nothing to see, taste or smell, but things that go bump in the night of the womb can be clearly detected. If a loud, sharp noise is made near to the mother’s belly, it startles the baby inside and makes it jump. The movement can easily be recorded by sensitive instruments and may even be strong enough for the mother to feel it herself. This means that during this period before birth the baby is undoubtedly capable of hearing the steady thump of the maternal heartbeat, 72 times every minute. It will become imprinted as the major sound-signal of life in the womb.

These, then, are our first real experiences of life – floating in a warm fluid, curling inside a total embrace, swaying to the undulations of the moving body and hearing the beat of the pulsing heart. Our prolonged exposure to these sensations in the absence of other, competing stimuli leaves a lasting impression on our brains, an impression that spells security, comfort and passivity.

This intra-uterine bliss is then rudely and rapidly shattered by what must be one of the most traumatic experiences in our entire lives – the act of being born. The uterus, in a matter of hours, is transformed from a cosy nest into a straining, squeezing sac of muscle, the largest and most powerful muscle in the whole human body, athlete’s arms included. The lazy embrace that became a snug hug now becomes a crushing constriction. The newly delivered baby displays, not a happy, welcoming grin, but the strained, tightly contorted facial expressions of a desperate torture victim. Its cries, which are such sweet music to the anxiously waiting parents, are in reality nothing short of the wild screams of blind panic, as it is exposed to the sudden loss of intimate body contact.

At the moment of birth the baby appears floppy, like soft, wet rubber, but almost at once it makes a gasping action and takes its first breath. Then, five to six seconds later, it starts to cry. Its head, legs and arms begin to move about with increasing intensity and for the next thirty minutes it continues to protest in irregular outbursts of limb-thrashing, grasping, grimacing and screaming, after which it usually subsides exhausted into a long sleep.fn1

The drama is over for the moment, but when the baby reawakens it is going to need a great deal of maternal care, contact and intimacy to compensate it for the lost comforts of the womb. These post-uterine substitutes are provided by the mother, or those who are helping her, in a number of ways. The most obvious one is the replacement of the embrace of the womb by the embrace of the mother’s arms. The ideal maternal embrace enfolds the baby, bringing as much of its body surface into contact with the mother as is possible without restricting breathing. There is a great difference between embracing the baby and merely holding it. An awkward adult who holds the infant with a minimum of contact will soon discover how dramatically this reduces the comforting value of the action. The maternal chest, arms and hands must do their best to re-create the total engulfment of the lost womb.

Sometimes the embrace alone is not enough. Other womb-like elements have to be added. Without knowing quite why, the mother starts to rock her child gently from side to side. This has a strong soothing effect, but if it fails she may get up and start slowly walking back and forth with the baby cradled in her arms. From time to time she may joggle it up and down briefly. All these intimacies have a comforting influence on a restless or crying child, and they do so, it seems, because of the way they copy certain of the rhythms experienced earlier by the unborn baby. The most obvious guess is that they succeed by re-creating the gentle swaying motions felt inside the womb whenever the mother walked about during her pregnancy. But there is a catch to this. The speed is wrong. The rate of rocking is considerably slower than the rate of normal walking. Furthermore, ‘walking the baby’ is also done at a pace that is much slower than an average walk of the ordinary kind.

Experiments were carried out recently to ascertain the ideal rocking speed for a cradle. At very low or very high speeds the movements had little or no soothing effect, but when the mechanically operated cradle was set at between sixty and seventy rocks per minute there was a striking change, the babies under observation immediately becoming much calmer and crying much less. Although mothers vary somewhat in the speed at which they rock their babies when they hold them in their arms, the typical maternal rocking rate is much the same as that in the experiments, and the pace when ‘walking the baby’ is also in that region. An average walking rate under ordinary circumstances, however, usually exceeds a hundred paces per minute.

It seems, therefore, that although these comforting actions may well soothe by virtue of the way they copy the swaying motions felt inside the womb, the speed at which they are carried out requires some other explanation. There are two rhythmic experiences available to the unborn child, apart from the mother’s walking: the steady rise and fall of her chest as she breathes, and the steady thump of her heartbeat. The breathing rate is much too slow to be considered, being roughly between ten and fourteen respirations per minute, but the heartbeat speed, at 72 beats per minute, looks like the ideal candidate. It appears as if this rhythm, whether heard or felt, is the vital comforter, reminding the baby vividly of the lost paradise of the womb.

There are two other pieces of evidence that support this view. First, the recorded heartbeat sound, if played experimentally to babies at the correct speed, also has a calming effect, even without any rocking or swaying movement. If the same sound is played faster, at over a hundred beats per minute – that is, at the speed of normal walking – it immediately ceases to have any calming effect. Second, as I reported in The Naked Ape, careful observations have revealed that the vast majority of mothers hold their babies in such a way that their infants’ heads are pressed to the left breast, close to the maternal heart. Even though these mothers are unaware of what they are doing, they are nevertheless successfully placing their babies’ ears as close as possible to the source of the heartbeat sound. This applies to both right-handed and left-handed mothers, so that the heartbeat explanation appears to be the only one that fits.

Clearly this is susceptible to commercial exploitation by anyone who takes the trouble to manufacture a cradle that can be mechanically rocked at heartbeat speed, or that is equipped with a small machine that plays a non-stop amplified recording of the normal heartbeat sound. A de luxe model incorporating both devices would no doubt be even more effective, and many a harassed mother could simply switch on and relax as it automatically and relentlessly calmed her baby to sleep, just as her washing machine so efficiently deals with the baby’s dirty clothing.

Inevitably it is only a matter of time before such machines do appear on the market, and undoubtedly they will do a great deal to assist the busy mother of modern times, but there is an inherent danger in their use if it becomes excessive. It is true that mechanical calming is better than no calming, both for the mother’s nerves and for the baby’s well-being, and where demands on the mother’s time are so heavy that she has no other choice, then mechanical calming will certainly be advantageous. But old-fashioned maternal calming is always going to be better than its mechanical replacement. There are two reasons for this. First, the mother does more than the machine could ever do. Her comforting actions are more complex and contain special features that we have yet to discuss. Second, the intimate interaction between mother and child that occurs whenever she comforts it by carrying, embracing and rocking it provides the important foundation for the strong bond of attachment that will soon grow between them. True, during its first months after birth the baby will respond positively to any friendly adult. It accepts any intimacies from any individual who offers them, regardless of who they are. After a year has passed, however, the child will have learned its own mother and will have started to reject intimacies from strangers. This change is known to occur around the fifth month in most babies, but it does not happen overnight and there is great variability from child to child. It is therefore difficult to predict with certainty the exact moment at which the infant will begin to respond selectively to its own mother. It is a critical time, because the strength and quality of the later bond of attachment will depend on the richness and intensity of the body-contact behaviour that occurs between mother and infant at just this threshold phase.

Obviously, excessive use of mechanical mothers during this vital stage could be dangerous. Some mothers imagine that it is the provision of food and other similar rewards that make the baby become attached to them, but this is not so. Observations of deprived children and careful experiments with monkeys have shown conclusively that it is instead the tender intimacies with the soft body of the mother which are vital in producing the essential bond of attachment that will be so important for successful social behaviour in later life. It is virtually impossible to give too much body-loving and contact during these critical early months, and the mother who ignores this fact will suffer for it later, as will her child. It is difficult to comprehend the warped tradition which says that it is better to leave a small baby to cry so that it does not ‘get the better of you’, which is encountered all too often in our civilized cultures.

To counterbalance this statement, however, it must be added that when the child is older, the situation changes. It then becomes possible for the mother to be over-protective and to hold her child back just when it should be striking out and becoming more independent. The worst twist that can happen is for a mother to be under-protective, strict and disciplinary with a tiny infant, and then over-protective and clinging with an older child. This completely reverses the natural order of bond development, and sadly it is a sequence that is frequently observed today. If an older child, or adolescent, ‘rebels’, this twisted pattern of rearing is very likely to be found lurking in the background. Unfortunately, by the time this happens it is a little late in the day to correct the early damage that has been done.

The natural sequence I have described here – love first, freedom later – is basic not only to man, but also to all the other higher primates. Monkey mothers and ape mothers keep up the body-contact intimacies non-stop from the moment of birth for many weeks. They are greatly aided, of course, by the fact that baby monkeys and apes are strong enough to cling to them for long periods of time without assistance. In the great apes, such as the gorilla, the babies may take a few days to get started as active clingers, but after that, despite their weight, they manage it with remarkable tenacity. The smaller monkeys cling from the moment of birth, and I have even seen one half-born baby clutching tightly with its hands to the body of its mother during delivery, while the rear part of it was still inside the womb.

The human baby is much less athletic. Its arms are weaker and its short-toed feet are clingless. It therefore poses a much greater problem for the human mother. Throughout the early months it is she who must perform all the physical actions that serve to keep her and her baby in bodily contact. Only a few fragments of the infant’s ancestral clinging pattern remain, rudimentary reminders of its ancient, evolutionary past, and even these are of no practical use today. They last for little more than two months after birth and are known as the grasp reflex and the Moro reflex.

The grasp reflex arrives early, the sixth-month-old foetus already having a strong grip. At birth, stimulation of the palm results in a tight clasping of the hand, and the grasp is strong enough for an adult to lift the whole weight of the baby’s body in this way. Unlike the young monkey, however, this clinging cannot be sustained for any length of time.

The Moro reflex can be demonstrated by sharply and swiftly lowering the baby through a short distance – as if it were being dropped – while supporting it under its back. The infant’s arms quickly fling outwards, with the hands opening and the fingers spreading wide. Then the arms come together again, as if groping for an embrace to steady itself. Here we can see clearly the ghost of the ancestral primate clinging action that is employed so effectively by every healthy young monkey. Recent studies have shown this even more clearly. If the baby feels itself dropping down while at the same time its hands are held and allowed to grasp, its reaction is not first to fling its arms wide before making the embracing action, but simply to go straight into the tight clinging response. This is precisely what a startled young monkey would do if it were grasping lightly on to the fur of its resting mother, who then suddenly leapt up in alarm. The infant monkey would instantly tighten its grip in this way, ready to be carried off rapidly by the mother to safety. The human baby, until it is eight weeks old, still has enough of the monkey left in it to show us a remnant of this response.

From the human mother’s point of view, however, these ‘monkey’ reactions are of no more than academic interest. They may intrigue zoologists, but they do nothing in practical terms to lighten the parental burden. How, then, can she deal with the situation? There are several alternatives. In most so-called primitive cultures, the baby is almost constantly in touch with the mother’s body during its early months. When the mother is resting, the baby is held all the time, either by herself or by someone else. When she sleeps, it shares her bed. When she works or moves about, it is carried strapped firmly to her body. In this way she manages to provide the almost non-stop contact typical of other primates. But modern mothers cannot always go to such lengths.

An alternative is to swathe the unheld baby in a sheath of clothes. If the mother cannot offer the baby the snug embrace of her arms or close contact with her body, day and night, hour after hour, she can at least provide it with the snug embrace of a wrapping of smooth, soft clothing, as an aid to replacing the lost engulfment of the womb. We usually think of clothing the baby merely as an act of keeping it warm, but there is more to it than this. The embrace of the material, as it wraps around and makes contact with the body surface of the infant, is equally important. Whether this wrapping should be loose or firm, however, remains a hotly debated point. Cultures vary considerably in their attitude towards the ideal tightness of this post-natal cloth-womb.

In the Western world today, tight swaddling is generally frowned upon, and the baby, even when new-born, is wrapped only lightly, so that it can move its body and limbs freely if it feels so inclined. Experts have expressed the fear that ‘it might cramp the child’s spirit’ to wrap it more firmly. The vast majority of Western readers would instantly agree with this comment, but it does bear looking at more closely. The ancient Greeks and Romans swaddled their babies, yet even the most fanatical anti-swaddler would have to admit that there were quite a few uncramped spirits among their number. British babies, up to the end of the eighteenth century, were swaddled, and many Russian, Yugoslav, Mexican, Lapp, Japanese and American Indian babies are still swaddled at the present day. Recently the matter was examined scientifically, with both swaddled and unswaddled babies checked for discomfort by sets of sensitive instruments. The conclusions were that swaddling did in fact make the babies less fretful, as was shown by reduced heartbeat rate, breathing rate and crying frequency. Sleep, on the other hand, was increased. Presumably this is because the tight wrapping is more reminiscent of the tight womb-hug experienced by the advanced foetus during the final weeks of its gestation.

If this appears to be entirely in favour of the swaddlers, it should nevertheless be remembered that even the bulkiest, most belly-swelling foetus is never so tightly hugged by the womb that it cannot manage occasional kicks and struggles. Any mother who has felt these movements inside her will be aware that she is not ‘swaddling’ her unborn infant to the point of total immobility. A moderately close swaddling after birth is therefore probably more natural than the really tight binding that is applied in some cultures. Furthermore, swaddlers tend to prolong unnecessarily the close wrapping of their infants, well beyond the point where it is advisable. It may be helpful during the earliest weeks, but if it is extended over a period of months it may start to interfere with the healthy growing processes of muscular and postural development. Just as the foetus has to leave the real womb, so the new-born must soon leave the cloth-womb, if it is not to become ‘overdue’ at its next stage of maturation. We normally speak of babies being premature or overdue only in relation to the moment of their birth, but it is useful to apply this same concept to the later stages of childhood development as well. At each phase, from infancy to adolescence, there are relevant forms of intimacy, of bodily contact and caring, that should occur between parent and child if the offspring is to pass through the various stages successfully. If the intimacy offered by the parent at any particular stage is either too advanced or too retarded for that particular stage, then trouble may ensue later.

Up to this point we have been looking at some of the ways in which the mother helps her baby to relive some of its womb-time intimacies, but it would be wrong to give the impression that comforts during the early post-birth phase are no more than prolongations of foetal comforts. Such extensions provide only one part of the picture. Other interactions are taking place at the same time. The baby stage has its own, new forms of comfort to be added. They include fondling, kissing and stroking by the mother, and the cleaning of the baby’s body surface with gentle, tactile manipulations such as rubbing, wiping and other mild frictions. Also, there is more to the embrace than merely embracing. In addition to offering the overall enveloping pressure of her arms, the mother frequently does something else. She pats the baby rhythmically with one of her hands. This patting action is restricted largely to one region of the baby’s body, namely the back. It is delivered at a characteristic speed, and with a characteristic strength, neither too weak nor too strong. To call it a ‘burping’ action is misleading. It is a much more widespread and basic response of the mother’s, and is not limited to that one specific form of infantile discomfort. Whenever the baby seems to need a little extra comforting, the mother embellishes her simple embrace by the addition of back-patting. Frequently she adds swaying or rocking movements at the same time, and often coos or croons softly with her mouth held near to the baby’s head. The importance of these early comforting actions is considerable, for, as we shall see later, they reappear in many forms, sometimes obvious, sometimes heavily disguised, in the various intimacies of adult human life. They are so automatic to the mother that they are seldom thought about or discussed, with the result that the transformed roles they play in later life are usually overlooked.

In origin, the patting action is what students of animal behaviour refer to as an intention movement. This can best be illustrated by giving an animal example. When a bird is about to fly, it bobs its head as part of the action of taking off. During evolution this head-bobbing may become exaggerated as a signal to other birds that it is about to depart. It may perform vigorous, repeated head-bobs for some time before actually taking off, giving its companions the warning message that it is about to leave and enabling them to be ready to accompany it. In other words, it signals its intention to fly, and the head-bobbing is referred to as an intention movement. Patting by human mothers appears to have evolved as a special contact signal in a similar way, being a repeated intention movement of tight clinging. Each pat of the mother’s hand says, ‘See, this is how I will cling tightly to you to protect you from danger, so relax, there is nothing to worry about.’ Each pat repeats the signal and helps to soothe the baby. But there is more to it than this. Again, the example of the bird can help. If the bird is mildly alarmed, but not sufficiently to fly away, it can alert its companions simply by giving a few mild head-bobs, but without actually taking off. In other words, the intention-movement signal can be given by itself, without being carried through into the full action of flight. This is what has happened with the human patting action. The hand pats the back, then stops, then pats again, then stops again. It is not carried through into the full danger-protection clinging action. So the message from the mother to the baby reads not only ‘Don’t worry, I will cling to you like this if danger threatens,’ but also ‘Don’t worry, there is no danger, or I would be clinging to you tighter than this.’ The repeated patting is therefore doubly soothing.

The signal of the softly cooing or humming voice soothes in another way. Again, an animal illustration may help. When certain fish are in an aggressive mood, they indicate this by lowering the head-end of the body and raising the tail-end. If the same fish are signalling that they are definitely not aggressive, they do the exact opposite, that is, they raise the head and lower the tail. The soft cooing of the mother works on this same antithesis principle. Loud, harsh sounds are alarm signals for our species, as they are for many others. Screams, shouts, snarls and roars are widespread mammalian messages of pain, danger, fear and aggression. By employing tonal qualities which are the antithesis of these sounds, the human mother can, as it were, signal the opposite of these messages, namely, that all is well. She may use verbal messages in her cooing and crooning, but the words are, of course, of little importance. It is the soft, sweet, smooth tonal qualities of the cooing that transmit the vital, comforting signal to the infant.

Another important new, post-womb pattern of intimacy is the presentation of the nipple (or bottle-teat) for sucking by the baby. Its mouth experiences the intrusion of a soft, warm, rubbery shape from which it can squeeze a sweet, warm liquid. Its mouth senses the warmth, its tongue tastes the sweetness, and its lips feel the softness. Another very basic comfort – a primary intimacy – has been added to its life. Again, it is one that will reappear in many disguises later, in adult contexts.

These, then, are the most important intimacies of the baby phase of the human species. The mother embraces her offspring, carries, rocks, pats, fondles, kisses, strokes, cleans and suckles it, and coos, hums and croons to it. The baby’s only really positive contact action at this early stage is to suck, but it does have two vital signals that act as invitations to intimacy and encourage the mother to perform her close-contact actions. These signals are crying and smiling. Crying initiates contact and smiling helps to maintain it. Crying says ‘come here’ and smiling says ‘please stay’.

The act of crying is sometimes misunderstood. Because it is used when the baby is hungry, uncomfortable or in pain, it is assumed that these are the only messages it carries. If a baby cries, a mother often automatically concludes that one of these three problems must exist, but this is not necessarily the case. The message says only ‘come here’; it does not say why. If a baby is well fed, comfortable and in no pain, it may still cry, simply to initiate intimate contact with the mother. If the mother feeds it, makes sure there is no discomfort, and then puts it down again, it may immediately restart its crying signal. All this means, in a healthy baby, is that it has not had its quota of intimate bodily contact, and it will go on protesting until it gets it. In the early months the demand is high, and the baby is fortunate in having a powerful attraction-signal in its happy smile, to reward the mother for her labours.

Amongst primates, the smile of the human baby is unique. Monkey and ape babies do not have it. They simply do not need it, because they are strong enough to cling on to their mother’s fur and stay close to her in this way by virtue of their own actions. The human baby cannot do this and somehow has to make itself more appealing to the mother. The smile has been evolution’s answer to the problem.

Crying and smiling are both backed up by secondary signals. Human crying starts out in a monkey-like way. When a baby monkey cries, it produces a series of rhythmic screaming sounds, but sheds no tears. During the first few weeks after birth, the human baby cries in the same tearless way, but after this initial period, weeping is added to the vocal signal. Later, in adult life, the weeping can occur separately, by itself, as a silent signal, but for the infant it is essentially a combined act. For some reason, man’s uniqueness as a weeping primate has seldom been commented on, but clearly it must have some specific significance for our species. Primarily it is, of course, a visual signal and is enhanced by the hairlessness of our cheeks, on which tears can glisten and trickle so conspicuously. But another clue comes from the mother’s response, which is usually to ‘dry the eyes’ of her infant. This entails a gentle wiping away of the tears from the skin of the face – a soothing act of intimate body contact. Perhaps this is an important secondary function of the dramatically increased secretion of the lachrymal glands that so often floods the face of the young human animal.

If this seems far-fetched, it is worth remembering that the human mother, as in many other species, has a strong basic urge to clean the body of her offspring. When it wets itself with urine, she dries it, and it is almost as if copious tears have evolved as a kind of ‘substitute urine’ serving to stimulate a similar intimate response at times of emotional distress. Unlike urine, tears do not help to remove waste products from the body. At low levels of secretion they clean and protect the eyes, but during full weeping their only function appears to be that of transmitting social signals, and they then justify a purely behavioural interpretation. As with smiling, the encouragement of intimacy seems to be their main business.

Smiling is supported by the secondary signals of babbling and reaching. The infant grins, gurgles and stretches out its arms towards its mother in an intention movement of clinging to her, inviting her to pick it up. The mother’s response is to reciprocate. She smiles back, ‘babbles’ to the baby, and reaches out her own arms to touch it or lift it. Like weeping, the smiling complex does not appear until about the second month after birth. In fact, the first month could well be called the ‘monkey phase’, the specifically human signals appearing only after these first few weeks have passed.

As the baby moves on into its third and fourth months, new patterns of body contact begin to appear. The early ‘monkey’ actions of the grasp reflex and the Moro reflex disappear and are replaced by more sophisticated forms of directed grasping and clinging. In the case of the primitive grasp reflex, the baby’s hand automatically took hold of any object pressed into it, but now the new, selective grasping becomes a positive action in which the infant co-ordinates its eyes and its hands, reaching out for and grabbing a particular object that catches its attention. Frequently this is part of the mother’s body, especially her hair. Directed grasping of this kind is usually perfected by the fifth month of life.

In a similar way, the automatic, undirected clinging movements of the Moro reflex make way for orientated hugging in which the baby clings specifically to the mother’s body, adjusting its movements to her position. Directed clinging is normally established by the sixth month.

Leaving the baby stage behind and passing on to the later period of childhood, it becomes obvious that there is a steady decline in the extent of primary bodily intimacy. The need for security, which extensive body contact with the parent has satisfied so well, meets a growing competitor, namely the need for independent action, for discovering the world, for exploring the environment. Clearly this cannot be done from the encompassing circle of the mother’s arms. The infant must strike out. Primary intimacy must suffer. But the world is still a frightening place, and some form of indirect, remote-control intimacy is needed to maintain the sense of security and safety while independence is asserting itself. Tactile communication has to give way to increasingly sensitive visual communication. The baby has to replace the confining, hampering security of the embrace and the cuddle with the less restricting device of exchanged facial expressions. The shared hug makes way for the shared smile, the shared laugh, and all the other subtle facial postures of which the human being is capable. The smiling face, which earlier was an invitation to an embrace, now replaces it. The smile, in effect, becomes itself a symbolic embrace, operating at a distance. This enables the infant to function more freely and yet, at a glance, to re-establish emotional ‘contact’ with the mother.

The next great phase of development arrives when the child begins to speak. In the third year of life, with the acquisition of a basic vocabulary, verbal ‘contact’ is added to the visual. Now the child and its mother can express their ‘feelings’ towards one another in words.

As this phase progresses, the early, primary intimacies of direct body contact are inevitably restricted still further. It becomes babyish to be cuddled. The strongly growing need for exploration, independence and separate, individual identity increasingly dampens down the urge to be held and fondled. If parents over-express these primary body contacts at this stage, the child does not feel protected, but mauled. Being held now becomes being held back, and the parents have to adjust to the new situation.

For all this, body contact does not disappear completely. In times of pain, shock, fear or panic, the embrace will still be welcomed or sought, and even at less dramatic moments some contact will still occur. There are considerable changes, however, in the form which it takes. The all-embracing hugs shrink to small fragments of their former selves. The semi-embrace, the arm around the shoulder, the pat on the head and the hand-clasp begin to appear.

The irony of this phase of later childhood is that, with all the stresses that exploration brings, there is still a great inner need for the comfort of bodily contact and intimacy. This need is not so much reduced as suppressed. Tactile intimacy spells infancy and has to be relegated to the past, but the environment still demands it. The conflict that results from this situation is resolved by the introduction of new forms of contact that provide the required bodily intimacy without giving the impression of being babyish.

The first sign of these disguised intimacies appears early and takes us almost back to the baby stage. It starts in the second half of the first year of life and has to do with the use of what have been called ‘transitional objects’. These are, in effect, inanimate mother-substitutes. There are three common ones: a favourite sucking-bottle, a soft toy and a piece of soft material, usually a shawl or a particular piece of bedding. In the early baby phase they were experienced by the infant as part of the intimate contacts it had with its mother. They were not preferred to the mother then, of course, but were nevertheless strongly associated with her bodily presence. In her absence they become substitutes for her, and many children will refuse to go to sleep without their comforting proximity. The shawl or the soft toy has to be in the cot at bedtime, or there is trouble. And the demands are quite specific – it has to be the toy or the shawl. Similar but unfamiliar ones will not do.

At this stage the objects are employed only when the mother herself is not available, which is why they become so important at bedtime, when contact with the mother is being broken. But then, as the child grows, a change takes place. Now, as the infant becomes more independent of the mother, the favourite objects become more, rather than less, important as comforters. Some mothers misinterpret this and imagine that the infant is feeling unnaturally insecure for some reason. If the child becomes desperate for contact with its ‘Teddy’, or ‘shawly’ or ‘cuddly’ – these objects always seem to acquire a special nickname – the mother may look upon it as a backward step. In fact, it is just the reverse. What the child is doing, in effect, is saying, ‘I want body contact with my mother, but that would be too babyish. I am too independent for that now. Instead I will make contact with this object, which will make me feel secure without throwing me back into my mother’s arms.’ As one authority has put it, the transitional object ‘is reminiscent of the pleasurable aspects of mother, is a substitute for mother, but is also a defense against re-envelopment by mother’.

As the infant grows older and the years pass, the comforter may persist with remarkable tenacity, surviving in some cases even into middle childhood. In rare cases it may last into adulthood. We are all familiar with the nubile girl sprawled on her bed clutching her giant Teddy bear. I say ‘rare cases’, but that requires qualification. It is certainly rare for us to retain an obsession for precisely the same transitional object that we employed in infancy. For most of us the nature of the act would become too transparent. Instead, we find substitutes for the substitutes – sophisticated adult substitutes for the childish mother-body substitutes. When the baby-shawl becomes transformed into a fur coat we treat it with more respect.

Another form of disguised intimacy in the growing child is found embedded in the development of rough-and-tumble play. If it is babyish to embrace and cuddle but the need is still there, then the problem can be solved by embracing the parent in such a way that the body contact involved does not look like an embrace. The loving hug becomes a mock-aggressive bear-hug. The embrace becomes a wrestling-match. In play-fighting with the parent, the child can once again relive the close intimacy of babyhood whilst hiding behind the mask of aggressive adulthood.

This device is so successful that mock body-fighting with the parent can be seen even in later adolescence. Still later, between adults, it is usually restricted to a friendly punch on the arm or thump on the back. Admittedly, the play-fighting of childhood involves more than merely disguised intimacy. There is a great deal of body-testing as well as body-touching, of exploring new physical possibilities as well as reliving old ones. But the old ones are certainly there and they are important – much more so than is usually recognized.

With the arrival of puberty, a new problem asserts itself. Bodily contact with the parent is now further curtailed. Fathers find that their daughters suddenly become less playful. Sons become body-shy with their mothers. In the post-baby phase, the need for independent action began to express itself, but now, at puberty, the need intensifies and introduces a powerful new demand: privacy.

If the baby’s message was ‘hold me tight’, and the child’s was ‘put me down’, that of the adolescent is ‘leave me alone’. One psychoanalyst has described the way in which, at puberty, ‘The young person tends to isolate himself; from this time on, he will live with the members of his family as though with strangers.’ This statement makes its point, of course, by over-emphasis. Adolescents do not go around kissing strangers, but they do continue to kiss their parents. True, the actions have now become more formalized – the smacking kiss has become a peck on the cheek – but brief intimacies do still take place. As with adults, however, they are at this stage largely limited to greetings, farewells, celebrations and disasters. In fact, the adolescent is already adult – sometimes super-adult – as far as his or her family intimacies are concerned. With unconscious ingenuity, loving parents overcome this problem in a variety of ways. A typical example is the ‘clothing-adjustment’ pattern. If they cannot perform a direct loving touch, they can nevertheless make body contact by disguising it as ‘let me straighten your tie’ or ‘let me brush your coat’. If the reply is ‘stop fussing, mother’ or ‘I can do it myself’, then this means that the adolescent has, equally unconsciously, seen through the trick.

When post-adolescence arrives and the young adult moves outside the family, then – from the point of view of body intimacy – it is as if a second birth has been experienced, the womb of the family being abandoned as was the womb of the mother two decades before. The primary sequence of changing intimacies – ‘hold me tight/put me down/leave me alone’ – now goes back to the beginning again. The young lovers, like the baby, say ‘hold me tight’. Occasionally they will even call one another ‘baby’ as they say it. For the first time since babyhood, intimacies are once again extensive. As before, the body-contact signals begin to weave their magic and a powerful bond of attachment starts to form. To emphasize the strength of this attachment, the message ‘hold me tight’ becomes amplified by the words ‘and never let me go’. Once the pair-formation is completed, however, and the lovers have set themselves up as a new two-piece family unit, the second babyhood phase is over. The new intimacy sequence moves relentlessly on, copying the first, primary one. The second babyhood gives way to the second childhood. (This is the true second childhood, and is not to be confused with the senility phase, which appears much later and has sometimes been mistakenly referred to as the second childhood.)

Now the enveloping intimacies of courtship begin to weaken. In extreme cases, one or both members of the new pair start to feel trapped, their independence of action threatened. It is normal enough, but it feels unnatural and so they decide it was all a mistake and split up. The ‘put me down’ of the second childhood is replaced by the ‘leave me alone’ of the second puberty, and the primary family separation of adolescence becomes the secondary family separation of divorce. But if divorce creates a second adolescence, then what is this neo-adolescent doing alone, without a lover? So, after the divorce, each of the ex-pair members finds a new lover, goes through the second babyhood stage once more, remarries and, with a crash, is back at the second childhood. To their astonishment, the process has repeated itself.

This description may be a cynical over-simplification, but it helps to make the point. For the lucky ones, and even today there are many of them, the second adolescence never comes. They accept the conversion of the second babyhood into the second childhood. Augmented with the new intimacies of sex and the shared intimacies of parenthood, the pair-bond survives.

In later life the loss of the parental factor is softened by the arrival of new intimacies with the grandchildren, until eventually the third and final babyhood appears on the scene with the approach of senility and the helplessness of old age. This third run-through of the intimacy sequence is short-lived. There is no third childhood, at least in earthly terms. We end as babies, snugly tucked in our coffins, which are softly padded and draped – just like the cradles of our first babyhood. From the rock of the cradle we have passed on to the rock of ages.

For many, it is difficult to contemplate the third great intimacy-sequence ending there. They refuse to accept that the third babyhood does not continue into a third childhood, to be found in heaven. There the condition is ideal and permanent, and there is no fear of being over-mothered, for God the Father has no wife.

In tracing these patterns of intimacy from the womb to the tomb, I have dwelt at greater length on the early phases of life, passing more swiftly over the later stages of adulthood. With the roots of intimacy exposed in this way, we can now look more closely at adult behaviour in the chapters that follow.
