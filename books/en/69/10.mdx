It is impossible to list all the many works that have been of assistance in writing Intimate Behaviour. I have therefore included only those which either have been important in providing information on a specific point, or are of particular interest for further reading. They are arranged below on a chapter-by-chapter and topic-by-topic basis. From the names and the dates given, it is possible to trace the full references in the bibliography that follows. The bibliography also contains the titles of several broader works, not listed below against specific topics, which have proved of value in relation to the general subject.

Most of the statements concerning body contacts are, however, based on my own personal observations. Where specific statements are made, such as that a particular action is, say, three times as common in females as in males, they are based on a sample of 10,000 randomly selected units of behaviour. An archive of human contact actions, based on this study, was compiled and used as the basis for future publications, such as Manwatching and Bodywatching.

Acknowledgments


Although in the past no books have been devoted specifically to the subject of Intimate Behaviour, I have been greatly helped by a large number of papers and volumes on associated topics and on special aspects of the problem. These I gratefully acknowledge, and details concerning them can be found in the bibliography here. As I have been writing for a general audience, I have not included specific references to these works in the text, but a chapter-by-chapter guide is given here.

In addition, I would like to express my debt to my scientific colleagues and, above all, to my personal intimates, from whom I have learned so much. In particular, I would like to thank my wife Ramona, my publisher Tom Maschler and my assistant Trisha Pike. Without their help these pages could not have been written.
