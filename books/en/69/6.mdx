title: 6 Substitutes for Intimacy
---




IN THE ADULT human world, a world full of stress and strangers, we reach out to our loved ones for comfort. If, through their indifference or through their preoccupation with the complexities of modern living, they fail to respond, we are in danger of becoming starved of the primary reassurance of bodily contact. If, through the moralizing of a warped minority, they have become inhibited in their intimacies and have been driven to accept the view that indulgence in the tactile pleasures of the body is somehow sinful and wicked, then, even in the midst of our nearest and dearest, we are liable to become touch-hungry and body-lonely. We are, however, an ingenious species, and if we are denied something we badly want or need, our resourcefulness soon urges us on to find a substitute to replace it.

If we cannot find love inside the family, we soon start looking for it outside. The ignored wife takes a lover; the husband, a mistress. Body intimacies reblossom. Unhappily, these particular substitutes do not always add to the surviving intimacies of family life; they compete with them, and perhaps eventually replace them altogether, causing varying degrees of social havoc as they do so. A less damaging alternative was the one discussed in the last chapter – the use of contacts with specialists who are licensed to touch. These have the great advantage that they do not usually compete with the relationships inside the family unit. The extensive intimacies of the masseur, providing they are applied with a strict professionalism, cannot be cited as grounds for divorce. But even a professional toucher, no matter how valid his official excuse for touching may be, is still a physiologically functional adult being, and as such is inevitably seen as a potential sexual threat. The ‘seeing’ of this threat is seldom spoken of openly, except occasionally in jest. Instead, society quietly imposes more and more restrictions on the nature and context of the specialist intimacies. To begin with, they are rarely admitted to exist. One goes dancing, not to touch, but ‘for fun’. One goes to the doctor because of a virus, not because one needs comfort. One goes to a hairdresser to have the hair styled, not to have the head caressed. These official functions are, of course, all perfectly valid and important. They have to be so in order to mask the fact that something else is going on at the same time, namely the seeking of friendly body contact. The moment they cease to be important, this unfulfilled need becomes too obvious, and some basic questions about our way of life start demanding answers we would rather not be forced to consider.

Unconsciously, however, we are all aware of the game that is being played, and so, indirectly, we tie the hands that we would have caress us. We do this by applying conventions and codes of conduct that reduce our sexual fears. Usually we do not say why. We simply accept the abstract rules of good etiquette, and tell one another that certain things are ‘not done’ or ‘not nice’. It is rude to point, leave alone touch. It is impolite to show one’s feelings.

So where do we turn? The answer is as soft and cuddly as the kitten in your lap. We turn, in fact, to other species. If those humans closest to us cannot supply us with what we want, and if it is too dangerous to seek intimacies with strangers, then we can make tracks to the nearest pet shop and, for a small sum, buy ourselves a piece of animal intimacy. For pets are innocent; they cause no questions and they ask no questions. They lick our hands, they rub softly up against our legs, they curl up to sleep on our thighs, and they nuzzle us. We can cuddle them, stroke them, pat them, carry them like babies, tickle them behind the ears, and even kiss them.

If this seems trivial, consider the scale of the operation. In the United States, more than 5,000 million dollars is spent on pets every year. In Britain the annual figure is 100 million pounds. In West Germany it is 600 million Deutsche marks. In France, a few years ago it was 125 million new francs, and estimates already indicate that this figure has by now doubled. Trivial is not the word for figures such as these.

The most important pets are cats and dogs. In the United States there are 90 million of them. Puppies and kittens are born there at the rate of 10,000 every hour. There are over 16 million dogs in France, eight million in West Germany and five million in Britain. Precise information on cats is not available, but there are certainly as many cats as dogs and probably more.

Putting these figures together, one can say that, at a rough guess, there are approximately 150 million cats and dogs in these four countries alone. Making another rough guess, let us say that each owner of one of these animals stroke, pats or caresses it, on the average, three times a day – or about 1,000 times a year. This adds up to a total of 150,000 million intimate body contacts per year. What is astonishing about this figure is that it represents for Americans, Frenchmen, Germans and Englishmen intimacies performed not with other Americans, Frenchmen, Germans or Englishmen, but with alien species belonging to the order Carnivora. Viewed in this way, the phenomenon looks even less trivial.

As we have already seen, we pat one another on the back when we embrace, and we stroke one another’s hair and skin when we are lovers, or parents with children. But clearly we do not get enough, and those thousands of millions of animal caresses are there to prove it. Blocked in our human contacts by our cultural restrictions, we redirect our intimacies towards our adoring pets, our substitutes for love.

This situation has led to violent criticism from some quarters. Dubbed ‘petishism’ by one author, it has been condemned as reflecting a decadent failure of modern, civilized human beings to communicate intimately with one another. In particular it has been stressed that more money is usually forthcoming to support the prevention of cruelty to animals than to prevent cruelty to children. The answers given in support of modern pet-keeping are rejected as illogical and hypocritical. The argument that it teaches us the ways of animal life is considered nonsensical, in view of the gross anthropomorphism of the relationship in almost every case. The pets are humanized – they are seen as furry people, not real animals at all. The argument that animals are innocent and helpless and need our aid is seen as hopelessly one-sided in an era of battered babies and napalmed peasants. How is it that, in this enlightened age, we can have permitted a million children to be killed or wounded in Vietnam, while our cats and dogs have been provided with expert and immediate attention whenever they have needed it? How is it that in the twentieth century we can have licensed our adult males to murder 100 million members of their own species in warfare, while we have spent more millions on stuffing food into our luxuriating pet animals? How is it, to sum up, that we have come to be kinder to other species than to our own?

These are strong arguments and they cannot be dismissed lightly, but they contain a vital flaw. The answer, put very simply, is the old one that two wrongs do not make a right. Undeniably, it is monstrous to cuddle a pet and ignore a child, and it is true that in extreme cases this does happen. But to use this as an argument for not cuddling a pet is a folly. It is doubtful if, even in extreme cases, the pet ‘steals’ the caress from the child. If, for some neurotic reason, the child is not receiving love from the parent, it is doubtful whether the absence of a cuddle-some pet would help to improve the situation. In almost every case, a pet animal is being used either as an additional source of intimacy, or as a substitute for intimacies that are already lacking for some reason. To say that more caring for animals is actively causing less caring for other humans seems to be totally unjustified.

Imagine for a moment that a freak disease exterminated all pet animals tomorrow, and effectively eliminated all those millions of tender intimacies that would have occurred between them and their owners. Where would all that loving go? Would it magically be re-redirected, back on to other human companions? The answer, sadly, is that it would probably not. All that would happen is that millions of people, some of them lonely and incapable for a variety of reasons of enjoying any real human intimacies, would be robbed of a major form of tender body contact. The old lady who lived alone with her cats would hardly start stroking the postman. The man who fondly patted his dog would be unlikely to pat his teenage son more in its absence.

It is true that in an ideal society we should not need these substitutes or additional outlets for our intimacies, but to suggest banning them because of this is to attempt to cure the symptom and not the cause of the trouble. And even in the ideally loving and body-free society, we would probably always have plenty of intimacy to spare for our animal companions, not because we would then need such contacts, but simply because they would give us additional pleasures that would in no way compete with our human relationships.

A final word in defence of pets: if we are capable of tenderness towards animals it does at least reveal that we are capable of such tenderness. But, the answer comes back, even the commandants of concentration camps were kind to their dogs, so what does that prove? It proves, in short, that even the most monstrous of human beings is capable of some kind of tenderness, and the fact that its juxtaposition to callous brutality in this particular case offends us so deeply, and makes the brutality even more horrific, must not blind us to this fact. It serves as a constant reminder that the human animal, when not warped by what must paradoxically be called the savageries of civilization, is fundamentally endowed with a great potential for tenderness and intimacy. If witnessing the gentle, friendly touching that occurs between pet-owners and their pets does no more than bring home to us that man is basically a loving, intimate animal, then this alone is a valuable lesson to learn and relearn, all the more so in a world that grows yearly more impersonal and cold-hearted. When, under pressure, men become merciless, it is then that we need all the evidence we can muster to prove that this need not be so – that this is not the natural condition of man. If our capacity to love our pet animals serves to demonstrate one facet of this, then well-meaning critics must think twice about launching an attack on it, no matter how unreasonable it may seem when viewed from certain angles.

This said, what of the nature of the animal intimacies themselves? Why, for example, do we pat a dog and stroke a cat, but rarely stroke a dog or pat a cat? Why does one kind of animal draw forth one type of intimacy and another another? To answer this we have to look at the anatomy of the animals concerned. In their roles as pets they are, of course, acting as stand-ins for human companions, and their bodies are therefore substitutes for human bodies. Anatomically, however, there are striking disparities. The stiff legs of a dog cannot embrace us. We cannot fling our arms around a cat. Even the largest cat is no bigger than a human baby, and its body is soft and pliable. We therefore adjust our actions accordingly.

First, the dog. As our loving companion, we want to embrace him, but because his legs make this difficult, we isolate the patting element from the embrace-and-pat complex and apply it direct. Reaching out, we pat the animal’s back, or perhaps its head or flanks. In a typical large dog, the back is broad and firm and a suitable substitute for the human back which we are patting by proxy.

The cat is a different matter. Being smaller and softer to the touch, it does not feel right as a back-substitute to be vigorously patted. Its soft, silky fur is more like human head-hair to the touch. We tend to stroke a loved one’s hair, and so it follows that we tend to stroke a cat. As the dog was a back-substitute, so the cat is a hair-substitute. In fact, we often treat a cat as though its whole body is a stand-in for a silky-haired human head.

Extending this argument, it might be thought that patting is something we automatically do to all canines, and that stroking is an action for all felines, but it is not as simple as this. It has much more to do with the typical body quality of the domestic dog and the domestic cat. Anyone who has enjoyed the exotic luxuries of body intimacies with a tame cheetah, lion or tiger will know that there the pattern changes. Although they are true felines, they have broad, firm backs more reminiscent of the domestic dog than of the family cat. Like the typical dog, the hair is also coarser. The result is that they are patted, not stroked. By contrast, a tiny lap-dog with long flowing hair is stroked and caressed more like a cat.

Moving up the scale in size, the horse-lover is also a patter, but there is a subtle change. The original human back – where the patting began, so to speak – was a vertical surface, but the back of a horse is horizontal and therefore less satisfying as a site for the substitute action. The horse’s neck, however, comes to the rescue, being both the right height and, what is more, providing the ideal vertical surface, and it is here that the majority of horse-pattings are delivered. In this respect, the horse goes one better than the dog, whose neck is generally too small to be of much use in this respect. Again, the horse’s height makes it ideal for head contacts which, in the dog, force us to lower ourselves to his level, or raise him up in our arms. And so many a horse-lover can be seen with her head pressed to her animal’s neck or face, while her arm embraces and her hand pats the firm, warm flesh.

For many people a pet is not merely a substitute companion, but more specifically a substitute for a child. Here the size of the animal becomes important. Domestic cats are no problem, but the typical dog is too large, and so certain types have been progressively reduced in size by selective breeding until they have been successfully scaled down to human baby proportions. Then they, like cats and various other creatures such as rabbits and monkeys, can be scooped up in their owner’s pseudo-parental arms without undue exertion. This is by far the most popular form of body contact to occur, where pet animals are concerned. An analysis of a large number of photographs depicting owners in contact with their pets reveals that the act of holding the animal in the arms, as if it were an infant, accounts for 50 per cent of all cases. Patting is the next most common action (11 per cent), followed by the semi-embrace, in which one arm is wrapped around the animal (7 per cent), followed closely by the pressing of the cheek to the pet’s body, usually in the region of its head. Another intimacy that appears with rather surprising frequency is the mouth-to-mouth kiss (5 per cent), the species involved ranging from the budgerigar to the whale. The whale, one might think, leaves something to be desired as an animal intimate. Captain Ahab would certainly have been startled at the idea of a girl kissing one on the mouth, but the recent trend in oceanarium displays has changed all that. Both tame whales and their smaller relatives, the dolphins, have become front-line favourites in recent years, and since their bulbous, swollen foreheads give a baby-like shape to their heads, they create a strong urge in their human companions to pat, tickle and caress them when they protrude their apparently grinning faces from the sides of their pools.

Birds that are hand-tame, such as parrots, budgerigars and doves, are frequently brought up to the face and held against the cheek, where the soft smoothness of their plumage can be felt against the skin. The intimacy is often elaborated with mouth-to-mouth feeding of morsels of food. Because of their small size, which rules out embracing and patting, the hand intimacies are limited to finger-stroking and gentle tickling ‘behind the ear’.

If we move further away on the evolutionary scale, the possibilities for intimacies decline rapidly. For most people, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects are singularly unrewarding to the touch. The tortoise, with its smooth, hard shell, rates an occasional pat on the back, but its scalier relatives lack the essential qualities for friendly body contact. Perhaps the only exceptions worth mentioning are the giant constricting snakes. When suitably tamed, pythons, for example, can provide their owners with something that even the cats and dogs cannot offer – an all-enveloping embrace. Wrapping their strong coils around their human companions’ bodies, tightening and relaxing their muscles, undulating their many ribs, and flickering their gentle tongues across their owners’ skins, they create a sensuous impact that has to be felt to be believed. However, because of their difficult feeding habits and the bad press they have received ever since the fracas in Eden, not to mention our horror of their smaller and highly poisonous relatives, the big snakes have never enjoyed wide popularity as close intimates, even for the most embrace-hungry of humans.

Fish-touching, if we draw a discreet veil over the treacherous human intimacy of trout-tickling, is virtually non-existent. Perhaps the only exception here is the voluptuous hand-kissing sometimes performed by tame giant carp when sticking their gaping heads out of water as they beg for food. These fish can gape and gulp with such energy at the edge of a carp pond that even a passing bird may be coerced into a brief act of intimacy. There is an extraordinary photograph in existence which shows a small finch, its beak full of luscious insects for its hungry nestlings, pausing in front of the inviting gape of a tame carp’s mouth and impulsively ramming its precious catch down the wide open throat of the fish. If a bird can be attracted in this way to make a thoroughly unnatural body contact, then it is little wonder that human visitors to carp-ponds react in much the same way.

Up to this point we have considered only friendly and parental intimacies, but for some humans the contacts go further and include full sexual interaction. These cases are rare, but they have a long and ancient history, references to them being scattered throughout art and literature from the earliest times. They take two main forms. Either a human male copulates with an animal, usually a domesticated farm animal, or masturbation occurs. In the latter case, a natural tendency on the part of a particular species to lick or suck is directed towards the human genitals, either male or female, as a device for producing sexual arousal. It says a lot for the degree of alienation and body-contact frustration that must exist in human societies that such aberrant intimacies occur at all. However, when we remember the millions of lesser intimacies, in the form of cuddlings, kissings and strokings, that take place in our modern cultures between pet-owners and their vast army of pets, it is not so surprising that, in a small minority of cases, greater intimacies such as these do occasionally arise.

In surveying the whole question of human-animal contacts, mention has so far been made only of pets and farm animals, but there are two other spheres of interaction that deserve some comment. Human-controlled animals exist not only in private homes and on farms; they are also found in large numbers in zoos and research laboratories. Here, too, frequent contacts occur and they are not always ones that meet with general approval.

Visitors to zoos not only want to see the captive creatures held there; they also want to hold the captive creatures seen there. The urge to touch is so strong that it constitutes a constant hazard for the zoo authorities. The first-aid department register of any major zoological gardens bears witness to this. For every sprained ankle or cut finger, there is a bitten hand or a scratched face. Sometimes the injuries sustained by the eager animal-gropers are serious, but they are seldom caused by carelessness on the part of the zoo staff. Two examples will suffice to illustrate this. The first concerns a woman who arrived at the first-aid department of a major zoo, holding her screaming child, who had a badly mauled hand. While it was being treated, it emerged that he had begged to be allowed to touch the body of the zoo’s adult male gorilla. Complying with his wish, the woman had lifted him laboriously over the safety barrier, past the large warning sign indicating that the animal was extremely dangerous, and had thrust him forwards so that he could push his arms around the edge of the protective armoured glass screen and through the bars into the cage. The gorilla, misinterpreting this friendly act, had promptly sunk its teeth into the boy’s hand. Unrepentant, the woman now presented herself, outraged, to the helpless zoo authorities.

The second case concerns the tragic affair of the ‘tiger-toucher’, an elderly gentleman who repeatedly clambered over the barrier at the same zoo’s big cat house in order to caress one particular tigress. Removed, protesting, time and again by the zoo staff, he finally leapt over the barrier in such desperation that he broke a leg and was removed to a hospital bed. During his absence the tigress in question was dispatched to another zoo for breeding purposes. On his return to health, the man went straight back to the cage, only to find it occupied by a strange leopard. Furious at this, he marched across to the zoo office and demanded to know what they had done with his wife. At first the authorities were nonplussed by this extraordinary accusation, but after quiet questioning it emerged that the unhappy man had recently lost his real wife, after a lifetime of close companionship, and had since transferred all his emotional attachments to the tigress in question. Because the animal had, in his mind, become the embodiment of his late mate, it was only natural that he should want to continue to make intimate contact with her body in its new form, even at considerable risk to life and limb.

If these examples seem outlandish, it is worth remembering that they are only extremes of actions which, at a more moderate level, are occurring in zoos throughout the world in large numbers every day. When the urge to touch another human being is blocked, either by personal tragedy or by cultural taboo, it will nearly always find a way of expressing itself, no matter what the consequences. One is inescapably reminded here of the pathetic cases of child-molesters who are arrested for supposedly sexual assaults on infants. Unable to make proper contact with adults, they turn to children, who are innocent of the strictness of adult taboos. Frequently all that such men want is some kind of gentle, friendly body intimacy, but always the cry for blood goes up and the actions are interpreted as inevitably sexually motivated. This they may of course be, but it is by no means inevitable, and many a harmless old man has suffered heavily as a result. Needless to say, the children in such cases always suffer too, not from the original intimacies, which even in the specifically sexual cases they probably did not understand, but from the parental panic that follows and, above all, from the trauma of the court proceedings through which they are shamefully dragged.

Returning to the animal situation and leaving the zoo gates behind us, we come now to the fourth major category of man-animal contacts, namely those that exist in the world of science. Millions of laboratory animals are bred and killed annually in the course of medical research, and the contacts that occur between research workers and their experimental subjects have given rise to much heated debate. To the scientist, the interaction is a totally objective one. He admits to no emotional bond, either positive or negative, either loving or hating, with the animals he must handle while carrying out his investigations. The decision is simple enough: if he can reduce human suffering by sacrificing the lives of laboratory animals, he sees no other choice. He would avoid it if he could, but he cannot, and he refuses to place the lives of animals on a higher plane than the lives of fellow humans. That, briefly, is his case, but it is frequently and vociferously contested.

The opponents have been many, and their general attitude can best be summed up in the words of George Bernard Shaw, who said that ‘If you cannot attain knowledge without torturing a dog, you must do without knowledge.’ A more moderate view is expressed by those who feel that many animal experiments are pointless and that the results they obtain are worthless in any humanitarian sense, doing no more than satisfy the idle curiosity of the academic world. Surprisingly enough, such a view was voiced by the great Charles Darwin himself, in a letter to another famous zoologist, in which he said, ‘Physiological experiment on animals is justifiable for real investigation, but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity.’ More recently, it has been pointed out by a respected experimental psychologist that ‘One consequence of the obsessively behaviouristic and mechanistic approach is the apparent callousness of much of the experimental work carried out on the lower animals, often without any worthwhile aim.’

It is certainly true that the number of licensed animal experiments performed each year has risen sharply as the twentieth century has grown older. In Britain the figure for 1910 was 95,000; by 1945 it had exceeded 1,000,000; more recently, in 1969, it was in the region of 5,500,000, involving 600 separate research establishments. The vast scale of the operation has started to cause comment in political circles. One member of the British Parliament, speaking in 1971, protested: ‘I know that the object is to preserve human life; but it does make me wonder whether a human race that can take such morally degrading practices in its stride is really worth preserving.’

It is important to separate two distinct elements in these and other criticisms of the large-scale use of animals for research. First, there is the extreme, anthropomorphic element, which sees the animals as symbolic people and therefore dislikes the idea of causing them pain for whatever purpose. Second, there is the humanitarian element, which sees animals as similar to people, in that they are capable in their own ways of feeling fear, pain and distress, and dislikes the idea that they should be caused any unnecessary suffering at human hands. This second element accepts, however, that it is necessary to cause some degree of suffering, but only if it is kept to an absolute minimum and only if the research is directly aimed at reducing a greater suffering.

The research scientist responds to these two criticisms in the following way. To the first critic he says, ‘Tell that to the mother of a thalidomide baby.’ If more extensive animal experimentation had been carried out, she might have had a normal child. Or he may say, ‘Tell that to the mother whose child died of diphtheria.’ Only a few years ago this disease killed thousands of children annually, but now, thanks to the development of a vaccine developed entirely by experiments on living animals, it has practically disappeared. Or he may say, ‘Ask the mother of a polio child how she feels about the fact that it costs the life of an experimental monkey for every three doses of the polio vaccine that could have saved her child.’

In other words, what the out-and-out anti-vivisectionist is proclaiming is that it is better for a child to die or suffer agonies than for living animals to be used for experimental research. Whilst this may reflect an admirable concern for the welfare of animals, it also reveals a startlingly callous attitude towards human children. This putting of animals before people takes us back again to the pet-keeping situation, but here there is an important difference. Where pets were concerned, it was perfectly possible to be kind both to pets and to people. One did not automatically exclude the other, and the anti-pet argument to the contrary was shown to be false. But here the situation does demand that in order to be kind to the child it is unhappily necessary to be unkind to the experimental animal. We simply cannot have it both ways. An unpleasant choice has to be made.

To the second and more moderate critic, the research scientist says, ‘I agree; animal suffering must be kept to a minimum, but there are problems.’ A great deal of detailed study has been made in recent years of ways in which experimental procedures can be made less painful for the animal subjects, and everything is done to devise tests which use fewer animals, which cause them the minimum of distress and, where possible, replace them altogether. On this basis we might expect to see the number of laboratory animals killed annually declining steadily. As the figures I quoted show, however, this is not the case. The research scientist’s answer is that this does not mean that more wasteful methods are being used, but rather that research programmes are becoming increasingly extensive and investigating more and more ways of alleviating human suffering. Furthermore, he will point out that one of the great problems with research is that it is impossible to limit it to areas which are directly and obviously connected with specific forms of suffering. Many of the greatest and ultimately most beneficial discoveries are made as a result of animal experiments in ‘pure’ rather than ‘applied’ research. To say that an animal experiment must not be done because, at the moment, it has no obvious application in such spheres as medicine or psychiatry is to stifle the whole progress of scientific understanding.

This is the point at which some of the least emotional and most educated critics begin to get worried. How far, to use Darwin’s words, does ‘real investigation’ have to go before it becomes ‘mere damnable and detestable curiosity’? This involves a much more difficult and delicate argument. Reading some of the scientific journals, especially those concerned with experimental psychology, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that many research workers in recent times have, by any reasonable standards, gone too far. By so doing they are endangering the public acceptance of scientific endeavour as a whole, and many authorities believe that it is high time that a drastic revision was made of the direction that many research projects are taking. If this is not done there may be a large-scale public backlash that will, in the long run, do untold harm to scientific progress.

Having made these general points, it now remains to ask why the man/animal contacts that occur in the laboratory should cause so much heated debate and concern. The obvious – too obvious – answer is that, even when we accept that it is justified and necessary, we do not like the idea of a man causing pain to the animal he handles. But what about the man who finds mice in his kitchen, or the slum-dweller who finds rats in his bedroom, and beats them to death with a stick or condemns them to a slow and painful death by putting down poison? He does not receive our criticism, only our sympathy. There are no protection societies formed to protect the wild rats and mice that infest our dwelling-places, and yet these are the same species that are used in the laboratory experiments which cause so much comment. Killing a wild rat is approved of because it may spread disease, but killing a laboratory rat is disapproved of, even though its death may also help to prevent the spread of disease, via the agency of scientific discovery.

How can we explain this inconsistency? Clearly it has little to do – whatever we may say – with our objective concern for the welfare of rats, wild or tame. If we really cared about the laboratory rat for its own sake, as an exciting form of animal life, we would not treat its wild counterpart so brutally. No, what is happening is that we are responding in a much more complex and subtle way than we imagine. We respond to the wild rat in a very basic way as an invader of our private territory, and we feel justified in defending that territory with any means at our disposal. No treatment is too harsh for a dangerous intruder. But what of the tame white rat in the laboratory? Is this not the creature whose ancestors brought the great plague into our midst? Certainly it is, but now it appears in a new role, and we must understand what that role is if we are to understand the strong emotions its experimental death causes in us.

To start with, the white rat is no longer a pest, but a servant of man. He is gently handled, well fed, well housed and cared for in every possible way. The attitude of his human companion is that of a doctor tending a patient before an operation. Then he is experimentally infected with cancer. Later he is killed by the same hands that cared for him. Except for the cancer element, this sequence could also apply to the relationship between a farmer and his domestic stock. He cares for them, then kills them. Yet we do not complain about the behaviour of the average farmer towards his animals, any more than we complain about the man who poisons a wild rat in his kitchen. Where does this leave us? The laboratory sequence involves tender handling, then causing pain, then killing. The farm sequence involves tender handling, then killing. The pest sequence involves causing pain and killing. In other words, we do not object to killing after caring, or to killing after causing pain, but we do object to causing pain after caring. The symbolic role that the white rat plays in the research laboratory is that of the humble and faithful servant who is loved by his master until, one day, without warning or provocation, this loving master starts to torture his servant and does so, not for the servant’s own good, but for the benefit of the master himself. This is the allegory of betrayal that causes all the trouble.

The critics of animal experiments will hotly deny this, claiming that it is the rat they are thinking about and not this symbolic relationship, but unless they are full-time vegetarians who literally would not swat a fly, they are deluding themselves. If ever they have received any kind of medical aid, they are hypocrites. If, however, they are honest, they will admit that it is the betrayal of intimacy inherent in the symbolic man-rat relationship that really concerns them.

Now it should become clear why I have gone at some length into a pattern of human behaviour that, at first sight, does not appear to have any close connection with the subject of this book. The whole essence of the experimentalist’s dilemma is that, to allay fears, he must emphasize over and over again how well he treats his laboratory animals: how gently he handles them, how relaxed and contented they are in their hygienic cages where they await the important part they have to play in his research. It is the contrast between this tender intimacy and what he then proceeds to do to them that is the crux of the passionate antagonism he arouses in his critics. For, as we have seen throughout this book, intimacy means trust, and the symbolic rat-servant is made to trust his master totally, only then to be subjected to pain and disease at his gentle, caring hands. If this betrayal of intimacy occurs only occasionally and for very special reasons, then most of the critics can reluctantly accept it, but when it takes place millions of times every year, then they begin to get the creepy feeling that they belong to a nation of emotional traitors. If a man can inflict deliberate pain on an animal that trusted him and which, a moment before, he was handling so gently and carefully, then how can he be trusted in his human relationships? How, when in all other respects of his social life he behaves in a perfectly reasonable and friendly way, can we ever be sure again that reasonable friendliness is any true guide to the nature of the members of the society in which we live? How can he behave so well towards his real children, when he constantly double-crosses his symbolic laboratory ‘children’? These are the fears that run unspoken through the minds of his critics.

There is a similarity here to the case mentioned earlier of the concentration camp commandant who was kind and gentle to his pet dogs, whilst brutally torturing his prisoners. There, the kindness to his animals reminded us that even such a monstrous human being was not totally devoid of tender feelings. Here, the position is reversed, with a man who is capable of being kind to his fellow men nevertheless being able to spend his working days inflicting pain on his experimental animals. It is the contrast that frightens us. If we see a friendly-looking soldier patting his dog on the head, we cannot help wondering whether he, too, would be capable of gassing helpless human victims. If we see a friendly-looking father playing lovingly with his children, we cannot help wondering whether, beneath the surface, he is capable of cruel experiments. We begin to lose our sense of values. Our faith in the bonding power of body intimacies begins to waver, and we rebel against what we call the callousness of science.

We know perfectly well that this rebellion is unjustified because of the immense benefits that scientific research has brought us, but it hits so hard at our basic concepts of what gentle, caring intimacy means that we cannot help it. We still rush to the pharmacy when we get sick and quickly swallow our pills and tablets, but we try not to think of the trusting, betrayed animals who suffered to give us these antibiotic blessings.

If the situation is bad for the general public, what must it be like for the experimentalist? The answer is that it is not bad at all, for the simple reason that he has trained himself specifically not to see his relationship with his animals as a symbolic one. In applying a ruthlessly objective approach to his subject, he overcomes the emotional difficulty. If he handles his animals with gentle care, he does it to make them better subjects for experimental procedure, not to satisfy his emotional needs for substitute body intimacy like the ardent pet-keeper. This often requires considerable restraint and self-discipline, because, of course, even the most intellectually controlled act of body contact can begin to work its basic magic and start to form bonds of attachment. It is not unknown for a large laboratory to house, in a corner cage, a fat, lop-eared rabbit that has become the departmental mascot, a pampered pet that no one would dream of using for an experiment, because it has slipped into a totally different role.

For the non-scientist it is difficult to make these rigid distinctions. For him, all animals belong in Disneyland. If, through the modern educational media of film and television, he broadens his horizons and begins at last to forget the toy-animal images of his childhood, he does so not at the deft hands of experimentalists, but in the company of naturalists, whose basic approach is that of the observer, rather than the manipulator, of animal life.

The plight of the serious experimentalist therefore remains unsolved. Like the surgeon who operates to save his patients’ lives, he strives to improve our lot, but unlike the surgeon he gets little thanks for it. Like the surgeon, he remains strictly objective and unemotional throughout his operations. In either case, emotional involvement would be damaging. For the surgeon this is less obvious, for he must put on a bedside manner outside the operating theatre. Once inside, however, he treats the bodies of his patients as coldly and objectively as the experimentalist, carving them up like a master chef performing with a choice joint of meat. If this were not so, we would all suffer for it in the long run. If the experimentalist became emotionally involved with his animals and treated them all like beloved pets, he would soon be incapable of carrying on his arduous research projects that bring us so much widespread relief from disease and agony. He would be driven to drink by the enormity of what he was doing. Likewise, if the surgeon allowed himself to become emotionally aroused by the plight of his patients, his knife might waver as it sliced, and vital damage would be done. If hospital patients could hear the conversations that take place in many operating theatres, they would probably be horrified by the sometimes jocular, sometimes matter-of-fact tones, but their response would be misguided. The terrible intimacy of entering another person’s body with a sharp instrument demands a dramatic switching-off of the emotional impact of the act. If the action is performed as a piece of desperate, loving care, then the patient’s next piece of body intimacy is liable to be at the cold hands of an undertaker.

In this chapter we have been looking at the use of living substitutes for human bodies in a contact-hungry world. Where the contacts have been loving, as with cuddly pets, the intimacies involved have caused considerable pleasure; where they have been strictly non-loving, as with experimental animals, they have caused considerable displeasure. In sum total they account for a vast number of tactile interactions, and animals are clearly of great importance to us in this respect. We have been considering mostly cases of adult human activity; but pet-keeping is also a significant pattern for the older child, when it starts to imitate its parents by showing intense pseudo-parental care for small animals, cuddling them, carrying them, nursing them and caring for them as if they were totally dependent infants. Since cats and dogs are often already stamped as the pseudo-infants of the real parents in the family group, the young pseudo-parents frequently become more devoted to other species of a type that adults normally scorn, such as rabbits, guinea-pigs and tortoises. These species, being uncontaminated by parental involvements, then provide a separate and more private world for the substitute intimacies of the juvenile pseudo-parents.

For younger children the problem is solved by the use of toy animals – substitutes for the substitutes for love. These are cared for and loved exactly as though they were living beings, and the attachment to a favourite Mickey Mouse or Teddy bear is as passionate and powerful as that of any older child to a favourite rabbit or, later, to an adored pony. For many girls the attachment to a large cuddly toy animal survives right into adulthood, and a newspaper photograph of recent hijack victims shows a teenage girl returning to safety ‘still clutching the Teddy bear that comforted her through her ordeal in the desert’. When we are badly in need of some kind of reassuring body contact, even an inanimate object will do, and this is the subject of the next chapter.
