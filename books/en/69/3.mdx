title: 3 Sexual Intimacy
---




IN DISCOVERING HIS personal identity, the growing child must reject the soft embrace of his mother’s arms. At last, as a young adult, he stands alone. As a baby, his trust in his mother was unlimited, his intimacy total. Now, in maturity, both his relationships with other adults and his intimacies with them are severely limited. Like them, he keeps his distance. Blind trust is replaced by alert manoeuvring, dependency by interdependency. The gentle intimacies of infancy that gave way to the joyful games of childhood have become the tough social transactions of adulthood.

There is no denying the excitement. There are things to explore, goals to achieve and status to be raised. But where did all the loving go? Loving was an act of giving, giving oneself without question to another person, but adult relationships are not like that …

Up to this point my words could apply as much to a growing monkey as to a growing human. The pattern is the same. But now comes a difference. If the monkey is a male, it will never again, as an adult, know the total intimacy of a loving bond. Until the day it dies, it will continue to exist in the loveless world of rivalries and partnerships, of competition and co-operation. If it is a female, it will eventually regain the loving condition, as a mother with an infant of its own, but like the male it will know no such bond with another adult monkey. Close friendships, yes; partnerships, yes; brief sexual encounters, yes; but total intimacy, no.

For the adult human, however, there is such a possibility. He is capable of forming a powerful and lasting bond of attachment for a member of the opposite sex that is much more than a mere partnership. To say that ‘marriage is a partnership’, as is so often done, is to insult it, and to completely misunderstand the true nature of a bond of love. A mother and her baby are not ‘partners’. The baby does not trust the mother because she feeds and protects him; he loves her because she is who she is, not because of what she does. In a partnership one merely exchanges favours; the partner does not give for the sake of giving. But between a pair of adult human lovers there develops a relationship like that between mother and child. A total trust develops and, with it, a total bodily intimacy. There is no ‘give and take’ in true loving, only giving. The fact that it is ‘two-way giving’ obscures this, but the ‘two-way receiving’ that inevitably results from it is not a condition of the giving, as it is in a partnership; it is simply a pleasing adjunct to it.

For the cautious, calculating adult, the entry into such a relationship appears a hazardous affair. The resistance to ‘letting go’ and trusting is enormous. It breaks all the rules of bargaining and dealing that he is so used to in all his other adult relationships. Without some help from the lower centres of his brain, his higher centres would never permit it. But in our species that help is forthcoming and, often against all reason, we fall in love. For some, the natural process is suppressed, and if they do enter into a state of marriage or its equivalent, they do so as if it were a business transaction: you rear child, I earn money. This ‘baby-buying’, or ‘status-buying’, has sadly become commonplace in our crowded human zoos, but it is fraught with dangers. The mated pair are held together, not by internal bonds of attachment, but by the external pressures of social convention. This means that the couple’s natural potential for falling in love still lies waiting inside their brains and can leap into action without warning at any time, to create a true bond somewhere outside their official one.

For the lucky ones this sequence does not take place. As young adults, they find themselves falling in love uncontrollably and forming a true bond of attachment. The process is a gradual one, although it does not always appear to be. ‘Love at first sight’ is a popular concept. It is, however, usually a retrospective judgment. What occurs is not ‘total trust at first sight’, but ‘powerful attraction at first sight’. The progress from first attraction to final trust is nearly always a long and complex sequence of gradually increasing intimacies, and it is this sequence that we must now examine.

To do so, the simplest method is to take a pair of ‘typical lovers’, as seen in our Western culture, and follow them through the process of pair-formation from first glimpse to ultimate copulation. In doing this we must always remember that there is in reality no such thing as the ‘typical lover’, any more than there is the ‘average citizen’ or ‘man in the street’. But it helps if we start out by trying to imagine one, and then, afterwards, consider the variations.

All animal courtship patterns are organized in a typical sequence, and the course taken by a human love affair is no exception. For convenience we can divide the human sequence up into twelve stages, and see what happens as each threshold is successfully passed. The twelve (obviously over-simplified) stages are these.

1. Eye to body. The most common form of social ‘contact’ is to look at people from a distance. In a fraction of a second it is possible to sum up the physical qualities of another adult, labelling them and grading them mentally in the process. The eyes feed the brain with immediate information concerning the sex, size, shape, age, colouring, status and mood of the other person. Simultaneously a grading takes place on a scale from extreme attractiveness to extreme repulsiveness. If the signs indicate that the individual in view is an attractive member of the opposite sex, then we are ready to move on to the next phase in the sequence.

2. Eye to eye. While we view others, they view us. From time to time this means that our eyes meet, and when this happens the usual reaction is to look away quickly and break the eye ‘contact’. This will not happen, of course, if we have recognized one another as previous acquaintances. In such cases, the moment of recognition leads instantly to mutual greeting signals, such as sudden smiling, raising of the eyebrows, changes in body posture, movements of the arms and eventually vocalizations. If, on the other hand, we have locked eyes with a stranger, then the rapid looking away is the typical reaction, as if to avoid the temporary invasion of privacy. If one of the two strangers does continue to stare after eye contact has been made, the other may become acutely embarrassed and even angry. If it is possible to move away to avoid the staring eyes, this will soon be done, even though there was no element of aggression in the facial expressions or gestures accompanying the stare. This is because to perform prolonged staring is in itself an act of aggression between unfamiliar adults. The result is that two strangers normally watch one another in turn, rather than simultaneously. If, then, one finds the other attractive, he or she may add a slight smile to the next meeting of glances. If the response is returned, so is the smile, and further, more intimate contact may ensue. If the response is not returned, a blank look in reply to a friendly smile will usually stop any further development.

3. Voice to voice. Assuming there is no third party to make introductions, the next stage involves vocal contact between the male and female strangers. Invariably the initial comments will concern trivia. It is rare at this stage to make any direct reference to the true mood of the speakers. This small-talk permits the reception of a further set of signals, this time to the ear instead of the eye. Dialect, tone of voice, accent, mode of verbal thinking and use of vocabulary permit a whole new range of units of information to be fed into the brain. Maintaining this communication at the level of irrelevant small-talk enables either side to retreat from further involvement, should the new signals prove unattractive despite the promise of the earlier, visual signals.

4. Hand to hand. The previous three stages can all occur in seconds, or they may take months, with one potential partner silently admiring the other from a distance, not daring to make vocal contact. This new stage, the hand to hand, may also take place quickly, in the form of the introduction handshake, or it is likely to be delayed for some considerable time. If the formalized, non-sexual handshake does not come into operation, then the first actual body contact to occur is likely to be disguised as an act of ‘supporting aid’, ‘body protection’ or ‘directional guidance’. This is usually performed by the male towards the female and consists of holding her arm or hand to help her cross a street, or climb over an obstruction. If she is about to walk into an obstacle or danger spot, then the hand of the male can quickly take the opportunity to reach out swiftly and take her arm to alter her course or check her movement. If she slips or trips, a supporting action with the hands may also facilitate the first body contact. Again, the use of acts which are irrelevant to the true mood of the encounter is important. If the body of the girl has been touched by the man in the act of assisting her in some way, either partner can still withdraw from further involvement without loss of face. The girl can thank the man for his help and leave him, without being forced into a position where she has to deliver a direct rebuff. Both parties may be well aware that a behaviour sequence is just beginning, and that it is one that may lead eventually to greater intimacies, but neither as yet does anything which openly states this fact, so that there is still time for one to back out without hurting the other’s feelings. Only when the growing relationship has been openly declared will the action of. hand-holding or arm-holding become prolonged in duration. It then ceases to be a ‘supportive’ or ‘guiding’ act and becomes an undisguised intimacy.

5. Arm to shoulder. Up to this point the bodies have not come into close contact. When they do so, another important threshold has been passed. Whether sitting, standing or walking, physical contact down the side of the body indicates a great advance in the relationship from its earlier hesitant touchings. The earliest method employed is the shoulder embrace, usually with the man’s arm placed around the girl’s shoulders to draw the two partners together. This is the simplest introduction to trunk contact because it is already used in other contexts between mere friends as an act of non-sexual companionship. It is therefore the smallest next step to take, and the least likely to meet rebuff. Walking together in this posture can be given the air of slight ambiguity, half way between close friendship and love.

6. Arm to waist. A slight advance on the last stage occurs with the wrapping of the arm around the waist. This is something the man will not have done to other men, no matter how friendly, so that it becomes more of a direct statement of amorous intimacy. Furthermore, his hand will now be in much closer proximity to the genital region of the female.

7. Mouth to mouth. Kissing on the mouth, combined with the full frontal embrace, is a major step forward. For the first time there is a strong chance of physiological arousal, if the action is prolonged or repeated. The female may experience genital secretions and the male’s penis may start to become erect.

8. Hand to head. As an extension of the last stage, the hands begin to caress the partner’s head. Fingers stroke the face, neck and hair. Hands clasp the nape and the side of the head.

9. Hand to body. In the post-kissing phase, the hands begin to explore the partner’s body, squeezing, fondling and stroking. The major advance here is the manipulation by the male of the female’s breasts. Further physiological arousal occurs with these acts and reaches such a pitch that, for many young females, this is a point at which a temporary halt is called. Further developments mean increasing difficulty in breaking off the pattern without continuing to completion, and if the bond of attachment has not reached a sufficient level of mutual trust, more advanced sexual intimacies are postponed.

10. Mouth to breast. Here the threshold is passed in which the interactions become strictly private. For most couples this will also have applied to the last stage, especially where breast manipulations are concerned, but advanced kissing and body-fondling does occur frequently in public places under certain circumstances. Such actions may cause reactions of disapproval in other members of the public, but it is rare in most countries for serious steps to be taken against the embracing couple. With the advance to breast-kissing, however, the situation is entirely different, if only because it involves the exposure of the female breast. Mouth-to-breast contacts are the last of the pre-genital intimacies and are the prelude to actions which are concerned not merely with arousal, but with arousal to climax.

11. Hand to genitals. If the manual exploration of the partner’s body continues, it inevitably arrives at the genital region. After tentative caressing of the partner’s genitals, the actions soon develop into gentle, rhythmic rubbing that simulates the rhythm of pelvic thrusting. The male repeatedly strokes the labia or clitoris of the female and may insert his finger or fingers into the vagina, imitating the action of the penis. Manual stimulation of this kind can soon lead to orgasm for either sex, and is a common form of culmination in advanced pre-copulatory encounters between lovers.

12. Genitals to genitals. Finally, the stage of full copulation is reached and, if the female is a virgin, the first irreversible act of the entire sequence occurs with the rupture of the hymen. There is also, for the first time, the possibility of another irreversible act, namely that of fertilization. This irreversibility puts this concluding act in the sequence on to an entirely new plane. Each stage will have served to tighten the bond of attachment a little more, but, in a biological sense, this final copulatory action is clearly related to a phase where the earlier intimacies will already have done their job of cementing the bond, so that the pair will want to stay together after the sex drive has been reduced by the consummation of orgasm. If this bonding has failed, the female is liable to find herself pregnant in the absence of a stable family unit.

These then are twelve typical stages in the pair-formation process of a young male and female. To some extent they are, of course, culturally determined, but to a much greater extent they are determined by the anatomy and sexual physiology common to all members of our species. The variations imposed by cultural traditions and conventions, and by the personal peculiarities of certain unusual individuals, will alter this major sequence in a number of ways, and these can now be considered against the background of the typical sequence through which we have just passed.

The variations take three main forms: a reduction of the sequence, an alteration in the order of the acts and an elaboration of the pattern.

The most extreme form of reduction is forcible mating, or rape. Here the first stage runs as quickly as is physically possible to the last stage, with all the intervening phases condensed to the absolute minimum. After eye-to-body contact has been made by the male, he simply attacks the female, omitting all arousal stages, and goes as rapidly to genital-to-genital contact as her resistance will allow. The non-genital body contacts are limited purely to those necessary to overpower her and strip her genital region of clothing.

Viewed objectively, rape in the human species lacks two important ingredients: pair-formation and sexual arousal. The rapist male, by omitting all the intermediate stages of the sexual sequence, clearly does not allow a bond of attachment to grow between himself and the female in question. This is obvious enough, but it is relevant in biological terms, because our species does require this personal attachment to develop, as a means of safeguarding the successful rearing of the offspring that may result from the copulation. There are other species, with little or no parental responsibilities, where, in theory, rape would create no problems. That it is rare is due, amongst other things, to the physical difficulty of achieving the goal of rape. A man without a pair of grasping hands and verbalized threats would find it virtually impossible, and this is a dual advantage which other species lack. Even where animal rape does seem to occur, appearances can be deceptive. For example, carnivores can, and most carnivore species do, grab their females by the scruff of the neck with their jaws during the act of mating, as if to prevent their mates from escaping, but there is still the problem of successfully inserting the penis into the vagina of a writhing female form. If the female is unresponsive, the male stands little chance. The truth is that the superficially savage act of neck-gripping in male carnivores is a rather specialized movement. Although it looks like the act of a rapist male, it is in fact the carnivore equivalent of a gentle parental embrace in our own species. The bite is strongly inhibited, so that the teeth do not harm the female. This is the pattern of behaviour a parent carnivore employs towards its young when carrying them from place to place. The male is, in effect, treating the female like a cub or a kitten, and if she is sexually responsive to him, she reacts like one, going limp in his jaws as she once did when being protectively transported by her mother in early life.

For the human male animal, rape is comparatively easy. If physical force is not enough, he can add threats of death or injury. Alternatively he can contrive to render the female unconscious or semi-unconscious, or can enlist the aid of other males to hold her still. If the absence of the female’s sexual arousal makes penis insertion difficult or painful, he can always resort to the use of some alternative form of lubrication to replace the missing natural secretions.

For the female in question these proceedings are, to say the least, both unsatisfying and unsatisfactory, and, to say the most, may result in severe trauma and psychological damage. Only in cases of rape where the partners are already known to one another and where the female has a strong masochistic streak is there any chance at all of an emotional attachment developing as a result of this violent reduction of the normal sexual sequence of our species.

I have gone into this question of rape at some length because it bears a close relationship to another form of sexual reduction which is much more widespread and important in our culture. To contrast it with the violent rape we have been discussing, we might call it ‘economic rape’. Unlike the violent kind, it occurs, not in derelict building-sites or damp hedgerows, but in decorously draped boudoirs and cosy bedrooms. It is the loveless mating act of the marriage of economic convenience, the act of couples who marry and copulate with only the barest hint of a true bond of attachment.

In past centuries, the parentally controlled status marriage was commonplace. Today it is becoming increasingly rare, but the psychological scar it left on the children it spawned is more lasting. As growing, developing witnesses to this loveless relationship, the offspring of the match were themselves in danger of becoming sexually crippled, so that they were incapable of expressing the full amatory sequence typical of our species. Their sexual anatomy was in perfect working order; their physiological arousal mechanisms were operating efficiently; but their ability to relate these biological features to a deep and lasting bond of attachment will have been stunted by the atmosphere in which they matured. They, in turn, will find it difficult to make successful pair-bonds, but social pressures will encourage them to try, and once again the next generation of children will suffer. Such a reverberation is difficult to eliminate, and the untold damage caused by past cultural interferences with the natural human process of falling deeply in love is still with us today, even though the parentally controlled marriage is fading into history.

The pattern of ‘economic rape’ is not, of course, as extreme as that of violent rape, in the way in which it condenses the full twelve-stage sequence. Superficially it may appear very similar to the full pattern, with the partners ‘going through the motions’ of the different stages, one by one, until copulation is reached. But if we examine the actions in detail we find that they are all reduced in intensity, duration and frequency.

Take first the classic case of the young couple who are pushed together to satisfy the economic or status relationship of their two families. In earlier centuries, their pre-marital courtship might typically involve no more than a few abbreviated embraces and kisses, following prolonged verbal exchanges. Then, with little knowledge of one another’s bodies or sexual emotions, they are thrust together into a marriage bed. The bride is advised that nasty but necessary things will have to be done to her by her bridegroom in order to ensure the future population of the nation, and that while this is going on, she is to ‘lie still and think of England’. The male is given rudimentary instruction concerning female anatomy and told to be gentle with his bride because she will bleed when he penetrates her. With this information the young couple perform their sexual duties as simply and quickly as possible, with a minimum of pleasure and a minimum of pair-bonding. For the female, there is rarely if ever an orgasm. For the male, there is an unresponsive object in his bed, which happens to be his wife, but which sexually is little more than an object, the vagina of which he uses like a hand to masturbate his penis. In their public, social lives the young couple will, naturally, be provided with a set of rules enabling them to simulate a loving relationship. Each of the public intimacies, severely restricted in the form it can take, is precisely described and defined by the books of polite etiquette, so that it will become almost impossible to tell the true loving couple from the false. Almost, but not quite, and for the children it will be painfully easy, for they have not yet had their heads crammed with detailed rules of conduct, and they will intuitively detect the degree of lovingness or lovelessness in their parents’ relationship. And so the damage will go on.

If this description seems bizarre today, in the latter half of the twentieth century, then this is not because such marriages no longer occur, but rather because they are less blatantly organized than they once were. A much greater show of loving is put on nowadays to mask such relationships, but a show it remains nevertheless. Parents are less involved than they were, which also disguises the pattern. Now it is one or both members of the pair who set out themselves to construct an economically based marriage. Behind her wedding veil the bride’s lips are moving, but she is not overcome with emotion; she is busy calculating her alimony rating. The man at her side with a faraway expression on his face is not lost in a romantic dream, he is working out the impact his socially efficient bride will have on his business colleagues. Admittedly, the brides no longer lie still and think of wherever-it-is on their wedding nights. Instead, they check their orgasm frequencies against the national average for their age group, educational level, and racial and urban background. If they fall below the required level, they employ a firm of private investigators to find out where the husband is relocating the additional 1.7 orgasms per week that they should be getting. Meanwhile the husbands are trying to estimate how many early evening drinks they can consume before running the risk of alcoholically impairing their ability to achieve an insertable erection later that night. All too often it is these that are the sweet mysteries of life in modern urbania.

In looking at reductions in the sexual sequence, we have progressed from rape, to the parentally controlled marriage of the past, to the so-called ‘bitch/bastard’ marriage of modern times. The obsession with orgasm frequency in the last of these is an important new development that appears to lead us away from the reduction and compression of the full sexual sequence that we were discussing. Indeed, it looks like a swing in the other direction, towards elaboration rather than reduction. But the matter is not quite so simple. Basically, what has happened in the new ‘sexual freedom’ is that the later stages have been given much greater emphasis. The elaboration of the sequence has all been concentrated at one end of it – the copulatory end. The earlier courtship patterns, so important for pair-formation, instead of being elaborated, have been reduced and simplified. It is worth trying to discover the way this has come about.

In earlier centuries, the courtship stages were prolonged in time, but severely restricted in intensity. Insistence on obeying formal-rules of procedure, down to the last detail, reduced their emotional impact. Then, after marriage, the later pre-copulatory and copulatory patterns were strongly curtailed by ignorance and anti-erotic propaganda. The males solved this problem with brothels and mistresses. The females, by and large, did not solve it. In the first half of the present century the situation changed. Parental control was loosened and serious attempts were made at sexual education, with the publication of books on ‘married love’. The result was that young couples were much freer to search for a partner that suited them and to indulge in less formalized courtship activities. The phenomenon of the chaperone vanished. The rules of conduct for body contact were relaxed, so that virtually all stages of the sexual intimacy sequence were permitted, excluding only the final, genital ones. These pre-marital activities were, however, still expected to cover a considerable period of time. Eventually, when marriage did take place, the couple were able to take to their mating bed with a much greater knowledge of one another’s bodies and emotional personalities. Efficient contraception had appeared on the scene, combining with the new sexual knowledge to make marital pleasures less restricted and more satisfying.

During this phase there was a tendency for young couples, before marriage, to indulge in prolonged ‘petting sessions’. The idea that they were now allowed to go so far, but no further, seemed good in theory, but was difficult in practice. The reason is obvious enough. Unlike the young couples of earlier days, they were now permitted to go past the first stages of courtship – the ones which helped to form a bond of attachment, but which did not produce strong physiological arousal of the sex organs – and on into the stages which were really concerned with pre-copulatory stimulation. The half-way mark between the two is the act of the mouth-to-mouth kiss. Simply performed this is a pleasant bonding act, but energetically repeated it is also the starting point of pre-copulatory arousal.

This led to a new type of crisis for the young lovers. Prolonged petting resulted in prolonged erections for the males and prolonged sexual secretions for the females. One of three things then happened: they broke off the sequence in accordance with ‘official ruling’ and remained intensely frustrated, or they continued by non-copulatory means to achieve mutual orgasm, or they broke the rules and copulated. If they used the second method and masturbated or fondled one another to orgasm, and if they continued to do this over a long pre-marital period, there was always the danger that this pattern of climax would begin to assume too great a significance in their sexual relationship, making for difficulties when, eventually, they were able to complete the act of copulation after marriage. If they chose the third alternative and broke the rules, there was the problem of guilt and secrecy. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, the prolonged pre-marital phase was strongly conducive to the formation of a powerful bond of attachment, so that it had a great deal to commend it over the previous situation, when the couple were severely restricted in their actions.

Moving on now to more recent times, a new change has occurred. Although official attitudes may still be the same, they are less strictly enforced. With further improvements in contraception, virginity has lost its significance for many young girls. The non-copulation rule that was once reluctantly broken is now commonly ignored. Virginity, far from being prized, has almost become a stigma, an indication of some kind of sexual inadequacy. Pre-marital copulation is an accepted pattern by the young lovers, if not by their parents. The result of this development, which is more widespread than some people like to admit, is that the lovers no longer experience the intense ‘petting frustrations’ of their predecessors, nor are they in danger of becoming fixated on masturbatory activities. Instead, their courtship grows naturally, and without undue postponement, into the full twelve-stage sexual sequence.

Assuming the existence of adequate venereal hygiene and efficient, readily available contraception, what, if any, is the danger of this new situation? The answer, as some have seen it, is the ‘tyranny of the orgasm’, the need created by the social pressures of the new permissive convention to achieve maximum copulatory performance. This is seen as a threat to the person who truly falls in love, but who is incapable of sufficiently impressive orgasmic achievements.

There is something curiously short-sighted about this criticism. Earlier I did mention the obsession with orgasm frequency, but that was in connection with the loveless marriage, the modern equivalent of the economic or status marriage. There, as I pointed out, the female may feel she has failed if her sexual athleticism is below standard, because she is concerned, even in matters of sex, with the business of status. But if two young people are in love today, they will laugh at the desperate athleticism of the copulating non-lovers. For them, as for true lovers at all points in history, a fleeting touch on the cheek from the one they adore will be worth more than six hours in thirty-seven positions with someone they do not. This has always been so, but for these new lovers there is the added advantage that, circumstances permitting, they are no longer restricted to a mere cheek touch. They can do anything they wish with one another’s bodies, as much or as little as they wish. If the powerful bond of attachment has formed, then it will be the quality of the sexual behaviour that counts, not its mere quantity. For them, the new conventions simply permit, they do not insist, as some critics seem to think.

Another point which the critics seem to miss is that when a couple have started to fall in love, they will not want to omit the earlier stages of the sexual sequence. They will not give up holding hands merely because they are permitted to copulate. Furthermore, they are not the ones who will be likely to have much trouble in quite naturally enjoying maximum orgasmic pleasure when they reach the final stages of the sequence. The emotional intensity of their personal relationship will ensure this, and they will happily reach climax after climax without having to resort to the contorted wrestlers’ postures of the ubiquitous modern sex manuals.

Perhaps the greatest danger that the permissive young lovers face today is an economic one, for they still inhabit a complex, economically structured society, and it was no accident that economics came to figure so largely in the marriages of yesterday. Previously this aspect was safeguarded by all the rigid restrictions placed on early sexual behaviour. Sexual intimacy suffered, but social status was ensured and organized. Now the social status of the young pair has become a problem, as sexual intimacy blossoms. How can a pair of seventeen-year-old lovers, who are fully sexually mature, who have developed a powerful bond of attachment, and who are enjoying a full sexual life, set up home in our modern economy? Either they have to wait in a kind of social limbo, or they have to ‘drop out’ of the accepted social pattern. The choice is not an easy one, and the problem has yet to be solved.

We arrived at this discussion by considering the ways in which the sexual sequence becomes reduced from its full expression. We must now leave the young lovers, fully expressing it, but enduring considerable social problems in so doing, and return to the reductions once more. What of the sexually active non-lover? We have dealt with the rapist and the sexually inhibited marriage partners who reduced their copulatory stages to a child-spawning minimum, but what about the loveless sexual athletes of today? How do they reduce the sexual sequence of the typical lovers? For them, the later genital stages are not expressed as the culmination of a pattern, but as a replacement for it. In earlier times this was precisely what occurred when a man visited a prostitute. There was no holding of hands, no cuddling or murmuring of sweet nothings, merely a quick business transaction and then straight to direct genital contact. What we might call ‘commercial rape’. In previous generations this was often a young man’s first introduction to copulation, but today such professional services are hardly necessary. Instead they are replaced by what is referred to as ‘sleeping around’. In such cases there is frequently a massive reduction in the early stages of the sequence, just as there was with the visit to the prostitute. The situation is summed up by the girl in the cartoon who says ‘Boys simply don’t want to kiss any more’, as she returns late at night to her room in an obvious post-copulatory condition, exhausted and with her clothes dishevelled, but with her make-up still neatly intact.

The result of this type of reduction is to provide the maximum of copulatory activity with the minimum of pair-bond development. As a status device this may permit repeated ego-boosting, but as a source of intense pleasure it degrades sexual activity to the level of something like urinating. It is not surprising, therefore, that for the ‘permissive’, non-loving copulator some elaboration of the consummatory act becomes desirable. If it has lost its emotional intensity along with its powerful bond of personal attachment, then it must be given some increased physical intensity as a compensation. This is where the illustrated sexual manuals come on the scene, and it is worth analysing some of them to see what they recommend.

A sample taken at random from the large number now on sale included a combined total of several hundred photographs, each showing a young naked couple in the act of ‘making love’. Of these illustrations, no more than 4 per cent showed any of the first eight stages in my twelve-stage sequence described earlier. By contrast, 82 per cent showed full copulation, each book including between thirty and fifty posture variations. This means that the vast majority of all the various sexual intimacies were illustrated as the final stage of genital/genital contact, and clearly demonstrates the great emphasis placed on this concluding element of the sequence. Whereas previous censorship limited the illustration of amorous activities to the earlier stages, the removal of this censorship, instead of enriching the situation, has simply had the effect of shifting concentration from one end of the scale to the other. The implied message is that the act of copulation should be made as complex and varied as possible, and forget about the rest. Many of the postures shown are obviously uncomfortable, if not actually painful to maintain for any length of time, except possibly for trained circus acrobats. Their inclusion can only reflect a desperate search for copulatory novelty as a means to obtaining further arousal. The emphasis is no longer on loving, but on sexual athletics.

There is, of course, nothing harmful about these patterns as amusing and playful additions to sexual behaviour, but if obsession with them replaces and excludes the personal emotional aspects of the interaction between the male and female involved, then their ultimate effect is to decrease the true value of the relationship. They may elaborate one element of the sexual sequence, but overall they reduce it.

Young lovers who need these copulation variations, rather than merely play with them in an exploratory fashion from time to time, are perhaps not young lovers at all. At a later point, when they have passed right through the intense pair-formation stage of their lives, and have arrived at the more mellow pair-maintenance phase, they may well find that some embellishments and novel additions to their sexual activities will provide a valuable way to re-heighten intensity, but if as young lovers they are truly in love it is surprising if this will be necessary.

Needless to say, this does not mean that any of these sexual intimacies, no matter how contrived or unusual, should be condemned or suppressed. Providing they are performed voluntarily in private by adults and cause no physical harm, there is no biological reason why they should be outlawed or attacked by society. In certain countries this is still, however, the case. One example concerns oral/genital contacts, which I omitted from my earlier twelve-stage list. The reason why they were not included is because they do not represent a clear-cut stage in the progress from first encounter between the lovers to final copulation. In the vast majority of cases they appear only after the first copulations have occurred, as a further embellishment of the genital intimacies. Later, when copulation has become a regular feature of a relationship, they are frequently included as a standard pre-copulatory pattern, and evidence from ancient art and history indicates that they have long been so employed.

Modern American surveys indicate that today oral/genital contacts are used by about half of all married couples as part of their pre-copulatory activities. The application of the male mouth to the female genitals was recorded in 54 per cent of cases, that of female mouth to male genitals in 49 per cent. Although this is well below the figures for the other pre-copulatory patterns in my twelve-stage list (mouth to mouth, hand to breast, mouth to breast, and hand to genitals all occur in over 90 per cent of cases), an average of roughly 50 per cent of the population for mouth-to-genital contact can hardly justify calling this activity ‘abnormal’. Yet despite this, and despite the fact that it occurs widely in other mammalian species, it is often regarded as an ‘unnatural’ intimacy. It is condemned by the Judaeo-Christian religious codes, even between married partners, and in many places it is not only considered immoral but is also illegal. It is surprising to find that, right into the second half of the twentieth century, this has been the case in almost all the states in the United States of America. To be more specific, in only Kentucky and South Carolina can an American married couple privately engage in any kind of oral/genital contact without breaking the law. This means that in recent times 50 per cent of all other Americans have, technically speaking, been sexual law-breakers at some time in their married lives. In the states where it is outlawed, the act is rated as a felony everywhere except in New York, where it is classified as a mere ‘misdemeanor’. In the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Mississippi and Ohio, the law has applied a curious kind of sexual inequality, the act being legal when the husband makes oral contact with his wife’s genitals, but a felony when she performs a similar intimacy with him.

These strange legal restrictions have seldom been applied in practice and have been rendered nonsensical in recent years, during which open sale and advertisement of flavoured vaginal douches has been permitted in America, but they do appear from time to time in divorce cases, where oral/genital acts have been cited as factors contributing to ‘mental cruelty’ in marriage. It has also been pointed out that, in theory, these laws could lead to instances of blackmail. Biologically, as I have already pointed out, there is no case against mouth-to-genital contacts. On the contrary, if they heighten the emotional intensity of pre-copulatory activities, they will merely serve to tighten the bonds of attachment between the mated pair and thereby strengthen the married condition which is so vigorously protected in so many other ways by the Church and the laws of the land.

If we examine the exact form which this type of intimacy takes in the human species, it is possible to detect a difference between man and the other mammals that employ mouth-to-genital contacts. Usually, in other species, the action begins as sniffing and nuzzling and then extends into licking. Rhythmic friction is less common. The significance of the act lies in the acquisition of detailed information concerning the state of the partner’s genitals. Unlike man, other mammalian species only come into full sexual condition at certain times of the year, or at certain restricted phases of the menstrual cycle, and it is important for the partner, especially the male, to know as much as possible about the precise state of arousal before attempting copulation. The application of the nose and tongue to the genital region provides valuable clues concerning odour, taste and texture. The actual stimulation of the partner by these contacts is probably of secondary importance.

In man, the situation is reversed, the stimulation element becoming more important. The mouth is employed to arouse the partner rather than to learn about his or her sexual condition. It is for this reason that, in man, rhythmic friction takes on a more important role than mere touching or licking, the female using her mouth as a pseudo-vagina and simulating the actions of pelvic thrusting by movements of her neck. The male may also use his tongue as a pseudo-penis, but he is more likely to employ clitoral stimulation, using rhythmic tongue pressure. Again, he will imitate the repeated massage of the female organ that occurs during the pelvic thrusting of copulation itself. The great advantage to the male of this form of mimic-copulation is that he can provide prolonged stimulation for the female without himself becoming orgasmically satiated. In this way he can compensate for the longer time the average female takes to reach the orgasmic level.

This last fact no doubt explains why the extensive use of this type of sexual intimacy is more common amongst males than females. A contrast, however, has been found in the portrayal of these acts in ‘blue movies’. A recent study of the history of films of this type made over the past half-century reveals that here the female action is portrayed much more frequently than the male. There is a special reason for this. These films have traditionally been made for use at all-male gatherings, or ‘stag-parties’, and are often referred to as ‘stag movies’. Such occasions have little to do with love, being concerned instead with sex as a status device. If male status is involved, the historians of blue movies have pointed out that it ‘belittles’ the man to show him in a subordinate posture to the female, but enhances his feelings of dominance to portray him in the superior role of being ‘served’ by the female. Here we are back to basic animal behaviour and the postures of inferior submissions. When kneeling and bowing are performed as submissive acts, their biological significance lies in the lowering of the inferior’s body in front of the superior. It is significant that the slang expression for oral/genital contact in man is ‘going down’ on the partner. In order to apply the mouth to the genitals, the active partner must considerably lower his or her body in relation to that of the passive one. This applies in any position, but is particularly clear when the act is performed with the passive partner standing. The active male or female must then kneel or crouch in front of the standing body to apply the mouth to the genital region, thus entailing the adoption of an almost medieval posture of servility. It is little wonder, then, that the performance of this act by the female to the male appeals so strongly to the status sex gatherings of males at stag-parties. Between lovers in private, of course, the situation is entirely different. Unless the encounter is one of loveless sexual gratification, the act will be one of giving pleasure and not of status-boosting, and will show no such bias. Because of the time-lag difference in reaching orgasm that exists between the sexes, it will then, as we have already seen, become more commonly extended as a male action rather than a female one.

In considering variations in the basic sexual sequence, we have so far been dealing with some of the ways in which it has been reduced and elaborated, but I also mentioned a third possibility, namely shifts in the order of appearance of the acts. Clearly these are many, and the fixed sequence I outlined is often altered in some way. As it stands, it is no more than a rough guide to the general trend which the various actions follow, from the moment of the first encounter to the final pattern of copulation. It remains a true picture of the average sequence of events, but the formalization of certain specific elements will have a marked effect on the order in which they follow one another in many cases. Some examples will clarify this.

The first three acts listed were: eye to body, eye to eye, and voice to voice. These pre-tactile ‘contacts’ rarely change position in the sequence. Today, exceptions can occur in instances where the initial encounter takes place over the telephone, and one sometimes hears someone say, ‘It’s pleasant to meet after having spoken on the phone so often.’ This implies that vocal exchanges on the telephone do not by themselves constitute a ‘meeting’. Combined with eye contact, however, they do. The phrase ‘we met last year’ need not signify any tactile contact, but merely a combination of visual and verbal exchanges. Nevertheless, a ‘meeting’ does usually include at least the minimal body contact of the handshake. To ‘meet someone’ it does seem important to have displayed some degree of physical touching. Since, in modern life, we encounter so many strangers, it is not surprising to find that this initial touching is rigidly stylized in form. A more variable type of body contact would involve too great an intimacy at such an early stage in the time-scale of the sequence of a developing relationship.

Because it has become so formalized, the handshake can frequently jump almost to the front of the whole sequence. A third party says simply, ‘Here is someone I want you to meet’; and, within seconds of making eye contact, skin contact has taken place, the two hands immediately stretching out and joining. The action may even occur slightly before verbal contact has been made.

This basic rule, that the more formalized a contact action becomes, the more it can jump forward in the sequence, is also particularly well illustrated by the mouth-to-mouth kiss. Although, strictly speaking, this is the first of the pre-copulatory arousal actions, and should belong to the second half of the sequence rather than the first, it often jumps forward in time by virtue of the accepted convention of the ‘goodnight kiss’ between young lovers. It is significant that the first kiss usually takes place as an act of farewell. The device employed here, which enables the kiss, combined with a full frontal embrace, to jump ahead of the less intimate semi-embraces of arm-around-shoulder and arm-around-waist, and possibly even hand-holding, is the way in which it borrows ‘innocence’ from the non-sexual kissing of family greetings and farewells. The young couple, having met and talked for some hours, may, at the moment of parting, go straight into a brief, formal embrace-and-kiss, even though they have not touched one another’s bodies previously in any way. This contrasts sharply with the situation where a man visits a prostitute, when the kiss may drop back in the sequence to a point where genital contact has already been made, or where kissing may even be totally omitted.

It will have become obvious that, in discussing these sexual variations, I have been thinking primarily of modern ‘civilized’ societies. In other cultures and tribes the patterns vary to a certain extent, but the general principles of a sequence of escalating intimacy still apply. An American survey of nearly two hundred different human cultures revealed that ‘unless social conditioning imposes inhibitions upon active foreplay it is very likely to occur’. Nearly all the arousal actions occur in most societies, but sometimes they take a slightly different form. The nose, for example, occasionally takes over from the mouth as a contact organ, nose-rubbing or -pressing replacing mouth-kissing. In certain tribes, mutual nose-and-face-pressing appears at the point where, more usually, mouth-to-face or mouth-to-mouth contacts would occur. In others, mouth-to-mouth and nose-to-nose contacts are performed simultaneously. Some males employ nose-rubbing rather than lip contact, to stimulate the female breasts. In other tribes, kissing takes the form of placing the lips close to the partner’s face and inhaling. In still others, it is more a question of reciprocal lip-and tongue-sucking. These variations of detail are interesting in their own right, but to over-emphasize their importance, as has sometimes been done in the past, is to obscure the fact that, in more general terms, there is a great similarity in the courtship and pre-copulatory patterns of all human beings.

Having looked at the sequence of human sexual intimacies, we now come to the question of their frequency. I have gone on record as saying that man is the sexiest of all the primates, a comment which has met with some criticism. The biological evidence, however, is irrefutable, and the argument that the high level of sexual activity observed in certain quarters today is the artificial product of civilized life is nonsensical. If anything, it is the remarkably low level of sexual activity in certain other quarters that can best be ascribed to the artificiality of modern living. As anyone who has been under severe stress will know, anxiety is a powerful anti-sexual influence, and, since there is a great deal of stress involved in the high-pressure existence of our modern urban communities, the fact that so much sexual behaviour still occurs is a remarkable testimony to the sexuality of our species.

Let me be more specific. If I put my statement in a slightly different way, namely that man is potentially the sexiest of all the primates, then there can be no argument. In the first place, other primates are limited in their sexual activities to a brief section of the female’s monthly sexual cycle. At these times her external sexual organs undergo a change that in most species is clearly visible to the male. This makes her sexually attractive to him. At other times she will have little or no appeal for him. In the human species the active phase is extended throughout almost the whole of the monthly cycle, more or less tripling the time when the female will be appealing to the male. Already, in this respect alone, the human animal has three times the sexual potential of his near relatives, the monkeys and apes.

Secondly, the female human remains both sexually appealing and responsive during most of her period of pregnancy, when other primates are not. Also, she becomes sexually active again much sooner after giving birth than do the other species. Finally, the average human animal of modern times can expect to enjoy roughly half a century of active sexual life, a range that few other mammals can match.

Not only is there this enormous potential for sexual activity, but in the vast majority of cases it is fully realized, so that I see no reason to modify my original statement. Most human beings express themselves sexually by finding partners and indulging in frequent sexual interactions, but even those who do not, or who are temporarily sexually isolated, do not normally become inactive. For them, it is typically the case that masturbation at fairly high frequency will be employed to compensate for the absence of a mate.

Above all, the human sexual pattern is complex. It involves not only vigorous copulation, but also all the gentle subtleties of courtship and the intense arousal actions of pre-copulatory behaviour. In other words, it not only occurs with high frequency over a long period of years, and with few interruptions from ‘dead periods’ in female reproductive cycles, but, when it does occur, it is prolonged and elaborate. This enlargement of the sexual life of the species is achieved by the addition to its primate inheritance of a great variety of sexual body contacts and intimacies, of the kind we have been discussing. Here the contrast with other species is striking and, to clarify this point, it is worth pausing to look at the way in which monkeys and apes perform sexually.

Monkeys do not form deep bonds of attachment to their mates and there is little courtship or pre-copulatory behaviour. During the few days of her monthly cycle when she is in full sexual condition, the female approaches the male or is approached by him, she turns her rump towards him, crouching down slightly with the front end of her body, he mounts her from behind, inserts his penis, makes a few quick pelvic thrusts, ejaculates, dismounts, and they move apart again. The whole encounter is usually over in a few seconds. A number of examples will give a clear idea of the widespread occurrence of this extreme brevity. In the bonnet monkey, the male makes only 5 to 30 pelvic thrusts. In the howler monkey, the figure is 8 to 28 thrusts, with an average of 17, taking 22 seconds, with a preceding 10 seconds for ‘body adjustment’. The rhesus monkey performs 2 to 8 pelvic thrusts, lasting a total of no more than 3 or 4 seconds. Baboons, in one report, made up to 15 pelvic thrusts, lasting for a total of 7–8 seconds; in another report, an average of 6 thrusts, lasting 8–20 seconds; in a third, 5 to 10 thrusts, lasting 10–15 seconds. Two reports for chimpanzees give the average male performance as 4 to 8 thrusts, with a maximum of 15 in one instance, and 6 to 20 thrusts in a total copulating time of 7–10 seconds in another.

These details plainly indicate that our hairier relatives do not linger at the business of mating. To be fair, however, they do perform these ‘instant copulations’ with a very high frequency during the short period of days while the female is in sexual condition. In some species, remounting occurs within a few minutes, and may be repeated a number of times in quick succession. In the South African baboon, for instance, there are usually from 3 to 6 mountings one after the other, with only two-minute intervals between them. In the rhesus monkey this figure rises, and there may be from 5 to 25 mountings with intervals of only a minute or so between each. It seems as if the male only ejaculates after the final mounting, which is more vigorous and intense, so that here the pattern does appear to be more complex. In all these cases, however, the mating activity differs markedly from that of the human animal.

In the human species, not only is there more sexual foreplay, but the act of copulation itself takes longer. In the pre-copulatory phase, over 50 per cent of human couples spend longer than ten minutes indulging in a wide variety of arousal techniques. After this, pelvic thrusting for the male could, in most cases, lead to ejaculation in only a few minutes, but typically he prolongs this phase. He does so because, unlike the monkeys, his female is able to experience a sexual climax, similar to his own in emotional intensity, but she usually takes from ten to twenty minutes to do so. This means that, for an ordinary human couple, the whole pattern, including both foreplay and copulation, takes roughly half an hour, which is more than a hundred times as long as for the typical monkey pair. Again, to be fair to the monkeys, they will be likely to repeat their brief encounter much sooner than the human pair, but against this must be set the fact that the female monkey will be receptive only for the few days of her period of heat.

To compare the situation for the female monkey and the female human, the former comes into heat as ovulation time approaches and stays in heat for nearly a week. During this time, copulation neither arouses nor exhausts her sexually. She remains permanently aroused during the whole mating period. For the human female it is as if each mating pattern is a short period of heat, now unrelated to the time of ovulation, but related instead to the pre-copulatory stimulations of the male. She has, in effect, become a mate-responder, rather than an ovulation-responder. Her physiological arousal is geared to the shared sexual intimacies with her male, rather than to the rigidly fixed sequence of the monthly cycle of ovulation and menstruation. This vital step, which represents a fundamental change in the usual primate sexual system, leads inevitably to a far greater degree and complexity of body contact between the mated pair and forms the basis of human sexual intimacy.

This leads us to the question of the origins of the more complex human sexual acts. What are the sources of all the additional body contacts? Since monkeys do little more than mount and copulate, the act of mounting, making rhythmic pelvic thrusts and ejaculating is virtually all we share with them. So from where do we derive all the gentle, hesitant touchings and hand-holdings of the courtship period, and all the passionate arousal actions of sexual foreplay? The answer seems to be that in almost all cases they can be traced back to the intimacies of the mother-infant relationship that were described earlier. Hardly any of them appear to be ‘new’ actions, specifically evolved in connection with sexuality itself. In terms of the behaviour involved, falling in love looks very much like a return to infancy.

In tracing the way in which the primary embrace of our earliest years gradually becomes restricted as we mature, we watched the decline and fall of close body intimacy. Now, as we observe the young lovers, we see the whole process put into reverse. The first actions in the sexual sequence are virtually identical with those of any other kind of adult social interaction. Then, little by little, the hands of the behavioural clock start to turn backwards. The formal handshake and small-talk of the first introduction grow back into the protective hand-holding of childhood. The young lovers now walk hand in hand, as each once did with his or her parent. As their bodies come closer together with increasing trust, we soon witness the welcome return of the intimate frontal embrace, with the two heads touching and kissing. As the relationship deepens, we travel still further back, to the earlier days of gentle caresses. The hands once again fondle the face, the hair and the body of the loved one. At last, the lovers are naked again and, for the first time since they were tiny babies, the most private parts of their bodies experience the intimate touch of another’s hands. And, as their movements travel backwards in time, so too do their voices, the words spoken becoming less important than the soft tonal quality with which they are delivered. Frequently even the phrases used become infantile, as a new kind of ‘baby-talk’ develops. A wave of shared security envelops the young couple and, as in babyhood, the hurly-burly of the outside world has little meaning. The dreamy expression of a girl in love is not the alert face of an active child; it is the almost blank face of a satisfied baby.

This return to intimacy, so beautiful to those who are experiencing it, is often belittled by those who are not. The epigrams tell the story: ‘The first sigh of love is the last of wisdom’; ‘Love is a sickness full of woes’; ‘Love is blind’; ‘We are easily duped by what we love’; ‘Love’s a malady without a cure’; ‘’Tis impossible to love and to be wise’; ‘Lovers are fools, but nature makes them so’. Even in the scientific literature, the term ‘regressive behaviour’ takes on the flavour of an insult, instead of an impartial, objective description of what is taking place. Of course, to behave in an infantile manner in certain adult contexts is an inefficient way of coping with a situation, but here, in the case of young lovers forming a deep bond of personal attachment, it is exactly the opposite. Extensive, intimate body contacts are the very best way of developing such a bond, and those who resist them because they are ‘babyish’ or infantile will be the losers.

When courtship advances to the stage of pre-copulatory behaviour, the infantile patterns do not fade. Instead they grow still younger, and the clock ticks backwards to the sucking at the mother’s breast. The simple kiss, in which lips are gently pressed to the lover’s mouth or cheek, becomes a vigorous, moving pressure. With muscular actions of their lips and tongues, the partners work on one another’s mouths as if to draw milk from them. They suck and squeeze rhythmically with their lips, explore and lick with their tongues, like hungry babies. This active kissing is no longer confined to the partner’s mouth. It seeks other sites, as if searching for the long-lost mother’s nipple. In its quest it travels everywhere, discovering the pseudo-nipples of the ear-lobes, the toes, the clitoris and the penis, and, of course, the lover’s nipples themselves.

Earlier, I mentioned the reward these actions bring from the knowledge of the sexual pleasure they give, but clearly that was only part of the story. There is also this more direct reward of re-experiencing the strongly gratifying oral contact of the suckling interaction in infancy. The effect is heightened where the pseudo-breast can be made to produce pseudo-milk. This can be obtained from the increased salivation of the lover’s mouth, from the increased sexual secretions of the female’s genitals and from the seminal fluid of the male’s penis. If the mouthing of the penis by the female is prolonged until ejaculation occurs, it is as if the action has finally succeeded in starting the ‘milk-flow’ from this pseudo-breast, a similarity which was recognized as long ago as the seventeenth century, when the slang expression ‘milking’ for this activity first came into common usage.

Even when the pre-copulatory patterns are terminated and copulation itself begins, the infantile actions do not completely disappear. For the mating monkeys, the only body contacts, apart from actual genital interaction, are the mechanical holding actions by the male’s hands and feet. He grips the female’s body, not as an amorous intimacy, but to steady himself while he makes the rapid pelvic thrusts. Such graspings also occur between the human partners, but in addition there are many contacts that have no ‘body adjustment’ function. The hands clasp or hold the partner, not for mechanical reasons of thrust facilitation, but as tactile signals of intimacy.

Turning again to the illustrated sexual manuals discussed earlier, and taking only the cases where the male and female were shown actually copulating, it is possible to score the frequency of these non-genital contacts that accompany the pelvic thrusting. In no less than 74 per cent of the copulation postures depicted, the hand (or hands) of one partner clasps or touches some part of the other’s body, in a ‘non-steadying’ way. In addition, there are many embracing acts, kissing acts and non-kissing head-to-head contacts; also a number of hand-to-head and hand-to-hand contacts. All these actions are basically embraces, partial embraces or fragments of embraces. They indicate that, for the human animal, copulation consists of the adult primate mating act plus the returned infantile embracing act. The latter pervades the whole sexual sequence from its earliest courtship stages right through to its final moments. The human animal does not merely copulate with a set of genitals belonging to a member of the opposite sex; it ‘makes love’ – a significant phrase – to a complete and special individual. This is why, in our species, all stages of the sequence, including copulation, can serve to enhance the pair-bonding process, and why, presumably, the female evolved an extended period of sexual receptivity, stretching far beyond the limits of the ovulation period. It could even be said that we now perform the mating act, not so much to fertilize an egg as to fertilize a relationship. There is no reproductive danger in this, for even the small proportion of mating acts that do happen to coincide with the time of ovulation will still be sufficient to produce an adequate number of offspring, and there are more than three thousand million of us alive today to prove the point.fn1
