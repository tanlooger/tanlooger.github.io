title: 7 Object Intimacy
---




ON A HOARDING in Zurich, Switzerland, there is a large poster showing a man’s head reproduced twice, one beside the other. The heads are identical except for one detail: between the lips of one there is a cigarette; between the lips of the other there is instead a baby’s dummy, or pacifier. It is assumed that the message is obvious, since not a single word accompanies the picture. Without realizing it, the designers of this poster have said far more about the importance of smoking than they intended. In one simple visual statement they have explained why so many thousands of people are prepared to risk a painful death, coughing and spewing as their lungs clog with cancerous cells.

The poster is, of course, supposed to put adult smokers to shame by making them feel immature and babyish, but it can also be read backwards. If the man with the dummy in his mouth is gaining some comfort from it, just like a baby, then all that is wrong with that part of the picture is that it looks so infantile. Now switch to the other head – here the problem is solved. Like the dummy, the cigarette gives comfort, too, and in one stroke the babyish element is gone. Seen this way, it might almost be an advertisement to encourage smoking in those who have not yet discovered the basic comfort of this activity. Smoke a cigarette and you can be pacified without feeling immature!

Even if we do not perversely twist the well-intended message in this way, it nevertheless provides us with a valuable clue concerning the world-wide smoking problem that faces society today. It is a problem that has been dealt with recently for the first time. A large-scale campaign to alert smokers to the dangers of filling the lungs with carcinogenic smoke has been undertaken in many countries. Cigarette promotions have been banned on television in several major areas, and there has been endless discussion on how to discourage children from taking up the habit. Gruesome films are shown of pathetic hospital patients in the advanced stages of lung cancer. Some smokers have responded intelligently and given up, but many others have become so alarmed that instead they have been forced to light up an extra cigarette to calm their shattered nerves. In other words, although the problem is at last being dealt with, it is by no means solved. Simply to tell people they must not do something because it is harmful may be a wise step to take, but it is also a short-term one. It is like using war to solve the population problem. War kills millions, but as soon as it is over there is a post-war birth bulge and the population growth goes soaring on again. Similarly, every time there is an anti-smoking scare, thousands of people stop smoking, but after the scare is over, the shares of the cigarette companies start to soar again.

The great error of the anti-smoking campaigners is that they rarely stop and ask the basic question: why do people want to smoke in the first place? They seem to think it has something to do with drug addiction – with the habit-forming effects of nicotine. There is an element of this, certainly, but it is by no means the most important factor operating. Many people do not even inhale their smoke and can be absorbing only minute amounts of the drug, so that the causes of their addiction to cigarettes must be sought elsewhere. The answer clearly lies in the act of oral intimacy involved in holding the object between the lips, as the Zurich poster so beautifully demonstrates, and this answer almost certainly applies as the basic explanation for the full inhalers as well. Until this aspect of smoking is properly investigated, there will be little long-term hope of eliminating it from our stressed, comfort-seeking cultures.

What we are plainly dealing with here is a case of an inanimate object being used as a substitute for a real intimacy with another human being. In examining this phenomenon, we are moving one step further away from the original source – namely, intimacy with intimates. The first step away took us to intimacy with semi-strangers (the professional touchers), the second step took us to intimacy with live substitutes (pet animals), and now the third step takes us into the world of dummies – objects with a hidden intimacy factor. There are many of them besides the cigarette, but it helps to start with this one because it leads us naturally back to the start of the whole story, at the point where a distraught mother jams a rubber substitute for her nipple into the mouth of her screaming infant.

The baby’s dummy, sometimes called a pacifier or a comforter, is usually described as a ‘blind’ nipple, since, unlike the teat of a feeding-bottle, it has no hole in it. The description is a little misleading because no mother can boast such a huge bulbous nipple as that found on the average commercial dummy. This is a super-nipple, milkless, but with a greatly magnified tactile quality. At its outer end there is a flat disc to simulate the mother’s breast and to stop the rubber super-nipple being sucked right into the mouth.

Dummies of this sort have been in use for centuries, but not so long ago they fell into disrepute because they were considered a dangerous source of infection. More recently they have started to make a comeback, and today they are recommended in many cases by medical authorities. Babies given dummies in their early months are much less likely to become thumb-suckers (the obvious alternative if no nipple is available to give comfort when comfort is needed). Also, it is no longer believed that dummies deform the mouth or damage the developing teeth, and recent experiments have shown the experts what many mothers knew already, namely that dummies do have a really dramatic calming effect upon a distressed infant. ‘Non-nutritive sucking’, as it is officially termed, was studied carefully in a large number of babies and their responses recorded. It was found that after only thirty seconds with the dummy in the mouth, crying was reduced to one-fifth of its previous level, and agitated hand and foot movements to one-half. It was also pointed out that, even without active sucking, the presence of the super-nipple between the baby’s lips has a calming effect. If a baby is half asleep and has stopped sucking, the removal of the dummy can easily start it crying again.

All this adds up to the fact that having something between the lips is a comforting experience for the human animal, since it spells reassuring contact with the primary protector, the mother. It is a powerful form of symbolic intimacy, and when we look at an old man sucking contentedly on the stem of his pipe, it becomes abundantly clear that it is one that stays with us all our lives.

The important thing for the adult ‘sucker’ is that he should not appear to be doing what he is doing; hence the message of the Zurich poster. The use of a baby’s dummy by a stressed adult would probably be as calming as anything else, if only it did not carry the ‘infantile’ stigma. Since it does, however, he is forced to adopt disguised dummies of various kinds. The cigarette, in this respect at least, is ideal, because it is so totally adult. Being prohibited for children means that it is not only non-infantile, but also non-childlike, and therefore completely removed in context from the baby-sucking that is its true origin. The object feels soft between the lips and the smoke warms it, which makes it even more like the genuine mother’s nipple than a rubber dummy. Furthermore, the sensation of something being sucked out of the end of it and drawn down the throat adds to the illusion. A new symbolic equation is set up: warm inhaled smoke equals mother’s warm milk.

Many smokers, when putting a cigarette to their mouths, or when taking it away, let their fingers fall on the outsides of their lips, simulating in this way the touch of the mother’s breast. Some put the cigarette between their lips and leave it there for long periods of time, only drawing on it occasionally. When they do this, the non-drawing moments are similar to those of the half-asleep baby who still held the dummy in its mouth after it had stopped sucking on it. Other smokers, when they take the cigarette from the mouth, continue to fondle it between their fingers, even though it would be easy to put it down on an ashtray or some other surface. Deeply stained ‘nicotine fingers’ bear silent testimony to this urge to hold on to the comforting tobacco-nipple, even when it is not in oral use.

Variations on this theme include the businessman’s super-nipple, the cigar, the tip of which is suitably rounded and smooth where it touches the mouth. With quiet ceremony this smooth ‘blind’ nipple is pierced and snipped with special gadgets, to ease the comforting flow of warming smoke-milk. For some, the soft touch of the cigarette or cigar is sacrificed to increased smoothness in the form of a cigarette-holder, a cigar-holder or a pipe. Here the tongue can play with a surface as smooth and slippery as a nipple of flesh or a teat of rubber. It is surprising that some device has not been used that is both soft and slippery – say a rubber holder – but perhaps this would not be sufficiently disguised, and would begin to look too much like the real thing to maintain its adult respectability. It would certainly make it more difficult for pipe-smokers to employ one of their favourite devices, namely sucking an empty pipe. That is already getting dangerously close to the obvious, and a rubber pipe-stem would be the final give-away.

The enormous amount of tobacco-smoking that takes place around the world today bears evidence to the vast demand that exists for comforting acts of symbolic intimacy. If the damaging side-effects of this pattern of behaviour are to be eradicated, it will be necessary either to de-stress the population to the appropriate degree, or to provide alternatives. Since there is no sign of any great or immediate hope for the former, the solution will have to be the latter. Plastic cigarettes have been suggested and even tried, but there seems little hope for them. The suggestion is valid enough in itself, but it overlooks the important factors of the warmth and true ‘suckability’ of real cigarettes. Also, it fails to provide any official excuse for the action. There must be a disguise of some kind if the activity is to be readily acceptable. It is true that many people suck the ends of pencils, pens, matchsticks, and the tips of the side-pieces of spectacles, but all these objects have other ‘official’ functions. A plastic cigarette would fail in this respect and would therefore appear too much like the baby’s dummy in the Zurich poster. Some other solution will have to be found, and it looks very much as though this will have to come from the cigarette manufacturers themselves, in the form of a synthetic or herbal tobacco that does not damage the lungs. Research is already progressing in this direction, and perhaps the most valuable contribution made by the recent lung-cancer scares and propaganda campaigns will be to force a drastic speeding up in these investigations. Bearing in mind the deep significance of smoking, as I have outlined it here, this is probably the only long-term way in which these campaigns will be able to help.

Those people who have given up smoking, or who have attempted to give it up, complain that they start getting fatter soon after they abandon their non-nutritional tobacco-nipples. This immediately gives a clue about certain kinds of feeding. A great deal of the nibbling and food-sucking we do is primarily concerned with symbolic oral intimacies, rather than true adult food-intake. The cigarette-hungry ex-smoker, when in sudden need of added comfort, grabs a sweet food morsel and stuffs it into his nipple-empty mouth. Sucking candies and sweets is yet another of our disguised breast-feeding substitutes. For most of us it is the pattern of behaviour that fills the gap between the dummies of infancy and the cigarettes of adulthood. The confectionery shop is the world of the child. Too old for rubber pacifiers, he takes to sucking gob-stoppers and bull’s-eyes, lollipops and sticks of seaside rock. They may rot the teeth, but they help to replace the lost comfort. As adults we largely turn our backs on these delights, but many a young lover still brings to his ‘sweetheart’ the comforting gift of a box of assorted chocolate nipples. And many a bored housewife dips into a box of soothing candies. A trick sometimes used to give these objects adult respectability is to fill them with anti-childish alcohol and pop them into our mouths in the form of ‘liqueur chocolates’.

Although these food objects do not last as long as nipples, they do have the important qualities of softness and sweetness to help them in their symbolic role. One special form overcomes this drawback of being short-lived, and that is chewing-gum. Chewing-gum consists of an elastic substance known as chicle gum, sweetened and flavoured. (One part of chicle gum to three parts of sugar, warmed and kneaded together and flavoured with cloves and cinnamon, wintergreen or peppermint.) It can be chewed for hour after hour and is advertised as something to ‘calm your nerves and help you concentrate’. Symbolically, it is nothing short of a rubbery, detachable nipple. Because of its special properties it should enjoy enormous success, but it is badly hindered by the conspicuous jaw movements that accompany its use. These cause no problem for the chewer, but for those near him they create the impression that he is incessantly eating. Since he never swallows the ‘food’ in his mouth, this conveys the feeling that the object in his mouth is in some way unpleasant, like a tough piece of gristle, and as he becomes soothed, his observers become irritated. The result has been that, in many social settings, chewing a piece of gum has become looked upon as a ‘dirty habit’, and the activity has therefore remained a restricted one.

Since mother’s milk is a warm, sweet liquid, it is not surprising that adults employ a variety of warm, sweet drinks to soothe themselves at moments of tension or boredom. The millions of gallons of tea, coffee, drinking-chocolate and cocoa that are consumed annually have little to do with the real demands of thirst, but again thirst is there to provide the vital official excuse. The cups and mugs from which we sip these milk-substitutes so eagerly also provide a pleasantly smooth, slippery surface to press against our comfort-seeking lips, and the outcry when modern ‘disposability’ demands the use of non-smooth, non-slippery paper cups is easy to understand.

Once more, it is interesting to see the way we avoid the obvious: we drink tea hot, but milk cold. To drink hot milk is too overtly babyish. Only invalids drink hot milk, but that is permissible because, as we have already seen, the invalid has given up the adult struggle and has become an ‘instant-baby’ in other ways as well, so for him one more baby pattern makes no difference.

Apart from cold milk, or milk-shakes, which significantly are usually sucked through a straw, there are many other types of cold, sweet drink that we employ as comforters. They are nearly always advertised as thirst-quenchers, but in this respect they always fall far short of simple, plain water. They do, however, provide that vital sweet taste, and the increasingly acceptable habit of drinking them straight from the bottle helps to improve their symbolic value. The bottles in question have therefore shrunk in size from the traditional dimensions down to something remarkably close to that of the baby’s bottle. In fact, if someone were to emulate the Zurich cigarette poster and show a man drinking from a cola or lemonade bottle with a rubber teat on it, the game would be up.

Many other objects, such as the stems of plants, or the beads of a necklace worn around the neck, are often brought up to the lips in fleeting moments of self-comfort, but enough has been said now to show that the oral intimacies of infancy remain an important part of our adult lives, even outside the more obvious spheres of friendly or sexual kissing, and we can move on to consider other parts of the adult body.

Another basic form of contact in babyhood is the pressing of the cheek against the mother’s body when resting. Cheek-pressing with soft substitute objects is rare amongst adult males, but it remains fairly common with females. Many advertisements for soft bedding, blankets and linen display a serenely smiling female hugging to her body the cuddly product, her head tilted to one side and her cheek pressed lovingly to the smooth surface of the cloth. This is particularly common with blanket advertisements, to the extent that it is almost the only pose employed, despite the obvious fact that, once on the bed, the blanket will be prevented from making such a contact by the intervention of the inevitable bed-sheets.

Fur coat advertisements follow a similar course, frequently showing the fur collar turned up, or pushed up with the hands, so that its ultra-soft surface caresses the wearer’s cheeks. Fur rugs offer a more extensive contact surface, like a giant maternal body flattened out on the floor or bed.

Perhaps the most widespread and common form of soft cheek contact, and one that is employed by both males and females, is the use of a down-filled pillow when sleeping at night. The caress of this tender pillow-breast provides a major soothing element at the end of the day, helping to calm us into a condition where we are prepared at last to sink into a deep slumber and give up the adult battle of the day. Great subtlety has been employed by pillow manufacturers in producing exactly the right balance between springiness and softness, and at any large bedding store it is possible to select a new pillow from a wide range of slightly varying tactile qualities. For many adults, one particular pillow, or pillow ‘strength’, becomes extremely important as an aid to falling asleep, and if they are faced (in both senses of the word) with the wrong type of pillow when trying to sleep in a strange bed, at a hotel or in a friend’s house, they may find it difficult to drift off into a peaceful sleep as quickly as they can at home. This phenomenon is much more pronounced in the case of ‘home-lovers’ who travel little and who, over a period of years, become fixated on a specific pillow quality, such as resilience, thickness or sagginess.

A similar development occurs with the rest of the bed. In addition to sensitive pillow responses, adults come to prefer a particular softness or hardness in the mattress beneath them, and a certain lightness or heaviness, a looseness or a tight ‘tucked-in-ness’ in the bedding that covers them, as they settle down to the vitally important nocturnal bed-embrace that will envelop them for a total of one-third of their entire lives.

In 1970 a new type of bed appeared on the market in America – the ‘waterbed’. Essentially, this is a vinyl mattress filled with water. Lying on it, the sleeper sinks gently into its liquid embrace as if returning to a semi-womb. A thermostat and heating element inside it keeps the water at an appropriately soothing temperature. In the second half of 1970, over 15,000 of these beds were sold, and the demand soon outstripped the supply. The advertisers encouraged their prospective buyers with significant phrases such as ‘Live and love in liquid luxury’ and ‘You can make them rock-and-roll you to sleep’. The only hazard, to use a gynaecological expression, is rupturing the membrane. Accidentally puncturing a waterbed is almost as messy and comfortless as being born. Perhaps this slight but nagging fear will, in the end, keep most of us wrapped in the safer embrace of our old-fashioned cloth-beds.

Examined objectively, our sleeping habits, with our soft pillows, bedding and mattresses, begin to take on a special significance. They are more than a device for acquiring dream-time, in order for our computer-brains to sort out and file away the confusing bombardment of new thoughts from the past day, and much more than the mere act of obtaining physical rest for the exertions of the new day that is coming. They represent also a massive, world-wide indulgence in abandoning ourselves to the comforting intimacy of an inanimate envelopment that is part cloth-womb and part cloth-mother embrace.

Even during our waking hours we do not entirely reject these primal delights, as the modern furniture industry can demonstrate so clearly. ‘Easy’ chairs and sofas, of a voluptuous softness and bed-like snugness unknown in previous centuries, have become the almost inevitable centre-piece of every drawing-room, sitting-room and lounge. There, at the end of the hard working day, we sink gratefully into the soft intimacy of our favourite piece of soft furniture, whose ‘arms’ may not actually embrace us, but whose yielding surfaces nevertheless provide great body comfort. Cuddled snugly on the symbolic laps of our chair-mothers, we then settle down with childlike security to view at a safe distance the chaos of the harsh adult world outside, as symbolically portrayed on our television screens or between the covers of our novels.

If, in describing the act of watching television from the soft comfort of an easy chair in this way, as an infantile act similar to looking out of a window while safely held on a mother’s lap, I appear to be condemning it, I hasten to add that this is not my intention. On the contrary, it is an added advantage to this now world-wide pattern of behaviour. In addition to providing entertainment and education, the act of watching television can, as I have shown, provide a vitally important soothing element in our stressful adult world. The glass screen that covers the pictures we watch traps them safely inside the television box where they cannot harm us. This helps to compensate for the fact that our chair-mothers only provide one of the two vital security factors that the real mother gives to her infant. The real mother provides both the intimacy of soft body contact and protection against the outside world. Our chair-mothers provide only the soft contact – they cannot protect us. But this is where the inpenetrable glass surface of the television screen comes to our rescue, compensating for the missing protection by safely walling us off from the adult dramas unfolding inside the box. The symbolic equation is therefore simple enough: real mother that protects and comforts = screen that protects + chair-mother that comforts.

Viewing our home life in this way, it is not surprising to find that when we travel or go on a vacation most of us prefer to stay in hotels which simulate in almost every way the conditions we once knew in the nursery. As in our infancy, everything is done for us and we do not need to lift a finger. Our food is prepared by the chef-mother, served to us by the waitress-mother, and our beds are made and our rooms cleaned by the maid-mother. At the best hotels, the use of room service can take us back virtually to the cradle, with our baby-crying replaced by the simple act of pressing the wall-button or lifting the house-phone. And frequently one of the first things that people do when they become rich is to introduce these nursery conditions into their own homes by employing personal staff-mothers. Also, as I pointed out in an earlier chapter, the sick-bed and the hospital provide a similar condition for the invalid who has temporarily given up the adult struggle completely.

Sometimes we indulge ourselves briefly in the even more basic luxury of a return to a womb-like condition by the act of taking a hot bath. It is no accident that nearly all of us prefer to do this at womb-temperature, floating blissfully in our mock-amniotic fluid and feeling beautifully secure inside the curving walls of our bath-wombs, with the bathroom door safely locked against the adult world outside. Sooner or later, however, we are forced to remove the cervical bath-plug and reluctantly face the trauma of a new birth. As if knowing of our fears at this dreaded moment, the towel manufacturers compete to provide us with the softest embrace they can produce. As one towelling advertisement puts it, ‘Our towels just hug you dry!’; and the girl in the accompanying picture is shown clutching the object in question ecstatically to her body and face, as if her very life depended on it.

When this towel-hugging girl finally gets dressed, she need not fear that these tender intimacies will cease. Advertisers of body clothing – underwear, sweaters, skirts, and the rest – all promise her similar rewards. Those brief panties are much more, it seems, than a matter of mere modesty, for we learn that they also offer you a ‘bare hug’ which ‘gently, caressingly … stretches to follow every curve of your body’. And those tights – they are ‘silky soft and sensual’ and ‘hug you snugly from top to toe’, not to mention those stockings which ‘embrace your legs in a gentle, lingering caress’, or those jersey dresses with that ‘clinging feeling’. The lucky girl can therefore walk about fully dressed and apparently alone, but symbolically clad in a whole mass of caressing, embracing, hugging cloth-lover intimacies. If all the clothing advertisements put together had a cumulative effect, it would be surprising if she could perform the simple act of crossing a room without experiencing a multiple orgasm. Luckily for her real lovers, however, the impact of her assorted cloth-lovers is much milder, in most cases, than the advertisers would have us believe. Nevertheless, mild though it may be, it is still a genuine and important part of the body reward of wearing the soft and comfortable clothing of today.

This intimacy between clothing and wearer is more than a one-way affair. Not only do the clothes embrace the wearer – in addition, the wearer also embraces the clothes. This is, after all, a fair return for all that snug hugging and gentle caressing. The favourite way of repaying the compliment is to thrust one or both hands deep into some suitable fold of cloth. Napoleon’s characteristic pose, with one hand inserted into his jacket, immediately comes to mind, but today the most widespread version is the hands-in-pockets action. Pockets are officially there to carry small objects, and if we put a hand into one, it is supposedly in the process of taking something out. But the vast majority of hand-in-pocket poses have nothing to do with object-retrieving. Instead, they are prolonged contact actions in which we, so to speak, hold hands with our pockets. Schoolboys and soldiers are often ordered to ‘take your hands out of your pockets’, with no explanation given other than that it is slovenly or untidy. The truth is, of course, that the posture indicates that they have relaxed into a symbolic act of intimacy, and this conflicts with their official roles as attentive, subordinate males. For males who are not restricted in this way, there are several alternatives open, and the choice made in any particular instance follows a rather curious rule. It is this: the higher up the body the hand/clothing contact is made, the more assertive it is. The most assertive of all is the grasping of the lapels. Coming a close second is the thumbs-in-waistcoat action. Next is the Napoleonic hand-in-jacket-front posture. Further down there is the hands-in-jacket-side-pockets pose, and further still the very common hands-in-trouser-pockets. Going any lower, with a hands-grasp-trouser-legs action, becomes appropriately low on the assertiveness scale.

The reason for this rule seems to be that the higher up the hand goes in making the contact, the more it adopts what amounts to an intention movement of striking a blow. Whenever a real blow is struck, it must be preceded by a raising of the hitting arm, prior to lashing out at the opponent. As we have already seen, this action becomes frozen as a formal signal in the case of the raised fist of the communist salute. The firm grasping of the lapels goes a long way towards this – as far, in fact, as a hand-to-clothing contact can go – and it is natural therefore that this should be the most truculent message of the various alternatives. Along with the thumbs-in-waistcoat posture, it has become almost a caricature of assertiveness, and a serious dominant male today is much more likely to adopt the lower-level hands-in-jacket-side-pockets posture when he finds himself displayed in a public place. This latter action is particularly favoured by tycoons, generals, admirals and political leaders, and it also became a cliché posture for the big-time gangsters of the roaring ’twenties. Such men are much more reluctant to adopt the lower-level posture of hands-in-trouser-pockets, at least when they are in a context that demands the assertion of their dominant rights.

An intriguing exception to the above rule is the thumbs-hooked-in-belt posture. Although this occurs rather low down on the body, it conveys a decidedly truculent flavour. It is popular with ‘he-men’, cowboys, pseudo-cowboys and mock-aggressive girls. Its assertive qualities appear to stem not only from a quick-on-the-draw intention movement, but also from the fact that it has become the modern, waistcoatless version of the old-fashioned thumbs-in-waistcoat posture. Sometimes the whole hand is slipped beneath the belt, or into the top of the trousers, but it then immediately loses much of its aggressiveness and fits more suitably on to the scale outlined above.

In addition to these actions, there are many small ways in which the hands perform minor intimacies with different parts of the clothing. All of them appear under stress, and many of them seem to represent symbolic versions of grooming acts that we would like someone else to be applying to our bodies to soothe us. Men can frequently be seen adjusting their cuff-links or smoothing their ties. President Kennedy frequently fingered his central jacket button at moments of public stress. Winston Churchill was often pictured at times of tension with his hand pressed flatly against the lower part of his jacket, as if engaged in a fragmentary self-embrace.

With the female sex, bracelets and necklaces come in for a great deal of handling and fingering at moments of strain, just as nuns no doubt obtain soothing comfort from the physical actions of telling their beads. At other times, the smooth caress of lipstick on lips, or powder-puff on cheeks, will provide a reassuring sensation of touch for a nervous female taking time off from a stressful social engagement. At more private moments, the repeated combing or brushing of hair, far beyond the demands of ‘hair adjustment’, can also have a marked calming effect, playing the role of a self-directed lover’s caress.

In some instances, the act of making contact with a companion is performed indirectly, through an intermediate object of some kind, as when we clink our glasses together in making a toast, instead of making direct skin contact. A classic example can be found in any old Victorian scrap-book where a family group photograph has been taken. Typically, the mother sits in a central chair, with the latest addition to the large family nestled on her lap. Her husband, whose natural inclination is to put his arm around her shoulder, is too inhibited to do this in so public a situation and instead embraces the back of the chair in which she is sitting. The modern version of this can often be seen when two friends sit together informally and one stretches his arm along the back of the sofa they are sharing, aiming it in the direction of the other’s back. Similarly, if a person is sitting alone in a chair, he may embrace the arms of it lovingly while talking animatedly to a companion in a chair opposite. Occasionally, additional chair-comfort is obtained by the use of a rocking-chair – another favourite action of President Kennedy’s when under stress. The rocking comfort, needless to say, relates directly back to the rocking of the cradle or the mother’s arms.

Finally we come to those objects that provide, quite specifically, substitutions for sexual intimacies. At the mildest level there are the photographs of loved ones, or the ‘pin-ups’ of those we would like to make love to, which can be kissed and touched in the unavoidable absence of the real thing. The use of life-size ‘pillow-posters’ is a new trend in the direction, it now being possible to buy a pillow-slip imprinted with a picture of the face of a favourite film star, to fit over the pillow that graces your bed. Then, at bedtime, you can lie cheek to cheek with the adored one, and fall gently asleep in this surrogate, cloth embrace.

Moving on to copulation itself, it was claimed during World War II that enemy soldiers (it is always enemy soldiers) at the front line were supplied with inflatable rubber dummy-females, complete with sexual orifices, for purposes of relieving sexual tensions. Whether this was merely propaganda to show how sex-starved and badly off the enemy were, or whether it actually happened, I have not been able to ascertain.

Inanimate substitutes for the male penis have, by contrast, a long and factual history, and even rate a mention in the Old Testament. Usually called dildoes, but also referred to as godemiches, consolateurs, bijoux indiscrets and dil-dols, they were known even before biblical times, and appear in ancient Babylonian sculptures dating from hundreds of years before Christ. In ancient Greece they had the name ‘olisbos’, meaning ‘slippery bull’, and they were apparently particularly popular amongst the Turkish harems. As the centuries passed, their use spread to practically every land in the world. Their popularity waxed and waned, apparently reaching a peak in the eighteenth century, when they were sold openly in London, a phenomenon not encountered again until the second half of the present century. Great care and skill is said to have been put into their manufacture ‘so as to enhance realism in a coition fantasy’. In the 1970s they are now on sale in several versions in the ‘sex shops’ of a number of Western countries. Those that are not purchased by males out of sheer curiosity are used by lesbians or by solitary females for the purpose of masturbation.

Two forms of mechanically operated dildo have also appeared in recent times. One sort was of a highly technical nature, designed especially for an American research investigation into the nature of human copulation. Devised by radio-physicists, electrically powered, made of plastic with the optical properties of plate glass, equipped with cold-light illumination to facilitate intra-vaginal film-making, and fitted with masturbator-operated controls for varying both speed and depth of thrust, this was, by any standards, a truly remarkable instrument, a sensitive and tireless dummy lover, the sex-surrogate to end all sex-surrogates. A less ambitious and much less expensive mechanical device, and one that has gained widespread popularity in recent years, is the comparatively simple ‘vibrator’, or ‘vibro massager’. It is a small, smooth-surfaced, battery-operated, plastic object, long and thin, with a rounded tip, the original and official function of which was localized muscle massage. It soon found a new and more sexual function as a gently vibrating masturbation dildo, and since it could be bought in its official role as a simple massage machine, had the added advantage that it could be obtained without undue embarrassment by purchasers who would have hesitated to acquire the more obvious forms of sexual equipment. Even in the outspoken underground press, the charade is maintained. A typical advertisement reads: ‘Personal Massagers – penetrating, stimulating massager. Throbs away aches and frustrating pains. 7 in. long by 1½ in. Standard batteries included.’ The coyness employed in this advertisement is completely out of step with the rest of the text of underground papers, where the bluntest and most uninhibited forms of sexual comment are to be found. Once again we see the operation of the rule we have met so many times before, namely that adult intimacies require some sort of disguise, either to ourselves or to others, to obscure the real purpose of what is going on.

A most unusual and ingenious form of sex-surrogate sometimes used by females in Japan is the rin-no-tama, also known as the watama or ben-wa. This consists of two hollow balls, roughly the size of pigeon’s eggs, which are inserted into the vagina. Originally made of leaf brass, but nowadays probably of plastic, one ball is empty and the other contains a small quantity of quicksilver (mercury). The empty ball is inserted first and pushed up to the end of the vagina, next to the cervix. The second is then placed against it and the opening of the vagina plugged with paper or cotton. Thus equipped, and with no embarrassing outward signs of her peculiar condition, the female proceeds to amuse herself with apparent innocence by swinging on a swing or rocking in a rocking-chair. The rhythmic back-and-forth motions then produce shifting pressures inside the vagina which simulate the thrusting of a male penis. Although, as a sexual ‘toy’, the rin-no-tama has the great advantage of permitting private enjoyment in public, it has not achieved the widespread popularity of the ubiquitous vibrator, presumably because, unlike the latter, it lacks a non-sexual, ‘official’ function.

Toys themselves, of completely non-sexual types, should also, incidentally, be a medium where tactile rewards are made available to us through inanimate objects. The possibilities are enormous, but few are attempted and even fewer succeed. When they do appear, they are usually presented as some kind of athletic exercise. The trampoline was one. The main reward here was the strange sensation of being embraced by the springy surface, flung into the air and then embraced again in a new posture. But the whole process had to be carried out under the cover of a highly muscular and sporting atmosphere, which ruled it out for many people. The short-lived hula-hoop was another case, combining the rotating embrace of the hoop around the performer’s waist with an undulating action of the hips. Its appeal, however, was strictly limited and did not survive past the novelty stage.

The art world has several times attempted to present intimacy objects to an intimacy-hungry world, but with little success. In 1942 the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited for the first time a new type of sculpture called ‘handies’ or hand sculpture. They consisted of small, smoothly rounded pieces of polished wood in abstract shapes that would fit comfortably into the human hand and could be squeezed and turned this way and that to vary the tactile sensation. The artist who created them stressed that they were meant to be felt rather than looked at, and suggested that they would make an excellent substitute for cigarettes, chewing-gum or doodling for those who tended to be fidgety in committee meetings. Unhappily, it was not to be, and handies have hardly been heard of since. Once again, the message was too obvious, no committee member wishing it to be known that he was so obviously in need of a little comforting pseudo-body contact.

More recently, in the 1960s, certain artists have attempted more ambitious assaults on the bodies of art-lovers by creating ‘environmental sculptures’. These have taken many forms, some of which have included a kind of play-space into which the visitor walks, there to be assailed by a series of varying tactile impressions as he passes through tubes, tunnels and passageways, walled and hung with a wide variety of textures and substances. Again, success has been short-lived and great possibilities have been wasted.

A final example neatly sums up the whole situation. One particular artist devised a simulated copulation capsule, into which the ‘art-lover’ was placed and wired up in various ways. The capsule was then shut and the machine switched on, with the idea of producing a massive sensory experience. At an art institute, the creator of this machine delivered a lecture about his concepts to an engrossed audience, who listened with interest as he explained that, owing to technical hitches, he had now devised a much simpler version of the machine, in which he had great faith. The modified device consisted basically of a large vertical sheet of rubber, or some such material, with a small hole at genital height, through which a male art-lover could insert his penis. For the female art-lover there was a similar vertical sheet, with a penis-shape protruding through it. In serious tones he then explained that, in addition to its simplicity, this new exhibit had the advantage that it could be used simultaneously by a male and female art-lover, with one standing on each side of it.

The absurdity of this story brings us back inevitably to the inherent absurdity of many of the examples given in the present chapter. It is absurd that an adult human being should have to coat his lungs with carcinogens in order to enjoy a crude substitute of the pleasures he once knew at his mother’s breast, or when a baby’s bottle was held to his lips. And it is absurd that grown men should endlessly have to mouth a disembodied, rubberized nipple in the form of chewing-gum, or that adult females should have to use a plastic massager instead of a live penis to achieve sexual gratification. But although these actions may seem absurd, pathetic or even downright repulsive to some, to many they are the only solution that seems to be available, and it must always be borne in mind that any intimacy, no matter how far removed it becomes from the real thing, is still better than the frightening loneliness of no intimacy at all. In other words, we must stop attacking the symptoms and take a closer look instead at the causes of the problem. If only we can become more intimate with our ‘intimates’, then we should need less and less in the way of substitutes for intimacy. In the meantime, almost any dummy-touch is better than no touch.
