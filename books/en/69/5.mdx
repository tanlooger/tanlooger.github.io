title: 5 Specialized Intimacy
---




BY STUDYING THE behaviour of infants and lovers, it becomes clear that the degree of physical intimacy that exists between two human animals relates to the degree of trust between them. The crowded conditions of modern life surround us with strangers whom we do not trust, at least not fully, and we go to great pains to keep our distance from them. The intricate avoidance patterns of any busy street bear witness to this. But the frenzy of urban living creates stress, and stress breeds anxiety and feelings of insecurity. Intimacy calms these feelings, and so, paradoxically, the more we are forced to keep apart, the more we need to make body contact. If our loved ones are loving enough, then the supply of intimacy they offer will suffice, and we can go out to face the world at arm’s length. But supposing they are not; supposing we have failed as adults to form close bonds with either friends or lovers, and have no children; what do we do then? Or supposing we have formed these bonds successfully, but then they have broken down, or become fossilized into the remoteness of indifference, with the ‘loving’ embrace and kiss becoming as formalized as a public handshake; what then? The answer for many is simply to grouse and bear it, but there are solutions, and one of these is the device of employing professional touchers, a measure which helps to some extent to compensate for the shortcomings of the amateur and amatory touchers who are failing to supply us with our much-needed quota of body intimacy.

Who are these professional touchers? The answer is that they are virtually any strangers or semi-strangers who, under the pretext of providing us with some specialist service, are required to touch our bodies. This pretext is necessary because, of course, we do not like to admit that we are insecure and need the comforting touch of another human body. That would be ‘soft’, immature, regressive; it would assail our image of ourselves as self-controlled, independent adults. And so we must get our dose of intimacy in some disguised form.

One of the most popular and widespread methods is being ill. Nothing serious, of course, merely some mild sickness that will stimulate in others the urge to perform comforting acts in intimacy. The majority of people imagine that when they fall prey to some minor ailment, they have simply been unlucky in accidentally encountering a hostile virus, bacterium, or some other form of parasite. If they come down with a nasty bout of influenza, for instance, they feel it could have happened to anyone – anyone who, like them, has been shopping in busy stores, standing on tightly packed buses, or jamming themselves into stuffy corners at overcrowded parties, where coughs and sneezes can be heard incessantly wafting their eager pathogens through the air. The facts, however, do not support this view. Even at the height of a flu epidemic, there are still many people – equally exposed to the infection – who do not succumb. How is it that they manage to avoid taking to their sick-beds? How, in particular, does the medical profession manage to remain so remarkably healthy? They, more than anyone, are massively exposed to infection all day and every day, but they do not seem to become proportionally sick.

Minor ailments, therefore, do not appear to be entirely a matter of unlucky accident. In a modern city there are hostile microbes everywhere. Almost every day, and in almost every place we walk and breathe, we are exposed to sufficient of them to bring us down with some sort of infection. If we defeat them, it is not so much that we manage to avoid them as that our bodies are equipped with a highly efficient defence system which slaughters them by the million, week in and week out. If we succumb, it is not so much that we have been accidentally exposed to them as that we have, for some reason, lowered our body defences. One way we do this (apart from excessive hygiene!) is to let ourselves become overstressed and overstrained by the pressures of urban life. In our weakened condition, we soon fall prey to one or other of the wide selection of unfriendly microbes that fill the world around us. Luckily for us, the disease is its own cure, for, in putting us to bed, it provides us with the very comfort we were lacking before. We might call this the ‘instant-baby’ syndrome.

The man who is feeling ‘poorly’ begins to look weak and helpless and starts to transmit powerful pseudo-infantile signals to his wife. She responds automatically as an ‘instant-parent’ and begins to mother him, insisting on tucking him up in his bed (cot) and bringing him soup, hot drinks and medicine (baby food). Her tone of voice becomes softer (the maternal coo) and she fusses over him, feeling his forehead and performing other intimacies of a kind that were missing before, when he was fit and well but equally in need of them. The curative effect of this comfort behaviour works wonders and he is soon back in action again, facing the hostile world outside.

This description does not imply malingering. It is essential for the patient to be truly and visibly sick in order to stimulate fully the necessary pseudo-parental care. This accounts for the high frequency of strongly debilitating, but comparatively pain-free, minor ailments in cases of emotionally induced illness. It is important, not only to be sick, but to be seen to be sick.

To some, these comments will seem cynical, but that is not my intention. If the stress of life demands that we shall obtain increased comfort and intimacy from our closest companions, and forces us once again to sink into the warm embrace of the soft bedding of our ‘cots’, then this is a valuable social mechanism and must not be sneered at.

It is, indeed, so useful a device that it has come to support a major industry. Despite all the impressive technological advances of modern medicine and our so-called conquest of the environment, we still get sick at an astonishingly high rate. The majority of the victims do not see the inside of a hospital ward. They may be out-patients, pharmacy clients, or merely self-treating in the home. They suffer from a great variety of common ailments such as coughs, colds, influenza, headaches, allergies, backaches, tonsillitis, laryngitis, stomach-aches, ulcers, diarrhoea, skin rashes, and the like. The fashions change from generation to generation – once it was ‘the vapours’, now it is ‘a virus’ – but basically the list remains much the same. In terms of simple frequency of occurrence, these cases account for the vast majority of present-day illnesses.

In Britain, for example, over 500 million pharmaceutical purchases are made every year to treat minor illnesses, which works out at roughly ten ailments per year, per head of the population. Some 100 million pounds is spent annually on these products. Over two-thirds of all illnesses are not serious enough to involve the services of a doctor.

The reason for this situation is simple enough. All the time, our populations are increasing in size and our communities becoming more and more overcrowded and overstressed. The larger numbers of people involved means that there is more and more money available for medical research, which finds better and better cures. In the meantime, however, the populations have grown again, the social stresses have become greater and the susceptibility to disease has increased. Therefore more medical research is needed, and so on, neck and neck, into an imaginary, disease-free future that will never come.

But suppose for a moment that I am being pessimistic; suppose that some medical miracle has eventually appeared on the scene and defeated and exterminated all the parasites. Will we then finally have arrived at a condition where the downtrodden, emotionally bruised urbanite can no longer collapse with impunity into the comforting arms of his sick-bed? The chances are more than remote that this miracle will ever happen, but even if it did there are still several alternatives open to the would-be ‘instant-baby’. These are already in frequent use. In the absence of suitable viruses or bacteria, he can always have a ‘nervous breakdown’. Minor mental illnesses have the advantage that they can operate in the absence of acquired microbes, and they are equally effective as comfort-producers. Indeed, they are so effective that even a murderer can plead ‘temporary insanity’ as an excuse for his actions and have his sentence modified on the grounds of ‘diminished responsibility’ – again being treated as if he were a ‘temporary infant’. Pleading that he was suffering from a cold in the head at the time of the murder would provide less comfort to him, so there is clearly a lot to be said for the power of mental breakdown as a survival device when stress becomes extreme. The main disadvantage here is that many of the milder versions of mental illness are lacking in the external symptoms necessary to provoke the much-needed comforting reactions. The emotionally bruised individual is driven to extremes to produce the required response. Internal agonizing is not enough, but after a good bout of screaming hysterics, his collapsed body stands a very high chance of feeling itself snugly enveloped in the embracing arms of an earnest comforter. If the breakdown is more violent, he may instead find himself encased in forcibly restraining arms, but even then all is not lost, for he will have succeeded, albeit in a desperate way, in making some kind of intimate body contact with another human being. Only if he loses control completely will he fail and find himself condemned to the solitary self-embrace imposed by the canvas sleeves of a strait-jacket.

A second alternative in the absence of foreign parasites is the use of the patient’s own endogenous microbes, the ones that he has been carrying on his body all his life. To explain how this works, we must take a close look, in fact a microscopic look, at the surfaces of our bodies.

Many people seem to imagine that all microbes are nasty and that they automatically mean disease or dirt, but this is not true. As any bacteriologist will testify, this is nothing more than the modern myth of the new hygiene religion, the religion whose aerosol prayers keep its worshippers ‘free from all known germs’, whose holy water is antiseptic solution, and whose god is totally sterile. Of course, there are vicious, deadly germs that we do well to destroy as ruthlessly as possible. There is no denying that. But what about the ‘germs’ whose main activity in life is killing off other germs? Do we really want to kill all known germs?

The fact is that we are each of us protected by a vast army of friendly microbes that do not hinder us but, on the contrary, actively help us to keep healthy. On our healthy, clean skin there is an average of five million of them to every square centimetre. Ordinary saliva, spat from the mouth, contains between ten million and 1,000 million bacteria in every cubic centimetre. Every time we defecate we lose 100,000 million microbes, but their numbers are soon made up again inside the body. This is the normal condition of the adult human animal. If we managed to live ‘germ-free’ of our own microbes all our lives, we would be at a grave disadvantage. Amongst other things, we would be less resistant to the foreign, and really vicious, microbes that we would encounter from time to time. We know this from careful experiments with germ-free laboratory animals. Our natural load of body microbes is therefore of great value to us, but now comes the catch. We have to pay a price for their good services, for even they can get out of hand when we become unduly stressed. Some of our diseases are caused, not by acquiring infections from others, but by a sudden eruption and ‘overcrowding’ of our own ‘normal’ microbes. The usual measures of public hygiene that assist in cutting down cross-infection from one person to another cannot help in such cases: we do not ‘catch’ the diseases; we carry the makings of them ourselves all the time. This is particularly true of many of the alimentary upsets so common in the emotionally stressed patient. If we have ‘stomach trouble’ we put it down to ‘something bad’ that we ate, but it is amazing what a healthy, happy person can devour and get away with. Probably nearly all the mild stomach and intestinal upsets we suffer from are due instead to emotional disturbances resulting from failures to adjust to the stresses and strains of modern living. To remind ourselves of this we have only to watch a natural history film of a flock of healthy vultures on the plains of Africa, gobbling down the putrid flesh of a decaying carcass, an event which is more likely to turn our own stomachs rather than those of the birds concerned.

A third alternative for the human individual in need of comfort is a more drastic one. Failing mental illness or endogenous illness, he can, with a little agitated carelessness, become dramatically accident-prone. If he trips over and breaks an ankle, he will soon be able to curse that he is ‘as helpless as a baby’, and in no time at all find himself helped and supported just like one. But surely accidents are accidental? Of course they can be, but nevertheless it is surprising how much people vary in their susceptibility to ‘accidental’ injuries. In a recent hospital investigation into the emotional backgrounds of disease patients, a number of accident patients were used as a control group, because it was assumed that they must be in their hospital beds ‘by accident’, in both senses of the word. Results showed that this was far from being the case, the accident victims proving to be, if anything, more emotionally disturbed than the disease patients.

Our stressed urban comfort-seeker, therefore, has several ways in which he can become suitably helpless and promote calming intimacies from those who attend him. There is a considerable advantage in being mildly ill from time to time, and if the advantage cannot be gained in one way, there is always another open. This method of increasing adult intimacies does, however, have its drawbacks. In all cases it involves the sick individual in the adoption of a submissive role. To obtain the comforting attention that his ailment provokes, he is forced to become genuinely inferior, either physically or mentally, to his comforters. This was not so with the young lovers, who went ‘soft’ on a reciprocal basis that did not lower their social status. Furthermore, the patient’s comfort-bath soon grows cold when he regains his health and strength, and the tender intimacies of those who have been caring for him cease abruptly. The reward was temporary, and the only way to prolong it is to become a chronic invalid who, as the saying goes, ‘enjoys bad health’. Apart from prolonging the inferior status, this also introduces a new danger, that of ailment escalation. The comforting fire that has been lit may get out of control and burn down the house. Even when used as a short-term measure, there is always the risk of long-term damage to the organism, as ulcer-sufferers know to their cost. But for many who find the tensions of modern living hard to bear, the risk is worth it. Temporary respite is better than no respite. If they are lucky, it gives them time to recharge their emotional batteries, and in so doing it can be said, in biological terms, to have considerable survival value in today’s crowded human communities.

Although much of the comfort obtained in this way is provided by the close companions of the patient, whose intimacy quotient becomes dramatically increased in most cases, the phenomenon of ‘going sick’ also provides the additional reward of obtaining the intimate attentions of a group of people who are comparative strangers – the members of the medical profession. Doctors are ‘licensed to touch’, and to do so with a degree of intimacy forbidden between most adults. Intuitively aware of this important element in their work, they know well the curative value of the ‘bedside manner’. The reassurance of the softly spoken word, the confident touch of the hand that takes the pulse, or taps the chest, or turns the head to examine eyes and mouth, these are the body-contact actions that, for some, are better than a hundred pills.

Sometimes a doctor will order the removal of a patient to a hospital bed on emotional grounds alone. For an individual whose source of stress lies solely in the outside world, such a move is unnecessary. By staying at home and taking to his bed, he escapes the tension that is damaging him. But if the tension lies in the home itself, there is no such escape. If the emotional pressures are coming from inside the family unit, then even his bedroom may not provide the necessary hiding-place, where he can curl up and find the comfort he needs so badly. Then the only solution is the hospital cot, and pray God for short visiting hours.

The medical solution for the adult intimacy-seeker is, as we have seen, a mixed blessing, and he would clearly do better to look elsewhere. If he is religious, he can perhaps enjoy an unmixed blessing from the hands of a priest, but, failing that, there are several other soothing contacts he can enjoy.

There is the whole lush world of body conditioning and beautifying to indulge in, where an army of professional touchers is waiting to rub, slap, stroke, smooth and pluck almost any part of your body you wish to indicate. This is like a kind of ‘healthy medicine’, the unpleasant stigma of sickness being replaced by a mood that is predominantly athletic or cosmetic. Or so it seems; but once again there is a powerful element of body-contact-for-contact’s-sake underlying all these activities. To be massaged from head to toe by a young masseuse is, for a man, almost as intimate a procedure as if he were to make love to her. In some ways it is more so, since by the time she has finished she will have made active body contact with nearly every part of his body, applying to each section of it in turn a rich variety of pressures, touches and tactile rhythms. Herein, we might dare to say, lies the rub, for the interaction, although it involves no direct sexual contact, is far too close for some men’s comfort.

Perhaps it would be more correct to say that it is too close for the comfort of Western society. Privately, the massaged body would no doubt enjoy itself greatly, but the public image of the massage parlour is, in our culture, not what it might be. One trend has been to reduce the imagined eroticism of the activity by introducing sexual segregation, so that men massage men and women massage women. Even this step has failed to give this intrinsically harmless form of soothing body contact a widespread acceptance in modern society. In removing the heterosexual contact, the way was inevitably paved for dark murmurings about the homosexual element. Only intensely athletic males can, with ease, overcome this slur. For the boxer or the wrestler there is no problem. Like the triumphant footballers who could embrace passionately in public without criticism, because of their obviously aggressive, masculine role, the prize-fighter can luxuriate on his massage table without any adverse comment. In theory, the rest of the adult population could follow his lead and do so without the slightest sexual involvement, regardless of the sexes involved, but in practice this plainly has not happened, and so, for the unmassaged majority, we must look elsewhere for adult body intimacies.

One way in which the problem has been solved is to multiply the numbers involved and to eliminate the atmosphere of an intimate ‘pair’. This is done in many gymnasiums and health farms, where groups of people gather to indulge in a variety of exercises which may include a great variety of body contacts without creating the flavour of two ‘consenting adults in private’. Another method is to replace the human masseur or masseuse with a strictly sexless machine that embraces them, not with loving arms, but with an impersonal canvas belt which then proceeds to be mechanically intimate with them.

A more commonly employed solution is to restrict the body contacts to the less private parts of the human body. Here we move into the totally acceptable world of hairdressers and beauty experts, pausing only to cast a last sympathetic glance at the massage world, where some practitioners have attempted a similar restriction by coyly advertising that they provide only ‘arm and leg massage’.

Since, in Western society, we all expose our heads to one another’s public gaze, the hairdresser is automatically excused the stigma of increased nudity during the course of his professional body contacts. What he or she handles, we all see. Nevertheless, touching the head, as we saw in an earlier chapter, is normally reserved for only the closest of intimates and particularly characterizes the amorous contacts of young lovers. Between adult strangers it is almost taboo, and so the hairdresser, in the guise of a cosmetician, can fill an important gap for a contact-starved adult. This does not mean that the cosmetic role is unimportant, but merely that there is more to hairdressing than meets the mirror’s eye.

Head-grooming, in the dual cosmetic/intimate role, has been with us for thousands of years. If we care to include our primate ancestors, we can safely put the figure at millions of years. The detailed and tender fingering that can be seen in any zoo monkey-house, as one monkey or ape works lovingly over the head-hair of its companion, leaves little doubt about the intimacy factor involved. Cleansing alone cannot account for the relaxed ecstasy of the primate groomee. And so it is with us, except that we, of course, cannot extend the interaction over our whole bodies like the furry monkey or ape. Where we cover our naked skins with clothing, we must rely on the deft, delicate touch of the tailor’s fingers as he adjusts our new garments to rekindle – faintly, very faintly – the long-lost sensation of intimate body-grooming.

For the monkey, hair-grooming by another is an act of social bonding, so it is not surprising to find that in earlier periods of our history the professional hairdresser was a rarity. Hair was groomed by close intimates, rather than by comparative strangers. In the days when we lived in small tribes this was, of course, inevitable, since everyone in the social group knew everyone else on a personal basis. Later, when the urban revolution came and we found ourselves increasingly surrounded by strangers, the tendency was to restrict hairdressing and its associated activities to interactions between close personal contacts. Much later, with the increasingly complex coiffure that appeared after the Middle Ages, more expert attention was needed by the high-ranking members of society, and the professional hairdresser began to make his mark. At first, where ladies were concerned, his intimate operations were confined to the privacy of his clients’ homes, but, gradually, more efficient public salons were opened and ladies of fashion began to flock to their doors. Even so, it was not until the second half of the last century that this became a common practice. Then the rush was on. In 1851 there were already 2,338 hairdressers operating in London, but fifty years later, in 1901, this figure had shot up to no less than 7,771, a dramatic rise that far outstripped the general increase in the city’s population. Part of the reason for this change was undoubtedly economic, but perhaps, too, there was another factor, for the Victorian female was severely restricted in the other ways in which she could make adult body contacts. The rules of conduct were so tightened during this period that the caress of the hairdresser’s hands must have provided a welcome intimacy in an era of such rigid restraint. Not only did more and more women venture forth, but they did so with increasing frequency. In the present century the pattern has spread out from the great cities and down to the smallest towns, involving almost the entire female population.

Aware that their modern clients craved more intimacy than the mere dressing of the hair could offer, this new army of professional touchers expanded the nature of their activities. Wherever there was exposed skin, they applied their delicate attentions. Manicures became popular. The ‘facial’ appeared on the scene. Mud-packs were applied, wrinkles smoothed and caressed, soft skin ‘toned-up’, the latest style of makeup demonstrated by a professional hand. ‘Beauty’, cried Vogue in 1923, ‘is a full-time job.’ There is no denying that the primary motive was visual, but the increased tactile intimacies involved in obtaining the desired visual effect were also undoubtedly of great importance. To visit a modern beauty parlour is nothing if not a touching experience.

By comparison, the modern male is poorly supplied with intimacies of this kind. Some men indulge in manicure and scalp massage, and a few still have their faces shaved occasionally, but for most the visit to the barber’s is a quick snip-snip and home again to wash the hair themselves. It is interesting that the barber does his best to increase the intimacy of this simple snipping by employing a ritual device. If you are a male, the next time you visit your barber, listen to the snipping sound of his scissors and you will find that for every hair-snip there are a number of ‘air-snips’, the scissors snapping together rapidly in mid-air before closing in for the next actual cut. There is no mechanical function to these air-snips, but they create the impression of great activity in the proximity of the scalp and thereby effectively increase the impression of ‘contact-complexity’.

For all that, the intimacy involved is a remarkably limited one, and it is surprising that today’s males should accept such restrictions. Perhaps with the return of longer male hair-styles we shall witness some changes. So far, it must be admitted, there is little sign of any general increase, rather the reverse. If anything, long male hair now means that there is a rapid decline even in the simple snip-snip, with the hair-washing still done largely in the home. Only in the more sophisticated urban centres is there any indication that the new hairstyles are leading to greater barbering activities, and it remains to be seen whether this development will spread. But the fashion is new and, if it survives, it will take some time for it to regain the widespread respectability it once had. There is an unjustified stigma of ‘effeminacy’ attached to it by the older males in the population, who have still not woken up to the fact that their close-cropped styles arose primarily as anti-louse devices and that to insist on all males retaining such styles in a post-lousy era is the height of irrationality. As long as this slur persists, there will be a reluctance on the part of many of the younger males to continue their trend to its logical conclusion and once again luxuriate in more elaborate tonsorial intimacies.

Just about the only ‘cosmetic’ intimacy that the modern male enjoys more than the female is the use of a public shoe-shine and, as a trade, even that has been losing ground of late. In most big cities now it has become little more than a curiosity, found only at one or two special points. Apart from the oral-genital contacts discussed earlier, this is probably the only time in a modern man’s life when he will see other human beings going on their knees before him to perform an act of body contact, and it is certainly the only time it will happen in public. (The shoe-shop attendant avoids the posture by sitting and leaning forward.) The kneeling posture of the shoe-shine creates such a striking impression of servility that this feature has perhaps been his undoing. In the past, a man could more easily accept a display of humility of this kind, so that the humble intimacy performed was doubly rewarding, but with a growing respect for human equality such an overt submissiveness becomes almost embarrassing. A symbolic kissing of our feet is too much for us, and the shoe-shine is fast becoming a vanishing breed. It is not that we have ceased to be responsive to humiliating services – that would be too congratulatory a thought – but rather that we no longer wish to be seen to be so responsive to them.

In this survey of professional touchers, we have so far covered the doctor, the nurse, the masseur, the gymnastics and health-and-beauty instructors, the hairdresser, the tailor, the manicurist, the beautician, the make-up specialist, the barber, the shoe-shine and the shoe-shop attendant. To this list we could add many other related occupations such as those of the wig-maker, the hatter, the chiropodist, the dentist, the surgeon, the gynaecologist and a whole variety of medical and semi-medical specialists. Of these, few warrant special comment. The dentist usually causes too much stress for his oral intimacies to provide any contact reward. The surgeon, whose body intimacies go so very much deeper than those of even the most passionate lover, also has little impact on us emotionally, thanks to the use of anaesthetics.

The actions that must take place during a gynaecologist’s examination of a patient are so similar, at a descriptive level, to the hand-to-genital contacts of a lover that here, too, paradoxically, there is no comfort in the intimacy. Embarrassment is reduced today by an intensely professional atmosphere, with both sides strictly on their guard against any misinterpretation of the anatomically sexual contact. Whereas holding a woman patient’s hand while taking her pulse may provide the secondary benefits of soothing bodily intimacy, touching her genitals is inevitably so intimate that the emotional barriers clamp down immediately and no such benefits are possible.

In the past, the special nature of genital examinations has caused endless trouble for well-meaning gynaecologists. Extraordinary anti-intimacy procedures have been insisted on. Three hundred years ago he was even, on occasion, required to crawl into the pregnant woman’s bedroom on his hands and knees to perform the examination, so that she would be unable to see the owner of the fingers which were to touch her so privately. At a later date, he was forced to work in a darkened room, or to deliver a baby by groping beneath the bedclothes. A seventeenth-century etching shows him sitting at the foot of the labour bed with the sheet tucked into his collar like a napkin, so that he is unable to see what his hands are doing, an anti-intimacy device that made cutting the umbilical cord a particularly hazardous operation.

Despite these bizarre precautions, the male midwife was forever under fire, and just over two hundred years ago a learned textbook on the theory and practice of midwifery was openly condemned as ‘the most bawdy, indecent and shameful book which the press ever brought into the world’. Needless to say, it was usually the men who complained and always the women who suffered. For centuries the sexual nature of the intimacies involved in assisting at the birth of a child stood in the way of efficient medical attention. Usually, properly qualified men were banished altogether from the labour bed, and the duties were performed by unskilled and often highly superstitious female midwives. (The word ‘midwife’ means simply ‘with-the-wife’, and makes no reference to the sex of the person concerned, although today we automatically think of it as indicating a woman, a fact that reflects this early ban on men.) As a result of this, an enormous number of women died in childbirth and many thousands of children succumbed at birth or in the first month of life. A large number of these cases were due entirely to the anti-intimacy rules that prevented skilled aid from being provided.

Here, then, is an instance of the sexual taboos on bodily contact creating a major social disaster and influencing the whole course of history. Year after year was to pass, and countless human miseries were to be heaped one on top of the other, before sanity prevailed and science was able to sweep away the ancient prejudices. Only by obeying the strictest possible code of conduct has the profession gradually been able to eliminate these early stupidities. Even so, the echoes of ancient fears can still be felt, and the modern gynaecological examination remains comfortless in the sphere of bodily contact.

There is only one area of social activity where sexual contacts do not suffer in this way, and that is the theatrical profession. Actors and actresses, including ballet dancers, opera singers and photographic models, all enjoy a professional life where they are widely licensed to touch one another in a sexual manner. In their performances they kiss and fondle, embrace and stroke, as the director demands. If it is in the script, it is within the social ‘law’, and the actor or actress can, during his or her working day, enjoy many bodily-contact comforts. For such an insecure profession this is undoubtedly a major benefit, although the extremes sometimes demanded can lead to difficulties. It is hard to pretend to make love to someone, even a professional colleague, time and time again, without the basic emotional reactions beginning to creep into the relationship, and this often happens, to the detriment of other intimate relationships in the ‘real’ world outside. If sexual intimacies are mimicked well enough, it is not easy to suppress the true biological responses which normally accompany them.

Another hazardous contact reward for the stars who dazzle us in the entertainment world is the physical acclaim of their more ardent followers. In public places they may find themselves hemmed in by eager fans, desperate to touch their idols. At a mild level this can provide a pleasant emotional reward, but occasionally it can lead to bruises and even injury. The powerful urge to touch the bodies of certain star musicians and singers – and even some of the more glamorous politicians – has recently reached staggering proportions. For the groupie girls who follow the more famous pop stars, there are literally no holds barred. Perhaps the most intimate example is that of the ‘plaster-casters’, groupies who persuade their pop idols to permit them to take plaster casts of their erect genitals, so that these effigies can be touched later at leisure, after their gods have departed.

In dealing with these interactions between pop stars and their fans, we have moved away from the situation in which touching is an inherent part of the professional activity itself. A masseur or a hairdresser has to touch his client or he cannot perform his task, but a singer does not have to touch or be touched in order to perform his songs. The fact that his special role in society makes him more touch-worthy is a secondary factor. A similar condition applies in other spheres, an obvious example being the police.

It is not the policeman’s job to touch people, but he is nevertheless licensed to do so with much greater freedom than the rest of us. He can lay hands on us in a way we would resent in a member of the general public. He can take a child’s hand in the street without causing comment. In a crowd he can push against us to keep us back, and we accept his contact role with equal ease. If he manhandles us when we are violent, again we are less likely to lash out wildly at him than we are at someone else who treats us in a similar manner. Only at the extremes of violence, where his own restraint breaks down and he begins to behave, under intense provocation, like a uniformed thug, do we fully disinhibit our reactions to him. Then, by contrast, our fury knows no bounds, as recent riot-scenes have testified all too often. It is as if, having given him a limited licence to touch us, we find abuse of that licence particularly unacceptable, as when a choir-master behaves improperly with a choirboy, or a schoolmaster with a pupil. The result is that, if driven to repeated breakdown in restraint, the police rapidly become dubbed as hated men and violently persecuted whenever angry crowds gather. Only in countries such as Great Britain, where the police are deliberately sent out into the streets completely unarmed, have there been any signs at all of slight restraints being applied on both sides during the worst civil rioting of recent years. It is as if the fact that both sides are forced to indulge in the greater body intimacy of hand-to-hand grappling, rather than the remoter savageries of overhead club- and stick-beating, or the totally remote brutalities of firearms, has some kind of restraining influence on the hostilities. There is nothing inherently less vicious about such encounters; even without weapons, eyes can be gouged out and genitals kicked in, but such cruelties are extremely rare. When compared with the cracked and bleeding skulls of other riot scenes, the hand-to-hand battles of London and other British cities begin to look almost civilized, and it is ironic that they do so by returning to the more intimate forms of pre-civilized, pre-weapon combat.

There is a well-known film-sequence cliché in which two tough and otherwise admirable men set about one another with their fists to settle some long-standing quarrel. A sophisticated movie audience knows full well that, if the two men both begin to lose, each beating the other into total physical exhaustion, they are about to witness the birth of a great new friendship. As the two bruised hulks sprawl weakly on the ground, sure enough, one pair of cracked and bleeding lips spits out a loose tooth, and grins admiringly at his equally beaten opponent. In no time at all, our heroes are helping one another up and crawling to the bar (there is usually one nearby) to share a reviving drink. After this we can be sure that nothing will ever separate them again, and that they will become indomitable partners in righting all wrongs, until, at the end of the film, one of them will die bravely saving the life of the other, breathing his last gasp cradled in the loving arms of the man whose face he once succeeded in beating to a pulp.

The moral of this highly coloured story is, of course, that a warm enemy is better than a cold friend, and it bears some investigation in terms of the body intimacies involved. It is almost as if any form of intimacy, even violent intimacy, providing it is performed on a sufficiently personal basis, can produce a bond of attachment between two antagonists. Needless to say, it is dangerous to generalize, and it can certainly not be offered as a general excuse for violence, but to ignore the phenomenon completely because it frightens us is equally unwise.

The difficulty is that impersonal violence has in recent times reached such a horrific scale that an almost total taboo has descended on the subject. For the sexually permissive society, violence, all violence, regardless of scale or context, has become the new philosophical restriction. In the broad context in which it is intended, the creed that we should ‘make love not war’ is unassailable, but the message underlying the ritualized film fight may perhaps lead us to consider a possible exception to this general rule. Clearly I am not thinking of anything as savage as the brawl I described above. I am imagining instead a situation in which certain people have so suppressed their aggressiveness that, even under intense provocation, they will ‘not so much as lay a finger on’ their partners’ bodies. To take non-violence to such an extreme in every instance can create a new form of anti-intimacy. Let me give an example.

If, unavoidably, two individuals have grown cold towards one another, for whatever reason, the relationship can finally freeze to death in an atmosphere of hypocritical restraint. The thin hard smile of inhibited anger can cut sharp as any knife. Sometimes, under such conditions, an explosion into a flaming row, accompanied with mild but nevertheless aggressive interaction, can clear the air like a long-awaited thunderstorm, and release the damaging tension. Perhaps for the first time in months, a bickering couple actually take one another in their arms and, even though it is to shake the partner violently by the shoulders rather than to embrace lovingly, the result is the feel of the first truly meant body contact in ages. It is, of course, a desperate situation to have arrived at, when to touch at all means to touch in this hostile way, and it may very well fail. But just occasionally it may succeed, and to ignore this fact because it is out of step with the current cultural mood is to disregard another facet of the powerful emotional impact that body intimacy can have on the bonds of attachment between two human beings.

A related pattern of behaviour is the rough-and-tumble play of children, or the ‘horseplay’ or ‘rough-housing’ that can sometimes be observed between friendly adults. Again, the body contacts involved make their emotional impact, and they do so because they are accompanied by the unspoken message, ‘Even though I am being aggressive, you can see that I am not really aggressive.’ The message is a subtle one, however, and play-fighting at any age can become a delicately balanced interaction. The man who playfully slaps a companion on the back can easily reverse the signal, so that it becomes, ‘Even though I am pretending to be only playfully aggressive, you can tell by the way I am doing it that I am not.’ He uses the slap because it has become formalized as an accepted play-fighting pattern, but by his accompanying actions and by the hardness of the slap it becomes instantly apparent to his companion that he has twisted the message back to front.

A similar complexity exists in the case of the bickering couple mentioned above. If, under extreme provocation, the action is no more than a mild slap on the cheek, or the shaking of the partner’s shoulders, then the message reads, ‘Although you have made me want to kick your teeth in, this is all I am doing to you.’ But if the provocation is less than extreme, then even the most moderate of aggressive contacts transmits a signal that is merely surly and unpleasant.

The subtle dangers of play-fighting can sometimes be observed very clearly when two boys start idly wrestling on a street-corner. At first they both obey the conventions of playful aggression. Each body-push and arm-lock is performed with exactly the right intensity – strong enough to make it forceful, but not so strong that it becomes truly violent. If this delicate balance is accidentally upset and one of them is hurt, the mood changes. Now he retaliates more powerfully and, if the situation is badly handled, a real fight can slowly grow out of the playful one. The changes that signal this are difficult to analyse, because even the playful wrestling may look real enough. Usually the tell-tale signs begin to show in the facial expressions, which, instead of being relaxed and smiling, or exaggeratedly mock-savage, become hard and set, often with accompanying changes in pallor and flushing.

Where professional wrestlers are concerned, a mimic of this changeover can be seen. The ‘villain’ deliberately fouls the ‘hero’, who then becomes expansively outraged, protesting to the referee and demanding sympathy from the crowd. Lunging wildly at his opponent, he appears to switch from the conventional combat techniques to uncontrolled violence, returning foul for foul, and the audience roars its approval. But here, even the ‘uncontrolled’ aggression is itself formalized, and the audience, joining in the game, knows this perfectly well. Should one wrestler genuinely hurt a rival, the bout is immediately called off and, instead of ‘savage reprisals’, ill-concealed concern is shown on all sides.

Leaving this dangerous subject, we can turn now to the safer and more tender intimacies of the dance-floor. As a sphere of activity in which there are professionals who are licensed to touch, dancing offers limited possibilities. True, the adult who is seeking some form of body contact can achieve it by using the services of a dancing instructor, and a male dancer can, in certain localities, visit a dance-hall which supplies professional dancing partners at a set fee per dance, but the world of social dancing is today largely one for the amateur. At parties, discotheques, dance-halls and ballrooms, adults who are strangers to one another can come together and move around the room in an intimate frontal embrace. Individuals who are already friendly can also use the situation to escalate a non-touching relationship into a touching one. The special role that social dancing plays in our society is that it permits, in its special context, a sudden and dramatic increase in body intimacy in a way that would be impossible elsewhere. If the same full frontal embrace were performed between strangers, or partial strangers, outside the context of the dance floor, the impact would be entirely different. Dancing, so to speak, devalues the significance of the embrace, lowering its threshold to a point where it can lightly be indulged in without fear of rebuff. Having permitted it to occur, it then gives a chance for it to work its powerful magic. If the magic fails to work, the formalities of the situation also permit retreat without ignominy.

Like so many other aspects of body intimacy, dancing has a long history stretching back into our animal past. In behaviour terms, its basic ingredient is the repeated intention movement. If we look at the dancing displays of various birds, we find that the rhythmic movements they perform are mostly made up of movements that start to go one way, then stop and go another, then stop again and repeat the first action, and so on. Turning from side to side, twisting back and forth, or bobbing up and down, the bird displays vigorously in front of its mate. It is in a state of conflict, one urge pulling it forward and another holding it back. During the course of evolution, the rhythm of these intention movements becomes fixed and the display becomes a ritual. The form the ritual takes varies from species to species and in each case becomes characteristic of their particular sexual preliminaries.

Most of our dance movements have originated in the same way, but in us they have not evolved into a fixed form. Instead, they have been culturally developed and are highly variable. Many of the actions of human dancers are no more than intention movements of going somewhere, only instead of carrying the action through, we check it, move back or round, and start again. In earlier centuries, many dances were like little parades, with the couple demurely holding hands and stepping round the floor, pausing every so often, turning round, and then going on again, to the rhythm of the music. Because the pattern was essentially one of going on a journey, it also frequently included mock-greetings towards the partner, with formal bowings and curtsyings, as though the two dancers had just met. In both folk-dancing and the courtly ballrooms, there was typically an intricate weaving round and round and in and out of other pairs on the floor, or arena. The body intimacies involved in such performances were so strictly limited that they gave rise to no sexual problems. They simply permitted a general social intermingling. The fact that the leading of the female by the male, around and around the floor, was so formalized, stopped any awkward questions about where he was really supposed to be leading her, or for what purpose.

The situation changed dramatically at the beginning of the last century, as a new dance craze swept across Europe. The waltz had arrived. For the first time the dancing couple embraced as they moved, a public intimacy that immediately created widespread scandal and concern. Such a major advance required a subterfuge, and it is one we have met before. When discussing the first way in which a simple hand-to-hand contact can be effected, I mentioned that a much-used trick is the intimacy-disguised-as-aid. The hand that reaches out does so ostensibly to support or steady the other person, to guide them or to prevent them from falling. In this way it can cross the vital threshold of making body contact without causing alarm. So it was with the waltz. At the very beginning of its history it was an incredibly rapid and athletic dance, so that the partners were forced to clutch at one another’s bodies to prevent themselves from spinning apart. This was the ‘supporting’ device and, once it had enabled the waltz to gain an entrance into the ballroom, it was then only a matter of slowing down the speed of the performance to convert these actions of mutual physical aid into the more tender intimacies of a true frontal embrace.

The older generation, who had not known such delights, were outraged. The waltz, which today seems quaintly old-fashioned, was, in its early years, described as ‘polluting’ and ‘the most degenerate dance that the last or present century can see’. The early Victorian author of The Ladies’ Pocket-Book of Etiquette devoted ten pages to an all-out attack on this abominable new public intimacy. Among her comments: ‘Ask any mother … can she consent to commit her daughter promiscuously to the arms of each waltzer? Ask the lover … could he endure the sight of the adopted of his heart … reclining in the arms of another? … Ask the husband … will you suffer your wife to be half-embraced by every puppy who turns on his heel or his toe?’ The attacks persisted and, less than a hundred years ago, an American dancing-master in Philadelphia pronounced the waltz immoral because it involved the hugging of a lady by a gentleman she might not previously have met. But the battle was gradually lost, and the wicked waltz reigned supreme, bringing in its wake a whole variety of dances involving the full frontal embrace. These, in their turn, caused further scandalized mutterings.

The importation of the tango from South America in 1912 was again greeted with outrage. Because this dance included ‘suggestive lateral movement of the hips’, which reminded the hawk-eyed guardians of morals of the actions of copulation, it was instantly dubbed as depraved.

No sooner was that battle lost than the Jazz Age burst upon the scene, and the frantic dancing-teachers of the 1920s called urgent meetings to discuss this new threat to their respectability. They issued strong official protests about this new craze, pointing out that all the jazz dances had originated in Negro brothels.

Perhaps the most extraordinary attack on jazz dancing came in a newspaper report which claimed that ‘The dance, and the music, with its abominable rhythm and copulative beat, was imported from Central Africa by a gang of Bolshevists in America, their aim being to strike at Christian civilization throughout the world.’ Perhaps this puts into true perspective the recent claims that the current wave of student revolt, dropping-out and drug-taking is also a ‘Red plot’.

Since its early days, jazz has given birth to several lusty offspring, and each in turn has caused the inevitable raised eyebrows as the dancers have taken to the floor with more and more variations of the public embrace. In the ’forties it was jitterbugging and in the ’fifties rock-and-roll, but then something strange happened. For some reason that it is perhaps still too early to understand, the couples separated. With the ’sixties, the dancing embrace went into a rapid decline. Now only the older, more staid couples clung to one another as they rotated around the floor. The younger dancers pulled apart from one another and danced more or less on the spot where they stood. It began with the twist and before long involved a confusingly large number of alternatives such as the hitch-hiker, the shake, the monkey and the frug. More and more styles were specified until eventually, as the decade drew to a close, the situation became so confused that they all merged into one more or less nameless amalgam, and became simply the dance that was danced to ‘pop’. All had the same important feature – no touching. Presumably the significance of this change lies in the marked increase in sexual permissiveness. If young Victorian couples were not allowed to enjoy extensive private intimacies, then the embrace of the waltz had great meaning for them, but if matters are freer today, then who cares about a specially ‘licensed’ context for a mere standing embrace? It is as if the young dancers of today are publicly stating, ‘We don’t need it, we have the real thing.’

This brings us to the end of this brief survey of the way in which we, as adults, find specialized methods of indulging in bodily intimacy. All through the chapter, from doctors to dancers, there has always been something other than pure contact involved. At no point has there been touching merely for touching’s sake. In every case there has been some excuse that provides us with a licence to touch or be touched. And yet, frequently, there is the distinct impression that it is the contact that is more important than the official activity. Perhaps one day, as the stresses of modern living increase, we shall see the appearance of an undisguised professional toucher, who will sell embraces like beads. Or perhaps to buy his wares will always be too great an admission of failure on our part, a failure to achieve the longed-for intimacies with a family unit of our own.

Whatever happens, we can always fall back on that perpetual substitute for body intimacy, namely verbal intimacy. Instead of exchanging embraces we can exchange comforting words. We can smile and talk about the weather. It is a poor substitute where emotional interchanges are concerned, but it is better than total emotional isolation. And if we still yearn after a more direct form of contact, there are other alternatives open to us: we can touch some non-human animal, or an inanimate object, using it as a stand-in for the human body we would really like to approach, or, if there is no other solution, we can always touch ourselves. The ways in which we employ animals, objects and our own bodies as substitutes for human intimates are discussed in the next three chapters.
