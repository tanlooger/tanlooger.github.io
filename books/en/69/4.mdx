title: 4 Social Intimacy
---




TO STUDY HUMAN sexual intimacy is to witness the rebirth of lavish bodily contact between adults, replacing the lost intimacies of infancy. To study human social intimacy is, by contrast, to observe the restraint of cautious, inhibited contact, as the conflicting demands of closeness and privacy, of dependence and independence, do battle inside our brains.

We all feel overcrowded from time to time, and over-exposed to the prying eyes and minds of others. The monkish idea of shutting ourselves away from it all becomes appealing. But for most of us a few hours will do, and the idea of lifelong monastic solitude is appalling. For man is a social animal, and the ordinary healthy human being finds prolonged isolation a severe punishment. Short of physical torture or death, solitary confinement is the worst agony that can be inflicted on a prisoner. He is driven eventually, in near-madness, to talk into his lavatory pan so that he can enjoy the echo of his voice coming back to him. It is the nearest thing to a social response he can get.

A shy single person living in a big city can find him- or herself in almost the same situation. For such people, if they have left the intimacies of home behind and are now existing by themselves in a small room or apartment, the loneliness can soon become intolerable. Too timid to make friends, they may ultimately prefer death by suicide to prolonged lack of close human contact. Such is the basic need for intimacy. For intimacy breeds understanding, and most of us, unlike the solitary monk, do want to be understood, at least by a few people.

It is not a question of being understood rationally or intellectually. It is a matter of being understood emotionally, and in that respect a single intimate body contact will do more than all the beautiful words in the dictionary. The ability that physical feelings have to transmit emotional feelings is truly astonishing. Perhaps it is their strength that is also their weakness. In tracing the sequence of intimacies that occur through life, from birth to death, we saw the way in which the two phases of massive body contact were also the two phases of powerful social bonding, first between parent and child and second between lovers. All the indications are that it is impossible to be lavish and uninhibited with one’s body-to-body contacts and not become strongly bonded with the object of one’s attentions. An intuitive understanding of this is perhaps what inhibits us so strongly from indulging in the pure pleasure of more widespread bodily intimacies. It is not enough to say that it is unconventional to hug and embrace one’s business colleagues, for example. That does not explain how the convention of ‘keeping oneself to oneself’ or ‘keeping one’s distance’ arose in the first place. We have to look deeper than that to understand the extraordinary lengths we go to to avoid touching one another in ordinary day-to-day affairs outside the close family circle.

Part of the answer has to do with the great overcrowding we experience in our modern urban communities. We encounter so many people in streets and buildings every day that we simply cannot embark on intimacies with them, or all social organization would come to a halt. Ironically this over-crowding situation has two completely incompatible effects on us. On the one hand it stresses us and makes us feel tense and insecure, and on the other hand it makes us cut down on the very exchanges of intimacies which would relieve this stress and tension.

Another part of the answer has to do with sex. It is not merely that we cannot afford the time or energy to start setting up the endless social bonds that would result from widespread indulgence in extensive body intimacies. There is also the problem that, between adults, body intimacy spells sex. This is an unhappy confusion, but it is not hard to see how it has arisen. Since copulation, short of artificial insemination, is impossible without body intimacy, it has become in some respects synonymous with it. To indulge in the mating act, even the most ‘untouchable’ adult has to touch and be touched. At almost all other times he can avoid it if he wishes to, but then he cannot. Some Victorians went as far as they could to reduce contact by wearing nightgowns with small slits in the front, but even they had to make contact to the extent of inserting a penis into a vagina if they were to populate their world with children. And so it came to be that, in the year 1889, the expression ‘to be intimate’ became a euphemism for having sexual intercourse. During the present century it has become increasingly difficult for any adult, of either sex and with either sex, to indulge in intimate body contact without giving the impression that there is a sexual element involved in what is taking place.

It would be wrong to give the idea that this is an entirely new trend. The problem, of course, has always been there, and adult intimacies have always been curtailed to some extent to avoid sexual implications. But one gets a distinct impression that the situation has tightened up more in recent years. We no longer seem to be quite so free at falling on one another’s necks in joy, or weeping copiously in one another’s arms. The basic urge to touch one another remains, however, and it is intriguing to study how we go about this in our day-to-day affairs outside the bosom of the family.

The answer is that we formalize it. We take the uninhibited intimacies of infancy and we reduce them to fragments. Each fragment becomes stylized and rigidified until it fits into a neat category. We set up rules of etiquette (a word taken from the French and meaning, literally, a label) and we train the members of our cultures to abide by them. No training is necessary where an embrace is concerned. This, as we have seen, is an inborn biological act that we share with all our primate relatives. But an embrace contains many elements, and which particular fragment we are to use at which particular social moment, and in what rigidly stylized form, is something that our genetical make-up cannot help us with. For the animal, there is either behaviour or no behaviour, but for us there is either behaviour or misbehaviour, good behaviour or bad behaviour, and the rules are complex. This does not mean, however, that we cannot study them biologically. No matter how culturally determined they may be, or how culturally variable, we can still understand them better if we view them as pieces of primate behaviour. This is because we can nearly always trace them back to their biological origins.

Before surveying the whole scene, let me give a single detailed example to illustrate what I mean. I will use an action that does not appear to have received much attention in the past, namely the pat on the back. You may think that this is too trivial a piece of behaviour to be of much interest, but it is dangerous to dismiss small actions in this way. Every twitch, every scratch, every stroke and every pat has the potential of changing a person’s whole life, or even a nation’s. The warm caress that was withheld at the vital moment when it was desperately needed can easily be the act, or rather the non-act, that finally destroys a relationship. The simple failure to return a smile, between two great rulers, can in the same way lead to war and destruction. So it is unwise to sneer at a ‘mere’ pat on the back. These little actions are the stuff that emotional life is made of.

If you have ever had a close personal relationship with a chimpanzee, you will know that back-patting is not a uniquely human activity. If your ape is particularly glad to see you, he is likely to come up, embrace you, press his lips warmly and wetly to the side of your neck, and then start rhythmically patting you on the back with his hands. It is a strange sensation, because in one way it is so human and yet in another it is subtly different. The kiss is not quite like a human kiss. I can best describe it as being more of a soft-open-mouth-press. And the patting is both lighter and faster than human back-patting, with the two ape hands alternating rhythmically. Nevertheless, the actions of embracing, kissing and patting are basically the same in the two species, and the social signals they transmit appear to be identical. We can therefore start out with a reasonable guess that back-patting is a biological feature of the human animal.

I have already, in the first chapter, explained the probable origin of the activity, as a repeated intention movement of clinging that says, ‘I will cling to you like this if necessary, but at the moment it is not, so relax, all is well.’ In infancy we only get patted as an embellishment of the embrace, but later on the friendly pat may be executed by itself, without any embracing. The patter’s arm simply reaches out towards the companion and contact is made with the hand alone. Already, with this change, the process of formalization has started to take place. Seeing only an embraceless pat would make it impossible to guess its true origin. Another change occurs at the same time: the area of the body patted becomes less restricted. A baby is patted almost exclusively on the back, but an older child is patted almost anywhere, not only on the back but also on the shoulder, the arm, the hand, the cheek, the top of the head, the back of the head, the stomach, the buttocks, the thighs, the knees and the legs. The message of the pat also becomes extended. The comforting signal ‘all is well’ becomes the congratulatory signal ‘all is very well’ or ‘you have done well’. Since the brain that has done well is housed inside the skull, it is natural that the pat on the head should be the action that comes to typify the congratulatory message. In fact, this particular form of the action becomes so strongly associated with childhood congratulation that it has to be abandoned later on when patting occurs between adults, because it then acquires the flavour of condescension.

Other changes also occur as we move from the context adult-pats-child to adult-pats-adult. In addition to the head, certain other areas now become taboo. Patting on the back, shoulder and arm is still unhampered, but patting the back of the hand, the cheek, the knee or the thigh begins to acquire a slightly sexual flavour, and patting on the buttocks a strongly sexual flavour. The situation is highly variable, however, and there are many exceptions to this rule. Handback-patting and thigh-patting between two women, for example, may occur without any hint of sexuality being involved. Also it is possible, by comic over-exaggeration, to pat almost any part of the body without causing offence. The patter then makes joking remarks, as he pats his victim on the head or cheek, such as ‘there, there, little man’, indicating that the contact he is making is not sexual but mock-parental, and is not to be taken seriously. There is an element of offensiveness involved, of course, but it has nothing to do with the breaking of sexual taboos on touching certain areas in certain ways.

To complicate matters further, there is an intriguing exception to this last exception. It works like this. One adult, say a male, wishes to make sexual body contact with another, say a female. He knows she will not accept a direct, undisguised contact, which she would find distasteful. He knows, in fact, that she finds him sexually unattractive in general, but his urge to touch her is strong enough to ignore the disencouraging signals she transmits to him. His strategy therefore becomes one of pretending to behave like a mock-parent. He makes a great joke of patting her on the knee and calling her a funny little girl. He hopes that she will accept the contact as a joke action, even though the true reward he is getting is sexual. Unhappily for him he is not usually good enough at concealing other sexual signals, especially from his facial expressions, and the girl in question can normally see through the device and respond in an appropriately negative way.

The least sexually loaded patting action is the primary pat on the back. This somehow manages to retain its original quality and may often be observed between complete strangers, in contexts of either condolence or congratulation. Two specific situations which illustrate this are the road accident and the sportsman’s moment of triumph. Following a road accident, if one of those involved is sitting slumped by the roadside in a state of numbed shock, he will soon be approached closely by one of the helpers who arrive on the scene. Typically, the helper will peer closely at the shocked person and ask some quite nonsensical question, such as ‘Are you all right?’, when clearly he is not. Almost immediately the helper realizes how meaningless his words are in such a situation, and reverts instead to the more powerful and basic communication pattern of direct body contact. The most likely form that this contact will take is a comforting, gentle patting on the back of the victim. The same response can be observed, but with much more vigour, when a sportsman has just achieved some sort of athletic triumph. As he returns cheerfully from the field or arena, his fans will compete with one another to get close enough to pat him warmly on the back as he passes by.

We have already come a long way from the primary situation of the mother lovingly patting her tiny baby, but there is still further to go, for amongst adults the action of patting has extended its range even beyond the tactile. The basic touch signal has, in two important contexts, become a sound signal and a visual signal. Both human clapping, when an audience applauds a performer, and human waving, during greetings and farewells, have been derived from the primary patting action. Let us take clapping first.

For years I was puzzled by the widespread use of hand-clapping as a method of rewarding a performer. The sharp slapping of one hand against another seemed an almost aggressive action, as did the harsh sound it produced. Yet clearly it was the exact opposite of aggressive in its effect on the happy performer. For centuries, actors have craved the applause of a sea of clapping hands, and have devised many a ‘trap to catch a clap’, thereby giving the English language its word ‘clap-trap’.

To understand the potent reward of hand-clapping, we must search for its origins in childhood. Careful studies of infants in the second half of the first year of life reveal that at this age a hand-clap may often be given as part of the greeting towards the mother, when she returns to her baby after a brief absence. The action may be performed either just before, or instead of, reaching out with its arms towards the mother. It appears at about the same time as the act of holding on to the mother with the arms. It is as if the baby, seeing the mother approaching, makes a movement in which the arms are brought out and round as if to hold her. But her body is not there yet to be held, and so the arms continue in the arc of embracing until the hands meet with a clap. At this stage the clap is performed, as it were, from the arm, not from the wrist as in the adult version of hand-clapping.

Detailed observations have indicated that this occurs where there is no evidence of the mother’s having taught a clapping response previously. The baby clap, in other words, can best be interpreted as the audible culmination of a vacuum-embracing of the mother. The rhythmically repeated clapping-from-the-wrist that develops later can then be seen clearly as a kind of vacuum-patting added to the vacuumembrace. When we applaud a performer, we are, in effect, patting him on the back from a distance. It is inconvenient or impossible for us to all rush up and actually make physical contact with him, giving him a real pat to show our approval, so instead we stay in our seats and repeatedly pat him in vacuo. If you test this by clapping your hands as though you were applauding, you will find that you do not bring both hands together with equal force. One tends to take the role of the performer’s back and the other does the vigorous vacuum-back-patting on it. It is true that both hands move, but one makes a much stronger action than the other. In nine people out of ten it is the right hand, with the palm facing half-downwards, that takes the patting role, and the left hand, with the palm facing half-upwards, that takes the role of the back to be patted.

Occasionally one gets an unexpected glimpse, even in the adult world, of the basic relationship that exists between the primary embrace and the action of hand-clapping. When the first Russian cosmonaut returned in triumph to Moscow and stood in Red Square with the Russian leaders, a vast crowd filed past paying homage, reaching up and clapping their hands to him as they went by. A film of the event clearly shows one man in the crowd so overcome with emotion that he keeps on interrupting his prolonged hand-clapping with vacuum embraces. He claps his outstretched hands, embraces the air in front of him and hugs it to him, then reaches out, claps again and embraces again. When the power of the emotion breaks down the formalization of the conventional pattern in this way, it provides us with an eloquent confirmation of the origins of the adult act.

Russia happens to provide us with another interesting variation in hand-clapping. In that country it is usual for the performers to clap the audience as the audience claps them. This does not mean, as has sometimes been cynically suggested, that Russian performers are so narcissistic that they even applaud their own performances. They are simply returning the audience’s formalized embrace, as they would do if they met them body to body. In the West we lack this convention, although a variant of it can sometimes be seen in the wide-stretched arms of the performers seeking applause at the end of an act. Circus performers and acrobats are particularly prone to adopt this posture. At the completion of a difficult stunt, they stand proudly poised, face the audience, and fling their arms out wide. The audience immediately breaks into ringing applause. The opening of the arms in this way is an example of an intention movement of embracing. The arms are positioned ready to embrace the audience, but do not go on to consummate the act in vacuo. Some cabaret singers who specialize in highly emotional songs use much the same action whilst actually singing, arousing emotion in the audience by offering them an imploring invitation to embrace as an accompaniment to the imploring words of the song.

Hand-clapping is also used occasionally as an act of summoning a servant. In the harem fantasy, it is the signal that says ‘bring on the dancing girls’. In these cases the clapping is not the typical fast, rhythmically repeated action of the applause pattern, but simply one or two hard slaps of one hand against the other. In this respect it is much more like the infant clapping that was performed as a greeting to the mother. The message is also similar. The infant’s request, ‘come closer’, to the mother, becomes the adult’s demand for the same thing from the servant.

I said earlier that the basic touch signal of patting has been extended both as a sound signal, which we have been examining, and as a visual signal, in the form of waving. Like clapping, waving is usually taken for granted, but it, too, has some unexpected elements, and it is worth analysing in detail.

To start with, it seems obvious that we wave when greeting or saying goodbye because, from a distance, it makes us more conspicuous. This is true, but it is not the whole answer. If you watch people who are really desperate to make themselves conspicuous, say when hailing a taxi, or when trying to make visual contact with a person in a crowd who has not yet spotted them, they do not wave in the usual, conventional manner. Instead, they raise one arm stiffly, straight up, and start swinging it from side to side, moving it from the shoulder. Under even greater pressure, they may raise and wave both arms in this way at the same time. This is the action that makes for maximum conspicuousness at a distance. It is not, however, the way we wave to one another when we are already in visual contact. If we are waving goodbye to someone, or if we are waving a greeting to someone who has already seen us but is still out of reach, we do not normally wave our arms. We raise the arm, but what we wave is the hand. We do it in one of three ways. One is to wave it up and down, with the fingers pointing away from us. When the hand is in the up position, the palm faces outwards; when in the down position, the palm faces downwards. Here again is the ubiquitous patting action. The greeting arm reaches out to embrace and pat, but, as with the clapping, the intervening distance forces us to perform the action in vacuo. The difference is that whereas in hand-clapping the long-distance embrace-and-pat is elaborated into a sound signal, here it is modified into a visual signal. The arm goes upward instead of forward, as it would in a true contact embrace, because this increases the visibility of the action. Otherwise there is little difference.

A second form of hand-waving reveals a further modification towards visibility. Instead of moving the hand up and down, it is waved from side to side, with the palm kept in the out-facing position. The speed is much the same, but the action is now one step further removed from the primary patting motion. It is significant that this form of waving is favoured more by adults than by children, who seem to prefer the primitive up-and-down version.

The third type of hand-wave is one that will not be familiar to most Western readers. I have myself observed it only in Italy, but apparently it also occurs in Spain, China, India, Pakistan, Burma, Malaysia, East Africa, Nigeria, and amongst gypsies. (This is, to say the least of it, a most curious distribution, for which I can as yet find no explanation.) It is reminiscent of a hand-beckoning action, but one only has to see it performed as a goodbye signal to realize that this is not what it is. Like the first form of hand-waving I mentioned, it is an up-and-down action, but this time the hand starts out palm uppermost (as in a begging posture) and is then moved repeatedly upwards towards the body of the waver. Again, it is basically a patting movement, and in true back-patting one often sees the hand adopt this position, with the fingers pointing upwards on the back, when the embracing arm has the elbow in a low position.

Two rather specialized waves are related to this last one. They are the Papal wave and the British royal wave. In both cases, for some reason, they are performed neither from the shoulder, as in the conspicuous arm-wave, nor from the wrist, as in the usual patting-wave. Instead they are done from the elbow. The Pope normally uses both arms at once and brings his hands and forearms slowly, rhythmically and repeatedly towards himself, palms uppermost, making a series of embracing intention movements. But it is not as simple as that, because his arms do not bend directly towards his chest. He does not hug the crowd to his bosom. Instead, the arc the arms perform is half-inward and half-upward, as though his action is a compromise, embracing the crowds partly towards himself and partly towards the heavens above, where one day they presumably all hope to be welcomed.

The British royal wave is also typically stiff from the elbow, but is normally one-handed and with the fingers pointing straight up. The palm faces inwards towards the royal body, emphasizing the embracing nature of the action, and the forearm is slowly and rhythmically rotated, with the emphasis on the inward part of the rotation. In this way the Queen, in a highly stylized manner, embraces her subjects and reassures them with a rather formal pat on the back.

As in the case of clapping, one is sometimes lucky enough to see the formality of waving break down under emotional pressure in a revealing way, laying bare its basic origins. A specific instance of greeting will illustrate this. At a small airport where I was making observations of waving behaviour, there is a balcony from which friends and relatives can watch the new arrivals descend from the incoming aircraft and walk across the tarmac to the customs entrance. This entrance is just beneath the balcony, so that although the new arrivals cannot touch the excited figures waving frantically to them from above, they do come very close before finally disappearing into the airport building. This, then, is the setting, and the action usually takes place as follows. After the aircraft doors open and the passengers start piling out, there is a great deal of distant eye-scanning from both the arrivals and the greeters. If one makes eye contact before the other, he normally starts vigorous arm-waving, moving the arm from the shoulder in the maximum-conspicuousness manner. After mutual eye contact has been made, then both sides tend to adopt the arm-raised hand-wave action. This goes on for some time, but it is a long walk to the building and after a while they usually break off. Their waving and smiling urges have become temporarily exhausted (like the person being photographed who, as time passes, finds it hard to maintain a natural smile for the lens-fiddling cameraman), but they do not wish to appear ‘ungreetful’, so both sides now take a sudden interest in other aspects of the airport scene. The new arrival glances round to survey the landscape of the airfield, or rearranges that suddenly awkward piece of hand-luggage that is mysteriously slipping from his grip. The greeters for their part start to exchange comments about the appearance of the new arrival. Then, as the latter comes nearer and his facial details can be made out more clearly, both sides start up the vigorous hand-waving and smiling again until the arrivals have disappeared into the building below. Half an hour later, with customs inspection over, the first body contact is made, with handshakes, embraces, pattings, hugs and kisses.

This is the basic story. Naturally, there are many minor variations, and on one occasion the pattern was exceeded in a most revealing way. A man was returning to the bosom of his family after a long spell abroad. From the moment he stepped off the aircraft both he and his group of family greeters exploded into an orgy of arm- and hand-waving. As he reached the building and saw the details of their faces clearly above him, he found the convention of hand-waving inadequate for his emotional needs. With tears in his eyes and his mouth shaping unheard words of love, he had to do something with his arm that would better express the enormous intensity of his feelings at being reunited with his family. At this moment, as I watched, I saw his hand actions change. The ordinary waving movements ceased and were replaced by a perfect miming of a passionate series of back-pattings. The arm was now held out towards the family group, rather than raised upward, which foreshortened it and reduced its conspicuousness. The hand curled round sideways and made vigorous, rapid patting actions in mid-air. The power of his emotions was so strong that all the secondary, conventionalized modifications of the primary embrace-and-pat actions, which help to improve the signal quality of this pattern from a distance by making it more clearly visible, were abandoned in the heat of the moment, and the original primary behaviour was once again laid bare.

The intensity of this encounter was confirmed by the tactile greeting behaviour that followed the customs interlude. When the man emerged into the body of the airport, he was embraced, hugged, kissed and patted with such vigour by all fourteen members of his family that, by the time they had finished, he was emotionally exhausted, his face flooded with tears, his body shaking. At one point a woman who appeared to be his mother augmented her embrace with vigorous face-kneading, taking both the man’s cheeks in her hands and grappling with them as though she were in her kitchen kneading soft dough. While this was going on, the man’s hands were embracing her and patting her back at high intensity. However, after about the tenth passionate greeting, it seemed as if the emotional exhaustion of the occasion was beginning to tell on him. As this occurred, his patting actions changed significantly. Once again, a signal convention was breaking down under emotional pressure, and once again the origins of a formalized pattern were being laid bare. Whereas, before, the waving had reverted to vacuum-air-patting, this time it went one stage further back to its original source. The repeated patting gave way to brief, repeated clinging actions. Each pat became a tightening of the hand contact, a sort of clinging squeeze, that was repeatedly relaxed and then tightened again. Here, without doubt, was the original clinging intention movement. This was the ‘ancestral’ pattern, the one from which all the others had descended by a process of signal specialization: to a tactile signal by modification to on-off patting, to a sound signal by using the other palm as the more noisily patted object in the act of hand-clapping, and to a visual signal by patting in mid-air with a raised arm in the act of hand-waving. Such are the ramifications that occur with our so-called ‘trivial’ acts of human intimacy.

In following this one small human-contact action through all its various developments, I have tried to show how it is possible to see old familiar activities in a new light. The need that we, as adults, have to make body contact with one another is basic and powerful, but, as we have seen, it is rarely fully expressed. Instead, it appears in fragmented, modified or disguised forms in many of the signs, gestures and signals we make to one another in our daily lives. Often the true meaning of the actions is hidden from us and we have to trace them back to their origins to understand them fully. In the examples I have just been describing, the primary contact action frequently became remote, operating at a distance, but there are also many ways in which we do still make actual body contact with one another, and it is interesting to survey these and see what forms they take. To do this it will help to go back for a moment to the primary embrace itself. This is not commonly seen today between adults in public, but it still does occur from time to time and it is worth studying the situations in which it appears.

The full embrace. If we make careful observations of as many full embraces as possible, then it soon becomes clear that between adults this action falls into three distinct categories. The biggest group, as we might expect, consists of amorous contact between lovers. This accounts for about two-thirds of all public embraces today. The remaining third can be split up into the two types that we can call the ‘relatives’ reunion’ and the ‘sportsman’s triumph’.

Young lovers perform the full embrace, not only when they meet and part, but also frequently during the times they are together. Amongst older couples, after marriage, it is rare to see a full embrace in public unless one partner is going away for some time, or returning from a separation of at least some days. At other times, if the embrace occurs at all, it will be publicly expressed merely as a token contact of a rather mild kind.

Between adult relatives, such as brothers and sisters, or parents and their adult children, the passionate embrace is even less common. It does occur with remarkable predictability, however, whenever there has been some major disaster from which one of the relatives has escaped. If he or she has been hijacked, kidnapped, taken captive, or trapped by some upheaval of nature, then you can be sure that the ‘relatives’ reunion’ that follows safe delivery and return will exhibit full embraces of the most intense kind. Under such circumstances the action may even extend to close friends of either sex, who would normally give only a handshake or a kiss on the cheek. Such is the emotional intensity of the situation that the passionate embracing of a man by a man, or a woman by a woman, or a man-friend by a woman-friend, creates no difficulties with regard to sexual taboos. At a lower emotional intensity there would be more of a problem, but at moments of high drama the taboos are forgotten. In triumph, relief or despair it is acceptable even for two adult males in our culture to hug and kiss one another, but if, in a less dramatic situation, they were to perform a mere fragment of an embrace such as holding hands, or pressing cheek to cheek, they would immediately create a homosexual impression.

This difference is significant and requires explanation. It tells us something about the way in which basic body contacts are fragmented and formalized. To begin with, the full embrace is natural between parent and baby, and therefore also between parent and older child, even though it becomes less frequent. Between adults it is typical of lovers and mates. Other adults who, for a variety of reasons, feel the urge to embrace one another, must therefore somehow make it clear that there is no sexual element in their contact. This they do by employing some formalized fragment of the full embrace, a fragment which by conventional agreement is non-sexual. A man, for example, can put his arm around another man’s shoulder without running any risk of sexual misinterpretation, either by his contact partner, or by others who see him perform the action. If, however, he were to perform other simple fragments, such as, say, kissing the man’s ear, a sexual connotation would immediately be placed upon the act.

The situation is entirely different when two men are seen employing the full embrace, complete with hugging and kissing, in a situation of great triumph, disaster or reunion. No sexual interpretation is made here because it is recognized that the response is not formalized, but basic. The onlookers recognize the situation as being one where the usual conventions are overpowered by the intensity of the emotions involved. They know, intuitively, that what they are witnessing is the return to the primary, pre-sexual embrace of infancy, with all the layers of later, adult stylization stripped away, and they accept the contact as being perfectly natural. In fact, if two male homosexuals wished to make body contact in public without arousing the usual heterosexual hostility or curiosity, they would do better to indulge in a wild hug rather than a gentle kiss.

By studying the various formal fragments of the basic embrace, we should therefore be able to see how convention has pigeon-holed them into different categories, so that each one now signals something quite specific about the nature of the relationship between the ‘contacters’.

Before doing this, however, there is still the third category of the full embrace to be mentioned, namely the ‘sportsman’s triumph’. The embrace of two men following a major disaster has been with us for a long time, but the passionate hugging of football players after a goal has been scored is something comparatively recent. How is it that this occasion has suddenly been elevated to the ranks of a major emotional experience? To find the answer we have to go much further afield than the football pitch. We do, in fact, have to go back many hundreds of years.

Two thousand years ago, when the world was less crowded and the relationships between members of a community were more clearly defined, the full embrace was much more commonly used as an ordinary form of greeting between equals. The embrace-and-kiss was employed between men and men as well as between women and women and between non-amorous men and women. In ancient Persia it was even common for men of equal rank to kiss one another on the mouth, reserving the kiss on the cheek for someone of slightly inferior status. It was more usual in other places, however, for the cheek kiss to be employed between equals. This situation persisted for many centuries, and was still to be found in medieval England, where valiant knights would kiss and embrace one another at times when their modern equivalents would do no more than nod and shake an outstretched hand.

Towards the end of the seventeenth century the situation in England began to change, and the non-sexual greeting embrace went into a rapid decline. This began in the towns and slowly spread to the country, as we know from a line in Congreve’s The Way of the World: ‘You think you’re in the country, where great lubberly brothers slabber and kiss one another when they meet. ’Tis not the fashion here; ’tis not indeed, dear brother.’

Social life in the cities was becoming more crowded and personal relationships more complex and confusing, and with the arrival of the nineteenth century further restrictions were imposed. Now even the elaborate bowing and curtsying that had survived through the eighteenth century became more and more limited to formal occasions and lost their everyday role. By the 1830s that minimal body contact, the handshake, had arrived, and it has been with us ever since.

Similar trends were taking place elsewhere, but not always to the same extent. The Latin countries tended to restrict their body contacts far less than the British, and, even into the twentieth century, friendly embraces between adult males remained far more acceptable. They do so to this day, and this is where we return to the case of the ‘footballer’s hug’. Football, which began as a British sport, spread rapidly in the present century to many parts of the world. In Latin countries it became especially popular, and before long international matches of great emotional intensity were being played. When Latin teams visited England, the passionate embracing of their members, following a successful goal, was at first met with astonishment and derision, but the excellence of their playing soon changed all that. As the years passed, the ‘Well done, old chap’ of the British players when one of their members scored began to seem almost churlish. Back-patting gave way to mild embracing, and mild embracing grew into wild hugging, until today spectators have become quite accustomed to seeing a goal-scorer almost submerged beneath a dense cluster of passionately hugging congratulators.

In this one specific context, then, we have gone full circle back to the times of medieval knights and the ancient world beyond. It remains to be seen whether this trend will extend to other spheres. It may do so, but there is one limitation we must bear in mind. The players embracing on their football field are in a strictly non-sexual context. Their roles are clearly defined and their physical masculinity is being strongly demonstrated by the toughness of the game they are playing. In a social situation of a less clearly defined type, the situation would be different, and the usual restrictions of our complex society will probably then continue to apply. Only in spheres where the expression of powerful emotions is part of the ordinary stock-in-trade, such as the acting profession, can we expect to find major exceptions. If the rest of us find the social embracings of actors and actresses somewhat excessive, we must remember three things. Not only are they trained to show passions easily, but they are also put under severe emotional strain by the nature of their work and, in addition, theirs happens to be a particularly insecure occupation. They need all the mutual reassurance they can get.

Leaving the full embrace now, we can start to look at its less intense forms of expression. So far we have been dealing with the maximal frontal embrace, in which the two partners are pressed close together with the sides of their heads in contact and their arms wrapped tightly around one another’s bodies. When this action is performed at a lower intensity, there are usually three major changes. The bodies now make contact side to side instead of face to face; only one arm is wrapped around the partner’s body instead of two; and the heads are usually apart instead of touching. My observations reveal that, between adults in public, a partial embrace of this type is six times as likely to occur as a full embrace.fn1

The shoulder embrace. The most common form of partial embrace is the shoulder embrace, in which one person wraps an arm around his partner so that the hand comes to rest on his far shoulder. This is twice as common as any other form of partial embrace.

The first difference to emerge, when comparing this with the full frontal embrace, is that it is predominantly a masculine act. Whereas the full embrace was given more or less equally by males and females, the shoulder embrace is five times more likely to be performed by a male than by a female. The reason is simple enough: men are taller than women, and women will always have to look up to them physically, no matter what their attitudes may be in other respects. The consequence of this anatomical difference is that certain body contacts are much easier for men than for women, and the shoulder embrace is one of these.

This fact gives the shoulder embrace a special quality. Since, when it is performed between a man and a woman, it is nearly always done by the man, this means that there is nothing effeminate about it. This in turn means that it is also available for use between males in casual, friendly situations, without giving any sexual flavour to the contact. About one in four shoulder embraces do, in fact, occur between males, and this is the only form of body embrace that does occur commonly in an all-male context. The difference with the full frontal embrace is striking. There, if two males were involved, the situation was typically one of high drama, or intense emotion, but here the context can be much more relaxed, the usual scene being one of team-mates, ‘old pals’ or ‘buddies’.

This ‘safely masculine’ rule does not apply to other types of partial embrace, such as putting the arm around the partner’s waist. Since this is easier for either sex to do and since it also brings the hand closer to the genital region, it is rarely if ever employed between males.

If we now move still further away from the full embrace, shifting our attention from partial embraces to mere fragments of the complete act, we find similar differences. Some embrace fragments have a non-sexual quality and can be used freely between males, while others retain a more amorous flavour and are largely restricted to use between lovers and mates.

The hand-on-shoulder. A common action is placing one hand on the partner’s shoulder, without involving any actual embrace. This is a simple reduction of the shoulder embrace and, as we might expect, is employed in similar contexts. Being slightly less intimate, it is even more common between males. Whereas only one in four of the shoulder embraces was done between two males, here the figure is one in three.

The arm-link. If we watch the embrace disintegrate still further, to a mere linking of arms, then the situation shows a striking change. Here, instead of increasing, the figure for males sinks to one in twelve, and we have to ask the question why, with an even less intimate form of body contact, men should become so much less inclined to link arms with other men rather than with women. The answer is that this action is basically feminine. When it occurs between males and females, it is five times more likely to be done by a female to a male than the other way around. This exactly reverses the position we found in the shoulder embrace, and means that if this contact is to be made between members of the same sex, it is going to have an effeminate quality. This leads to a prediction that if it is going to occur between friends of the same sex, it should occur more between women than between men, and observations do, in fact, bear this out.

If we look for cases where one man does link his arm through that of another, then we find that they fall into two categories: the Latin and the elderly. Latin males, with their culturally freer body contacts, often do it, and in non-Latin Western countries it can also be observed as the support-seeking act of an elderly male who is past the sexually potent phase of life.

The hand-in-hand. Continuing our anatomical progress away from the full embrace, via the shoulder embrace, the hand-on-shoulder and the arm-in-arm, we come finally to the hand-in-hand (not to be confused with the handshake, which is discussed separately later). Although this is a more remote form of contact than the last three, with the two bodies usually kept separate from one another, it does have something in common with the full embrace that the others do not. It is a mutual act. I can place my hand on your shoulder, for example, without you doing anything, but if I hold your hand, you are also going to be holding mine. Since it occurs frequently between a male and a female, and since they are always both doing it, it acquires neither a masculine nor a feminine quality, but rather a heterosexual one. This makes it, in effect, like a tiny version of the full embrace, and it is not surprising, therefore, to find that it is seldom used today between two males in public.

This was not always the case. Back in the days when the full embrace was freely employed between men, they could also be seen holding hands as an act of non-sexual friendship. To give one example, on an occasion when two medieval monarchs met, it is recorded that they ‘took each other by the hand, when the king of France led the king of England to his tent; the four dukes took each other by the hand and followed them.’ Before long this custom faded and ‘leading by the hand’ became restricted to use between males and females. In modern times the action has become modified in two different directions. On formal occasions, such as when a male escorts a female into a banquet, or down the aisle of a church, it has grown into the more reassuring arm-link. On less formal occasions it has changed into the typical hand-holding of mutually grasped palms. And sometimes, when greater intimacy is required, a couple can be seen to perform both acts at the same time.

Despite this general trend, there are certain specialized occasions when males in our modern world do still hold hands. One example is the multiple hand-holding that occurs when a whole group of people are joining hands with one another to do such things as sing community songs, or take curtain calls in the theatre. Even here the tendency is to alternate the positions of the males and females, so that each person is flanked by members of the opposite sex, but if the numbers are not equal, or if it is too difficult to jostle everyone into the correct positionings, then it is permissible to hold hands with your own sex. This is because you are not in any sense forming a pair with them. The very size of the group eliminates the potential sexual flavour of the hand-holding.

Another highly stylized version of hand-holding that can occur between males is for one of them to take the other’s hand in his own and raise it high in the air as a sign of victory. Although this originates from the world of boxing, it is perhaps more frequently met with today between pairs of male politicians, who appear to fantasize imaginary boxing-gloves on the hands of their victorious colleagues. The hand-holding is permissible in this context because of the primarily aggressive nature of the arm-raising gesture. In its more original form, prior to the hand-holding embellishment, this movement of holding the raised fist aloft was undoubtedly a winning fighter’s signal that he was still capable of hitting, at a stage when his rival was not. It is the frozen intention movement of delivering an overarm blow and is the same gesture that has been adopted as the modern communist salute. Studies of fighting behaviour between young children have revealed that this form of hitting, bringing the arm downwards from above, is very basic to our species and does not have to be learned. So it is interesting to see that the modern boxer still uses the intention movement of this action as a victory gesture, even though, in his actual fighting, he no longer employs it, but uses instead highly stylized and ‘unnatural’ frontal punches. It is also intriguing to notice how, in more informal fighting, such as that which occurs during street rioting, both the police and the rioters revert largely to the more primitive form of overarm hitting.

Returning now to the question of males holding hands in public, there is one final special context in which this occurs. It concerns priests, and especially those of high rank in the Catholic Church. The Pope, for instance, can frequently be seen to hold hands with his followers, both male and female, and this exception illustrates the way in which a well-known public figure can set himself outside normal conventions. The Pope’s image is so totally non-sexual that he can perform a whole variety of fragmented intimacies with perfect strangers, intimacies which ordinary citizens could never contemplate. Who else, for example, could reach out and hold the cheeks of a beautiful girl in a completely non-sexual way? The Pope is, in fact, able to behave very much like the ‘holy father’ that he is called, and can confidently make intimate body contacts with adult strangers in the same way as a real father would do with his real children. By adopting the role of a super-father, the pontiff can strip away the body-contact restrictions that others must use, and return to the more natural and primary intimacies typical of the early parent-offspring phase. If he still appears more inhibited with his followers than a real father would be with his children, this is not due to the sexual confusion that restricts the rest of us, but simply to the fact that, in the face of a family of 500 million children, he has to conserve his strength.

Up to this point we have been moving away from the full embrace by travelling, as it were, across the shoulders and down the arm to the hand, and in that direction we can go no further. Instead, we can look at what other parts of the body come into contact with one another during the full embrace, and see if there, too, there are sources of useful fragments that can be employed in day-to-day encounters.

The pressing together of the trunks and legs during the full frontal embrace does not appear to be a very rich source and it is not hard to see why. For adults to touch one another in these regions, in public, brings them too close to the forbidden sexual zones. But there is another important contact region involved in the full embrace, and that is the head. At high intensities, the sides of the heads are pressed together, caressed with the hands or touched with the lips, and from these actions we do find the development of three important fragments that are widely used in everyday life. They can be labelled as the head-to-head contact, the hand-to-head contact and the kiss.

The head contacts. Touching the partner’s head with the hand, and putting the two heads together, are both specialities of young lovers. This is especially true of the former. Hand-to-head contacts are four times as common between young lovers as between older married couples. Head-to-head contacts are twice as common with young lovers, and in both cases this contrasts with an intimacy such as the shoulder embrace, which is more common between the older couples.

Males rarely employ these head contacts with other males. When men ‘put their heads together’, they do not usually do it literally, the function being to indulge in intimate conversation rather than true body intimacy. If a male hand touches a male head, it usually does so for one of three special reasons: giving first aid, bestowing a blessing or delivering an attack. If a male (or a female) encounters an accident victim, the helplessness of the wounded person transmits strong infantile signals that are hard to resist. Photographs of the victims of assassination attempts, for example, nearly always show someone cradling the victim’s head in their hands. Medically this is a somewhat dubious procedure, but medical logic has no place here. This is not a trained act of assistance; it is a more basic response related to the primary parental care of a helpless child. It is much too difficult for an untrained person to pause and make a reasoned assessment of the physical injuries the victim has sustained before taking first-aid action. Instead, he will reach out and touch or lift as a primary act of comfort, with no thought to the further damage he may be causing. It is too painful to stand by and coldly calculate the best steps to be taken. The urge to make comforting body contact is overpowering, but we have to face the fact that it can sometimes prove fatal. Once, as a small boy, ignorant of what was happening, I watched a man killed in this way. Following an accident, his injured body was cradled in the loving arms of anxious helpers who lifted him into a car to drive him away. The loving act destroyed his life by pressing his splintered ribs through his lungs. Had he been ‘callously’ left lying where he was until a stretcher arrived, he might have lived. Such is the power of the urge to make body contact when tragedy strikes, and this applies to males and females equally, for disaster knows no sex.

The bestowing of priestly blessings is equally sexless, as in the laying on of hands of a bishop in ordination or confirmation. Here we are back again to a copy of the primary parent-child relationship.

The delivering of an attack by the hand of one male to the head of another requires little comment in itself, but it does provide one possible source of inter-male intimacy. If a man feels the friendly urge to touch another man’s head but is inhibited about making it a friendly caress, he can employ the simple device of mock-aggression. Instead of fondling his partner’s head, which would have too strong a sexual flavour, he can deliver a playful ‘pretend-attack’, such as ruffling the hair or squeezing the neck in a mock-grasp. Just as play-fighting helped the parent to prolong intimacies with his growing children, so many a fragment of play-assault can be observed between male friends, enabling them to be both manly and intimate at one and the same time.

The kiss. This brings us to the last of the important derivatives of the primary embrace, namely the kiss, an action with an intriguing and complex history. If you feel that a kiss is a simple enough act, think for a moment about the many ways in which you do it, even in today’s supposedly informal society. You kiss your lover on the lips, an old friend of the opposite sex on the cheek, an infant on the top of the head; if a child hurts a finger, you kiss it ‘to make it better’; if you are about to face danger, you kiss a mascot ‘to bring you luck’; if you are a gambler, you kiss the dice before you roll them; if you are the best man at a wedding, you kiss the bride; if you are religious, you kiss the bishop’s ring as a sign of respect, or the Bible when taking an oath; if you are bidding someone farewell and they are already out of reach, you kiss your own hand and blow the kiss towards them. No, the kiss is not a simple matter, and to understand it we must once again turn back the clock.

The most sensitive areas of skin on the human body are the tips of the fingers, the clitoris, the tip of the penis, the tongue and the lips. It is not surprising, therefore, that the lips should be used a great deal in intimate body contacts. Their role begins in the act of sucking at the mother’s breast, which provides a major tactile reward in addition to the reward of obtaining milk. This has been proved by studying the behaviour of unfortunate babies who have been born with an abnormal, blocked oesophagus, and who have to be fed by artificial means. It was observed that if they were given rubber teats to suck, this helped to calm them down and stopped them crying. Since they had never taken any food through the mouth, the reward of having a teat between the lips could have nothing to do with the pleasure of the milk supply that normally results from such an action. It had to be a case of contact for contact’s sake. So the touching of something soft with the mouth is an important and primary intimacy in its own right.

As the child grows and exchanges head-to-head contacts with the mother, feeling her lips pressed to his skin and his to hers, it is easy to see how this early mouth contact can develop into a potent act of friendly greeting. In the embrace of childhood, the usual position for the lips when touching the parent will be the cheek or the side of the head. As I have already mentioned, in ancient times, when the full embrace was given more freely between adults of either sex, the kiss on the cheek was the usual form of mouth contact employed between equals. This was, in a sense, the primitive greeting kiss taken straight from childhood with little modification, and it has persisted through the centuries right down to the present day. In our culture, male and female friends and relatives still kiss in this way when meeting or parting, and the act can be performed without any sexual implication whatever. The same is true of adult females with adult females. Between adult males the situation varies considerably from country to country, with France, for example, remaining much closer to the ancient system than England.

Direct mouth-to-mouth kissing has taken a different course. At various times and in various places it has been employed to some extent as a non-sexual greeting between close friends, but the joining of two body orifices in this way has usually seemed to be an act of too great an intimacy even for close friends, and generally speaking it has become more and more restricted to contacts between lovers and mates.

Since the female breasts are sexual signals as well as feeding devices, the kissing of a female breast by an adult male has also become totally sexual in context, despite the similarity of the act to the primitive action of sucking at the breast in infancy. Needless to say, kissing of the genitals is also exclusively sexual, and so indeed is the kissing of many other parts of the body, especially the trunk, thighs and ears. Certain specific parts of the body, however, have been formally set aside for a special kind of non-sexual kissing – what we might call the subordinate kiss, or the kiss of reverence. This differs categorically from both the friendly kiss and the sexual kiss, and to understand it we must look at the way in which a subordinate human being presents himself in front of a dominant.

It is well known from studies of animal behaviour that one way to appease the wrath of a dominant animal is to make yourself seem smaller and therefore less threatening to him. If you threaten him less, then he is less likely to see you as a challenge to his superiority and therefore less likely to take damaging action against you. He will simply ignore you as being beneath him, both metaphorically and literally, which, if you happen to be the weaker animal, is precisely what you want (at least for the moment). And so we see all manner of cringings and crouchings, grovellings and hunchings-up, downcast eyes and lowered heads, in a wide variety of animal species.

It is the same with man. Where there are no formalities, the response takes the animal form of cringing low on the ground, but in many situations the response of the inferior man has become highly stylized, and these stylizations have varied considerably from place to place and from time to time. This does not put them outside the realm of a biological analysis, however, for they all, without exception, still reveal basic features that clearly relate them to the submissive behaviour of other species of animals.

The most extreme form of submissive body-lowering ever seen in man is full prostration, in which the whole body lies flat on the ground, face down. You simply cannot get any lower than that without an act of burial. The dominant, on the other hand, can, and often did, enhance the lowering effect by viewing it from a raised platform or throne. This total act of servility was common and widespread in the ancient kingdoms, performed by prisoners to their captors, slaves to their masters, and servants to their rulers. Between it and the act of standing fully erect, there is a whole range of formalized submissions, and we can scan them briefly in ascending order.

Next to the full prostration comes the kowtow of the Eastern world, in which the body does not lie, but kneels down and then bends the trunk low until the forehead is touching the ground. Coming one stage up from this is the full kneel, with both knees on the ground, but without the forward bending of the body. This, too, was frequently used in the ancient world when confronting an overlord, but by medieval times it had already risen to the half-kneel, with only one knee lowered to the ground. Men were then specifically instructed to reserve the full kneel for God, who by this time had to be given a little more respect than the rulers of the day. In modern times it is rare for us to kneel to any man at any time, except on certain state occasions in the presence of royalty, but worshippers in church have not changed the ancient full-kneel custom to this day, God having maintained his dominant status rather more successfully than modern rulers.

Coming one stage further up, we reach the curtsy (or courtesy), which was no more than an intention movement of the half-kneel. One leg was drawn back slightly, as if its knee was going to go down and touch the ground, and then both knees started to bend, but neither reached ground level. The body was not bowed forward. Up until the time of Shakespeare both men and women made the curtsy. In this respect, at least, there was equality between the sexes. The male bow had not yet appeared. With the arrival of the curtsy, the act of servility was further reduced, and the half-kneel started to fade from the scene, being given only to royalty.

In the seventeenth century the sexes split up, the men now bowing from the waist while the women retained the curtsy. Both actions lowered the body in front of the dominant individual, but in entirely different ways. From that day to this the situation has remained much the same, except that the extent of the actions has been reduced. The flowery male bowing of the Restoration period gave way to the much simpler and stiffer bow of Victorian times, and the curtsy dwindled to little more than a bob down and up. Today, except in the presence of powerful rulers or royalty, the curtsy is rarely given by women, and the male bow, if given at all, is seldom more than a mere lowering and raising of the head.

The one exception to this rule occurs at the end of a theatrical performance, when, for some reason, the performers slip back several centuries and indulge in deep bows and elaborate curtsies. It is amusing that here we sometimes also see an entirely new trend, with female performers bowing deeply as if they were males. It looks as if this return to sexual equality in the act of subordination is mirroring the new trend towards female equality in all other matters, but if this is the case, the males can at least claim that it was the females who changed to the male action, rather than that the males had to return to their medieval curtsying. It is just possible that there is another reason altogether for the actress’s bow which has nothing to do with the masculinizing of the modern female in our culture. It may instead have to do with the precise opposite, dating back to the earlier times of play-acting, when all the actors were male, and half the men were feminized to play the female roles. Perhaps the modern actress when she bows is by force of tradition merely imitating her male transvestite predecessors. Even allowing for the persistence of ancient traditions, however, this explanation appears improbable. It seems much more likely that she feels she is joining the men.

All the bowing and scraping of yesterday’s everyday greetings has now been almost universally replaced by the far more forthright and upstanding handshake. In this act, at last, there is no lowering of the body. We greet erect and, in so doing, have travelled the full distance from flat prostration. Today all men are not only ‘born equal’, but are still considered to be so, in greetings at least, when they are fully adult.

I have gone into these formalities of greeting at some length, despite the fact that, until we reach the handshake, they do not in themselves involve the intimacies of body contact. This digression was necessary because of their importance in relation to the kiss of reverence. I began by saying that, in ancient times, two equals kissed one another on the cheek, that is, at equal body height. But for an inferior to kiss a superior in this way would have been unthinkable. If he was to show his friendship by a touch of the lips, then that touch had to be performed at a level low enough to match his inferiority. For the lowest subordinates this meant the act of kissing the dominant one’s foot. For an abject prisoner even this was too good, and he was forced to kiss the ground near the dominant shoe. In modern times these actions are rare, rulers not being what they once were, but even now the ruler of Ethiopia, for example, may find himself accorded this honour by one of his subjects in a public place. And slang phrases such as ‘kiss the dirt’, ‘bite the dust’ and ‘boot-licker’ are still with us to remind us of the humiliations of yesterday.

For those of slightly less inferiority, it was permissible to kiss the hem of a garment, or to kiss the knee of the dominant individual. A bishop, for instance, was permitted to kiss the Pope’s knee, but a lesser mortal had to be content with kissing the cross embroidered on his right shoe.

Coming one step further up the body, we arrive at the kiss on the hand. This, too, was performed to many a dominant male, but today, apart from high-ranking priests, we reserve it entirely as a mark of respect to a lady, and even then only in certain countries and on certain occasions.

There were therefore four points on the body which were licensed, so to speak, for non-sexual kissing: the cheek, for friendly equality; the hand, for deep respect; the knee, for humble submission; and the foot, for grovelling servility. The action of touching with the lips was the same in each case, but the lower the point of its application, the lower was the expression of relative status. Despite all the pomp and ritual, nothing could be closer to a sequence of typical animal appeasement gestures. When stripped in this way of the fussy details of cultural variation and viewed as a whole, even the most courtly of human behaviour patterns come remarkably close to the patterns of animal behaviour we see all around us.

Earlier I listed a number of forms of modern kissing, some of which I may not appear to have explained: for example, kissing the dice before rolling them, kissing a lucky mascot, or a hurt finger to make it well. These and other similar actions, all of which are basically concerned with bringing good luck, are related to the kiss of reverence I have been describing. It is impossible to kiss God, the most dominant one of all, and so worshippers have to make do with symbols of God, such as crosses, Bibles, and similar objects. Since kissing them symbolizes kissing God, the act brings good luck simply because it appeases God. Any lucky mascot, therefore, is being treated as a holy relic. It may be odd to think of a gambler in Las Vegas kissing God when he blows on his dice during a crap game, but that is in effect what he is doing, just as when he crosses his fingers for good luck he is doing no more and no less than making a reverential sign of the cross to protect him from God’s wrath. When we kiss our hands in farewell and blow a kiss to our departing friends, we are performing another ancient act, for in earlier days it was more servile to kiss one’s own hand than the hand of the dominant person. The hand-kiss at the modern airport is the only survivor of this custom, even though it is now distance rather than servility that makes us perform the movement.

The handshake. With that farewell kiss, we leave the world of the fragmented embrace, with all its complexities, and come to the last of the adult body contacts that is important enough to be examined in detail, namely the handshake. I have already mentioned that this did not gain wide usage until about a hundred and fifty years ago, but its precursor, the hand-clasp, was employed long before that. In ancient Rome it was used as a pledge of honour, and this was to remain its primary function for nearly two thousand years. In medieval times, for instance, a man might kneel and clasp hands with his superior as an act of swearing allegiance to him. The addition of a shaking movement to the clasping hands is mentioned as early as the sixteenth century. The phrase ‘they shook hands and swore brothers’ appears in Shakespeare’s As You Like It, where again the function is the binding of an agreement.

In the early part of the nineteenth century the situation changed. Although the handshake was still employed after the making of a promise or a contract, as an act of sealing it, it was now for the first time used in ordinary greetings. The cause of this change was the industrial revolution and the massive expansion of the middle classes, forcing an ever widening wedge between the aristocracy and the peasants. These new middlemen, with their businesses and their trades, were forever ‘doing deals’ and ‘making agreements’, and sealing them with the inevitable handshakings. Dealing and trading was becoming the new way of life, and social relationships began more and more to revolve around them. In this way the contractual handshake invaded the social occasion. Its message became the bartering one of ‘I offer you an exchange of friendly greeting’. Gradually it ousted the other forms of greeting until today it has become universally used as the principal act performed, not only when meeting equals, but also when meeting both subordinates and superiors. Whereas once we would have had a wide range of alternatives to suit each type of social encounter, today we have merely this one. What a president does to a farm worker is now the same as what a farm worker does to a president – they both offer a hand, clasp it and shake it, both smiling as they do so. Furthermore, when a president meets another president, or a farm worker meets another farm worker, they will behave in precisely the same way. In terms of body intimacies, times have certainly changed. But if the ubiquitous handshake has simplified matters in one way, it has complicated them in another. We may know that it is the thing to do, but when precisely do we do it? Who offers the hand to whom?

Modern books of etiquette are full of conflicting advice, clearly indicating the confusion that exists. One tells us that a man never holds out his hand to a woman for a handshake, while another informs us that in many parts of the world it is the man who takes the initiative. One tells us that a younger man should never offer his hand to an older one, while another advises that, whenever we are in doubt, we should offer the hand, rather than risk hurting someone’s feelings. One authority insists that a woman should rise to shake hands, another that she should remain seated. Further complications exist in respect of whether we are hosts or guests, male hosts offering their hands to female guests, but male guests waiting for a female hand to be offered to them. There are also separate rules for business and social occasions. One book goes so far as to say that ‘There are no rules as to when to shake hands,’ but clearly this is a statement of despair, the truth being that there are in fact far too many rules.

Obviously there is some hidden complication in the superficially simple act of handshaking which we must unravel if we are to understand these confusions. To do this we must look back at the origins of the act. If we go back as far as our animal relatives, we find that a subordinate chimpanzee will often appease a dominant one by reaching out towards it with a limp hand, as if making a begging gesture. If the action is returned, the two animals briefly touch hands in a contact that looks remarkably like an abbreviated handshake. The initial signal reads, ‘See, I am just a harmless beggar who dare not attack you,’ and the reply is, ‘I will not attack you either.’ Developing into a friendly gesture between equals, the message then becomes simply, ‘I will not hurt you, I am your friend.’ In other words, the chimpanzee hand-offering can be done either by a subordinate to a dominant, as a submissive act, or by a dominant to a subordinate, as a reassuring one, or it can be performed between equals as an act of friendship. Nevertheless, in this respect, it is fundamentally an appeasement gesture and, translated into the modern terms of the etiquette books, we would expect more emphasis to be placed on the inferior individual offering the hand first, to the superior.

Advancing now to the ancient human hand-clasp, we can see this in a similar light. Specifically, the offering of an empty hand revealed that there was no weapon in it, which would explain why we always use the right, or weapon, hand. Showing the hand in this way could be done either submissively, by a weaker to a stronger, or reassuringly, by a stronger to a weaker, as in the chimpanzee case. Developed into a strong, mutual hand-clasp, it became a vigorous pact-making device with two men accepting one another, momentarily at least, as equals. Essentially, however, it remains an act in which neither performer is asserting his dominance but, regardless of his relative status, is temporarily displaying himself as harmless.

This is one likely origin for the modern handshake, but there is another that confuses the picture. One of the important greeting acts of a male to a female was the kissing of the hand. To do this, the man took her offered hand in his before applying his lips to it. As this action became more stylized, the actual kissing element declined in intensity to a point where the mouth only approached the back of the lady’s hand and stopped before making contact, the lips then forming a kiss in mid-air. Becoming even more fossilized, the act then sometimes occurred as a mere holding and raising of the lady’s hand, accompanied by a slight bow of the head towards it. In this modified form it is little more or less than a weak handshake, but with the vigorous pumping action omitted. One writer has seen this as the sole source of the modern handshake: ‘As a contact salutation the handshake would appear to be a late derivative of the “face-kiss”, with the “hand-kiss” as a connecting link.’ In this respect, offering the hand is essentially the act of asserted dominance towards a subordinate, and therefore differs fundamentally from the display of the male-pact handshake.

The truth appears to be that both the hand-clasp theory and the hand-kiss theory are correct, and that this double origin is the cause of all the confusion in the modern etiquette books. The point is that we do not today shake hands for a single reason only. We do it as a greeting, as a farewell, to make a pact, to seal a bargain, to congratulate, to accept a challenge, to give thanks, to commiserate, to make up after a squabble and to wish one another luck. There are two elements here. In some cases it symbolizes a friendly bond, in others merely that we are friendly at the moment of shaking. If I shake hands with a man when I am introduced to him for the first time, it is merely a courtesy and says nothing about our past or even our future relationship.

To put it another way, we can say that the modern handshake is a double act masquerading as a single one. The ‘pact handshake’ and the ‘greeting handshake’ have different origins and different functions, but because they have come to have the same form, we think of them both simply as the ‘friendly handshake’. Hence all the confusion. Up to early Victorian times there was no problem. Then there was the pact handshake for males with males which said ‘it’s a deal’, and the hand-kiss for males with females which said ‘it’s an honour to meet you’. But when the Victorians increasingly began to mix business with social life, the two became blended and muddled together. The vigorous pact handshake became softened and weakened, while the gentle clasping of the lady’s hand in the already abbreviated hand-kiss became strengthened.

Although we accept this happily enough today, there was some resistance to it in nineteenth-century France, where the greeting shake was referred to as ‘the American handshake’, and frowned upon when it was done between visiting males and unmarried French girls. The reason for this was not so much the body contact involved, but simply that the French were still interpreting the handshake in its old masculine role. The visiting males were then seen to be ‘making a pact’ and establishing a bond of friendship with young girls they had only just met, which was considered highly improper. The foreign visitors, of course, thought that they were doing no more than offering a polite salutation.

This brings us back to the misunderstandings and confusions of the etiquette books. The big problem is who offers the hand to whom. Is it an insult to fail to offer the hand first and therefore to appear to be unfriendly, or to offer it first and therefore to appear to be demanding a modified hand-kiss? Careful observation of social occasions reveals that the confused greeters tend to solve the problem by watching for tiny clues. They look for the slightest sign of an intention movement of raising the arm on the part of the other person, and then try to make the contact appear to be simultaneous. Contributing to their confusion is the fact that with most other salutations the subordinate acts first to show his respect. The private salutes the officer before the officer salutes the private. In earlier days, it was always the junior who bowed first to the senior. But with kissing the hand it was different. The lady had to offer her hand first. No respectful male would grab it first without waiting for a sign from her. Because the hand-kiss is involved in the origin of handshake greetings, this rule still applies in most cases. The man waits for the woman to offer her hand for shaking, as if she were still offering it to be kissed. However, not to offer the hand to her first, now that the kissing has vanished from the act, is tantamount to saying that he is the officer and she the private, and that she must make the first sign of salute. Hence all the warnings and mumblings of the etiquette experts.

The other origin of the handshake, concerning the making of pacts, further confuses the situation. The weaker male usually offers his hand first here, to show his eagerness to the stronger one. In a contest, it is usually the weaker loser who offers his hand to the stronger winner in the act of congratulation, to show that, despite his defeat, the bond of friendship is reconfirmed. So, for an eager young businessman to greet a senior colleague with an outstretched hand may be looked upon either as brashness (‘you may kiss my hand’), or as humility (‘you are the winner’). Again, as with the social occasions, the problem is usually solved by watching for small intention clues and trying to contrive a simultaneous act.

Given its complicated past and its confused present, one might expect to see the handshake on the decline in the increasingly informal world of today, and in certain contexts this appears to be the case. Social greetings are becoming increasingly verbal. Around the middle of the present century, the etiquette experts announced that ‘Handshaking on introductions between men is nowadays on the wane in Great Britain.’ Despite this, it is still much more common for a male/male shake to occur, rather than a male/female shake or a female/female shake. My observations suggest that two-thirds of all handshaking is done between males; in the remaining third, shaking between the sexes is three times as common as between females. These figures fit well with the history of the action, for men have inherited the handshake as a pact device and then added to it the greeting function, giving the all-male pattern double value, so to speak. Women with men have inherited it from the hand-kiss, but have not yet taken an equal role in business, so are poor on pact handshakes. And women with women never did hand-kiss, so are poor on both, and come at the bottom of the handshaking league.

A final point about this particular form of body contact, which may seem obvious but is significant nevertheless, is that lovers do not do it. Nor, in most countries, do married couples. Ask an Englishman who has been married for, say, twelve years when he last greeted his wife by shaking hands with her, and the answer is more likely to be twelve years than twelve days. This is, without any doubt, the least amorous of all friendly body contacts. In all the other cases mentioned in this chapter, from the full embrace to the kiss, there has always been a strong sexual element. They have all originated from the same primary source and they have all been performed more between lovers and mates than between adults in any other roles. When performed between males there have, in most cases, been special circumstances which make this possible. The handshake, by contrast, stemming originally not from a tender embrace but from a masculine act of pact-making, has avoided these difficulties. Even the later involvement of the hand-kiss in its history has not created any problems, because this was already a formalized, de-sexed kiss of reverence before it became incorporated. Strong men have therefore been able to shake one another’s hands until they are blue in the palms without running the slightest risk of creating an amorous impression. The very act of shaking the clasped hands up and down in mid-air that typifies the action helps to make it more brusque and less gentle, and distinguishes it clearly, even at a distance, from the lovers’ act of holding hands.

In this chapter we have looked at the way adults behave towards one another in public and we have seen how the all-enveloping, uninhibited intimacies of infancy have become restricted, pigeon-holed and labelled. It can be argued that this has taken place because adults need greater independence of action and greater mobility than infants, and that more extensive body contacts would limit them in this respect. That would explain the reduction in the amount of time actually spent touching, but not the reduction of the intimacy of the touches that do still occur. It can be argued that it has taken place because adults do not need so much body contact; but if that is so, then why do they spend so much of their time indulging in second-hand intimacy in books, films, plays and television, and why is it that popular songs cry out the message hour after hour? It can be argued that our untouchability has to do with status, with not wishing to be touched by our inferiors and not daring to touch our superiors; but if this is so, then why are we not more intimate with our equals? It can be argued that we do not wish to have our intimate actions confused with those of lovers; but how does this explain the fact that lovers themselves, in public, restrict their intimacies so much more than they do in private?

All these arguments give partial answers, but there is something missing. This hidden factor seems to be the powerful bonding effect that close body intimacies have on those who perform them. We cannot be close physically without becoming ‘close’ emotionally. In our busy modern lives, we hold back from such involvements, even though we may need them. Our relationships are too profuse, too vague, too complex, and often too insincere for us to be able to risk the primitive bonding processes of body intimacy. In the ruthless world of business, we can dismiss a girl with whom we have only shaken hands, or we can betray a colleague with whom we have done no more than rest a hand on a shoulder; but what if the body contacts had been greater? What if, without any sexual involvement, we had experienced greater intimacies with them? Then, without a doubt, we would have seen our tough determination soften, and our competitiveness dwindle, when the moments for brutal decisions came. And if we dare not expose ourselves to these dangers, to these powerful reciprocal involvements that know no logic, then we certainly do not want to be reminded of them by seeing them flaunted in public by others. So the young lovers can keep to themselves and do it in private, and in case they ignore our request we will make it law. We will make it a crime to be intimate in public. And so it is that, even to this day, in certain sophisticated, civilized countries it remains a crime to kiss in public. A tender act of touching becomes immoral and illegal. A gentle intimacy becomes legally equated with an act of theft. So hide it away quickly, lest the rest of us see what we are missing!

It has sometimes been said that if only all the tight-lipped defenders of public morals would embrace one another lovingly, caress one another’s faces, and kiss one another’s cheeks, they might suddenly feel it was time to go home and leave the rest of society to go about its friendly, loving business without having to endure their desperate envy. But it is pointless to despise them, for society stitches its own strait-jacket. The teeming zoo in which we live is not the ideal setting for public intimacies. It suffers from people pollution; we bump into one another and apologize, when we should be reaching out to touch; we collide headlong and curse, when we should be embracing and laughing. There are strangers everywhere and so we hold ourselves back. There seems to be no alternative. Our only compensation is to indulge more heavily in private intimacies, but this we frequently fail to do. It seems as if our public restraint can spread to infect our conduct even in the bosom of our families. For many, the solution is to indulge in second-hand intimacies by spending the evening hours avidly watching the abandoned touchings and embracings of the professionals on our television or cinema screens, listening to endless words of love in our popular songs, or reading them in our novels and magazines. For some, there are other, more heavily disguised alternatives, as we shall see on the pages that follow.
