title: 2 Invitations to Sexual Intimacy
---




EVERY HUMAN BODY is constantly sending out signals to its social companions. Some of these signals invite intimate contact and others repel it. Unless we are accidentally thrown against someone’s body, we never touch one another until we have first carefully read the signs. Our brains, however, are so beautifully tuned in to the delicate business of assessing these invitation signals that we can often sum up a social situation in a split second. If we unexpectedly spot a loved one amongst a crowd of strangers, we can be embracing them within a few moments of setting eyes on them. This does not imply carelessness; it simply means that the computers inside our skulls are brilliant at making rapid, almost instantaneous calculations concerning the appearance and mood of all the many individuals we encounter during our waking hours. The hundreds of separate signals coming from the details of their shape, size, colour, sound, smell, posture, movement and expression, crowd at lightning speed into our specialized sense organs, the social computer whirrs into action, and out comes the answer, to touch or not to touch.

As babies, our small size and our helplessness act as powerful stimuli encouraging adults to reach out and make friendly contact with us. The flat face, the large eyes, the clumsy movements, the short limbs and the generally rounded contours, all contribute to our touch-appeal. Add to this the broad smile and the alarm signal of crying and screaming, and the human infant is clearly a massive invitation to intimacy.

If, as adults, we send out similar signals of helplessness or pain, as, for instance, when we are sick or the victims of an accident, we provoke a pseudo-parental response of much the same kind. Also, when we are performing the first tentative body contact, in the form of shaking hands, we nearly always accompany it with a smiling facial expression.

These are the basic invitations to intimacy; but, with sexual maturity, the human animal moves into a whole new sphere of contact signals – the signals of sex appeal – which serve to encourage a male and female to start touching one another with more than mere friendliness in mind.

Some of the sex signals are universal and apply to all adult human beings; others are cultural variations on these biological themes. Some concern our adult appearances as males and females, and others have to do with our adult behaviour – our postures, gestures and actions. The simplest way to survey them is to make a tour of the human body, pausing briefly at each of the main points of interest in turn.

The crotch. Since we are dealing with sexual signals, it is logical to start with the primary genital region, and work our way outwards. The crotch is the major taboo zone, and this is not merely because it is the site of the external reproductive organs. Packed into this one small area of the body are all the main taboo subjects: urination, defecation, copulation, fellation, ejaculation, masturbation and menstruation. With this array of activities it is little wonder that it has always been the most concealed area of the human body. To expose it directly to view as a visual invitation to intimacy is much too strong a sexual signal to be employed as a preliminary device, before a relationship has progressed through the earlier stages of body contact. Ironically, by the time that a relationship has reached the more advanced phase of genital intimacy, it is usually too late for visual displaying, so that the first experience of the partner’s genitals is normally tactile. The act of looking directly at the genitals of the opposite sex therefore plays a comparatively small role in modern human courtship. There is, nevertheless, considerable interest in this region of the body, and if direct exposure of the genitals is not possible, alternatives can still be found.

The first is to employ articles of clothing which underline the nature of the organs hidden beneath them. For the female this means wearing trousers, shorts or bathing costumes which are one size too small for comfort, but which, by their tightness, cut into the genital cleft and thereby reveal its shape to the attentive male eye. This is an exclusively modern development, but the male equivalent has a longer history. For a period of nearly two hundred years (from roughly 1408 to 1575) many European male genitals were indirectly displayed in all their glory by the wearing of a codpiece. This began life in a modest way as a front flap which formed a small pouch at the fork of the extremely tight trousers, or hose, worn by the males of the day. The hose were, in fact, so tight that they had little choice. ‘Cod’ is an old word for scrotum, hence the name ‘codpiece’. As the years passed, it grew dramatically in size until it became a blatant phallus-piece, rather than a mere scrotum-piece, and gave the impression that the wearer was the possessor of a permanently erect penis. To emphasize the point further, it was often differently coloured from the surrounding material, and even decorated with gold and jewels. Eventually the codpiece went so far that it began to become something of a joke, so that when Rabelais described the one worn by his hero, he was able to comment that ‘For the codpiece sixteen yards of material was required. The shape was that of a triumphal arch, most elegant and secured by two gold rings fastened to enamel buttons, each the size of an orange and set with heavy emeralds. The codpiece protruded forward as much as three feet.’

Today such extravagant penile displays are missing from the world of fashion, but an echo can still be found, for the young male of the 1960s and 1970s has once again started to wear his ‘hose’ too tight. Like the modern female, he squeezes himself into closely fitting jeans and bathing costumes, in which he is forced to change the resting position of his penis. Unlike the older males, who still fill the generation gap between their legs with a loosely hanging penis beneath their slacker slacks, the younger male of today walks with his penis in the upright position. Held firmly in its vertical posture by the snugly clinging material, it presents a mild but distinctly visible genital bulge to the interested female eye. In this way the young male’s costume once again permits him to display a pseudo-erection and, as with the earlier codpiece, this has surprisingly happened without any undue criticism from puritan quarters. It remains to be seen whether the codpiece itself will make a come-back in the years ahead, and how far the trend will have to go before this male embellishment once again becomes so sexually obtrusive that it falls into disrepute.

Other modern costume-genital displays are of a frankly exotic nature and not in wide use. They include female bathing costumes and panties trimmed with fur in the pubic area, or with lace-up fronts which imitate the shape of the genitals. Another form of indirect genital display that has, without comment, survived the passage of time is the Scotsman’s sporran, a symbolic genital pouch worn in the scrotal region and frequently covered with symbolic pubic hair.

A less direct way of transmitting visual genital signals is to use some other part of the body as a ‘genital-echo’, or copy. This enables a primary sexual message to be transmitted, whilst keeping the real genitals completely obscured. There are several ways in which this is done and to understand them we must look again at the anatomy of the female sex organs. For purposes of symbolism, they consist of an orifice – the vagina – and paired flaps of skin – the minor and major labia. If these are covered up, then any other body organs or details that resemble them in some way are likely to become employed as ‘genital-echoes’, for signalling purposes.

As orifice-substitutes, candidates available are the navel, the mouth, the nostrils and the ears. All have mild taboos associated with them. It is impolite to pick the nose or clean the ear with a finger in a public place. This contrasts with a cleaning action such as wiping the forehead, or rubbing the eyes, which we permit without comment. The mouth is frequently covered for some reason, if not with a veil, at least when we are yawning, gasping or giggling. The navel is even more taboo, having frequently been air-brushed out of photographs completely in past decades, to protect our eyes from its suggestive shape. Of these four types of ‘aperture’, only the mouth and the navel appeal to have been specifically employed as genital-orifice substitutes.

The mouth is by far the most important of these, and transmits a great deal of pseudo-genital signalling during amorous encounters. I suggested in The Naked Ape that the unique development of everted lips in our species may well be part of this story, their fleshy pink surfaces having developed as a labial mimic at the biological, rather than the purely cultural, level. Like the true labia, they become redder and more swollen with sexual arousal, and like them they surround a centrally placed orifice. Since the earliest historical times, the lip signals of the female have been heightened by the application of artificial colouring. Lipstick is today a major cosmetic industry and, although the colours vary from fad to fad, they always return before long to something in the pink-red range, thereby copying the flushing of the labia during the advanced stages of sexual arousal. This is not, of course, a conscious imitation of the genital signals; it is merely ‘sexy’ or ‘attractive’, with no further questions asked.

The lips of the adult female are typically slightly larger and fleshier than those of the male, which is what one would expect if they are playing a symbolic role, and this size difference has sometimes been exaggerated by spreading the lipstick over a wider area than the lips themselves. This also mimics the enlargement they undergo when sexually engorged with blood.

Many authors and poets have seen the lips and mouth as a powerfully erotic region of the body, with the male tongue inserting itself, penis-like, into the female mouth during deep kissing. It has also been suggested that the structure of the lips of a particular female reflects the structure of the (as yet unseen) genitals below. A woman with fleshy lips is supposed to be the possessor of fleshy labia; one with tight, thin lips to have tight, thin genitals. Where this is in fact the case, it does not, of course, reflect the precision of the body-mimicry, but merely the overall somatotype of the female in question.

The navel has excited far less comment than the mouth, but some curious things have been happening to it in recent years which reveal that it does have a distinct role to play as a genital-echo. Not only was it painted out of early photographs, but its exposure was also expressly forbidden by the original ‘Hollywood Code’, so that harem dancing-girls in pre-war films were always obliged to appear with ornamental navel-covers of some kind. No real explanation was ever given for this taboo, except for the lame excuse that the exposure of the navel might start children asking what it was for and thereby precipitate an awkward ‘facts of life’ interlude for the parent. In adult contexts, however, this is clearly nonsensical, and the true reason was obviously that the navel is strongly reminiscent of a ‘secret orifice’. Since harem girls are likely, at the drop of a veil, to start wriggling their abdomens about in an Eastern belly-dance, with the result that this pseudo-orifice starts gaping, stretching and writhing in a sexually inviting manner, Hollywood decided that this indelicate piece of anatomy would have to be masked. Ironically, as we started to move into the second half of the twentieth century and the grip of the Hollywood Code was beginning to relax in the West, the Arab world, with its new-found republican spirit, set about reversing the trend. Egyptian belly-dancers were officially informed that it was improper and undignified to expose the navel during their ‘traditional folklore’ performances. In future, their new government insisted, the midriff would be suitably covered by some kind of light cloth. And so, as the European and American navels fought their way back, in the cinemas and on the beaches, the blind orifices of North Africa retreated into a new obscurity.

Since their reappearance, the naked navels of the Western world have undergone a curious modification. They have started to change shape. In pictorial representations, the old-fashioned circular aperture is tending to give way to a more elongated, vertical slit. Investigating this odd phenomenon, I discovered that contemporary models and actresses are six times more likely to display a vertical navel than a circular one, when compared with the artist’s models of yesterday. A brief survey of two hundred paintings and sculptures showing female nudes, and selected at random from the whole range of art history, revealed a proportion of 92 per cent of round navels to 8 per cent of vertical ones. A similar analysis of pictures of modern photographic models and film actresses shows a striking change: now the proportion of vertical ones has risen to 46 per cent. This is only partly due to the fact that the girls have become generally much slimmer, for although it is true that a fat, sagging female cannot offer the contemplator of navels a vertical slit, it is equally true that a skinny female need not do so either. Modigliani’s slender girls display navels that are quite as round as those of Renoir’s plump models. Furthermore, two young girls of the 1970s with similar figures can easily display the two distinct navel shapes.

How this change has come about, and whether it has been unconsciously arrived at or knowingly encouraged by modern photographers, is not entirely clear. It appears to have something to do with a subtle alteration in the trunk posture of the displaying model, possibly partly connected with an exaggerated intake of breath. The ultimate significance of the new navel shape is, however, reasonably certain. The classical round navel, in its symbolic orifice role, is rather too reminiscent of the anus. By becoming a more oval, vertical slit, it automatically assumes a much more genital shape, and its quality as a sexual symbol is immensely increased. This, apparently, is what has been happening since the Western navel came out into the open and began to operate more overtly as an erotic signalling device.

The buttocks. Leaving the crotch and its substitute echoes and passing round to the back of the pelvic region, we come to the paired, fleshy hemispheres of the buttocks. These are more pronounced in the female than the male and are a uniquely human feature, being absent in other species of primates. If a human female were to bend down and present her buttocks visually to a male, as if she were adopting the typical primate invitation-to-copulation posture, her genitals would be seen framed by the two hemispheres of smooth flesh. This association makes them an important sexual signal for our species, and one that probably has a very ancient biological origin. It is our equivalent of the ‘sexual swellings’ of other species. The difference is that, in our case, the condition is permanent. In other species the swellings rise and fall with the menstrual cycle, reaching their maximum size when the female is sexually receptive, around the time of ovulation. Naturally, as the human female is sexually receptive at virtually all times, her sexual ‘swellings’ remain permanently ‘inflated’. As our early ancestors became more upright in their standing posture, the genitals came to be displayed more from the front than the rear, but the buttocks still retained their sexual significance. Even though copulation itself became an increasingly frontal affair, the female could still send out sexual signals by emphasizing her rump in some way. Today, if a girl slightly increases the undulations of her buttocks when she walks, it acts as a powerful erotic signal to the male. If she adopts a posture in which they are ‘accidentally’ protruded a little more than usual, this has the same effect. Sometimes, as in the famous ‘bottoms up’ cancan dance posture, the full version of the ancient primate rump-presentation display is still to be seen, and jokes about the man who wants to slap or caress the bottom of the girl who has innocently bent down to pick up a dropped object are commonplace.

From earlier days, there are two buttock phenomena that deserve comment. The first is the natural condition known as ‘steatopygia’, and the second is the artificial device of the bustle. Literally, steatopygia means fat-rumped, and refers to a remarkably pronounced protuberance of the buttocks found amongst certain human cultures, notably the Bushmen of Southern Africa. It has been suggested that this is a case of fat-storage similar to that of the camel’s hump, but since it is much more exaggerated in females than males, it seems more likely that it is a specialization of the sexual signals that emanate from this region of the body. It looks as if the Bushman females went further in the development of this signal than other races. It is even possible that this condition was typical of most of our early ancestors, but that later on it was reduced in favour of a more athletically adaptable compromise in the shape of the less ambitious female buttocks we see around us today. Certainly the Bushmen were once much more common than they are now, and owned much of Africa before the later Negro expansion.

It is also curious that so many prehistoric female figurines, from Europe and elsewhere, frequently show a similar condition, with huge protruding buttocks which are completely out of proportion with the general obesity of the bodies depicted. There are only two explanations. Either prehistoric women were endowed with huge rumps, sending out massive sexual signals to their males, or the prehistoric sculptors were so obsessed with the erotic nature of buttocks that, like many cartoonists of the present day, they permitted themselves a considerable degree of artistic licence. Either way, the prehistoric buttocks reigned supreme. Then, strangely, in region after region, as the art forms advanced, the big-buttocked females began to disappear. In the prehistoric art of every locality where they occur, they are always the earliest figures to be found. Then they are gone, and more slender females move in to take their place. Unless fat-rumped females really were common in earlier days and then gradually died out, the reason for this widespread change in prehistoric art remains a mystery. The male interest in female buttocks survived, but with a few exceptions they now became reduced to the natural proportions we observe on the cinema screens of the twentieth century. The dancing girls depicted on the murals of ancient Egypt could easily find work in a modern night-club and, had Venus de Milo lived, she would have had a hip measurement of no more than 38 inches.

The exceptions to this rule are intriguing, since, in a sense, they demonstrate a throw-back to prehistoric times and show man’s revived interest in gross exaggeration of the female rump region. Here we move from the fleshy phenomenon of steatopygia to the artificial device of the bustle. The effect is the same in both cases – namely, a vast enlargement of the buttock region – but with the bustle this was done by inserting thick padding, or some kind of framework, beneath the female costume. In origin it was a sort of crinoline-in-retreat. The habit of padding the hips all round the pelvic region occurred frequently in European fashions, and all that was needed to permit a new rump-display to appear on the scene was to remove the padding at the front and sides of the body. This made the creation of the bustle a ‘reduction’ rather than an exaggeration and permitted its introduction into high fashion to take place without undue comment. Having arrived negatively in this way, it managed to avoid its obvious sexual implications. The hooped and padded bustle of the 1870s vanished after a few years, but returned in triumph in an even more exaggerated form in the 1880s. Now it became a great shelf sticking out at the back, kept in place by wire netting and steel springs, and created an impression that even a tired Bushman would have responded to. By the 1890s, however, this too was gone, and the increasingly athletic female of the twentieth century has never wished to reinstate it. Instead, the enlarged buttocks of modern times have been confined to rarely used ‘bottom-falsies’, to provocative ‘come-hither’ posturing and to the drawing-boards of the cartoonists.

The legs. Moving downwards from the pelvic region, the female legs have also been the subject of considerable male interest as sexual signalling devices. Anatomically, the outsides of the female thighs have a greater fat deposit than in the male, and at certain periods a plump leg has therefore been an erotic one. At other times, the mere exposure of leg flesh has been sufficient to transmit sexual signals. Needless to say, the higher the exposure goes, the more stimulating it becomes, for the simple reason that it then approaches more closely the primary genital zone. Artificial aids to the legs have included ‘calf-falsies’, to be worn under opaque stockings, but these have been as rarely used as ‘bottom-falsies’. High-heeled shoes have been much more commonly adopted, the tilt of the foot supposedly enhancing the leg contour and also increasing the apparent length of the legs, which relates to the fact that elongation of the limbs is a characteristic of adolescent maturing. ‘Legginess’ equals sexual maturity, and therefore sexiness.

The feet themselves have often been squeezed into shoes which are much too tight for them, a tendency that results from the fact that the foot of the adult female is slightly smaller than that of the adult male. It therefore follows that to increase this difference a little will make the female foot more feminine, as a sexual signal to the male. The petite foot has often been praised by male admirers, and many a female has suffered tortures to obtain it. Byron’s words sum up the traditional masculine attitude, when he writes of ‘feet so small and sylph-like, suggesting the more perfect symmetry of the fair forms which terminate so well’. This view of the female foot is reflected in the perennial story of Cinderella – a tale that can be traced back at least two thousand years – where her ugly sisters have feet too big to fit into the tiny glass slipper. Only the beautiful heroine has small enough feet to win the heart of the Prince.

In China the trend towards small female feet was once taken to horrifying lengths, young girls often having to undergo such tight binding that they suffered serious deformity. The bound foot, or ‘golden lily’, which looked so attractive in its tiny decorated shoe, had more the appearance of a deformed pig’s trotter when it was viewed unshod. So important was this painful practice that a girl’s commercial value was measured by the smallness of her feet, her shoes being displayed to establish her worth during the bartering over bride-price. The modern woman whose ‘feet are killing her’ is merely echoing in a mild way this ancient phenomenon. The official reason given to explain the custom of the ‘golden lilies’ was that it showed that the female in question did not need to work – because she was so crippled that she could not. But her husband did not need to work either, yet his feet remained uncrushed, so that the exaggerated sex-difference element provides a more basic explanation. This rule applies in many other cases as well. A particular distortion, or exaggeration, is officially performed for reasons of ‘high fashion’ or status, but the deeper explanation is that the modification in question in some way emphasizes a female (or male) biological characteristic. The artificial tightening of the female waist is another case in point.

In addition to their anatomy, the posture of the legs is capable of transmitting sexual signals. In many cultures, girls are told that it is improper to stand or sit with the legs wide apart. To do this is to ‘open’ the genitals, and even if they are not visible, the message remains fundamentally the same. With the advent of female trousers and the disappearance of strict codes of etiquette, the legs-apart posture has become much more common in recent years, and is used with increasing frequency by model girls in advertisements. What was once a too-powerful signal has now become merely challenging; what was shocking is now no more than tantalizing. But nevertheless, a girl in a skirt still obeys the old rules. To expose the opened crotch, clad only in panties, remains too strong an invitation signal in most cases.

The traditionally ‘polite girl’ therefore keeps her legs together, but there is a danger, also, if she goes too far in this direction and presses them too tightly against one another. If she does this, or crosses them so vigorously that her thighs are squeezed together, she begins to ‘protest too much’ and thereby makes a new kind of sexual comment. As with all puritan statements, she reveals that she has sex very much on her mind. In fact, the girl who tries to protect her genitals unduly draws almost as much attention to them as the one who exposes them to view. Similarly, if a skirt rides up slightly when a girl sits down and exposes more leg than she intended, she only enhances the sexuality of the situation by making attempts to tug it down again. The only non-sexual signal is the one that avoids both extremes.

For the male, the opening of the legs carries much the same signal as with the female, because here, too, it says ‘I am exposing my genitals to you.’ Sitting with the legs wide apart is the gesture of a dominant, confident male (unless, of course, he is so fat that he cannot get them together).

The belly. Moving up above the genital region now, we come to the belly, which has two characteristic shapes: flat and ‘pot’. Lovers tend to be flat-bellied, while pot-bellies are most commonly seen in starving children and overfed men. The adult female is less likely to become pot-bellied than the adult male, even if she becomes equally overweight. This is because, as a female, her tissues are hungrier for fat in the thigh and hip region than around the belly. If a male and female go far enough, of course, they will both end up with much the same spheroid shape, but at milder levels of overeating the difference in fat-distribution is marked. Many comparatively skinny men manage to develop moderate-sized pot-bellies in middle and old age. What is the explanation for this?

Sometimes a visual joke says more than the artist intended or even understood. A cartoon of a pot-bellied, middle-aged man standing on a beach shows him being approached by a beautiful young girl in a bikini. As she comes near, he spots her and starts to contract his sagging stomach, so that when she is abreast of him his chest is swollen out and his belly held tightly in. As she passes by, the stomach slowly begins to sag again until, as she disappears in the distance, it is completely back to its gross, original shape. This joke was clearly intended to reflect a conscious control of the man’s body contour – and his sexual image – but what it also depicts is something that happens unconsciously and semi-permanently, as part of the male human sexual display. For sexual excitement, or prolonged sexual interest, has the automatic effect of tightening up the stomach muscles. Regardless of individual variations, this is revealed in the general difference in the body contour of young males and old males. Young males are more sexually potent than older ones, and their general body shape goes in more as it goes down. They have the typical masculine display shape of our species, with broadened shoulders, expanded chests, and narrow hips. The flat belly is part of this general body-tapering. The older male tends towards sagging, rounded shoulders, flattened chest, and heavier hips. The swollen belly again is part of this now inverted tapering of the body contour. With this shape, the older male says plainly, ‘I am past the pair-formation stage.’

In modern times, older males, who have made youthfulness and sexual potency into high-status cults, struggle desperately to stem the tide of this almost inevitable contour inversion. They diet ruthlessly, they indulge in physical training, they sometimes even wear tight corsets, and they consciously hold in their loosening stomach muscles as best they can. It would, of course, be much simpler if they could keep on falling in love over and over again. Belly-wise, they would find that an affair is as good as a diet and a corset combined, and that the physical exercise comes built-in. Under the influence of their passionate emotions, their stomach muscles would automatically contract and stay contracted, for by the act of falling in love they would be genuinely and biologically returning to a youthful condition, and their body would do its best to match their mood. Many men do, of course, take steps in this direction from time to time, but unless the process is a more or less continuous one, irreversible contour inversion will have started to take its toll, and their body success will be limited. Needless to say, such steps also play havoc with the older male’s true biological role, which is by now that of the parental head of an established family unit.

The situation has not always been like this. Long ago, before the miracles of modern medicine stretched out our lives to such an unnatural extent, most older males soon vanished beneath the turf. To judge by our primate body weight and various other features of our life cycle, the natural life-span for man is probably somewhere between forty and fifty years, no more. Beyond that everything is a bonus. Also, in previous historical periods, a dominant, ageing male has often maintained his status more by his social power than by his youthfulness. An attractive young female has frequently been bought rather than wooed. A fat lord, or a fat master of the harem, cared little about his gross shape or the anti-sexual signals he transmitted. In the harem, this situation gave birth to the phenomenon of belly-dancing. Originally this consisted of the performance of pelvic thrusts by the female on the podgy, incapacitated form of her lord and master. Unable to make the thrusting movements himself, he had to be serviced by trained girls who would be able to take over the masculine role in the encounter, inserting his immobile penis into their vaginas, and then undulating and jolting their pelvises to stimulate it to a climax, in what amounted to little more than an act of fertile masturbation. The clever and varied movements developed by such females to arouse their fat, dominant males formed the basis of the famous Eastern belly-dance and, as a visual preliminary, this became more and more elaborate, until it grew into the display we see so often today in night-clubs and cabarets.

For the modern male, sexual conquests with no thought given to the masculine invitation signals are largely limited to brief visits to prostitutes. For his long-term relationships, he now has to rely much more heavily on his personal sexual appeal. In this respect he has returned to a much more natural situation for the human species, but at the same time his life-span has been artificially elongated. It is this situation that has led to the new concern about ‘youthfulness and vigour’ for the male who, as he leaves his twenties behind, inevitably starts to feel the decline of his sexual powers. Coasting to a natural death at forty, this would not have posed such a problem, leaving just enough time to rear the offspring and be off. But now, with something more like half a century confronting the post-parental male, the problem has become acute, and we have all the diet books, health farms and other paraphernalia of contemporary life to prove it.

The waist. Here we return again to the sexual-signalling world of the female. The waist is narrower in the female than the male, or appears to be so because of her widened, childbearing hips and her swollen, rounded breasts. Narrowness of waist has therefore become an important female sexual signal, available for artificial exaggerations of the type we have met before. The signal can be made more powerful directly or indirectly, either by tightening the waist or by enlarging the bust and hips. The maximum signal can be transmitted by doing both at once. Busts can be magnified by holding or pushing them up with tight clothing, by padding them out, or by cosmetic surgery. The hips can be enlarged by padding or by the wearing of stiff clothing that curves out from the body. The waist itself can be reduced by tight lacing or the wearing of a belt.

Female waist corsets have a long and sometimes unhappy history. In previous eras they have occasionally become so severe that they have damaged the rib and lung development of young girls and interfered with their healthy respiration. In late Victorian times, an attractive girl was one whose waist measurement in inches was the same as her age at her last birthday. To achieve this goal many young ladies were forced to sleep in their tightly laced corsets, as well as wear them throughout the day. In historical periods when the crinoline was fashionable, the restrictions on the waist could be eased considerably, because, of course, any waist looked small by comparison with the enormous apparent hip width provided by the huge skirts.

Twentieth-century waists have suffered much less from the artificial compressions of the corset, and frequently have been completely free of them, relying instead on the ‘compressions’ of a rigid diet. The average British woman of today has a waist measurement of 27¾ inches. The model girl Twiggy, the typical Playboy ‘playmate’ and the average Miss World all have a 24-inch waist. Modern female athletes, making more masculine demands on their bodies, tend towards a 29-inch waist.

These figures acquire more meaning when they are related to the bust and hip measurements, thereby revealing the ‘waist indentation’ factor that transmits the essential female contour signal. Twiggy (30½–24–33) and Miss World (36–24–36) now part company, the latter sending out a much more powerful waist signal.

There is a further waist factor that requires comment. Indentation comes from both above and below, and one can be greater than the other. Miss World is perfectly balanced – from both bust to waist and hip to waist, she indents by 12 inches. The average British female, however (37–27¾–39), goes in more from hip to waist than she does from bust to waist. The fact that her hips are two inches larger than her bust gives her what is called a 2-inch ‘drop’. This is common in the average female of other Western countries as well. In Italy it is also 2 inches; in Germany and Switzerland it is 2⅜ inches; in Sweden and France, 3⅛ inches.

These figures show a marked and significant difference from the Playboy ‘playmate’, a typical example being 37–24–35: in other words, a 2-inch ‘rise’, rather than a ‘drop’. That she is referred to as being ‘big-bosomed’ is therefore not merely a reflection of her breast size. Her bust measurement is exactly the same as that of the average British female. Her apparent ‘bustiness’ is more the result of the fact that, although her bust measurement is no bigger, both her waist and hip measurements are roughly four inches smaller, giving her a top-heavy contour which magnetically draws attention to her breasts. To find such an unusual female is not easy. Since, for the purposes of the magazine, the girl is to be photographed with her breasts naked, the problem is a strictly biological one – artificial aids cannot help her. To consider this more fully, we can now leave the waist behind and concentrate more specifically on the chest region.

The breasts. The adult female of the human species is unique amongst primates in possessing a pair of swollen, hemispherical mammary glands. These remain protuberant and swollen even when she is not producing milk and are clearly more than a mere feeding device. I have suggested that, in their shape, they can better be thought of as another mimic of a primary sexual zone; in other words, as biologically developed copies of the hemispherical buttocks. This gives the female a powerful sexual signal when she is standing vertically, in the uniquely human posture, and facing a male.

There are two other echoes of the basic buttock shape, but they are less powerful than the breast signals. One is the smooth, rounded shoulder of the female, which, if it is ‘only just’ exposed by the pulling down of a blouse or sweater, presents a suitably curved hemisphere of flesh. This is a common erotic device in periods of low-cut dresses. The other echo is found in the smooth, rounded knees of the female, which, when the legs are bent and pressed together, present another pair of feminine hemispheres to the eyes of the male. Again, knees have frequently been referred to in an erotic context. As with the shoulders, they make their greatest impact when they are ‘only just’ exposed by the skirt. If the whole leg is visible, some of their impact is lost because they then become merely the rounded ends of the thighs, rather than a pair of hemispheres in their own right. But these are much milder buttock-echoes, and it is with the breasts that the major impact is achieved.

It is important to distinguish here between the childhood reaction to the female breast and the adult sexual one. Most men see their interest in the female bosom as purely sexual. By contrast, some scientific theorists have viewed it as purely infantile. Both views are one-eyed, because both factors are operating. The male lover who kisses the nipple of his female’s breast may well be harking back to the pleasures of infancy, rather than kissing a pseudo-buttock, but the amorous male who ogles or fondles a female’s breasts may well be responding primarily to their hemispherical buttock shape, rather than reliving the feeling of his mother’s breast with his infantile hand. To the tiny hand of an infant, the mother’s breast is too vast an object to be cupped or clasped in the palm, but to the adult hand it presents a rounded surface remarkably reminiscent of the buttock hemisphere. Visually the same is true, a pair of breasts offering an image that is much closer to that of a pair of buttocks than to the looming shape seen at close quarters by a baby being suckled.

This sexual significance of the female breasts is therefore of primary importance to our species, and although this is not the whole story, it plays a major role in society’s perennial preoccupation with the feminine bosom. For the early English Puritans it meant flattening the breasts completely with a tight bodice. In seventeenth-century Spain, the measures taken were even more severe, young ladies having lead plates pressed into their swelling bosoms in an attempt to prevent their development. Such steps do not, of course, indicate a lack of interest in the female breast, which could only be demonstrated by completely ignoring it. Rather, they show acceptance of the fact that sexual signals do come from this region and, for cultural reasons, have to be stopped.

A much more widespread and frequent tendency has been for the breasts to be emphasized in some way. This emphasis has nearly always been to make them not so much larger as more upstanding. In other words, the tendency has been to improve their hemispherical, pseudo-buttock appearance. They are pushed up by tight dresses, so that they bulge above them, or they are pushed together to make the cleavage between them more like that between the real buttocks, or they are clasped in stretched brassières so that they protrude forward instead of sagging down. At some points in history, even greater attention has been paid to the problem, an ancient Indian love manual advising that ‘Continuous treatment with antimony and rice water will cause the breasts of a young girl to become large and prominent so that they will steal the heart of the connoisseur as a robber steals gold.’

In a few primitive cultures, however, sagging or drooping breasts do find favour, and young girls are encouraged to pull at them regularly in order to hasten their downward turn. Also, nearer home, the small-breasted, or even flat-chested, female has her ardent followers, and these exceptions to the general rule require explanation. The social anthropologist would probably merely put them down to ‘cultural variations’ and leave the matter there. Every culture and every period has its own special standards of beauty, he would say, and virtually anything goes, providing it becomes the accepted fashion for a particular tribe or society. There is no basic biological theme with variations, but merely a wide range of equally valid alternatives, and each one must be looked at on its own merits. But to take such a view is to beg the fundamental issue of why the adult male and female human animals have evolved so many different body details, differences which are typical for our species as a whole. The typical female does have swollen breasts which are lacking in the male, she does display them regardless of the presence or absence of milk production for her offspring, and other species of primate do lack this prominent visual feature. They do therefore present a basic biological theme for Homo sapiens, variations from which must be viewed as unusual and requiring special explanation, rather than simply as equally valid cultural alternatives that require none, except to say that they are ‘differing tribal customs’.

To understand the exceptions, it helps to look at the ‘life cycle’ of a typical female breast. In the child it starts out as no more than a nipple on a flat chest. Then, at puberty, it swells into a breast-bud. At this stage the swelling points straight forward. As it grows and becomes heavier, its weight begins to pull it down, its underside becoming slightly more curved than its upper surface. The nipples, however, still project straight out in front. This is the condition of the older teenage girl. Then, as she moves into her twenties and the breast continues to swell, it slowly begins to turn downwards until, in middle age, a full-breasted female shows a marked sag if she does not employ some artificial booster device. There are, then, three basic stages: small for the immature girl, pointed and protuberant for the young adult, and drooping for the older adult.

Viewed in this light, the cultural variations begin to make more sense. If, for some reason, immature girls are thought of as sexually appealing, then small breasts will be favoured. If older women are preferred, then drooping breasts will be in fashion. For the vast majority, the intermediate stage will be preferred, since it represents the true phase of first sexual activity in the human female. Underdeveloped females will imitate the pointed, protuberant condition by padding their small bosoms, the older ones who wish to give the impression of being in the first bloom of sexual life will imitate it by adding an artificial up :hrust.

In cases where pseudo-immature girls are preferred, there are several possible explanations. For the male living in a sexually repressed, puritan culture, flattening the female breast helps to damp down the strong sexual signal. For the male who has a strong inclination to play the ‘father’ role to a ‘daughter’ bride, the little-girl look of small breasts will be appealing. For the latent homosexual, small breasts give a more boyish look, which will be strongly attractive. Going to the other extreme, in societies where the maternal role of the female has become culturally much more important than the sexual one, the sagging breasts of the older female will be more appealing, even in younger girls. The latter must then ‘age’ their breasts by pulling at them to make them hang down.

For the majority of human beings, however, the maximum breast-appeal will come at the point where the hemispheres have reached their fullest protrusion before becoming so large that they begin to droop downwards. This explains the dilemma of the Playboy photographer, for as one breast quality (increased size) grows, the other (non-droop) diminishes. To take a picture of a super-breast, he has to search for a rare girl who has retained the firmness of her young breast past the point where it has already swollen to a full adult size. It is interesting that this limits him to a narrow age range in the late teens. Clearly this is the most vital point in the life cycle for this type of sexual signalling, and is the phase which older females are attempting to imitate and artificially prolong with their various breast-supporting techniques.

The super-breast effect is indirectly enhanced by selecting girls with modest-sized waists and hips. Here we come back to the question of the more general change in female body contour that occurs with age. Tests have shown that the average adult female puts on three pounds in weight every five years. The small proportion of this that goes on the breasts is what continues to pull them down as the years pass. The hips and thighs get an unfair share of this increase, giving the middle-aged female her characteristic ‘hippy’ (in the old sense) appearance. This is what accounts for the ‘drop’ mentioned earlier – the slightly larger size of hip than bust measurement. In some parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean region, this change can occur with startling rapidity as girls pass through their twenties. At one moment they are slim and slender and then, almost overnight, they start swelling out in the pelvic region, to assume the typical ‘maternal’ shape of the older woman. In other regions the change is more gradual, but the basic trend is the same. Not until very old age is there a reversal, when the body starts to shrink again.

To many Western women who wish to stay young-looking, this natural biological tendency of the species presents a severe challenge and demands the constant agonies of diet control. It is not merely that they are fighting gluttony, they are fighting nature as well. They must not merely eat ‘normally’, they must deliberately undereat, if they are to retain their girlish figures. The situation has not always been as extreme as it is today. In the past, a plumply rounded adult female figure has been perfectly acceptable sexually. There is nothing unfeminine about ample curves. They do, however, signal the maternal rather than the virginal phase, and the modern woman, under the influence of the contemporary youth-cult, wishes to remain a flesh-virgin, even while she copulates and bears children.

That the plump curves of the adult female are essentially linked to the maternal, rather than the courting, phase of life, is borne out by the fact that for every seven pounds a married woman with a child puts on, an unmarried woman only gains two pounds. The moral of this is that if a female wishes to remain girl-shaped, she should retain girl-status. Being unmarried, regardless of age, means that, biologically speaking, she is still displaying to a potential mate and therefore tends to stay the shape that has evolved to fit such a context. Once she becomes married, she begins to slip into the more ‘comfortable’ maternal shape, and her body contour starts to signal this new condition.

Although this trend is viewed by most modern women as merely a nuisance, it is too basic to be an accident. In biological terms it must have some value. One reason often given for it is that the plump, broad-hipped woman is a better child-bearer, but there seems to be little evidence to support this, especially as most of the added pelvic width consists not of a broader spacing of the bones that surround the birth-passage, but of heavy layers of fat. (The average human female body contains 28 per cent fat, the average male only 15 per cent.) There is another, more sexual explanation that seems to make better sense. The slender-girl shape is the one men enjoy visually – stare at, touch lightly, kiss, and fall in love with. The fuller, more womanly shape is the one they spend years copulating with. Perhaps, then, what happens is that the ideal visual shape changes to become the ideal tactile body, the ‘dancing gazelle’ becoming a cushion of ‘pneumatic bliss’. Such a change would certainly explain the difference between the bony fashion model, who is to be seen but not touched, and the full-bodied female, who is to be embraced and hugged, and has already completed her biological task of attracting and becoming bonded with an adult male.

I am dealing here, of course, with extremes. In the case of the average female, the girlish body is not so bony as to be unpleasant to copulate with, and the womanly body is not so full as to be uneasy on the eye. The change is only a minor one, and both stages are successful in both a visual and a tactile sense. What has gone wrong is that modern society has swallowed the romantic myth that young lovers stay dreamily in love for ever, year in and year out, with the maximum intensity of the pair-formation stage lasting permanently, even after the pair has become fully bonded. Instead of accepting that the state of being crazily ‘in love’ must inevitably mature into a condition of deep but less violent ‘loving’, the married couple struggle to maintain the breathless ardour of their first contacts, and the physical contours that went with them. When, as must happen, they sense the initial intensity slackening, they imagine that something must have gone wrong and feel let down. In retrospect, those early Hollywood movies may have a lot to answer for.

Body skin. For both sexes and in all cultures, a smooth, clean, disease-free skin has a major sexual significance. Wrinkles, dirt and skin diseases are always anti-erotic. (The deliberately scarred or tattooed skin that occurs in some cultures is a different matter and adds to rather than detracts from the owner’s sex appeal.)

In addition, the female body and limb skin is less hairy than that of the male, so that she not only attempts to increase its smoothness by the use of oils, lotions and massage, but also depilates it in a variety of ways, to exaggerate the sexual difference. Depilation has been used in many cultures and for thousands of years. It was practised, not only by certain ‘primitive’ tribes, but also in particular by the ancient Greeks, where women went so far as to remove much of the pubic hair as well, this being done either by tugging the hairs out manually – ‘myrtle bunches pulled out by the hand’, to quote one classical author – or by singeing them off with a burning lamp or hot ashes.

In modern times, females have depilated themselves with electric or safety razors and, more recently, by chemical means. Beauty experts claim that 80 per cent of women in Britain are the possessors of ‘unwanted’ body hair, which, although far more sparse and light than the male equivalent, nevertheless makes them feel a shade too masculine for comfort. In addition to shaving and the application of hair-dissolving creams, lotions and aerosol sprays, the beauty advisers recommend several other alternatives, such as waxing, rubbing, plucking and electrolysis. Waxing involves heating a special wax until it can be applied to the skin as a soft mould which then hardens. Once it is firm, it is stripped away, pulling the small body hairs with it. This is essentially the same device as that used from early times by Arab women, except that in their case they used a thick syrup of equal parts of water and sugar, with lemon juice added. This was poured on to the offending skin and allowed to harden, then ripped off in a similar way.

At first sight it is surprising that modern males, so many of whom daily endure a long struggle to depilate their stubble-strewn faces, have never risked experimenting with anything beyond the traditional razor shave. At second sight, however, a hidden factor emerges. This is not cowardice, or lack of initiative, but the result of a paradoxical desire to appear bearded even when beardless. Shaving always leaves a masculine blue sheen to the lower face, a tell-tale ghost of the beard that was. If, with some new technique, the adult male beard could be banished for ever, so would that virile blue sheen, and the treated face would begin to look too feminine to please its owner. Instead, by the time he dies, the average clean-shaven man will have spent well over two thousand hours scraping and rubbing at his face – a high price to pay for so contradictory a signal.

During the intense phases of pre-copulatory and copulatory activity, the whole of the body-skin surface of both the male and the female undergoes considerable change in textural quality. It glows with heat and, at the point of orgasm, there may be profuse sweating. In erotically posed photographs, models are sometimes shown displaying these conditions as visual signals. The skin may be oiled or greased to make it shine, or sprayed with water to give the impression of profuse sweating. In such cases the water is not meant to be consciously thought of as sweat, the water is plainly water and the model can often be seen to be rising from a pool or a bath to prove it. It would be too direct a comment to make the skin look obviously sweaty. Instead, the dampened surface makes its impact by unconscious association. The same is true of the habit of using a high level of red in printing colour pictures. This gives the girl’s skin an erotic, flushed appearance, as though she is sexually overheated, and is a commonly used device in many magazines. Editorial requests to ‘have the red brought up’ do not, however, go so far that the viewer becomes consciously aware of what is being done.

Products have recently been marketed to produce an erotic skin glow artificially on a more private basis. Lovers can now cover themselves with various strange substances that make them look (and feel) as though they are in an advanced arousal condition before they have even begun to perform pre-copulatory contacts. For example, ‘Love Foam’ comes in aerosol cans. When it is sprayed on it looks rather like shaving cream, but when rubbed into the skin, according to the manufacturers, it makes the body ‘take on a magical glow’. For even more exotic tastes, there is a substance which goes by the colourful name of ‘Orgy Butter’. Called ‘The Luxury Lubricant’, it is advertised as ‘A bold, red warm body rub … Gives a slippery, sensual effect. Works into the skin with rubbing, providing an after-glow.’ Here, quite clearly, are the vital arousal signals – red/slippery/glow – once again mimicking the vaso-dilation and sweating of the real arousal state of the human body skin.

The shoulders. The rounded female shoulder has already been mentioned, but the larger male shoulder also deserves a comment. Width of shoulders becomes an important secondary sexual characteristic that starts to develop at puberty. The shoulders of the male adolescent widen out more extensively than those of the female, and by the time the young adult stage is reached the male is decidedly more broad-shouldered than his female companion. Like the other contour differences, this one has also been exaggerated artificially in various ways. Throughout history, male clothing has repeatedly involved an extra padding of the shoulder region, making it appear even larger as a masculine signal. The extreme situation is reached with the military epaulet, which not only makes the shoulders appear wider but also makes them much more angular. In this way they provide a double contrast with the narrower and more rounded shoulders of the female, and completely lose their hemispherical visual quality.

The jaw. There are several important sexual differences in the head region, and the first of these concerns the jaw and chin. The average human male has a slightly heavier jaw and chin region than the average female. For some reason this fact is seldom commented on, and yet it remains the one certain give-away clue in the case of an otherwise perfectly disguised male transvestite or female impersonator. Such men can pad out their body contours, depilate all visible areas of skin, cover their faces in heavy make-up, have wax injections to give themselves artificial breasts, and generally present such an alluring female appearance that occasionally a sailor in a foreign port has found himself, rather late in the transaction, involved with a ‘female’ prostitute who is not all that ‘she’ at first seemed to be. But even the very best of transvestites can do nothing about his jaw and chin, short of major surgery. Unless, by chance, he happens to be an abnormally small-jawed male, he will always present a tell-tale, heavy-jowled appearance to a discerning eye.

In some races, especially in the Far East, the extra heaviness of the male jaw and chin is less pronounced, and it is significant that in these same races there is typically a much less marked beard growth. It seems as if there is a connection between these two features. Jutting the jaw forward, by either sex, is an aggressive act – an intention movement of thrusting forward into the attack. It is the opposite of the submissive lowering of the head that occurs during a meek bowing action. The male, by having a more powerful jaw, is, so to speak, performing a permanent assertive jut. That this is important as a masculine trait is borne out by the fact that males who have receding chins are sometimes sneered at as ‘chinless wonders’, implying that they lack the normal male assertiveness.

Since one of the most obvious masculine characteristics of our species is the possession of a beard, it seems highly probable that this evolved in company with the more jutting jaw, the heavier bony structure providing a better base for the hairs, and the two features together producing a maximum virile jut. The peculiar chin of our species is important here. Unlike other primates, we have an outward protuberance of bone in the chin region, a protuberance which anatomists have now decided has no internal mechanical function. In the past, many theories have been put forward to explain this unique human feature, relating it to special properties of the jaw muscles and the tongue, but all of these arguments have recently been demolished. Instead, our chin jut is now accepted as primarily a signal feature and, as such, it must be seen as one that underlies the assertive jutting of the male beard.

The cheeks. Moving up the face and avoiding the mouth, which was dealt with earlier, we come to the cheeks. Here the most important signal is the blush, a reddening of the skin caused by vaso-congestion. This always starts in the cheek region, where it is most obvious, and may then spread to cover the whole of the face, the neck and, in some cases, the upper part of the trunk. Blushing is more common in females than males, and in young females than older ones. Accompanying the reddening there is a turgidity of the skin which takes on a surface glow that is visible even in a Negro blush. Blushing occurs in all human races and even in the deaf/blind, so that it appears to be a basic biological characteristic of the species. Darwin devoted a whole chapter to the subject of blushing and concluded that it reflected shyness, shame, or modesty, and indicated ‘self-attention to personal appearance’. Its sexual significance is illustrated by the fact that the records show that girls who blushed freely when being offered for sale in ancient slave-markets for use in harems fetched higher prices than those that did not. As an invitation to intimacy, whether desired or not, the blush seems to have been a powerful signal.

The eyes. The most important of human sense organs, these not only see all the various signals we have been examining, but also transmit some on their own account. We all make and break eye contacts repeatedly during face-to-face encounters, looking at people to check their changing moods and then looking away to avoid the threat of staring at them. Between lovers, however, the stare can become more prolonged without being disconcerting or aggressive. Lovers ‘gaze deeply into one another’s eyes’ for a particular reason. Under the influence of strong emotions of a pleasant kind, our pupils dilate to an unusual degree, the small dark spot in the centre of the eye becoming a great black disc. Unconsciously, this transmits a powerful signal to the loved one, indicating the intensity of the love felt by the dilator. This fact has only recently been studied scientifically, but it has been known for centuries, Italian beauties of earlier days having placed drops of belladonna into their eyes in order to create the effect artificially. In modern times a similar device has been used by advertisers, who, using black ink instead of belladonna, have touched up photographs of model girls, enlarging their pupils to make them more appealing.

Another change that takes place in the eyes when emotions run high is a slight increase in tear production. In an intensely loving condition this does not usually go to the extreme of producing tears that actually start to run from the eye, but merely gives the eye surface an increased glistening quality. These are the shining eyes of love, and combine with the pupil dilation to leave no doubt about the condition of the signaller.

Eye movements of various kinds also invite intimacy. Apart from the well-known wink, the rolling of the eyes is also reported to be a direct invitation to copulation in certain cultures. A demure dropping of the eyes also transmits its message in the female, while a slight narrowing of them can indicate interest on the part of a male. When making a first encounter, the holding of a glance slightly longer than is usual can also make an impact, acting as a hint, so to speak, of the deep gazing that may develop later.

A wide-eyed, or magnified, stare is sometimes employed by a female inviting intimacy, and associated with this is the feminine device of fluttering the eyelashes or batting the eyelids. The word ‘bat’ used in this connection is a modification of ‘bate’, which means a beating of wings, and, in our culture at least, is a decidedly non-masculine action, so much so that it is sometimes used by a male when he is mockingly imitating a female gesture. Perhaps because eyelash movements of this kind are so essentially feminine, a great deal of lash exaggeration is practised by females at the present time. This began with the use of mascara, to make the eyelashes look heavier and more conspicuous, then moved on to eyelash curlers, and finally, in the 1960s, culminated with the development of sets of long artificial lashes which were added to the real ones. Today, one company alone offers no less than fifteen different styles of artificial eyelashes, including ‘Wispy-tipped Starry Lashes’ that ‘open up eyes’ and ‘Raggedy Lashes’ that ‘enlarge small eyes’. These are fixed to the upper eyelids, as are such exotic concoctions as ‘Cluster-lashes’, ‘Natural-fluff Lashes’ and ‘Super-sweepers’. For the lower eyelid, there are ‘Winged Under-lashes’ to ‘widen, brighten eyes’. As in so many other parts of the body, when the female has something that sends out an important feminine signal, she makes the most of it. This new trend to exaggerate the eyelash region would certainly provide a feast for an amorous male Trobriander, who, as an important part of his love-making, regularly bites off the lashes of his loved one. Luckily for the latter, eyelashes grow remarkably quickly, each one only lasting for three to five months even in the unbitten condition.

The eyebrows. Above the eyes the human animal possesses two unique patches of hair at the bottom of an otherwise hairless forehead. The eyebrows were once thought to operate as devices for stopping the sweat running down into the eyes, but their basic function is that of signalling changing moods. They are raised in fear and surprise and lowered in anger, knitted together in anxiety and cocked in a questioning glance. At the moment of a friendly acknowledgment they are flicked quickly once up and down.

The eyebrows of the female are less thick and bushy than those of the male, so, once again, they are available for exaggeration to make a female condition more feminine. They have frequently been plucked to make them thinner, and in the 1930s they were reduced to a mere pencil line. Even this extreme was exceeded in earlier days, however, Japanese brides once going so far as to shave them off altogether at the time of their marriage.

The sexual nature of this comparatively trivial modification to the female appearance is well illustrated by the fact that, in 1933, a girl who applied for a post as a nurse in a London hospital was warned by the matron that, amongst other things, she would not be permitted to continue plucking her eyebrows. A complaint was made, her case was taken up, and the London County Council was urged to give the matron an official rebuke, but the request was refused. The hospital patients were therefore spared the undue stimulation of a sensuously plucked eyebrow, and unmodified female shapes continued to glide through the long white corridors.

The face. Before leaving the facial region, it is worth taking a last glance at it as a whole, rather than as a set of smaller details. It is, without any doubt, the most expressive region of the entire human body, capable of transmitting incredibly varied and subtle emotional messages by means of its complex expressions. By contracting and relaxing the special muscles, particularly those around the mouth and eyes, we can signal everything from joy and surprise to sadness and anger. As a device for inviting intimacy, this is of major importance. A face that is soft and smiling, or alert and excited, attracts us strongly. One that is forlorn and helpless, or in agony, may also stimulate us to approach and console. A tense, hard or grumpy face has the opposite effect. This is common enough knowledge, but there is an interesting long-term effect that operates on the human face, and which deserves brief comment.

Where facial expressions are concerned, we can speak of an ‘on-face’ and an ‘off-face’. The on-face is the one we use during social encounters. We speak of ‘putting on a happy face’, or ‘putting a good face on it’, and we try to avoid ‘losing face’ in public. If we want to appear friendly, we adopt a soft, smiling expression. Alternatively, we set our faces into a grim or pompous look to cope with more serious occasions. When we are alone and unseen, however, we let our faces go off-duty. When this happens they arrange themselves into the posture typical of our overall long-term mood. The basically anxiety-ridden man, who tried his best to look happy at the party, now tenses up his solitary face, revealing his true emotional condition, but revealing it, of course, to no one but himself. (Unless he catches sight of himself in a mirror, even he may not be aware of it.) The basically happy and contented man, who tried his best to look sad and serious at the funeral, now relaxes his solitary face, with his lips softened and the furrows in his brow smoothed out.

Most of us change our long-term moods from time to time, so that our facial muscles do not experience prolonged exposure to one particular off-face condition. We may feel depressed in the morning but happy again by the evening, and in our solitary moments our facial postures will vary accordingly. For individuals who live in a state of more or less permanent private anxiety, depression or anger, the situation is different. For them, there is a danger that their off-faces will become completely set. In such instances, the facial musculature seems to become moulded in one basic expression. The crease lines on the forehead, around the mouth and at the side of the nose become almost permanent.

Such people find it hard to switch to the appropriate on-face during social encounters. The anxious person still looks anxious even when smiling a greeting. The grumpy man still looks grumpy even when laughing at a joke. The set of the muscles somehow survives and the on-face becomes superimposed on the off-face, rather than replacing it. In this way, facial expressions can tell us something about a person’s past as well as his present emotional condition.

It is not clear how long these off-face wrinkles will last after there has been a fundamental change in a way of life. If someone who has been anxious and worried all his life suddenly achieves a contented condition, the wrinkles will not vanish overnight. If the person in question is elderly when this welcome change occurs, they may never fade. Certainly, in all such cases there will be a period of time when the old set-face will be lingering on despite the fact that its message is no longer relevant, but I know of no studies in which the length of this period has been measured.

These comments also apply, incidentally, to the general body posture of the human being. There are slumped bodies and alert bodies, stiffly tense bodies and softly lithe ones. Again, we are capable of changing our body-muscle tensions to match our social moods and occasions, but, as with the face, a prolonged, extreme condition can give us a set posture that is difficult to shake off even when we want to. Rounded shoulders can develop into a permanent hunch that even winning a million cannot straighten out, and a tense stiff-legged walk can become a companion for life.

The hair. Finally we reach man’s crowning glory, his densely packed mop of roughly 100,000 head-hairs. In some races these are woolly or frizzy, in others they hang down long and straight, or flow in the wind. They grow at a rate of nearly five inches a year, and each one lasts up to six years before it falls out and is replaced. This means that the average uncut head of straight hair would reach down to the hips, and must have given an unbarbered, primitive human being an extraordinary appearance, when compared with any other species of primate. While our body hair became stunted and almost invisible at a distance, our head hair ran amok.

Apart from the fact that older males, but not older females, tend to become bald in many cases, there is no sex difference in the head hair. Biologically, both men and women are long-haired, and this characteristic has developed as a species recognition signal, rather than a sexual one. Culturally, however, it has frequently been modified as a gender signal. Sometimes men have worn longer hair than women, but usually the reverse has been the case. In recent centuries, masculine hair has been cropped basically as an anti-parasite device, aggressive army sergeants referring to long male hairs as ‘louse-ladders’. Women have nearly always maintained a moderate hair length; it is the men who have fluctuated wildly from one extreme to the other. In the past this has sometimes led to the wearing of huge, drooping male wigs, a practice still seen today in the case of British judges. In general, however, the longer locks of recent times have become so firmly associated with the female sex that for a man to wear his hair in anything remotely approaching its natural length has been quite wrongly viewed as essentially feminine. During the last decade this situation has changed dramatically amongst young males, and hair length seems once again to be re-establishing itself in its truly non-sexual role. It is perhaps ironic that, although it is modern hygiene that has made this so much less of a parasite risk, it is the anti-hygiene hippie movement that has taken the lead.

Cleaning, grooming, washing and oiling the hair has always been an important accompaniment to its cultural use as a sexual signal. Ancient urbanites, like their modern counterparts, were prepared to go to great lengths to obtain the desired effect. The oldest known hair tonic consisted of ‘Paws of a dog, one part; kernels of dates, one part; hoof of a donkey, one part. Cook thoroughly with oil and anoint.’ Today, glistening, gleaming, swishing hair remains almost every girl’s ideal and, as the advertisers repeatedly tell us, hair that is ‘dull and lifeless’ ruins its owner’s chances of inviting intimacy.

In this grand tour of the signalling human body the different parts have been taken one by one, but there is still the whole person to be considered. The isolated parts are displayed not singly but all at once, in a general combination and in a specific context. It is the tremendously varied way in which they can combine with one another, and the great range of contexts in which they can be presented, that makes social interaction so complex and so fascinating. Every time we enter a room, or walk down a street, we are transmitting a mass of signals, some purely biological and others culturally modified, and we are always unconsciously aware of this fact and adjusting them in a hundred subtle ways as we move through our many kinds of social encounter. Nearly always we are striving to send out a balanced set of signals, some attracting intimacy, others repelling it. Just occasionally we go much further in one direction or the other, either displaying our invitations blatantly, or presenting ourselves in a hostile, rejecting manner to those around us.

Throughout this chapter, in surveying the various visual invitations to sexual intimacy, I have tended to dwell on extremes. I have selected the most vivid examples in order to underline the points I have been making. Codpieces, corsets and epaulets may seem remote from the ordinary signals of sex appeal used by the average adult of today, but they nevertheless help to draw our attention to the less exaggerated devices – the tight trousers, the belts and the padded shoulders – that are more widely and less obviously employed. Similarly, belly-dancing may be no more than an exotic form of entertainment, but again its inclusion in this survey helps us to appreciate the less extreme dance movements used nightly by hundreds of thousands of ordinary girls at parties and discotheques.

Whether, as adults, we go to great lengths to improve and display our visual signals of sex appeal, or whether we treat the whole business in a more off-hand manner, whether we resort to artificial aids (and there are few of us who do not employ some), or whether we scorn them and prefer a more ‘natural’ approach, we are all of us constantly transmitting a complex set of visual signals to our companions. Many of these signals inevitably have to do with our adult sexual qualities, and even when we are totally unaware of what we are doing, we never stop ‘reading the signs’. In this way we prepare ourselves for a major social step – the step that leads us to initiate the first tentative contact with a potential sexual partner and carries us over a vital threshold into the whole complex world of sexual intimacy itself.
