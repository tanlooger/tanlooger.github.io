title: Middleware
---



Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.



Middleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See Matching Paths for more details.



Convention

Use the file middleware.ts (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as pages or app, or inside src if applicable.



Example

middleware.ts



TypeScript


```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))

}

 

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more

export const config = {

  matcher: '/about/:path*',

}
```

Matching Paths

Middleware will be invoked for every route in your project. The following is the execution order:



headers from next.config.js

redirects from next.config.js

Middleware (rewrites, redirects, etc.)

beforeFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js

Filesystem routes (public/, _next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)

afterFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js

Dynamic Routes (/blog/[slug])

fallback (rewrites) from next.config.js

There are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:



Custom matcher config

Conditional statements

Matcher

matcher allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.



middleware.js


```
export const config = {

  matcher: '/about/:path*',

}
```

You can match a single path or multiple paths with an array syntax:



middleware.js


```
export const config = {

  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],

}
```

The matcher config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:



middleware.js


```
export const config = {

  matcher: [

    /*

     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:

     * - api (API routes)

     * - _next/static (static files)

     * - _next/image (image optimization files)

     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)

     */

    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',

  ],

}
```

Good to know: The matcher values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.



Configured matchers:



MUST start with /

Can include named parameters: /about/:path matches /about/a and /about/b but not /about/a/c

Can have modifiers on named parameters (starting with :): /about/:path* matches /about/a/b/c because * is zero or more. ? is zero or one and + one or more

Can use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: /about/(.*) is the same as /about/:path*

Read more details on path-to-regexp documentation.



Good to know: For backward compatibility, Next.js always considers /public as /public/index. Therefore, a matcher of /public/:path will match.



Conditional Statements

middleware.ts



TypeScript


```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {

    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))

  }

 

  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {

    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))

  }

}
```

NextResponse

The NextResponse API allows you to:



redirect the incoming request to a different URL

rewrite the response by displaying a given URL

Set request headers for API Routes, getServerSideProps, and rewrite destinations

Set response cookies

Set response headers

To produce a response from Middleware, you can:



rewrite to a route (Page or Route Handler) that produces a response

return a NextResponse directly. See Producing a Response

Using Cookies

Cookies are regular headers. On a Request, they are stored in the Cookie header. On a Response they are in the Set-Cookie header. Next.js provides a convenient way to access and manipulate these cookies through the cookies extension on NextRequest and NextResponse.



For incoming requests, cookies comes with the following methods: get, getAll, set, and delete cookies. You can check for the existence of a cookie with has or remove all cookies with clear.

For outgoing responses, cookies have the following methods get, getAll, set, and delete.

middleware.ts



TypeScript


```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  // Assume a "Cookie:nextjs=fast" header to be present on the incoming request

  // Getting cookies from the request using the `RequestCookies` API

  let cookie = request.cookies.get('nextjs')

  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }

  const allCookies = request.cookies.getAll()

  console.log(allCookies) // => [{ name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast' }]

 

  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => true

  request.cookies.delete('nextjs')

  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => false

 

  // Setting cookies on the response using the `ResponseCookies` API

  const response = NextResponse.next()

  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')

  response.cookies.set({

    name: 'vercel',

    value: 'fast',

    path: '/',

  })

  cookie = response.cookies.get('vercel')

  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'vercel', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }

  // The outgoing response will have a `Set-Cookie:vercel=fast;path=/test` header.

 

  return response

}
```

Setting Headers

You can set request and response headers using the NextResponse API (setting request headers is available since Next.js v13.0.0).



middleware.ts



TypeScript


```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-hello-from-middleware1`

  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)

  requestHeaders.set('x-hello-from-middleware1', 'hello')

 

  // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.rewrite

  const response = NextResponse.next({

    request: {

      // New request headers

      headers: requestHeaders,

    },

  })

 

  // Set a new response header `x-hello-from-middleware2`

  response.headers.set('x-hello-from-middleware2', 'hello')

  return response

}
```

Good to know: Avoid setting large headers as it might cause 431 Request Header Fields Too Large error depending on your backend web server configuration.



Producing a Response

You can respond from Middleware directly by returning a Response or NextResponse instance. (This is available since Next.js v13.1.0)



middleware.ts



TypeScript


```
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

import { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth'

 

// Limit the middleware to paths starting with `/api/`

export const config = {

  matcher: '/api/:function*',

}

 

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  // Call our authentication function to check the request

  if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {

    // Respond with JSON indicating an error message

    return Response.json(

      { success: false, message: 'authentication failed' },

      { status: 401 }

    )

  }

}
```

Advanced Middleware Flags

In v13.1 of Next.js two additional flags were introduced for middleware, skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize and skipTrailingSlashRedirect to handle advanced use cases.



skipTrailingSlashRedirect allows disabling Next.js default redirects for adding or removing trailing slashes allowing custom handling inside middleware which can allow maintaining the trailing slash for some paths but not others allowing easier incremental migrations.



next.config.js


```
module.exports = {

  skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,

}

middleware.js



const legacyPrefixes = ['/docs', '/blog']

 

export default async function middleware(req) {

  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl

 

  if (legacyPrefixes.some((prefix) => pathname.startsWith(prefix))) {

    return NextResponse.next()

  }

 

  // apply trailing slash handling

  if (

    !pathname.endsWith('/') &&

    !pathname.match(/((?!\.well-known(?:\/.*)?)(?:[^/]+\/)*[^/]+\.\w+)/)

  ) {

    req.nextUrl.pathname += '/'

    return NextResponse.redirect(req.nextUrl)

  }

}
```

skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize allows disabling the URL normalizing Next.js does to make handling direct visits and client-transitions the same. There are some advanced cases where you need full control using the original URL which this unlocks.



next.config.js


```
module.exports = {

  skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize: true,

}

middleware.js



export default async function middleware(req) {

  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl

 

  // GET /_next/data/build-id/hello.json

 

  console.log(pathname)

  // with the flag this now /_next/data/build-id/hello.json

  // without the flag this would be normalized to /hello

}
```
