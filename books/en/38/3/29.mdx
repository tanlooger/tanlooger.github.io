TWO days later, she was called into Dr. Lewison’s office. Dr. Keller was there. Ashley was to be discharged and would return to her home in Cupertino, where regular therapy and evaluation sessions had been arranged with a court-approved psychiatrist.

Dr. Lewison said, “Well, today’s the day. Are you excited?”

Ashley said, “I’m excited, I’m frightened, I’m—I don’t know. I feel like a bird that’s just been set free. I feel like I’m flying.” Her face was glowing.

“I’m glad you’re leaving, but I’m—I’m going to miss you,” Dr. Keller said.

She walked into Pennsylvania Station. It was the busiest train station in America, a charmless maze of airless rooms and passages. The station was crowded with people. And each person has an interesting story to tell, she thought. They’re all going to different places, living their own lives, and now, I’m going to live my own life.

She purchased a ticket from one of the machines. Her train was just pulling in. Serendipity, she thought.

She boarded the train and took a seat. She was filled with excitement at what was about to happen. The train gave a jerk and then started picking up speed. I’m on my way at last. And as the train headed toward the Hamptons, she began to sing softly:

“All around the mulberry bush,

The monkey chased the weasel.

The monkey thought ’twas all in fun,

Pop! goes the weasel…”
