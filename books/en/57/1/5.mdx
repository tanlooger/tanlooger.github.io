title: 5 The Wars of Russian Assertion
---



The First Chechen War was a disaster for the Russian army. It had been outsmarted and outfought, even losing cities to a ramshackle guerrilla army. It had been clumsy and brutal. All the inefficiencies, brutality and corruption of the army had been put on public display, not least thanks to a critical media that chronicled its failings. It also contributed to a massive public backlash against the military and a further spike in draft dodging. The Russian military was left at the very lowest ebb of its fortunes and credibility. And morale: Gen. Rokhlin, one of the few commanders who had genuinely distinguished himself in Chechnya, refused to accept the Hero of Russia, saying: ‘The war in Chechnya is not Russia’s glory, but its misfortune.’1

Yeltsin, never a man to pass up on a good scapegoat, had sacked Grachyov and also forced the resignation of FSK security service chief Sergei Stepashin and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin. Grachyov’s successor, the acerbic Rodionov, did not last long in the position: his frustration with what he saw as the government’s refusal to fund the military properly (‘what kind of “@*/?!” reforms are you talking about? We are starving!’ he exploded at a reception in 1997 to military journalist Pavel Felgenhauer2 ) combined with a resistance to subordinating the military to a new – and short-lived – Defence Council and its secretary, Yuri Baturin, who he felt was wilfully short-changing them. In May 1997, less than a year after taking office, Rodionov was sacked and replaced by Gen. Igor Sergeyev, head of the Strategic Rocket Forces. As the price for his elevation, Sergeyev was much less outspoken, and devoted more of his efforts to protecting his old service than the armed forces as a whole. What this meant was that for most of the 1990s, the Russian military was led by political appointees more concerned with protecting their positions and appeasing Yeltsin than articulating some coherent vision for the country’s armed forces. They ended the decade scarcely any more reformed – just smaller – than when they had started.

Yet at the same time, they were being called on to protect the Motherland’s interests in a growing number of theatres. Beyond the Chechen war, they would be deployed in neighbouring post-Soviet states, as both peacekeepers and imperial enforcers, and even deployed into Yugoslavia during the civil war that tore it apart, prompting a military stand-off with US forces. This was a decade of living dangerously, in which Moscow tried to play the role of a great power, or at least a regional one, while its soldiers were underpaid, underfed, undervalued and undertrained. In many ways, what is striking is that they did as well as they did.



Moldova’s Post-Soviet Hangover

Why is there still a slice of the territory legally part of the Republic of Moldova, in which Russian is still the official language, and statues of Lenin still loom over the main squares? There was still an assumption in the Kremlin that Russia was the regional hegemon of what it called the ‘Near Abroad’ – the other post-Soviet states. I remember back in 1995, a Russian diplomat earnestly telling me that ‘we have no dispute with the sovereignty and independence of foreign nations; but these countries, they are hardly foreign, we feel they are still part of our family.’ Russia, he implied, was very much head of the household, and these countries’ freedom was only insofar as they did not challenge Moscow’s authority. It would exploit territorial disputes, historical grievances and inter-ethnic rivalries to force neighbours into line, especially by backing local minorities, often ethnic Russians, in their disputes with their governments. Encouraging or downright forcing Russian colonists to move to conquered territories was a measure applied first by the tsars and then, even more deliberately, by the Soviets. When the USSR was dissolved, there were more than 20 million ethnic Russians living outside the boundaries of the Russian Federation, something Putin would later call ‘a major geopolitical disaster of the century’.3 While many adapted, and simply acclimatized to their new nationalities, others felt marginalized or discriminated against, and these became allies or pretexts for Moscow’s meddling.

This was especially evident in Moldova, one of the smaller republics, sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania. Around three-quarters of the population are of Romanian heritage, and speak a language which is essentially Romanian. Just under 15% were ethnic Russians and other Slavs, disproportionately concentrated on a sliver of land on the east bank of the Dneistr River. As Party rule declined, in Moldova as elsewhere, nationalism rose in response. In 1989, the local authorities made Moldovan the main state language, relegating Russian to a secondary status, and abandoned the use of the Cyrillic alphabet. The Russians of what would become Transnistria, formally the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), became increasingly alarmed. Many did not want the USSR disbanded, seeing it as their protection against the Moldovans. In August 1990 they had actually declared independence even if, to be blunt, neither Moscow nor the Moldovan authorities in Chisinau paid much attention.

By winter 1991–92, Transnistrian militants were clashing sporadically with Moldovan police. In response, the government began forming a National Guard and then established a proper ministry of defence, and armed forces. These were based on elements of the Soviet 14th Guards Army that had been based in western Moldova, as well as an array of volunteers, reservists and conscripts.

The irony is that the 14th Army, which was headquartered in Tiraspol, east of the Dneistr, also became the key protector of the PMR. Although Moscow was officially neutral, many of the army’s officers and men either came from the region or sympathized with the rebels. Indeed, its commander, Lt. Gen. Gennady Yakovlev, made no secret of his support for them, and in December also accepted the role of chair of the PMR’s de facto defence minister. The Kremlin’s position was ambiguous. Shaposhnikov decided Yakovlev could not be both a PMR minister and a Russian commander and replaced him at the head of the 14th Army with the rather more neutral Lt. Gen. Yuri Netkachev. Still, though, weapons continued to flow out of the armouries of the 14th, and on 5 April 1992, Vice-President Rutskoi visited Tiraspol and encouraged the Transnistrians to seek their independence.

March and April had seen sporadic skirmishes along the eastern bank of the Dneistr, but the most serious fighting was to take place in the strategic city of Bender. Although largely populated by Russian-speakers, Bender is actually on the western bank, and on the main road from Chisinau to Tiraspol. Notionally controlled by the government, it was a constant source of instability, and when police arrested a Russian major from the 14th Army on suspicion of helping insurgents, it triggered a violent confrontation. Both sides sent forces into Bender, and the PMR’s Republican Guards were supported by T-64 tanks from the 14th Army. At least two were knocked out by Moldovan T-12 anti-tank guns, and left stranded in the street, their tell-tale Russian markings belying Moscow’s claims that its forces were keeping out of this fraternal spat.

As Moldovan troops pushed forward and looked about to take the bridge over the Dneistr, Tiraspol threw all the forces it could muster into Bender, including armed Cossack volunteers from Russia and eastern Ukraine. Slowly, they pushed back into Bender amidst vicious house-to-house fighting. The 14th Army seems to have played no more than a supporting role in this fighting, but Chisinau was convinced that the only reason why its forces were not in retreat was because the Russian military was directly involved. Believing that the 14th Army was preparing to invade, it dispatched two of Moldova’s handful of flightworthy MiG-29 fighters (inherited from the Soviet 86th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment) to try to destroy the Bender Bridge: six OFAB-250 bombs were dropped, but none hit. Nonetheless, this was enough for the 14th Army to activate its air defences. The conflict was escalating.

Fearing that an internal struggle was going to turn into a war between Russia and Moldova, Yeltsin dispatched his national security adviser, the ex-paratrooper Alexander Lebed, to Tiraspol. His orders were to stop the fighting by whatever means necessary, and he adopted a characteristically ferocious approach. On arriving at the 14th Army headquarters, he relieved Netkachev and took personal command. Early in the morning of 3 July, massed fire from the army’s 4th Artillery Regiment – unguided 220mm rockets from BM-27 Uragans, 122mm shells from D-30 howitzers and 152mm rounds from several batteries of 2A36 Giatsint field guns – shattered Moldovan encampments around Bender.

Lebed had no real sympathy for either side. Possibly apocryphally, he is meant afterwards to have said, ‘I told the hooligans in Tiraspol and the fascists in Chisinau – either you stop killing each other, or else I’ll shoot the whole lot of you.’4 But he was there to make peace and, true to form, he was going to do so through superior firepower. The 14th Army was, by this stage, scarcely much larger than a division in strength, with around 14,000 effectives. Nonetheless, they were well armed, and not only did the bombardment effectively end the government’s push on Bender, but it raised the prospect that they would have to take on a combined force of PMR militia, volunteers and Russian troops that outnumbered Moldova’s still-forming army. At the same time, Lebed made it clear to the PMR leadership that the price for Russian protection was a peace deal, and on 21 July, Yeltsin signed a ceasefire agreement with his Moldovan counterpart, Mircea Snegur. This would be secured by a peacekeeping force of three battalions of Moldovan troops, two of PMR soldiers – and five from the 14th Army.

There would be sporadic clashes thereafter, but under the shadow of the 14th Army, the deal held, as it has to this day. Perhaps a thousand died all told, both civilians and combatants, and Moldova in effect lost the east bank of the Dneistr. In 1995, the 14th Army became the Operational Group of Russian Forces in Transnistria, and as of 2022, it is made up of maybe 1,500 men in two Independent Peacekeeping Motor Rifle battalions. But they are there as much as anything else as a token of Moscow’s continued commitment to maintaining the PMR, now a heavily criminalized and almost Soviet pseudo-state. It is not that the Kremlin really cares about the PMR and its people – rather, it is a symbol of its willingness to defend the interests of ethnic Russians in the ‘Near Abroad’ (when it suits) and a convenient base for political mischief in the region. The precedent Lebed set, the use of force to support convenient insurgents and create a ‘frozen conflict’ that permits Moscow to retain a foothold in post-Soviet neighbours, would be used repeatedly in the future, and helps demonstrate how the Russian military became and remains a key instrument of its foreign policy, too.

Central Asia: The Tajikistan Contingent

Likewise, another military unit became an instrument of Russian power in Central Asia. The 201st Gatchina Twice Red Banner Motor Rifle Division, which had taken part in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, had then been based in Tajikistan, with its headquarters in the country’s capital, Dushanbe. It was slated for withdrawal back to Russia, provisionally in September 1992, when civil war broke out in Tajikistan. Rebels would several times try to raid its bases for weapons and supplies, and many of the unit’s soldiers, who were conscripts drafted locally, simply deserted. The predominantly Russian officers held the unit together, though, and were reinforced with Spetsnaz in a bid by Moscow to maintain its operational status and use it to prop up what was admittedly an authoritarian Soviet-era government against rebels from minority ethnic groups and Islamic extremists, including radicals from Afghanistan.

Although officially just part of a CIS peacekeeping force, in practice the 201st became Moscow’s main agent in Tajikistan. When Dushanbe fell briefly to the rebels in late 1992, it played a crucial role in its recapture in December, providing heavy fire support for the pro-government security forces and militias from the Kulob region, from whence new Tajik leader Emomali Rahmon drew his main support. In 1993, the 201st was reinforced with the 41st Separate Helicopter Squadron equipped with Mi-24s, the 2nd Separate Rocket Artillery Battalion with Uragan MLRS and an aviation group based as Dushanbe airport. This reflected the broadening of its duties: as well as combating insurgents directly and interdicting attempts to cross the Tajik–Afghan border, it was now escorting vital convoys bringing food, medicines and military materiel to outlying cities. One officer of the 201st, who had served in Afghanistan, described it in 1992 as ‘eerily like Afgan, just without the rebels – so far’. His caution was justified, as the 201st became increasingly embroiled in fighting. In July 1993, as many as 250 Tajik and Afghan fighters tried to storm the 12th Outpost of the Border Troops assigned to Tajikistan. There were 47 Border Troops and one civilian at the outpost, but they held off the militants for 11 hours. The arrival of elements of the 201st Motor Rifle Division’s 149th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment ended the attack, which left 25 Russians and up to 70 militants dead.

The civil war would rage until 1997, and in that time the 201st would be brought up to full divisional strength – albeit largely by again recruiting Tajiks to serve under Russian officers – and would be embroiled in numerous raids and skirmishes. Peace was eventually achieved through a mediation process brokered by both Washington and Moscow, but when the guns fell silent it was nonetheless Russia that retained a crucial role in the country. Rahmon was in power, and remains so as of writing, atop a corrupt and heavy-handed regime maintained by a series of dubious elections.

Although in 1994 it was renamed the 201st Military Base, the division continues to prop up the government in Dushanbe and, by extension, maintain Moscow’s authority in Central Asia. In 2012, the base’s lease was extended to 2042, and at present its main combat elements are the 92nd and 149th Guards Motor Rifle Regiments, the 2nd Separate Rocket Artillery Battalion, a reconnaissance battalion in Dushanbe and the 191st Motor Rifle Regiment in Kurgan-Tyube. There is also a helicopter squadron and air group at Dushanbe. Considering that the 201st Base now consists of some 7,000 largely professional soldiers, equipped increasingly to the highest Russian standards, while the total Tajik armed forces number a reported 9,500, Moscow has a considerable role in regional security. Again, military deployments abroad are converted into influence, in this case in support of a friendly regime – or at least one that knows it pays to keep on Russia’s good side.

Balkan Dash

Yugoslavia had been a long-term thorn in Moscow’s side during the Cold War: a notionally socialist state, yet one which had refused to bow to Soviet hegemony. This multi-ethnic state essentially disintegrated at the same time as the USSR, though, especially as opportunist Communist Party official Slobodan Milosevic reinvented himself as a Serbian nationalist leader. Amidst protests, strikes and inter-ethnic clashes, nationalists rose across the country and civil war exploded in 1991–92.

On one level, it could be argued that this was none of Moscow’s business. Russia has deep historical and cultural connections to the region, especially to the Orthodox Christian Serbs, but nonetheless at first it paid little attention to the Balkans. It had, after all, enough to occupy it at home. However, by 1993, this was changing. Extreme nationalist politicians like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the Liberal Democratic Party (which, as has already been noted, is neither liberal nor democratic), were using the situation to paint the Yeltsin government as weak and willing to betray traditional allies to curry favour with the West. Furthermore, the Kremlin was beginning to feel taken for granted by that same West, and this gave it an opportunity to try to show that it was not a spent force.

Russia would play a role within UNPROFOR, the UN Protection Force which sought in 1992–95 to make a tenuous peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, amidst ethnic cleansing and vicious conflicts that pitted neighbour against neighbour. An initial force of 900 soldiers would in due course be scaled up to an airborne brigade of 1,500 paratroopers in the Implementation Force (IFOR) and Stabilization Force (SFOR) that replaced it in 1996. The largest non-NATO contingent in these forces, Russia’s peacekeepers played a useful role not just on the ground but also in making the case that, for all its troubles, Russia ought still to be considered a serious global player. When IFOR and SFOR were formed, a Russian general was invited to become a Special Deputy to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) in the hope that this would resolve command and control issues – and also symbolize a closer NATO–Russia relationship.

The 1990s, though, saw Russia increasingly dissatisfied with how it was being treated and becoming worried that the West was coming to see itself as the global hegemon, banker and policeman, all in one. The expansion of NATO, seen as still an essentially anti-Russian alliance, was a particular bone of contention. When US president Bill Clinton visited Moscow in May 1995, Yeltsin said this was ‘nothing but a humiliation’ for Russia, and he flatly rejected the idea: ‘for me to agree to the borders of NATO expanding towards those of Russia – that would constitute a betrayal on my part of the Russian people.’5 Yet NATO still expanded, taking in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in 1999, and nine more countries were offered Membership Action Plans detailing their path to joining the alliance. However, Russian suspicions truly came to the fore during the 1998–99 Kosovo War. This ethnically Albanian region of what was left of Yugoslavia – then just Serbia and Montenegro – was increasingly restive, and terrorist attacks by the Kosovo Liberation Army prompted a heavy-handed Serbian response that was crossing the line between legitimate counter-insurgency, and outright ethnic cleansing.

When peace talks failed, NATO launched a massive aerial bombing campaign in March and June 1999, with the stated aim of getting ‘Serbs out, peacekeepers in, refugees back’. Almost a thousand aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions, and 218 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched. First they targeted Yugoslav air defence and high-value military targets, then military units and command hubs. Inevitably, there were civilian casualties and targeting errors – not least, the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade – but eventually Milosevic had to accept NATO’s terms, which included the withdrawal of his forces from Kosovo and the deployment of a multi-national peacekeeping force.

The Russians had been instrumental in persuading Milosevic to stand down, and insisted on being involved in this force. They presumed that they, like other major participants, would be assigned their own peacekeeping sector. NATO, fearing this would essentially create a Serb-controlled region, refused, and so Moscow decided it would make its own facts on the ground. On the first day of the peace, 11 June 1999, 250 Russian paratroopers under Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin rushed from their SFOR base in Bosnia to seize Pristina International Airport in Kosovo’s capital first. By the time substantial numbers of troops from KFOR, the NATO-led Kosovo Force, had reached Pristina, the Russians were emplaced.

There followed a tense standoff, only partly eased when KFOR’s commander, Britain’s Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, met Zavarzin in the ruins of the airport terminal, and the two men shared a flask of whisky. Jackson, who had read Russian Studies at Birmingham University, did not accept SACEUR Gen. Wesley Clark’s belief that this was just a bridgehead and the start of a Russian occupation. Clark wanted Jackson to defy the Russians and occupy and block the airport runways, and Jackson reportedly eventually retorted, ‘I’m not going to start the Third World War for you.’6

Jackson was right, in that while there were other Russian forces on alert, there was no wider plan for invasion. The three remaining VDV battalions would only have been deployed had NATO tried to dislodge the Russians by force. Instead, Clark was overruled by Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a deal was struck allowing both sides to save face, with Russian peacekeepers deploying throughout Kosovo, but without their own sector and outside NATO’s command structure. This was, after all, more about Moscow’s use of the military to make a wider political point, both at home and abroad. The ‘Pristina Dash’ heartened a Russian public and military which had been starved of good news. It also set the tone for future Russian interventions, relying on élan, surprise and a willingness to bluff. These were exactly the kind of characteristics that appealed to the man who, in 1999, had just been appointed Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
