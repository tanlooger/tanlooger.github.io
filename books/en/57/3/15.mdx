title: 15 Donbas, 2014–
---



One of the striking aspects of the undeclared and often ill-defined conflict that erupted in south-eastern Ukraine shortly after the Crimean annexation is the degree to which it was at first fought mainly by irregulars, nationalists, patriots and enthusiasts.1 The man who did the most to, in his own words, ‘pull the trigger’ on this war, Igor Girkin – more commonly known by his nom de guerre Strelkov, or ‘Shooter’ – while a former FSB officer, was acting not just without orders when he led a rag-tag collection of gunmen across the Ukrainian border in April 2014, but seemingly against them. Likewise, in the desperate and confused first weeks and months of the conflict in the Donbas (Donetsk Basin) region, much of the most serious fighting to keep it under Kyiv’s control was done not by government soldiers but by volunteers banding together in militias, sometimes under the patronage of local oligarchs. Indeed, some were not even Ukrainian; for example, former Chechen rebel Isa Minayev travelled to Ukraine from exile in Denmark to form the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion, largely of former ex-rebels.

Over time, the situation would become more formalized, this messy conflict, half a genuine civil war, half a Russian proxy conflict, being fought between Ukrainian forces on the one hand, and Moscow-supported and -armed rebels often under Russian army commanders and supported by Russian regulars on the other. Nonetheless, in contrast to the Crimean operation, the war in the Donbas was not some long-planned intervention.

In June 2014, when it was already clear that Moscow’s follow-on operation in south-eastern Ukraine was not going to plan, a former Russian General Staff officer told me, ‘Had the Ukrainians fought for Crimea, we would not now be fighting in the Donbas.’ The ease of its seizure, after all, and the disarray in Kyiv encouraged Putin and his advisers to make a fateful over-reach. Crimea had been a unique case: a peninsula where Russia already had a military position, whose population in the main felt unhappy with how Kyiv had treated them for years, and which the majority of Russians rightly felt was theirs. Nonetheless, although not part of the original plan, after Crimea, some within Russia and even within the Kremlin began contemplating a limited and deniable military operation in the more ethnically Russian east of Ukraine. The aim this time was not territorial conquest but political pressure: to convince Kyiv that Moscow could and would punish it for any moves towards closer integration with the West. At the time, the assumption was that this would intimidate Ukraine and force it to accept that it was part of Russia’s sphere of influence. It was a fateful miscalculation.

There were genuine protests and concerns in the east, which had been both ousted president Yanukovych’s power base and also disproportionately populated by Russian-speakers who were genuinely concerned about the implications of the new government and wanted not so much independence as greater autonomy. This was at once magnified by Moscow’s media, which began characterizing the new government as a ‘fascist junta’. Meanwhile, there were attempts to start risings in the cities in the east – some purely local efforts, some seemingly backed by figures within Russia acting on their own authority. Most failed, because of either a lack of real support or the timely and effective work of the security forces. In the cities of Donetsk and Lugansk, though, protesters stormed local government buildings and called for referenda on self-determination and even joining Russia, presumably inspired by Crimea’s example. Acting Ukrainian president Olexander Turchinov angrily threatened ‘counter-terrorism measures’. All that was needed was a spark.

Strelkov’s Spark

That spark was provided by 52 volunteers and mercenaries from Crimea commanded by Igor Girkin, better known as Strelkov. An ardent Russian nationalist with a background in the FSB (although some have claimed he was actually in the GRU), he was a former Russian artillery officer and keen military re-enactor, with two decades of involvements in a variety of often dirty civil wars, supporting pro-Moscow separatists in Moldova in 1992 and Serbs in the 1992–95 Bosnian War, as well as fighting against rebels in Chechnya 1999–2005. In many of these conflicts, he was subsequently accused of human rights abuses. Nonetheless, his passion for the cause of Russia and Russians abroad was undeniable.

On 12 April 2014, Strelkov led his ragtag force into Ukraine, dodging both Russian and Ukrainian border guards. He opted to lead them to the town of Slovyansk, where anti-Kyiv protesters had already essentially taken control. There he took control of the local militia and together they were able to drive off an initial response by operators from the SBU, Ukraine’s Security Service. Kyiv began mustering more formidable forces, but meanwhile the rebellion was spreading. In both Lugansk and Donetsk, armouries were captured and emptied and militias began to be formed. This was not coordinated, nor was it necessarily pro-Moscow, and the Kremlin was uncertain whether it actually wanted to be involved. After all, it had Crimea, the prize it had really desired.

Nonetheless, a sense grew in Moscow that this rising could not be allowed to fail – not least, to avoid nationalist protest at home – and also offered an opportunity. Some Kremlin figures believed that the anti-Kyiv protest in eastern Ukraine would naturally spread, but others looked instead at the arithmetic of power. As of March, the government could muster only perhaps 6,000 combat-ready troops from its entire army, and had to guard its borders and the Crimean isthmus. Surely, with just a little help, the rebellion could survive as long as needed to bring Kyiv to, as they saw it, its senses? At the time, one Russian professor with links to the Foreign Ministry told me, ‘The Ukrainian junta has over-reached; but they must know they need Russian trade and friendship. Once they have come to their senses, we will be able to talk.’

Many in Moscow thought this way: they did not have any interest in annexing the Donbas. Rather, this was the shock treatment needed to get the new revolutionary government in Kyiv to ‘come to its senses’. Everyone inside the system I talked to in Moscow at the time assured me it was just a matter of six months: by summer, Kyiv would have realized it could not break away from Moscow and all would be calm again. Of course, it turned out that they were wrong.

A War of Irregulars

They misunderstood the nature of this crisis, assuming that the wider eastern Ukrainian, Russian-speaking population’s genuine concerns about the new government would make them actively support the rebellion. For most, that was a step too far. They also misunderstood the degree to which ordinary Ukrainians, including many from that very same Russian-speaking community, would be willing to take up arms to defend their nation’s sovereignty.

Government forces were indeed few and often badly equipped and unmotivated. Even relatively elite units were often unwilling to engage with rebels; in one distinctly embarrassing case, paratroopers from the 25th Airborne Brigade let rebels seize five BMD airborne infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and a Nona self-propelled mortar without a fight, while commanders of another of their columns meekly surrendered their rifles when faced with ‘a crowd of men drinking beer and women yelling taunts and insults’.2 In another instance, observed by a foreign journalist, Interior Ministry troops openly sold rebels guns and ammunition in return for home-brew and slabs of salo, cured pork fat.

However, much of the heavy lifting in the first months of the war was borne by pro-government militias. Some were akin to local self-defence volunteers, like the loyalists of the Donbas Battalion. Others were virtually the private armies of powerful Ukrainian oligarchs who bankrolled them, like Dnipro-1, a battalion founded by Ihor Kolomoisky, the billionaire whom Kyiv had appointed Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Region. Some of the more controversial came from political movements, like the neo-Nazis who formed the Azov Regiment. They turned out to be some of the more effective fighters of the initial stages of the war, but have also been dogged by allegations of war crimes and white supremacism (that led to the US Congress formally stipulating that military aid being sent to Ukraine could not go to Azov).

Arrayed against them was an equally varied mix of separatist militias, some made up of locals, others of mercenaries and volunteers from Russia, often with encouragement, weapons and guidance from Moscow. Many were also defectors from the government side: by summer of 2015, according to Ukraine’s Chief Military Prosecutor, 5,000 police and 3,000 soldiers had joined the rebels. There was no standardization in size, origins or structure of these units, which ranged from relatively effective ones such as Mikhail ‘Givi’ Tolstykh’s Somalia Battalion (reportedly so named because its fighters were ‘as brave as Somalis’) and Arsen ‘Motorola’ Pavlov’s Sparta Battalion to grandiosely named but typically smaller militias such as the Russian Orthodox Army (drawn largely from Ukrainian Cossacks) and the splendidly named Hooligan Battalion. Rostov-on-Don, capital of Russia’s Rostov region and an important port city and road and rail hub, became the logistical base for Moscow’s undeclared war. Not only does it house arsenals from which materiel was dispatched over the border to support the rebels, but the GRU maintained a significant presence here. Potential volunteers and mercenaries for the militias were screened, armed and mustered in the city.

This was a messy, dirty conflict, with both sides being credibly accused of human rights abuses, in part often because of a lack of a clear chain of command. Indeed, although rebel ‘People’s Republics’ would be formed, with Strelkov assembling a coalition of militias as the so-called South-East Army, these were shaky structures from the first. Their political leaders were often amateurish opportunists, and Strelkov was never able to monopolize the militias, because many local strongmen and warlords wanted to retain their autonomy. Indeed, some of these forces were little more than bandit gangs, more interested in plunder and extortion than any cause.



In May, the leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR: Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika) and Lugansk People’s Republic (LNR: Luganskaya Narodnaya Respublika) announced their independence from Ukraine and that they were forming a confederation known as Novorossiya – ‘New Russia’ – with Strelkov as their defence minister. This never came to anything, though: Moscow was not going to underwrite and bankroll some new nation. The idea as far as the Kremlin was concerned was to force Kyiv to accept the Donbas back as part of a political deal that kept Ukraine divided and deferential to Russia’s interests. Indeed, Strelkov would be dismissed in August, returning to Russia, where he became a vocal critic of Putin and the government, regarding it as inconsistent and weak in its defence of Russian interests and nationals abroad.

He was a ruthless and relatively competent commander, but he was not only politically inconvenient; he had become toxic for his role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. On 17 July 2014, MH17 was on a scheduled run from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. While flying over eastern Ukraine, it was hit by a missile and crashed, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board. Although Moscow has advanced numerous alternative explanations, a detailed inquiry by a Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team concluded that it was shot down by a Buk M1 SA-11 SAM fired from separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. The system in question appears to have been one of several originally fielded by Russia’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade, which was supplied to the rebels, likely with crews. Judging by a subsequently deleted social media post from Strelkov (‘In the region of Torez, an AN-26 plane has been shot down, somewhere near the “Progress” mine. We warned them – not to fly “in our sky.” Here is video-proof of yet another “bird fall.”’), the rebels thought the target was a Ukrainian An-26 transport plane. The presence of heavy weapons systems such as the Buk demonstrates how quickly Moscow moved to support the rebels, and the provision of SAMs in particular helps explain why Ukraine has not been able to rely on its air assets much. However, there is no evidence that Russian military commanders were involved in the launch decision, also underlining the relative autonomy of their proxy warlords.

The ‘Northern Wind’

On 1 May, Kyiv reintroduced conscription, as it prepared first to isolate and then to reconquer the rebel-held regions. Small-scale offensives were launched on towns under DNR control including Slovyansk, Mariupol and Kramatorsk. After repeated attacks, and heavy artillery barrages, Strelkov and his forces retreated from Slovyansk on 5 July, falling back to Kramatorsk. This seemed to trigger a general collapse in rebel unity and morale, and Kramatorsk and Artemivsk fell shortly thereafter, followed by Mariupol. Meanwhile, rebels and government forces were fighting over Donetsk International Airport, a short drive from the DNR’s headquarters.

Up to this point, Moscow had been trying to limit its involvement. It was willing to let volunteers from Russia go to join the rebels, and was trickling in some heavier weapons such as shoulder-fired SAMs and then heavier air defence systems to counter the government’s airpower advantage (though Kyiv was using it less after the loss of several helicopters and aircraft) and a limited number of tanks and howitzers. There was even one militia unit, the Vostok Battalion, which appears to have been raised by the GU from Chechen and Abkhazian veterans of the war in Chechnya and sent to Donetsk precisely as both to stiffen the rebel forces and, if necessary, act as Moscow’s instrument there. Other Russian volunteers joining command positions with the LNR and DNR forces were probably ‘volunteers’, military officers sent to try to reverse the rebel retreat.

It didn’t work. By August, the rebel-held areas were shrinking steadily. Above all, government forces seemed close to regaining control over the border with Russia, which would allow them to throttle off the supply of fighters, weapons and ammunition, as well as driving a wedge between the DNR and the LNR. This would mark the end of the rebels, and already there were hints that some of their leaders were seeking either to flee to Russia or make their own deals with Kyiv. Moscow’s choice was to escalate or withdraw. It chose to escalate, abandoning any hope that deniable proxies with minimal assistance could hold their own against an increasingly confident alliance of government troops and militias. The Kremlin might not have started this rebellion, but having decided to try to co-opt it, it wasn’t willing to let it be defeated.

On 7 August, government mechanized and airborne forces, supported by several militia battalions, launched an attempt to take back Ilovaisk, a railway junction east of Donetsk, which had been in rebel hands since April. At first, they were able to push back the DNR forces, and by 18 August they had fought their way to the centre of the city. It now seemed just a matter of mopping up. However, on 24 August a sudden counter-attack caught them by surprise, and saw the government forces encircled within the city when some 4,000 Russian regular troops, including both paratroopers and T-72B3 tanks of the 6th Tank Brigade, crossed the border in support of the rebels.

The 92nd Mechanized Brigade launched an attack to break through to the other government forces in Ilovaisk, but was hit by heavy and accurate artillery fire and then assaulted by Russian paratroopers, forcing it to retreat. Over a few days, the tactical situation had completely changed, and the encircled troops began trying to negotiate their way out. In what was an implicit acknowledgement of Russia’s role, on 29 August Putin himself announced that a ‘humanitarian corridor’ ought to be opened to allow them to leave, and DNR prime minister Alexander Zakharchenko hurriedly agreed, even though the government forces would be expected to leave their armoured vehicles and heavy weapons behind.

When some 1,600 remaining government troops did begin to withdraw, disputes emerged over the route of the retreat and their determination to retain their armoured vehicles. Whether or not this was a deliberate ploy to justify breaking the ceasefire, it led to small-scale clashes that triggered Russian artillery bombardments. The discipline of the Ukrainians broke, and several hundred were taken prisoner. By 1 September, Ilovaisk was back in rebel hands, more than 350 government troops and militia were dead, and a new stage of the war had begun as the so-called ‘Northern Wind’ – direct intervention by Moscow – was blowing.

The Fixing of the Conflict

In August 2014, the Russians deployed an estimated 3,500–6,500 troops into Ukraine, growing to a peak of some 10,000 by the end of the year. There had already been small detachments from the 2nd and 10th Spetsnaz Brigades, the 106th Guards Airborne Division and the 45th Guards Airborne Spetsnaz Regiment. Then, elements of the 9th and 18th Motor Rifle Brigades were deployed to prepare the ground. The first wave of regular combat forces saw the introduction of Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) drawn from fully ten manoeuvre units: the 17th, 18th, 21st and 33rd Motor Rifle Brigades, the 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade, the 2nd Spetsnaz Brigade, the 104th and 247th Air-Assault Regiments and the 137th and 331st Airborne Regiments. At this point, the age of so-called ‘hybrid war’, one in which disinformation, deniable political operations and other non-kinetic means are at least as important as the actual fighting on the battlefield, was virtually over. Instead this was looking much more like a conventional, even if undeclared, war in which both sides fielded mixes of regular forces and militias in sporadic, but brutal conflict.

The government forces had been able to win victories against the poorly disciplined and uncoordinated rebel militias, but the Ukrainians had no illusions about their ability to resist Russian forces. With Moscow’s more overt entry into the war, Kyiv was forced to agree to the Minsk Protocol peace deal in September, although the ceasefire this was meant to bring proved pretty illusory. Sporadic clashes continued, followed by the much more serious Second Battle of Donetsk Airport as DNR troops fought to dislodge government troops from their last foothold in the city. It took almost four months of fighting – during which time the defenders gained the popular nickname ‘cyborgs’ for their seemingly inhuman tenacity – but by the end of January 2015, it was in rebel hands.

With direct Russian assistance, the rebels were able to make advances. A particular example was the strategically vital city of Debaltseve. Located between the territories held by the DNR and LNR, it was also a key road and rail hub on the way to Artemivsk and Slovyansk. The rebels had seized it in April 2014, only for it to be recaptured by Kyiv’s troops in July. As a result, it was at the heart of a pocket of government-held territory wedged between the two rebel regions. In January 2015, in tough winter conditions and under a heavy artillery barrage, the rebels launched an offensive to capture the city. Government forces resisted, and in the ensuing artillery duel, soldiers and civilians alike were killed in significant numbers. As rebel forces encircled Debaltseve, ceasefires brokered by outside forces came to nothing. Attempts by Kyiv to relieve the 6,000 government troops in this ‘kettle’ were largely aborted by the volume of artillery fire being delivered, and it soon became clear that much of this was thanks to a Russian force drawn from the 8th and 18th Guards Motor Rifle Brigades and the 232nd Rocket Artillery Brigade, while the 25th Spetsnaz Regiment provided both assault troops and artillery spotters. A BTG based on the 136th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade was also leading the efforts to close the road corridor into the city, suffering sufficient losses that it had to be replaced with another from the 27th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade and the 217th Guards Airborne Regiment (from the 98th Guards Airborne Division). Ukrainian forces were eventually forced to withdraw under heavy fire on 18 February, leaving behind a shattered city but also a testimony to the scale of Russian involvement and the degree to which they could tip the balance.

Meanwhile, the Minsk Protocol having patently failed, negotiators were working on a new iteration, imaginatively named Minsk II. This was agreed on 12 February 2015, and proved no more successful. It envisaged an immediate ceasefire, elections in the rebel-held areas, their reintegration into Ukraine with a special status granting them considerable autonomy, and their return to government control. Any ceasefires were at best patchy and temporary, the elections held by the rebel authorities were deemed illegitimate by Kyiv, the law on special status passed by the Ukrainian parliament was damned as inadequate by the rebels, and the DNR and LNR remained resolutely in rebellion.

Instead, since 2015 the dynamic was largely one of consolidation: the conflict had not been fixed in the sense of being resolved, so much as fixed as in frozen in time. The government made considerable progress in rebuilding its military, and as of 2022 had over a quarter of a million men and women under arms. The pro-government militias were incorporated into a new National Guard and although some, especially those associated with ultranationalist movements, were still often wilful, in the main the patriotism evident in the volunteer units of 2014 was successfully harnessed.

Stalemate

On the other hand, a new pattern had been established. To erstwhile Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko’s government, this was an ‘Anti-Terrorist Operation’ (ATO). To the Kremlin, this was not a war at all; only in December 2015 did Putin finally admit that there were Russians in the Donbas ‘resolving various issues’ but even then, he denied they were combat forces.3 After all, when it could, Moscow continued to rely on its proxy militias, albeit increasingly under Russian officers. However, despite efforts to build them into a serious conventional army, they were often undisciplined or simply outgunned. Whenever government forces looked as if they were likely to make serious gains, though, the Russians surged in their battalion tactical groups to turn the tide.

In the first years of the conflict, the front lines ebbed and flowed and towns such as Debaltseve would exchange hands several times. As government forces became more competent and confident, the rebels’ ability to make gains diminished. Indeed, 2016 was the first year in which Kyiv lost no ground. In January 2017, the rebels launched an offensive against the government-held town of Avdiivka that was reminiscent of the full-on warfare of 2014, with mass artillery bombardments and close ground engagements. The government forces held the line, though, and in 2018, Kyiv adopted new language, calling the rebel areas ‘temporarily occupied territories’ and replacing the term ATO with ‘Joint Forces Operation’.

What may sound like an essentially meaningless bit of wordplay did have significance, as it also coincided with a more assertive line from the government forces. By 2017, they were episodically nudging their positions forward, deeper into the so-called ‘grey zone’, the no-man’s land along the line of contact. They realized that this could not be converted into a serious attempt to roll back the rebel lines, though, without triggering a Russian response. Conversely, while Moscow continued to support the rebels, maintained large contingents ready to intervene, and deployed a range of other assets, including army and FSB sniper teams, it knew that breaking the stalemate would require a major and overt military escalation, with all the political costs that would entail. So the pattern was one of on-off ceasefires, trench warfare, sporadic local fighting, mutual sniping and shelling, and equally mutual recrimination, until 2022 when Putin decided that it was time to break the stalemate.
