title: 18 Syria, 2015– (2)：Lessons of the Syrian Campaign
---



Even more than Chechnya or the Donbas, the Syrian War was a learning opportunity for the Russians.1 Many soldiers served a three to four-month tour there, including most senior Ground Forces commanders and more than half of brigade- or regiment-level commanders, while the majority of the VKS’s pilots have, as of the start of 2022, at least some genuine combat experience in its skies. The war has allowed the Russians to test and refine tactics and, especially, their command and control systems, as well as posing new challenges for their logistical chains. They have showcased new weapons like the Kalibr cruise missile and been able to experiment with how they use others, from precision-guided munitions to drones. Much of this has fed into the wider evolution of the modern Russian military, discussed in later chapters. However, certain engagements illustrate certain very specific lessons of the campaign.

## Airpower is not (usually) enough

In May 2015, Islamic State had captured the historic and strategic city of Palmyra in what had been its largest offensive in Syria to date, imposing a bloody reign of terror that saw scores of supposed government sympathizers executed in the main square. In July, Syrian forces tried to recapture it, but were driven back. Col. Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, the first commander of the GVS, wanted to test the forces at his disposal before turning to the more significant target of Aleppo; he was also shortly due to return to Russia and it may be that he wanted a headline victory to his credit. Either way, the decision was made to take back Palmyra.

The initial plan had been for the offensive to be launched by Syrian forces, supported by Russian airpower. Palmyra was a hard target, though, with more than 2,000 Islamic State defenders, behind a ring of trenches and strongpoints. Although the Central Command in Damascus was apparently bullish, Dvornikov’s own commanders were much less confident that most Syrian forces, with the exception of some elite forces such as the Republican Guard’s Marine Regiment and Air Force Intelligence’s Tiger Forces, had the stomach for close-quarters urban battle. They were also unconvinced that Syrian scouts were yet able to provide the kind of accurate and timely targeting information that would really make their air attacks count.

To this end, the Russians quietly committed the deniable ‘pseudo-mercenary’ force known as the Wagner Group to provide a reserve of shock troops for the assault, while teams of special forces operators from KSSO would act as forward air and artillery observers. Although their role was downplayed at the time, not least to save Damascus’s blushes, several officers involved in the Syrian operations have since confirmed that they were crucial in tipping the balance; as one put it, ‘It often wasn’t about firepower but determination – they held the line when a small retreat could have triggered a rout.’

The operation began on 9 March 2016 with rocket and artillery barrages and extensive airstrikes: 15–20 sorties on each of the first few days. After three days to soften up the defenders, the Syrians began to attack strongpoints on three sides of the city, as well as heights which commanded it. They did not move quickly, but they did manage to take their objectives, helped by the confusion created when a Russian rocket hit the headquarters of Khalil Mohameed, Islamic State’s ‘emir’ of the city, killing him and several of his staff. So far, though, the Syrians had been able to rely on concentrating strength of numbers on isolated targets; as they approached Palmyra itself, there would be no more easy victories. On 17 March, though, a sudden sandstorm gave Islamic State an opportunity to counter-attack, and although it was beaten back, this seems to have shaken the morale of the government troops. Syrian Marines and veteran Hezbollah militia were rushed to the front line, but at this point Dvornikov decided not only to deploy Wagner but to order the KSSO teams closer to the city to try to target any further attacks. His fear, according to someone who was on his staff at the time, was that another sally might trigger a Syrian rout. He also stepped up the tempo of air attacks, with up to 25 sorties a day.

The methodical pace continued – Dvornikov simply did not feel he could rely on the Syrians for anything more daring. The airstrikes were having a significant impact on Islamic State, especially thanks to the KSSO spotters who were having to put themselves in harm’s way. One, for example, was 25-year-old KSSO operator Senior Lt. Alexander Prokhorenko. On 17 March, he was separated from the rest of his team when he encountered some Islamic State fighters retreating from their failed counter-attack. Pinned down and surrounded, there seemed no hope for him, so as his last fire order, he called down an airstrike on his own position, ensuring that they too would share his fate. He was posthumously awarded the Hero of Russia.

Nonetheless, at this stage all Russia’s artillery and bombers could do was disrupt – the battle would be won or lost on the ground. Meanwhile, more reinforcements for the government side arrived: militias of the National Defence Force and Iranian-supported Shi’ites. This campaign had to end in victory, if it was to help the Syrian forces begin to regain their confidence, and Dvornikov and the Central Command were willing to throw in whatever it took.

By 24 March, the attackers were just outside the city and that evening they started pushing their way in. The offensive degenerated into a series of attacks on heavily defended strategic objectives, such as Palmyra Prison and the Semiramis Hotel, and here Wagner’s veterans were often crucial in forcing the attack. Fighting was fierce, and as neither Damascus nor Moscow wanted to be accused of risking the historic ruins to the west of the city, artillery and air support was largely limited to other neighbourhoods. By the 27th, the city was back in government hands, bar some final mopping up. It was badly damaged, and Islamic State left hundreds of landmines that Russian and Syrian engineers would take over a month to clear.

Symbolically, on 5 May, the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and virtuoso cellist (and old friend of Putin’s) Sergei Roldugin performed a concert, at the Roman amphitheatre of Palmyra, dedicated to Prokhorenko’s memory. Although Islamic State would briefly recapture the city again in December 2016, only to lose it the next year. The government victory in March at Palmyra had demonstrated to the Russians that they could not rely entirely on arm’s length ‘non-contact’ firepower so long as their allies could not be trusted to exploit this advantage on the ground. On the other hand, though, it confirmed their belief that relatively small numbers of the right men at the right place can have a disproportionate impact. More than 7,000 soldiers had been deployed to the attack, of whom Wagner seem to have provided possibly as few as 300, but their presence at the front in the assault helped maintain the necessary momentum to take the city.

Likewise, fewer than a hundred Spetsnaz were present there, some as snipers, most as forward air and artillery controllers. Nonetheless, they allowed the Russian airstrikes to be much more precise and effective than they would otherwise have been, and for them to be launched safely closer to the precious ruins of Palmyra. In short, although there was already a general understanding in both Moscow and Hmeymim that airpower alone cannot win such a war, as one Russian officer put it in 2017, ‘This battle helped quickly to demonstrate to some of the more extreme proponents of “non-contact warfare” the limitations of the approach.’ Ironically, in his opinion, both the Ground Forces and the Aerospace Forces quickly generated their own spin: the groundhogs used it to underline their continued centrality, while the pilots could excuse any mistakes they made by blaming insufficient targeting assistance from them.

## Mercenaries have their place, but need to know it

On 7 February 2018, a force of some 500 Syrian troops from the so-called ‘ISIS Hunters’ unit of the 5th Corps, Iranian-trained militias and Wagner Group mercenaries approached an SDF post near the town of Khasham, on the Euphrates route towards Deir ez-Zor, which the SDF had captured from Islamic State the year before. They crossed the river and began shelling the post. However, the Americans had a significant presence here and close ties with the local SDF. Indeed, there were US Special Forces operators at that post. Of course, US reconnaissance had seen this force assemble and begin moving days before, and as it neared Khasham, they used their deconfliction line to Hmeymim, as well as turning to their GVS liaison officer in Deir ez-Zor itself, to ask what was going on. Were these Russian forces? Nothing to do with us, was the reply. So the Americans felt free to make something of a display of the firepower at their disposal. In response to its attack, the force was targeted by everything from B-52 bombers and F-15E Strike Eagle jets to rocket artillery and missiles fired from AH-64 gunships. The attack was shattered in four hours of hell, suffering more than 200 casualties, including perhaps a couple of dozen Wagner mercenaries. One SDF soldier was injured in the initial attack, and no Americans were hurt.

Was this a Russian blunder? Was the command in Hmeymim simply too embarrassed to admit Wagner’s presence? Actually, what seems to have happened is that while in 2015 and 2016, the GVS needed the mercenaries, in 2017 it decided their job was done. The Syrian military was in better shape, and the over-paid and all-too-cocky mercenaries – who might be being paid twice or even three times as much as the regular soldiers and posted to the GVS, and were not shy about saying so – were no longer needed.

At peak, Wagner had maintained a force of some 2,500 mercenaries in Syria, in four battalion-strength, three-company line units, a tank company with T-72s, an artillery battalion, a reconnaissance company, and support elements. This was expensive to maintain, and by 2017, payments from the Defence Ministry had stopped or at least begun to taper off (accounts vary). But the Kremlin wanted Wagner to be maintained, in case it was needed somewhere else, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the businessman charged with this duty, thus looked to make cuts and find new opportunities. By all accounts, from early 2017, the quality of Wagner’s new hires and replacement kit began to decline, as they could no longer afford to pay so well. More importantly, in January 2018, a deal was struck between Syria’s Energy Ministry and EvroPolis, another of Prigozhin’s companies, that meant that the latter would get a quarter of all the oil and gas revenues from areas Wagner retook for the government. And Deir ez-Zor has both oil and gas. This was war as business, as Prigozhin tried to balance the books.2

This was nothing to do with the GVS, which seemed only too happy to let the Americans teach the overweening mercenaries a lesson. After Deir ez-Zor, although Wagner would later crop up in a range of other conflicts, from Libya to Venezuela, its role in Syria shrank dramatically. The Russian military had learned that private military companies could be valuable instruments for both deniable operations and quick boosts to capacity, and would in fact go on to create their own. However, they also came to realize how important it was to avoid the danger of, shall we say, the tail Wagnering the dog: the mercenaries need to know who’s boss.

## Brutality can work, but hearts and minds matter, too

Since 2013, Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, had been effectively divided, with loyalists holding the west of the city, the FSA the east. Having defused any immediate threat from Islamic State, in July 2016 the stalemate was broken when government forces managed to encircle the rebel-held parts of the city, cutting their supply lines. After weathering several serious but unsuccessful counter-attacks, in November they launched their own major offensive on the rebel positions, forcing them to evacuate the city the next month.

Taking Eastern Aleppo was a brutal exercise in pragmatic modern siegecraft. Supply routes were cut, and humanitarian assistance to the 300,000-strong civilian population in the rebel-held neighbourhoods blocked. It was no easy task, to be sure, but by September, government forces had closed their grip. Despite another rebel counter-offensive, government forces were able slowly to push them back, and by the end of October they were in control of about half of Eastern Aleppo.

They were able to do this in part because of a massive and sustained bombing campaign that mixed targeted and indiscriminate raids. Russian VKS forces were more precise, but the strong suspicion is that they deliberately targeted not just military objectives but also aid stations and hospitals, to make life in besieged Aleppo unendurable. The Syrians were even more brutal. As well as a couple of reported uses of chlorine gas – banned under international law – they made widespread use of ‘barrel bombs’, crude improvised munitions that were little more than oil drums or the like, stuffed with explosive and metal fragments. Rolled out of helicopters, they were the dumbest of bombs, but also the most vicious, with the largest packed with almost a tonne of TNT and shrapnel. These were terror weapons; with no real attempt to aim them at military targets, they hit homes and shops, mosques and hospitals, schools and shelters. At peak, Aleppo was being hit by as many as 1,500 a month. Indeed, on 19 September 2016, Syrian helicopters hit a UN/Red Crescent aid convoy heading to Aleppo as well as a clinic in a rebel-held town near Aleppo with a combination of barrel bombs and rockets. More often, though, they were simply dumped out of helicopters in the vicinity of strategic objectives, on the principle that while most would not hit their target, they would still hit something, spreading terror and carnage behind the rebel lines. As a survivor recounted, Aleppo became a ‘circle of hell’, whose ‘streets are filled with blood’.3

By mid-December, most of the city was either in government hands or essentially no one’s, with the exception of Sheikh Maqsood neighbourhood, a predominantly Kurdish district controlled by its own People’s Protection Units (YPG). While technically connected to the wider rebel FSA, in practice the Kurds had stuck to defending their own territory and at times had fought both the government and rebels. In any case, at this point, the aim of the Russian and Syrian forces was simply to expel the rest of the rebels, and those civilians deemed to be potentially their sympathizers. After a couple of false starts, interspersed with periods of intense bombardment, ‘humanitarian corridors’ were established that allowed both fighters and civilians to leave, mainly to the rebellious Idlib Province, where a spectrum of guerrilla forces from the FSA to jihadists were still in contention. By 22 December 2016, the evacuation was over and Damascus was claiming to have complete control over the city – or at least what was left of it, strewn with the remains of the estimated 31,000 men, women and children who died in this four-year siege.

Aleppo had needed to be taken, and taken as quickly as possible, hence the ruthless tactics employed. However, the Russians also demonstrated an awareness that in a complex civil war like Syria’s, hearts and minds operations were also vital. They provided food parcels and demined civilian neighbourhoods (indeed, they quickly set up aid and medical stations in Aleppo), and brought order to areas which had been terrorized by bandits and jihadists. Engineers were deployed to conduct mine clearance missions (and from 2017, train Syrian sappers at new training centres established in Aleppo and Homs), as well as bridge rivers, clear roads and generally assist the mobility of the Syrian and allied forces. Furthermore, as the areas under government control expanded, the need for troops able to carry out rear-area security, humanitarian and deconfliction missions increased, especially as ceasefires began to be brokered on various fronts.

Since December 2016, this has become a primary mission of a sizeable contingent of the Russian Military Police (VP: Voyennaya Politsiya), a force that only became fully operational in 2014. With their distinctive red berets and brassards, they have become the official face of the GVS on the ground, and by 2020, a majority of the entire Military Police force had rotated through Syria. Furthermore, to increase their ability to find common ground with the locals, two special VP battalions were established in 2016, each of some 600 men recruited from the predominantly Muslim regions of Tatarstan and the North Caucasus. Indeed, according to unconfirmed reports, at least one battalion may actually have been Kadyrovtsy, the personal forces of Chechen autocrat Ramzan Kadyrov. Technically members of the National Guard, they were, it is claimed, transferred temporarily to the VP as part of Kadyrov’s ‘penance’ for having ordered or sanctioned the murder of prominent opposition figure – and relentless Kadyrov critic – Boris Nemtsov in Moscow in February 2015. Nonetheless, in their own way they do demonstrate a growing sophistication in Russian ‘hearts and minds’ operations.

## Frenemies can find themselves in battle

On 24 November 2015, two Russian Su-24M bombers were returning to Hmeymim after a sortie against rebels in northern Syria. As had become usual for Russian pilots on this run, they were cutting briefly into Turkish airspace, over a small piece of land that protruded into northern Syria. Two Turkish F-16s, which had deliberately been patrolling at low altitude, engaged them, 17 seconds after they crossed the border. An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile hit one bomber. Both of the aircrew ejected: the pilot was gunned down by Syrian Turkmen Brigade fighters while still descending on his parachute, the weapon officer was recovered in a search and rescue mission conducted under fire by Naval Infantry in two Mi-8AMTSh helicopters, but one marine was also killed in the operation.

Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had clearly been irked by the repeated incursions, however brief, especially as they were bombing Turkish-backed rebels, which is why this aerial ambush had been laid. A visibly furious Putin placed sanctions on Turkish goods, but Erdoğan in many ways out-Putined Putin and refused to back down. In due course, the Russians quietly relented. After all, despite their divergent interests in Syria, one of the most interesting relationships Russia has developed in recent years is with Turkey, a NATO member, but one that feels itself something of a neglected outsider, especially as the European Union is clearly reluctant to make it a member. (A common observation among Turks is that the Europeans are ‘happy for Turks to fight for them, happy for Turks to work for them, but not happy to let Turks join them’.)

Erdoğan has clear ambitions for a sphere of influence in the Balkans and the Middle East, which makes Turkey a regional rival for Russia, something that really came to the fore during the 2020 Nagorno–Karabakh War (see Chapter 28). Yet it also means that Ankara and Moscow share certain common interests and above all something of a common approach to geopolitics. As a former Russian official put it to me, ‘with the Turks, we don’t always agree, but we can always talk to them’.

Turkey had backed its ‘own’ rebel forces from at least 2013, suborning elements of the FSA such as the Syrian Turkmen Brigade, especially because it was wary of the ethnic Kurds of north-eastern Syria, who make up about 10% of the country’s total population. The concern was that if they were too successful in establishing their own militias and de facto nation, they would be allies and an inspiration to Turkey’s own unruly Kurds. As a result, Ankara was hostile not just to Damascus but also to the broadly based Syrian Democratic Forces, not least because the YPG were their single most effective SDF element. As well as Islamic State, the SDF was often in contention with Turkish-backed rebel groups, and so there was sometimes a complex ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ relationship between Moscow and Damascus and the SDF – and between Ankara and Islamic State.

Likewise, Ankara and Moscow managed to hammer out some kind of an understanding when the earlier de-escalation agreement over Idlib was broken in December 2019, when Syrian and Russian aircraft launched Operation Dawn of Idlib 2, a major bombing campaign on what was one of the last remaining rebel-held areas. The Turks were already unhappy about the upsurge in refugees crossing their border, but in February 2020, 33 Turkish soldiers were killed when a Syrian airstrike hit one of their border military posts. In response, Turkey’s Operation Spring Shield saw artillery bombardments and air and drone strikes launched against government forces. Reportedly, more than 300 government and Hezbollah troops were killed and several Syrian planes downed; Turkey lost more than 40 men and four drones. The danger was that Russia would be sucked in, but instead Presidents Erdoğan and Putin met in Moscow and concluded another and more serious de-escalation agreement that saw joint Russian and Turkish patrols monitoring a ceasefire.

In a way, one could expect two similarly ambitious and aggressive autocrats to be able to reach pragmatic deals. For Moscow, though, at least as striking was the way that, as one Russian Foreign Ministry staffer put it, ‘we learned Americans can be sensible, too’. By sensible, he meant pragmatic. Given that one of the drivers behind the intervention had been to challenge Washington’s efforts diplomatically to isolate it, it is hardly surprising that Russia and the US often found themselves at loggerheads. Nonetheless, however contradictory their goals – in 2016, President Obama warned that ‘the Assad regime cannot slaughter its way to legitimacy’4 – both countries were very careful to avoid direct engagement. After the brutal attack on Aleppo, for example, Washington abandoned talks about sharing intelligence against Islamic State, but they maintained official and unofficial lines of communication with the Russians to avoid accidental clashes. In 2017, as US-backed forces pushed against Islamic State east of the Euphrates, and Russian-backed forces moved in from the west, Washington and Moscow developed strong deconfliction arrangements. The one seeming failure of this process, the Deir ez-Zor incident discussed above, was not actually a failure at all: it is not that the Russians were not involved, it was that they washed their hands of Wagner.

## A nice little war is good for business

Syria has provided a showcase for the latest Russian weapons, no doubt in part with an eye to sales. Igor Kozhin, presidential assistant for military-technical cooperation, linked increased interest in Russian weapons to the conflict, noting that ‘countries of the Middle East want to buy our weapons, which have proven their effectiveness’ in Syria.5Admittedly, not every would-be exercise in showmanship worked. When the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov was sent to fly the flag and hammer the rebels, it did so, but also lost two of its planes: a MiG-29K that fell into the sea when it ran out of fuel, and a Su-33 which crashed when the arresting cable meant to slow it on landing failed. While repairs were made, the air wing had to transfer to Hmeymin.

However, it has been rather more useful for the professional soldiers. Although the practical impact of four-month in-country tours of duty should not be overstated just as, in the words of security scholar Pavel Baev, ‘a return flight to [Hmeymin] cannot make the Su-57 a combat-tested fighter’,6 it has had a value in blooding the officer corps, weeding out some who proved unable to cope in genuine action, and creating a greater sense of esprit de corps. The most able have been able to rise faster, new approaches to command and control have been tested, and above all, Russia’s capacity to wage a successful intervention war in a complex battlespace far from its own borders has been demonstrated. This all stands as testament to the successful reform of all the arms of service, as will be considered in the following chapters.
