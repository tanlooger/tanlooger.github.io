title: 30 Conclusions：The Eurasian Sparta?
---



In 2016, Park Patriot was opened in Kubinka, west of Moscow, next to the country’s main tank testing ground (where the finals of the Army Games discussed in Chapter 1 are held). Technically the Patriot Military Patriotic Park of Culture and Rest of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, this is 19 square kilometres of what has been called a ‘military Disneyland’. It is a frankly amazing example of Sergei Shoigu’s campaign to connect the armed forces to wider society. There are row upon row of tanks, aircraft and military vehicles of every kind, more than 600 of them, including ICBMs and a submarine. There is the Partisan Village, recreating the resistance of the Great Patriotic War. There is the Military Tactical Games Centre, where the whole family can don goggles and go play lasertag urban warfare – soon there will even be a replica of the Reichstag to storm, as if in Berlin in 1945. There are proper shooting ranges, tank and ship simulators, a canteen serving up military rations, huge displays devoted to the Syrian intervention and, since 2020, even the soaring Main Cathedral of the Armed Forces. Gold domes top khaki-coloured towers, and stained-glass mosaics in the vault recreate Red Army decorations and show angels looking down on Russian soldiers by a list of their feats, including ‘bringing peace to Georgia’ in 2008 and ‘fighting against international terrorism’ in Syria. The floor itself is metal, made of melted German weapons and tanks, trophies of the Great Patriotic War. I could go on.

Until Ukraine, it was easy to take Putin’s Russia at face value, as a militarized society supporting a confident, hard-hitting global warfighter of a nation. There is the organized but undoubtedly popular ritual of Victory Day, cars sport ‘To Berlin!’ stickers, and half-way down the tourist-trap Arbat Street in Moscow is a huge mural, covering the whole side of a building, of Marshal Zhukov, hero of the Great Patriotic War. Earnest gaggles of Yunarmiya – ‘Youth Army’ – members, teenagers in tan uniforms and bright red berets, are a fixture at patriotic events. The Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Navy (DOSAAF: Dobrovolnoye Obshchestvo Sodeistviya Armii, Aviatsii i Floty), a revived hold-over from Soviet times, provides a wide range of courses and training deemed of value in military service for young men and women, from shooting to orienteering, parachute jumping to radio-electronics. Tens of thousands of young Russians thus enter the military already with some basic training. Even if you don’t watch the Defence Ministry’s own Zvezda TV station, there’s a rich diet of war films, more modern tales of martial or espionage derring-do, news stories extolling new weapons or the latest exercises, and a distinctively Russian kind of evening geopolitical talk show that is closer to gladiatorial entertainment than serious analysis, shouty pundits competing to spin some more elaborately paranoid conspiracy theory about the West than the next.

Sometimes, though, volume is a product of inner insecurity, not confidence. Even before its lacklustre performance in Ukraine, one could seriously question whether Russia really was some new, 21st-century Sparta, and how far it was going to be able to assert a true and lasting claim to great power status on the back of its apparent military capabilities and its evident willingness to use them. If anything, the Kremlin let itself be seduced by all this theatre and not only over-rated its capacities when it came to Ukraine, but also failed to appreciate how far the old metrics of power – numbers of men, tanks and aircraft, how well they marched through Red Square – would mean less and less in a new age of precision munitions, space forces, ‘mosaic war’, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.

A Nation under arms?

The war against Ukraine certainly demonstrated that there was an imbalance between the Kremlin’s military ambitions and the peacetime forces it could readily muster. There is a line of argument that suggests this will only get worse and that Russia and its military will soon hit a serious demographic challenge – simply put, not enough young men. Even before the collapse of the USSR, Russia was going through a demographic crisis, with high death rates (especially due to poor healthcare and a serious alcohol problem), which only worsened in the 1990s, and although the situation has since improved, the impact will be lasting. A United Nations report, for example, found that while there would be a projected 14.25 million men aged 20–34 in Russia in 2020, that would have declined to 11.55 by 2025 and would continue to fall through to the 2030s, when it would again pick up. The implication is a 20% decrease in the number of eligible, conscript-age young men through the 2020s, even before COVID-19 hit. As if this were not enough of a headache, ethnic Russians have relatively fewer children, and a growing proportion of these young men come from the culturally Muslim south, the North Caucasus – the source also of the worst potential internal problems.

Given that the Kremlin is still committed both to maintaining armed forces of the current size – which requires conscription – and also to attracting and retaining kontraktniki, this raises all kinds of difficult policy dilemmas. Raise salaries further to make an army career more attractive? Possible, but expensive. Extend national service back to two years? That would make some military sense, but it would be politically very unpopular. There have been other initiatives, from recruiting more women (there are currently around 45,000 in the ranks, all volunteers), to moves to clean up the voyenkomaty, the draft boards, which used to be notoriously corrupt, allowing people to bribe their way out of service, but these only nibble at the corners of the problem.

This is, however, overblown. Draft-dodging has been falling (although the prospect of fighting in Ukraine may well send it back up), and although the military still struggles to get as many kontraktniki as it would like, in many ways it has done surprisingly well. (Besides, if Russia ever does annex the Donbas, there is another boost for the population.) Furthermore, the long-dilapidated reserve system which allows former conscripts and volunteers to be called back to arms – and ensures they have been getting regular training sessions to maintain at least some fighting form – has been the focus of considerable attention. By 2022, it was estimated that at least 100,000 reservists could be called up through the new National Army Combat Reserve (BARS: Boyevoy Armeysky Rezerv Strany) system, only set up the year before, which offers small stipends in return for participation. Even without a formal national mobilization, the BARS system has already been activated in spring 2022 to try to replenish the depleted battalion tactical groups in Ukraine, which will be a case study in its effectiveness, although tales of outright refusals to serve soon emerged.

The Military Myth?

The willingness of young Russian men (and women) to serve depends on the willingness of the authorities to prosecute draft-dodgers, which they do, and on the salaries and benefits available to kontraktniki, but also on the degree to which they regard service in the armed forces as a valuable and honourable calling. In late Soviet times, this was a growing challenge, with those who could escape conscription by corruption or contacts doing so. The tales of horror and hardship filtering back from Afghanistan only exacerbated an existing aversion, as did increasing candour about indiscipline, abuse and bullying in the ranks.

Military service under Putin retained its dark corners and unnecessary hardships. That distinctively Russian form of violent and abusive hazing, dedovshchina, remains widely prevalent; according to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, there were nearly 4,000 military court prosecutions in the period 2016–20.1 There are also periodic cases of alcoholic indiscipline, like the soldier who, while drunk, thought he would borrow a BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle to go and buy cigarettes. He managed to drive it into a ditch and so he returned to the training ground to liberate another BMP-2 in order to tow it out. However, he had neglected to power the first vehicle down properly, and so in the meantime, it caught fire. He ended up causing more than 1.8 million rubles in damage.2

There has been a campaign, especially under Shoigu, to burnish the reputation of the military and increase the appeal of military life. There are officially a quarter of a million in the Yunarmiya youth movement and more than 100,000 a year take part in some activity or another, from ceremonial guard duty at Great Patriotic War memorials to sports events. Even more striking has been the alliance between the Defence Ministry and the Russian Orthodox Church. As the Great Patriotic War increasingly becomes an almost religious event, central to the new Russian state’s identity, so too state, church and military have become intertwined. Some religious figures are uncomfortable with this, but Patriarch Kirill and the rest of the top hierarchy either genuinely support this alliance or accept it as politically unavoidable. Military chaplains were revived back in 2009 (not all Orthodox: there are also a few rabbis and imams), although the church drew the line at camouflage cassocks. Priests bless tanks and missiles, and while in 2020 Kirill instructed them not to consecrate nuclear weapons, Borei-class ballistic missile submarines do have a tiny chapel (and a small banya, or sauna, but that’s another matter).

All this had an impact. Sergei Shoigu was consistently second only to Putin in public recognition and trust, and public attitudes towards the military as a whole definitely improved: as an institution, they polled second only to the presidency, above even the church.3 However, Shoigu was popular and respected even before he became Defence Minister, and attitudes towards the military may have improved, but only from a frankly appalling low. Only 18.4% of Moscow students polled in 2020 believed that military service was a ‘promising’ field, a figure well below new technology (49.7%) and law (29%), but nonetheless in the middle of the range, above healthcare (12.8%), for example, and well above the arts (8.9%).4 In any case, this was all before the invasion of Ukraine. Although the immediate response has been the predictable urge to rally round the flag, encouraged by strident state propaganda, as the realities of the war and news of the abuses carried out by Russian soldiers begin to become more widely known, it is likely the military’s reputation will face the same kind of slump that its Soviet counterpart experienced after the war in Afghanistan. ‘Cargo 200’ casualties tend quickly to change the public mood.

The Security State?

Besides, respect for the military does not necessarily translate into support for the regime, let alone its militarized foreign policy. A growing mood of disenchantment and even active protest ever since Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, despite the temporary boost in his ratings following the annexation of Crimea, has led to a commensurate dependence on repression and the security apparatus. As well as a greater use of the FSB and the separate Investigative Committee (SK: Sledstvenny Komitet), both of which have increasingly sought to police not just what Russians do, but what they say and think, this has also resulted in an increased emphasis on paramilitary domestic security forces that could also play a role outside Russia’s borders.

First and foremost, this means the National Guard, also called the Rosgvardiya as a contraction of its full name, the Federal Service of the Troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation (FSVNG RF: Federalnaya Sluzhba Voisk Natsionalnoi Gvardii Rossiiskoi Federatsii). This is not a reserve military force like its American counterpart, but a militarized internal security and public order force. Although the idea of establishing such a force had been mooted in the 1990s and 2000s, it was only in 2016 that it was actually created. This was essentially a bureaucratic and political manoeuvre. Existing forces that until then had been subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD: Ministerstvo Vnutrennykh Del) were transferred to an all-new agency, headed by Gen. Viktor Zolotov, the former head of Putin’s personal protection detail and a loyalist with a reputation for brutal zeal. The forces which make up the Rosgvardiya are the Interior Troops, the OMON riot police and the police Special Rapid Response Detachments (SOBR: Spetsialny Otryad Bystrovo Reagirovaniya), as well as the state corporation FGUP Okhrana, the country’s largest provider of private security. The reason for their resubordination to a new agency appears precisely to have been that the regular police who ran the MVD were increasingly disenchanted with playing the role of state stormtroopers. Putin wanted to be sure that if he did have to rely on mass repression, the relevant forces were in the hands of a man who would obey orders without question (or too much concern for the niceties of the law and constitution).

The Interior Troops (VV: Vnutrenniye Voiska) number around 170,000, of whom perhaps half are essentially static security personnel guarding everything from prisons to closed cities, but the other half, the so-called Operational Designation units, are mobile, light mechanized security forces. Most are organized into brigades or smaller elements, but the showcase force is the elite Moscow-based 1st Independent Operational Designation Division, still widely known as the ‘Dzerzhinsky Division’ since Soviet times. It has a strength of 15,000, with three mechanized regiments equipped with tanks and artillery, and the 604th Special Purpose Centre, a special forces unit formed in 2008 by combining two existing commando teams, Vityaz and Rus. Then, as well as the roughly 32,000 OMON riot police, there are also some 6,000 SOBR officers.

In Chechnya, the VV played a major part in both security and front-line roles, and in Syria it appears that many of the ‘Military Police’ present may actually be Interior Troops, drawn disproportionately from Chechnya and other North Caucasus nationalities. They are not trained or equipped for full-scale mechanized warfare of the sort they found themselves pitched into in Ukraine, though. They have suffered terrible losses there, and chatter on their social media fora suggests a growing anger at being used, as they put it, as ‘cannon-fodder’. In one high-profile case, 12 National Guardsmen from Krasnodar flatly refused to go to Ukraine, and were sacked – and they then took their commanders to court. Who knows how many less public cases there are, how many officers are simply resigning rather than be fed into the meatgrinder? It may well prove to have been a political blunder for the Kremlin to allow its Praetorian Guard to be so alienated.

A Weak hand played well?

His tight personal control over the security apparatus is only one of the reasons for Putin’s continued and seemingly incontestable grip on power, but an important one. For so long, the conventional truism was that he was ‘playing a weak hand well’. Russia cannot even think of matching the United States in the old games of global status. US naval power, airpower, soft power and economic power may all be losing their hyperdominance, especially in the face of a rising China, but they are still well beyond Russia’s capacity to match – trying to keep up bankrupted even the old Soviet Union. However, like good ‘geopolitical guerrillas’, the Russians instead sought to move the contest into new domains and develop new tools. This style of ‘political war’ may not have allowed Putin to define the new global order, but did give him disproportionate influence over his neighbourhood and forced the West to address the issues he wanted to discuss.

Yet Putin likely misunderstood how far this was not because of Russian strength but the product of a particular moment. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, there were transatlantic and intra-European tensions, the COVID crisis created new economic and social pressures, and the United States was still seeking to pivot to Asia. The invasion of Ukraine managed in one fell swoop to unite the West (at least for a while), galvanize NATO (and win it new members Sweden and Finland), remind Washington why Europe mattered, and undermine the freedom of manoeuvre on which Putin’s ‘political war’ games relied.

Furthermore, while Russia had managed to gain a temporary advantage in some technologies such as hypersonic weapons, technological advantages tend to shrink as rivals catch up or new developments supersede them. Artificial intelligence, which could dramatically shorten the ‘kill-chain’ from spotting a target to destroying it, and manage much more complex drone swarms. Quantum computing, which could so outperform the regular kind that any encryption could be broken and any communications intercepted. Additive manufacturing systems that could 3D print ammunition and equipment wherever and whenever needed in the field. All kinds of science fictional breakthroughs await, and even before sanctions, it was hard to see Russia being able to catch up, let alone keep up. While it has come to value the drone, and is working on all kinds of new projects, from individual exoskeletons to allow soldiers to carry heavy loads at speed, to ground-based autonomous robots for front-line resupply, guard and combat duties, these do not represent the kind of fundamental breakthroughs that could again reshape war.

Besides, does it have the flexibility, redundancy and seamless command and control needed to respond to such potential future threats as ‘mosaic warfare’? This is a warfighting approach being discussed in US military circles that seeks to overwhelm and disorganize the enemy by confronting it with a large, asymmetric and varied range of threats, all operating in their own distinctive way, like separate tiles in a mosaic. Instead of the most exquisitely capable systems, it puts the focus back on the small, the agile, the fluid, and the scalable: better many and innovative platforms that all have their own advantages. For every ridiculously expensive F-35 jet, for example, maybe the US will also deploy a half-dozen drones with different characteristics and weapons, creating a confusingly complex combat environment. Is the Russian High Command of the future up to this very different kind of warfighting, and comfortable with being the one on the receiving end of theoretical innovation?

Nor will Russia’s armed forces be able to retain what appeared to be their advantage in Europe after Ukraine. They had benefited from Putin’s commitment to spending heavily on rearmament and the High Command’s refusal to lose sight of a focus on ‘big wars’. With the war in Ukraine and consequent economic stagnation, it will not be able to spend in the same way, and the West has also rediscovered the ‘big war’. Western leaderships had been reluctant to give up the ‘peace dividend’ brought by the end of the Cold War – as late as 2021, 19 of NATO’s 29 members did not meet the common minimum level of defence spending, 2% of GDP – and military attention had shifted to ‘small wars’, intervention operations in the Middle East or Africa, where mobility, flexibility and hearts and minds operations were more important than mass, and where the enemy would not have airpower, armour or the rest of the panoply of a peer adversary.

That was beginning to change even before Ukraine, though. In 2011, for example, a cost-cutting Dutch army retired all its tanks. Later, it realized the mistake and made a deal with Germany that at least allowed it to form a squadron of 18 modern Leopard 2A7 tanks, with mixed Dutch and German crews. As for the UK, after some debate in which it looked as if it too might abandon the tank – far too heavy and temperamental for ‘small wars’, but invaluable in big ones – in 2021 it decided to upgrade 148 of its ageing Challenger 2 tanks to Challenger 3 standard. It is easy to say that this is too few, but nonetheless, the return in fashion of heavy metal was a sign of a changing attitude towards the kinds of threats NATO may face.

After Putin?

Having in many ways pioneered the use of asymmetric and deniable forms of warfare to complement the regular, Russia faces a real question as to how far it can handle more unconventional threats itself. Ukraine is outfighting it in the information war, and even its internal security forces cannot stop a domestic campaign of anti-war subversion. The war means more and more casualties coming home, and although the Kremlin has now squeezed out the last independent journalistic outlets, it cannot hide these for ever, especially in an age of social media. It also means inflation, unemployment and shortages thanks to Western sanctions. These two sources of grievance could combine in unpredictable and dangerous ways.

By the time this book comes out, Putin will be 70. Although constitutionally he can rule until 2036, when he would be 83, there are reasons to believe that he is getting tired of the position and its demands and, indeed, may be seriously ill. For that matter, his whole security elite is beginning to show its age. Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev will be 71, along with FSB director Alexander Bortnikov. Foreign Intelligence Service director Sergei Naryshkin will be 68. While both Shoigu and Gerasimov will be just 67, neither is looking especially comfortable as reverse after reverse happens in Ukraine.

One way or another, there will eventually be a political transition, and a new generation of political and military leaders will rise. While they will not necessarily be any less nationalistic, unlike their seniors they are not shaped by the trauma of the collapse of Soviet power and the dramatic reversal in their country’s fortunes. They appear to be more pragmatic, less emotional in their attitudes towards the West, and more aware of the potential challenge of a rising China. They will also have had an object lesson in what happens if the Kremlin over-reaches and see less advantage in confrontation. Besides, even if Russia is not a real democracy, they will have to consider the views and tolerance of their public.

Since 2014, Putin has been pushing a legitimating narrative predicated on the need to force the rest of the world to accept Russia’s status as a great power, whatever the cost in blood and treasure. However, polls conducted by the Levada Centre, the most respected independent public opinion company in Russia, found that when asked in 2021 what kind of country Russia should be, 66% said ‘a country with a high standard of living, though not one of the strongest countries in the world’. Only 32% replied ‘a great power that other countries respect and fear’. Furthermore, the proportion for whom quality of life is more important than national status has been growing ever since 2015.5

Of course, the immediate context of the Ukraine war has muddied the waters. Some feel they must defend their country. Others are afraid to say anything that might get them into trouble. Nonetheless, even as of writing in mid-2022, there is little sense of a genuine national will to sacrifice whatever it takes to build an empire on blood and bayonets. Putin may have believed he was founding a Eurasian Sparta, and he undoubtedly built a military machine able and willing to project his power in both Russia’s strategic neighbourhood and beyond. Yet just as that machine foundered in 2022, beaten between the anvil of Ukrainian resistance and the hammer of his own hubris, he may find his dreams for Russia equally broken by reality. Will Russia be able to retain its expeditionary force in Syria? Will it remain the security guarantor of Central Asia? Will it be able to afford to replace all the equipment squandered in Ukraine? Will, in due course, the colonels and the generals, maybe even the spies and secret policemen, themselves turn against Putin, not so much because he sought to break Kyiv to his will, but because he did it so badly?

The story of Putin’s presidency has been one of two halves. His first two presidential terms in the 2000s were strikingly successful, but so many of the gains made were wasted or embezzled away in the 2010s and beyond. So too with his military and security record. The Russian army was saved from collapse; Chechnya pacified, however ugly the means; and Moscow again became a power in global affairs. Had he been content with building a strong nation within its own borders rather than chasing fantasies of empire, Putin would likely have been remembered as a successful statebuilder. Instead, for years and perhaps decades, even under his eventual successor, Russia will still be recovering from the damage caused by his overreach. Its military, of course, but also its economy and its society will long bear the deep, painful scars of Putin’s wars.
