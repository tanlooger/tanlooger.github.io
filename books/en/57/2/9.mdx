title: 9 Serdyukov, the Enforcer
---



It was pretty difficult at the time to find a Russian officer with anything good to say about Anatoly Serdyukov, the rather podgy former head of the Federal Tax Service who replaced Ivanov as Defence Minister in February 2007. ‘The accountant’, they called him, ‘the taxman’ (because who loves the taxman?) or, more obscurely, ‘the furniture salesman’, because before moving into the Federal Tax Service in 2000, he had been the general director of a St Petersburg-based furniture company. In 2021, nine years after he had left the ministry, it was still hard to get anyone military to be especially generous about Serdyukov the man, but there was also a grudging recognition that the reforms he forced on an uncooperative military were both necessary and successful.

## Enter the Taxman

Serdyukov had served first as deputy chief and then chief of the St Petersburg Directorate of what was then still called the Tax Ministry, succeeding Viktor Zubkov, his father-in-law. Coming from the president’s home city and family patronage are, after all, two well-established routes to success in Putin’s Russia. Within four years, he had been appointed head of the whole Federal Tax Service, where he made a name for himself as a stickler for detail and an effective financial manager, and this was why Putin appointed him. As he said, when announcing Serdyukov’s promotion: ‘for effective management in modern conditions, for rational spending of huge amounts of budget money, you need a person with experience in the field of economics and finance.’1

His appointment as Defence Minister did come as a bombshell, though. He had no military experience, or apparent particular interest, and was not even well known in wider security circles, the so-called siloviki, or ‘men of force’. In fact, this was part of the reason for his selection, precisely because he had no existing ties to any factions within the military and would be dependent on pleasing the president. What the president wanted was results. More and more money was being spent on the armed forces, but there was little sense it was bringing about the kind of fundamental changes required to make Russia both secure within its borders and capable of projecting its will and power beyond them.

From the first, Serdyukov faced resistance. Indeed, Chief of the General Staff Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky hardly endeared himself to his new boss by suggesting publicly that before he gave a single instruction, he should spend a month being ‘trained up’ so that he would get a sense of the ‘job in hand’. Whereas Ivanov had often been too busy with other responsibilities to get too taken up with his personal relationship with the generals – and was sufficiently secure of Putin’s support not to take occasional snipes too seriously – Serdyukov was both a rather touchier individual and also well aware that he had to show the boss that he was up to this promotion and would not be cowed by the High Command.

## Serdyukov’s Purge

Serdyukov may not have known much about the military, but he did know bureaucracy and accounting very well. He instituted an audit of both ministry finances and also whether senior officers were indeed keeping up with their mandatory physicals. He brought in his own people, civilian specialists from the Federal Tax Service, to run the administrative side of the ministry, including his former deputy, Mikhail Mokretsov, as head of his political office and Tatyana Shevtsova and Vera Chistova as deputy ministers. He initiated something of a purge of the High Command, sacking Gen. Vladimir Mikhailov, head of the Air Forces, and the heads of three services especially notorious for their waste and corruption: Col. Gen. Vladislav Polonsky of the Main Armour Directorate (responsible for storage and maintenance), Gen. Igor Bykov of the Main Medical Directorate and Gen. Anatoly Grebenyuk of medical facility construction. Most importantly, in June 2007, Gen. Baluyevsky was dismissed, banished to a position in the Security Council Secretariat – which offered public honour but private impotence – and replaced as Chief of the General Staff with Gen. Nikolai Makarov. The taxman meant business, and never forgot a slight.

Despite – or perhaps because – of this bloodletting, the High Command were still not reconciled to the kind of dramatic reform that Serdyukov had been appointed to introduce. Furthermore, Putin was coming to the end of his second consecutive term as president, which meant that, by law, he had to stand down. There was considerable uncertainty as to what would happen, and whether he would simply try to have the constitution rewritten, but in any case the last months of 2007 were overshadowed by this issue, and Putin lacked the time or attention to put more political capital behind Serdyukov. Then, on 10 December 2007, he confirmed that he would stand down, and that his current prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, was his preferred successor. What followed was essentially a formality, especially after Medvedev made it clear that this would really be a job swap, with Putin becoming his prime minister. It was pretty obvious all along that Putin would continue to be the power behind the throne, with Medvedev’s election posters showing the two men side-by-side with the slogan Vmeste pobedim, ‘Together We Will Win’.

Medvedev was duly elected in March 2008 and inaugurated in May, but at first the status of the security agencies under what became known as the ‘tandemocracy’ was unclear. Constitutionally, they reported to the president, but it soon became clear that Putin, now ensconced in the (Russian) White House, was still their overseer. Later, for example, Baluyevsky would grumble that getting Medvedev to pull the trigger on the long-planned war against Georgia in 2008 would require Putin – who was on an official visit to Beijing at the time – getting on the phone to give him ‘a kick up the arse’.2 Either way, for some months it meant there was no unequivocal mandate for Serdyukov – some generals even over-optimistically hoped Medvedev might sack him.

As it was, he would remain in office for another four years and was brought down not by political intrigues or military resistance, but a simple sex scandal. There were allegations that he had been involved in a scam, whereby a state-controlled military contractor had sold assets to private firms at far below the market value, losing the government nearly 3 billion roubles (then equivalent to £62.5 million). This alone would not have been enough to bring him down, as the simple truth of the matter is that no senior Russian government figure does not engage in such schemes to supplement his or her salary. More seriously, when investigators staged a dawn raid on a key suspect, property department head Yevgeniya Vasilyeva, in her 13-room Moscow flat they found almost a million pounds’ worth of cash, antiques and jewellery – and Serdyukov in a dressing gown. Fraud is one thing; conducting an extra-marital affair when your wife is the daughter of Viktor Zubkov, a former prime minister, the current chair of the board of directors of Gazprom, Russia’s largest corporation, and a close ally of the president, is quite another. Zubkov demanded his head, and Serdyukov had to go, being sacked in November 2012. Nonetheless, in his own way, Putin is loyal to his own. Serdyukov had done what he had been charged to do, and so a subsequent conviction in another case, using army engineers to build a road to his son-in-law’s holiday home, was amnestied, and he was later found a comfortable sinecure with the Rostec arms corporation. (Vasilyeva had no such protection: she was sentenced to five years in prison.)

## And Enter Makarov

Nonetheless, Serdyukov had already managed to make progress. Medvedev had not been in a position to sack a defence minister Putin had appointed, even had he wanted to. However, nor did he have the political muscle or respect within the High Command to force them to accept the reform programme. So the deadlock had continued, even while those plans were being refined. Although these are associated with Serdyukov, Chief of the General Staff Makarov was really the driving force behind them. Born in 1949, Nikolai Makarov was a career infantry officer, who had served in a wide range of commands, from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany to being chief of staff of the Russian deployment to Tajikistan in 1993 and, in 2002, command of the massive Siberian VO. His progression up the ranks had consistently been faster than usual, and in 1999 Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev had singled him out for praise: ‘this general has a great future.’3 Nonetheless, in 2005, he had been appointed a deputy minister of defence in his new role as Chief of Armaments. To some, he was being side-lined from the main military command track to an administrative role, and there may be some truth to that, as Makarov had already been expressing his dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reform, and implicitly the efforts of many of his colleagues precisely to keep it slow. That may help explain why Serdyukov chose him as his Chief of the General Staff: he was a well-regarded field officer but also not part of the quiet opposition within the High Command.

Perhaps most disquieting of all for his peers, he was a man with ideas. When commanding the 2nd Guards Tank Army in 1996–98, he acquired a reputation for innovative training methods. Later, as commander of the Siberian VO, he pioneered less formal and bureaucratic processes for recruitment, precisely to try to attract more volunteers. As Chief of Armaments, he queried many of the illogical procurement decisions of the sort that were driven by politics and patronage rather than the needs of the military, reportedly including the ban on buying kit and components not coming from Russia or other post-Soviet states. The decision to buy T-90A tanks with more advanced ESSA thermal imaging systems built around the second-generation Catherine-FC array designed by the French company Thales, for example, was reportedly rammed through with his backing.4

This was an initiative with which Serdyukov would then be associated. The Russian military had not been entirely unwilling to adopt foreign-made equipment, but for reasons of pride, politics and security, this was typically avoided whenever possible. To a degree, Russia was still trapped in the frame of the Soviet-era military-industrial complex, which had often tended towards monopoly manufacturers, many of which ended up in other post-Soviet states. The Antonov concern, for example, which builds larger transport aircraft, was originally based in Novosibirsk in Russia, but was moved to Kyiv in 1952. Although some joint-venture work was continued after 1991, with the 2014 seizure of Crimea, all such collaboration ended. Likewise, Zorya-Mashproyekt in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv used to produce gas turbine engines for Russian warships. Generally, though, foreign purchases were limited to specialized equipment for specialized forces (such as Presidential Security Service snipers) and high-tech components such as the Catherine-FC imaging array. To deliver a warning shot to complacent and corrupt Russian corporations, as well as quickly bring some new capabilities to the field, Serdyukov began buying foreign kit, especially from countries Moscow hoped to woo. Thus, he green-lit the purchase of Italian FIAT-Iveco M65 Lince light tactical multi-role vehicles (which came into service as the Rys, the Russian for Lynx), most assembled in Voronezh, as well as two French Mistral-class amphibious assault ships and Israeli drones. The Mistral deal eventually fell foul of the political fall-out from Crimea: in 2015, Paris cancelled the deal and refunded Russia the equivalent of £590 million it had paid up-front. Although some of the specific items of kit were welcome, the policy overall was unsuccessful with the military and defence industries alike and was reversed when Serdyukov was sacked, although – sometimes by getting round sanctions and export controls – the Russians do still buy foreign kit for their special forces, such as Finnish Sako TRG and British Accuracy International AX338 sniper rifles.

Makarov was also not afraid to draw attention to some of the challenges of the training process. Conscripts are drafted in two annual cycles, in spring and autumn, and this leads to two training cycles, the summer and winter. In winter, recruits concentrate on basic individual and unit training, with the larger joint exercises largely scheduled in summer and early autumn, when the weather is rather more conducive. Overall, though, this training was much too dependent on rote learning and often unrealistic or choreographed exercises. While recruits may well have ended up physically fit and have mastered their basic skills, their capacity to work together in larger units and their officers’ experience in dealing with unpredictable and realistic situations was – and remains – distinctly limited. Once Chief of the General Staff, his tone would not soften, and he used an annual meeting of the Academy of Military Sciences as a chance to deliver a scathing review of a military in which only 17% of the Ground Forces and five of the Air Forces’ 150 regiments were combat-ready and half the navy’s ships were standing idle at anchor.5

## The Georgian Excuse

If the political stalemate within the military was not going to be settled from above, it would end up being broken by the course of events. Moscow had become increasingly exasperated with the neighbouring state of Georgia, whose firebrand president, Mikheil Saakashvili, was eager to see the country oriented more towards the West. As proxies, the Russians had been supporting the separatists of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Violence between the Georgian security forces and the South Ossetians had been escalating through the summer, likely at Moscow’s instigation. Saakashvili was not a man to take provocation lightly, and on 7 August, Georgian troops moved into South Ossetia and attacked its capital, Tskhinvali. In the process, Russian peacekeepers in the city were engaged, and two were killed.

This gave Moscow the pretext it needed to remind the Georgians that they were in what the Russians considered their sphere of influence. Forces that had been moved close to the border in preparedness were unleashed. However, the actual timing was deeply inconvenient for Moscow. Medvedev was on holiday and, as mentioned, Putin in China for the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. Furthermore, the General Staff’s Main Operations Directorate, its primary planning and coordination body, was in the middle of an office move. All this may have magnified the blunders that followed, as abandoned airfields were bombed, officers lost to friendly fire, and advances halted by broken-down vehicles.

As will be discussed in Chapter 11, the Russians certainly won this bitter five-day war, but that was essentially inevitable: the Georgian army had no more than 30,000 soldiers in total, of whom some 2,000 of their best were serving in Iraq alongside coalition forces. The Russians threw in more than twice as many troops, backed by thousands of South Ossetian and Abkhazian militia and overwhelming airpower. The point was that the Russians did far less well than they ought – and the self-evident proof of this gave Serdyukov and Makarov the opportunity at last to force their reforms through.
