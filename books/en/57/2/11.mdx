title: 11 Georgia, 2008 (2)：… Moscow’s Counter
---



Tbilisi had counted on speed to secure South Ossetia before Russia could react. That having failed, but unwilling to admit defeat after just a single day’s fighting, on 9 August government forces returned to the fray, cautiously and methodically in contrast to the previous day’s headlong rush. After a brief artillery barrage in the middle of the night, dawn saw the 2nd Brigade lead the renewed offensive, retaking the village of Khetagurovi south of Tskhinvali from a small Russian screening force. Having occupied Khetagurovi, they then inched north to Upper Nikozi, a village closer to the city, where they were met by the 41st Battalion and prepared to move on the city at around 1400 hours, as the Georgian artillery renewed its bombardment.

Meanwhile, the Russian advance guard had relieved the peacekeeping contingent. Two companies from the 135th Motor Rifle Regiment, accompanied by Lt. Gen. Anatoly Khrulyov, commander of the 58th Army and senior figure in the field, were moving towards the city, unaware that the Georgians were about to mount an attack. His convoy came under shellfire but pressed on, meaning that – unbeknown to each other – the Russians entered Tskhinvali from the west at the same time as the Georgians from the south. The 2nd Brigade’s reconnaissance company and one of Khrulyov’s blundered into each other, and although the government forces withdrew, the general was badly wounded. The main forces then engaged each other, and the Georgians’ superior numbers and tanks forced the Russians onto the back foot. Encircled and vulnerable to mortar fire, for a time their position looked untenable, but reinforcements were on the way. Spetsnaz and the GRU’s Vostok Battalion, a veteran force made up of Chechens who had joined Moscow’s side, infiltrated the city to support them, while artillery and airpower was committed to driving the Georgians back. Although the Russian artillery did suffer from counter-battery fire, they could rely on target designation from peacekeepers and Spetsnaz on the front line and began a withering barrage that forced back the 41st Battalion, which had been leading the attack.

By late afternoon, the Georgians had again withdrawn from the city. All day, Russian bombers had continued to hit targets both on and behind the front line. This included strikes by heavy Tu-22M bombers from the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment, one of which had been shot down by the Georgians, which had closed the Kopitnary airbase at Kutaisi in the west and also hit Gori. Although only 28 sorties were flown that day, and three aircraft lost (the other two to friendly fire again), they proved crucial in preventing the Georgians from exploiting the momentum of their initial assault on Tskhinvali. Along with a strike by a Tochka-U (SS-21) ballistic missile with a conventional cluster bomb warhead, which hit a Georgian force in the west of South Ossetia, they also served a political purpose, reminding Tbilisi of the Russians’ reach. While artillery exchanges would continue into the evening, the second full day of war had again seen a Georgian offensive repelled. It was a mark of Tbilisi’s desperation that it asked the United States to organize an emergency airlift home of the 2,000 soldiers of the 1st Brigade serving in Iraq.



The Tide Turns

Saakashvili’s gamble had failed, and any thought of restoring government control of South Ossetia had been dashed. Instead, the initiative swung to the Russians. The next day saw a major reinforcement as some 4,500 fresh soldiers from the 42nd Motor Rifle Division arrived, along with the 19th Motor Rifle Division’s 503rd Motor Rifle Regiment, two battalion tactical groups from the 76th Air Assault Division, elements of the 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade and ten Mi-24 gunships and Mi-8 assault transports from the 487th Helicopter Regiment. So numerous were these forces that there were even traffic jams on the road into Tskhinvali. By the end of 10 August, the city was solidly in their hands, with more than 10,000 Russian soldiers in-theatre.

The Georgian forces were in some disarray, but their mission shifted from attack to defence, units digging in along the front line. Tbilisi announced a formal end to its operation, but sporadic artillery duels continued, as did Russian air attacks. These were stepped up during the night of 10–11 August, destroying military and civilian radars to blind its air defences and hammering airbases. This was not simply as harassment but to prepare the ground for a Russian counter-attack, first to secure South Ossetia and then to go further.

To push back government forces so that they could not continue to shell Tskhinvali, the Russians assembled a brigade-strength task force from the 693rd Motor Rifle Regiment, the 70th Motor Rifle Regiment and the 234th Airborne Assault Regiment. On the morning of 11 August, they set out and, despite encountering some resistance, by late afternoon had reached and taken the village of Variani, some 15 kilometres into Georgian territory and the site of a strategically important government supply base. In a move of some desperation, the Georgians lofted all six of their Mi-24s to attack the advancing Russians, but while they made it safely back to base, they only destroyed two trucks and would not again be sent into battle.

The Russians began to dig in around Variani, anticipating a counter-attack, but instead the government forces were in a state of panic and confusion. On a tactical level, the Georgians often fought bravely and well, but a failure to train up a new generation of senior officers capable of coordinating large-scale operations was really beginning to tell. Furthermore, the political leadership failed to get ahead of the crisis. Saakashvili had been visiting Gori, and had been evacuated by his security detail when Russian warplanes were seen overhead. What was good enough for the president was good enough for his men, and shortly thereafter the substantial contingent of government troops in Gori also began to withdraw, most to Tbilisi and a few to Kutaisi. After all, the Russians were still coming, with their strength now reaching around 14,000, and the mood in the capital was sombre: what had started as a surgical campaign to reassert government control over a rebel region now looked like a fight for national survival. The Georgians intensified their efforts to win international support, their efforts compromised by a wave of cyber-attacks presumed to be emanating from Russia, with the Foreign Ministry’s website and emails compromised and Saakashvili’s own site defaced with images comparing him with Adolf Hitler. Some of these appear to have originated directly from Russian state agencies, but others were from so-called ‘patriotic hackers’ encouraged or instructed by the Kremlin to launch attacks on their own account.

Next day, the Russians resumed a methodical and essentially unopposed advance towards Gori, taking commanding heights over the city by mid-morning. Two conventionally armed Iskander (SS-26) short-range ballistic missiles were launched, one hitting the Marneuli airbase, another Gori’s main square. This had previously been a military staging point, but by then all the troops had left, and nine civilians were killed. As they advanced, the Russians found themselves seizing more and more abandoned military materiel, from US-made M16 rifles (which became popular trophies) to artillery pieces. Meanwhile, as the first of the 1st Brigade’s troops began to arrive at Tbilisi airport, the Georgian government stepped up its appeals for international support, diplomatic or otherwise, to prevent what it assumed was an imminent attack on the capital. Georgian forces, having rallied, dug in to defend it.

As it was, the Russians felt they had made their point. Just after midday on 12 August, President Medvedev announced that ‘the operation has achieved its goal, security for peacekeepers and civilians has been restored. The aggressor has been punished, suffering huge losses.’1 By 1500 hours, Russian artillery and airstrikes had ceased, and the war was effectively over. The next day, the Russians would occupy Gori, which had already been abandoned by the government forces, but after Saakashvili had signed a peace agreement brokered by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 15 August, signed by Medvedev the next day, they would be focusing on withdrawal. Of course, they did not go without confiscating all the materiel they could and destroying what they could not. Not only did the Georgian forces suffer some 2,000 casualties – including 182 military dead and 188 civilians – in the fighting, but the losses from this post-war ravaging of their equipment and stores exceeded those from fighting. All told, they lost dozens of tanks, APCs and other vehicles – mainly seized by the Russians. They also lost heavily on what was in many ways a neglected battlefront: Abkhazia.

The Abkhaz Front

While Tbilisi’s focus had been on South Ossetia, the Abkhazians – and the Russians – had spotted an opportunity. Initially, there had been uncertainty in Moscow and the Abkhaz capital of Sukhumi as to whether Saakashvili planned to kill two birds with the same stone. The 2nd and 5th Brigades and Interior Ministry forces west of South Ossetia could, after all, as easily have been ready to drive eastwards into Abkhazia. Hence Russia’s reinforcement of its peacekeeping contingent, as well as the Abkhazians’ decision to declare a state of emergency on the morning of 8 August, as the Georgians began their operation. Meanwhile, Russia’s 7th Airborne Assault Division in Novorossiisk, further north up the Black Sea coast, was ordered to stand up three battalion tactical groups for deployment to Abkhazia. By the end of the day, the first had already embarked on landing ships and was steaming south, escorted by two corvettes, the Mirazh and the Suzdalets, and two minesweepers. For heavier firepower, the missile cruiser Moskva, flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, began urgently to be prepared for action. Four more VDV battalions were later airlifted to Sukhumi, with the rest of the 7th Division transported there by rail, along a line Russian Railway Troops had repaired only that spring.

Although it quickly became clear that Tbilisi was concentrating its efforts on South Ossetia, neither Moscow nor Sukhumi wanted to waste a good opportunity to break Georgia’s small navy, hinder the campaign against Ossetia, and drive the Georgians out of the upper reaches of the strategic Kodori Gorge, which Abkhazia had been contesting with the government.

In pursuit of the first goal, first of all the Russians unveiled Tochka-U missiles that had secretly been moved to the coastal town of Ochamchire the year before. Two fitted with cluster warheads were launched against the Georgian naval base of Poti, to the south. Five sailors died, but the main aim seems to have been disruption and to encourage the patrol boats there to head for the relative security of the larger base at Batumi, even further south, rather than pose any risk to the flotilla bringing paratroopers and marines to Ochamchire.

On the afternoon of the 9th, Moscow formally warned that the Abkhaz coastline was now closed to all shipping, as the Moskva, escorted by the destroyer Smetlivy, set sail from Sevastopol. When four Georgian patrol boats sought to approach Ochamchire and the landing ships that were standing off the coast (it turned out that the harbour had become silted up, so the task force ended up having to disembark on the beach), the Mirazh engaged them with P-120 Malakhit (SS-N-9) missiles. Although Tbilisi denied it, the Russians claimed one was sunk, and this was probably the armed Coast Guard cutter Giorgi Toreli.

However, the crucial move would come from the land. Russian paratroopers moved south across the Abkhaz–Georgian border on 10 August, initially in connection with the Kodori Gorge operations described below. However, two days later, a special forces team from the 45th Independent Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment – the VDV’s own Spetsnaz – penetrated the port of Poti, where the bulk of the Georgian navy still lay at anchor. These ships had been abandoned, because their crews were anticipating further air attacks, and so the commandos were able to mine and sink fully six naval and Coast Guard ships, including the fast attack boats Tbilisi and Dioscuria, their most powerful assets.

There was relatively little that could be done to affect the Ossetian campaign, although an early strike on the 2nd Brigade’s base in Senaki did seriously disrupt efforts to muster reservists. Instead, the main additional effort by the Russian forces was put into supporting the Kodori campaign. The Abkhazians deployed the bulk of their forces (which after mobilization numbered some 9,000), supported from the air by helicopters and also their three still-operational L-39 trainer jets, fitted with unguided rockets and bombs. By the afternoon of the 9th, their forces were ready, and after a day of artillery bombardment, on the evening of the 10th they had begun to move into the disputed region of the Gorge. That same day, Russian paratroopers from the 7th Division moved into the Zugdidi region, south of Abkhazia. With a clear military advantage, they negotiated an essentially bloodless occupation of the area, and then took Senaki the next day, where the 2nd Brigade’s base had been evacuated. A reinforced company subsequently swung north to close the other mouth of the Gorge. Finding themselves boxed in, the Georgian police and soldiers there largely laid down their weapons and left the Gorge; the Russians let them go. The next day, the Abkhazians swept through the Gorge, flushing out the few remaining pockets of resistance, as Georgian deputy interior minister Eka Zhguladze claimed they were withdrawn as a ‘goodwill gesture’.2 Only two Georgians died, and one Abkhazian (in an accident), but by 12 August, the Gorge was essentially in Sukhumi’s hands and this separate little war was over.

The Audit

On 26 August, Moscow formally recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states – a decision rejected by the international community – and acquired military protectorates that occupy one-fifth of Georgia’s territory, and the constant opportunity to cause more trouble for Tbilisi, should it want to. Both regions’ borders are now also monitored by permanent FSB Border Troops posts. There is also a Russian military presence in both regions. In Abkhazia, the 7th Military Base outside Gudauta was formed from the 131st Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, strengthened with new T-90A tanks and S-300PS SAM systems, while the Black Sea Fleet also operates small patrol vessels out of Ochamchire. In North Ossetia, the 693rd Motor Rifle Regiment of the 19th Motor Rifle Division became the basis for the 4th Military Base, along with additional forces including a rocket artillery battery.

In return, the Russians lost no more than 74 dead (figures are contradictory, and some put it in the low 60s), the Georgians more than twice as many, along with large amounts of materiel – including Humvees supplied by the United States – and much of their navy. More to the point, Moscow had demonstrated the will and capacity to use a short, sharp dose of force to punish a neighbour that failed to toe the line.

Saakashvili, predictably enough, would later try to spin defeat as a near-victory, claiming that ‘the Russian 58th Army was actually burned by the 4th (Georgian) Brigade’.3 He was wrong, but nonetheless Moscow was not exulting in its victory. That it had won against a country one-twentieth of its size and when it stuck to limited and achievable objectives was not a surprise. Instead, what quickly became clear to the High Command was that it had not done anywhere near as well as it should.

The whole effort was nowhere near as well coordinated as it should have been. The Russians had known that the Georgians would strike some time, but had not known exactly when. As it was, when it happened, the General Staff’s Main Operations Directorate (GOU: Glavnoye Operativnoye Upravleniye), its primary organ for planning and organizing operations, was actually in the middle of an office move. Serdyukov had been suspicious of the GOU’s former chief, Col. Gen. Alexander Rukshin, whom he felt was too close to dismissed Chief of the General Staff Baluyevsky. By extension, he was wary of the GOU, and after dismissing Rukshin in June, he took his time selecting a successor. Worse yet, he pushed through swingeing 40% cuts to the GOU and, adding insult to injury, forced them to relocate to smaller offices. When Georgian troops started moving, most of the GOU’s files were locked away in secure packing crates packed onto a dozen KamAZ trucks, plus the ZAS secure-traffic telephones in their old offices had been cut off, and their new ones had not yet been connected.

Suddenly, military orders of the greatest secrecy were having to be transmitted by civilian cellphone. Chief of Staff Makarov was accused of having forgotten to activate the Air Forces at the same time as he ordered the Ground Forces to move, and only belatedly made good his mistake when prompted, which may explain why the first expeditionary forces were without air cover. Furthermore, command decisions over the Air Force were being made not in the field but by Col. Gen. Alexander Zelin, head of the Air Force Main Staff, by phone from his office. Fortunately for Moscow, the operational plans had already been developed and circulated – ironically enough, by the GOU – and in North Caucasus VO commander Col. Gen. Sergei Makarov (no relation) and 58th Army commander Lt. Gen. Anatoly Khrulyov they had competent, aggressive and experienced men who were willing and able to take the initiative.

It is worth noting, though, that Serdyukov and his Chief of the General Staff did not suffer as a result of this chaos, both because they did win their war and also because there was more than enough blame and inefficiency to go around. Makarov, for example, was scathing about the problem of finding suitable command personnel:

In order to find one person at the rank of lieutenant colonel, colonel, or general who could ably command troops, it was necessary to search one-by-one through the armed forces, because the full-time commanders who were sitting around leading ‘paper regiments and divisions’ simply were not in a condition to resolve issues that arose during the five-day war. And when you did send them troops and equipment, they were simply confused, and some even refused to execute their assigned tasks.4

This was ungenerous, but not wholly inaccurate. Certainly the forces in this war often made heavy weather of basic inter-unit cooperation, and were thus especially vulnerable to Georgian ambushes and counter-attacks, such as the one that left Khrulyov trapped and seriously wounded. This lack of coordination often reflected patchy and dated communications in the field: at one point Khrulyov even had to borrow a satellite phone from a journalist to give orders. Units on the ground found they could not talk to aircrews above them, contributing to friendly fire incidents such as the very first loss, a Su-25 downed by Russians using shoulder-fired SAMs on the evening of 8 August – because the ground troops had not been told that they were now receiving air cover and they assumed this was a Georgian attack. All told, of the six aircraft Russia lost in the war, three Su-25s, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3, half were casualties of friendly fire. (And two helicopters were lost when a Border Troops Mi-8 hit a M-24 on the ground when coming in for a night landing on 16 August.)

Did Anything Work Well?

There were serious problems with breakdowns and malfunctions beyond the Russian communications systems. Many vehicles of the 58th Army never even made it to Ossetia because they would not start or broke down on the way. Although the T-72M tanks deployed were notionally fitted for advanced reactive armour able to defeat man-portable anti-tank weapons, in practice the canisters which would hold the explosive charges meant to disrupt incoming warheads were usually empty. Half the bombs dropped on Kopitnary and Senaki airfields failed to explode. The litany is a long one.

For example, although it had seen limited use over Chechnya, the Georgian War saw the first real operational use of the Yakovlev Pchela (‘Bumblebee’) drone, originally developed in the late Soviet era but only fielded in 1997. Boosted from a launch ramp by rocket, it can loiter for up to two hours, streaming back real-time video footage from a TV and thermal imaging camera in a blister under its nose. Earlier versions used in Chechnya had had some successes, but its two-stroke two-cylinder piston engine was noisy and it could not fly high, leaving it especially vulnerable to high crosswinds in Chechnya’s mountain passes. Only eight combat sorties were flown, and two of the drones were shot down by rebel anti-aircraft fire. There were higher hopes of the newer Pchela-1T version, which was specifically intended for the VDV. However, it signally failed to impress paratrooper Col. Valery Yakhnovets, who was responsible for its field testing in Georgia. In his own words: ‘the first drone crashed to the ground, having barely taken off’, the second streamed back such unclear footage that the operators couldn’t even spot their own column of armoured personnel carriers, while it flew ‘so low it seemed you could hit it with a slingshot, and it “growled” like a BTR’. In short, in his opinion, ‘its effectiveness is zero and the Airborne Forces do not need it’.5 Later Russian drones would prove a good deal more effective, and welcomed by their users, but it seems to have taken a disastrous combat debut really to force the military to identify what worked and what did not.

Then there were basic failures of training. Although most of the forces deployed in Georgia were professionals, they often showed little greater skill or aptitude than conscripts. Almost as many Russian casualties were actually sustained in road crashes and other accidents as from Georgian artillery. It is not just that aircraft were downed by friendly fire, but that there was also a number of incidents in which Russian units fired on each other because of poor communications or fire discipline. Indeed, speaking of fire discipline, some units expended their entire basic load of ammunition in just 12 hours, and as resupply was every bit as haphazard as everything else, in some cases they had to be rotated out of harm’s way as a result. In the middle of battle, this could have disastrous consequences. The commander of a tank platoon admitted that he lost two of his T-72s in Upper Nikozi because ‘we simply ran out of ammunition, and they surrounded us with grenade launchers’.6

In short, for a minister who had been looking for a stick long enough and heavy enough to beat his High Command into submission and force them to accept painful reforms, this was just the kind of war Serdyukov needed.
