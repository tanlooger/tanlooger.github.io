title: 7 The Second Chechen War
---



Chechen rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov went on to become Chechnya’s prime minister before winning the presidency in 1997 by a landslide victory, but it proved easier to defeat the Russians than control his own people and make a success of the uneasy peace that followed the 1996 Khasavyurt Accord.1 Ultimately, he could win a war, but not the peace. Chechnya was in ruins, and the warlords who had emerged in the first war were unwilling to stand down. Worse yet was the rise of jihadists. While most Chechens were, like Maskhadov, Muslims, they held to a relatively moderate form of their faith. During the first war, though, local extremists had found common cause with foreign jihadists, including some linked to the Al-Qaeda terrorist movement.

The most notorious was Saudi-born Thamir Saleh Abdullah Al-Suwailem, who assumed the nom de guerre of Emir Khattab. He had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, where he met Osama Bin Laden and became an Al-Qaeda troubleshooter, seeing action in Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and the former Yugoslavia. In 1995, he had entered Chechnya under the guise of a journalist and began training Chechens as well as distributing funds and weapons provided by Al-Qaeda. He built up a network of local allies, including perhaps the most famous of the Chechen field commanders, Shamil Basayev. Khattab was not committed to Chechen independence as such, but to raising a general jihad across the North Caucasus to drive out Christian Russia and create an Islamic caliphate. As such, Maskhadov’s moderation, his willingness to try to make a success of the peace rather than commit to a renewed struggle, made him Khattab’s enemy. He was likely behind several of the assassination attempts made on Maskhadov’s life, but his real influence was to encourage cross-border raids into neighbouring Russian regions. In August 1999, Khattab and Basayev led a mixed force of some 1,500 Chechen, Dagestani and Arab fighters across the border into Dagestan. Calling themselves the ‘International Islamic Peacekeeping Brigade’, they proclaimed the ‘Islamic State of Dagestan’, then advanced on Botlikh, the nearest town.

They seem to have expected to be welcomed as liberators; they were wrong. Even before federal forces could respond, heavily armed locals converged on their positions. A combined contingent of the MVD’s 102nd Interior Troops Brigade, Dagestani police and Russian Spetsnaz, backed by air support, drove them back, and then countered a second attempted incursion in September. This played into the hands of a Russian government that had been waiting for an excuse to avenge itself for its earlier defeat.

Maskhadov disavowed and condemned the attacks, but nonetheless Russian bombers launched punitive missions first on border villages where the International Islamic Peacekeeping Brigade had mustered, then on Grozny. Meanwhile, Putin – then still prime minister, but looking for a chance to demonstrate his resolve and his capacity to turn around Russia’s fortunes – instructed his generals to muster for war. They had, after all, prepared contingency plans, and while the North Caucasus Military District (SKVO: Severo-Kavkazsky Voyenny Okrug) had, like every field command, suffered cuts as a result of budget crises and draft-dodging, its commander, Lt. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, had clearly been given a mandate to strengthen its combat capability. His friend, patron and predecessor in charge of the SKVO, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, had been responsible for the initial and disastrous attack on Grozny in 1994 and was determined to atone for his earlier failure. In 1997, he had become Chief of the General Staff, and he made sure that what resources he could divert to the district, he would. By the beginning of 1998, for example, volunteer soldiers, kontraktniki, made up 20–30% of the SKVO’s complement, a relatively high figure for such a command. In addition, the Daryal mountain warfare training centre in nearby North Ossetia, abandoned in 1992, was reopened. They were training for a renewed conflict, and in July 1998 even mounted a major exercise across the North Caucasus in which 15,000 army and MVD troops practised fighting ‘terrorists’.

## Round Two

The September apartment bombings discussed in the previous chapter and the Dagestan incursion left the Russian people anxious and angry, and this gave Putin the opportunity to strike. After all, he had made it clear what his priorities were when he told journalists, using the criminal slang ‘soaked’ for wiped out, that:

We will hunt the terrorists everywhere ... If you’ll excuse me, if we catch them in the toilet, we’ll soak them in the toilet, if that’s what it takes. It will all be finally sorted.2

On 1 October, he formally declared Maskhadov and the Chechen government illegitimate and reasserted the authority of the Russian Federation over its wayward subject, as the newly formed Joint Group of Federal Forces (OGFV: Obedinennaya Gruppa Federalnykh Voisk) was completing its muster, comprising Spetsnaz and a regiment each of the 2nd, 3rd, 20th, 27th and 34th Motor Rifle Divisions and the 4th Guards Tank Division, the 205th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, and also three Independent Operational Designation Brigades of the MVD Interior Troops (21st, 22nd and 33rd), the ‘Rosich’ 7th VV Special Forces Detachment and OMON riot police.

Overall command was under Lt. Gen. Kazantsev, and instead of the foolhardy direct assault of the first war, his plan was a staged and brutally methodical one. The first phase was as far as possible to seal Chechnya’s borders, while forces were assembled. All told, these numbered some 50,000 regular military troops and another 40,000 MVD VV and OMON riot police, some three times as many men as had taken part in the 1994 invasion. While Maskhadov was trying and failing to persuade Moscow to talk peace, the OGFV first occupied a cordon sanitaire along Chechnya’s northern border, then advanced to the Terek River, occupying the northern third of the country, with the regular army leading the advance, the MVD forces securing their rear.

The presence of the specialist riot police of the OMON, which originally stood for the Special Designation Police Unit (Otryad Militsii Osobennovo Naznacheniya), has been a distinctive feature of Russian military operations, even in Ukraine. Formed in 1989, they acquired something of a reputation as the heavy-handed stormtroopers of the state in the decaying years of the USSR. They were also used in high-risk policing missions, such as raids on organized crime hideouts, but in the desperate search for combat-ready forces in the First Chechen War, OMON in their distinctive blue tiger-striped urban camouflage and black berets were increasingly widely used. They were treated as light infantry, especially in the kind of operation known as a zachistka, a ‘clean up’, in which a village or neighbourhood would be surrounded and then subjected to a house-by-house search. They would again be deployed in the Second Chechen War, especially for rear-area security and urban operations. Because these units were locally raised across Russia, their training, skill and discipline varied widely, with some being accused of especially serious human rights violations. It also meant that they often had trouble cooperating. This led to some serious friendly fire incidents, the worst of which took place in Grozny, in March 2000. OMON from Podolsk ambushed a convoy of OMON from Sergiyev Posad coming to relieve them, believing them to be insurgents. In the ensuing firefight, 24 OMON were killed. Incorporated into the new National Guard in 2016 (still called OMON, now standing for Otryad Mobilnyy Osobovo Naznacheniya, ‘Special Designation Mobile Unit’), these approximately 30,000 officers, all professionals and most army veterans, are still routinely deployed for security sweeps across the North Caucasus, as well as their usual public security missions.

Resistance was sporadic and localized, in part because many Chechen fighters pulled back to Grozny after it became clear that the Russians were no longer so prone to leaving themselves open to ambush. Scouts and helicopters reconnoitred routes in advance, potential ambush sites were pre-emptively shelled, and tank forces were accompanied by vigilant infantry screens. As towns and villages were taken, they would be searched, and MVD forces left behind as garrisons to ensure the security of the Russian rear. On 12 October, the OGFV pushed across the Terek, advancing towards Grozny along three axes. The Western Group pushed through the Nadterechny district until it reached the western suburbs of Grozny; the Northern Group pushed down across the Terek at Cherevlyonnaya; while the Eastern Group swung past Gudermes and likewise moved to flank Grozny from the east.

While Maskhadov declared martial law and prepared his forces, the Russians slowly encircled the city. While it came under sporadic but heavy bombardment, including strikes by OTR-21 Tochka short-range ballistic missiles with conventional warheads, Kazantsev was in no hurry to send his mechanized forces into Grozny’s streets. Instead, he slowly expanded their area under his control, and his forces began to be augmented with local allies. After all, years of in-fighting in Chechnya, and the rise of the jihadists, had eroded their unity. A number of powerful figures and clans that had lost out were willing to throw in their lot with Moscow. The city of Gudermes, for example, fell largely thanks to the defection of the Yamadayevs, the dominant local family of the Benoi clan. The GRU (Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnyoe Upravlenie, the Main Intelligence Directorate) took them under its wing, and their private army would become the basis of the Vostok (East) Battalion. Likewise Ahmad Kadyrov, who had been a supporter of Dudayev’s in the first war, switched sides, along with his followers, who numbered several hundred but had grown to 3,000 by 2003.

## Retaking Grozny

Towns that did not surrender faced siege and bombardment, amidst the bitter North Caucasus winter. Argun fell in early December, followed by Urus-Martan. Of course, this strategy gave the rebels time to prepare. They fortified Grozny, digging trenches, laying mines, building fortified positions inside some buildings and booby-trapping others, drawing on the lessons of the first war. However, the Russians had also learnt their lessons. First of all, they launched high-altitude reconnaissance flights over the city, and where they were identified, rebel strongpoints were pounded by aircraft, artillery or more long-range Scud and OTR-21 missiles. At peak, they were firing up to 4,000 shells and rockets a day into the city. Thermobaric rockets fired by the TOS-1 ‘Buratino’, which release and then ignite an aerosolized cloud of explosive, were especially feared, as one could bring down a whole apartment building – however few might still have been standing.

By early December, only some 40,000 civilians were left in the ruins of a city that back in 1989 had been home to ten times as many. There were also around 2,500 rebels, against whom Kazantsev planned to launch 5,000 federal troops, along with around 2,000 MVD troops and OMON as well as about as many pro-Moscow (or at least anti-rebel) Chechen fighters in a militia commanded by Beslan Gantemirov. A convicted embezzler who had been pardoned in return for his service, he had recruited a force of volunteers, patriots, mercenaries, opportunists and criminals whom Moscow trusted little – the MVD only issued them out-dated AKM-47s from reserve stocks – but who nonetheless knew the city and were as fierce and flexible as Maskhadov’s men.

On 12 December, Kazantsev began his assault. First, reconnaissance and Spetsnaz patrols went in to spot for airstrikes and artillery, then his main force – the 506th Motor Rifle Regiment and two MVD VV brigades – swept in. First they took Khankala airbase, then began probing the centre. It was impossible to avoid Chechen ambushes such as the one which killed Maj. Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev, commander of the Northern Group. However, the OGFV was much more cautious, and the new T-90 tank proved much more resistant to RPGs than the old T-80, one even surviving seven hits. Troops moved forward methodically, checking for rebels hiding in cellars and rooftops and making sure no units advanced too far from their support. Soldiers wore identification armbands to reduce the risk of friendly fire, and better communications were established between army, OMON and VV troops. The fighting was fierce, but Kazantsev had the luxury of being able to cycle in fresh troops. After a week’s close-quarters fighting, about a quarter of the soldiers of the 506th had been killed or wounded, so he withdrew it and threw the fresh troops of the 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment into their place.

By the end of January, running low on men, ground to retreat and ammunition, the rebel commanders opted to abandon the city, regroup at the village of Alkhan-Kala south-west of Grozny and make for the highlands in the hope of following the same trajectory as in the first war. Many never made it, trapped by OMON on the outskirts of Grozny, chased by Spetsnaz, or caught in minefields outside Alkhan-Kala.

By 6 February, the Russians formally declared Grozny ‘liberated’. Nonetheless, the city was in ruins and it would take a month for OMON and Gantemirov’s militia to mop up a few remaining hold-outs in the city and a year for all the bodies from the battle to be found and buried. Unlike during the first war, now the Russians had taken Grozny, they would not let it go. The city was swamped both with federal forces and allied Chechens, while roving patrols on land and in the air watched the outskirts to prevent another infiltration. To mark Yeltsin’s inauguration as re-elected president in 1996, the rebels had retaken Grozny. While Putin was being inaugurated on 7 May 2000, the main phase of the war had been won.

## Operation Wolf Hunt

While Grozny was under siege, the federal forces had been consolidating their hold on the northern and central regions of the country under the rubric of Operation Wolf Hunt, going after the rebels who fled Grozny and then remaining hold-outs. The MVD was establishing not just its own network of strongpoints and Interior Troop and OMON garrisons, but also launching aggressive patrols and search operations to locate rebels, arms caches and safe houses. When some rebels tried to flee north from Grozny, they were met with patrols able to block, intercept and eliminate them.

However, the next priority was to take the unruly southern highlands, which in the past had been havens for the rebel forces. In April 2000, Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev was appointed head of the OGFV. A hard-fighting and tough-talking tank commander, who had commanded during the first war, he would become notorious for his public pronouncements, proposing that Grozny should be left in ruins as a warning to others, and that rebels ought to face public execution: ‘This is how I’d do it: I would gather everyone in the square, then I would have hoisted the bandit, and let him hang, let everyone see!’3 Nonetheless, from his experiences in the first war, he appreciated that conquering Chechnya was not the same as pacifying it, and that this would be a long haul.

The Russians’ best estimate was that there were still some 2,000–2,500 rebels on the loose, but any easy assumption that they were too scattered to pose any serious challenge was mistaken. The rebels could still cohere in units numbering several hundred and engage in operations which could cause serious Russian casualties. For example, one of the last major pitched engagements of the war took place in March, at Komsomolskoye, a village south of Grozny and the home village of warlord Ruslan Gelayev. An OMON unit from Russia’s Yaroslavl Region first encountered Gelayev and his men there, as they prepared to break through to the cover of the Argun Gorge. Once their numbers became clear – estimates ranged from 500 to 1,000, but the real figure was closer to 600 – the OMON settled for trapping them in the city and calling for support. They were promptly reinforced by a VV regiment and more OMON and special police units. After four days of almost constant bombardment, including attacks by Su-25 ground-attack jets and salvoes from TOS-1 launchers, they stormed the village. Nonetheless, it took another week and a further bombardment before Komsomolskoye was pacified, and a wounded Gelayev still managed to slip out of the village. For its size, this was one of the bloodiest battles of the war, with the official butcher’s bill being 552 Chechens and more than 50 Russians. The village itself was all but levelled; journalist Anna Politkovskaya called it ‘a monstrous conglomerate of burnt houses, ruins, and new graves at the cemetery’.4

More often, though, the rebels would simply mount ambushes and hit-and-run attacks. With 80,000 soldiers and security police deployed across the country, the environment became increasingly hostile for them. There would inevitably be successes. On 19 August 2002, for example, a small group of rebels with one of their few remaining Igla (SA-16) shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) managed to bring down one of the Russians’ Mi-26 transport helicopters as it approached Khankala airbase. The Mi-26 is a mammoth of the air, usually capable of carrying 90 soldiers and five crew, but this was overladen, with 142 soldiers being brought in as part of a troop rotation. In tragic irony, it crashed inside a minefield around a Russian command post, and between the impact, the fire when aviation fuel leaked into the crew compartment, and the mines, 127 died in what was up to then the Russian military’s most deadly aviation disaster.

More often, though, the successes were minor and the retaliation devastating, and meanwhile, the rebel commanders were one by one being, as the Russians put it, ‘neutralized’, as often by covert operations as direct military action. Khattab, who had survived being blown up by a landmine and shot in the stomach, was killed in March 2002 when an FSB undercover agent passed him a letter steeped in poison. Self-styled Chechen president in exile Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had fled to Qatar, but in February 2004, GRU agents killed him by placing a bomb under his car. In 2005, Maskhadov died during a commando attack by FSB forces on a hideout in Tolstoy-Yurt, probably at the hand of his nephew and bodyguard, who had orders to shoot him rather than let him be captured. Basayev was blown up in July 2006 when a mine exploded as he inspected it.

## The Creation of ‘Kadyrovstan’

As the remnants of the rebels became increasingly leaderless, hopeless and marked for capture or elimination, Moscow was looking to its own Chechen allies to stabilize the country. In June 2000, Putin had appointed a former rebel, Ahmad Kadyrov, as the interim head of the Chechen government. He had been the Chief Mufti of Chechnya in the inter-war era, but had fallen foul of the extremist Wahhabist strain of Islam that had become increasingly dominant, so he and his son Ramzan defected to the government’s side in 1999. His personal militia, the so-called Kadyrovtsy (‘Kadyrovites’), were originally just one of several such loyalist forces, but as the Kadyrovs became increasingly dominant, the others were forced to join or be disbanded.

Ahmad Kadyrov was formally sworn in as Chechen President in 2003, but he was killed the next year, when rebels detonated a bomb under the podium at the Dinamo football stadium, during the annual Victory Day parade. While Ramzan was too young formally to succeed, this was clearly on the cards. Things had become personal, and he and the Kadyrovtsy energetically set to wiping out the remnants of the rebels – and any political rivals – in the process. In 2007, after his 30th birthday, he was officially declared President, and since then he has held Chechnya in his ruthless, if capricious grip.

On 16 April 2009, Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee formally declared the ‘counter-terrorist operation’ in Chechnya over, in effect declaring victory. Admittedly, just as during the First Chechen War, the rebels tried to use terrorism outside Chechnya’s borders as a way of bringing the war to Russia. Most notoriously, in October 2002, 40 terrorists seized the Dubrovka theatre in Moscow, taking some 850 hostages. After two days of failed negotiations, a narcotic gas was pumped into the building, which was then stormed by the Alfa counter-terrorist team. The terrorists were killed, but 179 hostages died, almost all because of miscommunication, the medical first responders not having been told which gas was used and thus not giving the right treatment. In September 2004, 32 terrorists seized School Number One in the North Ossetian town of Beslan on the first day of the new school year. Of the 1,100 hostages taken, most were children. On the third day of the ensuing siege, when one of the terrorists’ bombs exploded, the building was stormed: 334 hostages died, including 186 children. However, while during the first war the authorities had been willing to compromise, under Putin the Kremlin took a tough line and continued its campaign in Chechnya. Since then, there have been isolated attacks connected with the war, often suicide bombings, such as the 2009 derailing of the Nevsky Express high-speed train from Moscow to St Petersburg, which killed 27, or the 2011 suicide bombing at Moscow’s Domodedovo airport, which left 37 dead. Taking their lead from Putin – who, after Beslan, said that in the past ‘We showed ourselves to be weak. And the weak get beaten’ – the authorities have refused to compromise with terrorists, and such attacks remain rare.5

In Chechnya itself, the insurgency had indeed been broken. Those few who remained tended to be jihadist extremists – in 2007 they had declared a ‘Caucasus Emirate’ – and the centre of insurgent gravity shifted to other republics of the North Caucasus. Russian forces in Chechnya were steadily reduced to around 10,000 soldiers, in the 46th Brigade of what was the MVD Interior Troops and is now the National Guard, and the regular military’s 42nd Motor Rifle Brigade. Most forces in Chechnya, while technically police or Interior Troops units, are really Kadyrovtsy: the 141st ‘Ahmad Kadyrov’ Special Purpose Police Regiment in Grozny, the 249th Independent Special Motorized Battalion ‘Yug’ (South) in Vedeno, the 424th IOD Brigade and 359th Independent Special Police Motorized Battalion in Grozny and several independent battalions: the 360th (Shelkovskaya), 743rd (Vedeno) and 744th (Nozhai-Yurt). These wear regular Interior Troop uniforms and are now formally subordinated to the North Caucasus National Guard District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, but they swear personal oaths of fealty to Kadyrov and in practice it is widely acknowledged that their primary loyalty is likely to be to him.

However, the irony is that in order to defeat the rebellion, the Kremlin may have granted Chechnya more autonomy in practice than it has had in the past two centuries. Kadyrov never fails loudly to proclaim his loyalty to President Putin, but in reality he rules Chechnya as he sees fit, while receiving generous federal subsidies from Moscow that he ploughs into vanity projects (the Ahmad Kadyrov Mosque in Grozny is one of the largest in Russia), living a high life and rewarding his cronies. From time to time, the government looks as if it is losing patience with its Chechen warlord, such as when his men gunned down opposition figure Boris Nemtsov literally outside the Kremlin in 2015. Each time, though, it has backed down, fearing that attempts to unseat him would force them to wage a third Chechen war.

Of course, they may only be postponing it. Back in 1995, in the midst of the First Chechen War, Gen. Kvashnin certainly seemed to think so:

We will beat the Chechens to pulp, so that the present generation will be too terrified to fight Russia again. Let Western observers come to Grozny and see what we have done to our own city, so that they shall know what may happen to their towns if they get rough with Russia. But you know, … in 20–30 years a new generation of Chechens that did not see the Russian army in action will grow up and they will again rebel, so we’ll have to smash them down all over again.6

## Lessons Learned

In the meantime, it is clear that the Russians had learned lessons from the earlier debacle, and from their rematch, as well. Some of these were technical and tactical. New weapons and equipment made an appearance, from body armour to reconnaissance drones. Then, Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) had had trouble engaging targets on upper stories of tower blocks without commanders having to expose themselves to fire by popping their hatches to use top-mounted machine guns. This time, they advanced into cities accompanied by gun trucks mounting ZU-23 23mm anti-aircraft guns able to rake the rooftops. Where tanks had previously been painfully vulnerable to close-range RPG attacks, now they were fitted with reactive armour and accompanied by infantry support. Special ‘storm detachments’ were established for the specialized experiences of urban warfare, of 30–50 men apiece, typically divided into teams of five, including one sniper and one man with an RPG or an RPO-A Shmel incendiary rocket launcher. Meanwhile, Spetsnaz anti-sniper teams used rocket launchers and their own snipers to pick off Chechen marksmen. More broadly, adopting a more methodical approach than the first war’s ‘dash for Grozny’, the federal forces were also much more effectively coordinated.7

The lessons were also political. The official butcher’s bill for the first war was 5,500 police and soldiers dead, with another 5,200 in the second. Admittedly, these figures have been questioned, not least as they may omit those dying of their wounds later in hospital. These figures were serious enough, but they also led to serious resistance to conscription: in 2000 alone, draft-dodging rose by 50%. However, the political effects were largely managed, to a considerable degree because the Kremlin took much greater care to control the narrative. While there were courageous journalists who risked their lives – and lost them – reporting on the realities on the ground, there was much wider use of censorship, ‘housetrained’ journalists and carefully framed narratives to present this as a war forced on Russia by Chechen gangsters and jihadists, and fought as expeditiously as possible.

This was helped by the ‘Chechenization’ of the war. The various Chechen contingents not only took many casualties that otherwise might have fallen to federal forces, but they brought local knowledge and undeniable enthusiasm to the war, seeing this often as a chance to satisfy blood feuds and win political status. The presence of these forces also allowed disaffected or demoralized rebels to switch sides, rather than forcing them to fight to the death. Besides, by elevating the Kadyrovs, the Kremlin’s claim to be fighting a war to restore a legitimate Chechen order looked more plausible.

The reason why this mattered was that this war would not only consolidate Putin’s status as a tough, even ruthless defender of Russia’s interests, but also established certain assumptions about the use of force. Putin’s willingness to visit the North Caucasus to be seen with the troops, and his street-slang references to the Chechens, all these did his macho reputation no harm. However, the outrage expressed by the West at the brutal tactics used to subjugate Chechnya also played a role in shaping his views on geopolitics. First of all, he felt this was hypocrisy and bad faith considering, as he saw it, his willingness to let Washington wage its war against Al-Qaeda however it wanted to. He felt Chechnya was his front in the ‘Global War on Terror’, and seems to have been genuinely offended when Western governments questioned his methods. However, he also noted that the West stuck to stern words and diplomatic expressions of grave concern. He began to believe that, especially when faced with a fait accompli and a tough rebuttal, for all the West’s economic and, indeed, military might, it lacked one crucial strategic asset: will. That, he seems to have concluded, was Russia’s strategic advantage.
