title: 6 Putin’s Priorities
---



On 7 May 2000, a rather grey, slightly stooped man passed between two files of Honour Guards of the Presidential Regiment, his dark suit contrasting sharply with the bright blue tunics and red facings of their ceremonial uniforms. This was the inauguration of newly elected President Vladimir Putin, a man who had been virtually unknown to most Russians a couple of years before, yet who had been elected in a convincing first-round victory with 53.4% of the vote, leagues ahead of his nearest rival, the Communist Party’s Gennady Zyuganov, with 29.5%.1

His speech seemed to offer something for everybody. He celebrated that, for the first time in Russia’s history, there had been a peaceful change in leadership through the ballot box (which would prove ironic in light of his future efforts to cling to power). He promised to protect and extend democracy (also ironic). Yet at the same time, he warned his listeners that:

We must not forget anything, we need to know our history, know it for what it is, draw lessons from it, and always remember those who created the Russian state, defending its dignity, made it a great, powerful, mighty state.2

At the time, this may have sounded like so much political rhetoric, even if 22 years later, the full meaning of these lines would be visited on a Ukraine that he felt challenged Russia’s ‘dignity’. After all, no one seemed to know who Putin really was, and everyone wanted to claim him. Liberal politicians in his home city of St Petersburg declared with satisfaction that ‘their man’ had ascended to the highest position in the land. Others pointed to his past career in the KGB and suggested that this was a statist first, a democrat second. It would turn out that the latter were right.

## Who is Vladimir Putin?

By the later 1990s, Boris Yeltsin’s incapacity to rule was becoming increasingly obvious. When he had an enemy, he could be focused and effective, but it was clear he had little real vision for Russia. He had risen to power as the candidate of the opposition: to the Communist Party, to Gorbachev, to the Soviet state. Quite what he was for never really became clear – except that all too often he was for ample supplies of alcohol, sometimes washing down prescription medications. In 1994, during a state visit to Washington DC, he had memorably been discovered by Secret Service agents drunk and in his underwear on Pennsylvania Avenue, looking for pizza. Visiting Stockholm in 1997, with a pronounced slur, he suddenly announced that Swedish meatballs reminded him of the face of tennis star Björn Borg. He also suffered numerous heart attacks – he had an emergency quintuple heart bypass in November 1996 – so perhaps it was unsurprising that his closest allies and backers – known as ‘the Family’ – had by then begun looking for a safe and loyal successor.

They found him in Vladimir Putin, a man who, until his elevation to the presidency, had seemed to be everybody’s loyal aide. It is well known that he had from a young age wanted to join the KGB, the Soviet intelligence and security agency. Notoriously, even as a child he had visited the KGB’s headquarters in St Petersburg – then still known as Leningrad – for all that the so-called Bolshoi Dom, the ‘Big House’, had an infamous reputation from the days of the old Stalin-era secret police in the 1930s. There, he asked a bemused officer how to join and was told to run along and come back when he had graduated from university. This he duly did, joining in 1975.

He was a scrappy kid from a poor family, whose childhood had been lived in the ruins of post-war Leningrad, a city which was hammered and starved by the Nazis during its 872-day siege in 1941–44. There is no evidence he joined the KGB to be ‘sword and shield of the Communist Party’, as it described itself, but rather because it offered a chance to rise in the system and emulate the heroes of Soviet spy films and TV series. He was enthusiastic, to be sure, but never a high-flier. He began his career in the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, counter-intelligence, and although his fluent German allowed him to transfer to the elite foreign espionage service, the First Chief Directorate, he was not destined for a career as a case officer working undercover in some embassy around the world. Instead, he was posted to Dresden, where he was essentially a liaison officer with the Stasi, East Germany’s counterpart to the KGB. Claims that he was involved in nefarious covert operations, such as running terrorists in the West, appear wholly unfounded. Instead, his days were largely spent filing reports to Moscow, routing documents to his Stasi contacts, and generally handling the day-to-day bureaucracy of secret police work.

The closest thing he saw to action was the admittedly tense moment when, as the East German regime collapsed in 1989, he had to face down a crowd of protesters who would otherwise have mobbed the KGB’s offices, while indoors his colleagues were desperately trying to contact the local Soviet garrison. Nonetheless, the KGB officers in Germany were forced to return home, and he soon left KGB service, although it is unclear whether he was kept on their books as a reservist. In a country in collapse, he scrabbled around for work, first getting a job at Leningrad State University – probably thanks to his KGB connections – and then as an adviser to newly elected city mayor Anatoly Sobchak.

This is when he discovered his talent as fixer. He became Sobchak’s head of international affairs and then deputy. He wheeled and dealed, reaching accommodations with everyone from foreign companies to the mafia. He prospered, but he also made sure he had Sobchak’s back: when the major failed to win re-election in 1996, Putin moved on to Moscow, but when investigators started looking into Sobchak’s financial affairs in 1997, it was Putin who arranged for him to fly to France ahead of any arrest warrants. In Moscow, he became deputy to the head of the Presidential Property Management Department – one of the most infamously corrupt branches of the Presidential Administration – and then deputy head of the Presidential Administration. He was discreet, efficient, loyal and sober, all characteristics that endeared him to the Family.

Up to then, he had always been a figure modestly standing behind his patron of the moment, but in 1998, he would come out of the shadows, when Yeltsin appointed him director of the Federal Security Service (FSB: Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti). For the eager KGB middle-achiever, it was a career milestone, although he did not stay long at the offices in the Lubyanka building in central Moscow. After only a year, he was made one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers – and later that same day, Prime Minister. By this stage, it was clear that the Family had made its choice.

In the Russian system, the prime minister is more the administrator-in-chief than anything else: real executive power sits with the president. However, the constitution does give him one particular role: if the president is ever incapacitated or stands down, he becomes Acting President. On 31 December 1999, less than five months into Putin’s premiership, Yeltsin duly resigned. The first presidential decree the new acting president signed explicitly gave Yeltsin and his relatives immunity from any future corruption charges – Putin knew how to look after his patrons. Yeltsin’s resignation triggered early presidential elections, catching Putin’s rivals off guard. With effective incumbency, and the full power of the Kremlin machine behind him, Putin easily won the March poll. At last he was no one’s understudy or fixer, but the boss. Now he had power, what would he do with it?

## Putin in Charge

It quickly became clear that Putin intended to restore the power of the state at home and Russia abroad, by whatever means necessary. The billionaire oligarchs who had run much of the country behind the scenes under Yeltsin were brought to heel, not least when the richest of them all, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested and imprisoned when he seemed not to realize that the days when they could involve themselves with politics were over. Putin was not going to be anyone’s catspaw or instrument.

However, his immediate focus would be Chechnya, and this became something of a test case for the new order. In September 1999, explosions had rocked four apartment buildings in Moscow, Buynaksk in the North Caucasus region of Dagestan and Volgodonsk in the southern Rostov region. More than 300 civilians were killed and more than a thousand injured. Jihadists from Chechnya were immediately blamed. The public response was a predictable mix of fear and anger, and this helped confirm a national consensus that the country needed a strong, tough hand. There is continued controversy around these bombings, with good reasons to suspect they were actually organized by Putin’s backers within the security community – with or without his knowledge – but either way, a public which for a long time had shied away from the thought of any renewed war in Chechnya began to waver. After all, a month earlier the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, along with Saudi-born jihadist Samir Saleh Abdullah, known as Khattab, had launched a military incursion into Dagestan. It had been repelled in a month of sporadic fighting, but this seemed further evidence that Maskhadov either could not or would not control the extremists in Chechnya.

In October, as will be discussed in the next chapter, the Russians launched the Second Chechen War, and it was soon clear that they had been preparing for it. Compared with the shambolic and often half-hearted way the Kremlin had fought the first war, it had not only assembled a suitable and powerful military force, it also made sure it controlled the narrative at home. The invasion of Dagestan and the apartment bombings provided a powerful rationale for action, and the consequent invasion, launched while Putin was prime minister but fought during his presidency, set the tone for his rule. The Russian state was back: it would brook no challenges at home, or on its borders, and it would assert its security interests no matter what the outside world might think.

Putin was never anything less than a convinced Russian nationalist. Even before he was president, he had made it clear that, in his opinion, ‘Russia has been a great power for centuries, and remains so. It has always had and still has legitimate zones of interest ... We should not drop our guard in this respect, neither should we allow our opinion to be ignored.’3 However, at first he seemed genuinely to believe this could be achieved in some kind of partnership with the West – indeed, in 2000 he even seemed to think someday Russia could join NATO.4 Putin was the first world leader to call President George W. Bush after the 2001 9/11 terrorist attacks, and he seemed very willing to cooperate in the ‘Global War on Terror’. According to then-defence minister Sergei Ivanov, as US and NATO forces were invading Afghanistan later that year, officials from the Islamist Taliban movement actually approached Russian border guards on the Tajik–Afghan border. They had a message for Moscow, which they were offering an anti-American alliance. As Ivanov put it, ‘we rejected it with the world famous English-speaking gesture: “F... off.”’5

The trouble is that from the first, there was a clear disconnect between how Putin and the West saw the relationship. He saw Russia’s Chechen war as its own front in that global struggle, and was outraged when human rights abuses on the ground were criticized in the West. Meanwhile, he believed that Russia had an absolute right to hegemony over the post-Soviet successor states and a promise – which the West denied – that NATO would not expand eastward. When, in 2004, seven nations were allowed into what he considered an anti-Russian club – including the three Baltic States, which had been part of not simply the Warsaw Pact, but actually the USSR – he was furious. By 2006, he was feeling that Russia had been exploited, conned and marginalized, and at a keynote speech in Munich, in February 2007, he suggested that the United States was trying to create a ‘unipolar’ world, one in which ‘there is one master, one sovereign’ through the ‘almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in international relations, force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflict.’ Concluding that ‘Russia is a country with a history that spans more than a thousand years and [which] has practically always used the privilege to carry out an independent foreign policy’, he made it clear that Moscow was once again considering itself a great power, and would assert that without worrying if it pleased the West.6

## Putin’s Ministers

Putin could not and did not do it all himself. Later chapters will detail the specific arms of service and the character and reforms associated with each of his defence ministers. Nonetheless, there is a clear trajectory that mirrors his own evolving perception of Russia’s needs and also the challenges associated with bringing change to a large, proud and often self-interested organization.

Anatoly Serdyukov

Head, Federal Tax Service

Sergei Shoigu

Minister for Emergency Situations, Governor of Moscow Region



He inherited Marshal Igor Sergeyev, the former Strategic Rocket Forces commander, who had tried to introduce some reorganization and modernization, much of which meant closing down various military educational establishments and joining together the Siberian and Trans-Baikal Military Districts in the interests of efficiency. Some divisions were formally assigned ‘constant readiness’ status, which was meant to mean that they were fully equipped and kept at not less than 80% of their establishment strength, but it is questionable how often this was really achieved.

It was a mark of Putin’s interest in rebuilding Russian military strength from the first that he soon replaced Sergeyev with one of his closest allies, Sergei Ivanov. A contemporary of Putin’s, he also came from Leningrad and joined the KGB, where the two men got to know each other. Whereas Putin’s KGB career was lacklustre, though, Ivanov was on the fast-track, joining the elite First Chief Directorate, its foreign espionage arm, and later transferring to the post-Soviet FSB. In the early years, there were limited extra resources available for the military, and those were to a large degree swallowed up by the Second Chechen War. Although essentially a victory, this was more because the Russians managed to avoid the mistakes of the first war rather than demonstrating any particularly greater capability.

This was to be Ivanov’s task, although from the first he was hindered by his limited military expertise and also the resistance of the generals. It was also a gargantuan task, after years of neglect and mismanagement. He did make some progress, to be sure, especially in pushing for a reduced dependence on conscripts. National service was reduced to 12 months. Many within the High Command resisted this: they felt Russia had to have a millions’ strong reserve pool of ex-draftees in case of a major war, and that 18 months, let alone 12, was not long enough for the men to be properly trained and deployable for longer than a few months. Regardless, Ivanov was committed to a slightly smaller army, but one made up of a greater proportion of kontraktniki volunteers serving on longer-term contracts, and Putin was won over both by the argument that such a military would be more effective, and also by the fact that this was politically popular in the country.

One of Ivanov’s biggest problems was that he was indispensable, though. He was one of Putin’s key advisers on security and foreign affairs, and in 2005 was also made Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the defence industries. The other was that he was neither a military man nor a money man. He was dependent on the advice from the generals – who often were simply arguing for more of everything – and although more and more money was being spent, without any clear blueprint for change and buy-in from the High Command, much was being wasted on contradictory or redundant boondoggles.

In 2007, Ivanov was promoted to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister. This time, Putin went for a money man, someone with a track record of institutional reform and no particular problems with alienating the High Command: Anatoly Serdyukov. His detractors – of whom there were many – called him the ‘furniture salesman’ because he had once worked for a homewares company, but his previous career had been heading and modernizing Russia’s dysfunctional tax service. Serdyukov would prove an unexpectedly successful reformer of the military because of three great strengths: his Chief of the General Staff, Nikolai Makarov; the 2008 Georgian War; and the fact that he really didn’t care what his generals thought of him. Gen. Makarov was a serious and well-respected officer, who had a good sense of what was needed. The underwhelming performance of the military in Georgia gave Serdyukov and Makarov grounds to force the conservative High Command to accept serious reforms. And Serdyukov’s willingness to court the generals’ disfavour – so long as he had Putin’s support, that was all he needed – allowed him, an outsider with no ties to military traditions or arm of service loyalties, and everything to prove, to embark on a systematic and brutal series of reforms.

In October 2008, he unveiled a plan for what he described as the most radical changes since the end of the Second World War, intended to create modern, flexible forces ready at any time for anything from a full-scale war to out-of-area interventions. The total establishment strength of the military was to be reduced by 200,000 in the next four years, with a further increase in the proportion of professionals. The Ground Forces would move from being built around the division to the smaller and more flexible brigade, all – not just the precious 20% – in permanent readiness. These brigades would also go through a sustained modernization, such that by 2020, 70% of all their weapons systems would be of the latest generation.

Meanwhile, he trained his sights on the officer corps, which Serdyukov said was ‘reminiscent of an egg which is swollen in the middle. There are more colonels and lieutenant-colonels than there are junior officers.’7 Some 205,000 officers’ positions were cut, and the higher ranks were pruned especially dramatically, with 200 generals dismissed. At the other end of the scale, new programmes were launched to recruit, train and retain professional NCOs, whose lack had been a serious and traditional weakness of the Russian military.

No wonder Serdyukov was so roundly despised within the so-called ‘Arbat Military District’ – the senior officers working within the Defence Ministry and General Staff buildings near that famous Moscow street – but it was actually a sex scandal with political overtones that led to his downfall. By that stage, the reform programme was underway, but the anger and resentment of the generals obvious. Putin needed someone who not only knew how to knit communities back together, but also had a track record of successful institutional reform, and the best candidate was Sergei Shoigu. Russian politics are notoriously vicious and factional, but despite being one of the longest-serving figures on the national stage – pre-dating Putin – Shoigu has the singular distinction of rising far without seeming to make blood enemies. In the 1990s, he took a series of corrupt and inefficient services and brought them together as the Ministry for Emergency Situations (MChS: Ministerstvo po Chrezvychainym Situatsiyam), which emerged as one of the country’s more efficient and better-run agencies. He had just taken up the position as Governor of the Moscow Region when Putin suddenly needed a new defence minister, but took on the new job without complaint.

Shoigu will not be minister for ever. There has been talk of his becoming Governor of Siberia, Prime Minister, even President some day, if the position ever falls vacant, although the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the poor performance of Russia’s troops mean that his reputation is now getting distinctly tarnished. However, he and his hard-nosed Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov had presided over the creation of an instrument which granted Putin considerable authority at home and abroad, at least until truly put to the test. These have been years of war, in Chechnya, in Crimea and the Donbas, in Syria, and then in all of Ukraine. Some of these wars proved invaluable learning opportunities for the military as a whole, but the 2022 invasion of Ukraine also demonstrated that there was much still to reform, and also that Putin himself may have become over-confident precisely as a result of the military’s apparent progress.
