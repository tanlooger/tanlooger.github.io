title: 23 Power Projection：Blue and Black Berets
---



It certainly used to be the case that 2 August was the day a lot of Russian police got to pocket a lot of overtime. It probably still is. That day is Dyen Vozdushno-Desantnykh Voisk, or Day of the Airborne Troops, and whether you’re in Palace Square in St Petersburg, Gorky Park in Moscow or squares and war memorials all across Russia (and in many post-Soviet states, for that matter), you’ll see knots and clusters of serving and above all former paratroopers, in their sky-blue berets and blue-and-white striped telnyashka vests, chatting, singing, splashing about in public fountains, reminiscing and, of course, drinking. A chance to honour the brave, mourn the fallen and race around town in cars mounting blue and green flags and sometimes even fake turrets.

It can be a pretty rumbunctious affair, ending up in brawls with the OMON riot police, but it has become rather more sedate in recent years, not least as the state has come to recognize and thus co-opt it. You’ll as likely now see wives and girlfriends there, often also in matching telnyashki; you can even buy suitably striped romper suits for babies and matching coats for dogs. Watermelons have, for some unfathomable reason, become something of a fixture, often handed out for free by local authorities. Nothing helps make boisterously tipsy, muscle-bound ex-paras look less intimidating than seeing them all cradle oversized fruit.

Russia has days for all kinds of professions and arms of military service and these are meaningful things, not just marketing gimmicks dreamed up to sell banal greetings cards. Even so, one does not see train drivers (1 August) sporting in public fountains, social workers (8 June) picking fights with riot police, or tax inspectors (21 November) expecting free fruit. Indeed, there are special days for every element of the military, from submariners (19 March) to radio-electrical warfare operators (15 April ). But Paratroopers’ Day is distinctive, not just as an expression of Russia’s cult of hypermasculinity, something only deepened by Putin’s bare-chested politics of sovereignty and nationalism, nor simply because of paras’ macho clannishness and esprit de corps, but also increasingly through a sense that they – and the other power projection forces able to operate sometimes far beyond the country’s borders – are the real expression of great power status.1

When Putin came to power, after all, the priority was holding on to what Russia had and defending the Motherland, whether from Chechen insurgents or some threat beyond the border. Although nuclear weapons were the ultimate guarantor, they are too crude, too dangerous an instrument for anything but the most existential threat, and so reforming the conventional military was crucial. Increasingly, though, Putin became more ambitious: it was not simply a matter of holding the borders but being able to assert and defend Russia’s interests beyond them. From the 2008 Georgian War and anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa beginning that same year, to the seizure of Crimea and intervention into the Donbas in 2014, the Syrian deployment of 2015 and the 2022 Ukrainian invasion, Moscow has steadily been more willing to project its power abroad.

To establish Russia’s status as both a global power and also the regional hegemon and security guarantor in most of post-Soviet Eurasia, it maintains substantial intervention forces: the Air Assault Troops (VDV: Vozdushno-Desantniye Voiska), the Naval Infantry (MP: Morskaya Pyekhota), and the Spetsnaz special forces (as well as a growing establishment of shadowy and ambiguous semi-private semi-state Private Military Companies). As the best-equipped and most professional units within the military, mainly staffed by volunteer soldiers, they represent the cutting edge of Russia’s military. Once, they were often pressed into service – and grotesquely misused – as light infantry in Chechnya and elsewhere, simply because their training and fighting spirit made them the only units which could be relied upon. Now that the rest of the Ground Forces are increasingly competent, they can be used for the missions for which they are intended: power projection, rapid response and behind-the-lines mayhem.

‘Nobody but us!’

Nikto kromye nas, ‘nobody but us’, is the slogan of the VDV, and a fittingly bombastic one for a service which can claim to be one of the very first of its kind. The Soviets were pioneers of parachute warfare. Whereas Germany’s Fallschirmjäger were only founded in 1936 and the British Parachute Regiment in 1940, the Soviets staged their first experimental jumps in 1930, established a company-strength Aviation Motorized Landing Detachment the following year, and by 1932 had a full airborne brigade. Their operations may have been relatively crude – at first they had to climb out onto a plane’s wings to jump – but they fitted well into the aggressive style of ‘deep warfare’ pioneered by military thinkers such as Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. The idea was that airborne units would strike far beyond the enemy’s front line, to cut their supply lines, attack their headquarters, and spread chaos and dismay.

This mission continued into the post-war era, when the VDV became the Kremlin’s political enforcers abroad. They led the way in Operation Whirlwind, the suppression of the anti-Soviet 1956 revolution in Hungary and Operation Danube, the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 to end the liberal Prague Spring. They played a crucial role not just in the initial invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, but in the whole ten-year war. Of the 65 Soviet servicemen made Heroes of the Soviet Union for their conduct in Afghanistan, over one-third came from the VDV.

In the 1990s, although Defence Minister Grachyov was one of their own, they again were forced to shoulder a disproportionate burden in the First Chechen War and deployments into the Balkans. They also suffered cuts, even though ex-paratrooper and briefly Security Council secretary Alexander Lebed almost came to the point of mutiny as a result. During Gen. Igor Rodionov’s brief tenure as defence minister, when he was trying to rationalize the services and was proposing a reorganization that would in effect subordinate the paratroopers to the Ground Forces, Lebed furiously rolled up to the VDV Main Staff headquarters and denounced the plans as ‘tantamount to criminal’ and vowed to block them. The VDV officers present stood up and chanted ‘Glory to the army! Glory to Russia!’ and for a while there was a serious fear Lebed might actually try to use his standing with the military as the basis for a coup.2 As it was, he was quickly outmanoeuvred and soon thereafter dismissed, but it was a stark reminder of the paratroopers’ prickly esprit de corps. In any case, Rodionov didn’t last long either, and while the paratroopers suffered some reductions, they remained effectively autonomous.

They have prospered under Putin, despite successive reorganizations that have seen divisions such as the 104th Guards Airborne Assault Division downscaled to brigades and then re-formed again, back to divisional strength. There has, after all, been a deep ambiguity to the role of the so-called ‘winged infantry’ as an arm of service in its own right. Historically, VDV divisions were envisaged as strategic forces at the disposal of the General Staff, while regiment- or brigade-strength air assault units were operational forces supporting Military District commands. However, this was really geared for mass, conventional war. Besides, not only is the notion of the mass paratrooper drop controversial, the Military Transport Aviation (VTA: Voyenno-Transportnaya Aviatsiya) lacks the capacity to deliver more than – at best – two regiments of paratroopers at once. It would take the entire VTA fleet two and a half full sorties to lift a whole division. Meanwhile, the need to keep them capable of parachute or at least helicopter insertion means they need a whole suite of specialized equipment, from the BMD family of air-droppable light armoured fighting vehicles to their own, lighter version of the standard body armour.

In 2009–10, Defence Minister Serdyukov and Chief of the General Staff Makarov were reportedly contemplating abolishing the VDV as a separate combat arm altogether and transferring all their existing assets to the army. They were saved not just because Serdyukov and Makarov had other, more pressing priorities, but also because this was a time when the Kremlin was looking to a newly assertive foreign policy, for which it needed a national power projection reserve for intervention in regional or distant conflicts. This has proven prophetic: they were at the forefront of the seizure of Crimea in 2014, played a role in the Donbas conflict that followed, and in 2021 provided the lion’s share of the international peacekeeping force deployed into Kazakhstan, which was itself led by the VDV commander-in-chief, Col. Gen. Serdyukov. The expectation is that they will continue to be busy.

Serdyukov – no relation to the former defence minister – has proven not just a tough and demanding field commander, but a capable advocate of the VDV’s interests and its future role. As one former subordinate put it, ‘he sweats blue’ – in reference to the paratroopers’ distinctive blue berets and badges. He was a paratrooper from the first, enlisted as an officer cadet and graduated from the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1983. He was quickly put in charge of a reconnaissance platoon, suggesting that his instructors thought he had particular initiative and determination. They were right. He rose steadily through the ranks, and distinguished himself during the First Chechen War, and in 1999, in the composite VDV battalion assigned to the multi-national peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia that made the ‘Pristina Dash’ to seize Kosovo’s airport ahead of NATO troops. In 2002, Serdyukov briefly side-stepped into the Ground Forces, commanding a brigade in the Second Chechen War, before taking command of the 106th Guards Airborne Division in 2004. He then had higher command positions in the 5th Combined Arms Army and then as chief of staff of the whole Southern VO, playing a significant role in the annexation of Crimea, and then reportedly commanding Russian forces in the Donbas under the codename ‘Sedov’.

In 2016, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the VDV. In 2017, though, Serdyukov was involved in a traffic accident that left him with severe head injuries and a fracture of the spine. With characteristic determination, he returned to active duties and although his planned stint as commander of the Russian contingent in Syria was delayed, he went on to serve a six-month tour there in 2019, for which he was made a Hero of the Russian Federation. As a participant in every major declared and undeclared Russian military operation since 1991, he has not only a wealth of practical experience but also great authority within the VDV and the officer corps as a whole.

By parachute, plane or track

So the VDV was saved and is actually being revamped and, according to plans, expanded. It remains a strategic asset, and although one brigade is attached to each Military District, in practice command is usually exerted through the VDV headquarters in Moscow. They also work closely with military intelligence; this has been especially evident since 2014 in the Donbas, where elements of all the divisions have been identified as present by Ukrainian government sources. It is being used as the basis for new airmobile forces, but it is certainly not abandoning the parachute. Indeed, the Russians remain unusual in their commitment to large-scale drops. In the Vostok-2018 exercises in the Russian Far East, for example, a whole battalion with 50 vehicles was dropped by day from some 25 Il-76MD heavy transport aircraft, while the more recent Zapad-2021 exercise in western Russian and Belarus saw the first battalion-strength night drop in post-Soviet times. Around 600 soldiers and 30 BMD-2K-AU and BMD-4M airborne IFVs from the 76th Division’s 234th Regiment were dropped in the rear of the simulated enemy, moving out to seize an airfield to allow heavier reinforcements to be flown in more conventionally.

Unsupported paratrooper forces – even mechanized ones – are relatively fragile when deployed without such prompt support, though, and such operations are likely to be rare in today’s SAM-dense battlefield. Instead, the VDV is increasingly being configured as a multi-platform intervention force, capable of insertion by helicopter, by aircraft, or on the ground, and able to conduct strategic missions ranging from special operations – significantly, since 1992 they have had their own commando unit, the 45th Guards Independent Reconnaissance Brigade (a regiment since 2015) – through to major offensives. In essence, the notion is that the VDV will be able to generate power projection forces for interventions without having to rely on support from the Ground Forces. As one paratrooper officer told me in 2019, ‘the VDV is going to be Russia’s equivalent to the US Marine Corps – a separate little army, ready to be deployed wherever it is needed.’ To be sure, this was a loose parallel and delivered with more than a little bravado: even though the VDV is meant to be expanding to a planned 60,000, there is no way it will rival the 180,000-strong USMC, let alone acquire the same air and sea capabilities.

However, it does speak to Putin’s broad ambitions. The VDV is amongst the first in line for new kit, from the AK-12 rifle to the BMD-4M. They are acquiring new high-mobility vehicles, from Sarmat-2 buggies and AM-1 quadbikes to the heavier 4x4 Typhoon-VDV personnel carrier.3 Indeed, little speaks more to the importance Moscow places on the VDV than the range of specialist vehicles designed for them, including the BMD-4M Sadovnitsa (‘Gardener’). This is a personnel carrier that bristles with enough weapons also to be considered a pocket tank, even though it is too lightly armoured to fare well against the real thing. Like the VDV itself, it is light, fast, hard-hitting, and can be air-dropped by parachute, even with its crew inside (which is reportedly either terrifying or exhilarating, to taste) – yet is also very vulnerable if it gets caught in regular combat. Considering that the VDV is meant in the future not just to take ground but also hold it, it is also reacquiring proper tanks: T-72B3s. These will not be dropped by air, but instead deployed overland or flown to airfields to support VDV deployments.

Meanwhile, airmobile units which will be moved by helicopter are to be formed in all VDV brigades and divisions, as it acquires its own dedicated aviation brigade of four helicopter squadrons, rather than having to depend on external assets. This will field 12 massive Mi-26T2 heavy lifters, 24 Mi-8AMTSh assault transports and 12 Mi-35M day/night gunships.

In 2016, the VDV comprised 45,000 paratroopers in four divisions, four brigades and one special forces brigade. The plan is that by 2025, there will be 60,000 of them, in five divisions, two brigades and one special forces brigade. The new division, presumably the 104th Guards Air Assault Division, would be formed on the basis of the 31st Independent Guards Air Assault Brigade at Ulyanovsk, thus reviving a formation dissolved in the 1990s. Of course, all these plans will depend on the resources, not just money to buy the equipment, but also men (and women – the VDV is increasingly recruiting them, albeit not for front-line combat missions) to fill these new posts. The paratroopers are currently 70% kontraktnik, and Gen. Serdyukov has expressed a desire to bring this to 80%, if not higher. However, there is a lack of suitably fit and willing volunteers, and so long as he is determined also to maintain standards amongst his blue berets, it is unclear if he can hit these targets in the foreseeable future, at a time when all the other arms of service are also competing for professionals.

The Black Berets

Back at the end of the 1980s, I remember meeting a so-called morpekh, a contraction of Morskaya Pyekhota (MP), or Naval Infantry. He had served in Afghanistan: so desperate had the Soviet High Command been to send soldiers who were better motivated, trained and conditioned than the average conscript, that they raided the MP of every fleet for people to send to this landlocked country. He had hair-raising tales of the time his unit was sent to man an ‘eagle’s nest’ – a mountaintop observation post – that was hit by rebel mortars or snipers every day for a month, or of the stress of convoy escort work along the Salang Highway, never knowing if there was an ambush or a mine round the next corner. Nonetheless, he was still upbeat about his time in service, and had a wide range of comrades-in-arms around the country with whom he still kept in touch. ‘All sorts: other marines, army, a bunch of engineers, some border guards, even a couple of helicopter pilots.’ ‘Paratroopers?’ I incautiously asked. His face darkened at the thought that he might be friends with ‘those fucking chestolyubtsy’ – ‘glory hounds’ is probably the best translation. His main beef seemed to be that while the paras were expected to fight hard, they were also treated specially, while the MP were treated just like any other soldiers.

‘Black Devils’

After all, Russia does have another main intervention force: the ‘black beret’ marines of the Naval Infantry. They date back to the 18th century, but as important as their past glories are their 20th-century exploits. Many sailors were enthusiastic supporters of the Bolsheviks in the 1917 Revolution, and during the Civil War that followed, the 1st Naval Expeditionary Rifle Division played a part in many of the victories of the Red Guard (later, Red Army), especially against the ‘Whites’ under Gen. Pyotr Wrangel in Ukraine. After the end of the Civil War, most marine units were disbanded. In July 1939, though, the 1st Independent Special Rifle Brigade was formed within the Baltic Fleet, later becoming the 1st Special Marine Brigade. Additional units were formed during the Great Patriotic War, as sailors were turned into infantry in the desperate struggle to hold back the Axis advance: in all, ten divisions and brigades, ten regiments and 34 battalions with a total strength of more than 120,000 were raised, many from fleet reservists who had no ships to go to. Many proved tenacious fighters, earning themselves the nickname the ‘Black Devils’ from their German counterparts.

After the end of the war, the marines were again disbanded – the Red Navy was not an immediate priority and it was essentially a coastal defence force at that stage. However, as Soviet capacities grew, and ambitions with them, their value became again appreciated. In 1963, a first Naval Infantry regiment was stood up, again in the Baltic Fleet, with more to follow. Like the VDV, the MP had largely been used simply as infantry in the Second World War, but they had also pioneered special operations, and as the post-war Soviet navy began to operate further afield they acquired new roles. However, the Soviet Union – like Russia today – was never an especially convincing ‘blue water’ maritime power, and the MP lacked the same opportunities as the VDV to refine their tradecraft and make their name during the Cold War.

They remain somewhat in the shadow of the paratroopers, who are at once more numerous, more prestigious and more readily deployed in the kind of interventions with which Russia is now asserting itself. (And whose distinctive blue-striped telnyashka vest, marines will still grumble, was copied from their own black-striped one.) It may be unfair to suggest that the MP as a whole have something of a chip on their collective shoulder about the prestige of the VDV, but at least the Crimean operation and then the Syrian intervention both served to demonstrate their capacities. Their previous commander-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Alexander Kolpachenko, a former paratrooper and Afghan War veteran himself, fought to have them gain the same level of recognition. His successor, Lt. Gen. Viktor Astapov, another transfer from the VDV, has reaped the benefits. In 2021, the MP acquired a new flag and emblem, with a flaming gold grenade and fouled anchor on a black and red cross on a white field.

While this may sound trivial, it reflects a growing status for the MP which, while still part of the Coastal Troops and coming, in turn, under the Naval Main Staff, are closer to being treated as an arm of service in their own right. More to the point, with the new flag also came new money, as part of a further re-equipment that includes replacement tanks and APCs and new-generation landing ships. The only MP division that survived into the 2000s, only to be downsized into a brigade in 2009 – the Pacific Fleet’s 55th Division – isn’t coming back any time soon, but the effective strength of the brigades is certainly growing. Just as the VDV are expanding, so too may the MP, sooner than later.

‘Where we are, there is victory!’

Tam gdye my, tam – pobeda!, ‘Where we are, there is victory!’ goes their slogan, and since the collapse of the USSR, they have been far more active than at any time since the Great Patriotic War. They served in Chechnya, in both wars, and seized the southern Abkhaz port of Ochamchire in 2008. They served in anti-pirate patrols off Somalia from 2008, although not without controversy. Russia’s reputation for what could at best be described as a no-nonsense approach to policing was given something of a boost by the conduct of its navy and MP when, in May 2010, the destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov responded when Somali pirates boarded the MV Moscow University, a Liberian-flagged Russian tanker, forcing the crew to barricade themselves below decks. Supported by an armed Ka-27 helicopter, which returned fire when shot at by the pirates, killing one, a marine boarding party in small boats intercepted the tanker, overpowered the pirates and freed the crew. The marines then disarmed the surviving ten pirates and set them adrift some 300 nautical miles (560 kilometres) off the coast, in an inflatable boat with provisions but no navigation equipment. Although their fate is still unknown, it is generally assumed that they perished at sea.

Since then, the MP took the lead in the seizure of Crimea in 2014 and played a part in the subsequent operations in Donbas, including the 2022 invasion. They were also deployed to Syria in 2015 in support of Russia’s air campaign to prevent the collapse of the Assad regime. Indeed, one of Russia’s relatively few acknowledged casualties is a marine who died during the operation to rescue the two flight crewmen of the Su-24 shot down by Turkish fighters in 2015.

In total, there are just under 13,000 marines. Reflecting their status, they wear army-style combat dress, but black naval parade uniforms, and privates are called matros, ‘seaman’. However, the organization of the bulk of the MP is along Ground Forces lines. Each fleet has at least one brigade, which varies in size, but will typically have two to four infantry battalions, a tank battalion and a reconnaissance battalion, a sniper company, and support elements, now including a drone company. Many also have a dedicated air-assault battalion trained for parachute insertion.

Underwater Sentinels

The MP, being part of the wider Coastal Forces of the Navy, also include highly specialized anti-saboteur teams with the rather indigestible name Independent Special Designation Detachments to Combat Submarine Subversive Forces and Means (OSpN PDSS: Otryad Spetsialnovo Naznacheniya Borby s Podvodnymi Diversionnymi Silami i Sredstvami). These are the counterparts to the Naval Spetsnaz combat divers discussed in the following chapter, troops trained rather to defeat enemy efforts to sabotage vessels and coastal installations. They are largely recruited from within existing Naval Infantry, selected on the basis of their hardiness, diving and swimming skills and emotional stability.

There are 12 OSpN PDSS companies, which vary greatly in size, depending on the perceived local threat. The Black Sea Fleet, for example, clearly fears Ukrainian (or Western) sabotage at its Sevastopol base, so its 102nd OSpN PDSS is the largest of all, with two platoons of combat swimmers, a platoon of divers (also trained in explosive ordnance disposal) and a radio-electronic platoon (responsible for detecting and jamming enemy communications and detonation signals), for a total strength of 120 men. Others can be as small as just 30 men. They are armed with both conventional small arms and Russia’s distinctive array of underwater weapons including the SPP-1 four-barrel flechette pistol and the DP-64 Nepryadva ‘anti-sabotage grenade launcher’, a double-barrelled weapon that typically is loaded with one pyrotechnic round to show an enemy’s location – it floats to the surface and burns with a bright red flare – and one high-explosive round for a rather more forceful response. Just as it is said that a liar more often assumes he is being lied to, it says something that the Russians have such elaborate provisions to resist sabotage, of the sort that is a speciality for their Spetsnaz.
