title: 20 Armiya Rossii
---



Surreal though it may sound, near enough opposite the US embassy on Moscow’s Novinsky Boulevard, part of the busy Garden Ring road, is a shop selling high-end fashion – branded Armiya Rossii, or ‘Army of Russia’. Part of Voyentorg, the military’s official clothing and food supplier, it sells camouflage leggings and t-shirts emblazoned with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, nicely packaged versions of standard field rations, and even denim jackets with ‘Team Putin’ patches, and all at quite a price. This is part of Shoigu’s attempt to rebrand the military and a soldierly career as something chic and desirable, but is also striking that it is called ‘Army of Russia’, not ‘Russian Military’ or the like. For all the dependence on nuclear deterrence or the new capabilities of the Aerospace Forces, Russia has always been essentially a land power, and the Ground Forces remain the undisputed heart of its military. The Royal Navy may be the ‘Senior Service’ in the United Kingdom, because it pre-dates any real standing army (which essentially began with Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century). However, Russia’s standing army dates back to Ivan the Terrible’s Streltsy (Musketeers) of the mid-16th century, more than a century before it acquired a navy in Peter the Great’s reforms of 1696.

Russia’s Ground Forces (SV: Sukhoputnye Voiska) have their own banner, with crossed golden swords and flaming grenade on a red background, their own professional holiday (31 May, marking the formation of the Streltsy), their own patron saint (Alexander Nevsky, who famously defeated the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century), and their own motto: Vpered pekhota!, ‘Forward the Infantry!’ They are also the largest arm of service in the Russian military, numbering some 280,000 officers, men and (some) women as of the start of 2022.

Formally, they are all subordinated to the SV Main Command, but this is essentially an administrative element of the Defence Ministry, responsible for training, tactics and organizational management, with real operational command running from the General Staff through Military Districts (or Joint Strategic Commands in time of war). Indeed, in 1997, the SV Main Command was actually abolished and replaced with the Defence Ministry’s Main Directorate of Ground Forces, Directorate of Missile Forces and Artillery, Directorate of Military Air Defence and Directorate of Army Aviation. This proved an unhelpful reform, blurring the lines between the role of the ministry and the military command structures, and so in 2001, Putin decreed the recreation of the SV Main Command. As of writing, the Ground Forces commander-in-chief is Gen. Oleg Salyukov, a career tank officer, but at 66 he is nearing the age at which he would be expected to surrender the position to a successor.

The Battalion Tactical Group

Although, as will be discussed further below, the division is making a limited come-back, in the main the army is still primarily structured around the smaller brigade, one of the key innovations of the ‘New Look’ brought in by Serdyukov and Makarov. The brigade, though, is still a relatively large formation and most will typically be staffed with a mix of kontraktniki and conscripts, the latter of whom cannot by law be required to serve outside Russia’s borders except in time of war. As a result, even before the Donbas conflict made the need for such units necessary, the Ground Forces had begun to establish the means to create composite Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs), modular forces typically drawn from all-volunteer elements in existing brigades. At first, in the Donbas, these often had to be based on soldiers from more than one parent brigade, posing some interoperability challenges as soldiers not used to fighting together adjusted to their new structures. The need to rotate them through the Donbas to replenish casualties, resupply, and allow soldiers necessary rest and recreation, did at first also mean that maintaining the supply of such units was something of a headache for the personnel and logistical planners, pulling in troops from all across Russia. However, it did mean that the Russians could deploy meaningfully sized field forces drawn wholly from professionals. Soon it became possible for almost every brigade to be able to generate its own BTGs, and as already noted, the BTG will generally take a lion’s share of its support elements. This becomes a powerful way of quickly generating deployable forces drawn from kontraktniki in a peacetime army but, as became clear with the invasion of Ukraine, it means only one or two battalions from each brigade can actually be fielded – and that only by cannibalizing the rest of the force.

The details of BTGs vary, their structure reflecting both operational needs and available personnel, but in general they are mechanized battalions of up to 900 officers and men, with two to four tank or mechanized companies and attached artillery, reconnaissance, engineer, electronic warfare and rear support platoons. For example, a BTG generated by the 58th Army’s 19th Motor Rifle Brigade from Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia included a mechanized company in BMP-3 infantry combat vehicles, another in BTR-82As, a tank company with T-90s, a battery of Msta-S SPGs (Self-Propelled Guns), a battery of Tornado-G MLRS (Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems), a drone company and an oversized sniper platoon from another brigade. This is lighter than many other BTGs, but reflects the upland terrain in which it operates. BTGs’ actual structure and level of manning thus vary wildly: in the invasion of Ukraine, some only had 250 men. The result is a fairly self-sufficient ground combat unit with disproportionate fire and rear support, in some ways a scaled-down version of the brigades which are the basic building block of the Russian army.



The Return of the Division

The shift to a brigade structure under Serdyukov was essentially predicated on the notion that the only wars Russia was really likely to have to fight were going to be smaller-scale wars of intervention abroad – essentially much like the thinking that shaped most NATO armies in the post-Cold War era. Under Shoigu, with the eruption of undeclared war in Ukraine and the worsening of relations with the West, the Russian military also began to contemplate the possibility of full-scale war against a peer or near-peer adversary on or close to its borders.

What that requires are not only heavy forces, but also higher-order structures that can incorporate battalions from other Military Districts and command and supply them in the field. The concern was that managing what might be dozens of new brigades and BTGs transferred from elsewhere in Russia would overwhelm an army or VO commander. Thus, at the same time that light, high-mobility forces were being created, so too did divisions make a partial come-back. When Shoigu started the process by restoring the elite and prestigious Taman and Kantemir Divisions, he was not only playing to the generals, but he was also marking the start of this process. As of the end of 2021, Russia had restored nine Ground Forces divisions: eight mechanized and one tank. In addition, in 2014 the 1st Guards Tank Army was reactivated. These larger formations are disproportionately based in the west of the country, especially around Ukraine, with none in the Central VO.

In part, this change of step reflects an evolution of military thinking and lessons from Russia’s operations in the Donbas. There, the army depended on assembling ad hoc battalion tactical groups from the all-volunteer elements of brigades across the country. This often created serious interoperability problems, as soldiers who had not trained together were thrown directly into battle. While they were generally able to win individual engagements against Ukrainian forces, due not least to greater firepower and a technological edge, they were often unable to exploit these victories effectively. These re-formed divisions will therefore be used not just as rapid response defensive elements but also as the core of combined-arms formations able to deliver shattering blows quickly, in a reprise of the Soviets’ own take on blitzkrieg.

It is not that Russia is abandoning the brigade. Rather, it is going to field a mix of brigades and divisions, with the former more oriented towards projecting power in ‘small wars’, divisions in larger ones. Furthermore, these divisions range in size, from the equivalent of the old Russian four-regiment structure down to smaller, two- or three-regiment ones that are in some ways more like bulked-out brigades, albeit with greater redundancy in their command capacity and support units. Most divisions will thus have anything from 6,000 to 7,000 personnel (compared with around 13,000 and 10,000 in the old Soviet motor rifle and tank divisions, respectively).

It is easier to announce the creation of a division and award it its own flag than actually bring it to full operational status, though. Back in November 2014, for example, it was announced that a motor rifle division was going to be re-established at Yelnya, east of Smolensk, to use the base of what was once the 144th Motor Rifle Division, a unit withdrawn from East Germany in the early 1990s and then disbanded in 1998. In July 2015, it was announced that it would be stood up within two years, on the basis of an existing brigade, which turned out to be the 28th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade from Yekaterinburg. In practice, while the 144th Motor Rifle Division was indeed operational by the end of 2017, instead of the original four manoeuvre regiments it was meant to have, three motor rifle and one tank, even as of 2020, it had just three, still being short a motor rifle regiment. Finding troops, reshuffling commands and relocating forces all takes time.

Heavy Metal

Arguably, two classes of equipment truly epitomize the Russian military: the tank and the artillery. Western and especially European armies have tended to run down their stocks of tanks, seeing little use for them in the kind of dusty counter-insurgency conflicts that they believed would be their usual challenge in the coming years. On the other hand, tanks remain crucial to Russia’s high-tempo and aggressive approach to warfighting. The T-72, designed in the 1960s and first fielded in 1970, remains a mainstay, progressive upgrades meaning that the 2,000 or so T-72B3 versions currently in use are still very creditable assets on the modern battlefield. The later T-80 has had a more chequered history, but like the T-90/T-90M – itself a modernized T-72 – will remain in service for the foreseeable future because of the delays and downsizing of the T-14 Armata project.

Historically, artillery has been Russia’s ‘god of war’, and while all armies rely primarily on long-range firepower – the role of the other manoeuvre forces is often to find and fix the enemy long enough for the artillery to break them – the Russians still field a lot of it. For example, while a typical Russian battalion tactical group will have two or three batteries with a mix of 122mm and 152mm self-propelled guns and rocket artillery, as well as several platoons of mortars, a standard US battalion has just a mortar platoon. This is not a wholly fair comparison – the BTG is a specialized force that takes up the lion’s share of the support elements of the brigade that generates it, and the US model is to concentrate artillery at higher levels of command, to support the regiments in the field. However, even looking at the brigade level, a full-strength Russian mechanized brigade will typically include two artillery battalions and a rocket battalion, to its US counterpart’s single artillery battalion.

This all gives some sense of the priority the Russians give to having lots of artillery in play, and explains why (beyond lobbying for better guns of his own) US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, while still Army Chief of Staff, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that when matched up against the Russians, ‘we don’t like it, we don’t want it, but yes, technically [we are] outranged, outgunned on the ground.’1 That point about being outranged is also important: the US’s standard M109 152mm self-propelled gun has a range of 21 kilometres, or 30 kilometres with a rocket-assisted shell. The Russians’ new 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV, already coming into service, has a reported – though unconfirmed – range of 40 kilometres, or 80 kilometres with a rocket-assisted round. Russia’s heavy multiple-launch rocket systems can also hit targets 90 kilometres away, and they also field the Iskander (SS-26) ballistic missile with a 500-kilometre range, which can be fitted with a range of conventional warheads, including cluster munitions, a thermobaric fuel-air explosive and even an electromagnetic pulse device that can burn out electrical systems in its blast radius. Range isn’t everything: everything from rate of fire and accuracy to reliability and survivability all count. Nonetheless, this is an area where the Russians have a clear strength.

Specialized forces for Specialized Operations

The adoption of the brigade structure also gave the SV Main Command greater scope for experimenting with specialized formations adapted to particular combat environments. The Chechen wars had led to a resurgence of units trained and equipped especially for mountain warfare, and there had long been a particular emphasis on cold-weather operations for units in the High North of the Arctic. However, this became much more formal and extensive as Putin began to consider the prospect of operations in new combat theatres.

The last Soviet specialized unit, the 68th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Mountain), was disbanded in 1991, and the absence of such forces was a clear problem during the Chechen wars. As a result, in 2004, Putin announced the creation of two special mountain brigades in the Northern Caucasus, made up of kontraktniki. The Defence Ministry originally promised that they would be operational in 2005, but it took until the end of 2007 for the 33rd and 344th Independent Motor Rifle Brigades to be ready, based in Botlikh in Dagestan (later, Maikop) and Zelenchukskaya in Karachaevo-Cherkessia, respectively. Each has a strength of around 2,000 troops, although questions continue to be raised about whether they truly have the skills and physical conditioning for the mission.

Beyond that, Russia has long relied on its ability to fight in cold-weather conditions as both a defensive and offensive asset, but as Moscow increasingly looks to the High North as a strategic theatre, it is forming and equipping forces to match. To a considerable extent this is the responsibility of the air forces and the navy. New military facilities are also established, such as the innovative Arkticheski Trilistnik (‘Arctic Trefoil’) on the island of Alexandra Land, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, Russia’s most northern base. As a result, there is a perceived need for ground forces able to operate in extreme polar environments. The 200th Brigade, headquartered at Pechenga, and the 80th Independent Brigade at Alakurtti are designated Arctic units, with specially modified equipment – and also a revival of low-tech solutions such as sleds pulled by either dogs or reindeer, especially useful for covert reconnaissance and raiding given their relative silence. Of course, it is not simply or even mainly a matter of kit. These forces train in the unforgiving High North environments increasingly frequently and realistically.

Back in the 1920s, the Soviet struggle against the Basmachi, the rebels of Central Asia, was often led by the Red Cavalry. Today, experiences in Syria have encouraged the Russians to experiment with light mechanized forces, a modern counterpart. In 2009, the 56th Independent Airborne Assault Brigade had tried mounting elements in UAZ-31512 ‘Hunter’ jeeps, but although they demonstrated the potential value of ‘super-light’ mechanized forces, the vehicles were just too small to be practical, unable to accommodate heavy weapons and adequate supplies, so they were first re-equipped with GAZ-66 trucks, then returned to conventional APCs. However, in 2016, the Russians supplied the Syrian Arab army with armed UAZ Patriot pickup trucks intended as highly mobile convoy escorts and also as a counter to the numerous armed ‘technicals’ – improvised armed trucks, often based on the ubiquitous Toyota Land Cruisers and Hiluxes – fielded by the various rebel groups. This sparked a wider interest in such vehicles, and in 2017 it was decided that one of the 30th Motor Rifle Brigade’s four battalions would be equipped with UAZ Patriots. The 30th Motor Rifle Brigade is based at Samara in central Russia, hardly desert territory, but a region of steppes, forests and mountains. Given that the UAZ Patriot can reach speeds of 150 kilometres per hour and is much more fuel efficient than heavier, armoured APCs, the idea appears to be to test the notion that such a force could provide highly mobile raid and reaction forces in a range of difficult environments, from deserts to woodland, where the larger BTR-80s of the rest of the brigade would have trouble or be forced to move more slowly.

Logistics

For all this, the old saw that ‘amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics’ is perfectly true, and historically the Russians have tended to put more effort into ‘teeth’ than ‘tail’. This should not be taken as an absolute, as they and their Soviet predecessors absolutely could and would put much effort into preparation. However, just as their tanks and ships were optimized for speed and firepower more than comfort and survivability, in the past especially, they gave less priority to looking after their soldiers and anticipated more breakdowns and equipment failures.

This was changing even in late Soviet times, as the High Command came to appreciate that modern war puts demands on soldiers that had to be addressed, and also that experienced combatants were too valuable to waste. The war in Afghanistan saw an unparalleled military-medical apparatus in place, from the Bissektrisa (‘Bisector’) Mi-8MB casevac air ambulance that would lift casualties off the battlefield, to the dedicated An-12 and Il-18 medical transport flights that would take serious cases back to the Soviet Union and the military hospital in Tashkent. In the 1990s, much of this practical experience was not so much lost as unable to be applied: one army doctor who had served in Afghanistan and then Chechnya described to me having to use converted fanbelts looted from a car repair shop as tourniquets in the latter conflict, simply because they had no official supplies. However, as soon as the money was available, the lessons learned were readdressed, especially as the new emphasis on higher-skilled soldiers and recruiting and retaining volunteers also demanded a more solicitous approach to the ranks.

More broadly, though, logistics is still an Achilles heel of the Russian forces, and it doesn’t help that Putin, with his relatively minimal military experience, still seems more impressed by ‘teeth’ than ‘tail’, creating no political pressure to address the latter. In the Donbas in 2014–22 – admittedly, where sometimes the need to retain a little implausible deniability did limit operations – high-intensity BTG operations would sometimes peter out after a few days simply because supplies, especially ammunition, were being consumed that much more quickly than they could be replenished. After all, one consequence of having brigades and BTGs with so much more artillery and air defence capability than their Western counterparts is that they also have greater supply needs – yet their ‘tails’ are not equally large. Certainly, once full-scale operations in Ukraine began in 2022, the logistical challenges of sustaining major combat operations became very clear.

Each army is meant to have its own material-technical support brigade, but not all do – or else it is largely there only on paper. Instead, major operations would still be very dependent on the railway network, hence why Russia’s military also has Railway Troops, ten specialized brigades tasked with building, repairing, securing and maintaining track and facilities (the actual rolling stock is the responsibility of RZhD and the country’s other train companies). Even so, Russia uses a wider gauge track than is the norm in Western Europe: it is only to be found in Finland, eastern Slovakia and short stretches in Poland and Hungary. This would have extremely serious implications in the case of any hypothetical Russian invasions outside the former USSR where it remains the norm. Supplies moving from 1,520mm ‘Russian Gauge’ to the more common 1,435mm ‘Stephenson Gauge’ would have to be cross-loaded to new wagons or else be on ones which can adjust their wheels. Locomotives cannot do this, though, so new engines would be needed either way. In any case, this would add extra time and complexity into the supply process – at a time when these narrow ribbons of steel would presumably be prime targets for artillery, air attacks and partisans. The Railway Troops may know their trade, but having constantly to repair the lines would slow things even further.

Away from railheads, and when the trains are not running, the Russians would have to rely on trucks, and here, even if they conscript vehicles and drivers from the commercial sector, it is doubtful that they have enough to sustain major operations. One credible estimate is that they simply could not sustain high-tempo operations more than 150 kilometres from their supply dumps, which in turn are difficult and time-consuming to establish deep into hostile territory. To give a specific example:

Although each army is different, there are usually 56 to 90 multiple launch rocket system launchers in an army. Replenishing each launcher takes up the entire bed of the truck. If the combined arms army fired a single volley, it would require 56 to 90 trucks just to replenish rocket ammunition. That is about a half of a dry cargo truck force in the material-technical support brigade just to replace one volley of rockets.2

What’s more, that is just the army’s rockets, not considering its six to nine artillery battalions, and all the mortars, tank guns, anti-air and anti-tank missiles, grenades and bullets it would expend; and all the fuel; and food and water. In other words, the Russian army probably could not launch and maintain full-scale combat operations far from its borders and its rail network.

Capabilities

How does all this translate into genuine capacity to project force outside Russia’s borders? A 2020 report from the US thinktank RAND posited a series of notional scenarios, from an escalation to conventional warfighting in Ukraine, all the way to a stability operation to protect the government in Venezuela, on the other side of the world.3 For each, they considered the stresses placed on the Russian military in assembling the forces, moving them to their theatre of operations, whether by land, sea or air, and then sustaining them. With the exception of the Ukrainian scenario – which the authors themselves considered an unpredictable outlier – only one would not trigger ‘excess stress’ on one or other of the variables. This one posited a rising Islamic State insurgency in neighbouring Tajikistan and the deployment, with the local government’s approval, of a battalion of Spetsnaz and six regular BTGs plus supporting elements. Even so, this would put moderate stress on Russia’s airlift capacity; as we will be discussing in the next chapter, this is a distinct limiting factor on any rapid or distant deployment.

All the other five scenarios, from sending a relief force to Syria to clashing with China over Kazakhstan, put excessive strain on some aspect of Russia’s rail, airlift or sealift capabilities, while the latter also exceeded the predicted capacity to raise the contingent (18 manoeuvre battalions, only one-tenth of total forces) in the timeframe needed. After all, even movements by rail within Russia and its immediate neighbourhood require huge logistical efforts. The transport of a single division demands between 1,950 and 2,600 wagons, for example, which could mean up to 50 whole trains.

The conclusion is that Russia’s Ground Forces are powerful in theatres close to their western and south-western military infrastructure – as the Georgians and Ukrainians know to their cost – but not in a position globally to project and above all maintain large forces, and even on its southern and eastern borders, it will often struggle to move fast. This is not to denigrate the Russian military. It has very real capabilities, especially when used as intended, and this provides Moscow with a whole suite of strategic options, from credible ‘heavy metal diplomacy’4 – coercive diplomacy – all the way through to kinetic operations, as will be discussed below.

Yet this is not the Red Army, and thoughts of it crashing through Western Europe to the Channel or even of a quick push along the Baltic coast, simply are not borne out by the technical details of force structure, logistics and lift. Indeed, the way the 2022 Ukrainian invasion quickly bogged down was evidence both of the challenges of logistics and of the catastrophic degree to which Putin and his commanders had failed properly to consider them. Assessments such as the RAND’s are essentially all based on structural and physical capacities – numbers of tanks, volume of fuel pipelines, range of transport aircraft. They cannot account for all the intangibles of training, morale, discipline and command. As will be discussed later – and as has been very evident in Ukraine – on these indices, progress had clearly been much less impressive than Shoigu’s PR machine had led everyone, even Putin, to believe.
