title: 21 The Sky is Russia’s!
---



It must have been hard for the airmen. As Russia took its nationalist turn, gung-ho action movies began to be churned out – some pretty good, some atrociously bad – showing heroic engineers or infantry, sailors or Spetsnaz. The Air Forces hadn’t really had their chance at a blockbuster. They played a minimal, supporting role in Crimea; they were conspicuously absent from the skies over the Donbas; and carpet-bombing Chechen cities, full of civilians who were Russian citizens, after all, somehow lacked glamour. Syria changed all that, and a big release for 2021 was Nebo (‘Sky’), loosely based on the shooting down of a Su-24M bomber by Turkish fighters in 2015. Of course, this time, it’s made clear who the good guys are, and both the aircrew of the downed plane are saved. It’s perhaps a little too Slavically soulful to be considered Russia’s answer to Top Gun, but it is slick and pyrotechnic and, thanks to the Defence Ministry’s active support (part of it was actually shot in Syria), uses genuine aircraft and locations to good effect. There’s even a Shoigu-alike, who growls that ‘we don’t abandon our people’.

After a decade of decline, followed by a decade in some ways in the shadows, the late Putin era and especially the Syrian intervention has provided the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS: Vozdushno-Kosmicheskiye Sily) with a chance to, well, spread their wings. Some 90% of all ground attack, bomber, interceptor and transport flight crews have now served at least one tour in Syria, and some flew 150–200 sorties there, equivalent to the total annual flying time for many Western counterparts.1Meanwhile, about three-quarters of the air fleet is considered to be modern or modernized.

## Always in Transition

Russia has had an air force since 1912; the Imperial Air Force played a role in the First World War, and was succeeded by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Air Fleet in 1918, later the Air Force of the Red Army. Much of what was by then the Military Air Forces (VVS: Voyenno-Vozdushniye Sily) was shattered on the first days of the German invasion in 1941, often destroyed on the ground thanks to Stalin’s wilful refusal to believe his own spies and generals about the imminence of war. Rebuilt at speed during that apocalyptic confrontation, it continued its regular re-invention, and through the Cold War years developed and expanded. By 1980, it was the largest such force in the world, with around 10,000 aircraft of all types, within three distinct elements: the strategic bombers of Long-Range Aviation (DA: Dalnaya Aviatsiya), the interceptors and ground attack aircraft of Frontal Aviation (FA: Frontovaya Aviatsiya), and Military Transport Aviation (VTA: Voyenno-Transportnaya Aviatsiya).

Beyond that, there was – and still is – also a separate Naval Aviation (AV-MF: Aviatsiya Voyenno-Morskovo Flota). Meanwhile, having been first a division of the artillery and then, in 1941, the Main Directorate of Air Defence of the Red Army, after the Great Patriotic War, in 1954, it became a full arm of service, the Air Defence Forces (PVO: Protivovozdushnoi Oborony), divided into the Anti-Aircraft Missile Forces, Fighter Aviation and Radio Engineering Troops.

When the Soviet Union was dissolved, Russia retained the same structure and the lion’s share of Soviet air assets: some 65% of personnel and 40% of aircraft. Nonetheless, air forces are especially vulnerable to periods of inaction and inattention: pilots who do not fly enough hours see their skills degrade; airframes not subject to regular maintenance become unflyable or unsafe; air fleets not modernized become quickly obsolescent. The 1990s were thus especially hard on the VVS and the PVO. By 1995, Frontal Aviation had shrunk from over 5,000 warplanes to fewer than half that, for example, of which two-thirds were already deemed close to obsolete. A similar pattern obtained across the other air forces.

In 1998, the PVO were rolled into the VVS, while certain aspects of the strategic defence of the Motherland fell to the new Space Forces, established in 2001. These, in turn, became the basis of the Aerospace Defence Forces (VVKO: Voiska Vozdushno-Kosmicheskoye Oborony), formed as a distinct arm of service in 2011. The game of musical chairs was not yet over, though, and in 2015 they merged with the VVS to form the new, all-inclusive Aerospace Forces, which includes everything from helicopter gunships to anti-ballistic missile systems.



## The Aerospace Forces

The VKS has now around 148,000 personnel, of whom around three-quarters are professionals. As of the start of 2021, the VKS operated some 1,709 fixed-wing combat aircraft and some 1,500 helicopters. These included 380 Su-27 and 267 MiG-29 fighters, 131 MiG-31 interceptors, and the first five new advanced MiG-35 fighter-bombers. There were also 274 Su-24 and 125 Su-34 bombers, and 193 Su-25 ground attack jets. Long-Range Aviation also fielded 16 Tu-160, 42 Tu-95, and 66 Tu-22M bombers. To these can be added 91 aircraft in Naval Aviation: 22 MiG-29s, 43 Su-27/33s, 22 Su-24s, and four Su-25s. There are also transport aircraft and reconnaissance and command platforms, including the 16 Beriev A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft of the 144th Airborne Early Warning Regiment, with their distinctive massive radar rotodome atop the fuselage. Then there are more than 650 helicopters in the operational air fleet, although this is out of a nominal total fleet of more than 850. The expectation is that the share that is fully operational will steadily rise, not least as Soviet legacy helicopters are formally scrapped or mothballed as new models are brought into service.

This is a substantial air fleet, second only to that of the United States, although it is still dependent on Soviet-era airframes. While some of these have proven amenable to extensive modernization, attempts to create wholly new designs, such as the Su-57 stealth fighter, represent, as already noted, quite a challenge. Nonetheless, Moscow is serious about building up its air forces both to defend the Motherland and also to support its Ground Forces in both defence and offence. It is a mark of the new emphasis on the vertical integration of forces that while, as of writing, commander-in-chief of the VKS Gen. Sergei Surovikin may wear air force blues, until 2017, he was a Ground Forces officer. He rose in the ranks of the mechanized infantry, fighting in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the Second Chechen War (where he was wounded in action) and in 2017 commanded the Russian contingent in Syria. He has a reputation not just as a tough and uncompromising soldier – in 2004, one of his subordinates shot himself in Surovikin’s office following a bad review – but also a problem-solver able to come up with creative solutions. He spent a tour in charge of the General Staff’s Main Operations Directorate, often the mark of a high-flier tipped for the top, and had already demonstrated his innovative capacities in 2012, when he was tasked with forming the new Military Police. His career has not been without controversies, but he has so far been able to survive them, whether the seven months he spent in custody after the 1991 August Coup (three men died during clashes when Surovikin was leading a battalion of troops loyal to the plotters) or when, in 1995, he was convicted of having stolen and sold a service weapon (the charge was later quashed). Nonetheless, he is regarded as perhaps best combining the decisiveness and future-oriented thinking Russia’s military needs, and his unprecedented second tour heading forces in Syria in 2019 was another signal that this is a man to watch – possibly even a future Chief of the General Staff.

The Air Forces and the Air and Missile Defence Forces (PVO-PRO: Voiska Protivovozdushnoy i Protivoraketnoy Oborony) are largely divided into four tactical Air and Air Defence Armies, one for each main military district: the 6th for the West, 4th for the South, 14th for the Central and 11th for the East. These field mixes of interceptors, tactical bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and ground-to-air missile systems. The 6th Air and Air Defence Army, for example, is based in St Petersburg and includes the 105th Guards Composite Aviation Division with three squadrons of interceptors, one of fighter-bombers and one of reconnaissance aircraft, the 2nd and 32nd Air Defence Divisions with seven regiments of SAMs, and also naval assets based in the Kaliningrad exclave: the 4th Independent Naval Aviation Attack Regiment, the 689th Guards Naval Aviation Fighter Regiment and the 44th Air Defence Division. All told, that accounts for 12 squadrons of combat aircraft, nine SAM regiments and five radio-technical regiments. It also has three regiments of helicopters and one of transport aircraft. Admittedly, the Western VO is a priority theatre, and is in any case supplemented by the special 1st Air Defence and Missile Defence Army, responsible for Moscow. This has two divisions (nine regiments) of SAMs and the 9th Anti-Ballistic Missile Defence Division. This last maintains the Don-2N battle management phased array radar site at Sofrino, north-east of the capital, and five launch sites with a total of 68 53T6 (ABM-3) short-range interceptor missiles. Given that they try to defeat incoming missiles by themselves detonating a 10-kiloton thermonuclear warhead in the stratosphere above Moscow, they are very much a last resort. Nonetheless, even if the Western VO is especially well provisioned (though the 6th does labour under one of the duller mottos: ‘Securely guarding Russia’s North-Western Sky’), this gives a sense of the kind of range of assets within one of these formations.

Long-Range Aviation remains separate, flying some 60 veteran TU-95MS Bear long-range turboprops, 50 smaller supersonic Tu-22M3 Blinders and 17 of the newer Tu-160M2 ‘Blackjack’ swing-wing bombers. Although subordinated to the commander-in-chief of the VKS and also used for conventional fire missions, all playing a role in the Syrian campaign for example, they are part of Russia’s nuclear triad, and thus DA is discussed below in Chapter 25 along with the Space Troops, which likewise are subordinated not to the VOs but to Aerospace Command in Moscow.

## Defence of the Motherland

Some Western (especially US) strategic planners have become increasingly alarmed about what they call a growing problem of Russian A2/AD, standing for ‘Anti-Access and Area Denial’. The central notion is that, with a combination of long-range anti-shipping and anti-air missiles, the Russians could counter Western freedom of manoeuvre and its technological and mobility edge. As with so many of these ‘new way of war’ scares, it is both overblown and also a misunderstanding of Russian doctrine. As Michael Kofman put it:

Russian ‘A2/AD capabilities’ have also become woefully overhyped, often depicted as some kind of defensive bubbles or no-go zones on a two-dimensional map. Illustrations of Russian air defense range rings or missile rings, popularized by media, have at times reduced Russia military analysis to the study of angry looking red circles on a map.2

To be sure, Moscow has developed quite extensive anti-shipping and, especially, anti-air capabilities. However, the idea that it would sit safely in any such bubble misunderstands both the impenetrability even of modern, integrated air defence systems (some attacks will get through) and also the Russian style of war (which relies on its capacity actively to degrade the enemy and counter-attack).

Instead, Moscow’s particular concern is the threat of a Massed Missile-Aviation Strike (MRAU: Massirovany Raketno-Aviatsionny Udar), that NATO would use its numerical strength and technological edge in the air to begin a conflict with a devastating blow intended to shatter Russian command and control structures, degrade its manoeuvre forces and generally try to win any war at first blow. This too may be overhyped: for every Western concern that the Russians have some new conceptual approach that gives them some fearsome edge, so too the Russians tend to over-estimate the capacities of Western military technologies. In any case, this has brought a greater urgency to the air defence mission of the VKS, and it is significant that the most recent iterations of the massive Zapad military exercises that are held every four years in western Russia and Belarus have begun with a simulated ‘blue’ MRAU that the ‘red’ defenders must resist, defeat or, in the worst cases, weather, before moving onto the counter-attack.

Ground Forces units have their own integral air defence elements, while PVO-PRO forces are not a battlefield but a strategic asset, deploying both interceptors and ground-based S-350, S-400 and S-500 long-range missile systems, supplemented by short-range systems such as the Pantsir-S1 (SA-22), a mobile vehicle mounting its own radar as well as two 30mm guns and 12 missiles. In the initial MRAU, their role is to ensure that the command structures that can muster and coordinate battlefield forces survive long enough to turn the conflict to their own advantage, especially as the enemy begins to run low not just on missiles, aircraft and pilots, but also on the information assets needed to launch its strikes, from communications networks to radars.

To this end, there is a sustained campaign to modernize Russia’s fighter fleet. The mainstay will be agile Su-30SM2 and Su-35S fighters, developments of the combat-proven Su-27 Flanker airframe, supplemented by lighter MiG-35s, although there seems less enthusiasm for this modernized version of the MiG-29 Fulcrum, and the current order appears as much as anything to keep the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in business. Eventually, the Su-57 stealth fighter is coming into service, with 76 on order, although no clear sense as to whether the target of deploying a full regiment of 24 of them by 2025 will be met.

## Fist of the Motherland

While recognizing the threat from Western aerial assets, the Russians have also placed much effort into developing their own attack capabilities. To a considerable degree, their way of thinking about the use of these forces is rooted in Soviet thinking. The notion of Deep Battle, pioneered by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky in the 19 20s, saw the path to victory as not just on the front line, but by shattering and disrupting the enemy’s forces throughout the depth of the battlefield, essentially seeking to overwhelm their capacity to coordinate and respond and break their lines of command and supply. This helps explain, for example, the Soviets’ enthusiasm for paratroopers able to land well behind the line of contact. This was originally something to be achieved primarily through major ground attacks deep into enemy territory, but by the 1970s another innovative military thinker, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, was looking at how long-range missiles, precision munitions and airstrikes could be used to supplement the corps-sized Operational Manoeuvre Group on the ground.

The Soviets lacked the capacity to build adequate quality and quantities of precision munitions for this truly to take root (to an extent, Russia still does), and instead relied on copious amounts of tactical airpower and artillery. However, the sight of the way Allied technology provided such a decisive edge during the 1991 Desert Storm campaign in Iraq made it clear how important this would be. Through the 1990s, Russian military theoreticians wrote about the power of long-range ‘non-contact warfare’, but the armed forces lacked the funds and leadership to do much about it. Since then, the Russians have made strides to catch up, and while much of this is about long-range systems such as the Iskander tactical missile or the Kh-101 air-launched cruise missile, it also speaks to the continued importance of battlefield airpower.

The VKS’s battlefield close air support capabilities are especially well represented by the dated, but still effective Su-25 jet and also a wide range of helicopter types. The Su-25 Grach (Rook) has been in service since 1981, and despite various upgrades is showing its age. Nonetheless it is a tough and hard-hitting aircraft, a fitting descendant of the legendary Il-2 Sturmovik of Second World War fame. Although there was talk of its being replaced with a new ground attack jet, in practice for the moment it is helicopters which are picking up any slack. The old bruiser is the Mi-24/35 ‘Hind’ flying tank, a gunship and assault troop carrier. However, the main ground attack role is now played by nimbler, dedicated attack helicopters: the Mi-24 Havok and the Ka-50/52, with its distinctive two contra-rotating coaxial rotors.

The strategic bombers will be discussed later, but in the medium-range bomber fleet, the old Soviet-era standard, the Su-24 Fencer, is slowly being replaced by the Su-34 Fullback, an all-weather supersonic fighter-bomber developed on the basis of the Su-27 fighter. It demonstrated its capabilities over Syria, with dramatically better avionics than the Su-24 and the capacity to carry 8 tonnes of bombs, rockets and missiles. The Su-24 will remain in service for some time to come, though, and in a neat workaround, given Russia’s continued shortage of precision-guided munitions and the systems necessary to use them effectively, it has been fitted with the new SVP-24 aiming system that accounts for speed, altitude, wind and the like to allow it to drop cheap ‘dumb’ bombs almost with the accuracy of pricy ‘smart’ ones.

## Heavy Lift

They may not be as exciting as high-flying interceptors, rocket-laden ground attackers and battlefield-scouring bombers, but the 225 or so transport aircraft of the VTA are not only essential to strategic mobility across this huge country, but they have also proven crucial to Moscow’s wider power projection. At peak, they were flying 2,000 tonnes a day in materiel to Syria.3 Furthermore, in January 2022, the president of Kazakhstan requested the intervention of a peacekeeping contingent from the CSTO (the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Moscow’s attempt to create a Eurasian NATO analogue) in the face of widespread protests that he rather unconvincingly claimed were mobilized by foreign terrorists. That Russian paratroopers were on their way in hours attests not only to their readiness, but also that of the VTA. Indeed, Russian transport aircraft also ferried the small Belarusian and Armenian contingents taking part in the deployment.

Until 2009 known as the 61st Air Army of the Supreme Command, the VTA has also incorporated strategic transport assets formerly within the Navy and Strategic Missile Forces, and it maintains a fleet based on four types of aircraft. The An-26 is a twin-engine turboprop tactical transport that can carry 40 people or just under 6 tonnes. The larger, four-engine An-12 can carry 100 paratroopers or 20 tonnes of cargo and acquired an infamous reputation in the Soviet–Afghan War as the ‘Black Tulip’ that also brought home the bodies of dead soldiers. The Il-76 is the standard heavy lifter, a rugged long-range jet able to carry 126 fully equipped paratroopers, 145 troops or 50 tonnes of cargo, albeit it is still dwarfed by the ten or so operational wide-bodied An-124 ‘Ruslan’ aircraft in service, each of which can carry 880 soldiers or 120 tonnes.

Nonetheless, the VTA, like every one of Russia’s air forces, is also showing the strain. That figure of 225 aircraft relates to those still flying – there are perhaps another hundred still on the books but not flight-worthy and probably being cannibalized for spare parts. There are maybe 90 Il-76s still operational, 40 An-26s, and 56 An-12s, as well as a last three dated An-22 turboprop heavy lifters. Indeed, much of the VTA fleet is getting old, and keeping them running is tough, especially as the Antonovs were built originally in Ukraine, so getting new components is a particular challenge now. Furthermore, the Il-76 workhorse is ill-suited to serious power projection. Whereas the An-124 can even carry three battle tanks in its cavernous hold, anything larger than the paratroopers’ deliberately low-profile vehicles needs to be dismantled to fit in an Il-76. Although a new Il-112V is meant to replace the increasingly dated An-26 as the standard light transport, the first prototype crashed in August 2021 and the project’s status is unclear. But while a modernized Il-76MD-90A began to be brought into service from 2018, though it may be a little longer-ranged and a little more efficient, it is no bigger. The VTA will have to lean heavily on those few An-124s in case of any serious future operations away from Russia and its railways.

## Drones

Russia may have come late to realizing the full capacities of the drone, but it is now a convinced fan, with more than 500, ranging from small scouts to missile-armed unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). Its own early examples were of indifferent quality, to say the least, but having observed how Georgia used Israeli Hermes 450s in 2008, Moscow opted instead to buy Israeli. First, in 2009, it bought 14 Bird-Eye 400, I-View Mk 150 and Searcher Mk II drones, and the next year, it concluded a $400 million contract to licence-produce the Bird-Eye 400 and Searcher Mk II as the Zastava and Forpost, respectively (both, confusingly, translate as ‘Outpost’). It used this to galvanize its own domestic production. Since then, drones have directed artillery fire onto Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, tracked rebel supply caravans in Syria and featured regularly in the over-excited broadcasts of the military’s own Zvezda (‘Star’) TV channel. Once, in 2021, three successive episodes of Voyennaya Priyomka (‘Military Acceptance’ – probably better translated as ‘Military Grade’) I watched had segments exalting the capabilities of Russia’s new drones.

Following the brief 2020 Azerbaijan–Armenian War, in which much was made of the Azeris’ use of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB-2 drones to hammer Moscow-supplied Armenian forces (albeit ones without the kind of integrated air defence system that would screen Russian troops), there was a clear attempt to demonstrate a similar or greater capacity. It is not just about showing off Russia’s own drones, such as the Forpost and Orlan-10 scouts and the Inokhodets-RU (‘Pacer’) and Orion UCAVs, able to drop bombs or launch missiles at a target. It is also about new capabilities. Most recently, an Orion was shown shooting down another drone with an air-to-air missile, opening up a new age of drone dogfights.

All that said, the Russians are still playing catch-up, not least because of shortages and deficiencies in some of the electronic and avionic systems. Their long-range strategic reconnaissance drone, the Altius, is really Moscow’s answer to the American RQ-4 Global Hawk, for example. Whereas the RQ-4 has been in use since 2001, though, the Altius is, as of writing, only just about to go into service. Likewise, while the new Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik (‘Hunter’), a heavy stealth UCAV, looks impressive in theory, it is still in the prototype phase. This is in part because of that perennial problem for all such projects, new capabilities and features such as a new, stealthier flat engine nozzle being added in the process. The idea is that it will be able to be networked with Su-57s or operate independently, but it is no more clear when it will be ready than Sukhoi’s manned stealth fighter-bombers.
