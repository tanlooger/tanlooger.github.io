title: 19 Rumble for Ruble
---



The question from the auditorium was the usual one: ‘How can Russia, with a defence budget close to the United Kingdom’s, afford to field a million-man army?’ This was at an event at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, but I’ve fielded variations on the same question at locales from Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia to the Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg. And it seems an entirely fair question. According to the official projections in 2019 (before COVID-19 upended everyone’s spending plans), Russia would be allocating 3.1 trillion rubles (which converts to some $47.7 billion) in 2020, 3.24 trillion rubles ($50 billion) in 2021, and 3.3 trillion rubles ($51.3 billion) in 2022. All told, that would mean the National Defence line in the state budget would be equivalent to 2.4% of GDP in 2020, 2.7% in 2021, and 2.6% in 2022.1

So far, so moderate. According to Treasury figures, British defence spending in 2019–20 was £54.5 billion, or around $72.5 billion, which would make it more than half as much again as Russia’s.2 Yet Russia maintains armed forces which are not quite a million strong – closer to 900,000 – which nonetheless dwarf the United Kingdom’s 153,000 active personnel. What is more, they have modernized on a massive scale, doing everything from deploying the new Borei-class nuclear missile submarine to finally replacing the venerable and under-powered 1950s-vintage Makarov standard service pistol. Never mind ‘bang for buck’, how does Russia get so much rumble for its ruble?

## When Comparisons Fail

This is a classic case where straightforward comparisons simply don’t work. In practical terms, the real level of Russian military expenditure is equivalent to perhaps three or even four times its paper value. First of all, much military-related expenditure is actually buried in other budget line items, from education to science and technology. This is easy to note, hard accurately to quantify. The national ‘Ready for Labour and Defence’ programme, a Soviet-era initiative designed not just to improve national health but also to ensure draftees join the military fit for service, was revived in 2007, and is paid for by the Sports Ministry. Much military research and development is conducted under the auspices of projects funded through civilian budgets. Certain troop movements by train are in effect covered by budget subventions to RZhD, the national rail operator. In times of war, the heavily armed Interior Troops of the National Guard would be fully integrated into the warfighting command. Yet technically it is just an internal security force, for all that its operators have already been deployed to Syria, so it falls under a different budget line. And so it goes: when the state is so committed to its mission of national defence – even if ‘defence’ may entail projecting power far from its borders – then even without the desire to mislead outsiders, military roles are threaded into so many aspects of government activity.

Much more serious is the impact of a crudely mechanical conversion of the ruble at market rates. For a start, historically, the ruble has often been a volatile currency (I can remember trips when a pound would buy me 65 rubles at the start of my visit, and over a hundred when I left), and the comparisons often suffer from when in the cycles of rising and falling market value they are made. More to the point, Russia is essentially self-sufficient in military terms. Everything from the research and development for its new systems to the procurement of kit, even buying food for its soldiers and fuel for its vehicles, is done domestically – using the ruble, not the dollar, pound or euro. Thus, a much better measure is what is called Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates, which factor in the differences in costs between countries. This helps explain, for example, why Russians are willing to join the armed forces on a professional basis. These so-called kontraktniki earn 62,000 rubles per month, which as of writing would be around £700 – vastly less than the £1,700 or so at which a British private’s salary starts. However, the average cost of living in Russia is around £450 a month (almost two-thirds that kontraktnik’s salary), compared with £1,250 in the United Kingdom (almost three-quarters the private’s). So while the Russian soldier looks much worse off, in relative terms, he is doing at least as well as his British counterpart.

Obviously, national economics are somewhat more complex, but the basic principle holds true. Indeed, if anything the Kremlin has even further advantages, such as its capacity to be more ruthless with its defence industries if it chooses, to constrain their profits, and its continued use of cheap conscripts. All told, when compared on the basis of PPP, Russian military spending is actually holding quite steady at around £110–130 billion ($150–180 billion) annually, or two to two-and-a-half times the United Kingdom’s defence budget, and that only applies to the official figures. Factor in the hidden spending, and it could be more like £145 billion ($200 billion).3 On this basis, Russia has consistently remained the fourth largest military spender in the world, behind only the United States, China and India. (The same issue of trying to assess real expenditure by market-rate exchange comparisons leads to a serious under-estimate of Chinese rearmament, something of which we should all be aware.)

Every year sees the government issue its State Defence Order (GOZ: Gosudarstvenny Oboronny Zakaz), a budgeted plan for procurement within the multi-year State Armament Plan (GPV: Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya), the result of painful and often acrimonious wrangles between the arms of service, the Defence and the Finance Ministries, and lobbyists for various regions and industries, presided over by the powerful Security Council Secretariat. Equally, each year sees recriminations and excuses for failures to meet targets or standards. Admittedly, this is hardly unique to Russia, but it does highlight the limitations of the system: even having the money and the political will is not always enough to get the results the Kremlin wants.

After all, the money is generally there. The defence budget has been pretty constant, with occasional peaks reflecting the need to clear debts to the arms industries more than real rises, and the Kremlin is clearly aware of the need to avoid the kind of runaway military spending that ended up bankrupting the Soviet Union (although in fairness, its cumbersome, corrupt and creaking planned economy was heading towards eventual collapse regardless). In any case, the bulk of the procurement scheduled under Putin’s modernization programme, needed to drag the armed forces into the 21st century, has been completed. Although, as discussed below, it is likely to be slower and harder to finish the job, nonetheless progress has been impressive.

## ‘Let us starve, but let us export’

You don’t often get management consultants quoting late 19th-century finance ministers, but when I visited an arms export fair in 2012, one did work into his speech a line from Minister Ivan Vyshnegradsky. In 1891, he infamously declared, ‘Let us starve, but let us export’, in the name of modernizing Russia’s industries, even as famine raged in the countryside. Things were obviously in no way as serious then, but the contemporary parallel being drawn was the way that the Russian armed forces were ‘starving’ – something of an exaggeration, it had to be said – because the arms companies were so keen to export. In other words, export orders that earned foreign currency were jumping the queue, leaving domestic ones delayed.

Of course, this is hardly surprising given the tight margins the state forces on arms companies when they sell local, and much R&D and plant modernization capital has been on the back of exports. The Russians have three advantages – they have a lot of good products, a lot of cheap products, and in the main they will sell (almost) anything to (almost) anyone – which they have exploited to the fullest. Thus, as of 2021, they remained second only to the United States in their share of global arms exports. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in the period 2016–20, they accounted for 20% of the total, by value (the United States was at 37%), almost equivalent to the next four largest (France, United Kingdom, Germany, China) combined.4

It is all the more impressive that it has done so, considering the state of Russia’s defence-industrial base. Putin has, from his first year as president, put serious resources and political capital into reforming his military, and turning it from being a cut-down version of the Red Army to a modern, capable force that is able to project power even away from Russia’s borders. Yet it has done so under some distinctive handicaps.

Since 2014, for example, it has had to cope with the loss of access to Ukraine’s defence industries (which used to produce several crucial components, not least the gas turbine engines originally intended for Russia’s new frigates) and also some Western technologies. These are essentially technical challenges, and Russia’s industries have largely been able to make up for these absences, albeit at a cost in time and money. Consider, for example, the case of Project 22350, a crucial design meant to replace Soviet-era Neustrashimy- and Krivak-class frigates. The intention was that they would be fitted with combined-diesel-and-gas engines (CODAG), marine engines made by Ukraine’s Zorya-Mashproekt enterprise. The first, the Admiral Gorshkov, did indeed receive them before the conflict, and was commissioned in 2018. However, then the problems started. The second in what is planned to be at least 15 ships, the Admiral Kasatonov, was then fitted with combined gas turbine and gas turbine engines instead, and only in 2018 was Russia’s United Engine Corporation able to deliver the first of two M55R CODAG engines to the Severnaya Verf shipyard in St Petersburg for the third ship, the Admiral Golovko. The fourth, the Admiral Isakov, only got its engines in 2021. To be fair, it seems almost impossible to find a major military construction project anywhere in the world that goes to schedule these days, but although there were also the inevitable teething problems with the ships’ systems, the delay in commissioning these relatively small workhorses does, as will be discussed later, raise doubts about any plans to build larger ships up to and including aircraft carriers.

## The Metal-Eaters

In any case, rather more important are the structural weaknesses of the sector that former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev called the ‘metal-eaters’. There was an old joke that the Soviet Union did not have a military-industrial complex – it was a military-industrial complex. The ‘metal-eaters’ had inordinate power and almost every aspect of the economy was channelled towards military production and power, whether the way that every truck and lorry had its so-called avtokolomka designation so that it could be mobilized in time of war, to the way the defence companies got first pick of raw materials and components. It is hard to see the same kind of dominance now. More generally known as the oboronka, after oborona, the Russian word for defence, the sector directly employs more than 2.5 million people, one in five of all Russian manufacturing jobs. Although there are some bright sparks of efficiency and innovation, they are in the main infamous for their Soviet-era habits of inflexibility, corruption and close ties with the state. Not only do they depend on the government for sales, and the state-owned Rosoboronexport agency for overseas business, but many are wholly or partially owned by Rostec, Russian Technologies, whose cumbersome full name is the State Corporation for Assistance to the Development, Production and Export of Advanced Technology Industrial Product Rostec. As the name suggests, this is a state-owned holding conglomerate that invests in strategically important companies, especially in the high-technology and defence sectors. Big beasts such as Uralvagonzavod (which builds the T-80 and T-14 tank, along with lines such as railway rolling stock), the United Aircraft Corporation (which includes such marques as MiG, Sukhoi and Tupolev), Russian Helicopters and Kalashnikov are all part of the Rostec stable – and its Chief Executive Officer is Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who worked alongside Putin in East Germany in the 1980s and is still very much one of his inner circle.

No wonder, then, that the Kremlin is able to squeeze the ‘metal-eaters’ hard, demanding that they accept what it is willing to pay them. Sales, whether exports or for domestic use, have tended to be on the basis of low prices. A T-80 tank may be less capable than an American M1A1 but it also costs about half as much, and while the stealthy US F-22 Raptor may be much more capable than the Russians’ Su-35 Flanker-E, they have a unit cost of $150 million to $85 million, respectively. The trouble with selling cheap(er) kit is that it leaves much less of a margin for research and development, though, which is fantastically expensive these days. So they depend on state assistance, as well as state sales, and the government often pays partially or late, and demands new kit that stretches companies’ research projects to and beyond the limits. But they can hardly say no.

The result has been growing debt, as plants are paid late or partially by the state and have to take out loans to cover the shortfall. In 2016, the government paid off debts worth 800 billion rubles ($10.5 billion) and a further 200 billion ($2.6 billion) the next year. Then, in 2020, another 750 billion rubles ($9.8 billion) of debt was covered or restructured. Even so, Deputy Prime Minister for the Defence Sector Yuri Borisov admitted at the end of that year that the total debt stood at 3 trillion rubles ($39.5 billion).5 Some of these companies are spending about one-tenth of their debt each year just in servicing it, paying interest on loans that likely will never be repaid. Indeed, it has been suggested that more than one in ten of all defence-industrial enterprises are nearing bankruptcy, only being kept afloat by new loans or periodic government debt forgiveness. So the state saves on the one hand – but then has to pay for it with the other.

This inefficient model likewise manages also to hinder further development. Delays getting the new Su-57 stealth jet in service, for example, in part resulted from the difficulty that manufacturing company KnAAZ, the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant, had in getting all the necessary components. The price they had to pay for them (as suppliers sought to cover some of their debts) ended up being paid by the military, just so they could get their plane.6 It has also compounded problems with coming up with genuinely new designs, rather than evolutions of Soviet-era ones. This does not mean that the latter are not often excellent systems. The air force, for example, is significantly more effective thanks to its new Su-30 and Su-35 fighters and Su-34 fighter-bombers, regardless of whether they are all based on the Su-27 Flanker, an airframe that first flew in 1977 and entered service in 1985. Likewise, the T-72B3 and T-90 are modernized versions of older tanks, but have proven capable for all that. Much slower and less clearly successful have been the programmes to produce and field truly new systems, whether the T-14 Armata tank (the initial plan was to buy 2,300 by 2020; instead, the first 100 are expected to be delivered in 2022), the fifth-generation Su-57 multi-role fighter (originally 52 would be in service by 2020, and another 150–160 by 2025; only one non-test aircraft was in service by the end of 2021) or the fourth-generation Lada-class diesel-electric submarine (four to six were meant to be launched by 2015; as of 2022, only the prototype is operational).

Part of the problem is also the usual Kremlin fascination with gigantism, with having a few, politically controllable megacorporations dominating the sector. In the 2000s, a defence sector which, in fairness, did need serious rationalization, was largely consolidated into fewer than 20 such national champions. They had flashy logos and snappy adverts, but at heart they were often still very Soviet in their ways of doing business, hierarchical and bureaucratic. But this was no longer the planned Soviet economy, and they struggled to operate in an environment in which their suppliers of tools and components could charge whatever the market could bear. Back in Soviet times, for example, TVs sold to regular customers had a terrible reputation for reliability, in part because the factories which produced cathode-ray tubes were required by law to send their best products to defence plants for radar sets. Civilian factories got the rest. Now, if the defence companies want components – and if they have special requirements – they have to pay for them.

## Buyer Beware

Instead of being able to produce the best kit or source the best components, they often have to rely on politics. After all, they often actually have more political muscle than the generals. It is hardly unknown in the West for procurement decisions to be decided based on which factory or shipyard is in which constituency, or the scale of a manufacturer’s lobbying budget. It is at least as true in Russia. Indeed, this goes back to Soviet times, and often meant that the military ended up fielding parallel lines of weapons – like the T-64 and T-72 tanks or the T-80 and T-90 – whether it wanted to or not. Today, similar duplication is also rife. When the military announced the Typhoon design competition for a new, heavy mine-resistant armoured personal carrier, both the Ural and Kamaz corporations put forward their own versions. And both models, designed to achieve exactly the same purpose, are now in service.

A particularly good example may be the much-hyped new T-14 Armata tank. Back in 2015, on the fringes of a particularly dull military colloquium in Moscow (at which both Russian participants duly expressed their mutual desire for cooperation and friendship with the West, for all that they were already at daggers drawn over Ukraine), I got the chance to share a drink with some officers from the Kantemir Division. More formally the 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Order of Lenin Red Banner Tank Division named for Yuri Andropov, this is one of the elite ‘palace guard’ units based around Moscow. In 2009 it had briefly been converted to a brigade, but earlier in 2015 had been reconstituted as a full division, something about which they were all relieved.

The conversation, inevitably, turned to tanks. The 4th was equipped with the T-80U, but that year it was announced that they were going to be one of the first to receive some of the 2,000 T-14 tanks the Defence Ministry was going to buy from Uralvagonzavod. The T-14 is the first truly new-generation Russian tank, a supposed marvel of modern electronics, with an unmanned turret mounting a fully automated, high-power 125mm 2A82-1M gun, and an armoured capsule within the main hull for the three crew. How excited were they about this? The conversation followed what I found to be the familiar trajectory when a nosy Brit starts asking these kinds of questions. First, the official line: that this was an honour, that the Armata was the most advanced tank of its kind, that it was a mark of the prowess of Russia’s military technology. But after a while, a more nuanced perspective emerged. Was it just too expensive? Was it needed? Above all, was it just too advanced, potentially too finicky for the real battlefield?

Although to an extent this is a carry-over from the days of the Second World War, when rugged but simple Soviet vehicles often were fixed in battle with all kinds of field expedients and the expertise a driver might have gained repairing a collective farm’s combine harvester, there is nonetheless some truth to the proposition that Soviet vehicles were quick to break down, but also quick to get moving again. What about the T-14 Armata, with all its fancy, solid-state electronics? The fear was that when it suffered anything more serious than a thrown track or a jammed gun, all that could be done was trundle it back to a specialized repair depot. It was, they concluded, not so much the tank the army needed, but the tank Uralvagonzavod wanted to sell them.

While the T-14 looks impressive on paper, Uralvagonzavod is a major employer, and in 2011, when Putin was facing angry protests against his re-election, a foreman from the tank production plant at Nizhny Tagil offered to come to Moscow ‘with the guys’ to deal with them. It became something of a media sensation, not least as it played to the Kremlin’s efforts to portray the protesters as middle-class elitists, out of touch with ‘real Russia’. The foreman, Igor Kholmanskikh, was later made a presidential representative, and Uralvagonzavod got the Armata contract. Putin knows to reward loyalty.

Those Kantemir officers may have had a point. Although they were meant to have received their T-14s by 2018, as of writing – mid-2022 – they are still fielding T-80Us. As well as running late the project is also coming in over-budget: the price tag for the new tanks has gone up from 250 million to 450 million rubles (£2.5–4.4 million) per unit. Partly as a result, as mentioned previously, the order has shrunk from 2,300 by 2020, to 100 by the end of 2022. And shortly after that colloquium, in the rehearsals for the annual Victory Day parade, one of the eight T-14s being shown off for the first time broke down in full view of the cameras. An attempt to tow it failed, but then it was able, after some 15 minutes of frantic tinkering, to drive off under its own steam. The announcer tried to pass it off as part of a planned test, but no one was fooled.

## Modernizing the Military

For all that, the system works, in its own way. As of 2021, according to the Defence Ministry, 71% of all ships, submarines and aircraft, 85% of helicopters, 79% of artillery pieces, 82% of armoured vehicles and 100% of ground missile systems were officially rated as ‘modern’. The service break-down was 85% of Ground Forces kit, 80% for the air force, and 85% for the navy.7 One could quibble as to quite what this means – much of the ‘modern’ kit is simply updated versions of Soviet-era designs – but it nonetheless represents an impressive response to the crisis which had gripped the Russian military.

After all, most armed forces renovate themselves all the time, constantly repairing, modernizing and only then replacing equipment that, in such circumstances, can continue to be serviceable for decades. The American F-15 fighter entered service in 1976, but thanks to rolling upgrades is still going strong. By the later 1980s, though, the Soviet R&D complex was in crisis as the money dried up and Gorbachev looked to disarmament. The 1990s saw next to no serious procurement or modernization programmes, nor even the funds or the interest in basic upkeep. Even when Putin came to power in 2000, the initial focus had to be on personnel. The result was more years of neglect, such that in 2008, when mighty Russia took on tiny Georgia, more than a quarter of all the armoured vehicles deployed simply broke down before they even reached the battlefield.

So much of the older kit was simply beyond practical or economic repair or refurbishment, that no wonder modernization became such a priority for successive defence ministers. It meant not just the difference between the leading-edge and the still-serviceable, but it often meant the gaping gap between the usable and the unusable. Of course, there are weapons which have rather longer lifespans. Although the AK-74 rifle, introduced in – predictably enough – 1974, is scheduled for replacement by the AK-12, in practice it will remain in use for years to come. That is no great drawback, though, as the later AK-74M (issued from 1991) is still a perfectly effective weapon. However, the advances in everything from precision munitions to targeting and sensor systems meant that replacing the most venerable and vulnerable kit had to be a priority – and to a large extent, the Russians have accomplished this. As will be explored in the following chapters, thanks to deep reforms on the level of organization, doctrine and equipment, Gerasimov’s proud boast that ‘the Armed Forces are now arriving at a fundamentally new level of combat readiness’ did not seem that misplaced – until, that is, his military was tested in a true, full-scale war in Ukraine.8
