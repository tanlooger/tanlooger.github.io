title: 5. Bad Manners
---




A servant rang a bell. Other servants began carrying in large silver bowls, platters, and trays.

“It is time for dinner now,” said Nan. “ We must go, Wolfie. We have to find Papa.” She helped her little brother put his wig back on.

“But I want to stay with Jack and Annie,” whined Wolfie. “I want to play with them in the garden.”

“Not now,” said Nan. She grabbed Wolfie’s hand. “It was nice to talk to you,” she said to Jack and Annie. “And I hope we can see you perform again someday, Jack.”

Jack forced a smile. “Uh … yeah, thanks. Hey, let us know what your dad—I mean, your papa— says about the brilliant artists living in the palace,” he said. “Maybe you can meet us later by those double doors?”

“Yes, after dinner, we will meet you,” said Nan.

“And then we will play in the garden!” said Wolfie.

“No, you and I will have other things to do, Wolfie, remember?” said Nan. “Come along now.” She pulled her little brother away.

“But I want to play with Jack the Clown!” Wolfie wailed.

Jack and Annie watched Wolfie and Nan disappear into the crowd.

“I am not a clown,” Jack said darkly.

“Don’t worry about him,” said Annie. “He really admires you.”

“Lucky me,” said Jack.

The bell sounded again. People started moving toward the dinner tables.

“Where should we sit?” said Annie.

“Anywhere,” said Jack, “as long as we’re out of the way.” He still wanted to hide from the imperial children. “What about that table at the end of the room? Near the door?”

“Sure.”

Jack led the way to the table at the far end of the room. “Let’s grab seats while we can,” he said to Annie.

As grown-ups hovered near the table talking and laughing, Jack and Annie sat down in two chairs. Steaming platters of food lined the middle of the table: beef stew, mashed potatoes, sausages, dumplings, cabbage, spiced apples, and gingerbread.

Jack’s mouth watered. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was. “Okay, here’s our plan,” he said to Annie. “We’ll eat first. Then Nan will tell us where all the artists live, and we’ll get to work.”

“Excuse me, young man and young lady,” someone said in a snippy tone.

Jack and Annie turned around in their chairs. An elderly couple stood glaring at them.

“The empress herself designed the seating plan,” the man said. “And I can assure you these are not your seats.”

“Furthermore,” said the woman, “no one sits until Her Imperial Majesty is seated.”

Jack and Annie jumped up from their chairs.

“Oops!” said Annie.

“Sorry!” said Jack.

“Our mistake,” said Annie. “Excuse us.”

Jack and Annie walked away from the table. “That was bad manners,” Annie said to Jack.

“Who, us or them?” said Jack.

“Us,” Annie said. “I wonder where our seats are.”

“I have a feeling we’re not a part of the empress’s seating plan,” said Jack. His face felt hot again. His wig itched like crazy.

Suddenly a hush fell over the room. The harp and violin music stopped. Everyone stopped talking.

Her Imperial Majesty had entered through the main doors. The imperial children followed her. Her Majesty led them to the table in the middle of the room. Everyone else stood silently, waiting for the imperial family to sit down.

“ We have to get out of here now,“ Jack whispered to Annie. “Soon we’ll be the only ones left standing.”

“Like musical chairs,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “Forget dinner. Let’s go look for where the artists are staying. We can’t wait for Nan to ask her dad.”

As all the guests sat down, Jack and Annie hurried toward the door.

“Jack the Clown!” came a high voice.

Jack looked over his shoulder. Wolfie was waving from one of the tables.

Annie waved back.

“Don’t wave! Keep going,” said Jack. He grabbed Annie’s hand and pulled her out of the party room. They hurried into yet another elegant room with red velvet furniture and gold-trimmed walls.

“Keep going,” said Jack. He led the way into another fancy room.

“Jack and Annie, wait!” came a cry.

“I hear Wolfie!” said Annie.

“Darn!” Jack quickly closed the door behind them. “Keep moving!” he said.

“ We can’t,” said Annie. “That’s mean. We should wait for him.”

“But he’ll slow down our mission!” said Jack. “When are we going to get started?”

“Calm down,” said Annie. “We’ll just tell him we can’t hang out with him now because we have something important that we have to do.”

Jack heaved a sigh. “Okay.”

“Jack! Annie!”

Jack opened the door.

Wolfie ran right into him. “There you are!” the little boy said, smiling. “I was looking for you!”

“No kidding,” said Jack.

“Yes!” Wolfie said. “Are you leaving?”

“Not yet, we have to do something important,” said Jack. “And you can’t come with us.”

Wolfie’s smile vanished.

“Sorry,” said Jack.

“But I want you to come to the garden with me,” said Wolfie.

“Not now,” said Jack. “Wolfie, listen to me. Listen carefully. Annie and I have to do something really, really important. And we have to do it all by ourselves.”

Wolfie’s bottom lip started to quiver. Oh, no, thought Jack. He’s going to cry.

A tear ran down the little boy’s cheek.

“Aww, Wolfie, don’t cry,” Annie said gently.

“Wolfie! Wolfie!” someone called. Nan burst into the room. “Wolfie, what are you doing? Papa is very upset!”

“I want to play with Jack and Annie,” said Wolfie. Another big tear ran down his cheek.

“Please, Wolfie,” Nan begged. “You know you have a big responsibility tonight. You have to—”

“No!” wailed Wolfie, stamping his foot. “No, no, no! I never get to play!”

“Wolfie, stop!” said Nan. “Please do not be this way. Not now, of all times! You will kill Papa!”



“Wolfie! Wolfie!” came a deep voice.

“He’s in here, Papa!” Nan called. “Come, Wolfie.” She took Wolfie’s hand, but he pulled away from her.

“No! I want to play!” shouted Wolfie. And he charged out of the room.

“Wolfie?” A portly man in a wig burst through another door. “Where is he? Where is my son?”

“Oh, Papa!” said Nan. “Wolfie ran away!”

“Ran away?” The man threw his hands in the air. “ We must find him!” he cried.

“Papa, calm down!” said Nan.

“ We will fail utterly without him!” cried her papa. And he rushed out of the room.

“Papa! Papa!” yelled Nan. And she hurried after her father.
