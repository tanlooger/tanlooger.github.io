“Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” Jack sighed. “And right now he’s just a little kid.”

“So I guess we did our mission,” said Annie. “Remember what Wolfie said to Nan? He said we made him love music again. So I guess we put him back on the path to giving his gifts to the world.”

“Yep, and now we can leave,” said Jack. “Whew.” He was ready to get out of his fancy clothes and wig and go home and have a good dinner.

“Let’s go say good-bye to Wolfie,” said Annie.

As Jack and Annie started toward Wolfie, Her Imperial Majesty was laughing at something he had said. “You are truly a young magician, my little Wolfgang Mozart!” she said.

“No, not me,” said Wolfie. “Jack and Annie are the true magicians!”

“Who?” said Her Imperial Majesty.

“Over there,” said Wolfie, pointing across the room. “Jack! Annie!” he called.

All eyes turned to Jack and Annie.

“Look! It’s Jack of Frog Creek!” said one of the imperial children.

Jack froze, horrified.

“Jack is a clown,” said Wolfie. “And he plays magic music on his flute. And Annie sings beautiful magic songs. I just heard them.”

“Really?” said Her Imperial Majesty. She raised her eyebrows. “Well, Jack and Annie. Perhaps you will perform for all of us here as well?”

Everyone was silent, waiting for an answer from Jack and Annie.

“Um, well, you see …,” Jack began.

“Sure,” said Annie with a big smile. “We’d love to perform for you.”

Oh, no! thought Jack.

“Yes! Sing for us! Play for us!” said Wolfie, clapping his hands. He ran to Jack and Annie and pulled them toward the front of the room.

Annie leaned close to Jack. “You play; I’ll sing,” she whispered.

“But the flute won’t make magic anymore,” Jack said out of the corner of his mouth.

“Do the best you can,” whispered Annie. She smiled at the crowd.

Jack could hardly breathe. This is worse than facing the leopard and bear! he thought.

“Me, then you,” Annie said to him.

Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the silver flute. Annie started singing:

We came in a coach,

In a wig and a gown.We came to Vienna,

Me and the clown.

Annie turned to Jack. As everyone watched him, he held the instrument in a playing position. He desperately hoped a little magic still lingered in the flute. He blew air over the mouthpiece.

No sound came out. All anyone could hear was Jack’s huffing and puffing.

Wolfie giggled. “See! Jack’s a clown!” he said.

Everyone laughed.

Okay, thought Jack, if they want a clown, I’ll be a clown. Jack put on a goofy face. He looked into the end of the flute, as if searching for its missing sound. He jerked back his head, as if something had shot out of the flute and hit him in the eye.

Everyone laughed harder.

Jack liked hearing their laughter this time. He made a big show of wiping his eye. Then he gave Annie a silly grin.

Annie shook her head and sang:

My brother’s a fool,

He’s always around.

Why is it always

Me and the clown?



Jack pretended to bonk her on the head with his flute. He tried playing again, but again no sound came out. He turned the flute upside down and shook it, as if he were trying to shake out some music.

Annie rolled her eyes, to show she thought Jack was hopeless. Then she nodded at him, motioning for him to walk with her. As they moved away from the front of the room, Annie sang the last verse of her song:

It’s time to go,

It’s time to leave town.

Good-bye from me, and

Good-bye from the clown.

Crossing the room, Jack put the flute to his lips again. As he followed Annie to the door, he looked at the crowd and winked. Then he started to make up his own flute sounds. “Tweetle-tweetletweetle!” he sang. “Toot-toot-ah-roo!”

The audience laughed. When Jack saw Nan laughing hard, it spurred him on, and he did a little dance step. “Peep-peep-peep-ah-lee!” he sang, pretending to play the flute. “Peek-peek-a-boo!”



At the door, Jack and Annie stopped. Jack held the flute to his side and bowed. Annie curtsied at the same time. The audience laughed and clapped. Together Jack and Annie waved to the crowd.

“Bye, Wolfie!” shouted Annie. She blew kisses to him. “Keep making music!”

“Have a great life, Wolfie!” shouted Jack.

“Bye, Jack! Bye, Annie!” yelled Wolfie. “I promise I will never forget you!”

Jack bowed very low, and Annie curtsied again.

“Rise,” said Her Imperial Majesty, laughing.

Jack and Annie straightened up, waved one last time, and slipped out the door.
