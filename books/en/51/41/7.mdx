title: 7. Follow Me
---




“Stand back!” Wolfie shouted at the leopard. “I have a sword! And I’m not afraid to use it!”

“Oh, brother,” whispered Jack. There was no way Wolfie’s tiny sword could ward off the huge leopard. But if Jack and Annie rushed in to rescue Wolfie, the leopard might leap up and attack him.

Annie nudged Jack’s arm. She pointed at the pocket of his coat. She held up her hands, pretending to play a flute.

Jack had forgotten all about their magic flute! He remembered Teddy’s words: Playing this flute will deliver you from danger.

But what can the flute do? Jack wondered. How can it help us? He reached into his pocket and pulled out the flute anyway.

“You play—just blow over the mouthpiece,” whispered Annie. “I’ll make up a song. Remember, whatever I sing will come true.”

Jack nodded and held up the magic flute. It glistened in the light of the moon. Jack wasn’t sure he was holding it right, but he hoped it wouldn’t matter. He closed his eyes and blew gently across the mouthpiece.

Music streamed from the silver instrument! The pure sound wafted through the air like a feather on the wind. The melody was simple, yet beautiful.

Annie started singing, making up a song:

Leopard, hey, leopard,

Listen to our sound.



The leopard turned its head and looked at Jack and Annie. It pricked up its spotted ears.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Clown? thought Jack. Is that me? He didn’t love Annie’s choice of words, but he didn’t have time to worry about it. The leopard rose to its feet and began walking toward Jack and Annie.

Jack was so scared that he almost turned and ran away. But he didn’t dare. He knew that as soon as he stopped playing the flute, the magic would end.

Annie tugged on Jack’s sleeve, and they started walking slowly down the path, back toward the palace. The leopard padded silently after them as Annie kept singing:

Wolfie, hey, Wolfie,

Jump down, jump down …

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Without a word, Wolfie bravely hopped down from the tree. He followed the leopard, Jack, and Annie. They all walked down the path between the trees. Jack had no idea where they were going. He only knew that he should keep playing, Annie should keep singing, and they should all keep moving.

Jack heard branches breaking. He heard grunting and snorting. The giant bear lumbered out from behind some trees. But Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

Bear, hey, bear,

No need to frown.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The bear followed Jack, Annie, the leopard, and Wolfie down the path. The moonlight grew brighter and brighter. The magic music was making the night as bright as day!

Next the hyena’s laugh rippled through the air. WHOOP-WHOOP! The hyena slunk out from behind a tree trunk.

Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

Hyena, hey, hyena,

We’re glad you’ve been found.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The hyena joined the parade.

More creatures appeared: the gazelle and the ostrich and the peacock. Annie sang to them as Jack played the magic flute:

Hey, gazelle! Hey, ostrich!

Hey, bird with a crown!

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The animals all joined the parade. Jack heard Wolfie laughing with joy. He looked back and saw the little boy waving his arms as if he were conducting the magic music, a big grin on his face.

Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

All creatures who fly,

Fly after this tune.All creatures who walk,

Walk under the moon.

All creatures who crawl,

Crawl over the ground.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Baboons and bunnies, snakes and squirrels, lizards and foxes—all the ordinary and extraordinary creatures in the woods followed Jack and Annie. On the other side of the wide square, candles twinkled in the rear windows of the palace. Jack wondered where he should lead all the wild creatures. Where was the zoo? How could he and Annie get the animals back into their cages?

But Annie had another idea, as she sang:

To your forests and plains,

Where you’re all free to roam,

To your lands near and far,

Go home now, go home …

Go home now, go home …

Go home now, go home …





As Annie sang the last words over and over, the creatures began to vanish into thin air. The leopard, bear, hyena, ostrich, gazelle, peacock, baboon, and crane all disappeared. Soon, the only animals left in the woods were the ones that belonged there.

Annie stopped singing, Jack stopped playing, and Wolfie stopped waving his hands. The bright light faded to silver moonlight, and the cats, squirrels, and bunnies scampered off into the dark. The garden became quiet and peaceful again, except for the chirping of crickets.

“Where did the wild animals go?” asked Wolfie.

“Home,” Annie said simply.

Jack put the flute back in his pocket and heaved a sigh. “Good work,” he said to Annie. “But did you have to keep calling me a clown?”

Annie giggled. “Sorry, but ‘clown’ sounds good with so many other words.”

“I’m glad they went home,” said Wolfie. “I wanted them to be free.”

“Listen, Wolfie,” said Jack. “Don’t ever, ever again try to free animals from a zoo. Someone could have gotten hurt!”

“I’m sorry,” said Wolfie. “I promise I’ll never do it again. But how did you make them follow you?”

“It wasn’t us,” said Annie. “It was our music.”

“Was it magic?” asked Wolfie.

“Yes, as a matter of fact it was,” said Annie.

“Music is magic,” said Wolfie thoughtfully. “I love music.”

“Cool,” said Jack.

“I really love it!” said Wolfie.

“Uh … good,” said Jack.

“I love it more than anything!” said Wolfie. He whirled around, clapping his hands and dancing for joy.

What a weird kid, thought Jack.

As Wolfie twirled, the palace clock sounded: bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.

“Seven,” said Annie. “Seven o’clock.”

Wolfie stopped twirling and stumbled dizzily. “Oh, no! I must go!” he cried. “I will be late!” Wolfie grabbed Jack and Annie. “Come with me! You have to come with me!”

“Uh, okay,” said Jack. Why is Wolfie so frantic? he wondered.

Wolfie pulled Jack and Annie toward the palace. “Hurry! I cannot be late!” he cried.

“Late for what?” said Jack.

Before Wolfie could answer, someone called his name. “Wolfie! Where are you?” It was Nan. She was standing on the back terrace of the palace. “Wolfie!” she called again.

“Coming!” shouted Wolfie. “Poor Nan! She is waiting for me! Papa is waiting for me! The whole world is waiting for me!”
