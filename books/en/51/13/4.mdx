title: 4. Scary Things

Jack pulled out his book and found a picture of the strong men. He read aloud:

Gladiators were slaves or criminals who fought in the amphitheater (AM-fuh- thee-uh-ter). They were forced to fight each other or wild animals like lions or bears. The people of Pompeii thought a gladiator fight was great fun.



“That’s not fun!” said Annie. “No wonder I think it’s weird here.”

“No kidding,” said Jack. “That’s not like our time at all.”

Jack and Annie watched as the guards led the gladiators away. They went toward a building that looked like an outdoor stadium.

“That must be the amphitheater,” said Jack. “Let’s check it out.”

“Oh, all right, but it’s not a library,” said Annie.

He and Annie started up the street toward the amphitheater. A large crowd had gathered near the entrance. Men and women cheered as the gladiators marched inside.

Jack and Annie started to follow them, but a guard held up his spear.

“No children allowed,” he said stiffly. “Run along now.”

“Yes, run along! Run for your lives!” came a raspy, hissing voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around. It was the soothsayer. She was waving her bony finger at them.

“Oh, no! Her again!” said Jack. “Let’s get away from here.” He started to take off.

“Wait!” said Annie. “I want to talk to her!”

“Are you crazy?” said Jack.

But before he could stop her, Annie ran up to the soothsayer.

Jack watched from a distance as the woman talked to Annie.

“Jack, come here! Quick!” called Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He sighed and went over to Annie and the soothsayer.

“Tell him,” said Annie.

The woman fixed her gaze on Jack.

“All the streams of Pompeii have dried up,” she said.

“Remember the stream near the olive grove?” said Annie.

“So what?” said Jack. “Maybe they just need rain.”

“No,” said Annie. “There’re more scary things. Tell him.”

“All the birds have flown away,” the soothsayer said.

Jack just stared at her.

“She said that all the rats left, too,” said Annie. “And the cows are making strange noises!”

“But why?” said Jack.

“The sea is boiling hot,” the old woman said. “And the ground shakes and speaks.”

“See, I told you!” Annie said to Jack.

“But why are these things happening?” Jack asked the soothsayer.

“Because the end is near,” she whispered hoarsely.

“We have to leave now!” said Annie.

“But what about the library?” said Jack.

“What library?” the soothsayer asked.

“Show her the story title, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack took the piece of paper from his bag. He showed the Latin writing to the soothsayer. “A book with this title is in a library in this town,” he said.

“So?” the old woman said.

“So we have to save it!” said Annie. She pulled out her secret library card.

The soothsayer stared for a moment at the card and the shimmering letters on it. Then she smiled warmly at Jack and Annie.



“Yes, I understand now,” she said. “The only library I know is in the house of Brutus.” She pointed to a large villa at the end of the street. “Look there. Quickly.”

“Will Brutus mind?” said Jack.

“Brutus and his household are all in Rome,” the soothsayer said. “That is merely their vacation villa.”

“But we can’t just go in and take something of theirs,” said Jack.

The old woman shook her head sadly. “After today, there will be nothing left in Pompeii,” she said. “Nothing at all.”

Jack felt a chill go down his spine.

“Go and get what you came here for,” said the soothsayer. “Then leave at once.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He grabbed Annie’s hand. “Come on!”

“Thanks!” Annie called to the old woman. “You should leave, too!” she added.

Then Annie and Jack started running to the vacation villa. They ran as fast as they could.
