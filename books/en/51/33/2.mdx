Annie laughed.

Jack opened his eyes. He and Annie were wearing purple and pink outfits with huge ruffled collars. On their heads were funny hats. On their feet were red slippers with big bows.

“Who are we?” Annie asked.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He didn’t feel like a wise and brave helper in his red slippers. He felt stupid.

Together Jack and Annie looked out the tree house window. They had landed in a small tree inside a walled garden. The sky was gray. Jack couldn’t tell if it was morning or evening, but the air felt damp and heavy, as if a storm was about to break.

“I guess this is Venice,” he said.

“Let’s check our book,” said Annie. She opened their research book and read aloud:

Today the city of Venice (say VEN-iss) is one of the most popular tourist spots in the world. It lies in a lagoon of the Adriatic Sea. Instead of roads, Venice has waterways called canals. People glide along the canals in shallow boats called gondolas (GON-duh-luz). A man called a gondolier (gon-duh-LEER) stands in the back of the boat and uses a long oar to propel the gondola through the water.



“That sounds like fun,” said Jack.

“Yep,” said Annie. She closed the book. “Let’s go.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “We don’t even know what our mission is yet.” He took out Merlin’s letter and unfolded it. He read aloud:



Jack pushed his glasses into place. “Hmm,” he said.

“I wonder who the Grand Lady is,” said Annie. “And why do we need to save her?”

“I’m wondering lots of stuff,” said Jack. “What about the King of the Jungle? We’re in a city, not a jungle. And what about that angel? And—”

“Let’s just take one thing at a time,” said Annie. “What are we supposed to do first?”

Jack looked back at the letter and read:

When waters rise beneath the moon,

Visit the Grand Lady of the Lagoon.

“So let’s start by finding the Grand Lady,” said Annie. She headed down the tree house ladder.

Jack put Merlin’s letter into his backpack, along with Morgan’s research book and Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes. Then he climbed down the rope ladder and caught up with Annie.

Jack and Annie walked over a pebbly path as the sky darkened. Good, thought Jack. It’s night. He didn’t want anyone to see him in his silly outfit—especially the red slippers with the bows.

“That must be the way out,” said Annie. She led Jack to a wooden gate in the garden wall and pushed it open.

Jack and Annie stepped through the gate onto a quiet, empty walkway. Next to the walkway was a narrow lane of water.

“I guess that’s a canal,” said Jack.

“And that must be a gondola,” said Annie. She pointed to a long, curved black boat rounding the corner. In the last light of day, the gondola was gliding silently up the canal toward them.

“Yikes,” whispered Annie.

There were two people in the boat—a gondolier and a passenger. Each wore a black cloak, white gloves, and a ghostly white mask. The masks had long, pointy noses shaped like bird beaks. The passenger sat in the middle of the boat, holding a lantern. The gondolier stood in the back, pushing a long oar through the water.

“They look a lot weirder than us,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack.

“Hello!” the passenger shouted.



The person’s voice was muffled behind the white mask. “Do you need help?”

“Yes!” Annie shouted back. “Can you take us to the Grand Lady of the Lagoon?”

“Yes, of course. She is back that way!” answered the masked passenger. “Come.”

“Great!” said Annie. She grabbed Jack’s hand and pulled him over to the gondola. The gondola rocked a bit as she and Jack climbed aboard and took seats between the gondolier and the passenger.

The gondolier pushed the gondola away from the landing. His long oar made soft splashes in the water as the boat moved up the canal.

Jack cleared his throat. “Um, excuse me,” he said. “Why are you wearing bird masks?”

“For Carnival, of course,” said the passenger. “That is why you are wearing clown costumes, no?”

“Oh, yeah, sure,” said Jack.

As the gondola slid through the canal, Jack snuck their research book out of his backpack.

“Oh, boy, a carnival!” Annie whispered to Jack. “I hope it has a roller coaster.”

“I don’t think they had roller coasters two hundred sixty years ago,” whispered Jack.

Jack looked up carnival in the index. He found the page. Then he and Annie silently read together:

For many centuries, Carnival has been the most famous yearly festival of Venice. For Carnival, people disguise themselves as anything they want to be. Rich, poor, male, female, young, and old—all are equal during Carnival.



“Look, that’s us,” whispered Annie. She pointed to a picture of a colorful costume with a white ruffled collar and red slippers with bows.

“Yeah, and that’s them,” whispered Jack. He pointed to a picture of a person dressed in a black cloak and a white mask with a bird’s beak.

Jack closed the book and put it away. The gondola people didn’t seem so weird anymore. But he still wondered why a grand lady was in terrible danger at Carnival.

As the boat glided around a bend, Jack caught his breath. He saw dozens of gondolas rocking on the choppy waters of a wide, open canal. They were all decorated with ribbons and flowers. Candlelight from their lanterns danced on the dark, rippling water.

“Look, that must be Carnival over there,” said Annie, pointing.

In the distance, thousands of candles twinkled along the shoreline. Sounds of laughter, clapping, and shouting floated over the water.

“Hold on tightly!” said the masked person in the front of the gondola. “The tide is high tonight!” As their gondola joined the fleet of boats heading toward Carnival, the wind picked up. The waves grew taller.

Jack and Annie held on to the sides of the boat. Jack heard a faint rumble of faraway thunder. He saw a zigzag flash of lightning in the distant sky. Is a storm coming? he wondered nervously. Is the storm part of the disaster that’s going to happen to the Grand Lady of the Lagoon?

“This is going to be fun, isn’t it?” said Annie cheerfully.

“Sure,” said Jack. He tried to shake off his worries as the wind and tide helped push the gondola toward the twinkling candles of Carnival.
