title: 6. Find Me at the Greasy Spoon
---




Streetlamps were coming on as Jack, Annie, and Dipper walked away from Jackson Square. When they came to Bourbon Street, vendors walked the sidewalks, calling out, “Ice cream!” “Lemon pie!” “Ham biscuits!”

“Hmm. Sounds good,” said Annie. “There seems to be lots of good food in New Orleans.”

“Best in the world!” said Dipper.

People were sitting outside dance halls and restaurants, laughing and talking, eating and drinking. Outside and inside, musicians were blaring away on their instruments.

“Hey, there’s Dipper! Sing something for us, Dipper!” the ice cream lady yelled.

Dipper waved and kept going.

“Hey, girl, can you play that trumpet?” a man called to Annie.

“Not till the time’s right!” Annie shouted.

“When’s that?” the man said.

“She’ll know it when she feels it!” Dipper shouted.

At the end of the block, under a streetlamp, a trio was singing in harmony. It was Little Mac, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney.

“Look, Dipper, it’s your friends again,” said Annie.

“I see ’em,” said Dipper. But he ignored the three boys and crossed the street.

Dipper led Jack and Annie down a narrow alley to the back of a shabby, run-down building. Good cooking smells came from inside. “Y’all wait for me outside this greasy spoon,” he said, and he slipped through the back door.

“What’s a greasy spoon?” asked Annie.

“Smells like it must be a restaurant,” said Jack.

Annie put down the trumpet. Jack put down his bag. They sat on the back steps of the greasy spoon. While they waited in the muggy twilight for Dipper, Jack wiped his forehead. He was starving and ached all over.

Soon Dipper pushed open the back door with his foot. He was carrying a big bowl and a tall glass. “I got us some gumbo stew and some lemonade to share!” he said. “Talk about good!”

“Oh, man, thanks,” breathed Jack.

Dipper sat between Jack and Annie on the steps. He pulled spoons out of his pocket for each of them. “Dig in, y’all!” he said.

Together the three of them tackled the gumbo stew. They all ate their fill of spicy chicken, ham, tomatoes, okra, onions, and rice. When the bowl was empty, they shared the tall glass of lemonade. Then they sat back on the steps and heaved big sighs. Jack felt stuffed and happy.

“Mighty fine,” breathed Dipper.

“Mighty fine,” echoed Jack.

“Mighty fine,” said Annie.

“Nothing tastes as good as gumbo after a hard day’s work,” said Dipper. He stood up. “Well, I have to leave y’all now. Thanks a million for your help today. And don’t forget to thank Teddy and Kathleen for sending y’all to find me.” Before Jack and Annie could stop him, Dipper climbed down the steps and vanished into the dark.

“Dipper?” called Jack.

There was no answer.

“He’s gone again!” said Annie.

“And we totally failed in our mission for Merlin,” said Jack. “We didn’t help Dipper get on the right path to give his gifts to the world.”

“I know. We have to find him. Come on,” said Annie. She hopped up and headed after Dipper.

“Wait, the trumpet!” said Jack. He grabbed the magic trumpet and his bag and followed her.

When Jack left the steps, it was too dark for him to see where Annie had gone. Thunder rumbled in the distance. The air felt heavy and thick as if the storm were about to break at any moment.

“Annie!” Jack called.

“Here!” Annie called back from the front of the restaurant. Jack joined her. Together they peeked through a window that looked into a large kitchen. Dipper was alone, washing a mountain of dishes.

“Why’s he doing that?” whispered Jack.

“Hey Dipper!” said Annie.

Dipper turned and smiled. “You caught me,” he said. He looked embarrassed.

“Why are you washing dishes?” asked Annie.

Dipper shrugged. “Got to pay for our dinner somehow,” he said.

“We’ll help you,” said Annie.

“We love washing dishes!” said Jack.

Dipper laughed. “Then come on in, potato heads,” he said. “I could use some help.”

Jack and Annie slipped through a side door into the hot, steamy kitchen.

Jack put down his bag and the trumpet. He and Annie picked up dirty plates from the counter. They began scraping leftovers into a garbage pail. They scraped fish heads, oyster shells, crab legs, shrimp tails, chicken bones, grease, and gravy off dozens of plates.

The work was messy and smelly. But Jack and Annie worked hard to keep up with Dipper. Every time he took a plate from them, he smiled and said, “Thank you.” He never frowned or complained or even seemed tired.

“Dipper,” said Annie while they worked, “your life seems really hard. How do you stay so cheerful?”

“Why not? It’s more fun to be cheerful than sad,” he said.

“Don’t you ever feel like getting mad or complaining about stuff?” said Jack.

“Sure I do, I’m human,” said Dipper. “I feel all kinds of things. All day long I feel things. You could say I have a rich life. I might not get to have everything. But I get to feel everything!” He laughed.

“I’m the same way,” said Annie.

“I thought so,” said Dipper. “That’s why I sure would like to hear you play that trumpet sometime.”

“Maybe you will,” said Annie.

By the time they finished washing dishes, rain was falling outside.

“Where to now?” said Jack.

“One more treat for y’all,” said Dipper. “Let’s leave this greasy spoon and head back down to the river. To the River Café for dessert! Come on.”

“We better not,” said Jack. “The waiters there don’t like us.”

“Don’t worry about them,” said Dipper. “You’re with me now.”

Jack and Annie followed Dipper outside into the rain. The wind was blowing harder now. “Uh-oh,” said Dipper. “Here comes the storm! Let’s hurry!”

Thunder cracked and rain began to pour down. The three of them got soaked as they hurried through the alley back to Bourbon Street.

The street was empty now. Partygoers and street musicians had fled from the storm. The restaurants and cafés had taken their chairs and tables inside. Lightning lit the sky, and thunder shook the ground. The wind was blowing hard, picking up sticks and leaves and trash.

“We have to find cover!” said Dipper. “Run!” He and Jack and Annie bowed their heads against the downpour and ran up Bourbon Street.

“Dipper! Over here, man!” someone yelled. It was Little Mack.

Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney were waving to Dipper from the doorway of a dark building on a corner. Dipper, Jack, and Annie ran across the street through the pounding rain.

“Get over here, out of the street!” shouted Little Mack. “Before you get hit by lightning!”

“Thanks, fellas!” said Dipper.

Soaking wet, Jack, Annie, Dipper, Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney all crowded together just inside the dark building, looking out at the storm.

“Who lives here?” asked Dipper.

“Nobody. It’s been empty for years,” said Happy.

“Used to be a blacksmith shop,” said Little Mack.

“Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop?” said Jack. He immediately stepped out of the shop and stood under the eaves.

“Yeah, what’s wrong with that?” asked Little Mack.



“We read this place is haunted!” said Annie.

“Y’all believe in ghosts?” asked Little Mack.

“No, not really,” said Jack.

“But I thought you said they gave you the heebie—” started Dipper.

“No, no, I was kidding,” Jack said quickly. He didn’t want Dipper’s friends to know he was afraid of ghosts.

Lightning split the sky again. Another crash of thunder shattered the night. The wind blew so hard that shingles blew off the roof across the street and crashed to the sidewalk.

“Whoa! Come inside, man, we gotta close the door,” Dipper said to Jack.

“Hold on,” said Little Mack. “We have to go.”

“We do?” asked Happy.

Little Mack whispered something to Happy and Big Nose Sidney.

“Oh, yeah, he’s right,” said Happy. “We have to leave. We’ll see y’all later.”

“Y’all are scared to stay here, aren’t you?” said Dipper.

“No, man. We forgot we have an important gig to play,” said Big Nose Sidney.

“Oh. Suddenly y’all have got an important gig. I see…,” said Dipper.

“Yeah, we’ll have to try to make it through the storm. See y’all! Come on, fellas!” said Little Mack.

The three boys hurried out of the blacksmith shop and turned the corner.

“They left ’cause they’re scaredy-cats,” said Dipper, chuckling.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “scaredy-cats.”

Thunder cracked the sky again, the loudest crack so far. It seemed to shake the whole block. Roof shingles flew through the air.

“Come back inside!” said Dipper. “It’s dangerous out there.”

Jack took a deep breath and stepped back into Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop.
