title: 8. Good Luck, San Francisco!

Jack and Annie ran over the cobblestones. Dynamite blasts echoed behind them.

They headed back down the hill. Flames shot across the roofs, traveling from one house to another.

“We’re heading right into the firestorm!” Jack shouted over the noise.

“We have to keep going,” Annie shouted back, “before the tree house catches fire!”

At the bottom of the hill, thick smoke was rolling through the street. It made Jack’s eyes burn.

“Where’s the tree house?” he shouted.

“Here!” said Annie.

Jack followed her voice.

She was holding on to the rope ladder.

“It’s still here!” Jack said with relief.

“Of course. The tree house wouldn’t leave without us,” said Annie. “Don’t you—”

“Go! Go!” said Jack.

Annie started up the rope ladder. Jack followed. They climbed into the tree house and looked out the window.

All around, buildings were going up in flames. Black smoke seemed to be smothering the city.

Jack could scarcely breathe. His throat burned. His eyes were stinging.

Annie grabbed their Pennsylvania book. She opened it to the picture of Frog Creek and pointed.

“I wish we could go there,” she said. “Good luck, San Francisco!”

“Good-bye, San Francisco!” said Jack.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.
