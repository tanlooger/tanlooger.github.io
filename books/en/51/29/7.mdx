title: 7. A Good Trick
---



As the wind blew away more fog, Jack and Annie saw a bridge. It was made of thick wooden planks held together with iron bands. It stretched all the way from the edge of the cliff where they were standing to the iron gate.

“Come on, let’s go!” said Annie.

“Wait!” said Jack. “What about the guards?”

The two guards in gold armor stood perfectly still. Their huge spears gleamed in the torchlight.



“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Read the second rhyme.”

Jack looked in his notebook and read aloud.

“Four gifts you will need—

The first from me.

Then a cup, a compass,

And, finally, a key.”

“The first gift is the Christmas Knight’s cloak,” said Annie.

“Yeah, I guess it’s supposed to help us somehow,” said Jack.

He unbuttoned the cloak from around his neck. Then he held it out to get a good look at it.

“Maybe it can make us invisible,” said Annie.

“That’s nuts,” said Jack.

“Seriously,” she said, “cloaks sometimes do that in stories.”

“Well, it didn’t make me invisible, did it?” said Jack.

“Maybe you were wearing it wrong,” said Annie. “Give it to me.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. But he handed the cloak to Annie. It flapped in the wind as she pulled it around her shoulders.

“Can you see me?” she said.

“Yes, Annie,” said Jack, rolling his eyes. “I can see you.”

Jack looked back at the gate. Even if we get past the guards, what then? he wondered. The Otherworld swallowed up Camelot’s best knights. King Arthur said it was filled with magic and monsters.

“Jack! Look at me now.”

Jack turned to Annie. She wasn’t there.

“Where are you?” he said, staring at the darkness.

“Cool, it works!”

“Where are you?” Jack said again, turning around.

“Here.”

Jack felt a hand touch his face.

“Ahh!” he said, jumping back.

“It’s me! I’m invisible! I pulled the hood over my head. That’s the trick.”

Jack felt a chill run down his spine.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

“Watch. I’m going to take the hood off.”

In a flash, Annie was back.

“It feels creepy to be invisible,” she said.

Jack was speechless.

“The magic only happens when you wear the hood,” said Annie. “Good trick, huh?”

“Uh—yeah,” said Jack. He shook his head. “This is just too weird.”

“Don’t worry about it being weird. It’s a great way to get past the guards,” said Annie. “Plus it’s a way to hide in the Otherworld. We don’t know what we’ll find there, right?”

“Yeah, right,” said Jack. “Okay.”

“Good,” said Annie. “Now, stand beside me and don’t move.”

Jack put away his notebook. Annie threw the velvet cloak over his shoulders and backpack.

“Great. It’s big enough for both of us,” she said. She carefully arranged the folds around them. Then she pulled the huge hood over both their heads.

Jack looked down. He couldn’t see his body at all! He felt like he couldn’t breathe. In a panic, he threw off the hood.

“I hate that!” he said.

“I told you it’s creepy,” said Annie. “But if we don’t wear it, we won’t get past the guards.”

“Yeah, I know, and we won’t have protection in the Otherworld,” said Jack. He took a deep breath. “Okay. Let’s do it.”

Annie pulled the hood up again.

“I’ll hold on to the hood so it won’t blow off,” she said. “You just think about getting across that bridge. Nothing else.”

“But I can’t see my feet,” said Jack.

“You don’t need to see your feet to walk!” said Annie. “Come on. Do it for Morgan!”

“Right,” said Jack.

He and Annie stepped onto the bridge.

“Whatever you do, don’t look down,” said Annie.

As they started over the bridge, the wind whistled around them. Jack couldn’t help it—he looked down.

Not only was his body missing, but the fog beneath the bridge was moving in a wild, spinning whirl. Jack felt dizzy and faint. He stopped.

“Keep going,” whispered Annie.

Jack took a deep breath and looked straight ahead. Then he started walking again. He went slowly—step by step—toward the pale light beyond the bars of the gate.

In the flickering torchlight, the guards looked like giants. As Jack and Annie slipped invisibly by them, Jack held his breath.

How will we open the gate? he wondered.

“WHOOOSSSHHH!” said Annie loudly.

Jack’s heart nearly stopped. Had Annie lost her mind? “What are you doing?” he whispered.

“I’m the wind!” Annie whispered back. “WHOOOSSSHHH!”

Annie gave the gate a shove. It swung open, as if pushed by the wind.

Jack looked back and saw that the guards had turned in their direction.

“Quick!” whispered Annie.

She and Jack moved silently through the gateway.

“WHOOOSSSHHH!” said Annie.

She pushed the gate back. It shut with a clang. Through the bars, Jack saw the guards face the bridge again.

“Good work,” he said to Annie.

“Thanks,” she said.

Jack and Annie then turned away from the gate.

“Ohh!” whispered Annie.

“The Otherworld,” whispered Jack.
