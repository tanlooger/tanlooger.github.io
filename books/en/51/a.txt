Here’s what kids have to say to

Mary Pope Osborne, author of

the Magic Tree House series:

WOW! You have an imagination like no other.—Adam W.

I love your books. If you stop writing books, it will be like losing a best friend.—Ben M.

I think you are the real Morgan le Fay. There is always magic in your books.—Erica Y.

One day I was really bored and I didn’t want to read … I looked in your book. I read a sentence, and it was interesting. So I read some more, until the book was done. It was so good I read more and more. Then I had read all of your books, and now I hope you write lots more.—Danai K.

I always read [your books] over and over … 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times … —Yuan C.

You are my best author in the world. I love your books. I read all the time. I read everywhere. My mom is like freaking out.—Ellen C.

I hope you make these books for all yours and mine’s life.—Riki H.





Teachers and librarians love

Magic Tree House® books, too!

Thank you for opening faraway places and times to my class through your books. They have given me the chance to bring in additional books, materials, and videos to share with the class.—J. Cameron

It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books … I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz

I discovered your books last year … WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora

I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home … I have since introduced this great series to my class. They have absolutely fallen in love with these books! … My students are now asking me for more independent reading time to read them. Your stories have inspired even my most struggling readers.—M. Payne

I love how I can go beyond the [Magic Tree House] books and use them as springboards for other learning.—R. Gale

We have enjoyed your books all year long. We check your Web site to find new information. We pull our map down to find the areas where the adventures take place. My class always chimes in at key parts of the story. It feels good to hear my students ask for a book and cheer when a new book comes out.—J. Korinek

Our students have “Magic Tree House fever.” I can’t keep your books on the library shelf.—J. Rafferty

Your books truly invite children into the pleasure of reading. Thanks for such terrific work.—S. Smith

The children in the fourth grade even hide the [Magic Tree House] books in the library so that they will be able to find them when they are ready to check them out.—K. Mortensen

My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney

For Linda and Mallory,

who took the trip with me




1. Into the Woods


“Help! A monster!” said Annie.

“Yeah, sure,” said Jack. “A real monster in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

“Run, Jack!” said Annie. She ran up the road.

Oh, brother.

This is what he got for spending time with his seven-year-old sister.

Annie loved pretend stuff. But Jack was eight and a half. He liked real things.

“Watch out, Jack! The monster’s coming! Race you!”

“No, thanks,” said Jack.

Annie raced alone into the woods.

Jack looked at the sky. The sun was about to set.

“Come on, Annie! It’s time to go home!”

But Annie had disappeared.

Jack waited.

No Annie.

“Annie!” he shouted again.

“Jack! Jack! Come here!”

Jack groaned. “This better be good,” he said.

Jack left the road and headed into the woods. The trees were lit with a golden late-afternoon light.

“Come here!” called Annie.

There she was. Standing under a tall oak tree. “Look,” she said. She was pointing at a rope ladder.

The longest rope ladder Jack had ever seen.

“Wow,” he whispered.

The ladder went all the way up to the top of the tree.

There—at the top—was a tree house. It was tucked between two branches.

“That must be the highest tree house in the world,” said Annie.

“Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.”

“I don’t know. But I’m going up,” said Annie.

“No. We don’t know who it belongs to,” said Jack.

“Just for a teeny minute,” said Annie. She started up the ladder.

“Annie, come back!”

She kept climbing.



Jack sighed. “Annie, it’s almost dark. We have to go home.”

Annie disappeared inside the tree house.

“An-nie!”

Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her head out of the tree house window.

“Books!” she shouted.

“What?”

“It’s filled with books!”

Oh, man! Jack loved books.

He pushed his glasses into place. He gripped the sides of the rope ladder, and up he went.



2. The Monster

Jack crawled through a hole in the tree house floor.

Wow. The tree house was filled with books. Books everywhere. Very old books with dusty covers. New books with shiny, bright covers.

“Look. You can see far, far away,” said Annie. She was peering out the tree house window.

Jack looked out the window with her. Down below were the tops of the other trees. In the distance he saw the Frog Creek library. The elementary school. The park.

Annie pointed in the other direction.

“There’s our house,” she said.

Sure enough. There was their white wooden house with the green porch. Next door was their neighbor’s black dog, Henry. He looked very tiny.

“Hi, Henry!” shouted Annie.

“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be up here.”

He glanced around the tree house again.

“I wonder who owns all these books,” he said. He noticed bookmarks were sticking out of many of them.

“I like this one,” said Annie. She held up a book with a castle on the cover.

“Here’s a book about Pennsylvania,” said Jack. He turned to the page with the bookmark.

“Hey, there’s a picture of Frog Creek in here,” said Jack. “It’s a picture of these woods!”

“Oh, here’s a book for you,” said Annie. She held up a book about dinosaurs. A blue silk bookmark was sticking out of it.

“Let me see it.” Jack set down his backpack and grabbed the book from her.

“You look at that one, and I’ll look at the one about castles,” said Annie.

“No, we better not,” said Jack. “We don’t know who these books belong to.”

But even as he said this, Jack opened the dinosaur book to where the bookmark was. He couldn’t help himself.

He turned to a picture of an ancient flying reptile. A Pteranodon.

He touched the huge bat-like wings.

“Wow,” whispered Jack. “I wish I could see a Pteranodon for real.”

Jack studied the picture of the odd-looking creature soaring through the sky.

“Ahhh!” screamed Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“A monster!” Annie cried. She pointed to the tree house window.

“Stop pretending, Annie,” said Jack.

“No, really!” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window.

A giant creature was gliding above the treetops! He had a long, weird crest on the back of his head. A skinny beak. And huge bat-like wings!

It was a real live Pteranodon!

The creature curved through the sky. He was coming straight toward the tree house. He looked like a glider plane!



The wind began to blow.

The leaves trembled.

Suddenly the creature soared up. High into the sky. Jack nearly fell out the window trying to see it.

The wind picked up. It was whistling now.

The tree house started to spin.

“What’s happening?” cried Jack.

“Get down!” shouted Annie.

She pulled him back from the window.

The tree house was spinning. Faster and faster.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. He held on to Annie.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes. Sunlight slanted through the window.

There was Annie. The books. His backpack.

The tree house was still high up in an oak tree.

But it wasn’t the same oak tree.



3. Where Is Here?

Jack looked out the window.

He looked down at the picture in the book.

He looked back out the window.

The world outside and the world in the picture—they were exactly the same.

The Pteranodon was soaring through the sky. The ground was covered with ferns and tall grass. There was a winding stream. A sloping hill. And volcanoes in the distance.

“Wh-where are we?” stammered Jack.

The Pteranodon glided down to the base of their tree. The creature coasted to a stop. And stood very still.

“What happened to us?” said Annie. She looked at Jack. He looked at her.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I was looking at the picture in the book—”

“And you said, ‘Wow, I wish I could see a Pteranodon for real,’ ” said Annie.

“Yeah. And then we saw one. In the Frog Creek woods,” said Jack.

“Yeah. And then the wind got loud. And the tree house started spinning,” said Annie.

“And we landed here,” said Jack.

“And we landed here,” said Annie.

“So that means … ” said Jack.

“So that means … what?” said Annie.

“Nothing,” said Jack. He shook his head. “None of this can be real.”

Annie looked out the window again. “But he’s real,” she said. “He’s very real.”

Jack looked out the window with her. The Pteranodon was standing at the base of the oak tree. Like a guard. His giant wings were spread out on either side of him.

“Hi!” Annie shouted.

“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be here.”

“But where is here?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Hi!” Annie called again to the creature.

The Pteranodon looked up at them.

“Where is here?” Annie called down.

“You’re nuts. He can’t talk,” said Jack. “But maybe the book can tell us.”

Jack looked down at the book. He read the words under the picture:

This flying reptile lived in the Cretaceous period. It vanished 65 million years ago.



No. Impossible. They couldn’t have landed in a time 65 million years ago.

“Jack,” said Annie. “He’s nice.”

“Nice?”

“Yeah, I can tell. Let’s go down and talk to him.”

“Talk to him?”

Annie started down the rope ladder.

“Hey!” shouted Jack.

But Annie kept going.

“Are you crazy?” Jack called.

Annie dropped to the ground. She stepped boldly up to the ancient creature.



4. Henry

Jack gasped as Annie held out her hand.

Oh, brother. She was always trying to make friends with animals. But this was going too far.

“Don’t get too close to him, Annie!” Jack shouted.

But Annie touched the Pteranodon’s crest. She stroked his neck. She was talking to him.

What in the world was she saying?

Jack took a deep breath. Okay. He would go down, too. It would be good to examine the creature. Take notes. Like a scientist.

Jack started down the rope ladder.

When he got to the ground, Jack was only a few feet away from the creature.

The creature stared at Jack. His eyes were bright and alert.

“He’s soft, Jack,” said Annie. “He feels like Henry.”

Jack snorted. “He’s no dog, Annie.”

“Feel him, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack didn’t move.

“Don’t think, Jack. Just do it.”

Jack stepped forward. He put out his arm. Very cautiously. He brushed his hand down the creature’s neck.

Interesting. A thin layer of fuzz covered the Pteranodon’s skin.

“Soft, huh?” said Annie.

Jack reached into his backpack and pulled out a pencil and a notebook. He wrote:



“What are you doing?” asked Annie.

“Taking notes,” said Jack. “We’re probably the first people in the whole world to ever see a real live Pteranodon.”

Jack looked at the Pteranodon again. The creature had a bony crest on top of his head. The crest was longer than Jack’s arm.

“I wonder how smart he is,” Jack said.

“Very smart,” said Annie.

“Don’t count on it,” said Jack. “His brain’s probably no bigger than a bean.”

“No, he’s very smart. I can feel it,” said Annie. “I’m going to call him Henry.”

Jack wrote in his notebook:





Jack looked at the creature again. “Maybe he’s a mutant,” he said.

The creature tilted his head.

Annie laughed. “He’s no mutant, Jack.”

“Well, what’s he doing here then? Where is this place?” said Jack.

Annie leaned close to the Pteranodon.

“Do you know where we are, Henry?” she asked softly.

The creature fixed his eyes on Annie. His long jaws were opening and closing. Like a giant pair of scissors.

“Are you trying to talk to me, Henry?” asked Annie.

“Forget it, Annie.” Jack wrote in his notebook:



“Did we come to a time long ago, Henry?” asked Annie. “Is this a place from long ago?” Suddenly she gasped. “Jack!”

He looked up.

Annie was pointing toward the hill. On top stood a huge dinosaur!



5. Gold in the Grass

“Go! Go!” said Jack. He threw his notebook into his pack. He pushed Annie toward the rope ladder.

“Bye, Henry!” she said.

“Go!” said Jack. He gave Annie a big push.

“Quit it!” she said. But she started up the ladder. Jack scrambled after her.

They tumbled into the tree house.

They were panting as they looked out the window at the dinosaur. He was standing on the hilltop. Eating flowers off a tree.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We are in a time long ago!”

The dinosaur looked like a huge rhinoceros. Only he had three horns instead of one. Two long ones above his eyes and one on his nose. He had a big shield-like thing behind his head.

“Triceratops!” said Jack.

“Does he eat people?” whispered Annie.

“I’ll look it up.” Jack grabbed the dinosaur book. He flipped through the pages.

“There!” he said. He pointed to a picture of a Triceratops. He read the caption:

The Triceratops lived in the late Cretaceous period. This plant-eating dinosaur weighed over 12,000 pounds.



Jack slammed the book shut. “Just plants. No meat.”

“Let’s go see him,” said Annie.

“Are you nuts?” said Jack.

“Don’t you want to take notes about him?” asked Annie. “We’re probably the first people in the whole world to ever see a real live Triceratops.”

Jack sighed. She was right.

“Let’s go,” he said.

He shoved the dinosaur book into his pack. He slung it over his shoulder and started down the ladder.

On the way down, Jack stopped.

He called up to Annie, “Just promise you won’t pet him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t kiss him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t talk to him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t—”

“Go! Go!” she said.

Jack went.

Annie followed.

When they stepped off the ladder, the Pteranodon gave them a kind look.

Annie blew a kiss at him. “Be back soon, Henry,” she said cheerfully.

“Shush!” said Jack. And he led the way through the ferns. Slowly and carefully.

When he reached the bottom of the hill, he kneeled behind a fat bush.

Annie knelt beside him and started to speak.

“Shush!” Jack put his finger to his lips.

Annie made a face.

Jack peeked out at the Triceratops.

The dinosaur was incredibly big. Bigger than a truck. He was eating the flowers off a magnolia tree.

Jack slipped his notebook out of his pack. He wrote:



Annie nudged him.

Jack ignored her. He studied the Triceratops again. He wrote:



Annie nudged him hard.

Jack looked at her.

Annie pointed to herself. She walked her fingers through the air. She pointed to the dinosaur. She smiled.

Was she teasing?

She waved at Jack.

Jack started to grab her.

She laughed and jumped away. She fell into the grass. In full view of the Triceratops!

“Get back!” whispered Jack.

Too late. The big dinosaur had spotted Annie. He gazed down at her from the hilltop. Half of a magnolia flower was sticking out of his mouth.

“Oops,” said Annie.

“Get back!” Jack shouted at her.

“He looks nice, Jack.”

“Nice? Watch out for his horns, Annie!”

“No. He’s nice, Jack.”

Nice?

But the Triceratops just gazed calmly down at Annie. Then he turned and loped away. Down the side of the hill.

“Bye!” said Annie. She turned back to Jack. “See?”

Jack grunted. But he wrote in his notebook:





“Come on. Let’s look around some more,” said Annie.

As Jack started after Annie, he saw something glittering in the tall grass. He reached out and picked it up.



A medallion. A gold medallion.

A letter was engraved on the medallion. A fancy M.

“Oh, man. Someone came here before us,” Jack said softly.



6. Dinosaur Valley

“Annie, look at this!” Jack called. “Look what I found!”

Annie had gone up to the hilltop.

She was busy picking a flower from the magnolia tree.

“Annie, look! A medallion!”

But Annie wasn’t paying attention to Jack. She was staring at something on the other side of the hill.

“Oh, wow!” she said.

“Annie!”

Clutching her magnolia flower, she took off down the hill.

“Annie, come back!” Jack shouted.

But Annie had disappeared.

“I’m going to kill her,” Jack muttered.

He stuffed the gold medallion into his jeans pocket.

Then he heard Annie shriek.

“Annie?”

Jack heard another sound as well. A deep, bellowing sound. Like a tuba.

“Jack! Come here!” Annie called.

“Annie!”

Jack grabbed his backpack and raced up the hill.

When he got to the top, he gasped.

The valley below was filled with nests. Big nests made out of mud. And the nests were filled with tiny dinosaurs!



Annie was crouching next to one of the nests. And standing over her was a gigantic duck-billed dinosaur!

“Don’t panic. Don’t move,” said Jack. He stepped slowly down the hill toward Annie.

The huge dinosaur was towering above Annie. Waving her arms. Making her tuba sound.

Jack stopped. He didn’t want to get too close.

He knelt on the ground. “Okay. Move toward me. Slowly,” he said.

Annie started to stand up.

“Don’t stand. Crawl,” said Jack.

Clutching her flower, Annie crawled toward Jack.

The duck-billed dinosaur followed her. Still bellowing.

Annie froze.

“Keep going,” Jack said softly.

Annie started crawling again.

Jack inched farther down the hill. Until he was just an arm’s distance from Annie.

He reached out—and grabbed her hand.

He pulled Annie toward him.

“Stay down,” he said. He crouched next to her. “Bow your head. Pretend to chew.”

“Chew?”

“Yes. I read that’s what you do if a mean dog comes at you.”

“She’s no dog, Jack,” said Annie.

“Just chew,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie both bowed their heads. And pretended to chew.

Soon the dinosaur grew quiet.

Jack raised his head.

“I don’t think she’s mad anymore,” he said.

“Thanks, Jack, for saving me,” said Annie.

“You have to use your brain,” said Jack. “You can’t just go running to a nest of babies. There’s always a mother nearby.”

Annie stood up.

“Annie!”

Too late.

Annie held out her magnolia flower to the dinosaur.

“I’m sorry I made you worry about your babies,” she said.

The dinosaur moved closer to Annie. She grabbed the flower from her. She reached for another.

“No more,” said Annie.

The dinosaur let out a sad tuba sound.

“But there are more flowers up there,” Annie said. She pointed to the top of the hill. “I’ll get you some.”

Annie hurried up the hill.

The dinosaur waddled after her.

Jack quickly examined the babies. Some were crawling out of their nests.

Where were the other mothers?

Jack took out the dinosaur book. He flipped through the pages.

He found a picture of some duck-billed dinosaurs. He read the caption:

The Anatosauruses lived in colonies. While a few mothers baby-sat the nests, others hunted for food.



So there must be more mothers close by.

“Hey, Jack!” Annie called.

Jack looked up. Annie was at the top of the hill. Feeding magnolia flowers to the giant Anatosaurus!

“She’s nice, too, Jack,” Annie said.

But suddenly the Anatosaurus made her terrible tuba sound. Annie crouched down and started to chew.

The dinosaur barged down the hill.



She seemed afraid of something.

Jack put the book down on top of his pack. He hurried up to Annie.



“I wonder why she ran away,” said Annie. “We were starting to be friends.”

Jack looked around. What he saw in the distance almost made him throw up.

An enormous ugly monster was coming across the plain.

He was walking on two big legs. And swinging a long, thick tail. And dangling two tiny arms.

He had a huge head. And his jaws were wide open.

Even from far away Jack could see his long, gleaming teeth.

“Tyrannosaurus rex!” whispered Jack.



7. Ready, Set, Go!

“Run, Annie! Run!” cried Jack. “To the tree house!”

They dashed down the hill together. Through the tall grass, through the ferns, past the Pteranodon, and right to the rope ladder.

They scrambled up. Seconds later they tumbled into the tree house.

Annie leaped to the window.

“He’s going away!” she said, panting.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He looked through the window with her.

The Tyrannosaurus was wandering off.

But then the monster stopped and turned around.

“Duck!” said Jack.

The two of them hunched down.

After a long moment, they raised their heads. They peeked out again.

“Coast clear,” said Jack.

“Yay,” whispered Annie.

“We have to get out of here,” said Jack.

“You made a wish before,” said Annie.

“I wish we could go back to Frog Creek,” said Jack.

Nothing happened.

“I wish—”

“Wait. You were looking at a picture in the dinosaur book. Remember?”

The dinosaur book.

Jack groaned. “Oh, no. I left the book and my pack on the hill. I have to go back.”

“Oh, forget it,” said Annie.

“I can’t,” said Jack. “The book doesn’t belong to us. Plus my notebook’s in my pack. With all my notes.”

“Hurry!” said Annie.

Jack hurried down the rope ladder.

He leaped to the ground.

He raced past the Pteranodon, through the ferns, through the tall grass, and up the hill.

He looked down.

There was his pack, lying on the ground. On top of it was the dinosaur book.

But now the valley below was filled with Anatosauruses. All standing guard around the nests.

Where had they been? Did fear of the Tyrannosaurus send them home?

Jack took a deep breath.

Ready! Set! Go!

He charged down the hill. He leaped to his backpack. He scooped it up. He grabbed the dinosaur book.

A terrible tuba sound! Another! Another! All the Anatosauruses were bellowing at him.

Jack took off.

He raced up to the hilltop.

He started down the hill.

He stopped.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was back! And he was standing between Jack and the tree house!



8. A Giant Shadow

Jack jumped behind the magnolia tree.

His heart was beating so fast he could hardly think.

He peeked out at the giant monster. The horrible-looking creature was opening and closing his huge jaws. His teeth were as big as steak knives.

Don’t panic. Think.

Jack peered down at the valley.

Good. The duck-billed dinosaurs were sticking close to their nests.

Jack looked back at the Tyrannosaurus.

Good. The monster still didn’t seem to know he was there.

Don’t panic. Think. Think. Maybe there’s information in the book.

Jack opened the dinosaur book. He found Tyrannosaurus rex. He read:

Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest meat-eating land animal of all time. If it were alive today, it would eat a human in one bite.



Great. The book was no help at all.

Okay. He couldn’t hide on the other side of the hill. The Anatosauruses might stampede.

Okay. He couldn’t run to the tree house. The Tyrannosaurus might run faster.

Okay. Maybe he should just wait. Wait for the monster to leave.

Jack peeked around the tree.

The Tyrannosaurus had wandered closer to the hill.



Something caught Jack’s eye. Annie was coming down the rope ladder!

Was she nuts? What was she doing?

Jack watched Annie hop off the ladder.

She went straight to the Pteranodon. She was talking to him. She was flapping her arms. She pointed at Jack, at the sky, at the tree house.

She was nuts!

“Go! Go back up the tree!” Jack whispered. “Go!”

Suddenly Jack heard a roar.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was looking in his direction.

Jack hit the ground.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was coming toward the hill.

Jack felt the ground shaking.

Should he run? Crawl back into Dinosaur Valley? Climb the magnolia tree?

Just then a giant shadow covered Jack. He looked up.

The Pteranodon was gliding overhead. The giant creature sailed down toward the top of the hill.

He was coming straight for Jack.



9. The Amazing Ride

The Pteranodon coasted down to the ground.

He stared at Jack with his bright, alert eyes.

What was Jack supposed to do? Climb on? “But I’m too heavy,” thought Jack.

Don’t think. Just do it.

Jack looked at the Tyrannosaurus.

He was starting up the hill. His giant teeth were flashing in the sunlight.

Okay. Don’t think. Just do it!

Jack put his book in his pack. Then he eased down onto the Pteranodon’s back.

He held on tightly.

The creature moved forward. He spread out his wings—and lifted off the ground!

They teetered this way. Then that.

Jack nearly fell off.

The Pteranodon steadied himself, then rose into the sky.

Jack looked down. The Tyrannosaurus was chomping the air and staring up at him.

The Pteranodon glided away.

He sailed over the hilltop.

He circled over the valley. Over all the nests filled with babies. Over all the giant duck-billed dinosaurs.

Then the Pteranodon soared out over the plain—over the Triceratops who was grazing in the high grass.

It was amazing! It was a miracle!

Jack felt like a bird. As light as a feather.



The wind was rushing through his hair. The air smelled sweet and fresh.

He whooped. He laughed.

Jack couldn’t believe it. He was riding on the back of an ancient flying reptile!

The Pteranodon sailed over the stream, over the ferns and bushes.

Then he carried Jack down to the base of the oak tree.

When they came to a stop, Jack slid off the creature’s back. And landed on the ground.

Then the Pteranodon took off again and glided into the sky.

“Bye, Henry,” whispered Jack.

“Are you okay?” Annie shouted from the tree house.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He kept staring up at the Pteranodon.

“Jack, are you okay?” Annie called.

Jack looked up at Annie. He smiled.

“Thanks for saving my life,” he said. “That was really fun.”

“Climb up!” said Annie.

Jack tried to stand. His legs were wobbly.

He felt a bit dizzy.

“Hurry!” shouted Annie. “He’s coming!”

Jack looked around. The Tyrannosaurus was heading straight toward him!

Jack bolted to the ladder. He grabbed the sides and started up.

“Hurry! Hurry!” screamed Annie.

Jack scrambled into the tree house.

“He’s coming toward the tree!” Annie cried.

Suddenly something slammed against the oak tree. The tree house shook like a leaf.

Jack and Annie tumbled into the books.

“Make a wish!” cried Annie.

“We need the book! The one with the picture of Frog Creek!” said Jack. “Where is it?”

He pushed some books aside. He had to find that book about Pennsylvania.

There it was!

He grabbed it and tore through it, looking for the photograph of the Frog Creek woods.

He found it! Jack pointed to the picture.

“I wish we could go home!” he shouted.

The wind began to moan. Softly at first.

“Hurry!” Jack yelled.

The wind picked up. It was whistling now.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Jack closed his eyes. He held on tightly to Annie.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Home Before Dark

A bird began to sing.

Jack opened his eyes. He was still pointing at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

He peeked out the tree house window. Outside he saw the exact same view.

“We’re home,” whispered Annie.

The woods were lit with a golden late-afternoon light. The sun was about to set.

No time had passed since they’d left.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” a voice called from the distance.

“That’s Mom,” said Annie, pointing.



Jack saw their mother far away. She was standing in front of their house. She looked very tiny.

“An-nie! Ja-ack!” she called.

Annie stuck her head out the window and shouted, “Come-ing!”

Jack still felt dazed. He just stared at Annie.

“What happened to us?” he said.

“We took a trip in a magic tree house,” said Annie simply.

“But it’s the same time as when we left,” said Jack.

Annie shrugged.

“And how did it take us so far away?” said Jack. “And so long ago?”

“You just looked at a book and said you wished we could go there,” said Annie. “And the magic tree house took us there.”

“But how?” said Jack. “And who built this magic tree house? Who put all these books here?”

“A magic person, I guess,” said Annie.

A magic person?

“Oh, look,” said Jack. “I almost forgot about this.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the gold medallion. “Someone lost this back there … in dinosaur land. Look, there’s a letter M on it.”

Annie’s eyes got round. “You think M stands for magic person?” she said.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I just know someone went to that place before us.”

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” came the distant cry again.

Annie poked her head out the window. “Come-ing!” she shouted.

Jack put the gold medallion back in his pocket.

He pulled the dinosaur book out of his pack. And put it back with all the other books.

Then he and Annie took one last look around the tree house.

“Good-bye, house,” whispered Annie.

Jack slung his backpack over his shoulder. He pointed at the ladder.

Annie started down. Jack followed.

Seconds later they hopped onto the ground and started walking out of the woods.

“No one’s going to believe our story,” said Jack.



“So let’s not tell anyone,” said Annie.

“Dad won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“He’ll say it was a dream,” said Annie.

“Mom won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“She’ll say it was pretend.”

“My teacher won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“She’ll say you’re nuts,” said Annie.

“We better not tell anyone,” said Jack.

“I already said that,” said Annie.

Jack sighed. “I think I’m starting to not believe it myself,” he said.

They left the woods and started up the road toward their house.

As they walked past all the houses on their street, the trip to dinosaur time did seem more and more like a dream.

Only this world and this time seemed real.

Jack reached into his pocket. He clasped the gold medallion.

He felt the engraving of the letter M. It made Jack’s fingers tingle.

Jack laughed. Suddenly he felt very happy.

He couldn’t explain what had happened today. But he knew for sure that their trip in the magic tree house had been real.

Absolutely real.

“Tomorrow,” Jack said softly, “we’ll go back to the woods.”

“Of course,” said Annie.

“And we’ll climb up to the tree house,” said Jack.

“Of course,” said Annie.

“And we’ll see what happens next,” said Jack.

“Of course,” said Annie. “Race you!”

And they took off together, running for home.

Jack couldn’t sleep.

He put his glasses on. He looked at the clock. 5:30.

Too early to get up.

Yesterday so many strange things had happened. Now he was trying to figure them out.

He turned on the light. He picked up his notebook. He looked at the list he’d made before going to bed.



Jack pushed his glasses into place. Who was going to believe any of this?

Not his mom. Or his dad. Or his third-grade teacher, Ms. Watkins. Only his seven-year-old sister, Annie. She’d gone with him to the time of the dinosaurs.

“Can’t you sleep?”

It was Annie, standing in his doorway.

“Nope,” said Jack.

“Me neither,” said Annie. “What are you doing?”

She walked over to Jack and looked at his notebook. She read the list.

“Aren’t you going to write about the gold medal?” she asked.

“You mean the gold medallion,” said Jack.

He picked up his pencil and wrote:



“Aren’t you going to put the letter M on the medal?” said Annie.

“Medallion,” said Jack. “Not medal.”

He added an M:



“Aren’t you going to write about the magic person?” said Annie.

“We don’t know for sure if there is a magic person,” said Jack.

“Well, someone built the tree house in the woods. Someone put the books in it. Someone lost a gold medal in dinosaur time.”

“Medallion!” said Jack for the third time. “And I’m just writing the facts. The stuff we know for sure.”

“Let’s go back to the tree house right now,” said Annie. “And find out if the magic person is a fact.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “The sun’s not even up yet.”

“Come on,” said Annie. “Maybe we can catch them sleeping.”

“I don’t think we should,” said Jack. He was worried. What if the “magic person” was mean? What if he or she didn’t want kids to know about the tree house?

“Well, I’m going,” said Annie.

Jack looked out his window at the dark-gray sky. It was almost dawn.

He sighed. “Okay. Let’s get dressed. I’ll meet you at the back door. Be quiet.”

“Yay!” whispered Annie. She tiptoed away as quietly as a mouse.

Jack put on jeans, a warm sweatshirt, and sneakers. He tossed his notebook and pencil in his backpack.

He crept downstairs.

Annie was waiting by the back door. She shined a flashlight in Jack’s face. “Ta-da! A magic wand!” she said.

“Shhh! Don’t wake up Mom and Dad,” whispered Jack. “And turn that flashlight off. We don’t want anyone to see us.”

Annie nodded and turned it off. Then she clipped it onto her belt.

They slipped out the door into the cool early-morning air. Crickets were chirping. The dog next door barked.

“Quiet, Henry!” whispered Annie.

Henry stopped barking. Animals always seemed to do what Annie said.

“Let’s run!” said Jack.

They dashed across the dark, wet lawn and didn’t stop until they reached the woods.

“We need the flashlight now,” said Jack.

Annie took it off her belt and switched it on.

Step by step, she and Jack walked between the trees. Jack held his breath. The dark woods were scary.

“Gotcha!” said Annie, shining the flashlight in Jack’s face.

Jack jumped back. Then he frowned.

“Cut it out!” he said.

“I scared you,” said Annie.

Jack glared at her.

“Stop pretending!” he whispered. “This is serious.”

“Okay, okay.”

Annie shined her flashlight over the tops of the trees.

“Now what are you doing?” said Jack.

“Looking for the tree house!”

The light stopped moving.

There it was. The mysterious tree house. At the top of the tallest tree in the woods.

Annie shined her light at the tree house, and then down the tall ladder. All the way to the ground.

“I’m going up,” she said. She gripped the flashlight and began to climb.



“Wait!” Jack called.

What if someone was in the tree house?

“Annie! Come back!”

But she was gone. The light disappeared. Jack was alone in the dark.

1. The Dark Woods

Too early to get up.

He turned on the light. He picked up his notebook. He looked at the list he’d made before going to bed.

Not his mom. Or his dad. Or his third-grade teacher, Ms. Watkins. Only his seven-year-old sister, Annie. She’d gone with him to the time of the dinosaurs.

“Can’t you sleep?”

It was Annie, standing in his doorway.

“Nope,” said Jack.

“Me neither,” said Annie. “What are you doing?”

She walked over to Jack and looked at his notebook. She read the list.

“Aren’t you going to write about the gold medal?” she asked.

“You mean the gold medallion,” said Jack.

He picked up his pencil and wrote:



“Aren’t you going to put the letter M on the medal?” said Annie.

“Medallion,” said Jack. “Not medal.”

He added an M:



“Aren’t you going to write about the magic person?” said Annie.

“We don’t know for sure if there is a magic person,” said Jack.

“Well, someone built the tree house in the woods. Someone put the books in it. Someone lost a gold medal in dinosaur time.”

“Medallion!” said Jack for the third time. “And I’m just writing the facts. The stuff we know for sure.”

“Let’s go back to the tree house right now,” said Annie. “And find out if the magic person is a fact.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “The sun’s not even up yet.”

“Come on,” said Annie. “Maybe we can catch them sleeping.”

“I don’t think we should,” said Jack. He was worried. What if the “magic person” was mean? What if he or she didn’t want kids to know about the tree house?

“Well, I’m going,” said Annie.

Jack looked out his window at the dark-gray sky. It was almost dawn.

He sighed. “Okay. Let’s get dressed. I’ll meet you at the back door. Be quiet.”

“Yay!” whispered Annie. She tiptoed away as quietly as a mouse.

Jack put on jeans, a warm sweatshirt, and sneakers. He tossed his notebook and pencil in his backpack.

He crept downstairs.

Annie was waiting by the back door. She shined a flashlight in Jack’s face. “Ta-da! A magic wand!” she said.

“Shhh! Don’t wake up Mom and Dad,” whispered Jack. “And turn that flashlight off. We don’t want anyone to see us.”

Annie nodded and turned it off. Then she clipped it onto her belt.

They slipped out the door into the cool early-morning air. Crickets were chirping. The dog next door barked.

“Quiet, Henry!” whispered Annie.

Henry stopped barking. Animals always seemed to do what Annie said.

“Let’s run!” said Jack.

They dashed across the dark, wet lawn and didn’t stop until they reached the woods.

“We need the flashlight now,” said Jack.

Annie took it off her belt and switched it on.

Step by step, she and Jack walked between the trees. Jack held his breath. The dark woods were scary.

“Gotcha!” said Annie, shining the flashlight in Jack’s face.

Jack jumped back. Then he frowned.

“Cut it out!” he said.

“I scared you,” said Annie.

Jack glared at her.

“Stop pretending!” he whispered. “This is serious.”

“Okay, okay.”

Annie shined her flashlight over the tops of the trees.

“Now what are you doing?” said Jack.

“Looking for the tree house!”

The light stopped moving.

There it was. The mysterious tree house. At the top of the tallest tree in the woods.

Annie shined her light at the tree house, and then down the tall ladder. All the way to the ground.

“I’m going up,” she said. She gripped the flashlight and began to climb.



“Wait!” Jack called.

What if someone was in the tree house?

“Annie! Come back!”

But she was gone. The light disappeared. Jack was alone in the dark.



2. Leaving Again

“No one’s here!” Annie shouted down.

Jack thought about going home. Then he thought about all the books in the tree house.

He started up the ladder. When he was nearly to the tree house, he saw light in the distant sky. Dawn was starting to break.

He crawled through a hole in the floor and took off his backpack.

It was dark inside the tree house.

Annie was shining her flashlight on the books scattered about.

“They’re still here,” she said.

She stopped the light on a dinosaur book. It was the book that had taken them to the time of the dinosaurs.

“Remember the Tyrannosaurus?” asked Annie.

Jack shuddered. Of course he remembered! How could anyone forget seeing a real live Tyrannosaurus rex?

The light fell on a book about Pennsylvania. A red silk bookmark stuck out of it.

“Remember the picture of Frog Creek?” said Annie.

“Of course,” said Jack. That was the picture that had brought them home.

“There’s my favorite,” said Annie.

The light was shining on a book about knights and castles. There was a blue leather bookmark in it.

Annie turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a knight on a black horse. He was riding toward a castle.

“Annie, close that book,” said Jack. “I know what you’re thinking.”

Annie pointed at the knight.

“Don’t, Annie!”

“We wish we could see this guy for real,” Annie said.

“No, we don’t!” shouted Jack.

They heard a strange sound.

“Neeee-hhhh!”

It sounded like a horse neighing.

They both went to the window.

Annie shined the flashlight down on the ground.

“Oh no,” whispered Jack.

“A knight!” said Annie.

A knight in shining armor! Riding a black horse! Through the Frog Creek woods!

Then the wind began to moan. The leaves began to tremble.

It was happening again.

“We’re leaving!” cried Annie. “Get down!”

The wind moaned louder. The leaves shook harder.

And the tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes. He shivered. The air was damp and cool.

The sound of a horse’s whinny came again from below.

“Neeee-hhhh!”

“I think we’re here,” whispered Annie. She was still holding the castle book.

Jack peeked out the window.

A huge castle loomed out of the fog.

He looked around. The tree house was in a different oak tree. And down below, the knight on the black horse was riding by.

“We can’t stay here,” said Jack. “We have to go home and make a plan first.” He picked up the book about Pennsylvania. He opened it to the page with the red silk bookmark. He pointed to the photograph of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish—”

“No!” said Annie. She yanked the book away from him. “Let’s stay! I want to visit the castle!”

“You’re nuts. We have to examine the situation,” said Jack. “From home.”

“Let’s examine it here!” said Annie.

“Come on.” He held out his hand. “Give it.”

Annie gave Jack the book. “Okay. You can go home. I’m staying,” she said. She clipped the flashlight to her belt.





“Wait!” said Jack.

“I’m going to take a peek. A teeny peek,” she said. And she scooted down the ladder.

Jack groaned. Okay, she had won. He couldn’t leave without her. Besides, he sort of wanted to take a peek himself.

He put down the book about Pennsylvania.

He dropped the castle book into his pack. He stepped onto the ladder. And headed down into the cool, misty air.



3. Across the Bridge

Annie was under the tree, looking across the foggy ground.

“The knight’s riding toward that bridge, I think,” said Annie. “The bridge goes to the castle.”

“Wait. I’ll look it up,” said Jack. “Give me the flashlight!”

He took the flashlight from her and pulled the castle book out of his pack. He opened it to the page with the leather bookmark.

He read the words under the picture of the knight:

This is a knight arriving for a castle feast. Knights wore armor when they traveled long and dangerous distances. The armor was very heavy. A helmet alone could weigh up to forty pounds.



Wow. Jack had weighed forty pounds when he was five years old. So it’d be like riding a horse with a five-year-old on your head.

Jack pulled out his notebook. He wanted to take notes, as he’d done on their dinosaur trip.

He wrote:



What else?

He turned the pages of the castle book. He found a picture that showed the whole castle and the buildings around it.

“The knight’s crossing the bridge,” said Annie. “He’s going through the gate .… He’s gone.”

Jack studied the bridge in the picture.

He read:

A drawbridge crossed the moat. The moat was filled with water, to help protect the castle from enemies. Some people believe crocodiles were kept in the moat.



Jack wrote in his notebook:



“Look!” said Annie, peering through the mist. “A windmill! Right over there!”



“Yeah, there’s a windmill in here, too,” said Jack, pointing at the picture.

“Look at the real one, Jack,” said Annie. “Not the one in the book.”

A piercing shriek split the air.

“Yikes,” said Annie. “It sounded like it came from that little house over there!” She pointed through the fog.

“There’s a little house here,” said Jack, studying the picture. He turned the page and read:

The hawk house was in the inner ward of the castle. Hawks were trained to hunt other birds and small animals.



Jack wrote in his notebook:



“We must be in the inner ward,” said Jack.

“Listen!” whispered Annie. “You hear that? Drums! Horns! They’re coming from the castle. Let’s go see.”

“Wait,” said Jack. He turned more pages of the book.

“I want to see what’s really going on, Jack. Not what’s in the book,” said Annie.

“But look at this!” said Jack.

He pointed to a picture of a big party. Men were standing by the door, playing drums and horns.

He read:

Fanfares were played to announce different dishes in a feast. Feasts were held in the Great Hall.



“You can look at the book. I’m going to the real feast,” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack, studying the picture. It showed boys his age carrying trays of food. Whole pigs. Pies. Peacocks with all their feathers. Peacocks?

Jack wrote:



He held up the book to show Annie. “Look, I think they eat—”

Where was she? Gone. Again.

Jack looked through the fog.

He heard the real drums and the real horns. He saw the real hawk house, the real windmill, the real moat.

He saw Annie dashing across the real drawbridge. Then she vanished through the gate leading to the castle.



4. Into the Castle

“I’m going to kill her,” muttered Jack.

He threw his stuff into his pack and moved toward the drawbridge. He hoped no one would see him.

It was getting darker. It must be night.

When he got to the bridge, he started across. The wooden planks creaked under his feet.

He peered over the edge of the bridge. Were there any crocodiles in the moat? He couldn’t tell.

“Halt!” someone shouted. A guard on top of the castle wall was looking down.

Jack dashed across the bridge. He ran through the castle gate and into the courtyard.

From inside the castle came the sounds of music, shouting, and laughter.

Jack hurried to a dark corner and crouched down. He shivered as he looked around for Annie.

Torches lit the high wall around the courtyard. The courtyard was nearly empty.

Two boys led horses that clopped over the gray cobblestones.

“Neeee-hhhh!”

Jack turned. It was the knight’s black horse!

“Psssst!”

He peered into the darkness.

There was Annie.

She was hiding behind a well in the center of the courtyard. She waved at him.

Jack waved back. He waited till the boys and horses disappeared inside the stable. Then he dashed to the well.

“I’m going to find the music!” whispered Annie. “Are you coming?”

“Okay,” Jack said with a sigh.

They tiptoed together across the cobblestones. Then they slipped into the entrance of the castle.

Noise and music came from a bright room in front of them. They stood on one side of the doorway and peeked in.

“The feast in the Great Hall!” whispered Jack. He held his breath as he stared in awe.

A giant fireplace blazed at one end of the noisy room. Antlers and rugs hung on the stone walls. Flowers covered the floor. Boys in short dresses carried huge trays of food.

Dogs were fighting over bones under the tables.

People in bright clothes and funny hats strolled among the crowd. Some played funny-shaped guitars. Some tossed balls in the air. Some balanced swords on their hands.

Men and women dressed in capes and furs sat at long, crowded wooden tables.

“I wonder which one is the knight,” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” whispered Annie. “But they’re eating with their fingers.”

Suddenly, someone shouted behind them.



Jack whirled around.

A man carrying a tray of pies was standing a few feet away.

“Who art thou?” he asked angrily.

“Jack,” squeaked Jack.

“Annie,” squeaked Annie.

Then they ran as fast as they could down a dimly lit hallway.



5. Trapped

“Come on!” cried Annie.

Jack raced behind her.

Were they being followed?

“Here! Quick!” Annie dashed toward a door off the hallway. She pushed the door open. The two of them stumbled into a dark, cold room. The door creaked shut behind them.

“Give me the flashlight,” said Annie. Jack handed it to her, and she switched it on.

Yikes! A row of knights right in front of them!



Annie flicked off the light.

Silence.

“They aren’t moving,” Jack whispered.

Annie turned the light back on.

“They’re just suits,” Jack said.

“Without heads,” said Annie.

“Let me have the flashlight a second,” said Jack. “So I can look in the book.”

Annie handed him the flashlight. He pulled out the castle book. He flipped through the pages until he found what he was looking for.

Jack put the book away. “It’s called the armory,” he said. “It’s where armor and weapons are stored.”

He shined the flashlight around the room.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

The light fell on shiny breastplates, leg plates, arm plates. On shelves filled with helmets and weapons. On shields, spears, swords, crossbows, clubs, battle-axes.

There was a noise in the hall. Voices!

“Let’s hide!” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I’ve got to check on something first.”

“Hurry,” said Annie.

“It’ll take just a second,” said Jack. “Hold this.” He handed Annie the flashlight.

He tried to lift a helmet from a shelf. It was too heavy.

He bent over and dragged the helmet over his head. The visor slammed shut.

Oh, forget it. It was worse than having a five-year-old on your head. More like having a ten-year-old on your head.

Not only could Jack not lift his head, he couldn’t see anything, either.

“Jack!” Annie’s voice sounded far away. “The voices are getting closer!”

“Turn off the flashlight!” Jack’s voice echoed inside the metal chamber.

He struggled to get the helmet off.

Suddenly he lost his balance and went crashing into other pieces of armor.

The metal plates and weapons clattered to the floor.

Jack lay on the floor in the dark.

He tried to get up. But his head was too heavy.

He heard deep voices.

Someone grabbed him by the arm. The next thing he knew, his helmet was yanked off. He was staring into the blazing light of a fiery torch.



6. Ta-da!

In the torchlight, Jack saw three huge men standing over him.

One with very squinty eyes held the torch. One with a very red face held Jack. And one with a very long mustache held on to Annie.

Annie was kicking and yelling.

“Stop!” said the one with the very long mustache.

“Who art thou?” said the one with the very red face.

“Spies? Foreigners? Egyptians? Romans? Persians?” said the squinty-eyed one.

“No, you dummies!” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” Jack muttered.

“Arrest them!” said Red-face.

“The dungeon!” said Squinty-eyes.

The guards marched Jack and Annie out of the armory. Jack looked back frantically. Where was his backpack?

“Go!” said a guard, giving him a push.

Jack went.

Down they marched, down the long, dark hallway. Squinty, Annie, Mustache, Jack, and Red.

Down a narrow, winding staircase.

Jack heard Annie shouting at the guards. “Dummies! Meanies! We didn’t do anything!”

The guards laughed. They didn’t take her seriously at all.

At the bottom of the stairs was a big iron door with a bar across it.

Squinty pushed the bar off the door. Then he shoved at the door. It creaked open.

Jack and Annie were pushed into a cold, clammy room.

The fiery torch lit the dungeon. There were chains hanging from the filthy walls. Water dripped from the ceiling, making puddles on the stone floor. It was the creepiest place Jack had ever seen.

“We’ll keep them here till the feast is done. Then turn them over to the Duke,” said Squinty. “He knows how to take care of thieves.”

“There will be a hanging tomorrow,” said Mustache.

“If the rats don’t get them first,” said Red.

They all laughed.

Jack saw that Annie had his backpack. She was quietly unzipping it.

“Come on, let’s chain the two of ’em,” said Squinty.

The guards started toward them. Annie whipped her flashlight out of the pack.

“Ta-da!” she yelled.

The guards froze. They stared at the shiny flashlight in her hand.

Annie switched the light on. The guards gasped in fear. They jumped back against the wall.

Squinty dropped the torch. It fell into a dirty puddle on the floor, sputtered, and went out.

“My magic wand!” Annie said, waving the flashlight. “Get down. Or I’ll wipe you out!”

Jack’s mouth dropped open.

Annie fiercely pointed her light at one, then the other. Each howled and covered his face.



“Down! All of you! Get down!” shouted Annie.

One by one, the guards lay down on the wet floor.

Jack couldn’t believe it.

“Come on,” Annie said to him. “Let’s go.”

Jack looked at the open doorway. He looked at the guards quaking on the ground.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

In one quick leap, Jack followed her out of the terrible dungeon.




7. A Secret Passage

Annie and Jack raced back up the winding stairs and down the long hallway.

They hadn’t gone far when they heard shouting behind them.

Dogs barked in the distance.

“They’re coming!” Annie cried.

“In here!” said Jack. He shoved open a door off the hallway and pulled Annie into a dark room.

Jack pushed the door shut. Then Annie shined her flashlight around the room. There were rows of sacks and wooden barrels.

“I’d better look in the book,” said Jack. “Give it to me!”

Annie gave him the flashlight and his backpack. He pulled out the book and started tearing through it.

“Shhh!” said Annie. “Someone’s coming.”

Jack and Annie jumped behind the door as it creaked open.

Jack held his breath. A light from a torch danced wildly over the sacks and barrels.

The light disappeared. The door slammed shut.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We have to hurry. They might come back.”

His hands were trembling as he flipped through the pages of the castle book.

“Here’s a map of the castle,” he said. “Look, this must be the room we’re in. It’s a storeroom.” Jack studied the room in the book. “These are sacks of flour and barrels of wine.”

“Who cares? We have to go!” said Annie. “Before they come back!”

“No. Look,” said Jack. He pointed at the map. “Here’s a trapdoor.”

He read aloud:

This door leads from the storeroom through a secret passage to a precipice over the moat.



“What’s a precipice?” said Annie.

“I don’t know. We’ll find out,” said Jack. “But first we have to find the door.”

Jack looked at the picture carefully. Then he shined the flashlight around the room.

The floor of the room was made up of stones. The trapdoor in the picture was five stones away from the door to the hall.

Jack shined the light on the floor and counted the stones. “One, two, three, four, five.”

He stamped on the fifth stone. It was loose!

He put the flashlight on the floor. He worked his fingers under the thin sheet of stone and tried to lift it.

“Help,” Jack said.

Annie came over and helped him lift the stone square out of its place. Underneath was a small wooden door.

Jack and Annie tugged on the rope handle of the door. The door fell open with a thunk.

Jack picked up the flashlight and shined it on the hole.

“There’s a little ladder,” he said. “Let’s go!”

He clipped on the flashlight and felt his way down the small ladder. Annie followed.

When they both reached the bottom of the ladder, Jack shined the light around them.

There was a tunnel!

He crouched down and began moving through the damp, creepy tunnel. The flashlight barely lit the stone walls.

He shook the light. Were the batteries running down?

“I think our light’s dying!” he said to Annie.

“Hurry!” she called from behind.

Jack went faster. His back hurt from crouching.

The light got dimmer and dimmer.

He was desperate to get out of the castle before the batteries died completely.

Soon he reached another small wooden door. The door at the end of the tunnel!

Jack unlatched the door and pushed it open.

He poked his head outside.

He couldn’t see anything in the misty darkness.

The air felt good. Cool and fresh. He took a deep breath.

“Where are we?” whispered Annie behind him. “What do you see?”

“Nothing. But I think we’ve come to the outside of the castle,” said Jack. “I’ll find out.”

Jack put the flashlight in his pack. He put the pack on his back. He stuck his hand out the door. He couldn’t feel the ground. Just air.

“I’m going to have to go feet first,” he said.

Jack turned around in the small tunnel. He lay down on his stomach. He stuck one leg out the door. Then the other.

Jack inched down, bit by bit. Until he was hanging out the door, clinging to the ledge.

“This must be the precipice!” he called to Annie. “Pull me up!”

Annie reached for Jack’s hands. “I can’t hold you!” she said.



Jack felt his fingers slipping. Then down he fell.

Down through the darkness.

SPLASH!



8. The Knight

Water filled Jack’s nose and covered his head. His glasses fell off. He grabbed them just in time. He coughed and flailed his arms.

“Jack!” Annie was calling from above.

“I’m in … the moat!” said Jack, gasping for air. He tried to tread water and put his glasses back on. With his backpack, his shoes, and his heavy clothes, he could hardly stay afloat.

SPLASH!

“Hi! I’m here!” Annie sputtered.

Jack could hear her nearby. But he couldn’t see her.

“Which way’s land?” Annie asked.

“I don’t know! Just swim!”

Jack dog-paddled through the cold black water.

He heard Annie swimming, too. At first it seemed as if she was swimming in front of him. But then he heard a splash behind him.

“Annie?” he called.

“What?” Her voice came from in front. Not behind.

Another splash. Behind.

Jack’s heart almost stopped. Crocodiles? He couldn’t see anything through his water-streaked glasses.

“Annie!” he whispered.

“What?”

“Swim faster!”

“But I’m here! I’m over here! Near the edge!” she whispered.

Jack swam through the dark toward her voice. He imagined a crocodile slithering after him.

Another splash! Not far away!

Jack’s hand touched a wet, live thing.

“Ahhhh!” he cried.

“It’s me! Take my hand!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed her hand. She pulled him to the edge of the moat. They crawled over an embankment onto the wet grass.

Safe!

Another splash came from the moat waters.

“Oh, man,” Jack said.

He was shivering all over. His teeth were chattering. He shook the water off his glasses and put them back on.

It was so misty he couldn’t see the castle. He couldn’t even see the moat, much less a crocodile.

“We … we made it,” said Annie. Her teeth were chattering, too.

“I know,” said Jack. “But where are we?” He peered at the foggy darkness.

Where was the drawbridge? The windmill? The hawk house? The grove of trees? The tree house?

Everything had been swallowed up by the thick, soupy darkness.

Jack reached into his wet backpack and pulled out the flashlight. He pushed the switch. No more light.

They were trapped. Not in a dungeon. But in the still, cold darkness.

“Neeee-hhhh!”

A horse’s whinny.



Just then the clouds parted. A full moon was shining in the sky. A pool of light spread through the mist.

Then Jack and Annie saw him just a few feet away. The knight.

He sat on the black horse. His armor shone in the moonlight. A visor hid his face. But he seemed to be staring straight at Jack and Annie.



9. Under the Moon


Jack froze.

“It’s him,” Annie whispered.

The knight held out his gloved hand.

“Come on, Jack,” Annie said.

“Where are you going?” said Jack.

“He wants to help us,” said Annie.

“How do you know?”

“I can just tell,” said Annie.

Annie stepped toward the horse. The knight dismounted.

The knight picked Annie up and put her on the back of his horse.

“Come on, Jack,” she called.

Jack moved slowly toward the knight. It was like a dream.

The knight picked him up, too. He placed Jack on the horse, behind Annie.

The knight got on behind them. He slapped the reins.

The black horse cantered beside the moonlit water of the moat.

Jack rocked back and forth in the saddle. The wind blew his hair. He felt very brave and very powerful.

He felt as if he could ride forever on this horse, with this mysterious knight. Over the ocean. Over the world. Over the moon.

A hawk shrieked in the darkness.

“There’s the tree house,” said Annie. She pointed toward a grove of trees.



The knight steered the horse toward the trees.

“See. There it is,” Annie said, pointing to the ladder.

The knight brought his horse to a stop. He dismounted and helped Annie down.

“Thank you, sir,” she said. And she bowed.

Then Jack. “Thank you,” he said. And he bowed also.

The knight got back on his horse. He raised his gloved hand. Then he slapped the reins and rode off through the mist.

Annie started up the tall ladder, and Jack followed. They climbed into the dark tree house and looked out the window.

The knight was riding toward the outer wall. They saw him go through the outer gate.

Clouds started to cover the moon again. For a brief moment, Jack thought he saw the knight’s armor gleaming on the top of a hill beyond the castle.

The clouds covered the moon completely. And a black mist swallowed the land.

“He’s gone,” whispered Annie.

Jack shivered in his wet clothes as he kept staring at the blackness.

“I’m cold,” said Annie. “Where’s the Pennsylvania book?”

Jack heard Annie fumble in the darkness. He kept looking out the window.

“I think this is it,” said Annie. “I feel a silk bookmark.”

Jack was only half-listening. He was hoping to see the knight’s armor gleam again in the distance.

“Okay. I’m going to use this,” said Annie. “Because I think it’s the right one. Here goes. Okay. I’m pointing. I’m going to wish. I wish we could go to Frog Creek!”

Jack heard the wind begin to blow. Softly at first.

“I hope I pointed to the right picture in the right book,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked back at her. “Right picture? Right book?”

The tree house began to rock. The wind got louder and louder.

“I hope it wasn’t the dinosaur book!” said Annie.

“Stop!” Jack shouted at the tree house.

Too late.

The tree house started to spin. It was spinning and spinning!

The wind was screaming.

Then suddenly there was silence.

Absolute silence.



10. One Mystery Solved


The air was warm.

It was dawn. Far away a dog barked.

“I think that’s Henry barking!” Annie said. “We did come home.”

They both looked out the tree house window.

“That was close,” said Jack.

In the distance, streetlights lit their street. There was a light on in their upstairs window.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “I think Mom and Dad are up. Hurry!”

“Wait.” In a daze, Jack unzipped his backpack. He pulled out the castle book. It was quite wet. But Jack placed it back with all the other books.

“Come on! Hurry!” said Annie, scooting out of the tree house.

Jack followed her down the ladder.

They reached the ground and took off between the gray-black trees.

They left the woods and ran down their deserted street.

They got to their yard and crept across the lawn. Right up to the back door.

Jack and Annie slipped inside the house.

“They’re not downstairs yet,” whispered Annie.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

He led the way up the stairs and down the hall. No sign of his mom or dad. But he could hear water running in the bathroom.

Their house was so different from the dark, cold castle. So safe and cozy and friendly.

Annie stopped at her bedroom door. She gave Jack a smile, then disappeared inside her room.

Jack hurried into his room. He took off his damp clothes and pulled on his dry, soft pajamas.

He sat down on his bed and unzipped his backpack. He took out his wet notebook. He felt around for the pencil, but his hand touched something else.

Jack pulled the blue leather bookmark out of his pack. It must have fallen out of the castle book.

Jack held the bookmark close to his lamp and studied it. The leather was smooth and worn. It seemed ancient.

For the first time Jack noticed a letter on the bookmark. A fancy M.

Jack opened the drawer next to his bed. He took out the gold medallion.

He looked at the letter on it. It was the same M.

Now this was an amazing new fact.

Jack took a deep breath. One mystery solved.

The person who had dropped the gold medallion in the time of the dinosaurs was the same person who owned all the books in the tree house.

Who was this person?

Jack placed the bookmark next to the medallion. He closed the drawer.

He picked up his pencil. He turned to the least wet page in his notebook. And he started to write down this new fact.



But before he could draw the M, his eyes closed.

He dreamed they were with the knight again. All three of them riding the black horse through the cool, dark night. Beyond the outer wall of the castle. And up over a moonlit hill.

Into the mist.

“It’s still here,” said Jack.

“It looks empty,” said Annie.

Jack and his seven-year-old sister gazed up at a very tall oak tree. At the top of the tree was a tree house.

Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. It was almost time for lunch.

“Shhh!” said Jack. “What was that noise?”

“What noise?”

“I heard a noise,” Jack said. He looked around. “It sounded like someone coughing.”

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Annie. “Come on. Let’s go up.”

She grabbed onto the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack tiptoed over to a clump of bushes. He pushed aside a small branch.

“Hello?” he said. “Anybody there?”

There was no answer.

“Come on!” Annie called down. “The tree house looks the same as it did yesterday.”

Jack still felt that someone was nearby. Could it be the person who’d put all the books in the tree house?

“Ja-ack!”

Jack gazed over the top of the bushes.

Was the mysterious person watching him now? The person whose name began with M?

Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. The one Jack had found on their dinosaur adventure. Maybe M wanted the leather bookmark back. The one from the castle book.

There was an M on the medallion. And an M on the bookmark. But what did M stand for?

“Tomorrow I’ll bring everything back,” Jack said loudly.

A breeze swept through the woods. The leaves rattled.

“Come on!” called Annie.

Jack went back to the big oak tree. He grabbed onto the rope ladder and climbed up.

At the top he crawled through a hole in the wooden floor. He tossed down his backpack and pushed his glasses into place.

“Hmmm. Which book is it going to be today?” said Annie.

She was looking at the books scattered around the tree house.

Annie picked up the book about castles.

“Hey, this isn’t wet anymore,” she said.

“Let me see.”

Jack took the book from her. He was amazed. It looked fine. Yesterday it had gotten soaked in a castle moat.

The castle book had taken Jack and Annie back to the time of knights.

Jack silently thanked the mysterious knight who had rescued them.

“Watch out!” warned Annie.

She waved a dinosaur book in Jack’s face.

“Put that away,” said Jack.

The day before yesterday the dinosaur book had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

Jack silently thanked the Pteranodon who had saved him from a Tyrannosaurus rex.

Annie put the dinosaur book back with the other books. Then she gasped.

“Wow,” she whispered. “Look at this.”

She held up a book about ancient Egypt.

Jack caught his breath. He took the book from her. A green silk bookmark stuck out of it.

Jack turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a pyramid.

Going toward the pyramid was a long parade. Four huge cows with horns were pulling a sled. On the sled was a long gold box. Many Egyptians were walking behind the sled. At the end of the parade was a sleek black cat.

“Let’s go there,” whispered Annie. “Now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. He wanted to study the book a bit more.

“Pyramids, Jack,” said Annie. “You love pyramids.”

It was true. Pyramids were high on his list of favorite things. After knights. But before dinosaurs. Way before dinosaurs.

He didn’t have to worry about being eaten by a pyramid.

“Okay,” he said. “But hold the Pennsylvania book. In case we want to come right back here.”

Annie found the book with the picture of their hometown in it. Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.

Then Jack pointed to the pyramid picture in the Egypt book. He cleared his throat and said, “I wish we could go to this place.”

“Meow!”

“What was that?” Jack looked out the tree house window.

A black cat was perched on a branch. Right outside the window. The cat was staring at Jack and Annie.



It was the strangest cat Jack had ever seen. He was very sleek and dark. With bright yellow eyes. And a wide gold collar.

“It’s the cat in the Egypt book,” whispered Annie.

Just then the wind started to blow. The leaves began to shake.

“Here we go!” cried Annie.

The wind whistled louder. The leaves shook harder.

Jack closed his eyes as the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster! And faster!

Suddenly everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Not a sound. Not a whisper.

Jack opened his eyes.

Hot bright sunlight nearly blinded him.

“Me-ow!”

For Patrick Robbins, who loves ancient Egypt




1. Meow!

“It’s still here,” said Jack.

“It looks empty,” said Annie.

Jack and his seven-year-old sister gazed up at a very tall oak tree. At the top of the tree was a tree house.

Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. It was almost time for lunch.

“Shhh!” said Jack. “What was that noise?”

“What noise?”

“I heard a noise,” Jack said. He looked around. “It sounded like someone coughing.”

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Annie. “Come on. Let’s go up.”

She grabbed onto the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack tiptoed over to a clump of bushes. He pushed aside a small branch.

“Hello?” he said. “Anybody there?”

There was no answer.

“Come on!” Annie called down. “The tree house looks the same as it did yesterday.”

Jack still felt that someone was nearby. Could it be the person who’d put all the books in the tree house?

“Ja-ack!”

Jack gazed over the top of the bushes.

Was the mysterious person watching him now? The person whose name began with M?

Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. The one Jack had found on their dinosaur adventure. Maybe M wanted the leather bookmark back. The one from the castle book.

There was an M on the medallion. And an M on the bookmark. But what did M stand for?

“Tomorrow I’ll bring everything back,” Jack said loudly.

A breeze swept through the woods. The leaves rattled.

“Come on!” called Annie.

Jack went back to the big oak tree. He grabbed onto the rope ladder and climbed up.

At the top he crawled through a hole in the wooden floor. He tossed down his backpack and pushed his glasses into place.

“Hmmm. Which book is it going to be today?” said Annie.

She was looking at the books scattered around the tree house.

Annie picked up the book about castles.

“Hey, this isn’t wet anymore,” she said.

“Let me see.”

Jack took the book from her. He was amazed. It looked fine. Yesterday it had gotten soaked in a castle moat.

The castle book had taken Jack and Annie back to the time of knights.

Jack silently thanked the mysterious knight who had rescued them.

“Watch out!” warned Annie.

She waved a dinosaur book in Jack’s face.

“Put that away,” said Jack.

The day before yesterday the dinosaur book had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

Jack silently thanked the Pteranodon who had saved him from a Tyrannosaurus rex.

Annie put the dinosaur book back with the other books. Then she gasped.

“Wow,” she whispered. “Look at this.”

She held up a book about ancient Egypt.

Jack caught his breath. He took the book from her. A green silk bookmark stuck out of it.

Jack turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a pyramid.

Going toward the pyramid was a long parade. Four huge cows with horns were pulling a sled. On the sled was a long gold box. Many Egyptians were walking behind the sled. At the end of the parade was a sleek black cat.

“Let’s go there,” whispered Annie. “Now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. He wanted to study the book a bit more.

“Pyramids, Jack,” said Annie. “You love pyramids.”

It was true. Pyramids were high on his list of favorite things. After knights. But before dinosaurs. Way before dinosaurs.

He didn’t have to worry about being eaten by a pyramid.

“Okay,” he said. “But hold the Pennsylvania book. In case we want to come right back here.”

Annie found the book with the picture of their hometown in it. Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.

Then Jack pointed to the pyramid picture in the Egypt book. He cleared his throat and said, “I wish we could go to this place.”

“Meow!”

“What was that?” Jack looked out the tree house window.

A black cat was perched on a branch. Right outside the window. The cat was staring at Jack and Annie.



It was the strangest cat Jack had ever seen. He was very sleek and dark. With bright yellow eyes. And a wide gold collar.

“It’s the cat in the Egypt book,” whispered Annie.

Just then the wind started to blow. The leaves began to shake.

“Here we go!” cried Annie.

The wind whistled louder. The leaves shook harder.

Jack closed his eyes as the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster! And faster!

Suddenly everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Not a sound. Not a whisper.

Jack opened his eyes.

Hot bright sunlight nearly blinded him.

“Me-ow!”



2. Oh, Man. Mummies!

Jack and Annie looked out the window.

The tree house was perched on the top of a palm tree. The tree stood with other palm trees. A patch of green surrounded by a sandy desert.

“Meow!”

Jack and Annie looked down.

The black cat was sitting at the base of the tree. His yellow eyes were staring up at Jack and Annie.

“Hi!” Annie shouted.

“Shhh,” said Jack. “Someone might hear you.”

“In the middle of the desert?” said Annie.

The black cat stood and began walking around the tree.

“Come back!” Annie called. She leaned out the window to see where the cat was going.

“Oh, wow!” she said. “Look, Jack.”

Jack leaned forward and looked down.

The cat was running away from the palm trees. Toward a giant pyramid in the desert.

A parade was going toward the pyramid. The same parade as in the Egypt book.



“It’s the picture from the book!” said Jack.

“What are those people doing?” asked Annie.

Jack looked down at the Egypt book. He read the words under the picture:

When a royal person died, a grand funeral procession took place. Family, servants, and mourners followed the coffin. The coffin was called a sarcophagus. It was pulled on a sled by four oxen.



“It’s an Egyptian funeral,” said Jack. “The box is called a sar … sar … sar … oh, forget it.”

He looked out the window again.

Oxen, sled, Egyptians, black cat. All were moving in a slow, dreamy way.

“I’d better make some notes about this,” said Jack.

He reached into his backpack and pulled out his notebook. Jack always kept notes.

“Wait,” said Jack. And he wrote:



“We’d better hurry,” said Annie, “if we want to see the mummy.”

She started down the rope ladder.

Jack looked up from his notebook.

“Mummy?” he said.

“There’s probably a mummy in that gold box,” Annie called up. “We’re in ancient Egypt. Remember?”

Jack loved mummies. He put down his pencil.

“Good-bye, Jack!” called Annie.

“Wait!” Jack called.

“Mummies!” Annie shouted.

“Oh, man,” said Jack weakly. “Mummies!” She sure knew how to get to him.

Jack shoved his notebook and the Egypt book into his pack. Then he started down the ladder.

When he got to the ground, he and Annie took off across the sand.

But as they ran a strange thing happened.

The closer they got to the parade, the harder it was to see it.

Then suddenly it was gone. The strange parade had disappeared. Vanished.

But the great stone pyramid was still there. Towering above them.

Panting, Jack looked around.

What had happened? Where were the people? The oxen? The gold box? The cat?

“They’re gone,” said Annie.

“Where did they go?” said Jack.

“Maybe they were ghosts,” said Annie.

“Don’t be silly. There’s no such thing as ghosts,” said Jack. “It must have been a mirage.”

“A what?”

“Mirage. It happens in the desert all the time,” said Jack. “It looks like something’s there. But it just turns out to be the sunlight reflecting through heat.”

“How could sunlight look like people, a mummy box, and a bunch of cows?” said Annie.

Jack frowned.

“Ghosts,” she said.

“No way,” said Jack.

“Look!” Annie pointed at the pyramid. Near the base was the sleek black cat.

He was standing alone. He was staring at Jack and Annie.

“He’s no mirage,” said Annie.

The cat started to slink away. He walked along the base of the pyramid and slid around a corner.

“Where’s he going?” said Jack.

“Let’s find out,” said Annie.

They dashed around the corner—just in time to see the cat disappear through a hole in the pyramid.



3. It’s Alive!

“Where did he go?” said Jack.

He and Annie peeked through the hole.

They saw a long hallway. Burning torches lit the walls. Dark shadows loomed.

“Let’s go in,” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack.

He pulled out the Egypt book and turned to the section on pyramids.

He read the caption aloud:

Pyramids were sometimes called Houses of the Dead. They were nearly all solid stone, except for the burial chambers deep inside.



“Wow. Let’s go there. To the burial chambers,” said Annie. “I bet a mummy’s there.”

Jack took a deep breath.

Then he stepped out of the hot, bright sunlight into the cool, dark pyramid.

The hallway was silent.

Floor, ceiling, walls—everything was stone.

The floor slanted up from where they stood.

“We have to go farther inside,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “But stay close behind me. Don’t talk. Don’t—”

“Go! Just go!” said Annie. She gave him a little push.

Jack started up the slanting floor of the hallway.

Where was the cat?

The hallway went on and on.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I want to look at the book.”

He opened the Egypt book again. He held it below a torch on the wall. The book showed a picture of the inside of the pyramid.

“The burial chamber is in the middle of the pyramid. See?” Jack said. He pointed to the picture. “It seems to be straight ahead.”

Jack tucked the book under his arm. Then they headed deeper into the pyramid.

Soon the floor became flat. The air felt different. Musty and stale.

Jack opened the book again. “I think we’re almost at the burial chamber. See the picture? The hallway slants up. Then it gets flat. Then you come to the chamber. See, look—”

“Eee-eee!” A strange cry shot through the pyramid.

Jack dropped the Egypt book.

Out of the shadows flew a white figure.

It swooshed toward them!

A mummy!

“It’s alive!” Annie shouted.



4. Back from the Dead

Jack pulled Annie down.

The white figure moved swiftly past them. Then disappeared into the shadows.

“A mummy,” said Annie. “Back from the dead!”

“F-forget it,” stammered Jack. “Mummies aren’t alive.” He picked up the Egypt book.

“What’s this?” said Annie. She lifted something from the floor. “Look. The mummy dropped this thing.”

It was a gold stick. About a foot long. A dog’s head was carved on one end.

“It looks like a scepter,” said Jack.

“What’s that?” asked Annie.

“It’s a thing kings and queens carry,” said Jack. “It means they have power over the people.”

“Come back, mummy!” Annie called. “We found your scepter. Come back! We want to help you!”

“Shush!” said Jack. “Are you nuts?”

“But the mummy—”

“That was no mummy,” said Jack. “It was a person. A real person.”

“What kind of person would be inside a pyramid?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book can help us.”

He flipped through the book. At last he found a picture of a person in a pyramid. He read:

Tomb robbers often carried off the treasure buried with mummies. False passages were sometimes built to stop the robbers.



Jack closed the book.

“No live mummy,” he said. “Just a tomb robber.”

“Yikes. A tomb robber?” said Annie.

“Yeah, a robber who steals stuff from tombs.”

“But what if the robber comes back,” said Annie. “We’d better leave.”

“Right,” said Jack. “But first I want to write something down.”

He put the Egypt book into his pack. He pulled out his notebook and pencil.

He started writing in his notebook:



“Jack—” said Annie.

“Just a second,” said Jack. He kept writing:



“Jack! Look!” said Annie.

Jack felt a whoosh of cold air. He looked up. A wave of terror went through him.

Another figure was moving slowly toward them.

It wasn’t a tomb robber.

No. It was a lady. A beautiful Egyptian lady.

She wore flowers in her black hair. Her long white dress had many tiny pleats. Her gold jewelry glittered.

“Here, Jack,” Annie whispered. “Give her this.” She handed him the gold scepter.

The lady stopped in front of them.

Jack held out the scepter. His hand was trembling.

He gasped. The scepter passed right through the lady’s hand.

She was made of air.



5. The Ghost-Queen

“A ghost,” Annie whispered.

But Jack could only stare in horror.

The ghost began to speak. She spoke in a hollow, echoing voice.

“I am Hutepi,” she said. “Queen of the Nile. Is it true that you have come to help me?”

“Yes,” said Annie.

Jack still couldn’t speak.

“For a thousand years,” said the ghost-queen, “I have waited for help.”

Jack’s heart was pounding so hard he thought he might faint.

“Someone must find my Book of the Dead,” she said. “I need it to go on to the Next Life.”

“Why do you need the Book of the Dead?” asked Annie. She didn’t sound scared at all.

“It will tell me the magic spells I need to get through the Underworld,” said the ghost-queen.

“The Underworld?” said Annie.

“Before I journey on to the Next Life, I must pass through the horrors of the Underworld.”

“What kinds of horrors?” Annie asked.

“Poisonous snakes,” said the ghost-queen. “Lakes of fire. Monsters. Demons.”

“Oh.” Annie stepped closer to Jack.

“My brother hid the Book of the Dead. So tomb robbers would not steal it,” said the ghost-queen. “Then he carved this secret message on the wall, telling me how to find it.”

She pointed to the wall.

Jack was still in shock. He couldn’t move.

“Where?” asked Annie. “Here?” She squinted at the wall. “What do these tiny pictures mean?”

The ghost-queen smiled sadly. “Alas, my brother forgot my strange problem. I cannot see clearly that which is close to my eyes. I have not been able to read his message for a thousand years.”

“Oh, that’s not a strange problem,” said Annie. “Jack can’t see anything either. That’s why he wears glasses.”

The ghost-queen stared in wonder at Jack.

“Jack, lend her your glasses,” said Annie.

Jack took his glasses off his nose. He held them out to the ghost-queen.

She backed away from him. “I fear I cannot wear your glasses, Jack,” she said. “I am made of air.”

“Oh. I forgot,” said Annie.

“But perhaps you will describe the hieroglyphs on these walls,” said the ghost-queen.

“Hi-row-who?” said Annie.

“Hieroglyphs!” said Jack, finally finding his voice. “It’s the ancient Egyptian way of writing. It’s like writing with pictures.”

The ghost-queen smiled at him. “Thank you, Jack,” she said.

Jack smiled back at her. He put his glasses on. Then he stepped toward the wall and took a good long look.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.



6. The Writing on the Wall

Jack and Annie squinted at the pyramid wall.

A series of tiny pictures were carved into the stone.



“There are four pictures here,” Jack told the ghost-queen.

“Describe them to me, Jack. One at a time, please,” she said.

Jack studied the first picture.



“Okay,” he said. “The first one is like this.” He made a zigzag in the air with his finger.

“Like stairs?” asked the ghost-queen.

“Yes, stairs!” said Jack. “Just like stairs.”

She nodded.

Easy enough.

Jack studied the second picture.



“The second one has a long box on the bottom,” he said. He drew it in the air.

The ghost-queen looked puzzled.

“With three things on top. Like this,” said Annie. She drew squiggly lines in the air.

The ghost-queen still seemed puzzled.

“Like a hat,” said Jack.

“Hat?” said the ghost-queen.

“No. More like a boat,” said Annie.

“Boat?” said the ghost-queen. She got excited. “Boat?”

Jack took another look at the wall.

“Yes. It could be a boat,” he said.

The ghost-queen looked very happy. She smiled.

“Yes. Of course,” she said.

Jack and Annie studied the next picture.



“The third one is like a thing that holds flowers,” said Annie.

“Or a thing that holds water,” said Jack.

“Like a jug?” asked the ghost-queen.

“Exactly,” said Jack.

“Yes. A jug,” said Annie.



Jack and Annie studied the last picture.



“And the last one looks like a pole that droops,” said Annie.

“Like a curved stick,” said Jack. “But one side is shorter than the other.”

The ghost-queen looked puzzled.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I’ll draw it in my notebook. Big! So you can see it.”

Jack put down the scepter and got out his pencil. He drew the hieroglyph.

“A folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.

“Well, not really,” said Jack. He studied his drawing.

“But that is the hieroglyph for a folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.

“Well, okay,” said Jack.

He looked at the fourth hieroglyph again. He still couldn’t see the folded cloth. Unless it was like a towel hanging over a bathroom rod.

“So that’s all of them,” said Annie. She pointed at each picture. “Stairs. Boat. Jug. Folded cloth.”

Jack wrote the words in his notebook.



“So what does the message mean?” he asked the ghost-queen.

“Come,” she said. She held out her hand.

“Come to my burial chambers.”

And she floated away.



7. The Scroll

Jack put the scepter and his notebook and pencil into his pack.

He and Annie followed the ghost-queen. Deeper into the pyramid. Until they came to some stairs.

“The STAIRS!” said Jack and Annie.

The ghost-queen floated up the stairs.

Jack and Annie followed.

The ghost-queen floated right through a wooden door.

Jack and Annie pushed on the door. It opened slowly.

They stepped into a cold, drafty room.

The ghost-queen was nowhere in sight.

Dim torchlight lit the huge room. It had a very high ceiling. On one side was a pile of tables, chairs, and musical instruments.

On the other side of the room was a small wooden boat.

“The BOAT!” said Jack.

“What’s it doing inside Queen Hutepi’s pyramid?” asked Annie.

“Maybe it’s supposed to carry her to the Next Life,” said Jack.

He and Annie went over to the boat. They looked inside it.

The boat was filled with many things. Gold plates. Painted cups. Jeweled goblets. Woven baskets. Jewelry with blue stones. Small wooden statues.

“Look!” said Jack.

He reached into the boat and lifted out a clay jug.

“The JUG!” said Annie.

Jack looked inside the jug.

“Something’s in here,” he said.

“What is it?” asked Annie.

Jack felt down inside the jug.

“It feels like a big napkin,” he said.

“The FOLDED CLOTH!” said Annie.

Jack reached into the jug and pulled out the folded cloth. It was wrapped around an ancient-looking scroll.

Jack slowly unrolled the scroll.

It was covered with wonderful hieroglyphs.

“The Book of the Dead!” whispered Annie. “We found it. We found her book.”

“Oh, man.” Jack traced his finger over the scroll. It felt like very old paper.

“Queen Hutepi!” called Annie. “We have it! We found your Book of the Dead!”

Silence.

“Queen Hutepi!”



Then another door on the other side of the chamber creaked open.

“In there,” said Annie. “Maybe she’s in there.”

Jack’s heart was pounding. Cold air was coming through the open doorway.

“Come on,” said Annie.

“Wait—”

“No,” said Annie. “She’s waited a thousand years for her book. Don’t make her wait anymore.”

Jack put the ancient scroll into his backpack. Then he and Annie slowly started to cross the drafty room.

They came to the open door. Annie went through first.

“Hurry, Jack!” she said.

Jack stepped into the other room.

It was nearly bare. Except for a long gold box. The box was open. The cover was on the floor.

“Queen Hutepi?” called Annie.

Silence.

“We found it,” said Annie. “Your Book of the Dead.”

There was still no sign of the ghost-queen.

The gold box glowed.

Jack could barely breathe. “Let’s leave the scroll on the floor. And go,” he said.

“No. I think we should leave it in there,” said Annie. She pointed to the gold box.

“No,” said Jack.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. “Come on.”

Annie took Jack by the arm. They walked together. Across the room. To the glowing gold box.

They stopped in front of the box. And they peered inside.



8. The Mummy

A real mummy.

Bandages were still wrapped around the bald skull. But most of the bandages had come off the face.

It was Hutepi. Queen of the Nile.

Her broken teeth were showing. Her little wrinkled ears. Her squashed nose. Her withered flesh. Her hollow eye sockets.

Plus the rotting bandages on her body were coming off. You could see bones.

“Oh, gross!” cried Annie. “Let’s go!”

“No,” said Jack. “It’s interesting.”

“Forget it!” said Annie. She started out of the room.

“Wait, Annie.”

“Come on, Jack. Hurry!” cried Annie. She was standing by the door.

Jack pulled out the Egypt book and flipped to a picture of a mummy. He read aloud:

Ancient Egyptians tried to protect the body so it would last forever. First it was dried out with salt.



“Ugh, stop!” said Annie.

“Listen,” said Jack. He kept reading:

Next it was covered with oil. Then it was wrapped tightly in bandages. The brain was removed by—



“Yuck! Stop!” cried Annie. “Good-bye!” She dashed out of the room.

“Annie!” called Jack. “We have to give her the Book of the Dead!”

But Annie was gone.

Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the scroll and the scepter. He put them next to the mummy’s skull.



Was it just his imagination? Or did a deep sigh seem to shudder throughout the room? Did the mummy’s face grow calmer?

Jack held his breath as he backed away. Out of the mummy room. Out of the boat room. Down the stairs.

At the bottom of the stairs, he heaved his own sigh. A sigh of relief.

He looked down the hallway. It was empty.

“Hey! Where are you?” he said.

No answer.

Where in the world was Annie?

Jack started down the hallway.

“Annie!” he called.

Had she run out of the pyramid? Was she already outside?

“Annie!”

“Help, Jack!” came a cry. The voice sounded far away.

It was Annie! Where was she?

“Help, Jack!”

“Annie!”

Jack started to run. Along the shadowy hallway.

“Help, Jack!” Her cry seemed fainter.

Jack stopped.

He was running away from her voice.

“Annie!” he called. He went back toward the burial chambers.

“Jack!”

There! Her voice was louder.

“Jack!”

Even louder!

Jack climbed the stairs. He went back into the boat room.

He looked around the room. At the furniture. The musical instruments. The boat.

Then he saw it. Another door! Right next to the door he had just come through.

The other door was open.

Jack dashed through it. He found himself at the top of some stairs.

They were just like the stairs in the other hallway.

He went down into the hallway. It was lit by torches on the wall.

It was just like the other hallway.

“Annie!” he called.

“Jack!”

“Annie!”

“Jack!”

She was running through the hallway toward him.

She crashed into him.

“I was lost!” she cried.

“I think this is one of those false passages. Built to fool the tomb robbers,” said Jack.

“A false passage?” said Annie, panting.

“Yeah, it looks just like the right hallway,” said Jack. “We have to go back into the boat room. And out the right door.”

Just then they heard a creaking noise.

Jack and Annie turned around. They looked up the stairs.

Then they watched in horror as the door slowly creaked shut.

A deep sound rumbled in the distance. And all the torches went out.



9. Follow the Leader

It was pitch dark.

“What happened?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know. Something weird,” said Jack. “We have to get out of here fast. Push against the door.”

“Good idea,” said Annie in a small voice.

They felt their way through the darkness. To the top of the stairs.

“Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay,” said Jack. He was trying to stay calm.

“Of course,” said Annie.

They leaned against the wooden door and pushed.

It wouldn’t budge.

They pushed harder.

No use.

Jack took a deep breath. It was getting harder to breathe. And harder to stay calm.

“What can we do?” asked Annie.

“Just … just rest a moment,” said Jack, panting.

His heart was pounding as he tried to see through the darkness.

“Maybe we should start down the hall,” he said. “Maybe we’ll eventually come to … to an exit.”

He wasn’t sure about that. But they had no choice.

“Come on,” he said. “Feel the wall.”

Jack felt the stone wall as he climbed slowly down the stairs. Annie followed.

Jack started down the dark hallway. It was impossible to see anything.

But he kept going. Taking one step at a time. Moving his hands along the wall.

He went around a corner. He went around another corner. He came to some stairs. He went up.

There was a door. He pushed against it. Annie pushed, too. This door wouldn’t budge either.

Was this the same door they had started at?

It was no use. They were trapped.

Annie took his hand in the dark. She squeezed it.

They stood together at the top of the stairs. Listening to the silence.

“Meow.”

“Oh, man,” Jack whispered.

“He’s back!” said Annie.



“Meow.”

“Follow him!” cried Jack. “He’s going away from us.”

They started down the dark hallway. Following the cat’s meow.

Hands against the wall, Jack and Annie stumbled through the darkness.

“Meow.”



They followed the sound. All the way through the winding hallway. Down, down, down.

Around one corner, then another. And another …

Finally they saw a light at the end of the tunnel. They rushed forward—out into the bright sunlight.

“Yay!” Annie shouted.

But Jack was thinking.

“Annie,” he said. “How did we get out of the false passage?”

“The cat,” said Annie.

“But how could the cat do it?” asked Jack.

“Magic,” said Annie.

Jack frowned. “But—”

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed.

The cat was bounding away. Over the sand.

“Thank you!” called Annie.

“Thanks!” Jack shouted at the cat.

His black tail waved.

Then he disappeared in the shimmering waves of heat.

Jack looked toward the palm trees. At the top of one sat the tree house. Like a bird’s nest.

“Time to go home,” Jack said.

He and Annie set off for the palm trees. It was a long hot walk back.

At last Annie grabbed onto the rope ladder. Then Jack.

Once they were inside the tree house, Jack reached for the book about Pennsylvania.

Just then he heard a rumbling sound. The same sound they had heard in the pyramid.

“Look!” Annie said, pointing out the window.

Jack looked.

A boat was beside the pyramid. It was gliding over the sand. Like a boat sailing over the sea.

Then it faded away. Into the distance.



Was it just a mirage?

Or was the ghost-queen finally on her way to the Next Life?

“Home, Jack,” whispered Annie.

Jack opened the Pennsylvania book.

He pointed to the picture of Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The leaves began to shake.

The wind blew harder. It whistled louder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely silent.



10. Another Clue

Late-morning sunlight shone through the tree house window. Shadows danced on the walls and ceiling.

Jack took a deep breath. He was lying on the floor of the tree house.

“I wonder what Mom’s making for lunch,” said Annie. She was looking out the window.

Jack smiled. Lunch. Mom. Home. It all sounded so real. So calm and safe.

“I hope it’s peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,” he said.

He closed his eyes. The wood floor felt cool.

“Boy, this place is a mess,” said Annie. “We’d better make it neater. In case M comes back.”

Jack had almost forgotten about M.

Would they ever meet the mysterious M? The person who seemed to own all the books in the tree house?

“Let’s put the Egypt book on the bottom of the pile,” said Annie.

“Good idea,” said Jack. He needed a rest before he visited any more ancient tombs.

“Let’s put the dinosaur book on top of the Egypt book,” said Annie.

“Yeah, good,” said Jack. And a long rest before he visited another Tyrannosaurus rex.

“The castle book can go on the very top of the pile,” said Annie.

Jack nodded and smiled. He liked thinking about the knight on the cover of the castle book. He felt as if the knight were his friend.

“Jack,” said Annie. “Look!”

Jack opened his eyes. She was pointing at the wooden floor.

“What is it?” he asked.

“You have to see for yourself.”

Jack groaned as he got up. He stood next to Annie and looked at the floor. He didn’t see anything.

“Turn your head a little,” said Annie. “You have to catch the light just right.”

Jack tipped his head to one side. Something was shining on the floor.

He tipped his head a bit more. A letter came into focus.

The letter M! It shimmered in the sunlight.

This proved the tree house belonged to M.



Absolutely for sure. No question. No doubt about it.

Jack touched the M with his finger. His skin tingled.

Just then the leaves trembled. The wind picked up.

“Let’s go down now,” he said.

Jack grabbed his backpack. Then he and Annie climbed down the ladder.

As they stood on the ground below the tree house, Jack heard a sound in the bushes.

“Who’s there?” he called.

The woods grew still.

“I’m going to bring the medallion back soon,” Jack said loudly. “And the bookmark, too. Both of them. Tomorrow!”

“Who are you talking to?” asked Annie.

“I feel like M is nearby,” Jack whispered.

Annie’s eyes grew wide. “Should we look for him?”

But just then their mother’s voice came from the distance. “Ja-ack! An-nie!”

Jack and Annie looked around at the trees. Then they looked at each other.

“Tomorrow,” they said together.

And they took off, running out of the woods.

They ran down their street.

They ran across their yard.

They ran into their house.

They ran into their kitchen.

They ran right into their mom.

She was making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Jack stared out his bedroom window. The rain kept falling. And falling.

“The TV said it would stop by noon,” said Annie, his seven-year-old sister.

“It’s already past noon,” said Jack.

“But we have to go to the tree house,” said Annie. “I have a feeling the M person will be there today.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure he was ready to meet the M person yet. The mysterious person who had put all the books in the magic tree house.

“Come on,” said Annie.

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “You get our raincoats and boots. I’ll get the medallion and bookmark.”

Annie ran to get their rain gear.

Jack reached into his drawer. He took out the medallion.

It was gold. The letter M was engraved on it.

Then he took out the bookmark. It was made of blue leather. It had the same M on it.

Both M’s matched the M that was on the floor of the tree house.

Jack put the medallion and bookmark into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and pencil. Jack liked to take notes about important things.

“I got our rain stuff!” called Annie.

Jack picked up his pack and went downstairs. Annie was waiting by the back door. She was putting on her boots. “Meet you outside,” she said.

Jack pulled on his raincoat and boots. Then he put on his backpack and joined her.

The wind was blowing hard.

“Ready! Set! Go!” shouted Annie.

They kept their heads down and charged into the rainy wind.

Soon they were in the Frog Creek woods.

Tree branches swayed, flinging rainwater everywhere.

“Yuck!” said Annie.

They splashed through puddles. Until they came to the tallest oak tree in the woods.

They looked up.

Tucked between two branches was the tree house. It looked dark and lonely against the stormy sky.

Hanging from the tree house was a rope ladder. It was blowing in the wind.

Jack thought of all the books up there. He hoped they weren’t getting wet.

“The M person’s been there,” said Annie.

Jack caught his breath. “How can you tell?” he said.

“I can feel it,” she whispered.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Inside the tree house it was chilly and damp.

But the books were dry. They were all neatly stacked along the wall. Just the way they had been the day before.

Annie picked up a castle book on top of one stack. It had taken them to the time of castles.

“Remember the knight?” she said.

Jack nodded. He would never forget the knight who had helped them.

Annie put down the castle book. She picked up the next book on the stack.

It was the dinosaur book that had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

“Remember?” she said.

Jack nodded.

He’d never forget the pteranodon who had saved him from the Tyrannosaurus rex.

Then Annie held up a book about ancient Egypt.

“Meow,” she said.

Jack smiled. The Egypt book had taken them to the time of pyramids. A black cat had come to the rescue there.

“And here’s the book about home,” Annie said.

She held up the book with the picture of their hometown in it.

Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.

Jack smiled again. The Pennsylvania book had brought them back home at the end of each of their adventures.

Jack sighed. Okay. He still had two main questions.

Who was the M person who had put all the books here?

And did the knight, the pteranodon, and the cat all know the M person?

Finally Jack reached into his backpack. He took out the gold medallion and the leather bookmark. He placed them on the floor. Right over the spot where the M glowed faintly in the wood.

Rain blew into the tree house.

“Brr!” said Annie. “It’s not very cozy today.”

Jack agreed with her. It was too wet and cold.

“Look.” Annie pointed to an open book lying in the corner. “I don’t remember a book being open.”

“Me neither,” said Jack.

Annie picked up the book. She stared at the picture on the page.

“Wow, this place looks great.” She showed the picture to Jack.

He saw a sunny beach. A big green parrot sitting in a palm tree. And a ship sailing on a blue sea.

Another gust of rainy wind blew into the tree house.

Annie pointed to the picture. “I wish we were there instead of here,” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But where is there?”

“Too late!” came a squawk.

Jack and Annie turned quickly.



Sitting on a branch outside the window ledge of the tree house was a green parrot. Exactly like the parrot in the picture.

“Too late!” the parrot squawked again.

“A talking parrot!” said Annie. “Is your name Polly? Can I call you Polly?”

Suddenly the wind started to whistle.

“Oh no! Now we’re in big trouble!” said Jack.

The wind blew harder.

The leaves shook.

The tree house started to spin. Faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

“Too late!” squawked Polly.

1. Too Late!

Jack stared out his bedroom window. The rain kept falling. And falling.

“The TV said it would stop by noon,” said Annie, his seven-year-old sister.

“It’s already past noon,” said Jack.

“But we have to go to the tree house,” said Annie. “I have a feeling the M person will be there today.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure he was ready to meet the M person yet. The mysterious person who had put all the books in the magic tree house.

“Come on,” said Annie.

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “You get our raincoats and boots. I’ll get the medallion and bookmark.”

Annie ran to get their rain gear.

Jack reached into his drawer. He took out the medallion.

It was gold. The letter M was engraved on it.

Then he took out the bookmark. It was made of blue leather. It had the same M on it.

Both M’s matched the M that was on the floor of the tree house.

Jack put the medallion and bookmark into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and pencil. Jack liked to take notes about important things.

“I got our rain stuff!” called Annie.

Jack picked up his pack and went downstairs. Annie was waiting by the back door. She was putting on her boots. “Meet you outside,” she said.

Jack pulled on his raincoat and boots. Then he put on his backpack and joined her.

The wind was blowing hard.

“Ready! Set! Go!” shouted Annie.

They kept their heads down and charged into the rainy wind.

Soon they were in the Frog Creek woods.

Tree branches swayed, flinging rainwater everywhere.

“Yuck!” said Annie.

They splashed through puddles. Until they came to the tallest oak tree in the woods.

They looked up.

Tucked between two branches was the tree house. It looked dark and lonely against the stormy sky.

Hanging from the tree house was a rope ladder. It was blowing in the wind.

Jack thought of all the books up there. He hoped they weren’t getting wet.

“The M person’s been there,” said Annie.

Jack caught his breath. “How can you tell?” he said.

“I can feel it,” she whispered.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Inside the tree house it was chilly and damp.

But the books were dry. They were all neatly stacked along the wall. Just the way they had been the day before.

Annie picked up a castle book on top of one stack. It had taken them to the time of castles.

“Remember the knight?” she said.

Jack nodded. He would never forget the knight who had helped them.

Annie put down the castle book. She picked up the next book on the stack.

It was the dinosaur book that had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

“Remember?” she said.

Jack nodded.

He’d never forget the pteranodon who had saved him from the Tyrannosaurus rex.

Then Annie held up a book about ancient Egypt.

“Meow,” she said.

Jack smiled. The Egypt book had taken them to the time of pyramids. A black cat had come to the rescue there.

“And here’s the book about home,” Annie said.

She held up the book with the picture of their hometown in it.

Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.

Jack smiled again. The Pennsylvania book had brought them back home at the end of each of their adventures.

Jack sighed. Okay. He still had two main questions.

Who was the M person who had put all the books here?

And did the knight, the pteranodon, and the cat all know the M person?

Finally Jack reached into his backpack. He took out the gold medallion and the leather bookmark. He placed them on the floor. Right over the spot where the M glowed faintly in the wood.

Rain blew into the tree house.

“Brr!” said Annie. “It’s not very cozy today.”

Jack agreed with her. It was too wet and cold.

“Look.” Annie pointed to an open book lying in the corner. “I don’t remember a book being open.”

“Me neither,” said Jack.

Annie picked up the book. She stared at the picture on the page.

“Wow, this place looks great.” She showed the picture to Jack.

He saw a sunny beach. A big green parrot sitting in a palm tree. And a ship sailing on a blue sea.

Another gust of rainy wind blew into the tree house.

Annie pointed to the picture. “I wish we were there instead of here,” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But where is there?”

“Too late!” came a squawk.

Jack and Annie turned quickly.



Sitting on a branch outside the window ledge of the tree house was a green parrot. Exactly like the parrot in the picture.

“Too late!” the parrot squawked again.

“A talking parrot!” said Annie. “Is your name Polly? Can I call you Polly?”

Suddenly the wind started to whistle.

“Oh no! Now we’re in big trouble!” said Jack.

The wind blew harder.

The leaves shook.

The tree house started to spin. Faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

“Too late!” squawked Polly.



2. The Bright Blue Sea

Jack felt hot sunlight streaming into the tree house.

He smelled saltwater.

He heard the sound of waves.

He and Annie looked out the window.

The tree house was in a palm tree. Beyond was a bright blue sea. A tall sailing ship was on the horizon. It was just like the picture in the book.

“Too late!” squawked Polly.

“Look!” said Annie.

Polly was flying in circles above the tree house. Then she swooped down to the ocean.

“Come on, let’s follow her! Let’s go in the water!” said Annie. She took off her raincoat and dropped it on the floor.

“Wait, we have to study the book first,” said Jack. He started to reach for the book. But Annie grabbed it.

“You can read it on the beach,” she said. Without even looking at the cover, she shoved the book into Jack’s backpack.

He sighed. Actually, the water did look wonderful.

“Okay,” Jack said. He took off his raincoat, too.

“Come on!” Annie handed Jack his backpack, then started down the ladder.

Jack folded the raincoat and put it next to the stack of books. He put on his backpack. Then he went down the ladder.

As soon as Annie hit the sand, she ran toward the ocean. Jack watched her wade into the water. She was still wearing her rain boots.

“Your boots, Annie,” called Jack.

She shrugged. “They’ll dry out,” she said.

Jack took off his boots and socks. He put them beside his pack. Then he rolled up his jeans. And ran across the hot sand into the waves.

The water was warm and clear. Jack could see shells and tiny fishes.

He shielded his eyes against the sun. And peered out at the sea.

The tall sailing ship seemed a bit closer.

“Where’s Polly?” said Annie.

Jack glanced around. No sign of Polly. Not in the palm trees. Not on the sunlit sand. Not over the bright blue sea.



When Jack looked out at the sea again, the ship seemed even closer. Now Jack could see its flag.

As he stared at the ship’s flag, a chill went through him.

The flag was black. With a skull and crossbones.

“Oh man,” he breathed. He started out of the water.

“What’s wrong?” said Annie. She splashed after him.

Jack ran to his backpack. Annie followed.

He grabbed the book from his backpack. He looked at the cover. For the first time, he and Annie read the title of the book.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Pirates of the Caribbean,” Jack read aloud.



3. Three Men in a Boat

“We’ve come to the time of pirates!” Jack said.

“Pirates?” squeaked Annie. “Like in Peter Pan?”

Jack flipped to the picture that showed the parrot, the sea and the ship.

He read the caption under the picture:

Three hundred years ago, pirates raided Spanish treasure ships in the Caribbean Sea.



He grabbed his notebook and pencil from his pack. He wrote:



He turned to the next page. There was a picture of a pirate flag. He read:

The skull-and-crossbones flag was called the Jolly Roger.



“Let’s go!” said Annie.

“Wait!” said Jack. “I want to make a drawing of the flag.”

He propped the pirate book in the sand.

He started drawing the Jolly Roger flag.

“Don’t copy the picture in the book,” said Annie. “Look at the real thing.”

But Jack pushed his glasses into place and kept drawing.

“Jack, some pirates are getting into a rowboat,” said Annie.

Jack kept drawing.

“Jack, the boat’s leaving the big ship,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked up.

“Look.” Annie pointed.

Jack looked. He saw the rowboat coming toward the shore.

“Run!” said Annie. She started running toward the tree house.

Jack jumped up. His glasses fell off.

“Hurry!” Annie called back to him.

Jack went down on his knees. He felt for his glasses. Where were they?

Jack saw something glinting in the sand. He reached for it. It was his glasses. He snatched them up.

Then he threw his notebook and pencil into his pack. He put the pack on his back.

He grabbed his boots and his socks. And he took off running.

“Hurry! They’re coming!” Annie was at the top of the rope ladder.

Jack looked back at the sea. The pirates were closer to the shore.

Suddenly Jack saw the pirate book. In all the confusion he had forgotten it. It was still propped in the sand.

“Oh man, I forgot the book!” he said. He dropped his socks and boots below the tree house.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie shouted.

“I’ll be right back!” Jack called. “I’ve got to get the book!”

“Jack, forget it!”

But Jack was already running toward the water.

Jack grabbed the book.

“Come back!” Annie shouted.

Jack shoved the book into his backpack.

Suddenly a giant wave carried the rowboat right onto the beach.

“Run, Jack!” shouted Annie.

Three big pirates splashed onto the sand.

They had knives in their teeth.

They had pistols in their belts.

They charged toward Jack.

“Run, Jack, run!” cried Annie.



4. Vile Booty

Jack started to run across the hot sand. He ran as fast as he could.

But the pirates ran faster.

Before Jack knew it, the biggest pirate had grabbed him!

Jack struggled. But the pirate had huge, strong arms. He held on to Jack and laughed a mean, ugly laugh. He had a shaggy black beard. A patch covered one eye.

Jack heard Annie yelling. He saw her coming down the rope ladder.

“Stay where you are!” Jack shouted.

But Annie kept coming. “Leave him alone, you bully!” she cried.

The other two pirates laughed meanly. They were dirty and ragged.

Annie charged up to the biggest pirate. “Let him go!” she said. She hit the pirate with her fist and kicked him.

But the pirate just growled. Then he grabbed her, too. And with his giant hands, he held Jack and Annie as if they were two kittens.

“No one escapes Cap’n Bones!” he roared. His breath was terrible.

“Let go!” Annie shouted into his face.

But Cap’n Bones just smiled. All his teeth were black.

Annie fell silent.

Cap’n Bones laughed loudly. Then he turned to the other two.



“Find out what’s in their house, you dogs,” he said.

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!” they answered. And they started up the ladder to the tree house.

“What do you spy, Pinky?” shouted Cap’n Bones.

“Books, Cap’n!” Pinky shouted down.

“Aghh, books,” growled Cap’n Bones. He spit on the sand. “I want gold, you dogs!”

“Dogs are nicer than you,” said Annie.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

“What about you, Stinky?” Cap’n Bones roared.

“Just books, Cap’n!” shouted Stinky.

“Aghh, books,” said Cap’n Bones. He spit on the sand again. “I hate books! Keep looking, dogs! Find me something good!”

Cap’n Bones grabbed Jack’s backpack. “What’s in here?” he said.

“Nothing—” Jack quickly opened the pack. “Just paper, a pencil, a book.”

“Another book!” roared Cap’n Bones. “That’s vile booty!”

A gleeful shriek pierced the air.

Cap’n Bones froze. “What’s that?” he shouted.

“Look, Cap’n! Look!”

Pinky leaned out the tree house window. He held the medallion. It glimmered in the sunlight.

Oh brother, thought Jack.

“Throw it down!” cried Cap’n Bones.

“It’s not yours!” shouted Annie.

Cap’n Bones dropped Jack and Annie. He caught the medallion as it fell.

“Gold! Gold! Gold!” he cried. Cap’n Bones threw back his head and laughed horribly.

He grabbed two of his pistols. He shot them into the air. Pinky and Stinky howled like wolves.



5. The Kid’s Treasure

Jack and Annie watched in horror.

The gold-greedy pirates seemed to have lost their minds.

Jack nudged Annie. Together they started to back slowly away from the pirates. Toward the tree house.

“Halt!” Cap’n Bones shouted. He aimed his pistols at them. “Not another step, lubbers!”

Jack and Annie froze.

Cap’n Bones grinned his black-toothed grin. “Tell old Bones where the rest is,” he growled. “Or prepare to meet thy doom.”

“What—what rest?” said Annie.

“The rest of the treasure!” roared Cap’n Bones. “I know it’s on this island. I have a map!”

He reached into a belt pouch and pulled out a torn piece of paper. He waved it at Jack and Annie.

“Is that a treasure map?” asked Jack.

“Aye, it’s the map telling about Kidd’s treasure.”

“Which kid’s treasure? Not us kids,” said Annie. “We don’t know anything about a kid’s treasure.”

“Why don’t you read the map?” said Jack.

“You read it!” Cap’n Bones shoved the map in Jack’s face.

Jack stared at the strange marks on the paper.

“What does that mean?” asked Jack.

“What does what mean?” asked Cap’n Bones.

“Those words.” Jack pointed at the words at the bottom of the map.

“Well, it means … ” Cap’n Bones’ good eye squinted at the writing. He frowned. He coughed. He rubbed his nose.

“Aw, leave him alone,” Pinky growled at Jack.

“You know he can’t read,” said Stinky.

“Shut up!” Cap’n Bones roared at his men.

“Jack and I can read,” Annie piped up.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

“Cap’n, make ’em read the map!” said Stinky.

Cap’n Bones gave Jack and Annie a dark look. “Read it,” he growled.

“Then will you let us go?” said Jack.





The pirate squinted his good eye. “Aye, lubber. When the treasure’s in me hands, I’ll let you go.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “I’ll read it to you.” He looked at the map. “It says, The gold doth lie beneath the whale’s eye.”

“Heh?” Cap’n Bones scowled. “What’s that supposed to mean, lubber?”

Jack shrugged.

“Hang it! Take ’em hack to the ship!” shouted Cap’n Bones. “They can rot there till they’re ready to tell us how to find Kidd’s treasure!”

Jack and Annie were tossed into the rowboat.

Waves splashed the sides. The sky ahead was dark with thunderclouds. A strong wind had started to blow.

“Row, dogs, row!” said Cap’n Bones.

Pinky and Stinky began rowing toward the big ship.

“Look!” Annie said to Jack. She pointed to the shore.

Polly the parrot was flying over the sand.

“She wants to help us,” whispered Annie.

Polly started to fly out over the waves. But the winds were too strong. She turned around and flew back to the island.



6. The Whale’s Eye

The rowboat tossed from side to side. The waves were huge. Salty spray stung Jack’s eyes. He felt seasick.

“Hold ’er steady!” shouted Cap’n Bones.

He pointed at the sea. “Or we’ll be meat for those evil brutes!”

Dark fins cut through the water. Sharks. One zoomed right by the boat. Jack could have reached out and touched it.

He shuddered.

Soon the rowboat pulled alongside the ship.

The air was filled with wild fiddle music and bagpipes playing. And Jack heard jeers, shouts, and ugly laughter.

“Hoist ’em aboard!” Cap’n Bones shouted to his men.

Annie and Jack were hauled onto the deck.



The ship creaked and moaned. It rolled from side to side. Ropes flapped and snapped in the wild wind.

Everywhere they looked, Jack and Annie saw pirates.

Some were dancing. Some were drinking. Many were fighting. With swords. Or with their fists.

“Lock ’em in my cabin!” Cap’n Bones ordered.

A couple of pirates grabbed Jack and Annie. And threw them in the ship’s cabin. Then locked the door.

The air inside the cabin was damp and sour-smelling. A shaft of gray light came through a small round window.

“Oh man,” said Jack. “We’ve got to figure out how to get back to the island.”

“So we can get into the tree house and go home,” said Annie.

“Right.” Jack suddenly felt tired. How would they ever get out of this mess?

“We better examine the book,” he said.

He reached into his pack and pulled out the pirate book.

He flipped through the pages.

He looked for information to help them.

“Look,” he said.

He found a picture of pirates burying a treasure chest. “This might help.”

Together they read the words under the picture.

Captain Kidd was a famous pirate. It is said that he buried a treasure chest on a deserted island. The chest was filled with gold and jewels.



“Captain Kidd!” said Jack.

“So that’s the kid that Bones keeps talking about,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

Annie looked out the round window.

“And Captain Kidd’s treasure is buried somewhere on the island,” she said.

Jack took out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:



“Ja-ack,” Annie said.

“Shhh, wait a minute,” he said. “I’m thinking.”

“Guess what I see?” said Annie.

“What?” Jack asked. He looked back at the book.

“A whale.”

“Neat,” he said. Then he looked up. “A whale? Did you say … a whale?”

“A whale. A huge whale. As big as a football field.”

Jack jumped up and looked out the window with her.

“Where?” Jack asked. All he could see was the island. And stormy waves. And shark fins.

“There!” said Annie.

“Where? Where?”

“There! The island is shaped like a giant whale!”

“Oh man,” whispered Jack. Now he could see it.

“See the whale’s back?” said Annie.

“Yep.” The slope of the island looked like the back of a whale.

“See his spout?” said Annie.

“Yep.” The palm tree that held the tree house looked like the spout of the whale.

“See his eye?” said Annie.

“Yep.” A big black rock looked like the eye of the whale.

“The gold doth lie beneath the whale’s eye,” whispered Jack. “Wow.”



7. Gale’s a-Blowin’

“So the treasure must be under that rock,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “Now we just have to get back to the island. We’ll show Cap’n Bones where the treasure is. Then while all the pirates are digging, we’ll sneak up to the tree house.”

“And make a wish to go home,” said Annie.

“Right.” Jack poked his head out of the round window of the cabin. “Cap’n Bones, sir!” he shouted.

The pirates took up the cry. “Cap’n Bones! Cap’n Bones!”

“Hey?” came a horrible voice.

Cap’n Bones stuck his ugly face through the window. His good eye glared at Jack. “What do you want, lubbers?”

“We’re ready to tell the truth, sir,” said Jack.

“Go ahead,” growled Cap’n Bones.

“We know where Captain Kidd’s treasure is.”

“Where?”

“We can’t just tell you. We have to show you,” said Annie.

Cap’n Bones gave Annie and Jack a long hard look.

“You’ll need a rope,” said Jack.

“And shovels,” said Annie.

Cap’n Bones growled. Then he roared at his men, “Get some rope and shovels!”

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!”

“Then throw these lubbers in the boat! We’re going back to the island!”

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!”

Back in the rowboat, Jack saw the sky had grown even darker with clouds. The waves were bigger. The wind was howling.

“Gale’s a-blowin’!” said Pinky.

“You’ll see a gale if I don’t get me gold today, by thunder!” Cap’n Bones shouted. “Row, dogs, row!”

The three pirates battled the waves, until the rowboat reached the island. They all piled onto the shore.

Cap’n Bones grabbed Jack and Annie.

“Okay, lubbers,” he said. “Now show us where the treasure is.”

“There,” said Annie. She pointed at the black rock near the tip of the island.

“Under that rock,” said Jack.

Cap’n Bones dragged Jack and Annie down the beach to the black rock.

“Get to work!” Cap’n Bones said to Pinky and Stinky.

“What about you?” said Annie.

“Me? Work?” Cap’n Bones chuckled.

Jack gulped. How could they get away from him?

“Don’t you think you should help your friends?” he said.

Cap’n Bones gave Jack a horrible grin. “Nay. I’m going to hold you two—till there’s treasure in me hands!”



8. Dig, Dogs, Dig

Pinky and Stinky tied their rope around the big rock.

The wind howled. The two pirates pulled. And pulled. And pulled.

“They need help!” said Jack.

“Aghh, let the dogs do the work!” growled Cap’n Bones.

“You’re not very nice to them,” said Annie.

“Who cares?” roared Cap’n Bones.

“Cap’n! We got it!” shouted Pinky.



They started pulling the rock across the sand.

“Now let’s dig where the rock was,” said Jack. “All of us!”

But Cap’n Bones ignored his suggestion.

“Dig, you dogs!” he shouted.

Pinky and Stinky started to dig. The wind blew even harder. There was going to be a thunderstorm.

“Oww! I got sand in me eyes!” Pinky whined.

“Oww! Me back hurts!” Stinky cried.

“Dig!” shouted Cap’n Bones. He held Jack and Annie with one hand. With the other he pulled out the gold medallion.

He tossed it at the two pirates. It fell into the hole.

“Dig for more of these, you swine!” he said.

Squawk!

“Look!” Annie said.

Polly was back! She was circling above them!

“Go back!” she squawked.

Stinky and Pinky looked up at the parrot. They scowled.

“Dig!” shouted Cap’n Bones.

“A big storm is comin’, Cap’n!” said Pinky.

“Go back!” said Polly.

“The bird’s an omen, Cap’n!” shouted Stinky.

“Dig, you dogs!” cried Cap’n Bones.

“Go back!” squawked Polly.

“The bird’s warning us!” shouted Pinky. “We’ve got to get to the ship before it’s too late!”

The two pirates threw down their shovels. They started running toward the rowboat.

“Mutineers! Come back!” shouted Cap’n Bones. He dragged Jack and Annie down the beach as he ran after his men. “Stop!”

But the pirates kept running. They got to the rowboat and pushed it into the sea.

“Wait!” cried Cap’n Bones.

Pinky and Stinky jumped into the boat. They started rowing.

“Wait!” Cap’n Bones let go of Jack and Annie. He ran into the water. “Wait, you dogs!”

He hauled himself into the rowboat.

Then the three pirates disappeared into the spray of the waves.

“Go back!” squawked Polly.

“She means us!” said Annie.

Just then the storm broke over the island. The wind howled. Rain fell in buckets.

“Let’s go!” cried Annie.

“Wait! I have to get the medallion!” shouted Jack. He ran to the hole dug by the pirates. He looked down in it.

Even in the dreary light, the medallion was shining.

Big, fat raindrops were falling into the hole, washing away the sand.

Jack saw a patch of wood.

Then the rain cleared away more sand. And Jack saw the top of an old trunk.

He stared. Was it Captain Kidd’s treasure chest?

“Hurry, Jack!” cried Annie. She was halfway up the tree house ladder.

“I found it! I found it!” cried Jack. “I found the treasure chest!”

“Forget the treasure chest!” said Annie. “We have to go now! The storm’s getting worse!”

Jack kept staring at the chest. Was there gold inside? Silver? Precious gems?

“Come on!” Now Annie was shouting from the tree house window.

But Jack couldn’t tear himself away. He brushed the rest of the muddy sand off the chest.

“Jack, forget the treasure chest!” cried Annie. “Let’s go!”

“Go back!” squawked Polly.

Jack looked at the parrot. She was perched on the black rock.



He stared into her wise eyes. He thought he knew her—knew her from somewhere else.

“Go back, Jack,” she said. She sounded like a person.

Okay. It was definitely time to go.

Jack took one last look at the treasure chest. He clutched the gold medallion. Then he took off, running toward the tree house.

His socks and rain boots were still there. He quickly pulled the boots on. He shoved the socks into his backpack.

The rope ladder was dancing wildly in the wind. Jack grabbed it.

The ladder swayed as Jack climbed. He was tossed this way and that. But he held on tight.

At last he pulled himself into the tree house.

“Let’s go!” he cried.

Annie was already holding the Pennsylvania book. She pointed to the picture of Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go there!” she shouted.

The wind was already blowing hard. But now it blew even harder.

The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



9. The Mysterious M

Drip, drip.

Jack opened his eyes.

Rain was dripping from the leaves of the tree.

They were back in Frog Creek. The rain was softer. The wind was gentler. The air was sweeter.

“Oh man.” Jack sighed. “That was close.” He was still holding the gold medallion.

“Polly’s gone,” said Annie sadly. “I was hoping she might come back with us.”

“No magic creature has ever come back with us,” said Jack.

He pulled off his backpack. It was damp with rain and saltwater.

Jack took out the pirate book. He put it on the stack of books. On top of the dinosaur book. And the knight book. And the mummy book.

Then Jack put the gold medallion beside the bookmark with the letter M.

Next he went down onto his knees. And ran his finger over the shimmering M on the floor. “We didn’t find any M’s on this trip,” he said.

“Or the M person,” said Annie.

Squawk!

“Polly!” Annie cried.

The parrot swooshed into the tree house. She perched on the stack of books.

Polly looked straight at Jack.

“What—what are you doing here?” he asked her.

Slowly Polly raised her bright green wings. They grew bigger and bigger until they spread out like a huge green cape.



Then, in a great swirl of colors—in a blur of feathers and light—in a flapping and stretching and screeching—a new being took shape.

Polly was not a parrot any longer. In her place was an old woman. A beautiful old woman with long white hair and piercing eyes.



She wore a green feathered cape. She perched on the stack of books. And she was very calm and very still.

Neither Jack nor Annie could speak. They were too amazed.

“Hello, Jack. Hello, Annie,” the old woman said. “My name is Morgan le Fay.”



10. Treasure Again

Annie found her voice first. “The M person,” she whispered.

“Yes. I’m the M person,” said Morgan.

“Wh-where are you from?” asked Jack.

“Have you ever heard of King Arthur?” said Morgan.

Jack nodded.

“Well, I am King Arthur’s sister,” said Morgan.

“You’re from Camelot,” said Jack. “I’ve read about Camelot.”

“What did you read about me, Jack?” said Morgan.

“You—you’re a witch.”

Morgan smiled. “You can’t believe everything you read, Jack.”

“But are you a magician?” said Annie.

“Most call me an enchantress. But I’m also a librarian,” said Morgan.

“A librarian?” said Annie.

“Yes. And I’ve come to the 20th century, your time, to collect books. You are lucky to be born in a time with so many books.”

“For the Camelot library?” asked Jack.

“Precisely,” said Morgan. “I travel in this tree house to collect words from many different places around the world. And from many different time periods.”

“Did you find books here?” said Jack.

“Oh yes. Many wonderful books. I want to borrow them for our scribes to copy.”

“Did you put all the bookmarks in them?” said Jack.

“Yes. You see, I like the pictures in the books. Sometimes I want to visit the scenes in the pictures. So all the bookmarks mark places I wish to go.”

“How do you get there?” asked Annie.

“I placed a spell on the tree house,” said Morgan. “So when I point to a picture and make the wish, the tree house takes me there.”

“I think you dropped this in dinosaur times,” said Jack.

He handed the gold medallion to Morgan.

“Oh, thank you! I wondered where I’d lost it,” she said. She put the medallion into a hidden pocket in her cape.

“So can anybody work the spell?” asked Annie. “Anybody who tries it?”

“Oh dear, no! Not just anybody,” Morgan said. “You two are the only ones besides me to do it. No one else has ever even seen my tree house before.”

“Is it invisible?” asked Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “I had no idea it would ever be discovered. But then you two came along. Somehow you hooked right into my magic.”

“H-how?” asked Jack.

“Well, for two reasons, I think,” explained Morgan. “First, Annie believes in magic. So she actually saw the tree house. And her belief helped you to see it, Jack.”

“Oh man,” said Jack.

“Then you picked up a book, Jack. And because you love books so much, you caused my magic spell to work.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“You can’t imagine my dismay when you started to take off for dinosaur times. I had to make a very quick decision. And I decided to come along.”

“Oh, so you were the pteranodon!” said Annie.

Morgan smiled.

“And the cat and the knight and Polly!” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan softly.

“You were all these things to help us?” asked Jack.

“Yes, but I must go home now. The people in Camelot need my help.”

“You’re leaving?” whispered Jack.

“I’m afraid I must,” said Morgan.

She picked up Jack’s backpack and handed it to him. Jack and Annie picked up their raincoats. It had stopped raining.

“You won’t forget us, will you?” asked Annie, as they put their raincoats on.

“Never,” said Morgan. She smiled at both of them. “You remind me too much of myself. You love the impossible, Annie. And you love knowledge, Jack. What better combination is there?”

Morgan le Fay touched Annie’s forehead gently. And then Jack’s. She smiled.

“Good-bye,” she said.

“Good-bye,” said Annie and Jack.

Annie left the tree house first. Jack followed. They climbed down the rope ladder for the last time.

They stood below the oak tree and looked up.

Morgan was looking out the window. Her long white hair blew in the breeze.

Suddenly the wind began to blow.



The leaves began to shake.

A loud whistling sound filled the air.

Jack covered his ears and squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.

Jack opened his eyes.

The tree house was gone.

All gone.

Absolutely gone.

Annie and Jack stood a moment, staring up at the empty oak tree. Listening to the silence.

Annie sighed. “Let’s go,” she said softly.

Jack just nodded. He felt too sad to speak. As they started walking, he put his hands into his pockets.

He felt something.

Jack pulled out the gold medallion. “Look!” he said. “How did—?”

Annie smiled. “Morgan must have put it there,” she said.

“But how?”

“Magic,” said Annie. “I think it means she’ll be coming back.”

Jack smiled. He clutched the medallion as he and Annie took off through the wet, sunny woods.

As they walked, the sun shined through the woods. And all the wet leaves sparkled.

Everything, in fact, was shining.

Leaves, branches, puddles, bushes, grass, vines, wild flowers—all glittered like jewels.

Or gleamed like gold.

Annie had been right, thought Jack.

Forget the treasure chest.

They had treasure at home. A ton of it. Everywhere.

“Let’s look again, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie were walking home from the library. The path went right by the Frog Creek woods.

Jack sighed. “We looked this morning,” he said. “We looked the day before. And the day before that.”

“Then you don’t have to come,” said Annie. “I’ll go look by myself.”

She took off into the woods.

“Annie, wait!” Jack called. “It’s almost dark! We have to get home!”

But Annie had disappeared among the trees.

Jack stared at the woods. He was starting to lose hope. Maybe he would never see Morgan again.

Weeks had passed. And there had not been one sign of Morgan le Fay. Nor had there been one sign of her magic tree house.

“Jack!” Annie called from the woods. “It’s back!”

Oh, she’s just pretending as usual, Jack thought. But his heart started to race.

“Hurry!” called Annie.

“She better not be kidding,” said Jack.

He took off into the woods to find Annie.

Night was falling fast. Crickets chirped loudly. It was hard to see through the shadows.

“Annie!” Jack shouted.

“Here!” she called.

Jack kept walking. “Here where?” he called back.

“Here here!”

Annie’s voice came from above.

Jack looked up.

“Oh man,” he breathed.

Annie waved from the window of a tree house. It was in the tallest oak in the woods. A long rope ladder hung down from it.

The magic tree house was back.

“Come on up!” Annie shouted.

Jack ran to the rope ladder. He started climbing.

He climbed and climbed and climbed.



As he climbed, he looked out over the woods. High above the treetops it was still light.

At last, Jack pulled himself into the tree house.

Annie sat in the shadows. Books were scattered everywhere.

On the floor the letter M glowed in the dim light. The M stood for Morgan le Fay.

But there was no sign of Morgan herself.

“I wonder where Morgan is,” said Jack.

“Maybe she went to the library to get some more books,” said Annie.

“We were just at the library. We would have seen her,” said Jack. “Besides, the library’s closed now.”

Squeak!

A little mouse ran out from behind a stack of books. It ran to the M shining in the floor.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

The mouse sat on the middle of the M. It looked up at Jack and Annie.

“Oh, it’s so cute,” Annie said.

Jack had to admit the mouse was cute. It had brown-and-white fur and big dark eyes.

Annie slowly reached out her hand. The mouse didn’t move. Annie patted its tiny head.

“Hi, Peanut,” she said. “Can I call you Peanut?”

“Oh brother,” said Jack.

“Do you know where Morgan is?” Annie asked the mouse.

Squeak.

“You’re nuts, Annie,” said Jack. “Just because the mouse is in the tree house doesn’t mean it’s magic. It’s a plain old mouse that crawled in, that’s all.”

Jack looked around again. He saw a piece of paper on the floor.

“What’s that?” he said.

“What’s what?” asked Annie.

Jack went over and picked up the paper. There was writing on it.

“Oh man,” whispered Jack, after he read the words.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“A note,” said Jack. “It must be from Morgan. I think she’s in big trouble!”

Book 5 Night of the Ninjas

Here’s what kids have to say to

Mary Pope Osborne, author of

the Magic Tree House series:

WOW! You have an imagination like no other.—Adam W.

I love your books. If you stop writing books, it will be like losing a best friend.—Ben M.

I think you are the real Morgan le Fay. There is always magic in your books.—Erica Y.

For Penn Sultan




One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to be there.

Jack and Annie visited the time of dinosaurs, old England, ancient Egypt, and a pirate ship.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She traveled through time and space, gathering books.





Jack and Annie are about to start a whole new adventure … in Night of the Ninjas.


1. Back into the Woods


“Let’s look again, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie were walking home from the library. The path went right by the Frog Creek woods.

Jack sighed. “We looked this morning,” he said. “We looked the day before. And the day before that.”

“Then you don’t have to come,” said Annie. “I’ll go look by myself.”

She took off into the woods.

“Annie, wait!” Jack called. “It’s almost dark! We have to get home!”

But Annie had disappeared among the trees.

Jack stared at the woods. He was starting to lose hope. Maybe he would never see Morgan again.

Weeks had passed. And there had not been one sign of Morgan le Fay. Nor had there been one sign of her magic tree house.

“Jack!” Annie called from the woods. “It’s back!”

Oh, she’s just pretending as usual, Jack thought. But his heart started to race.

“Hurry!” called Annie.

“She better not be kidding,” said Jack.

He took off into the woods to find Annie.

Night was falling fast. Crickets chirped loudly. It was hard to see through the shadows.

“Annie!” Jack shouted.

“Here!” she called.

Jack kept walking. “Here where?” he called back.

“Here here!”

Annie’s voice came from above.

Jack looked up.

“Oh man,” he breathed.

Annie waved from the window of a tree house. It was in the tallest oak in the woods. A long rope ladder hung down from it.

The magic tree house was back.

“Come on up!” Annie shouted.

Jack ran to the rope ladder. He started climbing.

He climbed and climbed and climbed.



As he climbed, he looked out over the woods. High above the treetops it was still light.

At last, Jack pulled himself into the tree house.

Annie sat in the shadows. Books were scattered everywhere.

On the floor the letter M glowed in the dim light. The M stood for Morgan le Fay.

But there was no sign of Morgan herself.

“I wonder where Morgan is,” said Jack.

“Maybe she went to the library to get some more books,” said Annie.

“We were just at the library. We would have seen her,” said Jack. “Besides, the library’s closed now.”

Squeak!

A little mouse ran out from behind a stack of books. It ran to the M shining in the floor.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

The mouse sat on the middle of the M. It looked up at Jack and Annie.

“Oh, it’s so cute,” Annie said.

Jack had to admit the mouse was cute. It had brown-and-white fur and big dark eyes.

Annie slowly reached out her hand. The mouse didn’t move. Annie patted its tiny head.

“Hi, Peanut,” she said. “Can I call you Peanut?”

“Oh brother,” said Jack.

“Do you know where Morgan is?” Annie asked the mouse.

Squeak.

“You’re nuts, Annie,” said Jack. “Just because the mouse is in the tree house doesn’t mean it’s magic. It’s a plain old mouse that crawled in, that’s all.”

Jack looked around again. He saw a piece of paper on the floor.

“What’s that?” he said.

“What’s what?” asked Annie.

Jack went over and picked up the paper. There was writing on it.

“Oh man,” whispered Jack, after he read the words.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“A note,” said Jack. “It must be from Morgan. I think she’s in big trouble!”


2. The Open Book


Jack showed Annie the piece of paper. It said:



“Oh no,” said Annie. “We have to help her. But what’s a thin?”

“Maybe she was trying to write things,” said Jack. “See how the n sort of runs off the page?”

“Maybe the spell was starting to make her disappear or something,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “I wonder if she left any other clues.” He glanced around the tree house.

“Look!” Annie pointed at a book in the corner. “That’s the only open book,” she said.

Jack looked around again. Annie was right. He felt a shiver go down his spine.

Jack went over to the book and picked it up. He held it near the window. Light from the setting sun was golden on the page.

Jack stared at the picture on it. In the picture were trees with white flowers. The trees were on the side of a mountain. Near a wide, rushing stream.

Two people were also in the picture. They wore dark clothes. They had black scarves over their faces. And long swords strapped to their backs.

“Oh man,” whispered Jack.

“Who are they?” Annie asked.

“Ninjas, I think,” said Jack.

“Ninjas? Really?” said Annie.

“Morgan must have left the book open to this page for a reason,” said Jack.

“Maybe that’s where she was when the spell got her,” Annie said.

“Or maybe that’s where the four things are,” said Jack.

“Let’s go!” said Annie.

“Now?” said Jack.

“Yes, Morgan’s in trouble! She needs us now!” said Annie.

“But we should read this book first,” said Jack. “So we’ll be prepared.”

“Forget it!” said Annie. “Every minute counts!” She grabbed the book from Jack.

“Give it back,” he said. “We have to find out about this place.”

Annie held the book out of reach. “We’ll find out when we get there,” she said.

“We don’t even know where there is!” Jack said.

But Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go here,” she said.

The leaves of the oak tree began to shake.

Squeak!

“Don’t be scared, Peanut,” said Annie. She scooped up the mouse. Then she put it in the pouch of her sweatshirt.

The wind began to blow.

It blew harder and harder.

The tree house started to spin.

Faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still. Absolutely still.

Except for the sound of rushing water.



3. E-hy!

Jack opened his eyes.

Annie was already looking out the window. The mouse peeked out of her pouch.

Jack looked out the window, too. The air was fresh and cool.

The tree house was in a tree with white flowers. The tree was in a grove of trees on the side of a mountain. Nearby a wild stream rushed downhill.

Two ninjas were standing on rocks near the water. They were staring at the valley below.

One ninja was tall. The other was short. They wore black pants and shirts. They had black scarves around their heads. And swords strapped to their backs.

It was exactly like the picture in the book.

Jack crouched below the window.

“Be careful,” he whispered. “Don’t let them see you.”

“Why not?” Annie whispered back.

“They might think we’re some kind of enemy,” said Jack quietly.

Annie crouched beside him.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. Now he was going to look at the ninja book.

He picked up the book. He turned to the beginning. He read:

Very little is known about the shadowy warriors called ninjas. Historians believe that ninjas lived in Japan between the 14th and 17th centuries. Both men and women were ninjas. Sometimes they fought to protect their families. Sometimes warlords hired them to be spies.



“Wow,” whispered Jack. “We’re in Japan, hundreds of years ago.”

Jack opened his backpack. He pulled out his notebook and pencil. He liked to take notes. He wrote:



“Jack,” whispered Annie. “They’re looking up. I think they know we’re here.”

Jack peeked over the windowsill. His eyes met the dark eyes of the tall ninja.

“E-hy!” the ninja cried. He dashed toward the tree. The other ninja followed.

“Oh no!” said Annie.

“We’ve got to go!” Jack said. “Where’s the Pennsylvania book?”

He and Annie looked around wildly.

But where was the book about Pennsylvania? It had the picture of the Frog Creek woods in it. Jack and Annie couldn’t get home without it.

“It’s not anywhere!” cried Annie.

“We’ve got to do something. Fast!” said Jack. “Pull up the ladder!”

He and Annie grabbed the top of the rope ladder. They pulled the ladder into the tree house.

But the tall ninja leaped at the tree trunk. Then he started climbing up the tree! The short ninja followed. They climbed just like cats!

Jack and Annie huddled in a corner.

The ninjas climbed into the tree house. Neither one made a sound.



4. Captured

The ninjas pulled iron bands off their hands. The bands had spikes like claws on them.

“That’s how they climbed the tree,” Annie whispered to Jack.

The ninjas stared at Jack and Annie with dark, piercing eyes. The rest of their faces were covered by their scarves.

Jack felt frozen under their stares.

Annie wasn’t frozen, though. She stepped right up to them.

“Hi,” she said.

The ninjas didn’t say “hi” back. They didn’t move at all. They were as still as Jack.

“We’re trying to help our friend, Morgan,” said Annie.

She held up Morgan’s note.

The tall ninja took the note from her. He looked at it. Then he gave it to the short ninja.

The two ninjas stared at each other. Then they looked back at Jack and Annie.

Finally the short ninja nodded once. He put the note into the pocket of his shirt.

“You can help us?” Annie asked.

Neither ninja spoke. Jack wished he could see their faces. He couldn’t tell what they were thinking.

The short ninja tossed the rope ladder back out of the tree house. The tall one pointed down the ladder. Then he pointed at Jack and Annie.

Uh-oh, thought Jack. Were they being captured?

“Us? Go with you?” said Annie.

The ninja nodded.

“Oh boy!” said Annie.

Oh boy? Is she nuts? wondered Jack.

The short ninja darted down the ladder. He went hand over hand. His feet didn’t touch the rungs of the ladder.

The tall one did the same.

Jack gasped. The ninjas moved very fast. They were like spiders dropping from webs.

“Wow!” said Annie.

“Now’s our chance to leave,” said Jack. “Quick!” He looked around the tree house again. Where was that Pennsylvania book?

“Let’s go with them, Jack,” said Annie.

“No! This isn’t a game!” Jack said.

“But I think they know something about Morgan!” said Annie.

She started down the ladder.

“Come back!” said Jack.

But it was too late.

Jack sighed. “Why does this always happen?” he asked himself.

“Come on, Jack!” came Annie’s voice from below.

Jack put his notebook and the ninja book into his pack. He pushed his glasses into place. And he started down the ladder.

Jack joined Annie and the ninjas on the ground.

The sun had fallen behind the hills. The sky was streaked with red and gold.

The mouse peeked out from Annie’s sweatshirt pouch.

“Don’t be scared, Peanut,” Annie whispered. “We’ll take care of you.”

Great, thought Jack. But who is going to take care of us?

The short ninja held Jack’s arm in one hand and Annie’s arm in the other. He led them through the twilight. The tall ninja walked behind them.

“Where are we going?” Jack asked.

The ninjas stopped near the rushing water of the wide stream. The water roared as it raced downhill.

The short ninja looked at Jack and Annie. He let go of their arms. Then he pushed them toward the stream.

“You want us to cross it?” shouted Annie.

The ninja nodded. Then he and the short ninja stepped into the wild stream. They started wading across.

“Let’s run back to the tree house!” said Jack.

“No, we have to follow them!” said Annie. “For Morgan’s sake!”

Jack took a deep breath. She was right.

Annie grabbed Jack’s hand. Together they stepped into the water.

“YIKES!” They both screamed and jumped out.

It was the coldest water Jack had ever felt! It was colder than ice. It was so cold it felt like fire.

“I can’t go back in,” said Annie, shivering.

“Me neither,” said Jack. “I’ll have a heart attack.”

The ninjas looked at Jack and Annie. Then they turned around and came back.

The tall ninja grabbed Jack.

“Help!” Jack cried.

But the ninja lifted Jack high into the air. And put him on his shoulder.



The short ninja put Annie on his shoulder.

Then the two ninjas stepped into the stream again. The icy wild waters swirled around them. It went up to the short ninja’s waist.

But the ninjas moved through the stream as calmly as two sailing ships.



5. Flames in the Mist

The water grew shallow again. Then they were on dry land. The ninjas lowered Jack and Annie to the ground.

“Thanks,” said Annie.

“Thanks,” said Jack.

Squeak, said the mouse.

The ninjas said nothing, but they looked around.

Jack looked around, too. A full moon was rising in the sky. Dark rocks dotted the side of the mountain.

Then the ninjas started moving. They went silently up the slope, between the rocks.

Jack and Annie followed them. Jack wasn’t afraid of the ninjas now. In fact, he was starting to like them. Maybe they really could help find Morgan.

The ninjas moved silently. But Jack and Annie made plenty of noise.

They panted as they climbed the rocky hillside. Their wet sneakers made squishy sounds.

Suddenly the ninjas froze. Jack could see their eyes darting around. Voices were coming from the valley below. Jack saw torches flaming in the mist.

The ninjas started moving faster. Jack and Annie hurried after them.

“Who’s carrying the torches?” Annie asked.

Jack was too out of breath to speak. He also didn’t have an answer.

They came to a pine forest. Night birds called out. Wind rattled the branches.

The ninjas moved like ghosts through the forest. They appeared and disappeared, through moonlight and shadows.

Jack and Annie struggled to keep up.

Finally the ninjas came to a stop.

One ninja held out his hand, as if to say, Wait. Then both ninjas stepped away into the shadows of the trees. And were gone.

“Where did they go?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book can tell us.”

He pulled the ninja book out of his pack.

He turned the pages until he came to a picture of a cave.

By the light of the full moon, he read:

Sometimes ninjas held meetings in hidden mountain caves to plan secret missions.



“Oh man,” said Jack, “I bet they went inside a hidden cave.”

He pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:



Jack turned the page. He stared at a picture of a ninja sitting on a mat. He read:

Ninjas took orders from a ninja master. The master was a mysterious wise person who knew many secrets of nature.



“Wow,” whispered Jack.

Just then the two ninjas returned. Jack quickly put his books away.

The short ninja motioned for Jack and Annie to follow. In the shadows was the entrance of a dark cave.

“What’s in there?” Annie whispered.

“The ninja master,” Jack whispered back.



6. Shadow Warrior

Jack and Annie went into the cave. They followed the ninja through the darkness.

The back of the cave was lit with dozens of candles. Shadows danced on the walls.

In the flickering light, Jack saw a dark figure sitting on a woven mat.

The ninja master.

The ninja bowed to the master. Then he stepped to one side.

The master stared at Jack and Annie.

“Sit,” he said.



Jack and Annie sat on the cold, hard floor.

Squeak.

The mouse poked its head out of Annie’s pouch.

“It’s okay, Peanut,” said Annie.

The master stared at the mouse for a moment. Then he looked at Jack. “Who are you?” he asked.

“I’m Jack and that’s my sister, Annie,” Jack answered.

“Where do you come from?” the master asked.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvania,” Annie answered.

“Why are you here?” he asked.

“We’re trying to help our friend Morgan le Fay,” said Jack. “She left us a message.”

Annie pointed to the short ninja. “We gave the message to him.”

“You mean, you gave the message to her,” said the ninja master. “And she has given it to me.”

“She?” said Jack and Annie together.

The woman ninja’s eyes sparkled. Jack thought she might be smiling.

The master held up Morgan’s note.

“Perhaps I can help you,” he said. “But first you must prove yourselves worthy of my help.”

Just then the tall ninja appeared. He made a sign to the master.

The master stood up. He handed Morgan’s note to Annie.

“We must go now,” he said. “The samurai are close.”

“Samurai?” said Jack. He knew that the samurai were fierce Japanese fighters.

“Were they the ones in the valley?” Jack asked. “The ones with the torches?”

“Yes, our family is at war with them,” said the master. “We must leave before they find us.”

“But what about helping Morgan?” said Annie.

The master strapped on his sword.

“I have no time now,” he said. “I must go.”

“Can’t we go with you?” said Annie.

“No, there is no place for you where we are going. You must find your way back to your house in the trees.”

“Alone?” said Jack.

“Yes. You must go alone. And beware of the samurai.”

“Why?” said Jack.

“They will think you are one of us,” said the master. “They will ask you no questions. They will show you no mercy.”

“Yikes,” whispered Annie.

“But you have seen the way of the ninja. You can practice it yourselves now,” said the master.

“H-how?” said Jack.

“Remember three things,” said the master.

“What?” said Jack.

“Use nature. Be nature. Follow nature.”

“I can do that!” Annie said.

Jack looked at her. “You can?” he said.

The master turned to Jack. “Your tree house lies to the east. That is the way you must go,” he said.

How? wondered Jack. How do we find the east?

Before he could ask, the master bowed. Then he disappeared into the shadows.

The two ninjas led Jack and Annie out of the cave, into the moonlight.

The tall one pointed at the pine forest. Then they too disappeared into the darkness.

Jack and Annie were all alone.



7. To the East

Jack and Annie stood still for a long moment.

Annie spoke first. “Well, I guess the tall ninja was pointing to the east,” she said. “I guess that’s the way we go.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “I need to write some stuff down.”

He took out his notebook. In the moonlight, he wrote:



Look, Jack,” whispered Annie. “Do I look like a ninja?”

He looked at her. She had pulled her sweatshirt hood over her head and tied the strings tightly.

She did look like a ninja—a very small one.

“Good idea,” Jack whispered. He pulled his hood up, too.

“Okay, let’s go,” said Annie.

Jack put his notebook away. Then he and Annie headed east into the woods.

They slipped between trees. And more trees. And more trees.

All the trees looked the same. Jack got confused. Were they still going in the right direction?

“Wait,” he said.

Annie stopped. They both stared at the woods around them.

“Do you think we’re still going east?” asked Jack.

“I guess so,” said Annie.

“We can’t just guess,” said Jack. “We have to know for sure.”

“How do we do that?” said Annie. “We don’t have a compass.”

Just then the master’s words came back to Jack.

“The ninja master said to use nature,” he said.

“How do we do that?” said Annie.

“Wait, I remember something—” Jack closed his eyes.

He remembered something in a camping book. Now what was it?

He opened his eyes. “I’ve got it! First we need a stick,” he said.

Annie picked up a stick. “Here—” she said.

“Great, now we just need a space with moonlight,” said Jack.

“There—” said Annie.

They moved into a moonlit space between the shadows.

“Now push the stick into the ground,” Jack said.

Annie pushed the stick into the ground.

“The stick’s shadow looks like it’s more than six inches,” said Jack. “What do you think?”

“It looks like it,” said Annie.

“Okay. Then that means the shadow’s pointing east,” said Jack.

“Neat,” said Annie.

“So that way is east!” Jack pointed to a new direction. “At least I hope it is.”

“We’re real ninjas now!” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. “Maybe we are. Come on!”

They took off—heading east, they hoped.

Soon they were out of the pine woods and walking down the rocky mountainside. They moved slowly from rock to rock. Finally they rested against a giant rock.

“Let’s check our direction again,” said Jack.

Annie stuck another stick into the dirt.

“There,” he said. He pointed to the shadow on the ground. “That way—”

Annie peeked over the rock, down the mountain.

“Yikes,” she said softly.

Jack looked, too. His heart nearly stopped.

There were flames of fire coming up the mountain. The samurai!

Jack and Annie ducked behind the rock.

Squeak, said the mouse.

“Quiet, Peanut,” said Annie.

Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the ninja book.

“I hope something in here can help us,” he said.

Jack flipped through page after page until he found what he was looking for. It was a picture of warriors wearing bamboo armor. They were holding swords. He read:

The samurai were fierce Japanese fighters. They carried two swords to cut down their enemies.



Annie tapped Jack on the shoulder.

Jack looked at her.

She pointed up the mountain.

A figure was coming down toward them. He was very near.

In the moonlight, his bamboo armor was shining. His two swords were gleaming.

It was a samurai warrior!



8. Dragon Water

Jack and Annie crouched together. Samurai were on both sides of them now. They were trapped!

Jack pressed against the rock.

The warrior stepped closer and closer. He looked to the right. He looked to the left.

Jack held his breath.

“Be nature,” whispered Annie.

“What?” Jack whispered back.

“Be nature. Be a rock.”

Oh brother, thought Jack. This was nuts. But he squeezed his eyes shut. Then he tried to be part of the rock.

Jack tried to be as still as the rock. As solid as the rock. As quiet as the rock.

Soon he started feeling as strong as the rock. As safe as the rock. He wanted to be the rock forever.

Squeak.

“He’s gone,” said Annie. “They’re all gone.”

Jack opened his eyes. The samurai warrior was gone. Jack stood up and looked over the rock. The torches were gone, too.

“Let’s go,” Annie said.

Jack took a deep breath. He felt great—he was getting more and more like a ninja every minute. Maybe even like a ninja master.

“East!” he said.

And they went east. Down the mountain, between the rocks. Until they came to the wide, icy stream.

The water seemed even wilder than before.

“I don’t see the tree house,” said Annie.

Jack looked across the stream to the dark grove of trees. Moonlight shone on their pale flowers. But where was the tree house?

“I don’t see it either,” said Jack. “We have to cross the water first. Then we’ll try and find it.”

The water was crashing and rushing over the rocks.

Squeak. The mouse peeked out from its pouch.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. She patted the mouse’s little head. “Be like us. Be like a ninja, too.”

“Let’s go,” Jack said.

He took a deep breath and stepped into the stream. The icy water swirled up to his knees. The current knocked him over.

Jack grabbed some weeds. He held on tight as water swirled around him.

He was freezing to death!

“Jack!” Annie grabbed Jack’s arms. She helped him back onto the bank.



“That was close!” said Annie.

Jack wiped his glasses. Luckily, they hadn’t fallen off in the water.

“Are you okay?” said Annie.

“N-not really,” said Jack, his teeth chattering. He was chilled to the bone.

“We’ll never get across,” said Annie.

“We’ll drown if we try.”

“Or fr-freeze to death,” said Jack.

He pulled off the hood of his sweatshirt. He didn’t feel much like a ninja anymore.

Annie pulled off her hood, too. She sighed. “What can we do?” she said.

Squeak.

Peanut climbed out of Annie’s sweatshirt pouch and leaped onto the ground.

The mouse scampered away.

“Peanut, come back!” Annie called.

“No,” said Jack. “We have to follow Peanut.”

“Why?” asked Annie.

“We have to do what the master said!” said Jack. “Follow nature!”

“Oh. Right!” said Annie. “Follow Peanut! But where is Peanut?”

In the moonlight Jack saw the little mouse. It was running through the grass along the stream.

“There!” he cried. “Come on!”

Annie hurried after Jack. Jack hurried after Peanut. They ran beside the rushing waters.

A moonlit branch had fallen across a narrow part of the stream. It touched both shores.

The mouse was running over the branch.

“Peanut’s going over a bridge!” said Annie. She started to follow.

“Wait!” cried Jack. “We can’t go on that branch. It’s too small! It’ll break!”



9. Mouse-walk

The mouse vanished into the tall grass on the other side of the stream.

Jack and Annie stared at the tree branch.

“We have to try to cross it,” said Annie. “We’re supposed to follow nature.”

“Forget it,” said Jack. “It’s too little. It’ll crack in a second.”

“Maybe if we pretend we’re mice, we can do it,” said Annie.

“Oh brother,” said Jack. “Not again.”

“If you could be a rock, you can be a mouse,” said Annie. “Just be teeny and light and fast.”

Jack took a deep breath.

“We have to,” said Annie.

“Okay,” Jack said.

“Say ‘squeak,’ ” said Annie.

“You’re nuts!” said Jack.

“Just do it,” said Annie. “It’ll help you feel more like a mouse.”

Jack groaned. “Okay,” he said. “Squeak.”

“Squeak,” said Annie.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak,” they said together.

“Let’s go! Hurry!” said Annie.

Jack stepped onto the branch.

I’m teeny. I’m light. I’m fast, he thought. Then he darted across the branch.

Jack moved so quickly, he didn’t think about anything—except getting to the other side.

He forgot the wild, freezing water. He forgot the smallness of the branch.

Suddenly Jack was on the other side. Suddenly Annie was right beside him.

They laughed and fell together into the grass.

“See! See! The branch didn’t break!” said Annie.

“I guess it was big enough,” said Jack. “I guess we just had to think the right way.”

“The Peanut way,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling. He felt great.

He was still wet from his fall into the stream. But he didn’t mind anymore.

Jack pushed his glasses into place and stood up. “Okay, now we just have to find the tree house,” he said.

“No, we don’t,” said Annie. She pointed up.

The tree house was outlined against the moonlit sky. High in a tree. Surrounded by white flowers.

In the distance came the sound of voices. Then Jack saw flames.

“The samurai are coming back,” said Jack. “We have to go.”

“Where’s Peanut?” said Annie. “We can’t leave Peanut.”

“We have to,” said Jack.

The voices of the samurai were getting closer. So were their torches.

“Come on,” Jack said. He grabbed Annie’s hand. He pulled her toward the rope ladder.

“Oh Jack—” she said sadly.

“Go! Go!”

Annie started up the rope ladder.

Jack followed. He felt sad, too. He liked that little mouse now. He liked it a lot.

They climbed up and up.

Just before they got to the top, Jack heard it.

Squeak.

“Oh wow!” cried Annie. “Peanut’s inside!”

Annie pulled herself into the tree house. Jack followed.

He gasped.

Someone else was in the tree house, too.

A dark figure was sitting in the corner.

“You have done well,” the figure said.

It was the ninja master.

“You have followed the way of the ninja,” he said.

“Oh man,” breathed Jack.

Squeak.

The master was holding Peanut.

“Take good care of your little helper,” he said, handing the mouse to Annie.

Annie kissed the mouse’s tiny head.

“And take this—” said the master. He held his hand out to Jack.

He gave Jack a small, round stone.



“This moonstone will help you find your missing friend,” the master said.

Jack stared at the stone. Was this one of the four things?

“You must go home now,” said the master. He picked up the Pennsylvania book and handed it to Annie.

“Where did you find it?” asked Jack.

“Here,” said the master. “You did not see it before. Because your heart knew you had a mission to complete first.”

“What about you?” said Annie. “Can you come with us?”

“Yes,” said Jack. “We need help finding Morgan.”

The master smiled. “No, my friends. I must stay here. There will be more help along the way. But you must find the way on your own.”

Annie opened the book. She found the picture of Frog Creek.

She pointed to it. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The white flowers started to shake. Clouds covered the moon.

“Remember,” the master said, “keep a kind heart.”

Then he swung silently down the rope ladder. He disappeared into the dark night.

“Wait!” Jack called. There was so much he wanted to ask the master. About nature. About ninjas. About their mission.

But the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Jack gripped the stone in his hand. He squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Night, Peanut

Jack opened his eyes.

Then he opened his fist. He stared at the moonstone in his hand. It was clear and smooth. It almost seemed to glow.

“We’re home,” said Annie.

Squeak.

Annie and the mouse were looking out the window.

Jack looked with them.

The sun was setting in the distance.

No time at all had passed in Frog Creek.

They heard their neighbor’s dog, Henry, bark. They heard crickets chirping.

In the distance, they could see their dad step out of their house. He stood on their porch.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” he called.

Time for dinner.

“Com-ing!” Annie shouted.

Jack sat back on his heels. He looked at the moonstone again.

“I guess we have one of the four things,” he said.

“We’ll look for the other three tomorrow,” Annie said.

Jack nodded. They had a lot more work to do.

He put the moonstone in his pocket.

He pulled on his pack.

“Ready?” he said.

“Wait,” said Annie. She took off one of her sneakers. She pulled off her sock. Then she put her sneaker back on.

“What are you doing?” said Jack.

“I’m making a bed,” she said.

“A what?”

“Bed! You know, for Peanut to sleep in.” Annie picked up the mouse. She tucked it inside her sock.

“’Night, Peanut,” she said softly.

Squeak.

“Oh brother,” said Jack.

Annie held the mouse close to Jack.

“Kiss it goodnight, Jack,” she said.

“Don’t be silly,” he said. “Let’s go.”

“Thanks for helping us,” Annie said to the mouse.



She put Peanut gently down on the glowing M. She pulled Morgan’s message out of her pouch. And put it next to the mouse.

“See you tomorrow,” she said. Then she started down the ladder.

Jack stared at the mouse. It looked back at him.

For a moment, its dark eyes looked old and wise.

“Come on, Jack!” called Annie.

Jack kissed its tiny head.

“Night-night, Peanut,” he whispered.

Then Jack headed down the rope ladder.

It got darker and darker as he went down.

By the time he stepped onto the ground, it was almost completely black.

“Where are you?” said Jack.

“Here,” said Annie. Her hand bumped his. He took it.

“Careful,” he said.

“Careful yourself,” she said.

Together they took off through the cool, dark woods.

They moved silently and swiftly—two shadow warriors returning home.

“Hurry, Jack!” shouted Annie.

Annie ran into the Frog Creek woods.

Jack followed her.

“It’s still here!” Annie called.

Jack caught up with Annie. She stood beside a tall oak tree.

Jack looked up. The magic tree house was shining in the afternoon sunlight.

“We’re coming, Peanut!” Annie called.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

Jack followed. They climbed and climbed. Finally they climbed into the tree house.

“Peanut?” said Annie.

Jack took off his backpack. He looked around.

Sunlight slanted across a stack of books—books about ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

The letter M shimmered on the wooden floor. M for Morgan le Fay.

“I don’t think Peanut’s here,” said Jack.

“I wonder where she is,” said Annie.

“How do you know Peanut’s a she?” asked Jack.

“I just know it,” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

Squeak!

Annie laughed. “Look, Jack!”

A small pink sock was moving across the floor. Yesterday Annie had turned her sock into a bed for Peanut.



Annie picked up the tiny lump.

Squeak.

A brown-and-white mouse peeked out of the sock. She looked from Annie to Jack with her big eyes.

Jack laughed. “Hi, Peanut,” he said.

“Will you help us again today?” asked Annie.

In old Japan, Peanut had helped them when they’d gotten lost.

“We have to find three more things for Morgan,” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “First we have to find a clue that tells us where to begin,” he said.

“Guess what,” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“We don’t have to look very far.” She pointed at a corner of the tree house.

In the shadows was an open book.

For Piers Pope Boyce





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Jack and Annie visited the times of dinosaurs, knights, pyramids, pirates, and ninjas. Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In their last adventure, Night of the Ninjas, Jack and Annie learned that Morgan was under a spell. To free her, Jack and Annie have to find four special things.

In old Japan, they found the first thing: a moonstone.

Now Jack and Annie are about to set out in search of the second thing … in Afternoon on the Amazon.



1. Where’s Peanut?

“Hurry, Jack!” shouted Annie.

Annie ran into the Frog Creek woods.

Jack followed her.

“It’s still here!” Annie called.

Jack caught up with Annie. She stood beside a tall oak tree.

Jack looked up. The magic tree house was shining in the afternoon sunlight.

“We’re coming, Peanut!” Annie called.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

Jack followed. They climbed and climbed. Finally they climbed into the tree house.

“Peanut?” said Annie.

Jack took off his backpack. He looked around.

Sunlight slanted across a stack of books—books about ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

The letter M shimmered on the wooden floor. M for Morgan le Fay.

“I don’t think Peanut’s here,” said Jack.

“I wonder where she is,” said Annie.

“How do you know Peanut’s a she?” asked Jack.

“I just know it,” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

Squeak!

Annie laughed. “Look, Jack!”

A small pink sock was moving across the floor. Yesterday Annie had turned her sock into a bed for Peanut.



Annie picked up the tiny lump.

Squeak.

A brown-and-white mouse peeked out of the sock. She looked from Annie to Jack with her big eyes.

Jack laughed. “Hi, Peanut,” he said.

“Will you help us again today?” asked Annie.

In old Japan, Peanut had helped them when they’d gotten lost.

“We have to find three more things for Morgan,” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “First we have to find a clue that tells us where to begin,” he said.

“Guess what,” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“We don’t have to look very far.” She pointed at a corner of the tree house.

In the shadows was an open book.



2. Big Bugs

“Wow,” said Jack, picking up the book. “The ninja book was open yesterday. Now this one. Who opened them?”

Jack closed the book and looked at the cover.

It showed a picture of a green forest. The trees were very tall and close together.

On the cover were the words The Rain Forest.

“Oh, wow,” said Jack.

“Oh, no,” said Annie.

“What’s wrong?” said Jack.

“I learned about the rain forest in school,” said Annie. “It’s filled with big bugs and spiders.”

“I know,” said Jack. “Half of them have never even been named.”

“It’s creepy,” said Annie.

“It’s neat,” said Jack. He wanted to take lots of notes in the rain forest. Maybe he could even name some unknown bugs.

“Neat? Yuk,” said Annie. She shivered.

“I don’t get it,” said Jack. “You weren’t afraid of dinosaurs.”

“So?”

“You weren’t afraid of the castle guards or the mummy’s ghost.”

“So?”

“You weren’t afraid of pirates or ninjas.”

“So?”

“You’re not afraid of really scary things. But you’re afraid of little bugs and spiders. That doesn’t make sense.”

“So?”

Jack sighed. “Listen,” he said. “We have to go there. To help Morgan. That’s why the book was left open.”

“I know that,” said Annie, frowning.

“Plus, the rain forests are being cut down,” said Jack. “Don’t you want to see one before it’s too late?”

Annie took a deep breath and slowly nodded.

“Okay, then, let’s go,” said Jack.

He opened the book again. He pointed to a picture that showed blue sky, green leaves, and bright flowers.



“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

Squeak.

“Stay here, Peanut,” said Annie as she put the mouse in her pocket.

The wind picked up. The tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The wind was whistling now. The tree house was spinning faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Wild sounds broke the silence.

Screeeeeech!

Buzzzzzzz!

Chirp! Chirp!



3. Yikes!

Jack opened his eyes.

The air was hot and steamy.

“It looks like we landed in some bushes,” said Annie.

She was peeking out of the tree house window. Peanut was peeking out of Annie’s pocket.

Jack peeked out of the tree house, too.

They had landed in a sea of shiny green leaves. Outside there were flowers, bright butterflies, and birds. Just as in the book.

“That’s strange,” said Jack. “I wonder why we didn’t land in a tree. The way we always do.”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But let’s hurry and find the thing for Morgan. So we can get back home before we meet any big bugs.”

“Wait. This seems weird,” said Jack. “I don’t understand why we landed in bushes. I’d better read about this.”

“Oh, come on,” said Annie. “We don’t even need the ladder. We can just climb out the window.”

Annie put Peanut in her pocket. She stuck one leg out the window.

“Wait!” Jack grabbed Annie’s other leg. He read:

The rain forest is in three layers. Thick treetops, often over 150 feet in the air, make up the top layer. This is called the forest canopy. Below the canopy is the understory, then the forest floor.





“Get back in here!” cried Jack. “We’re probably more than 150 feet above the ground! In the forest canopy!”



“Yikes!” said Annie. She slipped back into the tree house.

“We have to use the ladder,” said Jack. He got on his hands and knees. He moved leaves away from the hole in the floor. He looked down.

The ladder seemed to fall between the branches of a giant tree. But Jack couldn’t see beyond that.

“I can’t tell what’s down there,” he said. “Be careful.”

Jack put the rain forest book in his backpack. Then he stepped onto the rope ladder.

He started down. Annie followed with Peanut in her pocket.

Jack pushed through the leaves.

He came to the understory below the canopy.

He looked down at the forest floor. It was very far away.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

This world was completely different from the one above the treetops.

Now that they were out of the sun, it was cooler. It was also damp and very quiet.

Jack shivered. It was the spookiest place he had ever seen.



4. Millions of Them!

Jack didn’t move. He kept staring down at the forest floor.

“What’s wrong?” Annie called from above.

Jack didn’t answer.

“You don’t see any giant spiders, do you?” Annie said.

“Well … no.” Jack took a deep breath.

We have to keep going, he thought. We have to find the special thing for Morgan.

“No spiders. Nothing scary,” Jack called. And he started down the ladder again.

Jack and Annie climbed down through the understory. Finally they stepped onto the forest floor.

Only a few rays of light slanted through the gloom.

The trees were very, very tall and very wide. Vines and moss were hanging everywhere. The ground was covered with dead leaves.

“Before we do anything, I’d better check the book,” said Jack.

He pulled out the rain forest book. He found a picture of the dark world under the treetops.

He read:

In the rain forest, many living creatures blend in with their surroundings. This is called camouflage.



“Oh, man,” said Jack. He closed the book and looked around. “There’re tons of creatures down here. We just can’t see them.”

“Really?” whispered Annie.

She and Jack peered around at the quiet forest. Jack felt unseen eyes watching them.

“Let’s hurry and find the special thing,” whispered Annie.

“How will we know when we find it?” Jack said.

“I think we’ll just know,” said Annie. She headed off through the gloom.

Jack followed. They crept between the huge trees and past hanging vines.

Annie stopped. “Wait—what’s that?”

“What’s what?”

“Listen—that weird sound.”

Jack listened. He heard a crackling sound. It sounded like a person walking over leaves.

Jack looked around. He didn’t see anyone.

But the sound got louder.

Was it an animal? A giant bug? One that had never been named?

Just then the silent forest came alive.

Birds took off into the air. Frogs hopped over the leaves. Lizards ran up the tree trunks.

The weird noise grew louder and louder.

“Maybe the book explains it,” said Jack. He opened the book. He found a picture of different animals running together. He read:

When animals hear a crackling sound, they flee in panic. The sound means that 30 million flesh-eating army ants are marching through the dead leaves.





“It’s army ants!” cried Jack. “Millions of them!”

“Where?” cried Annie.

Jack and Annie looked around wildly.

“There!” Annie pointed.



Army ants—millions and millions of them—were marching over the leaves!

“Run to the tree house!” cried Annie.

“Where is it?” said Jack, whirling around. All the trees looked the same. Where was the rope ladder?

“Just run!” cried Annie.

Jack and Annie took off.

They ran over the dead leaves.

They ran between wide tree trunks.

They ran past the hanging vines and mosses.

They climbed over thick roots.

Jack saw a clearing ahead. It was filled with sunlight.

“That way!” he cried.

Jack and Annie hurried toward the light. They pushed their way through the bushes.

They burst onto the bank of a river.

They stared at the slow-moving brown water.

“Do you think the ants will come this way?” Annie said, panting.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “But if we wade a few feet into the river, we’re safe. The ants won’t go into the water. Come on.”

“Look!” said Annie.

She pointed to a big log rocking at the edge of the river. The inside of the log was dug out.

“It looks like a canoe,” said Jack. He listened to the crackling sound in the distance. “Let’s get in it. Quick!”

Jack shoved the book into his backpack. Then he and Annie carefully climbed into the dugout log.

Annie leaned out of it. She pushed away from the bank with her hands.

“Wait!” said Jack. “We don’t have paddles!”

“Oops,” said Annie.

The canoe started moving slowly down the muddy river.



5. Pretty Fish

Squeak.

Annie patted the little mouse in her pocket.

“It’s okay, Peanut. The ants can’t get us in the river. We’re safe,” she said.

“Maybe safe from the ants,” said Jack. “But where is this canoe going?”

Jack and Annie stared at the river. Branches spread over the water. Vines and mosses hung down from them.

“We’d better look this up,” said Jack. He pulled the rain forest book out of his backpack and flipped through it.

Soon he found a picture of a river. He read:

The Amazon River stretches over 4,000 miles from the mountains of Peru, across Brazil, to the Atlantic Ocean. The river basin contains over half of the rain forests in the world.



Jack looked at Annie. “We’re on the Amazon River,” he said. “It’s more than four thousand miles long!”

“Wow,” Annie whispered. She looked at the river. She trailed her hand through the water.

“I have to make some notes—” Jack said. He pulled his notebook out of his pack. He wrote:



“Jack, look at those pretty fish with the teeth,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack glanced up from his writing.

Annie was pointing at some blue fish swimming near the boat. The fish had red bellies and razor-sharp teeth.

“Watch it!” cried Jack. “Those aren’t pretty fish. They’re piranhas! They’ll eat anything! Even people!”

“Yikes,” whispered Annie.

“We better get back on shore,” said Jack, putting the books in his backpack.

“How?” said Annie. “We can’t go in the water now. And we don’t have any paddles.”

Jack tried to stay calm. “We need a plan,” he said.

Jack stared at the river. The canoe would soon float under some vines.

“I’ll grab a vine,” said Jack. “And pull us to shore.”

“Good idea,” said Annie.

As they glided under the branches, Jack stood up.

The canoe rocked. He nearly fell out.

“Balance the canoe,” said Jack.

Annie leaned to one side. Jack reached—he missed!

The canoe floated under more branches.

Jack reached for another thick vine.

He grabbed it!

It was cold and scaly. It wiggled and jerked!



“Ahhh!” Jack screamed and fell back into the canoe.

The vine was alive!

It was a long green snake!

The snake fell from the tree. It splashed into the water and swam away.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

He and Annie stared in horror at each other.

“What now?” said Annie, making a face.

“Well … ” Jack looked at the river. There were no vines up ahead. But there was a big branch floating on the water.

“Grab that branch near you,” said Jack. “Maybe we can use it for a paddle.”

The canoe floated closer to the branch. Annie reached for it.

Suddenly the branch rose into the air!

It was a crocodile!

“Help!” screamed Annie, and she fell back into the canoe.

The crocodile opened and closed its huge, long jaws. Then it moved past the canoe and swam up the river.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

A screeching sound split the air.

Jack and Annie jumped.

“Help!” said Jack.

He expected to see another terrible creature.

But all he saw was a small brown monkey, hanging by its tail from a tree.



6. Monkey Trouble

Squeak! Squeak! Peanut poked her head out from Annie’s pocket. She seemed to be yelling at the monkey.

“Don’t worry, Peanut,” said Annie. “He’s just a little monkey. He won’t hurt us.”

But suddenly the monkey grabbed a big red fruit hanging from the tree. He hurled it at the canoe.

“Watch it!” shouted Jack.

The fruit fell into the water with a splash.

The monkey screeched even louder.

He grabbed another fruit.



“Don’t throw things at us!” shouted Annie.

But the monkey hurled the red fruit right at them.

Jack and Annie ducked again. And the fruit splashed into the water.

“Stop that!” Annie shouted.

But the monkey only waved his arms and screeched again.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. “I don’t believe this.”

The monkey grabbed a third fruit and hurled it at Jack and Annie. It landed inside the canoe with a thump.

Annie grabbed the fruit. She stood up and threw it back at the monkey.

She missed. The canoe rocked. Annie almost fell out.

The monkey screeched even louder.

“Go away!” Annie shouted. “You’re the meanest thing in the world!”

The monkey stopped screeching.

He looked at Annie. Then he swung away. Into the forest.

“I think I hurt his feelings,” said Annie.

“Who cares?” said Jack. “He shouldn’t throw things.”

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “It’s raining now.”

“What?” Jack looked up. A raindrop hit him in the eye.

“Oh, no. I don’t believe this,” Jack said.

“What’d you expect?” said Annie. “It is the rain forest.”

A gust of wind blew the canoe.

Thunder rolled in the sky.

“A river’s a bad place to be in a storm,” said Jack. “We have to get back to shore. Right now.”

“But how?” said Annie. “We can’t wade or swim. The piranhas, the snake, and the crocodile will get us.”

Screeching split the air again.

“Oh, no,” said Jack. The bratty monkey was back.

This time, the monkey was pointing a long stick at the canoe.

Jack crouched down. Was the monkey going to hurl the stick at them? Like a spear?

Annie jumped up and faced the monkey.

“Watch it! He’s nuts,” said Jack.

But the monkey just stared at Annie. And Annie just stared back at him.

After a long moment, the monkey seemed to smile.

Annie smiled back.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“He wants to help us,” Annie said.

“Help us how?” said Jack.

The monkey held out the long stick.

Annie grabbed the other end.

The monkey pulled on the stick. The canoe started floating toward him.

The monkey pulled the canoe all the way to the bank of the river.



7. Freeze!

Jack and Annie jumped out of the canoe.

The rain was starting to fall harder.

The monkey took off. He swung from tree to tree, heading up the riverbank.

He screeched and beckoned to Jack and Annie.

“He wants us to follow him!” said Annie.

“No! We have to find the special thing. Then go home!” said Jack.

“He wants to help us!” said Annie. She took off after the monkey.

The two of them vanished into the rain forest.

“Annie!”

Thunder shook the sky.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

He dashed after Annie and the monkey. Into the dark forest.

The forest seemed surprisingly dry.

Jack looked up. It was still raining. But the treetops acted like a huge umbrella.

“Annie?” called Jack.

“Jack! Jack!” cried Annie.

“Where are you?”

“Here!”

Jack hurried in the direction of Annie’s voice.

Soon he found the monkey. He was screeching and swinging from a tree.

Annie was kneeling on the forest floor. She was playing with an animal that looked like a giant kitten.

“What’s that?” Jack said.

“I don’t know, but I love it!” said Annie.

Annie batted the animal’s paws. It had gold fur and black spots.

“I’d better find out what it is,” said Jack. He pulled out the rain forest book and flipped through it.

“Oh, it’s so cute,” said Annie.

Jack found a picture of an animal with gold fur and black spots. He read:

The jaguar is the biggest predator in the western hemisphere.



“Forget cute,” Jack said. “That must be a baby jaguar. It’s going to grow up and be the biggest predator in—”

“What’s a predator?” asked Annie.

GRRR! There was a terrible growl.

Jack whirled around.



The mother jaguar was coming out from behind a tree. She was creeping over the dead leaves—right toward Annie.

“Freeze!” whispered Jack.

Annie froze. But the jaguar kept moving slowly toward her.

“Help,” said Jack weakly.

Suddenly the monkey swooped down from his tree. He grabbed the jaguar’s tail!

The cat roared and spun around.

Annie jumped up.

The monkey pulled the jaguar’s tail again. Then he let go and took off.

The jaguar sprang after him.

“Run, Annie!” cried Jack.

Jack and Annie took off through the rain forest. They ran for their lives!



8. Vampire Bats?

“Wait—” said Jack, panting. “I think we got away.”

Jack and Annie stopped running and caught their breath.

“Where are we?” said Jack.

“Where’s the monkey?” said Annie, looking back at the forest. “Do you think the jaguar caught him?”

“No, monkeys are fast,” said Jack.

Of course, jaguars are fast, too, Jack thought. But he didn’t want to tell Annie that.

“I hope he’s okay,” said Annie.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of Annie’s pocket.

“Peanut! I almost forgot you!” said Annie. “Are you okay?”

The mouse just stared at Annie with her big eyes.

“She looks scared,” said Jack. “Poor Peanut.”

“Poor monkey,” said Annie. She looked around at the forest.

“We’d better check the book,” Jack said.

He pulled out the book. He turned the pages, searching for help.

He stopped at a picture of a scary creature.

“Oh, man. What’s this?” he said.

Jack read the writing below the picture. It said:

Vampire bats live in the Amazon rain forest. At night, they quietly bite their victims and suck their blood.



“Vampire bats?” said Jack. He felt faint.

“Vampire bats?” said Annie.

Jack nodded. “After dark.”

Annie and Jack looked around. The rain forest seemed to be getting even darker.

“Yikes,” said Annie. She looked at Jack. “Maybe we should go home.”

Jack nodded. For once he agreed with her.

“But what about our mission?” said Annie. “What about Morgan?”

“We’ll come back,” said Jack. “We’ll have to be prepared.”

“So we’ll come back tomorrow?” Annie asked.

“Right. Now which way is the tree house?” said Jack.

“This way,” said Annie, pointing.

“That way,” said Jack, pointing in the opposite direction.

They looked at each other. “We’re lost,” they said together.

Squeak.

“Don’t worry, Peanut.” Annie started to pat the mouse again. But then she stopped.

Squeak. Squeak. Squeak.

“Jack, I think Peanut wants to help us,” said Annie.

“How?”

“The way she helped us in the time of ninjas—”

Annie placed the mouse on the leafy forest floor. “Take us to the tree house, Peanut.”

The mouse took off.

“Where’d she go?” said Annie. “I don’t see her!”

“There!” said Jack. He pointed to leaves rustling on the ground.

A streak of white passed over the leaves.

“Yes, there!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie followed the moving leaves. The streak of white appeared. And disappeared.

Suddenly Jack stopped.

The forest floor was still. There was no sign of Peanut.

“Where is she?” asked Jack.

He kept staring at the ground.

“Jack!”

Jack glanced around. Annie was standing on the other side of a nearby tree. She was pointing up.

Jack looked up.



The tree house.

“Oh, whew,” Jack said softly.

“She saved us again,” said Annie. “She’s running up the ladder. All by herself. Look.”

Annie pointed at the rope ladder.

Peanut was climbing up one of the ropes.

“Let’s go,” Jack said.

Annie started up the ladder. Then Jack.

They followed Peanut all the way up to the canopy of the rain forest.



9. The Thing

Jack and Annie climbed into the tree house.

Peanut was sitting on a stack of books.

Annie patted Peanut’s little head. “Thanks,” she said softly.

“I have to write some notes about the rain forest,” said Jack. “You find the Pennsylvania book.”

Annie began searching for the Pennsylvania book—the book that always took them home.

Jack pulled out his notebook.

He had wanted to take lots of notes here. But all he’d written so far was:



“It’s not here!” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked up. He glanced around the tree house.

Annie was right. The Pennsylvania book was nowhere in sight.

“Was it here before we left home?” said Jack.

“I don’t remember,” said Annie.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “Now we can’t get back to Frog Creek.”

“That means we’ll be here when the vampire bats come out,” said Annie.

Something came flying through the tree house window.

“Ahhh!” Jack and Annie hid their heads.

Thud.

Something hit the floor. A red fruit.

Jack looked up. The monkey was sitting in the window. His head was cocked to one side. He seemed to be grinning at them.

“You’re safe!” said Annie.

“Thanks for saving us,” said Jack.

The monkey just grinned.

“I have just one question,” said Annie. She pointed at the fruit. “Why do you keep throwing those at us?”

The monkey grabbed the fruit.

“No! Don’t throw it!” said Jack. He ducked.

But the monkey didn’t throw the fruit.

He held it out to Annie. He moved his lips as if he were trying to say something.



Annie stared into the monkey’s eyes. He moved his lips again.

“Wow,” Annie said softly. “I understand now.”

“Understand what?” said Jack.

Annie took the fruit from the monkey. “This is it,” she said. “The thing we need.”

“What thing?” said Jack.

“One of the special things we’re supposed to find for Morgan,” Annie said. “To free her from the spell.”

“Are you sure?” said Jack.

Before Annie could answer, Jack saw the Pennsylvania book. “Look! Our book!” he said, pointing.

“We found the thing. And now we can see the book,” said Annie. “That’s the way it works, remember?”

Jack nodded. Now he remembered. The ninja master said they wouldn’t be able to find the Pennsylvania book until they had found what they were looking for.

The monkey screeched with laughter.

Jack and Annie looked at him. He was clapping his hands together.

Annie laughed with him. “How did you know to give this to us?” she said. “Who told you to do that?”

The monkey just waved at Jack and Annie. Then he turned and swung away out of the tree house.

“Wait!” said Jack, looking out the window.

Too late.

The monkey was gone. He had vanished below the treetops.

“Good-bye!” called Annie.

A happy screech came from the mysterious world below.

Jack sighed. He picked up his notebook again. He looked at his writing:



He had to write something before they left. He quickly added—



Jack put away his notebook. Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book.

“Now it’s really time to leave,” she said.

She turned to the picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there,” she said, pointing at the picture.

The wind started to blow.

The leaves began to tremble.

The tree house began to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Halfway There

Squeak.

Jack opened his eyes. Peanut was on the tree house windowsill.

“We’re home,” said Annie.

Jack breathed a sigh of relief.

Annie held the fruit up to the afternoon light.

“What exactly is this?” she asked.

“Maybe it’s in the book,” Jack answered.

He pulled out the rain forest book. He flipped through the pages. He came to a picture of the red fruit.

“Here it is!” he said. He read out loud:

“The mango has a sweet taste like that of a peach.”



“Mango? Hmmm,” said Annie. She brought the fruit close to her lips.

“Hey!” said Jack, grabbing the mango from her. “We have to put it with the moonstone.”

Jack placed the mango on the M carved into the floor. Next to the clear moonstone.

“Moonstone … mango,” whispered Annie. It sounded like a spell.

“We’re halfway there,” said Jack. “Two more to go.”

“Then we can free you, Morgan!” Annie called, as if Morgan were nearby.

“How do you know she can hear you?” said Jack.

“I just feel it,” Annie said.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He needed more proof than that.

Squeak. Peanut was looking at Jack and Annie.

“We have to leave you now,” Jack said to the mouse.

Squeak.

“Can’t we take her with us?” said Annie.



“No,” said Jack. “Mom won’t let us keep a mouse in the house. She doesn’t like mice, remember?”

“How could anyone not like a mouse?” said Annie.

Jack smiled. “How could anyone not like a spider?” he said.

“That’s different.” Annie patted Peanut’s head. “Bye,” she said. “Wait for us here. We’ll be back tomorrow.”

Jack patted the mouse, too. “Bye, Peanut. Thanks for your help,” he said.

Squeak.

Jack put the rain forest book on top of the book about ninjas.

Then he pulled on his backpack. And he and Annie left the tree house.

They climbed down the rope ladder. They stepped onto the ground.

They started walking through the Frog Creek woods.

Leaf shadows danced in the light.

A bird called out.

These woods are very different from the rain forest, Jack thought.

“There’re no jaguars or army ants here,” he said. “No little monkeys.”

“You know, that monkey was never being mean,” said Annie. “He was just trying to give us the mango.”

“I know. Actually, nothing was being mean,” said Jack. “The army ants were just marching. That’s what army ants do.”

“The piranhas were just being piranhas,” said Annie.

“The snake was just being a snake,” said Jack.

“The crocodile was just being a crocodile,” said Annie.

“The jaguar was just taking care of her baby,” said Jack.



Annie shuddered. “I still don’t love bugs,” she said.

“You don’t have to love them,” said Jack. “Just leave them alone. And they won’t bother you.”

In fact, that’s true about the whole rain forest, Jack thought. Everyone should just leave it all alone.

“Who cares if the bugs don’t have names?” he said softly. “They know who they are.”

Jack and Annie stepped out of the Frog Creek woods.

They started walking up their street. It was lit with a golden light.

“Race you!” said Annie.

They took off running.

They ran across their yard.

They raced up their steps.

“Safe!” they shouted together, tagging their front door.

“Let’s go to the tree house,” said Annie.

She and Jack were passing the Frog Creek woods on their way home from their swimming class at the Y.

“No. I want to go home and change out of my bathing suit,” said Jack.

“Oh, that’ll take too long,” said Annie. “Don’t you want to save Morgan as soon as possible?”

“Of course,” said Jack.

“Then come on! Before the sun sets!” said Annie.

She darted into the woods.

Jack sighed. He gave up on the idea of changing out of his bathing suit.

He pushed his glasses into place. He followed Annie into the Frog Creek woods.

The warm air smelled fresh and green.

He moved through patches of sunlight and shadow. Soon he came to a small clearing.

He looked up. There it was. The magic tree house in the tallest tree in the woods.

“Hurry!” called Annie. She was climbing the rope ladder up to the tree house.

Jack grabbed the ladder. He started up after her.

Finally they reached the tree house.

Squeak. A mouse sat on the window sill.

“Hi, Peanut!” cried Annie.

Jack patted the tiny head.

“Sorry we didn’t come sooner,” Annie said. “But we had to go to our swimming lesson.”

Squeak.

“What happened while we were gone?” asked Annie, looking around the tree house.

Jack stared at the large M carved into the wooden floor.

On the M were a moonstone and a mango, the special things they’d found on their last two journeys.

“Hey, guess what?” said Jack. “Moonstone and mango start with the letter M. Just like Morgan.”

“You’re right,” said Annie.

“I bet all four things start with an M,” said Jack.

“Right,” said Annie. “I wonder where we’ll find the next one.”

She and Jack stared at the stacks of books in the tree house. Books on the Amazon rain forest, ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

All of them were closed. Only one book lay open in the corner.

“We’re just about to find out,” said Jack.

They walked over to the open book.

They looked at the page the book was opened to. It showed a picture of rocks and snow.

“Wow,” said Annie, running her finger over the picture. “I love snow. I wish we could go there right now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “We’re not prepared.” Then he had another thought. “And we’re wearing our bathing suits! Stop!”



“Oops,” said Annie.

Too late. The wind started to blow.

The leaves started to shake.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Then everything was silent.

It was as silent as the falling snow.

To all the kids who’ve helped me





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Jack and Annie visited dinosaurs, knights, an Egyptian queen, pirates, ninjas, and the Amazon rain forest.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian. She traveled through time and space, gathering books for King Arthur’s library.

On their fifth adventure, in Night of the Ninjas, Jack and Annie found a little mouse in the tree house. Annie named their new friend “Peanut.”

Jack and Annie also found a note from Morgan. The note told them that she was under a spell. To free her, Jack and Annie must find four special things.

They found the first thing in old Japan, and the second in the Amazon rain forest.

Now Jack and Annie and Peanut are about to set out in search of the third thing … in Sunset of the Sabertooth.



1. The “M” Things

“Let’s go to the tree house,” said Annie.

She and Jack were passing the Frog Creek woods on their way home from their swimming class at the Y.

“No. I want to go home and change out of my bathing suit,” said Jack.

“Oh, that’ll take too long,” said Annie. “Don’t you want to save Morgan as soon as possible?”

“Of course,” said Jack.

“Then come on! Before the sun sets!” said Annie.



She darted into the woods.

Jack sighed. He gave up on the idea of changing out of his bathing suit.

He pushed his glasses into place. He followed Annie into the Frog Creek woods.

The warm air smelled fresh and green.

He moved through patches of sunlight and shadow. Soon he came to a small clearing.

He looked up. There it was. The magic tree house in the tallest tree in the woods.

“Hurry!” called Annie. She was climbing the rope ladder up to the tree house.

Jack grabbed the ladder. He started up after her.

Finally they reached the tree house.

Squeak. A mouse sat on the window sill.

“Hi, Peanut!” cried Annie.

Jack patted the tiny head.

“Sorry we didn’t come sooner,” Annie said. “But we had to go to our swimming lesson.”

Squeak.

“What happened while we were gone?” asked Annie, looking around the tree house.

Jack stared at the large M carved into the wooden floor.

On the M were a moonstone and a mango, the special things they’d found on their last two journeys.

“Hey, guess what?” said Jack. “Moonstone and mango start with the letter M. Just like Morgan.”

“You’re right,” said Annie.

“I bet all four things start with an M,” said Jack.

“Right,” said Annie. “I wonder where we’ll find the next one.”

She and Jack stared at the stacks of books in the tree house. Books on the Amazon rain forest, ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

All of them were closed. Only one book lay open in the corner.

“We’re just about to find out,” said Jack.

They walked over to the open book.

They looked at the page the book was opened to. It showed a picture of rocks and snow.

“Wow,” said Annie, running her finger over the picture. “I love snow. I wish we could go there right now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “We’re not prepared.” Then he had another thought. “And we’re wearing our bathing suits! Stop!”



“Oops,” said Annie.

Too late. The wind started to blow.

The leaves started to shake.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Then everything was silent.

It was as silent as the falling snow.



2. Bones

Jack, Annie, and Peanut looked outside.

Snow was falling from a gray sky.

The tree house was in the tallest tree in a grove of tall, bare trees.

The grove was on a wide, white plain. Beyond the plain were high, rocky cliffs.

“I’m c-cold,” said Annie. Her teeth chattered. She wrapped her towel tightly around her.

Sq-squeak. Peanut sounded cold, too.

“Poor mouse,” said Annie. “I’ll put you into Jack’s pack. You’ll be warmer there.”

Annie slipped Peanut into the pocket of the backpack.

“We have to go home,” said Jack. “We need warmer clothes.”

“We can’t go home,” said Annie. “We can’t find the Pennsylvania book. Not until our mission is complete. Remember? That’s the way the magic works.”

“Oh … right,” said Jack. He looked around. There was no sign of the Pennsylvania book that always took them home.

Annie peered out the window again. “Where are we, anyway?” she asked.

“I’ll find out,” said Jack. He picked up the open book and read the title on the cover. “Life in the Ice Age.”



“Ice Age?” said Annie. “No wonder we’re cold.”

“We better find the third M thing soon,” said Jack. “Before we freeze to death.”

“Look,” whispered Annie, “people.” She pointed out the window.

Jack saw them, too: four figures on a cliff. Two big figures and two little ones—all holding long spears.

“Who are they?” said Annie.

“I’ll look in the book,” said Jack.

He found a picture of some people. He read the caption to Annie:

Early modern humans were called Cro-Magnons. During the late Ice Age in Europe, they sometimes lived in caves beneath cliffs.





“Why are they carrying spears?” said Annie.

Jack turned the page. He found another picture of the Cro-Magnons. He read aloud:

The Cro-Magnon family often hunted together. They covered deep pits with branches. Then they drove reindeer and mammoths into the traps.





“Oh, trapping the animals—that’s sad,” said Annie.

“No, it’s not,” said Jack. “They couldn’t live without hunting. They didn’t have supermarkets, you know.”

They watched the family disappear over the other side of the cliff.

“Come on, I’m freezing,” said Jack. “Let’s hurry and find the M thing while the Cro-Magnons are hunting.”

“But I want to meet them,” said Annie.

“Forget it,” said Jack. “They don’t have books that tell them about us. They’ll think we’re some enemy and hurl their spears.”

“Yikes,” said Annie.

Jack put his book away.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of the backpack.

“Stay in there,” said Annie.

Jack pulled on his pack and started down the rope ladder.

Annie followed.

On the icy ground, they huddled together.

The wind was biting. Jack put his towel over his head. Snow blew against his glasses.

“Hey, Jack,” said Annie. “Look at me.”

Annie had put on her swimming goggles. “Now I can see,” she said.

“Good thinking,” said Jack. “Now cover your head with your towel. Most of your body heat is lost through your head.”

Annie wrapped her towel around her head.

“We should find a cave or someplace warmer,” said Jack.

“I bet there are caves in those cliffs,” said Annie.

She and Jack started across the white plain. The snow wasn’t deep yet. But the wind was blowing hard.

“I told you!” Annie pointed to an opening in the rocks—a cave.

They ran to it.

“Careful,” said Jack. They stepped carefully into the shadowy cave.

It was only slightly warmer inside. But at least the wind wasn’t blowing.

In the gray light, they stamped the snow off their sneakers.

Annie took off her goggles.

“It smells in here,” said Jack.

“Yeah, like a wet dog,” said Annie.

“Let me see what I can find out,” said Jack.

He pulled out the Ice Age book.

“I’ll look around,” said Annie. “Maybe the M thing is here. Then we can go home and get warm.”

Jack stood by the entrance so he could read the book.

“This cave is filled with sticks,” Annie said.

“What?” said Jack. He didn’t look up from the book.

“No, wait. I think they’re bones,” said Annie.

“Bones?” echoed Jack.

“Yeah. Lots of them back here. All over the floor.”

Jack turned the pages of his book. He found a picture of a cave filled with bones.

“I hear something,” said Annie.

Jack read the writing below the picture of the cave. It said:

The great cave bears of the Ice Age were over eight feet tall. These bears were larger and fiercer than today’s grizzlies. Their caves were filled with the bones of their ancestors.





“Annie!” whispered Jack. “Get back here now!”

They were in the cave of a great cave bear!



3. Brrr!

“Annie!” whispered Jack again.

No answer.

He put his book quietly into his pack. He stepped deeper into the cave.

“Annie!” he said a little louder.

Jack stepped on the bones.

The wet dog smell grew stronger.

He kept going, deeper into the smelly blackness.

He ran into something. He gasped.

“Jack?” said Annie. “Is that you?”

“Didn’t you hear me calling?” Jack whispered. “We have to get out of here!”

“Wait,” she said. “Someone’s sleeping back there. Hear him snoring?”

Jack heard a low, deep moaning. It was loud, then soft. Loud, then soft.

“That’s not a person,” he said. “It’s a great cave bear!”

A booming snore shattered the air.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Go! Go!” said Jack.

He and Annie ran through the cave, over the bones, and out into the falling snow.

They kept on going. They ran between fallen rocks and under jagged cliffs.



Finally they stopped and turned around.

All they could see was snow and rocks and their own footprints.

No bear.

“Whew,” said Annie. “That was lucky.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “He probably never even woke up. We just got in a panic.”

Annie huddled close to Jack. “Brrr! I’m f-freezing,” she said.

“Me too,” he said.

He took off his glasses to wipe off the snow. The cold wind blew against his bare legs.

“Wow,” Annie said. “Look.” She pointed to something behind Jack.

“What?” Jack put his glasses back on and turned around.

Under a cliff was a wide ledge. Under the ledge was another cave.

Only this cave seemed to have a golden glow.

This one looked cozy and safe and warm.



4. Cave Kids

Jack and Annie crept to the cave and peeked inside.

A small flame danced from a bed of glowing coals.

Near the fire were knives, axes, and hollowed-out stones.

Animal skins were neatly stacked against the wall.

“People must live here,” said Annie.

“Maybe it’s the home of the Cro-Magnons we saw,” said Jack, looking around.

“Let’s go inside and get warm,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie moved quickly to the fire and warmed their hands.

Their shadows danced on the stone walls.

Jack pulled out his Ice Age book. He found a picture of a cave. He read:

Cro-Magnons made many things from animals, plants, and stone. They made flute-like musical instruments from mammoth bones. They made ropes by braiding plant fibers. They made axes and knives from stone.





Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He started a list:



“Ta-da!” said Annie.

Jack looked up. Annie was wearing a coat.

It had a hood and long sleeves. It went all the way down to her sneakers.

“Where did you get that?” said Jack.

“From that pile of furry skins,” said Annie, pointing. “These must be their clothes. Maybe they’re being mended.”

She picked up another coat and handed it to Jack.

“Try one. It’s really warm,” she said.

Jack put his backpack and towel down on the hard dirt floor. He slipped on the coat.



It did feel very warm—and soft.

“We look like cave kids,” said Annie.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of Jack’s pack lying on the floor.

“You stay in there,” said Annie. “There’s no teeny coat for you.”

Peanut vanished back into the pack.

“I wonder how they made these coats,” said Jack.

He turned the pages in the book until he found a picture of Cro-Magnon women sewing. He read:

Cro-Magnons scraped reindeer skins with flint rocks to make them soft. They used bone needles to sew the skins together for clothing.





Jack added to his list:



“I hope the cave people won’t mind if we borrow their coats,” said Jack.

“Maybe we should give them our towels,” said Annie. “To thank them.”

“Good idea.”

“And my goggles, too,” said Annie.

They left their gifts on top of the rest of the animal skins.

“Let’s explore the cave before they come home,” said Jack.

“It’s too dark in the back,” said Annie. “We won’t be able to see anything.”

“I’ll find out how Cro-Magnons saw in the dark,” said Jack.

He opened the Ice Age book. He found a picture of cave people holding odd-looking lamps. He read aloud to Annie:

Cro-Magnons made stone lamps. They hollowed out a rock, filled it with animal fat, then burned a wick made from moss.





“There!” said Annie. She pointed to two stones near the fire. In the hollow of each was gooey white stuff and a pile of moss.

“We have to be careful,” said Jack.

He picked up one stone. It was smaller than a soup bowl, but much heavier.

Jack held the stone close to the fire and lit the piece of moss.

He lit another lamp and gave it to Annie.

“Carry it with two hands,” he said.

“I know,” she said.

Jack tucked the book under his arm. He and Annie carried their stone lamps to the back of the cave.

“Hey, I wonder where this goes,” said Annie. She held her lamp up to an opening in the wall.

“I’ll check in the book,” said Jack.

He put down his lamp and flipped through the Ice Age book.

“I think it’s a tunnel,” she said. “Be right back.”

“Wait a second,” said Jack.

Too late—she had squeezed into the opening and was gone.

“Oh brother,” said Jack, sighing.

He closed his book and peeked into the opening.

“Come back here!” he said.

“No! You come here! ” said Annie. Her voice sounded far away. “You won’t believe this!”

Jack picked up his lamp and book. He ducked into a small tunnel.

“Wow!” came Annie’s voice.

Jack could see her lamp flickering at the other end.

Crouching clown, he hurried toward her. At the end of the tunnel was a huge cavern with a high ceiling.

Annie held her lamp close to the wall.

“Look,” she said. Her voice echoed.

Animals were painted on the wall in strokes of red and black and yellow.

There were cave bears and lions, elk and reindeer, bison and woolly rhinos and mammoths.

In the flickering light, the prehistoric beasts looked alive.



5. Snow Tracks

“Wow, what is this place?” said Jack.

“Maybe it’s an art gallery,” said Annie.

“I don’t think so,” said Jack. “It’s too hard to get to.”

He read about the cave paintings:

These Ice Age beasts were painted 25,000 years ago. Cro-Magnons painted pictures of animals they hunted. They may have believed the paintings would give them power over the animals.





“Wow, look at this,” said Annie.

She pointed at a painting farther down the wall.

It showed a figure with human arms and legs, reindeer antlers, and an owl face. It seemed to be holding a flute.



Jack looked at the book again. He found a picture of the figure and read:

Cave men may have been led by a sorcerer, or “Master of the Animals.” He may have worn reindeer antlers so he could run like a reindeer—and an owl mask so he could see like an owl.





“What is it?” said Annie.

“The Master of the Animals,” said Jack. “He’s a sorcerer.”

“Oh wow,” breathed Annie. “That’s it.”

“That’s what?”

“That’s who we have to find.”

“Why?”

“Maybe he’s a friend of Morgan’s,” said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly. “Maybe,” he said.

“Let’s go find him,” said Annie.

They went back through the tunnel into the first cave.

“We better put our lamps back,” said Jack.

He and Annie blew out their lamps.

They placed them back by the fire.

Jack’s backpack was on the floor next to the skins. He put the Ice Age book into it.

“How’s Peanut?” said Annie.

Jack looked into his pack. “She’s not here,” he said.

“Oh no!” cried Annie. “She must have crawled out when we were looking at the paintings.’’

“Peanut!” Jack called.

“Peanut!” called Annie.

Annie walked slowly around the cave, looking into the shadows.

Jack peered around the fire and under each of the furry skins.

“Jack! Come here!” said Annie.

She was standing near the entrance to the cave.

The snow had stopped falling.

In the snow were tiny tracks.



6. Song on the Wind

“Peanut’s tracks,” said Annie. “We have to find her before she freezes.”

She wrapped her reindeer coat around her and headed across the snow.

Jack pulled on his backpack and followed.

The mouse’s tracks led them between the fallen rocks and back onto the open plain.

The wind blew harder. Snow swirled over the ground, covering the tiny footprints.

“I can’t see them anymore!” wailed Annie.

She and Jack now stood in the middle of the plain. They stared at the windswept snow.

The mouse’s tracks had vanished.

“Yikes,” whispered Annie, staring up.

Jack followed her gaze. On one of the cliffs was a tiger. A giant tiger with two long, sharp fangs.

“A sabertooth,” said Jack.

“I hope he doesn’t see us,” whispered Annie.

“Me too,” Jack whispered back. “We’d better head back to the tree house.”

Jack and Annie stepped very softly across the snow. Then Jack glanced back at the cliff.

The sabertooth was gone.

“Oh man,” he said. “Where is he?”

“Run to the trees!” said Annie.

He and Annie started running. They ran over the snowy plain, heading toward the tall, bare trees in the distance.

Suddenly Jack heard a crack.

The ground caved in, and Jack went with it.

Annie fell beside him.

They crashed down onto a heap of branches, snow, and earth.

They struggled to stand. Jack pushed his glasses into place.

“You all right?” he asked Annie.

“Yes,” she said.

They both looked up. They were in a deep hole. All Jack could see were gray clouds moving overhead.

“This is a trap,” Jack said. “The Cro-Magnons must have put branches over this hole. Then the snow hid the branches. So we didn’t see them.”

“There’s no way out,” said Annie.

She was right. They were helpless. The pit was too deep to climb out of.

“I feel like a trapped animal,” Annie said.

“Me too,” said Jack.

He heard a yowl in the distance.

“The sabertooth!” whispered Annie.

Jack pulled out the Ice Age book. He found a picture of the sabertooth. He read:

The sabertooth was the fiercest beast of the Ice Age. It attacked humans as well as woolly mammoths and other large animals.





“Oh brother,” said Jack.

“Listen!” Annie grabbed him.

“What?” Jack jumped.

“I hear music.”

Jack listened. But all he heard was the wind.

“You hear it?” said Annie.

“No,” said Jack.

“Listen carefully.”

He closed his eyes. He listened very carefully.

He heard the wind. But this time he heard another sound, too.

Strange, haunting music.

“Ahhh!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

Staring down at them was a figure wearing reindeer antlers and an owl mask.



“The sorcerer,” whispered Jack.

Squeak.

Peanut peered down at them, too!



7. The Sorcerer’s Gift

The sorcerer didn’t speak. He stared through the eyeholes of the owl mask.

“Help us, please,” said Annie.

The sorcerer threw a rope into the pit. Jack grabbed it.

“He wants to pull us up,” said Annie.

Jack looked up. The sorcerer was gone.

“Where did he go?” Jack said.

“Tug on the rope,” said Annie.

Jack tugged. The rope tightened. It began rising.

“I’ll go first!” said Annie cheerfully.

“Annie, this isn’t a game,” warned Jack.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.”

Jack gave her the rope. “Okay. But hold on tight,” he said.

Annie held the rope with both hands. She pushed her feet against the side of the pit. She rose into the air with the rope.

She kept pressing against the side of the pit—until she reached the top.

Jack saw the sorcerer reappear and help Annie up. Then they moved out of sight.

Jack was puzzled. The sorcerer had used both hands to help Annie. So who held the other end of the rope?

“Wow!” came Annie’s voice.

What’s going on? Jack wondered.

The sorcerer came back and threw the rope down again.

Jack grabbed it. And the rope started to rise.

Jack held on tight. He started up. His hands burned. His arms felt as if they were being pulled out of their sockets.

But he kept his hold on the rope and his feet against the side of the pit.

At the top the sorcerer pulled Jack onto the snowy ground.

“Thanks,” said Jack, standing.

The sorcerer was tall. He wore a long fur robe. Jack could see only his eyes through the owl mask.

“Hey!” Annie called.

Jack turned.

Annie was sitting on a woolly mammoth.

Squeak. Peanut was sitting on the mammoth’s head.

The mammoth looked like a giant elephant with shaggy reddish hair and long, curved tusks.

The other end of the rope was around the mammoth’s huge neck.

“Lulu pulled us up,” said Annie.

“Lulu?” said Jack.

“Don’t you think she looks like a Lulu?” said Annie.

“Oh brother,” said Jack. He walked up to the mammoth.

“Hey, mammoth starts with M,” said Annie. “Maybe Lulu’s the special thing!”

“I don’t think so,” said Jack.

The great creature knelt down, just like a circus elephant.

“Whoa!” said Annie. She clutched the mammoth’s ears to keep from falling off.

The sorcerer helped Jack climb onto the mammoth.



“Thanks,” said Jack.

Then the sorcerer reached into a pouch. He pulled out a smooth white bone and handed it to Jack.

The bone was hollow. It had four holes along one side. And two on the other.

“Oh man, I think it’s his flute,” said Jack. “The book said they make flutes from mammoth bones.”

Jack tried to give the flute back to the sorcerer.

“Nice,” he said politely.

But the sorcerer held up his hand.

“He wants you to keep the mammoth bone,” said Annie.

“Mammoth bone,” whispered Jack. ‘‘Hey, maybe this is the third thing.”

Jack looked at the sorcerer. “Do you know Morgan?” he asked.

The sorcerer did not answer. But his eyes sparkled with kindness.

He turned away from Jack and untied the mammoth’s rope. Then he whispered in the ear of the giant woolly creature.

When the mammoth stood up, Jack gripped Annie’s coat to keep from falling off. He felt miles above the ground.

He nestled behind Annie, in the dip between the mammoth’s head and huge curved back.

The mammoth took slow, plodding steps across the snow, then picked up speed.

“Where are we going?” said Jack as they bumped up and down.

“To the tree house!” said Annie.

“How does he know where it is?” said Jack.

“She just knows,” said Annie.

Jack looked back.

The sorcerer was standing in the snow, watching them.

But at that moment the clouds parted, and the sun came out.

Jack was blinded by sunlight on the snow.

He squinted to see—but the sorcerer had vanished.


8. The Great Parade



The huge mammoth walked across the open plain.

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed to a herd of elk in the distance. They had great, wide antlers.

“There!” said Jack as a herd of reindeer came into view. They pranced gracefully across the snow.

Then a woolly rhino joined them on the open plain. Then a bison!

The elk, reindeer, rhino, and bison moved along with them, at a distance.

They seemed to be escorting Jack and Annie back to the tree house.

The snow sparkled with sunlight.

This is a great parade, Jack thought. Fantastic.

They were getting closer and closer to the grove of tall trees.

“I told you,” said Annie. “Lulu’s taking us home.”

But just then the mammoth let out a cry. All the other animals bounded off.

Peanut started to squeak.

Jack looked around.

Behind them the sabertooth was slinking across the sunlit snow!

The woolly mammoth roared and plunged forward.

Jack and Annie nearly fell off.

Jack clutched Annie. She and Peanut clutched the mammoth’s shaggy hair.

The mammoth thundered wildly over the ground.

“Ahhh!” Jack and Annie yelled.

The mammoth charged to the grove of trees.

But the tiger had circled around the trees. He stood between the tallest tree and the mammoth.

They were trapped.

The sabertooth began moving slowly toward the mammoth.

The woolly mammoth roared fiercely.



But Jack knew a sabertooth could kill any creature, including a mammoth.

The huge tiger’s head was down. His burning eyes were fixed on the mammoth. His long white fangs glinted in the sunlight.



9. Master of the Animals

The sabertooth crept forward.

Jack stared in horror.

“Play the flute,” whispered Annie.

Is she nuts? Jack thought.

“Try!” said Annie.

Jack held the mammoth-bone flute to his lips. He blew.

The flute made a strange sound.

The tiger froze. He glared at Jack.

Jack’s hands shook.

The tiger growled. He took another step.

The mammoth roared and stomped the ground.

“Play it!” said Annie. “Keep playing!”

Jack blew again.

The sabertooth froze again.

Jack kept blowing until he ran out of breath.

The tiger snarled.

“He’s still here,” whispered Annie. “Keep it up.”

Jack closed his eyes. He took a deep breath. Then he blew as hard and as long as he could. He covered and uncovered the holes on the bone.

The music sounded strange—as if it were coming from another world.

“He’s leaving!” Annie whispered.

Jack raised his eyes. The sabertooth was slinking off toward the cliffs.

“We did it!” said Annie.

Jack lowered the flute. He felt very tired.

The mammoth waved her trunk happily.

“To the tree house, Lulu,” said Annie.

The woolly mammoth snorted. Then she lumbered over to the tallest tree.

From the back of the mammoth, Jack grabbed the rope ladder. He held it for Annie.

She stroked the mammoth’s giant ear. “Bye, Lulu. Thank you,” she said.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder. Then she started up. Peanut climbed up, too.

After they disappeared into the tree house, Jack climbed onto the ladder.

He looked back at the woolly mammoth. “Bye, girl,” he said. “Go home now. And watch out for the sabertooth.”

The mammoth walked away into the sunset.



When Jack couldn’t see her anymore, he started up the lope ladder. He pulled himself into the tree house.

“Ta-da!” said Annie. She handed the Pennsylvania book to Jack.

Jack smiled. Now he was positive they had found the third M thing. Their mission was complete.

“Before we leave, we have to give our coats back,” said Annie.

“Oh right,” said Jack.

They took off their reindeer-skin coats and dropped them to the ground.

“Brrr!” said Annie. “I hope the Cro-Magnon people find them.”

Jack stared out the window. He wanted to take one last look at the prehistoric world.

The sun was setting behind the hills. Four people were crossing the snowy plain. It was the Cro-Magnon family.

“Hey!” shouted Annie.

“Shhh!” said Jack.

The Cro-Magnons stopped and peered in Annie and Jack’s direction.

“We left your reindeer skins! Down there!” Annie pointed to the ground.

The tallest person stepped forward and raised a spear.

“Time to go,” said Jack.

He grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He found the picture of Frog Creek and pointed at it. “I wish we could go home,” he said.

“Good-bye! Good luck!” Annie called, waving out the window.

The wind started to blow. And the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. This Age

Birds sang. The air was soft and warm.

“I hope they find their coats,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. He pushed his glasses into place.

Squeak.

“Hey, you—how did you find the sorcerer?” Annie asked Peanut.

Squeak.

“It’s a secret, huh?” said Annie. She turned to Jack. “Where’s the flute?”



He held up the mammoth bone. Then he placed it on the M carved into the floor. Next to the mango from the rain forest. Next to the moonstone from the time of ninjas.

“Moonstone, mango, mammoth bone … ” Annie said. “We need just one more M thing. Then Morgan will be free from her spell.”

“Tomorrow,” said Jack.

Annie patted Peanut on the head. “Bye, you,” she said.

She started down the rope ladder.

Jack gathered his things.

He paused and glanced at the mouse. She stared at him with big brown eyes.

“Thanks again for helping us,” he said.

Then he climbed down the rope ladder and jumped onto the ground.

Jack and Annie ran through the Frog Creek woods onto their street.

Their neighborhood looked rosy in the sunset.

It’s great to be back in this age, Jack thought. Warm and safe and almost home.

“I’m glad we don’t have to go hunting for dinner,” he said.

“Yeah, Mom and Dad already did that,” said Annie, “at the supermarket.”

“I hope they trapped some spaghetti and meatballs,” said Jack.

“I hope they trapped a pizza,” said Annie.

“Hurry, I’m starving,” said Jack.

They ran up their sidewalk and through their front door.

“We’re home!” shouted Annie.

“What’s for dinner?” shouted Jack.

“Jack!” whispered a voice.

Jack opened his eyes. He saw a figure in the moonlight.

“Wake up. Get dressed.” It was his sister, Annie.

Jack turned on his lamp. He rubbed his eyes.

Annie was standing beside his bed. She wore jeans and a sweatshirt.

“Let’s go to the tree house,” she said.

“What time is it?” asked Jack. He put on his glasses.

“Don’t look at your clock,” said Annie.

Jack looked at his clock. “Oh, man,” he said. “It’s midnight. It’s too dark.”

“No, it isn’t. The moon makes it bright enough to see,” said Annie.

“Wait till morning,” said Jack.

“No—now,” said Annie. “We have to find the fourth M thing. I have a feeling that the full moon might help us.”

“That’s nuts,” said Jack. “I want to sleep.”

“You can sleep when we come back home,” said Annie. “No time will have passed.”

Jack sighed. “Oh, brother,” he said.

But he got out of bed.

“Yay!” whispered Annie. “Meet you at the back door.” She tiptoed out of Jack’s room.

Jack yawned. He pulled on his jeans and sneakers and a sweatshirt. He put his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he crept down the stairs.

Annie opened the back door. Quietly, they stepped outside.

“Wait—” said Jack. “We need a flashlight.”

“No, we don’t. I told you—the moon will light our way,” said Annie. And she took off.

Jack sighed, then followed her.

Annie was right, thought Jack. The moon was so bright that he could see his shadow. Everything seemed washed with silver.

Soon they left their street. Annie led the way into the Frog Creek woods. It was much darker under the shadows of the trees.

Jack looked up, searching for the tree house.

“There!” said Annie.

The magic tree house was shining in the moonlight.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing up.

“Careful—go slowly,” said Jack.

He followed her up the ladder and into the tree house.



Moonlight streamed through the window.

It shone on the letter M that shimmered on the wooden floor.

It shone on the three M things that rested on the M: a moonstone from the time of the ninjas, a mango from the Amazon rain forest, and a mammoth bone from the Ice Age.

“We need just one more M thing,” said Annie, “to free Morgan from her spell.”

Squeak.

“Peanut!” said Annie.

In the dim light, Jack saw a tiny mouse. She sat on an open book.

“You didn’t expect to see us this late, did you?” said Annie.

She picked up Peanut. And Jack picked up the open book.

“So where are we going this time?” Annie asked him.

Jack held the book up to the moonlight.

“Uh-oh,” he said. “I knew we should have brought a flashlight. I can’t read a thing.”

He could make out diagrams and shadowy pictures. But he couldn’t read a word.

“Look at the cover,” said Annie.

The letters were bigger on the cover. Jack squinted at them.

“It’s called Hello, Moon,” he said.

Annie gasped. “We’re going to the moon?”

“Of course not,” said Jack. “It’s impossible to go to the moon without tons of equipment.”

“Why?”

“There’s no air. We couldn’t breathe. Not only that, we’d boil to death if it was day and freeze to death if it was night.”

“Yikes,” said Annie. “So where do you think we are going?”

“Maybe a place where people train to be astronauts,” said Jack.

“That sounds neat,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He’d always wanted to meet astronauts and space scientists.

“So say the wish,” said Annie.

Jack opened the book again. He pointed to a picture of a dome-shaped structure.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent. As quiet and still as silence could be.

For Jacob and Elena Levi

and Aram and Molly Hanessian





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house.

The tree house was filled with books and it was magic. It could go any place that was in a book. All Jack and Annie had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

They visited dinosaurs, knights, an Egyptian queen, pirates, ninjas, and the Amazon rain forest.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She traveled through time and space, gathering books for her library.

One day, Jack and Annie found a note that said Morgan was under a spell. Jack and Annie set out in the magic tree house to find four special things that would free her.

With the help of a mouse named Peanut, Jack and Annie found the first thing in old Japan, the second in the Amazon rain forest, and the third in the Ice Age.

Now Jack, Annie, and Peanut are ready to find the last thing … in Midnight on the Moon.



1. By Moonlight

“Jack!” whispered a voice.

Jack opened his eyes. He saw a figure in the moonlight.

“Wake up. Get dressed.” It was his sister, Annie.

Jack turned on his lamp. He rubbed his eyes.

Annie was standing beside his bed. She wore jeans and a sweatshirt.

“Let’s go to the tree house,” she said.

“What time is it?” asked Jack. He put on his glasses.

“Don’t look at your clock,” said Annie.

Jack looked at his clock. “Oh, man,” he said. “It’s midnight. It’s too dark.”

“No, it isn’t. The moon makes it bright enough to see,” said Annie.

“Wait till morning,” said Jack.

“No—now,” said Annie. “We have to find the fourth M thing. I have a feeling that the full moon might help us.”

“That’s nuts,” said Jack. “I want to sleep.”

“You can sleep when we come back home,” said Annie. “No time will have passed.”

Jack sighed. “Oh, brother,” he said.

But he got out of bed.

“Yay!” whispered Annie. “Meet you at the back door.” She tiptoed out of Jack’s room.

Jack yawned. He pulled on his jeans and sneakers and a sweatshirt. He put his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he crept down the stairs.

Annie opened the back door. Quietly, they stepped outside.

“Wait—” said Jack. “We need a flashlight.”

“No, we don’t. I told you—the moon will light our way,” said Annie. And she took off.

Jack sighed, then followed her.

Annie was right, thought Jack. The moon was so bright that he could see his shadow. Everything seemed washed with silver.

Soon they left their street. Annie led the way into the Frog Creek woods. It was much darker under the shadows of the trees.

Jack looked up, searching for the tree house.

“There!” said Annie.

The magic tree house was shining in the moonlight.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing up.

“Careful—go slowly,” said Jack.

He followed her up the ladder and into the tree house.



Moonlight streamed through the window.

It shone on the letter M that shimmered on the wooden floor.

It shone on the three M things that rested on the M: a moonstone from the time of the ninjas, a mango from the Amazon rain forest, and a mammoth bone from the Ice Age.

“We need just one more M thing,” said Annie, “to free Morgan from her spell.”

Squeak.

“Peanut!” said Annie.

In the dim light, Jack saw a tiny mouse. She sat on an open book.

“You didn’t expect to see us this late, did you?” said Annie.

She picked up Peanut. And Jack picked up the open book.

“So where are we going this time?” Annie asked him.

Jack held the book up to the moonlight.

“Uh-oh,” he said. “I knew we should have brought a flashlight. I can’t read a thing.”

He could make out diagrams and shadowy pictures. But he couldn’t read a word.

“Look at the cover,” said Annie.

The letters were bigger on the cover. Jack squinted at them.

“It’s called Hello, Moon,” he said.

Annie gasped. “We’re going to the moon?”

“Of course not,” said Jack. “It’s impossible to go to the moon without tons of equipment.”

“Why?”

“There’s no air. We couldn’t breathe. Not only that, we’d boil to death if it was day and freeze to death if it was night.”

“Yikes,” said Annie. “So where do you think we are going?”

“Maybe a place where people train to be astronauts,” said Jack.

“That sounds neat,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He’d always wanted to meet astronauts and space scientists.

“So say the wish,” said Annie.

Jack opened the book again. He pointed to a picture of a dome-shaped structure.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent. As quiet and still as silence could be.



2. Space Motel

Jack opened his eyes.

He looked out the window. The tree house had landed inside a large white room.

“What kind of training place is this?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

The room was round. It had no windows. It had white floors and a curved wall lit by bright lights.

“Hello!” Annie called.

There was no answer.

Where were all the astronauts and space scientists? Jack wondered.

“There’s nobody here,” said Annie.

“How do you know?” said Jack.

“I just feel it,” said Annie.

“We’d better find out where we are,” said Jack.

He looked at the page in the moon book. He read the words below the picture of the dome.

A moon base was built on the moon in the year 2031. The top of the dome slides open to let spacecrafts enter and leave.



“Oh, man—” Jack whispered.

“What’s wrong?” said Annie.

Jack’s heart pounded with excitement. He could hardly speak. “We’ve landed inside a moon base,” he said.

“So … ?” said Annie.

“So the moon base is on the moon!” said Jack.

Annie’s eyes widened. “We’re on the moon?” she asked.

Jack nodded. “The book says the moon base was built in the year 2031,” he said. “So this book was written after that! Which means this book is from the future!”

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “Morgan must have gone forward in time to borrow it from a future library.”

“Right,” said Jack. “And now we’re in the future, on the moon.”

Squeak, squeak!

Annie and Jack looked at Peanut. The mouse was running around in circles.

“Poor Peanut,” said Annie.

She tried to pick the mouse up. But Peanut hid behind the mango on the letter M.

“Maybe she’s nervous about being on the moon,” said Annie.

“She’s not the only one,” said Jack. He let out a deep breath, then he pushed his glasses into place.

“So what’s a moon base?” asked Annie.

Jack looked at the book. He read aloud:

When scientists visit the moon for short periods, they eat and sleep in the moon base.



“A space motel!” said Annie.

“I guess,” said Jack. He read more:

The small base has a landing chamber and a room for storing spacesuits. Air and temperature controls make breathing possible.



“So that’s why we can breathe,” Jack said.

“Let’s explore,” said Annie. “We have to find the fourth thing for Morgan.”

“No, first we should study this map,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook.

“You study it,” said Annie.

Jack copied the map. Then he drew in the tree house.





“Okay,” he said. He pointed at the X in his drawing. “We’re here.”

Jack looked up. Annie was gone.

“Oh, brother,” Jack said. As usual, she had left without him. Before they could even make a plan.

Jack put the moon book and pencil into his pack. Carrying his notebook and backpack, he started out the window.

Squeak! Squeak!

Jack looked back at Peanut. The mouse was running back and forth on the M.

“Stay here and be safe,” said Jack. “We’ll be back soon.”

Jack swung himself over the window sill. His feet touched the floor of the landing chamber.

“Annie!” he called.

There was no answer.

Jack looked at his diagram.

It showed only one way to go. Jack walked along the curved white wall to the stairs.

He climbed the steps to a hallway.

“Jack—hurry!” Annie was at the end of the hallway, standing in the airlock. She peered out a window in a giant door.

Jack hurried toward her. Annie stepped aside so he could look out the window, too.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. What he saw took his breath away.

He stared at a rocky gray land. The land was filled with giant craters and tall mountains. The sun was shining. But the sky was ink-black!

“Say hi to the moon,” Annie said softly.



3. Open Sesame!

“The fourth M thing must be out there,” said Annie.

Beside the door was a button with the word OPEN on it. Annie reached for the button.

“Wait!” Jack grabbed her hand. “There’s no air on the moon. Remember?”

“Oh. Right. But we have to go out to find the M thing.”

“Let’s see what the book says,” said Jack.

He pulled the book out of his pack. He flipped through it until he found a page that showed the surface of the moon. He read aloud:

It takes fourteen Earth days to equal one day on the moon. No air protects the moon from the sun’s rays, so daytime heat reaches 260 degrees.



Jack looked at Annie. “I told you our blood would boil if we went out there,” he said.

“Yuck,” she said.

Jack read from the book again:

Moon scientists wear spacesuits, which have controls to keep them from getting too hot or too cold. They have tanks, which provide air for two hours.



“Where do we get spacesuits?” asked Annie. She looked around then trotted back down the hall. “Maybe there … ?”

Jack was studying his map. “Let’s try the spacesuit storeroom.”

“Don’t look at the map,” said Annie. “Look at the real room!”

Jack glanced up. Annie was peering through a doorway off the hall.

“There’s a ton of space stuff in here!” she said.

Jack went to look.

Bulky white suits hung from hangers. Air tanks, helmets, gloves, and boots sat in neat rows on shelves.

“Wow, it’s like the armor room in a castle,” said Jack.

“Yeah, with huge armor,” said Annie.

“Let’s pick out the smallest stuff,” said Jack. “The suits can go over our clothes.”

Annie found the smallest white suit. And Jack found the next smallest. They stepped into them.

Then Annie locked Jack’s air tank into place.

“Thanks,” he said. And he did the same for her.

“Thanks,” she said.

“Gloves?” said Jack. He and Annie pulled on white gloves.

“Boots?” said Annie. They each pulled on a pair of huge white boots.

“Helmets?” said Jack. He reached for a helmet.

“Wow, they’re pretty light,” he said. “I thought they’d be like knights’ helmets.”



Jack and Annie put the helmets on. They locked each other’s into place.

“I can’t move my head right or left,” said Annie.

“Me neither,” said Jack. “Let’s try walking.”

Jack and Annie moved clumsily around the room. Jack felt like a fat snowman.

“Close your visor,” said Annie.

They both closed their see-through visors. Cool air filled Jack’s helmet.

“I CAN BREATHE!” Annie yelled. Her voice boomed in Jack’s ears.

“Ow! Talk quietly,” Jack said. “We have two-way radios inside our helmets.”

“Sorry,” whispered Annie.

Jack put the moon book back in his pack. Then he slung the pack over his shoulder.

“Okay!” he said. “Remember, we only have two hours of air in our tanks. So we need to find the fourth M thing really fast.”

“I hope we can find it,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. He knew they could not go home until they did.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. She gave Jack a little push.

“Watch it. No goofing off,” he said. “We don’t want to fall over in these suits.”

“Just go—go!” said Annie. She pushed him out of the room. They walked back to the airlock.

“Ready?” said Annie. “Open sesame!” She pressed the OPEN button. A door slowly slid closed behind them. A door opened in front of them.

And Jack and Annie stepped out onto the moon.



4. Moon Rabbits

“Oh, wow!” said Annie. She took a step forward.

But Jack stood frozen. He wanted to get a good look at everything first.

He stared at the ground. He was standing in a layer of gray dust as fine as powder.

Footprints were everywhere. Jack wondered who had made them.

He reached into his pack for the moon book. To his surprise, it was as light as a feather!

He found a picture of footprints on the moon. He read:

The moon has no rain or wind to blow the dust around. So footprints will never wear away naturally, not even in a billion years.



“Oh, man,” Jack said.

The moon was the stillest place he had ever, ever been. It was as still as a picture. And its stillness would never, ever end.

Jack stared at the ink-black sky. A lovely blue-and-white ball glowed far away.

Earth.

For the first time, it really hit Jack. They were in outer space.

“Look!” Annie cried, laughing.

She bounded past Jack—almost flying through the air. She landed on her feet. Then she jumped again.

“I’m a moon rabbit,” she called.

Jack laughed. How does she do that? he wondered. He turned a page and read:

A person weighs less on the moon because of the moon’s low gravity and lack of air. If you weigh 60 pounds on Earth, you would only weigh 10 pounds on the moon.



“Don’t just stand there reading!” said Annie, grabbing the book from Jack’s gloved hand. She tossed it into space.

It flew far away.

Jack started after it.

He bounded up and down. Boing! Boing! Boing! Now he felt as light as a feather.

“Look!” he called to Annie. “I’m a moon rabbit, too.”

Where Jack’s boots hit the ground, moondust gracefully sprayed into space.

The book had landed at the edge of a shallow crater.

When Jack reached it, he tried to stop. But his feet slipped.



He fell right over and lay on his side. He tried to stand. But he was off-balance.

He tried again. But the dust was just too deep. And his spacesuit was too clumsy.

“You okay?” asked Annie.

“I can’t get up,” said Jack.

“You shouldn’t have been goofing off,” said Annie wisely.

“You goofed off first,” said Jack. “Now, help me up, please.”

Annie started toward him.

“Don’t fall, too,” warned Jack.

“I won’t.” Annie moved very slowly. She half floated, half walked.

“Give me your hand,” she said.

Annie grabbed Jack’s hand. She pressed her boot against his and pulled him up.

“Thanks,” he said.

“No problem,” she said. “It was easy. You were really light.”

“Thank goodness,” said Jack. “It’s impossible to get up alone.”

He picked up the moon book. It was covered with dust. He brushed it off.

“Oh, wow! Look!” said Annie. She stood at the edge of the crater.

“What is it?” said Jack.

“A moon buggy!” said Annie.

The buggy was parked in the crater. It had four huge wheels.

“Let’s go for a ride,” said Annie.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “We just have two hours of air in our tanks. Remember?”

“I bet we’ll find the M thing faster if we take the moon buggy!” Annie bounded into the crater.

“But we can’t drive!” said Jack.

“I bet I can drive this,” said Annie. “It looks easy. Come on!”

She jumped into the driver’s seat.

“But you don’t have a license!” said Jack.

“Who cares?” said Annie. “There aren’t any roads on the moon, or stoplights, or policemen either.”

She was right, Jack thought.

“Well, go slow,” he said. And he climbed in beside her.

Annie pushed a button labeled ON.

The moon buggy lurched backward.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Step on the brake!” said Jack.

Annie pressed a pedal on the floor. The buggy stopped with a jerk.

“Whew,” she said.

“It must be in reverse,” said Jack. “Let me study this—”

But before he could study anything, Annie pushed another button.

The buggy tilted back. Its front wheels started to rise into the air.

“Let me out of here!” said Jack.

Annie pushed more buttons.

The buggy’s front wheels landed back on the ground. And the buggy leaped forward.

“Slower!” said Jack.

“I can’t,” said Annie. “I don’t know how!”

Annie steered the buggy over the tracks on the ground. The wide wheels kept it from sinking into the deep dust.

“Careful!” said Jack.

The buggy zoomed out of the crater.

Gray clouds of dust rose behind them as they took off across the moon.



5. Hang On!

Annie drove the moon buggy over bumps and hollows. It bucked like a bronco.

“I’m going through there!” She pointed to an opening between two mountains.

Jack held on to the dashboard.

The buggy bumped toward the opening and shot through.

On the other side, the ground was even rockier.

“Look for the fo-fourth M thing!” said Annie, bouncing up and down.

Jack groaned. Looking for anything on this wild ride was impossible.

“Sl-slow d-down!” he said.

“How?”

“Try pressing on the b-brake pedal. On the f-floor—slowly!”

Annie pressed on the brake.

The buggy slowed down. Jack sighed with relief. The ride was still bumpy. But now, at least, he could take a good look at the moon.

He had never been to such a colorless, barren place. There was no green, no blue, no red.

No water, no trees, no clouds.

Only giant gray rocks and craters—and an American flag.





“Oh, man,” said Jack. “That’s from the first astronauts who landed on the moon!”

“And look—a telescope!” said Annie.

She drove near the flag and telescope. Then she put her foot on the brake until the buggy stopped.

She pressed a button that said OFF. Then she and Jack hopped out.

They took slow giant steps to the site of the first moon landing.

Beside the flag was a sign. Annie read it aloud:

HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH

FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON,

JULY 1969 A.D.

WE CAME IN PEACE

FOR ALL MANKIND.



“That’s a good message,” said Jack.

He handed the moon book to Annie. Then he took out his notebook and pencil to copy the sign.

“Let’s leave our own message,” said Annie.

“What should we say?” said Jack.

“The same thing,” said Annie. “But say we are the first kids.”

Jack turned to a new page in his notebook. In big letters he wrote their message.

“Now we have to sign it,” Annie said.

Jack signed his name.

Then he passed the notebook and pencil to Annie. She signed her name and passed the notebook back.

Jack tore out the piece of paper. He put it by the flag.





No wind would ever blow the message away. No rain would ever fall on it.

It would be there forever, unless someone moved it.

Thinking of “forever” made Jack feel dizzy. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Then he remembered the time. Had two hours passed yet?

“I wish I had a watch,” he said, standing up. “We might be running out of time.”

“Oh, wow. A moon man!” said Annie.

“What?” Jack turned to look at her.

She was staring through the telescope.

Jack walked over to the telescope. Annie stepped aside so he could look, too.

Jack gasped. In the distance, something was flying above the ground.

It looked like a giant man in a spacesuit.



6. High Jump

“Who is that?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But we’ll soon find out!” She started waving.

“No!” said Jack. He grabbed her arm. “Let’s go back to the base—before he gets here!”

“Why?” said Annie.

“We don’t know who he is!” said Jack. “We don’t know if he’s friendly or mean or what.”

“But we can’t go back,” said Annie. “We haven’t found the fourth M thing yet. We won’t be able to go home.”

“It doesn’t matter. We can lock the door at the moon base until he goes away,” said Jack. “Then we can get new air tanks!”

Jack hurried to the moon buggy. “Come on!” He jumped into the driver’s seat.

Annie gave a little wave to the dot in the sky. Then she climbed into the moon buggy.

The buggy took off.

“Careful!” said Annie.

They bumped over the rocks as Jack turned the buggy around. Then they zoomed toward the pass.

Jack steered around craters and rocks. More than once the buggy nearly tipped over.

“Whoa! Slow down!” said Annie.

They were almost at the mountain pass. Suddenly, a cloud of dust flew up in front of them. The ground trembled.

“Watch it!” cried Annie.

Jack couldn’t see a thing.

He stepped on the brake. The buggy jerked to a stop.

The dust settled.

A giant rock had fallen into the narrow pass. It was stuck between two walls of rock. They were trapped!

Jack quickly found a picture of a giant rock in the moon book. He read aloud:

Rocks of all sizes crash into the moon from outer space. These rocks are called meteorites.



“We’re lucky that meteorite didn’t land on us,” said Jack.

“Yeah, and I guess it’s too big to be the M thing,” said Annie. She had climbed out of the moon buggy and was standing by the meteorite.

It was more than twice as tall as she was.

Jack looked at the black sky. The flying thing was nowhere in sight—yet.

“We’ll have to jump over it,” Annie said.

“Jump? I don’t think so,” said Jack. “It’s too high.”

“I’m going to try anyway,” said Annie.

“Wait. Let’s think first,” said Jack.

But Annie was already backing up.

“One, two, three—go!” she shouted, and took giant, leaping steps toward the meteorite.

When Annie got close to the rock, she pushed off the ground. Then she flew through space and disappeared behind the meteorite.

“Annie!” Jack called.

There was no answer.

“Oh, brother,” Jack said. He backed up and took off toward the rock. He jumped as high as he could. Then he was flying through space.



Jack hit the ground and fell facedown into the dust.

Jack tried to stand. But his suit was too bulky. He tried to roll over. But his suit made even that impossible.

“Oh, no,” he groaned. “Not again.”

“Are you here?” asked Annie. “Did you make it?”

“Yes!” Jack was relieved to hear her voice. But he couldn’t turn his head to see her. He could only hear her over the radio.

“Can you help me up?” he asked.

“Nope,” said Annie.

“Why not?”

“I fell down, too,” she said.

“Oh, brother,” Jack sighed. “Now we are really in trouble.”

He tried to stand again. And failed.

“Can you see anything?” he asked.

“Just the sky,” said Annie. “Wow, is it weird … ”

“I’m worried about our air tanks,” said Jack. “I feel like it’s been two hours.”

“Ja-ack … ” said Annie.

“And what about that moon man?” said Jack. “Where did he go to?”

“Jack!” whispered Annie.

“What?”

“He’s here,” she said. “The moon man is here.”

“What?”

“He’s standing above me.”



7. The Moon Man

Jack’s heart nearly stopped.

He could hear Annie talking.

“Hi,” she said. “We come in peace.”

There was silence. Then Jack heard Annie say, “Thank you. I have to help my brother up now.”

A moment later, Annie rolled Jack onto his back.

She grabbed his hand and pulled him up.

“Thanks,” said Jack, once he was standing.

The moon man was a few feet away. His face was hidden by a metal visor.

He looked like a spaceman. A huge spaceman—with a giant tank on his back. It was as big as a refrigerator.

“That’s a jet pack!” said Jack. “I’ve seen pictures of future astronauts flying with those things. It’s like a mini-spaceship. Right?”

The moon man didn’t answer.

“I don’t think he can hear us,” said Annie. “He’s not hooked up to our radio.”

“Oh, right,” said Jack. “I’ll write him a message!”

“Good idea,” said Annie.

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:





Jack handed the notebook and his pencil to the moon man. They looked tiny in his big hands.



The moon man looked down at the message. He looked at the tiny pencil. Then he turned the notebook over.

Jack and Annie watched as the moon man put the pencil to the paper. He was writing something very carefully.

Finally he gave the notebook back to Jack.

Jack and Annie stared at the marks.





“Stars,” said Annie. “He drew stars.”

“Maybe it’s a space map,” said Jack.

“Space map?” said Annie. “Hey, Jack, map starts with M!”

“Oh, wow,” said Jack. “This must be the fourth M thing!”

“Let’s ask him what his map means,” said Annie. She turned around.

“We’ll never know now,” she said.

“Why?” Jack looked up from the map.

“That’s why.” Annie pointed. The moon man was flying over the mountains.

“Thanks!” Annie cried.



8. One Star to Another

“Who was that guy?” said Jack. “What does his map mean?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But let’s see if it works.”

Jack took a deep breath. “Yeah, we’d better hurry back. I think I’m running out of air. It feels harder to breathe.”

“For me, too,” said Annie.

“Go slow. Don’t breathe too much,” said Jack.

He and Annie took long, floating steps toward the moon base. Jack held his breath as if he were underwater.

By the time they got to the white dome, he was ready to burst.

Annie pushed a button beside the huge door. It slid open. They hurried into the airlock. The door closed behind them and the door to the hallway opened.

Jack opened the visor of his helmet. He took a long, deep breath—and let it out. “Ahhhh!”

“Let’s get out of these suits,” said Annie.

“Good idea.” Jack was dying to free his arms and legs.

As they moved clumsily into the spacesuit storeroom, Jack felt heavy again.

He and Annie unlocked each other’s helmets, gloves, and boots, and pulled everything off. Then they stepped out of their bulky suits.

“Whew!” Jack said. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes.

It was great to be free—even if he no longer felt as light as a feather.

“Hurry! Peanut’s waiting!” said Annie.

She led the way down the steps to the bright landing chamber.

“Yay,” she said softly.

Jack was relieved to see the tree house still there. Soon they’d be heading home. He couldn’t wait.

Jack and Annie crawled through the tree house window.

“We’re back, Peanut!” said Annie.

Squeak! Peanut ran to the letter M.

“We missed you!” said Annie. She patted the mouse’s head. “We met a moon man.”

“Sorry, Peanut, but you have to move,” said Jack. “We have to put the map on the M.”

Annie gently lifted the mouse off the M.

Jack tore the star map out of his notebook. He placed it on the M, next to the mammoth bone, the mango, and the moonstone.

He sighed, then sat back on his heels. “Hand me the Pennsylvania book,” he said. They needed the Pennsylvania book to get back home.

There was silence.

Jack turned and looked at Annie.

“It’s not working, Jack,” she said. “The book’s not here.”

“What?” Was the map the wrong thing?

They looked around the tree house.

“It’s definitely not here,” said Annie.



“Oh, no.” Jack’s heart sank. He picked up the star map and stared at it.

Squeak, squeak. Peanut jumped out of Annie’s arms and scurried back to the letter M.

“I’ve got an idea,” said Jack. He reached into his pack and took out his pencil.

“What are you doing?” said Annie.

“You know how you draw a constellation?” said Jack. “You connect all the stars. What happens if we try that?”

He drew a line from one star to another. He kept drawing, until all the stars were connected.

“Let me see,” said Annie.

Jack held the paper out so they could both study it.

“It looks like a mouse,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.





“Is there such a thing as a mouse constellation?” said Annie.

“I don’t think so … ” said Jack.

Squeak.

Annie and Jack looked at Peanut. She was standing on the M.

“Oh, wow. Jack,” Annie whispered, “I think I know what the fourth thing is—”

Jack grinned. “Me too,” he said. “It’s a—”

“Mouse!” they said together.

Squeak! Squeak!

“Maybe the spell is—Moonstone, mango, mammoth bone, mouse!” said Annie.

Jack touched each M thing in turn as he whispered, “Moonstone, mango, mammoth bone, mouse.”

“Let’s say it over and over and see what happens,” said Annie.

Together, they chanted:

“Moonstone, mango,

mammoth bone, mouse.

Moonstone, mango,

mammoth bone, mouse.”



Suddenly, a bright light filled the tree house.

The light got brighter and brighter and brighter.

The brightness was blinding and whirling.

The air spun with brightness.

Then everything was clear.

Peanut the mouse was gone.

And Morgan le Fay stood before Jack and Annie.



9. Morgan

“Thank you,” Morgan said softly. “You have freed me from the magician’s spell.”

Jack just stared at her.

“You were Peanut?” Annie said.

Morgan nodded and smiled.

“Really? You were with us all the time?” said Jack. “On all our missions?”

Morgan nodded again.

“Why did we have to go on this mission to find a mouse?” said Jack. “If you were always with us?”

“To break the spell, we had to be on the moon,” said Morgan. “You could have broken it the minute we arrived.”

“Oh, that’s what Peanut—I mean you were trying to say!” said Annie. “We didn’t have to leave the moon base at all.”

Morgan nodded, smiling.

“But the moon man came along to help us,” said Annie. “He drew a constellation of a mouse! Is he a friend of yours?”

Morgan shrugged. “Let’s just say we had a little talk. He stopped by the moon base while you were out.”

“The same way you had a talk with the ninja master, right?” said Jack. “And the monkey and the sorcerer?”

Morgan nodded. “I always squeaked to the ones who helped you.”



“But how did they understand you—a mouse?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled again. “Certain wise ones understand the language of little creatures,” she said.

“I bet it was you who turned the pages of the books!” said Annie. “To show us where to go next!”

Morgan nodded.

“But who turned you into a mouse?” said Annie.

Morgan frowned. “A certain person who likes to play tricks on me,” she said. “His name is Merlin.”

“Merlin!” said Jack. “The greatest magician who ever lived.”

Morgan sniffed. “He’s not that great,” she said. “He doesn’t even know I have two brave friends who help me.”

“Us?” said Annie shyly.

Morgan nodded. “And I thank you both with all my heart.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack and Annie.

Morgan handed Annie the Pennsylvania book. “Are you ready to go home now?” she asked.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie.

Annie pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

But only for a moment.



10. Earth Life

The midnight woods woke up.

A breeze rustled the leaves.

An owl hooted.

The sounds were soft, but very alive.

Jack opened his eyes. He pushed his glasses into place.

He smiled. Morgan was still with them. He could see her in the moonlight. Her long white hair was shining.

“Morgan, can you and the tree house stay here?” said Annie. “In Frog Creek?”

“No, I must leave again, I’m afraid,” said Morgan. “I’ve been gone from Camelot for a long time.”

She handed Jack his pack. She brushed his cheek. Her hand felt soft and cool.

“A bit of moondust still on you,” she said. “Thank you, Jack, for your great love of knowledge.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack.

Morgan tugged on one of Annie’s braids. “And thank you, Annie, for your belief in the impossible.”

“You’re welcome,” said Annie.

“Go home now,” said Morgan.

Jack smiled. Home was Earth—that bright, colorful world where everything was alive and always changing.

“Bye, Morgan,” said Annie. She started out of the tree house.

Jack looked back at Morgan.

“Will you come back soon?” he said.

“Anything can happen,” said Morgan. “The universe is filled with wonders. Isn’t it, Jack?”

He smiled and nodded.

“Go now,” Morgan said softly.

Jack followed Annie down the rope ladder. He stepped onto the ground.

The wind started to blow.

The tree started to shake.

A loud roar filled Jack’s ears. He squeezed his eyes shut. He covered his ears.

Then everything was silent and still.

Jack opened his eyes. The ladder was gone. He looked through the leaves and branches of the giant oak tree. Where the tree house had been was only moonlight now.

“Bye, Morgan,” he whispered sadly.

“Bye, Peanut,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie stared at the top of the tree for a long moment.

“Ready?” said Annie.

Jack nodded.

They started for home.

The midnight air felt cool and moist. It was filled with the soft sounds of earth life.

Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods. They started down their street.

Annie glanced up at the sky. “The moon looks really far away, doesn’t it?”

It did, thought Jack. It was.

“I wonder how the moon man can be up there all alone,” said Annie.

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“I mean, who helps him put on his spacesuit?” said Annie. “Who helps him get up when he falls down?”

“And who is he?” added Jack.

“Who do you think he was?” said Annie.

“He must be a scientist or an astronaut from Earth,” said Jack.

“No. I think he’s an alien,” said Annie, “from another galaxy.”

Jack scoffed. “What makes you say that?”

“I just feel it,” said Annie.

“Wrong,” said Jack. “There’s no proof that aliens exist.”

“Maybe not now,” said Annie. “But don’t forget—we were in the future.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

They crossed their yard and climbed their back steps. Annie tiptoed inside the house. Jack followed her.

Before he shut the door, he glanced up at the moon.

Was Annie right? he wondered. Could the moon man have come from another galaxy?

Morgan’s words came back to him: The universe is filled with wonders. Isn’t it, Jack?

“Goodnight, moon man,” Jack whispered. Then he closed the door.

Jack stared out the kitchen window.

The sun was not up yet. But the sky was growing lighter.

Jack had been awake for a long time. He had been thinking about the dream he’d had—the dream about Morgan le Fay.

The tree house is back, Morgan had said. I’m waiting.

Jack wished that dreams were real. He missed Morgan’s magic tree house.

“Jack!” His little sister Annie appeared in the doorway. “We have to go to the woods now!” she said.

“Why?” Jack asked.

“I had a dream about Morgan!” exclaimed Annie. “She said the tree house is back and she’s waiting for us!”

“That was my dream,” said Jack.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “She told you, too? So it must be important.”

“But dreams aren’t real,” said Jack.

“Some dreams aren’t. But this one is,” said Annie. “I can just feel it.” She opened the back door. “I’ll see you later!”

“Wait—wait. I’m coming!” said Jack.

He raced up the stairs. Having the same dream must mean something, he thought.

He grabbed his backpack and threw his notebook and pencil into it.

Then he ran downstairs.

“We’ll be back soon, Mom!” Jack called into the living room.

“Where you going so early?” his dad called.

“Just for a quick walk!” said Jack.

“It rained last night,” called his mom. “Don’t get your shoes wet.”

“We won’t!”

Jack slipped out the door. Annie was waiting for him.

“Let’s go!” she said.

The sky was pale gray. The air felt freshly washed.

Jack and Annie ran up their quiet street to the Frog Creek woods.

They headed between the trees. Soon they came to the tallest oak in the woods. There was a wooden house high in the treetop.

“It is back!” whispered Jack.

Someone looked out the window of the tree house—a lovely old woman with long white hair. Morgan le Fay.

“Come up,” called the magical librarian.

Jack and Annie climbed up the rope ladder and into the tree house.

In the dawn light, they stared at Morgan le Fay. She looked beautiful in a red velvet robe.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He couldn’t stop smiling.

“We both had dreams about you!” said Annie.

“I know,” said Morgan.

“You do?”

“Yes, I sent them to you,” said Morgan, “because I need your help.”

“What kind of help?” said Jack.

“Merlin the Magician has been up to his tricks again,” said Morgan. “So I haven’t had any time to collect books for Camelot’s library.”

“Can we collect them for you?” asked Annie.

“Yes, but in order to gather books through time you must be Master Librarians,” said Morgan.

“Oh, well,” Annie said sadly.

“But you can become Master Librarians,” said Morgan, “if you pass the test.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“What kind of test?” Jack asked.

“You must show that you know how to do research,” said Morgan, “and show that you can find answers to hard questions.”

“How?” said Annie.

“By solving four riddles,” said Morgan. She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a rolled-up paper.

“The first riddle is written on this ancient scroll,” she said. “This book will help you find the answer.”

She held out a book. On the cover were the words Ocean Guide.



“This is where you have to go,” said Morgan.

“The ocean! Oh, boy!” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “I wish we—”

“Stop!” Jack grabbed Annie’s hand. “How will we know if we’ve found the right answer to the riddle?” he asked Morgan.

“You will know,” Morgan said mysteriously. “I promise you will know.”

Jack let go of Annie’s hand. She pointed again at the cover and finished her wish: “I wish we could go there.”

The wind started to blow.

“Are you coming with us, Morgan?” Jack said.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

Only the ancient scroll and the ocean book were left in her place.

Dear Reader,





While I was trying to decide what to do for book number nine, kids kept asking me to send Jack and Annie under the ocean.

“But how will they breathe and talk underwater?” I asked.

After a number of kids suggested a submarine, I began researching the subject and learned about mini-subs, and that settled it.

So, thanks to all the kids who’ve helped me—and keep helping me. I feel as if we’re all having these adventures together—you, me, Jack, and Annie.

Where do we go next? And what do you think will happen when we get there? Let me know … .

For Mattie Stepanek



1. Master Librarians

Jack stared out the kitchen window.

The sun was not up yet. But the sky was growing lighter.

Jack had been awake for a long time. He had been thinking about the dream he’d had—the dream about Morgan le Fay.

The tree house is back, Morgan had said. I’m waiting.

Jack wished that dreams were real. He missed Morgan’s magic tree house.

“Jack!” His little sister Annie appeared in the doorway. “We have to go to the woods now!” she said.

“Why?” Jack asked.

“I had a dream about Morgan!” exclaimed Annie. “She said the tree house is back and she’s waiting for us!”

“That was my dream,” said Jack.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “She told you, too? So it must be important.”

“But dreams aren’t real,” said Jack.

“Some dreams aren’t. But this one is,” said Annie. “I can just feel it.” She opened the back door. “I’ll see you later!”

“Wait—wait. I’m coming!” said Jack.

He raced up the stairs. Having the same dream must mean something, he thought.

He grabbed his backpack and threw his notebook and pencil into it.

Then he ran downstairs.

“We’ll be back soon, Mom!” Jack called into the living room.

“Where you going so early?” his dad called.

“Just for a quick walk!” said Jack.

“It rained last night,” called his mom. “Don’t get your shoes wet.”

“We won’t!”

Jack slipped out the door. Annie was waiting for him.

“Let’s go!” she said.

The sky was pale gray. The air felt freshly washed.

Jack and Annie ran up their quiet street to the Frog Creek woods.

They headed between the trees. Soon they came to the tallest oak in the woods. There was a wooden house high in the treetop.

“It is back!” whispered Jack.

Someone looked out the window of the tree house—a lovely old woman with long white hair. Morgan le Fay.

“Come up,” called the magical librarian.

Jack and Annie climbed up the rope ladder and into the tree house.

In the dawn light, they stared at Morgan le Fay. She looked beautiful in a red velvet robe.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He couldn’t stop smiling.

“We both had dreams about you!” said Annie.

“I know,” said Morgan.

“You do?”

“Yes, I sent them to you,” said Morgan, “because I need your help.”

“What kind of help?” said Jack.

“Merlin the Magician has been up to his tricks again,” said Morgan. “So I haven’t had any time to collect books for Camelot’s library.”

“Can we collect them for you?” asked Annie.

“Yes, but in order to gather books through time you must be Master Librarians,” said Morgan.

“Oh, well,” Annie said sadly.

“But you can become Master Librarians,” said Morgan, “if you pass the test.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“What kind of test?” Jack asked.

“You must show that you know how to do research,” said Morgan, “and show that you can find answers to hard questions.”

“How?” said Annie.

“By solving four riddles,” said Morgan. She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a rolled-up paper.

“The first riddle is written on this ancient scroll,” she said. “This book will help you find the answer.”

She held out a book. On the cover were the words Ocean Guide.



“This is where you have to go,” said Morgan.

“The ocean! Oh, boy!” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “I wish we—”

“Stop!” Jack grabbed Annie’s hand. “How will we know if we’ve found the right answer to the riddle?” he asked Morgan.

“You will know,” Morgan said mysteriously. “I promise you will know.”

Jack let go of Annie’s hand. She pointed again at the cover and finished her wish: “I wish we could go there.”

The wind started to blow.

“Are you coming with us, Morgan?” Jack said.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

Only the ancient scroll and the ocean book were left in her place.



2. The Reef

A breeze blew through the window. Sea gulls cried. Waves lapped the shore.

Annie picked up the riddle scroll. She unrolled it. Together she and Jack read the riddle:

Rough and gray as rock,

I’m plain as plain can be.

But hidden deep inside

There’s great beauty in me.

What am I?



“Let’s go find the answer,” said Annie.

She and Jack looked out the window. The tree house wasn’t in a tree. It was on the ground.



“Why is the ground pink?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But I’m going out there.”

“I’m going to do a little research first,” said Jack.

Annie climbed out of the tree house.

Jack picked up the ocean book and flipped through it.

He found a picture of a pink island surrounded by water. He read:

This is a coral reef. Corals are tiny sea animals. After they die, their skeletons remain. Over time, the reef builds up from stacks of coral skeletons.



“Oh, man, tiny skeletons,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“Jack! Jack! Come look at this,” cried Annie.

“What is it?”

“I don’t know. But you’ll love it!” she said.

Jack threw his notebook and the ocean book into his pack. He climbed out the window.

“Is it the answer to the riddle?” he called.

“I don’t think so. It doesn’t look very plain,” said Annie.

She was standing at the edge of the water. Beside her was a strange-looking machine.

Jack hurried over the bumpy coral to get a better look.

The machine was half on the reef and half in the clear blue water. It looked like a huge white bubble with a big window.

“Is it a special kind of boat?” asked Annie.

Jack found a picture of the machine in the ocean book. He read:

Scientists who study the ocean are called oceanographers. Sometimes they travel in small diving vessels called submersibles, or “mini-subs,” to study the ocean floor.



“It’s a mini-sub,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook.

“Let’s get inside it,” said Annie.

“No!” said Jack. Actually, he did want to see what the sub looked like inside. But he shook his head. “We can’t. It’s not ours.”

“Just a teeny peek,” said Annie. “It might help us figure out the riddle.”

Jack sighed. “Okay. But we have to be careful. Don’t touch anything,” he said.

“Don’t worry,” said Annie.

“And take off your shoes so they won’t get wet,” said Jack.

He and Annie slipped off their shoes and socks and threw them toward the tree house.

Then they stepped carefully over the sharp coral.

Annie turned the handle on the hatch of the mini-sub. It opened.

She and Jack climbed inside. The hatch slammed shut.

The mini-sub was tiny. Two seats faced the big window. In front of the seats was a computer built into a control panel.

Annie sat down.



Jack opened the ocean book and read more on the mini-sub page:

Mini-subs have strong hulls to keep air in and protect those aboard from water pressure. Computers are used to guide the mini-sub through the ocean.



“Oops,” said Annie.

“What’s wrong?” Jack looked up.

Annie was waving her hands in front of the computer. Now the screen showed a map.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“I just pressed a few keys—” said Annie.

“What? I said not to touch anything!” said Jack.

An air blower came on. The mini-sub jerked backward.

“Get out!” said Jack.

He and Annie scrambled for the hatch. Jack grabbed the handle.

But they were too late.

The mini-sub slid off the reef.

Then it dove silently down into the deep.


3. Mini-Sub


“You’ve really done it now, Annie!” said Jack.

“Sorry, sorry. But look out the window!” Annie said. “Look!”

“Forget it! We have to figure this out!” Jack stared at the computer. He saw a row of pictures at the top of the screen.

“What did you do?” he asked.

“I just pressed the ON button,” said Annie.



“The screen lit up. And I pressed the starfish.”

“That must be the command to go under the water,” said Jack.

“Yeah. Then the map came on,” said Annie.

“Okay, okay. The map shows the reef,” said Jack. “Look! There’s the mini-sub on the map! It’s moving away from the reef.”

“It’s like a video game,” said Annie. “I bet I know what to do.”

Annie pressed a key with an arrow pointing right. The mini-sub on the screen moved right. The real mini-sub turned to the right, also.

“Great!” said Jack with relief. “You press the arrows to steer the mini-sub. So now we can go back.”

“Oh, no, not right away,” said Annie. “It’s so beautiful down here.”

“We have to get back to the reef,” said Jack. His eyes were still glued to the computer screen. “What if the owners find it gone?”

“Look out the window,” said Annie. “Just for one teeny second.”

Jack sighed. He pushed his glasses into place and looked up. “Oh, man,” he said softly.

Outside the glass was a strange world of bright moving color.

It looked like another planet.

The mini-sub was moving past red, yellow, and blue coral—past little coral mountains, valleys, and caves—past fishes of every color and size.

“Can’t we stay a little while? The answer to Morgan’s riddle must be here,” said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly. She might be right, he thought. Besides, when would they ever get to visit a place like this again?



4. Fish City

There were fish everywhere: floating over the swaying sea grass, eating on the white sandy bottom, peeping out of coral caves.

Some kinds of coral looked like blue fingers or lacy fans. Others looked like deer antlers or lettuce leaves or mushrooms or trees.

Jack read in the book:

Coral reefs are only found in warm, tropical waters. Nearly 5,000 different species of fish live around coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.



Jack pulled out his pencil and notebook.

He started to write a list.



“Look!” said Annie.

The sub floated past a huge starfish. Then a pink jellyfish. Then a blue sea horse.

Jack added to his list:



“What is that?” said Annie.

Jack saw a creature that looked like a giant pancake with a long tail.

“A stingray!” said Jack. He put that on his list as well.

“And that?” said Annie.

She pointed at the biggest shell Jack had ever seen. It was as big as a footstool.

“I’ll have to check on that one,” said Jack. He turned the pages of the ocean book. When he got to the page about clams, he read aloud:

The giant clam of the coral reef is three feet wide and weighs up to 200 pounds.



“Wow,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack. He added “giant clam” to his list.

“Dolphins!” cried Annie.

Jack looked up. Two dolphins were peering in the window. They tapped their noses against the glass.

Their eyes were bright. They seemed to be smiling.

Jack laughed. “It’s like we’re in a fish tank—and they’re looking at us,” he said.

“Their names are Sukie and Sam,” said Annie. “Sister and brother.”

“You’re nuts,” said Jack.

“Here’s a kiss for you, Sukie,” Annie said. She pressed her lips to the glass as if she were kissing the dolphin’s nose.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But the dolphin opened her mouth and tossed her head. She seemed to be laughing.

“Hey, I know the answer to the riddle—dolphins!” said Annie. “They’re gray and plain. But they have great beauty inside.”



“You forgot the ‘rough as a rock’ part,” said Jack. “Dolphin skin looks smooth and slippery.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

The dolphins flipped their tails. They swam off into the light blue water.

“Wait! Don’t go!” called Annie. “Sukie!”

But the dolphins were gone.

“It’s time for us to go, too,” said Jack. He was afraid someone might be looking for the mini-sub.

“But we haven’t solved the riddle,” said Annie.

Jack studied the bright underwater world.

“I don’t see the answer,” he said. “There’s nothing plain at all out there.”

“Then maybe the answer’s in the mini-sub,” said Annie.

They looked around the tiny space.

“I’ll check the computer,” said Jack. He studied the row of pictures at the top of the screen.

He pressed the book picture.

The words SHIP’S LOG flashed onto the screen.



5. Two Eyes

“What’s a ship’s log?” said Annie.

“It’s a diary of an ocean trip,” said Jack.

He peered at the computer screen and read a log entry:

MONDAY, JULY 5



“Hey, that was just last week,” said Jack. He read further:

COLLECTED ROCK AND SHELL SAMPLES

MAPPED OCEAN FLOOR

FOUND TINY CRACK IN HULL



“This is like your notebook,” said Annie.

“Yeah, the oceanographer was writing notes on the computer,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie read further:

TUESDAY, JULY 6

CRACK HAS WIDENED

MUST RETURN TO REEF SOON



“A crack where?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He read further:

WEDNESDAY, JULY 7

MORE TINY CRACKS

CANNOT BE FIXED

HEADING BACK TO REEF TODAY



“Uh-oh. This doesn’t sound good,” said Jack. He read further:

THURSDAY, JULY 8

DEFECTIVE SUB

RETURN TO REEF

LEAVE FOR HELICOPTER TO TRANSPORT

TO JUNKYARD



“ ‘Defective’ means broken, right?” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“So this sub is broken, right?” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. “And it was waiting to be taken away by a helicopter. To a junkyard.”

“Yikes,” said Annie.

“Now we really have to get back,” said Jack.

“Let’s try pressing the waves picture,” said Annie.

She pressed the waves picture on the computer screen.



The mini-sub began to rise slowly.

“Oh, good,” said Jack.

The sub went past a small coral mountain. It went past schools of fish and waving plants.

“Oh!” gasped Annie.

Jack gasped, too.

Two eyes were staring out from behind a giant sea plant. They looked human—except they were as big as golf balls.

The sub moved past the giant plant. Jack breathed a sigh of relief.

“What—? Whose—?” sputtered Annie.

“Don’t ask,” said Jack.

They stared back at the plant.

Just then, a long arm came out from behind it.

Then another arm came out.

Then another—and another—and another—and another—and another—and another!

Jack and Annie stared in horror at a giant octopus.

“It’s coming after us,” said Annie.

Slowly, the octopus crept through the water. Its eight arms reached for the mini-sub.



6. C-R-A-C-K

The octopus hugged the mini-sub. Each of its eight arms had two rows of suckers. The suckers stuck to the window.

The mini-sub stopped.

The octopus stared at Jack and Annie with huge, human-like eyes.

“I don’t think it wants to hurt us,” whispered Annie. “It’s just curious.”

“I—I’m going to research it,” said Jack.

His hands shook as he flipped through the pages of the ocean book.

He found a picture of an octopus and read aloud:

The octopus tends to be a gentle, shy creature. Sometimes, though, curiosity gets the best of it and it comes out of hiding.



“Aw. See, I told you, he’s shy,” said Annie. She yelled to the octopus, “Hi! I’m Annie! He’s Jack!”

“Oh, brother,” moaned Jack. He read further:

But the octopus has huge strength. Each of its arms, or tentacles, has many suckers, which act like rubber suction cups. It is nearly impossible to free an object from their grasp.



“Oh, great,” said Jack. “We’ll never get rid of this thing.”

Just then, Jack felt a drop hit his arm. Water. He looked up at the ceiling.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie.

A thin crack ran along the ceiling. Smaller cracks branched out from it.

Water dripped from the cracks.

“We found the cracks,” said Annie.

“The octopus better let go! Before the whole ceiling breaks!” said Jack.

“Let go, please. Please!” Annie shouted at the octopus.

The creature blinked, as if trying to understand her.

“Please! Please! Please!” she shouted.

“Come on, Annie,” said Jack. “It doesn’t care if you’re polite.”

The octopus blinked at Jack.

“Get out of here!” Jack yelled at it. “Now! Beat it! Scram! Go!”

The octopus shot a cloud of black liquid into the water and disappeared into the dark cloud. Its long tentacles trailed through the water.

The mini-sub started to rise slowly again.

“You hurt his feelings,” Annie said.

“I don’t think so … ” Something bothered Jack.

He looked back at the ocean book. He read to himself:

The octopus squirts black ink to escape its enemies. One of its main enemies is the shark.



“Oh, no,” said Jack.

“What’s wrong?” asked Annie.

Jack looked out the window. The water was growing clear again.

A shadowy figure moved toward the mini-sub.

“What is that?” whispered Annie.

The fish was way bigger than the dolphins. And it had a very weird head.

Jack could feel his heart nearly stop.

“A hammerhead shark,” he breathed. “We’re really in trouble now.”



7. Remain Calm

The shark swam behind the coral.

“Where did it go?” said Annie, peering out the window.

“It doesn’t matter,” said Jack. “We have to get to the top.”

“More water’s coming in,” said Annie.

“Yeah, I know. Come on … come on … faster!” Jack ordered the mini-sub.

“Even more water’s coming in,” said Annie, “lots more!”

Jack looked up. The water wasn’t dripping now—it was spurting.

“A few seconds, a few seconds,” said Jack.

Suddenly, the mini-sub burst out of the water. It bobbed on the waves like a cork. The ocean sparkled all around it.

“Safe!” shouted Annie.

Jack felt the water rising around his bare feet.

“Uh—not really … ” he said.

“Oops,” said Annie. “The octopus must have made cracks in the bottom, too.”

The water was up to their ankles now.

Jack looked out. He saw the reef in the distance.

“The sub can make it. It doesn’t look that far,” he said.

“Go, go, go,” said Annie.

She pressed one of the steering keys.

Suddenly, the screen went blank.

“What’s happening?” said Jack.

Annie pressed the key again. Then Jack pressed the other pictures. Nothing happened.

“It’s dead,” said Annie.

“Oh, great,” said Jack.

Now the water was up to their knees.

“I guess we’ll have to swim,” said Jack. He took a deep breath.

“Right,” said Annie. “It’s a good thing we had swimming lessons this summer.”

“Right,” said Jack. “And it’s a bad thing we just saw a shark.”

Jack quickly found the picture of the shark in the book.

He read aloud:

If you ever see a shark in the water, don’t splash. Swim calmly away.



Jack closed the book.

“We better do the breast stroke,” said Annie. “So we won’t splash.”

“Yep, and stay close,” said Jack.

“Very close,” said Annie. Her eyes were wide. But she seemed very calm.

Jack took a deep breath. He tried to be calm, too. He calmly took off his glasses. He calmly put them and the book into his pack. He calmly put his pack on his back.

Annie opened the hatch.

“Be calm,” Annie said. She slipped out of the mini-sub.

“Help,” Jack said calmly. He held his nose.

Then he calmly lowered himself into the ocean.



8. Swim for Your Life!

Jack moved his arms slowly. He moved his legs slowly. He gently pushed the water out of his way as he did the breast stroke.

Calm, calm, he told himself.

Annie swam beside him. They headed for the reef.

All was calm.

Then Jack saw something out of the corner of his eye.

A dark fin was zigzagging through the water. It was heading toward them.

Jack wanted to splash. He wanted to yell. But he remembered: calm.

I better not tell Annie, he thought. She’ll stay calmer if she doesn’t know.

He began to swim faster—then faster. Annie went faster, too.

They both swam as fast, and as calmly, as they could.

Sometimes Annie went even faster than Jack, which made him swim faster. And faster.

Jack was so scared that he wasn’t tired at all. He was swimming for his life—and for Annie’s life, too.

He didn’t look back to see if the shark was still there. He didn’t want to know.

He just kept his eye on the tree house in the distance. And he kept swimming.

Jack and Annie swam and swam and swam.

It took forever for the tree house to get just a little closer.

Jack realized the reef was farther away than he had thought.

He kept swimming, but his arms and legs felt heavy.

Annie was struggling, too.

“Float!” she said. “Float!”

Jack and Annie turned onto their backs. They floated the way they had learned in swimming class.

We’ll just rest for a minute, Jack thought. Then we’ll keep going.

But the more Jack floated, the more tired he felt. Soon he was too tired even to float. He started to sink.

Then he felt something.

His heart stopped. Something pushed at him in the water.

It was slippery and alive.

Had the hammerhead caught up with them?

Jack shut his eyes and waited for the worst. He waited and waited. Finally, he opened his eyes.

In front of him was a shiny gray head—a dolphin’s head!

The dolphin pushed Jack with its nose. It made happy clicking sounds.

“Hooray!” cried Annie.

Jack looked over at her.

She was clinging to the fin of another dolphin! Her dolphin was moving through the water.

Jack grabbed the fin of his dolphin.

Then the two dolphins swam smoothly through the water, pulling Jack and Annie toward the reef.



9. Ouch!

The sun shone on the ocean. It sparkled like a diamond.

Jack felt safe now. His dolphin was taking good care of him.

The dolphins slowed down as they neared the reef.

Jack lowered his feet. He felt the bumpy coral. He let go of the dolphin’s fin and stood up in the water.

Annie stood, too.

Then she threw her arms around her dolphin and gave her a big hug.

“Thank you, Sukie!” she cried. And she kissed the dolphin’s nose.

Sukie tossed her head and clicked at Annie.

“Kiss Sam now!” Annie said to Jack.

“You’re nuts,” said Jack.

But Sam nuzzled Jack’s head. Then he put his flippers around Jack’s neck.

Jack couldn’t resist. He threw his arms around the dolphin and gave him a quick kiss.

Sam nodded and made clicking sounds like laughter. Then he turned to Sukie.

The two dolphins chattered to each other for a moment. They nodded at Jack and Annie and swam gracefully away.

“Bye, Sukie! Bye, Sam!” Annie shouted.

“Thanks!” Jack shouted.

The dolphins leapt high into the air. Then they dove back into the water with a SPLASH!

Jack and Annie laughed. “I wish we could swim like that,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie watched the dolphins until they disappeared.

“I miss them already,” Annie said softly.

“Me too,” said Jack.

He sat down in the shallow water.

“I’m really tired,” he said.

Annie sat beside him.

“Me too,” she said.

The warm water lapped around their shorts and T-shirts.

Jack pulled off his pack. He took out his glasses and put them on. They were blurry with water.

“Guess what,” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“I saw the shark when we were swimming,” Annie said. “But I didn’t tell you. I wanted you to stay calm.”

Jack stared at her. “I saw it, too. I just swam faster so you would swim faster.”

“And I swam faster so you would swim faster,” said Annie.

“I guess we swam double-fast then,” Jack said. He shook his head with wonder.

“What now?” said Annie.

“We go home,” said Jack.

“But we haven’t solved Morgan’s riddle yet,” said Annie.

Jack sighed.

He pulled his notebook out of his pack. It was soaked.

He pulled out the ocean book. It was soaked, too.

“We’ve failed,” he said. “My research is all wet. We’ll never be Master Librarians now.”

Jack put everything away. “Let’s go,” he said sadly.

He stood up. Then he started across the pink reef toward the tree house. Annie followed him.

“Ouch!” Annie said.

“What’s wrong?” Jack looked back.

“I stepped on something.” Annie bent down to rub her foot.

“What?” said Jack. “A shell?”

“Yeah, this … ” She picked up a large gray shell. “Boy, is it rough. Rough and gray as a rock—”

“And plain as plain can be!” whispered Jack. They had found the answer.

The shell looked like a clamshell—only bigger and with more ridges.

“How could this ugly shell be the answer to the riddle?” said Annie. “What about the part that says, ‘There’s great beauty in me’?”

“Wait—research,” said Jack. He opened the soaked ocean book.

The pages were stuck together. But he was able to turn a few.

He found a picture of the gray shell. He read:

Divers search for oysters in deep water. But sometimes oysters wash up on reefs or beaches. Inside some oysters you can find a pearl. The pearl’s natural beauty makes it a treasure.



“It must have a pearl inside it!” said Jack.



Annie peered into the crack between the two halves of the shell. “I can’t see anything,” she said. “How does a pearl get in there, anyway?”

Jack read aloud from the wet page:

Sometimes a grain of sand will get between the oyster’s shell and its skin. This irritates the oyster. So it makes a pearly material to surround the grain of sand. In this way, over a few years, a pearl is formed.



“I can’t tell if there’s a pearl in there or not,” said Annie.

“Maybe we should bang it against a rock,” said Jack.

“Now that would really irritate the oyster,” said Annie.

“Yeah.”

“Maybe we should just leave it alone,” said Annie.

She gently put the oyster back in the water.

“But how will we know if oyster is the right answer to the riddle?” said Jack.

“Morgan said we’ll know,” said Annie. “Come on.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place. Then he and Annie picked up their shoes and socks.

They climbed through the window of the tree house.

Morgan’s scroll was lying on the floor.

It was open.

“Look!” said Annie.

She and Jack stared at the scroll. The riddle had faded away.

In its place was one shimmering silver word:

OYSTER



“Morgan’s magic,” whispered Annie.

Jack let out a huge sigh. “We got it right,” he said.

“And here’s the Pennsylvania book,” said Annie. “Let’s go home.”

She opened the book. She pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there!” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. The True Pearl

Dawn light slanted into the tree house.

No time at all had passed since they’d left. Day was breaking.

Jack rolled up the ancient scroll. He tucked it into the corner.

“We solved the first riddle,” he said. “Three more to go.”

“I don’t see another scroll,” said Annie. “Maybe tomorrow we’ll get the next riddle.”

“That’s okay,” said Jack. “I think I need to rest—and dry out.”

His T-shirt and shorts were still soaked. His backpack, too. Only his shoes and socks were dry.

“And this needs to dry out, too,” said Annie. She put the wet ocean book in a patch of sunlight.

Then Jack and Annie climbed down the ladder.

They walked through the woods, through leafy shadows and golden light.

They left the woods and started down their street.

“You know, we should have found the answer to the riddle right away,” said Jack. “The oyster was on the reef all along.”

“I know, but we wouldn’t have had so much fun,” said Annie.



“Fun?” said Jack. “You call being squeezed by an octopus and chased by a shark fun?”

“Don’t forget the dolphins,” Annie said simply.

Jack smiled. “Right,” he said. The dolphins made up for everything. They were fun.

“I guess they were the true pearl in the oyster,” said Annie.

“Yep … ” said Jack. “I wonder what Sam is doing right now.”

“Sam?” Annie grinned at him. “You’re nuts,” she said.

They climbed their steps and went into their house.

“We’re back!” Annie shouted.

“Did you get your shoes wet?” their mom called.

“Not one bit,” called Jack. Then he and Annie slipped up the stairs to change their clothes.

Jack and Annie were sitting on the porch of their house. Annie was gazing down the street at the Frog Creek woods. Jack was reading a book.

“I have a feeling we should check the woods again,” said Annie.

“Why?” said Jack without looking up.

“A rabbit’s hopping by,” said Annie.

“So? We’ve seen rabbits before.”

“Not like this one,” said Annie.

“What do you mean?” Jack stood up and looked with her.

He saw a rabbit with very long legs hopping down their street. Soon the rabbit left the sidewalk and headed into the woods.

“He’s a sign,” said Annie.

“A sign of what?” said Jack.

“That Morgan’s back,” said Annie. She jumped off the porch. “Come on!”

“But what about dinner?” Jack said. “Dad said it would be ready soon.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “You know when we leave in the tree house, time stops.”

She ran across their yard.

Jack pulled on his backpack. “Back in ten minutes!” he called through the screen door. Then he followed Annie.

They hurried down their street and into the Frog Creek woods. The sun was setting above the trees.

“There he is!” said Annie.

The rabbit was standing in a ray of sunlight. When he saw them, he took off.

Jack and Annie followed the rabbit until he vanished behind the tallest tree.

“I told you! See?” said Annie, panting. She pointed up at the tree.

Morgan le Fay was waving to them from the magic tree house high in the branches.

Jack and Annie waved back to her. As always, Jack was very happy to see the enchantress librarian again.

“Come on up!” she called.

Annie and Jack started up the rope ladder. They climbed up to the tree house.

“We followed a strange rabbit here,” said Annie. “Is he your friend?”

“Perhaps,” said Morgan. She smiled mysteriously. “I have many odd friends.”

“Including us,” said Annie.

Morgan laughed. “That’s right.”

“How are you?” said Jack.

“I’m still having problems with Merlin,” said the enchantress, “which leaves me little time to do my real work. But soon you both will become Master Librarians, and that will be a big help to me.”

Jack smiled. He was going to be a Master Librarian who traveled through time and space. It was almost too good to believe.

“Are you ready to solve another riddle?” asked Morgan.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

“Good,” said Morgan. “First, you’ll need this for research … ”

She pulled a book from her robe and handed it to Jack. It was the book that would help them on their journey.

The title of the book was Days of the Wild West. On the cover was a picture of a western town on a prairie.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “The Wild West!”

Jack took a deep breath. Just how wild? he wondered.

Morgan reached into the folds of her robe again and pulled out a scroll. She handed it to Annie.

“Read this when the tree house lands,” she said.

“Is it the riddle?” asked Jack.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “Then you’ll only have two more to solve. Are you ready to go?”

Jack and Annie nodded. Annie pointed to the picture on the cover of the Wild West book.

“I wish we could go there,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

“Good-bye!” said Morgan. “Good luck!”

The tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

A fly buzzed around his head.

Dear Reader,





Over the past year, many of you have asked me to send Jack and Annie to the Wild West. I thought this was a good idea, but I wasn’t sure what should happen in the story.

Then one day, I received a letter from a girl named Alexandra, who lives in Washington. She suggested that Jack and Annie help a colt find his mother, who has been stolen by horse thieves.

What an excellent idea, I thought. Many thanks to Alexandra for helping me with this book.

Also, thanks to everyone who has written. More Tree House books are in the planning … so all your thoughts and suggestions are very welcome. Keep them coming!

1. How Wild?

Jack and Annie were sitting on the porch of their house. Annie was gazing down the street at the Frog Creek woods. Jack was reading a book.

“I have a feeling we should check the woods again,” said Annie.

“Why?” said Jack without looking up.

“A rabbit’s hopping by,” said Annie.

The tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

A fly buzzed around his head.



2. Rattlesnake Flats

The air was hot and dry.

Jack and Annie peeked outside.

The tree house had landed in a lone tree on a prairie. The sun was low in the sky.

Right in front of them was the town from the cover of the book. In real life it looked empty and spooky.

To one side of the town was a patch of ground with several tombstones.

“That’s creepy,” said Annie.



“Yeah,” said Jack. He took a deep breath. “What’s our riddle say?”

Annie held up the ancient scroll. She unrolled it. Then she and Jack read together:

Out of the blue,

my lonely voice

calls out to you.

Who am I? Am I?



Jack pushed his glasses into place and read the riddle again to himself.

“There must be a mistake,” he said. “ ‘Am I?’ is written twice.”

“Well, I don’t hear any voices now,” Annie said as she looked out the window.

There were no human sounds at all—only the buzzing of flies and the whistling of the dry wind.

“Let’s look at the book,” Jack said.

He opened the book. The pages were yellow with age. He found a picture of the town and read the words beneath it out loud:

In the 1870s, Rattlesnake Flats was a rest stop for the stagecoach that carried passengers from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Fort Worth, Texas. When the creek dried up, everyone left. By 1880, it was a “ghost town.”



“Wow, a ghost town,” said Annie, her eyes wide.

“Let’s take a quick look around,” said Jack. “So we can leave before dark.”

“Right,” said Annie. “Let’s hurry.” She started down the rope ladder.

Jack put the old book into his pack. Then he followed Annie down the ladder.

They stood by the tree and looked about. Tumbleweeds blew across the dry ground.

Suddenly something jumped past them.

“Yikes!” they both said.

But it was just a rabbit—a lone, long-legged rabbit hopping past them.

“Hey, he’s just like that rabbit we saw at home,” said Jack.

“Yeah, that rabbit must have been a sign of things to come,” said Annie.

The rabbit hopped across the prairie and out of sight.

“I’d better take notes,” said Jack.

He reached into his backpack and took out his notebook and pencil.

He wrote:



“What’s that sound?” said Annie.

“What sound?” asked Jack.

“That rattling sound!” said Annie.

Jack looked up. “What?” he said.

“There!” Annie pointed to a rattlesnake. It was about a hundred feet away. It was coiled up and rattling.

Jack took one look at the snake and ran. Annie ran, too. They ran past the graveyard and right into the ghost town.

“I guess that’s why this town is called Rattlesnake Flats,” said Annie when they stopped.

Jack looked around. The town was hardly big enough to call a town. There was one unpaved street and a few old buildings.

It was quiet, too quiet.

“Look, a store,” said Annie.

She pointed to a building. The faded sign said GENERAL STORE. “Let’s look inside. Maybe the answer to the riddle is in there.”

Jack and Annie stepped onto the porch. The wooden boards creaked loudly. The door had fallen off its hinges. They peeked inside.

The air was thick with dust. Spider webs hung from the ceiling.

“Maybe we shouldn’t go in,” said Jack.

“But what if the answer’s here?” said Annie. “Let’s just take a quick look.”

Jack took a deep breath. “Okay.”

He and Annie tiptoed into the store.

“Look,” said Annie. She picked up a pair of rusty spurs.

“Careful,” said Jack. He poked at other stuff in the store—an old feed sack, a rusted tin cup, a faded calendar dated 1878.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She held up two cowboy hats. She put one on and handed the other one to Jack. “For you.”

“It’s too dusty,” said Jack.

“Just blow on it,” said Annie.

Jack blew on his hat. A cloud of dust rose up. Jack sneezed.

“Just try it on!” said Annie.

Jack put the hat on. It nearly covered his eyes.

“Boots!” said Annie. She pointed to a row of cowboy boots on a shelf. “There are even some small ones, like our sizes. Here’s a pair for you.” She handed the boots to Jack.

“They’re not ours,” he said.

“I know, but just try them on,” said Annie.

Jack turned his boots upside down and shook them as hard as he could.

“What are you doing?” Annie asked, pulling on another pair of boots.

“Checking for scorpions,” Jack said.

“Ja-ack.” Annie laughed. “Try them on!”

Jack sighed. He pulled off his sneakers. He pushed his feet into the boots. He pushed and pushed. The boots were really stiff. Finally he got his feet inside. Then he tried to walk.



“Owww!” he said. “Forget it.” He started to pull off the boots.

“What’s that?” Annie said.

Jack froze.

“Piano music,” said Annie. “Maybe it’s the voice in the riddle! Come on!”

Jack threw his sneakers into his backpack and hobbled after Annie.



3. Player Piano

Outside, the sad tune played on.

“It’s coming from there,” said Annie.

She crept toward a building that had a sign with the word HOTEL on it. Jack limped after her.

Annie slowly pushed open a swinging door. They peeked inside.

The fading daylight lit a piano in the corner of the room. The keys were moving up and down. But no one was there!



“Yikes,” whispered Annie. “A ghost playing the piano!”

Suddenly the keys were still. The air got very cold.

“No. No way,” said Jack. “There’s no such thing as a ghost.”

“We saw one in ancient Egypt,” whispered Annie.

“Yeah, but that was ancient Egypt,” said Jack. Even so, his heart raced.

“I’ll look it up.” Jack pulled out the Wild West book. He found a picture of a piano. He read aloud:

Player pianos were popular in the Old West. The piano played automatically when someone pumped its floor pedals. Later, with the help of electricity, the piano played all by itself.



“Whew.” Jack closed the book. “I knew there was an answer,” he said. “It must be electric, and somehow it came on.”

“I didn’t know they had electricity in the Wild West,” said Annie.

“They didn’t,” said Jack.

He looked at Annie. “Oh, man, let’s get out of here!” he said.

Jack and Annie backed out of the hotel.

When they got outside, they heard another sound: horse hooves thumping against the hard ground.

A cloud of dust seemed to be moving toward the town. As it got closer, Jack saw three riders. They were herding a small band of horses.

“Hide!” Jack said.

“Where?” said Annie.

Jack looked around wildly. He saw two barrels outside the hotel.

“There!” he said.

Jack and Annie hurried to the empty barrels. Jack climbed inside one and tried to scrunch down. His hat wouldn’t fit! He jumped out of the barrel and threw his hat into the hotel.

“Mine, too!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed hers and threw it. Then he scrambled back into the barrel. Just in time.

Jack heard the horses thunder into town. He peeked through a crack in the barrel and saw a blur of cowboys and horses go by.



“Whoa!” “Whoa!” “Whoa!” men shouted.

Jack heard the horses come to a halt. They stamped and snorted. All he could see were shadows through the crack.

Dust covered Jack. He had to sneeze. He pinched his nose.

“The creek bed must have dried up!” a cowboy yelled. “This town’s a ghost!”

“Yup, it gives me the shivers,” said another. “Let’s camp over the rise.”



Jack really had to sneeze now. He pinched his nose tighter. But he couldn’t stop the sneeze. He let out a choked “Ah-choo!”

“What was that?” someone said.

Just then a loud whinny split the air. Jack saw a beautiful horse rear up.

She had no rider or saddle, just a rope around her neck. She was as red as the sunset. She had a wild black mane and a white star above her eyes.

“We can’t keep fighting this one, boss!” a cowboy yelled.

“Yup. She wants her colt,” another said. “We shouldn’t have left him behind.”

“He was too slow,” a growly voice said. “We’ll sell her when we cross the border.”

That’s terrible! thought Jack. He knew Annie must be upset, too. He just hoped that she wouldn’t jump out of her barrel.

But the cowboys pulled the red horse away. The ground rang from the pounding of hooves as they galloped off.

Jack and Annie stood up. They watched the riders disappear into the dust.

The pounding faded away. All was quiet again, except for the lazy buzzing of flies.

“They were mean to that horse,” Annie said in a low, angry voice.

“I know. But there was nothing we could do,” said Jack. His boots were killing him. He climbed out of his barrel.

“Man, I have to get these off,” he said.

Jack sat down on the porch of the hotel. He grabbed the foot of one boot and pulled.

“Jack,” said Annie, “I think there is something we can do.”

“What?” Jack looked up.

A small horse was running down the road. He was as red as the wild mother horse. He had the same black mane and white star above his eyes.

A rope was around his neck. He looked very lost.



4. Hands Up!

“It’s the colt!” said Annie. “He’s looking for his mother!”

She ran toward the wild-eyed little horse.

“Wait!” called Jack. “Oh, brother.” He pulled the book out of his pack.

He found a chapter titled “Horses of the Wild West.” He started reading.

At the end of the 1800s, over a million wild horses, called mustangs, wandered the West. These tough, fast horses were descendants of runaway Spanish horses. Mustang herders captured them and sold them to ranchers. Breaking a wild mustang took great skill.



Jack turned the page. There was a picture of a herd of horses. Two of them even looked like the beautiful mare and her colt.

“Hey, Annie,” Jack called. “You should see this picture.”

Annie didn’t answer.

Jack looked up.

Annie was trying to get close to the young mustang, but he kept darting away.

“Watch it! He’s wild!” said Jack.

Annie was speaking softly to the colt.

She slowly reached out and grabbed the end of his rope. Still talking to him, she led him to a broad wooden post.

“Stop! Don’t do anything!” said Jack.

He flipped the pages of his book. He found a section called “How to Treat a Horse.”

The basic rules on how to treat a horse are simple: a soft hand, a firm voice, a sunny attitude, praise, and reward.



“I’ve got the rules!” shouted Jack. “Don’t do anything before I write them down!”

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:



“Okay, listen—” Jack looked up.

But Annie was already sitting on the colt’s back!

Jack froze. He held his breath.

The mustang whinnied and pawed the ground. He snorted and tossed his head.

Annie kept patting his neck and talking softly.

Finally the young horse grew still.

Annie smiled at Jack. “I named him Sunset,” she said.

Jack let out his breath.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. “We have to take him to his mom.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “We have to solve our riddle. It’ll be dark soon. And those guys were real bad guys, I could tell.”

“We don’t have any choice,” said Annie.

“Oh, brother.” Jack knew she wouldn’t change her mind. “Let’s see what the book says.” He read more about mustangs:

Wild mustangs live together in families. The bond between a mare and her young is very strong. His sounds of distress or hunger will always bring her to him. A mustang cannot bear to wander alone.



Jack groaned. He looked at Sunset. The young mustang did have a sad look in his eyes.

“Okay, we’ll make a plan,” he said. “But first I have to get out of these boots.”

Jack grabbed one of his boots and pulled.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

“I can’t even think in these things!” said Jack.

He huffed and puffed and pulled. Then a deep voice stopped him cold: “Hands up—or I’ll shoot!”

Jack let go of his boot. He raised his hands in the air. So did Annie.

A cowboy rode out of an alley. His face was bony and tanned. He was riding a gray horse and pointing a six-shooter.

“I reckon you’re the smallest horse thieves I’ve ever come across,” he said.



5. Slim

“We’re not horse thieves!” said Annie.

“Well then, what are you doing with my horse here?” he said.

“Some bad guys came through town with his mother,” said Annie. “They left him behind because he was too slow.”

“Yup, must be the rustlers that stole my last five mustangs,” the cowboy said.

“Who are you?” said Jack.

“I’m a mustang herder,” the cowboy said.

“They rode through town. Then Sunset showed up all alone,” said Annie. “We’re taking him to his mother.”

“Sunset?” the cowboy said.

“Yup,” Annie smiled. “I named him.”

The cowboy put away his six-shooter. “Well, you’re pretty brave to try and rescue him, Smiley,” he said.

“Thanks,” said Annie.

Jack cleared his throat. “A mustang needs his family,” he said. “The bond between a mare and her young is very strong.”

The cowboy looked at Jack. “Whoa, you’re pretty smart to know that, Shorty.”

“Shorty?” said Jack.

“Every cowpoke’s got to have a nickname,” said the cowboy.

“What’s yours?” said Annie.

“Slim,” said the cowboy. “My name is Slim Cooley. And this is Dusty.” He patted his horse.

“That fits,” said Annie.

Jack agreed. Slim was slim. And Dusty was dusty.

“So tell me,” Slim said. “How did you two brave, smart young’uns end up in Rattlesnake Flats?”

Jack caught his breath. He didn’t know how to explain it.

“Um … the stagecoach,” said Annie. “We begged the driver to let us off. But I think we made a mistake.”

Slim looked around. “I’ll say,” he said.

“When the next stage comes through, we’re leaving,” said Annie.

“I see,” said Slim. “Well, I’m going to take my colt now and find those rustlers. You didn’t hear where they were headed, did you?”

“They said they were going to camp over the rise,” said Jack.

“Hmm, must be over yonder,” said Slim. He looked at a low rise in the distance. The sun was a red ball above it.

“Better get going before dark,” he said.

“Can we go with you?” said Annie.

“No, we have to stay here,” Jack said quickly. Now that Slim could help Sunset, Jack wanted to look for the answer to the riddle. Plus, he still wanted to take off his boots.

“Shorty’s right to be scared,” Slim said to Annie. “This is no job for young’uns.”

“Scared?” said Jack.

“Oh, please! I want to go,” said Annie.

Slim looked at Jack. “And what do you want, Shorty?”

For starters, he wanted Slim to stop calling him Shorty. And he wanted Slim to think he was brave.

“Sure, I want to go,” said Jack.

“What about your stagecoach?” asked Slim.

“It’s not coming until tomorrow,” Annie said quickly.

“Well … ” Slim scratched his chin. “I reckon I could use some brave, smart help. But you have to do everything I say.”

“We will!” said Annie. “Can I ride Sunset?”

“I wouldn’t say ‘yes’ to many kids, Smiley, but you seem to have a knack with horses,” said Slim. “Now, hang on tight to his mane, I’ll just pull him along behind me.”

Slim slipped the rope off the post. Then he held his hand out to Jack.

“Put your foot in the stirrup, Shorty. And grab my hand,” said Slim.

Jack did as Slim said. Slim pulled him onto the front of his saddle.

Jack held on to the saddle horn.

“Sit tight,” said Slim. “It’s not far.”

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty took off with Sunset right behind him.

Jack bounced up and down. His boots hurt. The sunlight blinded him.

“Giddy-up!” said Slim.

“Giddy-up!” said Annie.

The horses galloped across the prairie, dust flying from their hooves.

“Ah-choo!” Jack sneezed as he bounced along into the setting sun.



6. Split the Wind

The sky was dark by the time they got to the rise. The wind was cool, almost cold.

“Whoa,” said Slim.

Dusty slowed to a halt.

“They’re camped down there,” Slim said in a low voice. “In that patch of trees.”

Jack saw a campfire at the bottom of the slope. He saw the horses gathered in a dark clump. One let out a loud whinny.

“Hear that?” said Slim. “The mare. She senses Sunset is nearby.”

The mare whinnied again.

“Sounds like she’s tied to a tree,” said Slim. “I think the rest of the herd are loose.”

“What’s our plan?” whispered Jack.

“Smiley, you stay here and guard Sunset,” said Slim.

“Right,” said Annie.

“Shorty, you and I ride down near their camp,” said Slim. “You keep Dusty quiet while I cut the mare loose.”

How do you keep a horse quiet? wondered Jack.

“Once the mare’s loose, she’ll break for Sunset,” said Slim. “Then you and Sunset take off, Smiley.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

“Then we’ll split the wind,” said Slim.

What’s that mean? wondered Jack.

“Till we get to Blue Canyon,” said Slim.

Where’s that? wondered Jack.

“All set? Any questions?” asked Slim.

“Nope,” said Annie cheerfully.

Yup, about a million, thought Jack.

“Okay, pardners,” said Slim. “See ya soon, Smiley. Come on, Shorty.”

“Have fun,” said Annie.

Fun? thought Jack. Is she nuts? Our lives are at stake.

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty started down the rise. Their way was lit by a nearly full moon and a million stars.

Maybe now I can ask Slim some questions, thought Jack.

But just then voices came from the rustlers’ camp. They were mean voices, followed by mean laughter.

A chill went through Jack.

Dusty halted.

“This is far enough,” whispered Slim. He slipped off of Dusty.

“Keep him here,” Slim whispered to Jack, “and keep him quiet.”

“Wait—” whispered Jack. He needed more information.

But Slim was gone.

Jack gripped the reins and held his breath. He hoped Dusty wouldn’t do anything.

For a moment Dusty was still. But then he snorted and began walking.

Oh, no! thought Jack. He tried to think of the rules on how to treat a horse.

He remembered: a soft hand, a firm voice.

He patted Dusty softly.

“Whoa!” he said firmly. To his surprise, Dusty froze and was quiet.

Jack remembered another rule: a sunny attitude. He patted Dusty again. “Don’t worry,” he whispered. “Everything’s going to be fine.”

Just then a loud whinny came from the herd of mustangs. They began moving up the moonlit slope.

“Hey! The horses!” a rustler shouted.



A gun went off. Jack ducked.

“Come on, Shorty!” came Slim’s voice.

Jack looked up. Slim was riding the mare!

Jack was shocked. He had thought that Slim was coming back to ride Dusty.

Instead, Slim rode right past him! As he got close to Annie, she took off on Sunset.

The mare galloped after Sunset. And the band of mustangs galloped after the mare.

Bang! Bang!

Jack snapped the reins. “Go, Dusty!” he said.

Dusty leaped after the mustangs. Jack nearly fell off. He clutched the reins in one hand and the saddle horn in the other.

Bang! Bang!

The rustlers were on their horses now. They were getting closer.

“Hurry!” Jack cried.

Dusty cleared the rise in an awkward leap. Jack started to slip out of the saddle. He let go of the reins and tried to hold on to the saddle horn, but his weight pulled him down. He closed his eyes as he fell to the ground.

Bang! Bang!

Oh, man, thought Jack, this is the end.

He opened his eyes. Dusty was looking at him. Jack scrambled up and tried to climb back into the saddle. It was hard without Slim’s help.

As Jack struggled, he heard shouts from the rustlers. Their horses gave high-pitched neighs.

Jack looked back.

A shimmering white figure was moving across the top of the rise! The rustlers’ horses were panicking and backing away.

Jack didn’t have time to think about what he was seeing. He knew it might be his only chance to escape. Using all his strength, he pulled himself into the saddle.

“Go, Dusty, go!” he shouted.

Dusty took off at full gallop over the prairie. Jack held on for dear life as they split the wind.



7. Ghost Story

Jack bounced in the saddle. He felt the cool night wind against his face.

He couldn’t tell where they were going. But he trusted Dusty to follow the others.

Finally Dusty caught up with the herd as they began to slow down.

Jack snapped his reins. Dusty came up beside Slim and Annie.

“Howdy!” said Slim.

“Howdy!” said Jack.

“Howdy!” said Annie. “Are you okay?”

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “Yup,” he said. “You?”

“Yup,” she said.

“That was some good riding, Shorty!” said Slim.

“Thanks,” said Jack, smiling. He even liked being called “Shorty” now.

“Where we headed, boss?” Jack asked Slim.

“Blue Canyon,” said Slim. “Okay with you?”

“Yup,” said Jack.

“This way!” said Slim. He slapped his horse and they all speeded up again.

Slim steered the herd to the left. Soon he led them through a deep, narrow pass.

Finally they came to a boxy open space surrounded by walls of rock and lit by moonlight.

“We’ll corral the mustangs here in Blue Canyon,” Slim said.

He got off his horse. He helped Jack down. Annie slipped off Sunset.

“Take him to his ma,” Slim told Annie.

Annie led Sunset to the mare. In the moonlight, the two mustangs rubbed against one another and neighed.

As Jack patted Dusty’s damp neck, he remembered the last two rules: praise and reward.

“Thanks,” he whispered to Dusty. “You were great. You were super great.”

Slim unsaddled Dusty, then handed Jack his saddle bags.

“Take those over to that grassy spot. We’ll camp there,” he said.

As Jack carried the saddlebags, his boots felt stiff and tight. His legs were sore and wobbly. But he didn’t mind.

He threw down the saddlebags and his backpack. Then he flopped himself down. He was very tired. Annie joined him.

“They seem so happy to be free and together again,” she said, gazing at the moonlit mustangs.

“Yup,” said Jack.

He lay back, using his backpack as a pillow. He looked up at the stars.

“If we just had the answer to the riddle, everything would be perfect,” he said.

“Yup,” said Annie.

“Hey, Slim,” he called. “I have a question for you.”

“Shoot,” said Slim.

“Do you know the answer to this riddle?” Jack asked. “Out of the blue, my lonely voice calls out to you. Who am I? Am I?”



Slim was silent for a moment, then said, “Sorry, Shorty, don’t know that one.”

Jack’s heart sank. “That’s okay,” he said. “We don’t either.”

“I have a question, too,” said Annie. “Why does the piano in the hotel play by itself?”

“I do know the answer to that one,” said Slim.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“It’s Lonesome Luke,” said Slim. “He’s a ghost of a cowboy who wanders the prairie.”

Jack sat straight up.

“I saw him! I saw him!” he said. “I just remembered! He scared the rustlers! If he hadn’t come, I never would have gotten away!”

“Oh, yeah?” Slim chuckled. “Well, lucky for us, Lonesome Luke sometimes likes to help folks out.”

Slim threw his saddle down next to Jack and Annie and sat against it.

“Years ago, Lonesome Luke had a gal who he was just crazy about,” said Slim. “She couldn’t take the Wild West, though. So she went back east.”

“What happened then?” asked Jack.

“Luke went loco. Every night he’d show up at the hotel and play the piano. He played ‘Red River Valley’ over and over.

“Then one night he just vanished into the prairie and was never seen alive again. His bones were found a year later. But folks say his ghost returns to the hotel piano to play ‘Red River Valley.’ It goes like this … ”

Slim took out a harmonica. He began to play a song. It was the same sad song Jack and Annie had heard in the hotel.

Jack lay back down and listened to the lonesome tune. A coyote howled in the distance. The horses stirred in the dark.

I better take some notes, thought Jack.

But he didn’t write a word before he fell asleep. He didn’t even take off his boots.



8. Who Am I?

A fly buzzed by Jack’s ear. He slapped it away. He opened his eyes.

The sun was high above the canyon walls. He had slept a long time.

Slim and Annie were sitting by a fire, drinking from tin cups.

“Coffee? Biscuit?” Annie asked Jack.

“Where did you get them?” said Jack.

“A cowboy always carries biscuits and a canteen of coffee,” said Slim.

He walked over and gave Jack a biscuit and a cup of coffee.

“It’s hard as a rock,” Slim said. “And bitter as muddy river water. But a cowboy takes what he can get.”

Jack took a bite and a sip.

The biscuit was very hard and the coffee was very bitter. But that was okay with Jack. Since cowboys didn’t mind, he didn’t mind, either.



“I’ll saddle up Dusty,” Slim said, “and take you back to town to catch your stage.”

“Then what will you do?” said Annie.

“Head south with my herd,” said Slim. “Sell ’em. Then ride across the plains and round up more mustangs.”

While Slim saddled Dusty, Jack took out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:



“Hey, Shorty,” called Slim. “What are you doing?”

“Taking notes,” said Jack.

“What for?”

“He likes writing things down,” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah?” said Slim. “Me too. In fact, I first came out west to write a book. But one thing led to another. The next thing I know, I’m a mustang herder.”

“Slim, you should write your book,” said Annie. “And let the mustangs go free.”

“Think so?” said Slim.

They looked at the grazing wild horse.

“I know so,” said Annie.

“Yup,” said Jack. “Your book should be about the Wild West, Slim.”

Slim kept staring at his herd. “Maybe you’re right,” he said. “I could settle in Laramie and write there. Wouldn’t have to chase after rustlers anymore.”

Slim turned back to Jack and Annie. “Yup, I think I’ll be a writer. Let’s go. Before I change my mind,” he said.

“Yay!” said Annie. “I’ll go tell them.” She jumped up and ran to the mustangs.

Jack packed his backpack, while Slim packed his saddlebags.

Then Slim and Jack climbed onto Dusty. They rode over to Annie, who was stroking Sunset’s neck.

“I told him he’s as free as the wind now,” said Annie.

“Sounds good,” said Slim. “Give me your hand, Smiley.”

Slim pulled Annie onto Dusty. She sat in front of Jack.

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty started off.

The sun was hot as Dusty climbed out of the canyon. When they reached the top, they peered down at the canyon floor.

The mustangs pranced playfully, their coats shining in the hazy light.

“They’ll find their way out soon,” Slim said. “Then cut across the prairie. Yell goodbye to your pal, Smiley.”

“Stay with your mother, Sunset!” shouted Annie. “Good-bye!”

Out of the blue, a voice called, “Bye!”

Annie gasped. “Who said that?” she asked. “The ghost?”

“Nope,” said Jack. “It’s just an echo. It’s caused by sound bouncing off the canyon walls.”

Slim cupped his hands around his mouth. “Who am I?” he shouted.

“Am I?” came the distant voice.

“Oh, man,” Jack said softly. “That’s the answer … ”

“To Morgan’s riddle!” said Annie.

“Echo!” she and Jack said together.

Jack looked at Slim. “You knew the answer last night,” he said.

Slim just smiled and snapped his reins. “Let’s go, pardners,” he said.



9. Lonesome Luke

The sun was low in the sky when they reached Rattlesnake Flats.

“Just let us off in front of the hotel,” said Annie.

“You sure the stage is coming through here?” said Slim.

“Yup,” said Jack and Annie together.

In front of the hotel, Slim got down from Dusty. Then he helped Jack and Annie down.

“I hope you’ll come to Laramie and visit me,” said Slim. He winked. “I might be needing some help on my book.”

“Sure,” said Annie.

Slim climbed back on Dusty. He looked down at Jack.

“You know, Shorty,” he said, “you might be short, but you’re mighty tall in the brains.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“And, Smiley,” Slim said. “Your great courage is nothing to smile about.”

“Thanks,” said Annie.

“Good luck with your writing, Slim,” said Jack.

“I’m grateful to you both for steering me straight,” said Slim. “I promise I’ll thank you someday.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“A cowboy never goes back on his word,” said Slim. Then he snapped his reins, and Dusty loped down the street.

“Bye, Slim!” yelled Annie.

Slim Cooley turned one last time. He waved his hat. “So long, pardners!” he called.

Then he rode off into the sunset.



Jack let out a deep sigh. “Okay. I’m ready to take my boots off now,” he said.

“Me too,” said Annie.

They sat down on the porch of the hotel. They started pulling off their boots.

“There!” Jack got them both off.

He wiggled his toes. He took his sneakers out of his pack and put them on. Annie put hers on, too.

“Man, sneakers never felt so good,” said Jack.

Suddenly the sound of a piano drifted through the air.

“Lonesome Luke!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed his pack. He and Annie crept across the porch. They pushed open the swinging door.

The piano was playing “Red River Valley.” Sitting on the piano stool was the dim but shimmering shape of a cowboy.

Just then the ghost of Lonesome Luke looked at Jack and Annie. He waved a shimmering hand.

Jack and Annie waved back.

Then the ghost of Lonesome Luke faded away. Cold air wafted past Jack and Annie. They both shivered.

“Oh, man, let’s go,” breathed Jack.

They leaped and dashed up the dusty road. They ran across the cracked ground and past the graveyard. They ran until they reached the tree with the Magic Tree House in it.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder.

She hurried up and Jack followed. They were out of breath when they got inside the tree house.

Annie grabbed the ancient scroll. She unrolled it.

“Yay!” she said.

The scroll had one glowing word on it:

ECHO



“We got it right!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Echo from the Past

Jack and Annie looked outside.

The sun had slipped behind the trees of the Frog Creek woods.

Annie still held the ancient scroll. She put it in the corner, next to the scroll from their ocean trip.

“Just two more to go,” she whispered.

“Yup,” said Jack. He unzipped his pack. He pulled out Days of the Wild West. He put it on top of a stack of books.

“Ready?” he said.

Annie was staring at the books. Her mouth dropped open.

“What’s wrong?” asked Jack.

Annie just kept staring.

“Have you gone nuts?” said Jack.

Annie pointed at the Wild West book.

“Read the cover,” she said.

Jack picked the book up. He read the title aloud: “Days of the Wild West.” He looked at Annie. “So?”

“Keep reading,” said Annie.

The author’s name was below the title. It was in smaller letters. Jack read: “Slim Cooley.”

Jack gasped. His mouth dropped open. He and Annie stared at the words for a long moment.



“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We were using Slim’s book. The book he wrote after he left us!”

Jack and Annie shook their heads with wonder.

Jack opened Slim’s book. He looked at the title page. At the bottom of the page, he read: Texas Press, Dallas, 1895.

Jack turned the page. He read the dedication:

WITH THANKS TO SMILEY AND SHORTY,

TWO STRANGERS WHO CHANGED MY LIFE



Jack looked at Annie. “Slim dedicated his book to us,” he said.

“Yup,” said Annie. She smiled.

Jack placed Slim’s book back on the stack of books.

Then he and Annie left the tree house and climbed down the ladder.

As they started through the woods, the trees were alive with bird sounds. The air felt soft and moist.

“Frog Creek seems so peaceful,” said Jack. “No rattlers, no rustlers, no ghosts.”

“Yeah, but no Slim Cooley, either,” said Annie sadly.

“I know,” said Jack. “But when we read his book, it’s like he’s still talking to us.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie. “You mean it’s like an echo from the past?”

“Yeah,” said Jack softly. “Wow.”

Just then, out of the blue, a voice called, “Jack! Annie!”

“It’s Dad!” said Annie.

“Coming!” she and Jack shouted.

Then they ran all the way home, through the long shadows of the setting sun.





Here are the words to

RED RIVER VALLEY,

the traditional cowboy song that

Lonesome Luke played on the piano.





From this valley they say you are going.

I shall miss your sweet face and bright smile.

For they say you are taking the sunshine

That has brightened my pathway awhile.





Refrain (after each verse):





Come and sit by my side if you love me.

Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

For remember the Red River Valley

And the cowboy who loved you so true.





There never could be such a longing

In the heart of a poor cowboy’s breast.

As dwells in this heart you are breaking

While I wait in my home in the West.





Do you think of this valley you’re leaving,

Oh, how lonely and dreary it will be?

Do you think of the kind hearts you’re grieving,

And the pain you are causing to me?





From this valley they say you are going.

I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.

For they say you are weary and tired

And must find a new range for a while.

Jack and Annie were walking home from the grocery store. Jack’s pack was heavy. It held a big jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread.

“Are you going to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” said Annie. “Or a peanut butter and honey sandwich?”

Jack started to answer, but stopped.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“Look at that!” said Jack.

He pointed to the edge of the Frog Creek woods. In the shadows stood a small, delicate animal. It looked like a tiny deer.

“It’s a sign,” whispered Annie. “Remember when we saw the rabbit? He was a sign of the Wild West.”

The deerlike creature leaped into the woods.

Jack and Annie didn’t stop to think. They followed as fast as they could. Jack’s heavy pack thumped against his back as he ran.

Finally, they stopped and looked around.

“Where did she go?” he said.

“I don’t see her,” said Annie.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She pointed up.

There was the magic tree house. It was shining in the noon sun, at the top of the tallest tree in the woods. Its rope ladder swayed in the shadows below.

“Where’s Morgan?” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay wasn’t waving at them from the window. She wasn’t even at the window.

“I don’t know. Let’s go up,” said Jack.

They climbed the ladder and went into the tree house.

Sunlight streamed through the window. It lit a stack of books and two scrolls in the corner. The ancient scrolls held the answers to riddles Jack and Annie had solved earlier.

Jack took off his heavy pack.

“Did Morgan leave us a third riddle?” said Annie.

“Looking for someone?” said a soft voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around.

“Morgan!” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay had appeared out of nowhere. She looked ancient and lovely in the bright light.

“Do you still want to become Master Librarians?” she asked Jack and Annie. “So you can help me in my work?”

“Yes!” they said together.

“Wonderful,” Morgan said. Then she reached into her robe and pulled out a scroll.

“You’ve solved two riddles so far,” she said. “Here is your third.” She handed the scroll to Annie. “And for your research—”

She pulled a book out from her robe and handed it to Jack. The book’s cover said THE PLAINS OF AFRICA.



“Africa?” said Jack. “Oh, man, I’ve always wanted to go there.”

He opened the book. He and Annie stared at a picture.

It showed hordes of zebras, tall giraffes, big animals with horns, and tiny, deerlike creatures.

“Hey, that’s the animal that led us here!” said Annie.

“A Thomson’s gazelle, I believe,” Morgan said.

“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

“You’ll find out,” said Morgan.

“Um … maybe we need to plan this trip,” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “No. Go ahead. Make your wish now.”

Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

“Be careful,” said Morgan. “Just keep an eye out.”

“For what?” said Jack.

“The lions, of course,” she said.

“Wait!” said Jack.

Too late.

The wind had started to blow.

The tree house had started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

Your letters continue to help me write the Magic Tree House series.

One day while I was writing Lions at Lunchtime, I got stuck—I couldn’t figure out what should happen when Jack and Annie get caught by the Masai warrior. Finally, I decided to take a break and read some letters from you. I read a letter from a boy named Mark, who lives in Massachusetts. He had written to suggest that Jack and Annie decide to visit the tree house on their way home from the grocery store. A light bulb went on in my head, and I figured out a way Jack and Annie could make friends with the warrior.

Thank you, Mark. Thanks to all you readers. Your enthusiasm for the series keeps me writing more books.





All my best,

To Shana Corey,

with appreciation for all her help



1. Before Lunch

Jack and Annie were walking home from the grocery store. Jack’s pack was heavy. It held a big jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread.

“Are you going to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” said Annie. “Or a peanut butter and honey sandwich?”

Jack started to answer, but stopped.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“Look at that!” said Jack.

He pointed to the edge of the Frog Creek woods. In the shadows stood a small, delicate animal. It looked like a tiny deer.

“It’s a sign,” whispered Annie. “Remember when we saw the rabbit? He was a sign of the Wild West.”

The deerlike creature leaped into the woods.

Jack and Annie didn’t stop to think. They followed as fast as they could. Jack’s heavy pack thumped against his back as he ran.

Finally, they stopped and looked around.

“Where did she go?” he said.

“I don’t see her,” said Annie.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She pointed up.

There was the magic tree house. It was shining in the noon sun, at the top of the tallest tree in the woods. Its rope ladder swayed in the shadows below.

“Where’s Morgan?” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay wasn’t waving at them from the window. She wasn’t even at the window.

“I don’t know. Let’s go up,” said Jack.

They climbed the ladder and went into the tree house.

Sunlight streamed through the window. It lit a stack of books and two scrolls in the corner. The ancient scrolls held the answers to riddles Jack and Annie had solved earlier.

Jack took off his heavy pack.

“Did Morgan leave us a third riddle?” said Annie.

“Looking for someone?” said a soft voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around.

“Morgan!” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay had appeared out of nowhere. She looked ancient and lovely in the bright light.

“Do you still want to become Master Librarians?” she asked Jack and Annie. “So you can help me in my work?”

“Yes!” they said together.

“Wonderful,” Morgan said. Then she reached into her robe and pulled out a scroll.

“You’ve solved two riddles so far,” she said. “Here is your third.” She handed the scroll to Annie. “And for your research—”

She pulled a book out from her robe and handed it to Jack. The book’s cover said THE PLAINS OF AFRICA.



“Africa?” said Jack. “Oh, man, I’ve always wanted to go there.”

He opened the book. He and Annie stared at a picture.

It showed hordes of zebras, tall giraffes, big animals with horns, and tiny, deerlike creatures.

“Hey, that’s the animal that led us here!” said Annie.

“A Thomson’s gazelle, I believe,” Morgan said.

“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

“You’ll find out,” said Morgan.

Morgan smiled. “No. Go ahead. Make your wish now.”

Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

“Be careful,” said Morgan. “Just keep an eye out.”

“For what?” said Jack.

“The lions, of course,” she said.

“Wait!” said Jack.

Too late.

The wind had started to blow.

The tree house had started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Jump, Beasts! Jump!

Bright light flooded the tree house again. A rustling sound came from outside the window.

Annie peeked out and laughed. “Hey, there,” she said.

Jack looked out, too. A giraffe was eating leaves off the tree. It had a sweet, goofy face.

Jack peered at the world beyond the giraffe. He couldn’t believe his eyes.

He saw a huge grassy plain, a wide river, and tons of birds and animals—more than he had ever imagined in one place.

Giraffes and zebras were on the side of the river where Jack and Annie were. Thomson’s gazelles and the big horned animals were on the other side.



“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Do you think it’s always this crowded?”

“Let’s find out,” said Jack.

He picked up the book on Africa and looked at the picture of the animals. He read aloud:

Every year, in late spring, thousands of zebras and gazelles and millions of wildebeests (WILL-duh-beests) migrate from the dry plains of Tanzania to Kenya.



“What’s ‘migrate’ mean?” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “It means they go someplace else for part of the year—like birds going south for the winter.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

Jack turned the page to read more.

Before they are safe in Kenya, the animals must first cross the Mara River. Zebras go first, then the wildebeests. The tiny gazelles swim last.



“Ohh,” said Annie in a sad voice.

“What’s wrong?” said Jack.

“Poor beasts.” She looked out the window. “They seem afraid.”

On the far side of the river, the horned animals were standing at the edge of the steep bank of the river. They stared down nervously at the rushing water.

“Jump, beasts! Jump!” Annie shouted.

“Don’t be silly. They can’t hear you,” said Jack.

He studied the broad plain. “I wonder where the lions are,” he said.

“I don’t know. But I have to go,” said Annie.

“Go where?” said Jack.

“To the river to help them,” she said.

“Help who?” said Jack.

“Those wild beasts on the other side!” said Annie. “I have to help them migrate.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack.

Annie handed Jack the scroll and started out of the tree house.

“Wait a second!” said Jack. “We haven’t even read Morgan’s riddle yet!”

Annie stopped on the ladder.

“Read it now,” she said.

Jack unrolled the ancient scroll and read aloud:

I’m the color of gold and as sweet as can be. But beware of the danger that’s all around me. What am I?



Annie started down again.

“Annie!”

“We’ll look for the answer in a minute,” said Annie.

“What are you doing?” Jack called.

But there was no stopping her. Jack watched as she hopped off the ladder. Then she started to walk through the tall grass, between the zebras and giraffes.

“I don’t believe her,” he said to himself. He quickly put the Africa book into his pack.

He started down the ladder.

When he stepped onto the ground, he looked around carefully.

The giraffes were eating the tree leaves.

The zebras were grazing in the grass.

Tons of birds flapped overhead.

This is okay, he thought. He just had one little question:

Where are the lions?



3. Disaster

“Come on, Jack!” Annie called. She was almost to the river.

“Just a minute!” he shouted. He wanted to study the giraffes and zebras.

He pulled out the Africa book and found a picture of giraffes. He read:

The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. Its legs alone can be six feet tall, and its hooves can be as big as dinner plates. The giraffe has a very powerful kick, which makes it dangerous to attack. For this reason, lions tend to avoid giraffes.



Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



He turned the page and read more:

Zebras live in family groups. As no two zebras have exactly the same pattern of stripes, every baby zebra must learn its own mother’s pattern.



Jack studied the zebras, trying to see their different patterns. But in the hazy afternoon light, all the stripes made him dizzy.

He blinked to clear his head, then read more:

Zebras are the first to cross the river because they eat the coarsest grass. After they’ve thinned down the top layer, the wildebeests arrive and eat the next layer. They prepare the grass for the gazelles, who come last.



Wow, thought Jack. Each animal depends on the one that goes before.

He wrote:



Jack heard Annie shouting from the riverbank. “Jump, beasts! Jump! You can do it! Don’t be afraid! Come on!”

He looked up. Annie herself was jumping as she called to the wildebeests.

Jack sighed. I’d better stop her before there’s trouble, he thought.

He put away the Africa book and his notebook. Then he jogged toward the river. His pack was heavy and lumpy, bumping against his back. He’d forgotten to take out the jar of peanut butter and the loaf of bread.

Jack decided to leave them at the tree house. He turned to go back.

But just then, Annie’s shouting stopped.

Jack looked at the river.

She had vanished.

“Annie?” he called.

No answer.

Where was she?

“Annie!” Jack shouted.

She had completely disappeared.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

Their trip had barely begun, and already disaster had struck!

He forgot about the stuff in his pack. He just ran as fast as he could.

He wove his way between the grazing zebras and giraffes as he raced to the river.

“Help!” called Annie.



4. Mud Bath

Jack looked over the edge of the riverbank.

Annie had fallen into a pool of mud near the water. The thick black mud was up to her chest.

“I slipped,” she said. “It feels like quicksand.”

Jack threw down his pack and got on his knees.

“Be careful,” said Annie. “Don’t slip, too.”

Jack pointed to a tangle of old tree roots sticking out of the bank. “Grab those!” he said.

Annie reached for the roots. “Too far,” she said, breathing hard. “I’m sinking.”

She was sinking. The mud was up to her neck.

“Hold on!” Jack looked around wildly. He saw a fallen tree branch near the bank.

He raced to it, picked it up, and carried it back to Annie. Only her head and arms stuck out of the mud now.

Jack held out the branch. Annie grabbed it.

“Hold tight,” said Jack. “I’ll drag you over to the roots!”

He started pulling on the branch.

“I’m still sinking!” Annie wailed. The mud was up to her chin.

“Come on!” said Jack. “You can do it! I know you can! Try! Try!”

Just then, Jack heard a splash! He looked up.

On the other side of the wide river, a wildebeest had jumped into the water. Another jumped … then another. They were headed right toward Jack and Annie.

“Hold on tight!” said Jack. He pulled on the stick again.

Annie moved a tiny bit.

“Hey, Jack, on the moon it felt like I weighed ten pounds,” said Annie. “And in this mud it feels like I weigh a ton.”

“Concentrate, Annie,” said Jack, trying not to slip down the bank.

“I am.”

The lead wildebeests were halfway across, swimming toward them. Many more wildebeests were jumping into the water.

“It’s now or never!” said Jack. He took a deep breath. He pulled really hard.

Just then, a shadow passed over them. Jack looked up.

“Uh-oh,” he said.

A huge vulture circled overhead.

“It thinks you’re near the end,” said Jack.

“Oh, get out of here!” Annie shouted at the vulture. “I’m fine!”

In a burst of fury, she let go of the branch. She lunged for the roots. She grabbed them!

“Yes!” cried Jack. “Pull! Pull!”

Slowly, Annie pulled herself out. She was covered with the black mud from head to toe.

Jack helped her onto the bank, getting mud all over himself.



“See!” Annie shook her fist at the vulture. “I’m fine! Now beat it!”

But the giant, ugly bird still circled.

“Come on. Let’s get away from him,” said Jack. He pushed his glasses into place.

“Rats,” he said. Now his glasses were muddy.

He tried to clean his hands in the grass.

“Oh, no!” shouted Annie.

Jack turned to her.

“The wildebeests will get stuck in the mudhole!” she cried. She waved her arms at the wildebeests struggling to swim across the river.

“Not here,” she shouted. “Not here!”

But the frantic swimmers kept coming.



5. Ha-Ha

“Oh, no! No! No!” shouted Annie.

She raced down the bank, until she reached a sandy, clear spot.

“Here! Here!” she called.

The wildebeests followed her with their wild eyes.

Jack watched in disbelief as the swimmers changed their course. Slowly, all the wildebeests swam to where Annie stood. She waved them in like a traffic policeman.

Jack grabbed his backpack.

“Annie,” he cried, “let’s go before we get trampled!”

“Keep it up,” she shouted to the wildebeests as she took off after Jack.

They ran farther up the river, away from the incoming wildebeests. Finally, they stopped to catch their breath. They looked back.

Everything seemed fine. The wildebeests were scrambling safely over the riverbank. Soon they would graze on the grass prepared by the zebras.

“Good work,” Jack said to Annie.

“Thanks,” she said. “Okay, now for our riddle … ”

“No, first we’ve got to get clean,” said Jack. “You look like you’re in a mud suit.”

High-pitched laughter rang through the air. It sounded mocking and mean.

Jack and Annie turned around. They saw two spotted brown animals standing in the tall grass.

The creatures had bodies like dogs, but with sloping backs. They laughed again.

“Ha-ha,” said Annie. “You don’t look so great yourself.”

“What are they?” said Jack. He took out the book. He tried not to get mud on it as he looked for a picture. When he found it, he read aloud:

On the African plains, the hyena (hi-EE-nuh) is the ruling predator after the lion. It makes a sound similar to a high-pitched human laugh.



“What’s ‘predator’ mean?” said Annie.

“It means it catches things and eats them,” said Jack.

“Oh,” said Annie. “Yuck.”

The two hyenas laughed again. And they moved closer to Jack and Annie.

Quietly, Jack read more:

The hyena has a reputation for being a thief and a coward.



“Let’s see if they’re cowards,” whispered Annie. “Let’s try to scare them.”

The hyenas laughed and moved a little closer.

“How?” Jack asked.

“Act like a monster!” said Annie. “Now!”

Jack and Annie made terrible monster faces. They put out their hands and rushed at the hyenas.

“ARGGGGHH!” they shouted.

The hyenas yelped and scurried off.

“Scaredy-cats!” Annie shouted after them.

“Come on,” said Jack.



Annie and Jack took off in the other direction. They ran around a bend in the river.

Jack heard the hyena laughter again. It sounded far away.

“Good,” he said, “they’re gone.”

“Hey, maybe we can wash over there,” said Annie.

She pointed to the edge of the forest. There was a small pond surrounded by tall grass. Zebras were drinking the water.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “If it’s safe enough for them to drink … ”

The zebras ignored them as they walked toward the pond.

When they reached the edge of the water, Jack set his heavy pack down in the dry grass. He glanced around. No lions were in sight. But then he heard something.

On the far side of the pond, something very big was coming out of the trees.



6. Spick-and-Span

“Be still,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie stood frozen as an elephant stepped out of the shadows. It waded into the pond and dipped its trunk into the water.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie.

Jack breathed a sigh of relief. An elephant wasn’t going to chase them and eat them. Still, the elephant was huge.

“Let’s sneak away,” said Jack.

“But I want to watch,” said Annie.

“Fine,” said Jack. He was tired of Annie getting sidetracked. “I’m going to solve the riddle by myself. I’ll meet you back at the tree house.”

He turned to go. A spray of water rained down on him. It came from behind. He shouted with surprise and looked back.

The elephant’s trunk was pointed straight at Annie.

“Cool!” she cried. “He’s giving me a shower!”



The elephant sprayed her again … then again. The mud slowly rolled off her face, her braids, her T-shirt, her shorts, her legs, and her sneakers

“I guess the elephant doesn’t like dirty kids!” said Annie, laughing. Her eyes were squeezed shut.

Finally, she was clean and soaking wet.

“Now it’s your turn,” she said to Jack.

Jack stepped forward and shut his eyes tight. A blast of water hit him. It did feel like a shower—a strong shower.

When Jack was clean, the elephant let out a grunt. Then he started to splash himself with water.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

“Yeah, thanks!” said Jack.

“I’m spick-and-span now,” said Annie. “When the sun dries me off, I’ll be like new.”

“Good,” said Jack. “Now we can get serious.”

He picked up his heavy pack. “We have to figure out the answer to the riddle. So we can leave this place … before we run into real trouble.”

He looked around nervously. Where are the lions? he wondered.

A small bird flitted near his head.

“Hi,” Annie said to the bird.

Jack turned back to her. “According to the riddle, we’re looking for something gold and sweet.”

“What do you want?” Annie asked the bird.

The bird twittered and flew around Jack and Annie. Its feathers were dull gray. But it had a bright, happy manner.

“Annie, listen to me, not the bird,” said Jack.

The bird kept fluttering around them.

“She’s trying to tell us something,” said Annie.

Jack let out a long sigh. “You are driving me crazy today,” he said.

“But I feel like she needs our help,” said Annie. “Maybe her babies fell out of the nest.”

“Annie, you can’t save every animal in Africa,” said Jack.

“This bird is important,” said Annie. “Trust me.”

The bird darted toward the trees. It landed on a branch and cocked its head at them.

“She says follow,” said Annie.

The bird headed into the forest. Annie started after it.

“Don’t go in there!” said Jack. “You might run into—”

There was no need to finish. The bird and Annie had disappeared into the trees.

“—a snake or a lion,” Jack said to himself.

“Come on!” Annie called.

Jack moaned. He pulled on his pack and ran. The peanut butter jar thumped against his back.



7. Hi, There

The forest was cooler than the sunny plains. It was filled with shadows and bird calls.

“Where are you?” Jack shouted.

“Here!” said Annie.

He found her in a thick glade.

Bright rays streamed between the trees. Green leaves and vines swayed in the dappled light.

The little gray bird sat in a tree, twittering at them.

“Yuck, what’s that?” said Annie. She pointed at a round brown thing hanging from a low branch. Bees buzzed around it.

“If that’s her nest, it’s a pretty weird nest,” said Annie.

“That’s not a nest,” said Jack. “It’s a beehive. Don’t you see the bees?”

“Yikes,” said Annie. She stepped back from the tree.

But the little bird darted at the beehive and pecked at it.

“What’s she doing?” said Annie.

The bird kept pecking at the hive.

“I don’t know. Maybe she’s as nuts as you,” said Jack.

“Look her up in the book,” said Annie. “See if it says she’s nuts.”

“Are you kidding?” said Jack. “That nutty bird isn’t going to be in this book.”

“Just look.”

Jack opened his Africa book. He kept turning the pages. Just as he thought—there was no gray bird in the book.

“Forget it,” he said.

“Keep looking,” said Annie.

Jack turned one more page. And there it was: a little gray bird, a beehive, and a tall, painted warrior with a spear.

“I don’t believe this,” said Jack.

Then he read aloud:

This bird is called a honey guide. It’s both a friend and a helper to the Masai (muh-SI) people, an African tribe known for their fierce fighting skills and bravery.



“Hi, honey guide,” Annie called to the bird. “I knew you were important.”

Jack kept reading:

The honey guide leads a Masai tribesperson to a beehive. The bird waits for him or her to scatter the bees and take the honey. Then the bird feasts on the honeycomb.



“That’s cool,” said Jack. “They work together, like the zebras and wildebeests and gazelles.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “And she wants us to be her helpers. We have to scatter the bees and leave her the honeycomb.”

“How do we do that?” said Jack. He looked back at the book. It didn’t say how.

“Well, maybe we could wave those weeds at them,” said Annie. She pointed to some bright green plants that looked like giant fans.

Jack put his book and backpack down. He and Annie pulled up the weeds. They waved them near the tree, and the bees scattered.



Next, Jack grabbed the tree branch and jiggled it. The hive fell to the ground and broke open.

Annie stooped and stuck her finger into the golden honeycomb.

“Yummy,” she said when she tasted the honey. “Try it.”

Jack stuck his finger in the honeycomb, too. He licked off the golden honey. It was the sweetest honey he had ever tasted.

“Now the honey guide can get to her honeycomb,” said Annie.

“Yeah, but she’d better hurry. Before the bees come back,” said Jack.

“It’s weird,” said Annie. “Honey’s so sweet and good. But to get it, you have to go past a lot of dangerous bees.”

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “That’s it.”

“That’s what?” asked Annie.

Jack said Morgan’s riddle:

I’m the color of gold and as sweet as can be. But beware of the danger that’s all around me. What am I?



“I get it,” Annie whispered. “Honey … ”

“Honey,” said Jack, nodding and smiling. “That’s it. We’ve answered Morgan’s riddle. Let’s go home.”

He stood up to leave. He gasped.

Standing in the shadows was a tall man with a spear and a curved sword hanging from his belt. His face was painted in fierce, bright colors.

Jack knew at once what he was.

A Masai warrior.

“Hi, there,” Annie said in a small voice.



8. Yum

The warrior stared back at Jack and Annie.

“We were helping one of your honey guides,” said Annie.

The warrior was as still as a statue.

“We didn’t mean to steal anything,” Jack said. “In fact, it’s all yours. We’ve had enough.”

“Lots of good honey still there,” Annie said, smiling.

The warrior narrowed his eyes.

Is he angry? Jack wondered.

“I’m sorry we were trespassing,” said Jack. “We come in peace. In fact, we bring gifts.” He picked up his backpack and held it out to the warrior.

The warrior still didn’t move.

“This?” Jack held up his book.

Nothing.

“Uh—” Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the big jar of peanut butter.

“Peanut butter!” He pulled out the loaf of bread. “Bread! Hey. Hey! How about a peanut butter and honey sandwich?”

“Yum!” Annie said, watching the warrior.

The warrior stared at the food.

“We’ll show you,” said Jack.

As Jack unwrapped the bread, his hands shook.

Annie opened the jar.

“We don’t have anything to spread it with,” she said.

“Use your fingers,” said Jack.

“Excuse me,” Annie said to the warrior. “I have to use my fingers. But they’re pretty clean. An elephant just—”

“Just do it, Annie!” said Jack.

“Okay, okay.”

She spread the peanut butter onto a slice of bread with her fingers. At the same time, Jack spread the honey from the beehive on another slice.

Jack and Annie put their pieces of bread together.

“Ta-da!” said Annie, handing the sandwich to the warrior.

The warrior took the sandwich, but he didn’t eat it. He just looked at it.



“Let’s make sandwiches for us, too,” Jack said. “So he doesn’t have to eat alone.”

They quickly made two more sandwiches.

“See, like this,” said Annie. She bit into her sandwich. “Mmm … yum.”

Jack took a bite, too. “Mmm … ” he said. It was really good.

Finally, the warrior bit into his sandwich. He chewed slowly.

“This is called a picnic,” said Annie.

They ate their sandwiches in silence.

When they finished, Jack screwed the lid back on the peanut butter jar.

“Not bad, huh?” he said.

The warrior smiled. He had a kind, dignified smile.

Jack and Annie smiled back at him.

Then the warrior turned gracefully and vanished into the trees.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. Part of him wanted to follow the silent warrior through the shadowy forest.

“Ready?” Annie asked softly.

Jack nodded.

Annie started to go.

“Wait,” said Jack. He put away the peanut butter and bread. “We’re going back to the tree house, right? We’re not going to do anything silly, like rescue anything or chase birds. Right?”

“Those things aren’t silly,” said Annie. “Don’t forget that the bird gave us the answer to the riddle.”

“Oh. Right,” said Jack.

He looked at the little honey guide. She was on the ground, pecking at the honeycomb.

“Thanks,” Jack said to the bird.

“Have a good feast,” said Annie.

Jack put on his pack. Then he and Annie started out of the forest.

When they passed the pond, they saw the elephant still splashing in the water. He lifted his trunk. He seemed to be waving at them.

“See ya!” Annie shouted, waving back.

They rounded the bend in the river, then started through the tall grass.

As they walked back toward the tree house, they saw the wildebeests in the distance. There were still some crossing the river.

They saw a family of zebras grazing together.

They saw lone giraffes walking from tree to tree, eating the leaves.

And they saw a bunch of lions sleeping in the shade of a tree—the same tree that the tree house was in.

“Whoops,” said Annie.

Jack’s heart gave a jump.

“So there they are,” he said.



9. Tiptoe

Jack and Annie crouched in the tall grass. There was a big lion, three lionesses, and a bunch of cubs.

“I think they’re sleeping,” whispered Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But for how long?”

He pulled the Africa book from his pack and opened it. He found a picture of lions sleeping under a tree.

He read in a whispery voice:

After a pride of lions has eaten, they rest for a few hours. The other—



“What did they have for lunch?” Annie broke in.

“Don’t ask,” said Jack. He kept reading:

Sensing that the lions are not hunting at the moment, the other animals graze nearby.



“If they can graze, then we’re safe,” said Annie. She started to stand.

“Wait!” Jack pulled her down. “Not so fast.”

He peered around. The words in the book seemed true: the zebras and giraffes didn’t seem to be bothered by the lions at all.

“They might be safe. But I’m not sure about us,” said Jack. “We need a plan.”

“What if we wait till they leave?” said Annie.

“That could take hours,” said Jack. “Plus they might be hungry again by then.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

“So here’s the plan—we tiptoe,” said Jack.

“Tiptoe?”

“Yeah?”

“That’s your whole plan?” said Annie.

“Yeah, tiptoe to the rope ladder,” said Jack. “Very quietly.”

“Good plan,” Annie teased.

“Just do it,” said Jack. He stood up slowly. Annie stood with him.

They began tiptoeing through the grass very slowly.

The lion flicked his tail.

Jack and Annie froze.

When his tail was still again, they moved again.

Suddenly, high-pitched laughter split the air.

Jack and Annie stopped.

The hyenas were back! They were standing off to the side, watching Jack and Annie.

Jack and Annie made silent monster faces and shook their fists. But the hyenas only laughed some more.

The big lion stirred lazily. He opened his golden eyes.

Jack felt the hair rise on the back of his neck. But he didn’t move an inch.



The lion lifted his head and yawned. His giant teeth gleamed in the sunlight. The lion turned his head as he looked around sleepily.

Jack held his breath as the lion’s gaze rested on him. The lion sat straight up. His piercing yellow eyes met Jack’s.

Jack’s heart raced. His mind raced. He remembered something he’d read—lions avoid giraffes.

Jack looked around. There was a giraffe walking toward the tree that the magic tree house was in.

Suddenly, he had a new plan.

“Get under that giraffe,” he whispered.

“Now you’re the one who’s nuts,” Annie whispered back.

But Jack grabbed her hand. He pulled her over to the giraffe and underneath it.

The giraffe’s legs were so long, Jack and Annie could stand up under it. Jack’s head barely brushed the giraffe’s golden belly.

The tall creature froze for a few seconds. Then she moved slowly toward the tree.

Jack and Annie walked in the same rhythm as the giraffe.

They got closer and closer to the tree house—and closer and closer to the pride of lions.

The big lion had stood up. He watched them moving under the giraffe.

When the rope ladder was just a few feet away, Jack and Annie dashed out from under the giraffe to the rope ladder.

Annie scrambled up first.

Jack followed right behind her.

As they climbed, the lion growled and leaped at the ladder.

The hyenas laughed.

Jack climbed faster than he’d ever climbed. He leaped after Annie into the tree house.



Annie had already unrolled the scroll. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:

HONEY

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He opened it and found the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“Iwishwecouldgothere!” he said.

Just then, the giraffe stuck her head through the window.

“Bye, honey!” said Annie, and she kissed the giraffe on the nose.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. After Lunch

Jack opened his eyes. His heart was still racing. Hyena laughter still rang in his ears.

“We made it,” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Jack. “But it was very close.”

Jack took another moment to calm down. Then he pulled the Africa book out of his pack and put it with the other books.

Annie put the scroll with the other two scrolls.

“The giraffe was the true honey on that trip,” she said, “sweet and golden, with danger all around it.”

“Yep,” Jack said. “And now we have just one riddle to go.”

“Yep,” said Annie. “Ready?”

“Ready.”

She started down the ladder. Jack followed. When they hit the ground, they walked through the sunlit woods.

“It’s time for lunch,” said Jack.

“I’m full from our picnic,” said Annie.

“Same here,” said Jack.

“What do we tell Mom?” said Annie.

“We say we ate our sandwiches coming back from the store,” said Jack.

“What if she asks why?” said Annie.

“Oh … just say we had a picnic with a Masai warrior in Africa,” said Jack.

Annie laughed. “Right,” she said, “because we didn’t want him to be mad at us for taking his honey.”

“Right,” said Jack, “the honey from a beehive that a honey guide led us to.”

“Right,” said Annie, “and that happened after an elephant gave me a shower. And we scared off two hyenas.”

“Right,” said Jack, “and after you fell into a mudhole because you were helping a million wildebeests migrate across a river.”

“Right,” said Annie. “And all that was before a giraffe saved us from a lion.”

“Right,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods and started up their sunny street.

They were silent for a moment.

Then Jack pushed his glasses into place. “We better just say we ate our sandwiches on the way home from the store,” he said.

“Right,” said Annie.

“And if Mom asks why—” started Jack.

“We’ll just say it’s a really long story,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack, “with, like—ten chapters.”

Annie laughed. “Good plan,” she said.

“Very good plan,” said Jack.

They crossed their yard. They went up their steps and through their front door.

“We’re back!” Annie shouted.

“Great!” called their mom. “Ready for lunch?”

Whoo. The strange sound came from outside the open window.

Jack opened his eyes in the dark.

The sound came again. Whoo

Jack sat up and turned on his light. He put on his glasses. Then he grabbed the flashlight from his table and shone it out the window.

A white snowy owl was sitting on a tree branch.

“Whoo,” the owl said again. Its large yellow eyes looked right into Jack’s.

What does he want? Jack wondered. Is he a sign, like the rabbit and the gazelle?

A long-legged rabbit and a gazelle had led Jack and Annie to the magic tree house for their last two adventures.

“Whoo.”

“Wait a second,” Jack said to the owl. “I’ll get Annie.”

Jack’s sister, Annie, always seemed to know what birds and animals were saying.

Jack jumped out of bed and hurried to Annie’s room. She was sound asleep.

Jack shook her and she stirred.

“What?” she said.

“Come to my room,” whispered Jack. “I think Morgan’s sent another sign.”

In a split second, Annie was out of bed. She hurried with Jack to his room.

Jack led her to the window. The snowy owl was still there.

“Whoo,” said the owl. Then he raised his white wings and took off into the night.

“He wants us to go to the woods,” said Annie.

“That’s what I thought,” said Jack. “Meet you downstairs after we get dressed.”

“No, no. He says go now. Right now,” said Annie. “We’ll have to wear our pajamas.”

“I have to put on my sneakers,” said Jack.

“Okay, I’ll put on mine, too. Meet you downstairs,” said Annie.

Jack pulled on his sneakers. He threw his notebook into his backpack. Then he grabbed his flashlight and tiptoed downstairs.

Annie was waiting at the front door. They silently slipped outside together.

The night air was warm. Moths danced around the porch light.

“I feel weird,” said Jack. “I’m going back to put on some real clothes.”

“You can’t,” said Annie. “The owl said right now.”

She jumped off the porch and headed across their dark yard.

Jack groaned. How did Annie know exactly what the owl said? he wondered.

Still, he didn’t want to be left behind. So he took off after her.

The moon lit their way as they ran down their street. When they entered the Frog Creek woods, Jack turned on his flashlight.

The beam of light showed shadows and swaying branches.

Jack and Annie stepped between the trees. They stayed close together.

“Whoo.”

Jack jumped in fear.

“It’s just the white owl,” said Annie. “He’s somewhere nearby.”

“The woods are creepy,” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie. “In the dark, it doesn’t even feel like our woods.”

Suddenly the owl flapped near them.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

Jack shone his flashlight on the white bird as it rose into the sky. The owl landed on a tree branch—right next to the magic tree house.

And there was Morgan le Fay, the enchantress librarian. Her long white hair gleamed in the beam of Jack’s flashlight.



“Hello,” Morgan called softly in a soothing voice. “Climb up.”

Jack used his flashlight to find the rope ladder. Then he and Annie climbed up into the tree house.

Morgan was holding three scrolls. Each one held the answer to an ancient riddle that Jack and Annie had already solved.

“You have journeyed to the ocean, the Wild West, and Africa to find the answers to these three riddles,” said Morgan. “Ready for another journey?”

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

Morgan pulled a fourth scroll from the folds of her robe. She handed it to Annie.

“After we solve this riddle, will we become Master Librarians?” asked Annie.

“And help you gather books through time and space?” said Jack.

“Almost … ” said Morgan.

Before Jack could ask what she meant, Morgan pulled out a book and gave it to him. “For your research,” she said.

Jack and Annie looked at the book’s title: ADVENTURE IN THE ARCTIC.

“Oh, wow, the Arctic!” said Annie.

“The Arctic?” said Jack. He turned to Morgan. “Are you serious?”

“Indeed I am,” she said. “And you must hurry.”

“I wish we could go there,” said Annie, pointing at the cover.

“Wait—wait a minute—we’ll freeze to death!” said Jack.

“Fear not,” said Morgan. “I am sending someone to meet you.”

The wind started to blow.

“Meet us? Who?” said Jack.

“Whoo?” said the snowy owl.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books … I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year … WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home … I have since introduced this great series to my class.

My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





Dear Readers,

A while ago, I began researching the Arctic because so many of you wanted Jack and Annie to go there. When I came across a certain astonishing fact, I got very excited about writing the story. The fact was this: Even though polar bears can weigh as much as 1,000 pounds, they can walk on ice that is too thin to hold a person! How do they do this? They lie flat on the ice and perfectly balance their weight so that the ice won’t crack. Then they move forward by pulling with their claws, all the while maintaining their perfect balance.

As you’ll see, this particular fact, combined with my imagination, helped me plot the story.

So if you were to ask me where I get the inspiration for my Magic Tree House books, I’d have to say: readers, research, and my imagination. And I get further inspiration from my editor, Mallory Loehr, who has worked on all the books with me. She and I have fun meetings in which we go over and over the ideas for each book.

I hope you enjoy reading Polar Bears Past Bedtime as much as I enjoyed researching and writing it. And I hope it will inspire you to try researching and writing your own book.

All best,

1. Are You Serious?

Whoo. The strange sound came from outside the open window.

Jack opened his eyes in the dark.

The sound came again. Whoo.

Jack sat up and turned on his light. He put on his glasses. Then he grabbed the flashlight from his table and shone it out the window.

A white snowy owl was sitting on a tree branch.

“Whoo,” the owl said again. Its large yellow eyes looked right into Jack’s.

What does he want? Jack wondered. Is he a sign, like the rabbit and the gazelle?

A long-legged rabbit and a gazelle had led Jack and Annie to the magic tree house for their last two adventures.

“Whoo.”

“Wait a second,” Jack said to the owl. “I’ll get Annie.”

Jack’s sister, Annie, always seemed to know what birds and animals were saying.

Jack jumped out of bed and hurried to Annie’s room. She was sound asleep.

Jack shook her and she stirred.

“What?” she said.

“Come to my room,” whispered Jack. “I think Morgan’s sent another sign.”

In a split second, Annie was out of bed. She hurried with Jack to his room.

Jack led her to the window. The snowy owl was still there.

“Whoo,” said the owl. Then he raised his white wings and took off into the night.

“He wants us to go to the woods,” said Annie.

“That’s what I thought,” said Jack. “Meet you downstairs after we get dressed.”

“No, no. He says go now. Right now,” said Annie. “We’ll have to wear our pajamas.”

“I have to put on my sneakers,” said Jack.

“Okay, I’ll put on mine, too. Meet you downstairs,” said Annie.

Jack pulled on his sneakers. He threw his notebook into his backpack. Then he grabbed his flashlight and tiptoed downstairs.

Annie was waiting at the front door. They silently slipped outside together.

The night air was warm. Moths danced around the porch light.

“I feel weird,” said Jack. “I’m going back to put on some real clothes.”

“You can’t,” said Annie. “The owl said right now.”

She jumped off the porch and headed across their dark yard.

Jack groaned. How did Annie know exactly what the owl said? he wondered.

Still, he didn’t want to be left behind. So he took off after her.

The moon lit their way as they ran down their street. When they entered the Frog Creek woods, Jack turned on his flashlight.

The beam of light showed shadows and swaying branches.

Jack and Annie stepped between the trees. They stayed close together.

“Whoo.”

Jack jumped in fear.

“It’s just the white owl,” said Annie. “He’s somewhere nearby.”

“The woods are creepy,” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie. “In the dark, it doesn’t even feel like our woods.”

Suddenly the owl flapped near them.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

Jack shone his flashlight on the white bird as it rose into the sky. The owl landed on a tree branch—right next to the magic tree house.

And there was Morgan le Fay, the enchantress librarian. Her long white hair gleamed in the beam of Jack’s flashlight.



“Hello,” Morgan called softly in a soothing voice. “Climb up.”

Jack used his flashlight to find the rope ladder. Then he and Annie climbed up into the tree house.

Morgan was holding three scrolls. Each one held the answer to an ancient riddle that Jack and Annie had already solved.

“You have journeyed to the ocean, the Wild West, and Africa to find the answers to these three riddles,” said Morgan. “Ready for another journey?”

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

Morgan pulled a fourth scroll from the folds of her robe. She handed it to Annie.

“After we solve this riddle, will we become Master Librarians?” asked Annie.

“And help you gather books through time and space?” said Jack.

“Almost … ” said Morgan.

Before Jack could ask what she meant, Morgan pulled out a book and gave it to him. “For your research,” she said.

Jack and Annie looked at the book’s title: ADVENTURE IN THE ARCTIC.

“Oh, wow, the Arctic!” said Annie.

“The Arctic?” said Jack. He turned to Morgan. “Are you serious?”

“Indeed I am,” she said. “And you must hurry.”

“I wish we could go there,” said Annie, pointing at the cover.

“Wait—wait a minute—we’ll freeze to death!” said Jack.

“Fear not,” said Morgan. “I am sending someone to meet you.”

The wind started to blow.

“Meet us? Who?” said Jack.

“Whoo?” said the snowy owl.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. The Howling

The air was crisp and cold.

Jack and Annie shivered. They looked out the window at a dark gray sky.

The tree house was on the ground. There were no trees and no houses—only an endless field of ice and snow. Morgan and the owl were gone.

“R-r-read the riddle,” said Annie, her teeth chattering.



Jack unrolled the scroll. He read:

I cover what’s real

and hide what’s true.

But sometimes I bring out

the courage in you.

What am I?



“I’d better write it down,” said Jack, shivering.

He pulled out his notebook and copied the riddle. Then he opened the book. He found a picture of a barren white field. He read aloud:

The Arctic tundra is a treeless plain. During the dark winter, it is covered with snow and ice. In early spring, snow falls, but the sky begins to get lighter. During the summer season, the snow and ice melt and the sun shines 24 hours a day.



“It must be early spring now,” said Jack. “There’s snow, but the sky is a little light.”

He turned the page. There was a picture of a man wearing a hooded coat with fur trim.

“Look at this guy,” said Jack. He showed Annie the picture.

“We need his coat,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Listen to this … ”

He read aloud:

This seal hunter wears sealskin

clothing to protect him from icy winds.

Before modern times, native people

of the Arctic lived by hunting seals,

caribou, polar bears, and whales.



Jack took out his notebook. He wrote:



He was too cold to write any more.

He clutched his pack against his chest and blew on his fingers. He wished he were back home in bed.

“Morgan said someone was coming to meet us,” said Annie.

“If they don’t come soon, we’ll freeze to death,” said Jack. “It’s getting darker and colder.”

“Shh. Listen,” said Annie.

A howling sound came from the distance … then more howling sounds … and more.

“What’s that?” said Jack.

They looked out the window. Snow was falling now. It was hard to see.

The howling grew louder. It was mixed with yipping and yelping noises. Jack and Annie saw dark shapes coming through the snow. They seemed to be running toward the tree house.

“Wolves?” said Annie.

“Great. That’s all we need,” said Jack. “We’re freezing, and now a pack of wolves is coming for us.”

Jack pulled Annie into the corner of the tree house. They huddled close together.

The howling got louder and louder. It sounded as if the wolves were circling the tree house. They whined and yelped.

Jack couldn’t stand it any longer. He grabbed the Arctic book.

“Maybe this can help us,” he said.

He searched for a picture of wolves.

“Oh—hi!” Annie said.

Jack looked up. He caught his breath.

A man was looking through the tree house window. His face was surrounded by fur.

It was the seal hunter from the Arctic book.



3. Mush!

“Did you come with the wolves?” asked Annie.

The seal hunter looked puzzled.

“Did Morgan send you to us?” said Jack.

“I had a dream,” the man said. “You were in it. You needed help.”

Annie smiled.

“Morgan sends dreams sometimes,” she said. “We came in Morgan’s tree house. It flies through time.”

Oh, brother, thought Jack. Who will believe that?

The seal hunter smiled as if he was not surprised at all.

“We do need help,” said Jack. “W-w-we’re fr-fr-freezing.”



The seal hunter nodded. Then he left the window. He returned a moment later with two small parkas like his own. They were made of heavy dark skins with fur-trimmed hoods.

He passed one to Jack and one to Annie.

“Thanks!” said Jack and Annie.

They put the parkas on.

“Hooray!” said Annie. “It’s warm!”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “They’re made of sealskin.”

“Poor seals,” said Annie.

“Don’t think about it,” said Jack. He pulled his hood up. His head and upper body were very snug now. Only his legs, hands, and feet were still freezing.

“Oh, thanks!” said Annie.

Jack looked up. The seal hunter was giving Annie a pair of fur pants. Then he handed a pair to Jack.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He quickly pulled the pants on over his pajamas.

Next the seal hunter gave each of them a pair of fur boots and mittens.

Jack took off his sneakers and pulled on the boots. He wiggled his frozen fingers into the warm mittens.

“I have a quick question,” Jack said to the seal hunter. “Do you know the answer to this riddle?”

He opened his notebook and read:

I cover what’s real

and hide what’s true.

But sometimes I bring out

the courage in you.

What am I?



The seal hunter shook his head.

“Come,” he said to Jack and Annie. Then he disappeared from the window.

“What about those wolves out there?” Jack called.

But the seal hunter didn’t answer.

Jack grabbed the Arctic book and looked for a picture of the seal hunter.

When Jack found the picture, he smiled. The seal hunter was standing beside a dogsled.

Jack read:

In cold weather, the seal hunter travels by dogsled. Siberian Huskies often howl like wolves. A lead dog controls the others. The sled’s runners are sometimes made of frozen fish rolled up in sealskin.



“Hey, Annie, they’re not wolves,” said Jack. “They’re—” He looked up.

Annie was gone.

Jack threw the book and notebook into his pack. But he was so fat in his furry clothes that the backpack wouldn’t fit. Jack loosened the shoulder straps and tried to put the backpack on again. It fit.

Jack looked at the small window. That would be a tight fit, too. He went out headfirst and barely squeezed through.

Jack fell onto the snowy ground. The snow was still drifting down. The air was misty white.

Jack heard barking and howling. He moved carefully toward the noise.

At first, he couldn’t see the dogsled. But when he got closer, he counted nine Siberian Huskies. They had thick fur, big heads, and pointy ears.

The lead dog barked at him.

Jack stopped.

“He’s telling you to climb on!” said Annie.

She was standing on the back of the sled. The seal hunter stood next to her in the snow.

Jack jumped onto the sled next to Annie.

The seal hunter cracked a long whip. “Mush!” he shouted.

The huskies dashed off in a whirl of snow.

Above them flew the snowy owl.



4. Snow House

The dogsled skimmed silently over the frozen tundra. The seal hunter ran alongside it. Sometimes he cracked his whip against the ice.

The snowdrifts looked like giant white sculptures as the sun slipped behind the frozen hills. Then a full orange moon rose in the sky.

The moonlight lit a small, rounded igloo in front of them. The dogs slowed, then stopped.



Jack stepped off the sled. Annie went to help unhitch the dogs. Jack took his book out and read about igloos:

The word “igloo” means “house” in the language of native Arctic people. The house is built with blocks of snow. Dry snow is good wall material because it keeps in the heat. The temperature inside an igloo can be 65 degrees warmer than the temperature outside.



Jack took out his notebook. He pulled off his mitten just long enough to write:



“Come on, Jack!” said Annie.

She and the seal hunter were waiting for him in front of the igloo. The dogs were leashed together outside.

Jack hurried to join them. The hunter pushed aside animal skins covering the entrance. They stepped inside.

A fat candle burned brightly. Shadows danced on walls of ice and snow.

Jack and Annie sat on a fur-covered platform. They watched as the seal hunter moved about.

First he lit a small stove. Then he slipped outside. He came back with a snowball and chunks of frozen meat.

He put the snowball in a pot over the stove. Then he added the meat.

“What’s he making?” asked Annie.

Jack pulled out his book and found a picture of the hunter cooking. He and Annie read the words silently:

There was a time when nearly all of the Arctic people’s food and clothing and tools came from Arctic animals, especially the seal. Nearly every part of the seal could be eaten. Lamps were fueled with seal fat. Clothing was made from sealskin. And knives and needles were carved from seal bones.



“He must be boiling seal meat,” said Jack.

“The poor seals,” said Annie.

The seal hunter looked up.

“They are not poor,” he said. “They help us because they know we would die without them.”

“Oh,” said Annie.

“In return, we always thank the animal spirits,” said the seal hunter.

“How do you do that?” said Jack.

“We have many special ceremonies,” said the seal hunter.

He reached under the fur-covered platform and took out two wooden masks.



“Soon there will be a ceremony to honor the spirit of the polar bear,” he said. “I carved these masks for the ceremony.”

“Polar bears?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said the hunter. “Just as the seal has given us many gifts, so has the polar bear.”

“Like what?” said Jack.

“Long ago the polar bear taught us how to live in the ice and snow,” said the seal hunter.

“Taught you?” said Jack. “I mean, can you give us some facts?”

The seal hunter smiled.

“Yes,” he said. “A polar bear catches a seal when the seal comes up to breathe through a hole in the ice. The oldest seal hunters watched the polar bear and learned. This is how my father taught me to hunt seal, as his father taught him.”

“That’s a good fact,” said Jack.

“The very first of my people learned to make igloos from polar bears,” said the hunter. “Polar bears build snow houses by digging caves in the drifts.”

“Another good fact,” said Jack.

“Sometimes the polar bear can even teach people to fly,” said the seal hunter.

“That’s an amazing fact,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. “The rest sounded like true facts,” he said. “But I know that’s pretend.”

The hunter just laughed, then turned back to his cooking.

That’s why he wasn’t surprised to hear about the tree house, Jack thought. If he believes polar bears can fly, he probably would believe anything.

The seal hunter lifted the chunks of boiled seal out of his pot. He dropped them into a wooden bucket and gave it to Annie.

“Let’s feed the dogs,” he said.

“Oh, boy!” said Annie. She followed the hunter outside, swinging the bucket.

Jack quickly threw his notebook and the Arctic book into his pack. He started to follow them. Then his gaze fell on the two bear masks.

He picked them up to get a better look.

Each was carved in the shape of a polar bear’s face with a blunt nose and roundish ears. There were two holes for eyes and a strap to hold it on your head.

Suddenly howls split the air. The dogs were barking and growling. Annie squealed.

Are the dogs attacking her? Jack wondered.

“Annie!”

Still holding the bear masks, Jack charged out of the igloo.



5. You’re It!

The dogs were barking wildly at two small creatures playing in the moonlight.

“Polar bear babies!” cried Annie.

One roly-poly cub leaped onto the other. Then they both rolled through the snow.

“Hi, little bears!” Annie called.

The cubs jumped up and shook themselves like wet puppies. Then they scampered toward Annie, who rushed to greet them.

“Hi, hi, hi!” she called.

“Wait—” shouted Jack. “Where’s their mother?”

He looked around for the mother bear, but she was nowhere in sight. Maybe they’re orphans, he thought.

Jack looked back at Annie. She was wrestling with the little bears in the snow. She was laughing so hard that she couldn’t stand.

Jack started laughing, too. He carefully put the bear masks into his pack. Then he ran to join Annie.

She was running with the cubs across the snowy tundra. One of them raced to her, tagged her, then raced away. Annie ran after the bear and tagged him back.

“You’re it!” she said.

Jack and the other cub joined in. Soon Jack and Annie and the two cubs were all chasing each other over the moonlit snow.

They ran until the two cubs fell down ahead of them. The cubs lay perfectly still.

Panting, Jack and Annie stared at them.

“Are they hurt?” Annie wondered out loud.

Jack and Annie ran to the cubs.

Then, just as they leaned down to see if they were all right, the cubs jumped up. They pushed Jack and Annie over and scampered away.

“They were pretending!” said Jack. He laughed.

Jack and Annie charged after the cubs. They ran over the white tundra until they came to the frozen sea.

Jack looked around.

“We’re pretty far from the igloo. I don’t hear the huskies anymore,” he said. “Maybe we should go back.”

“In a minute,” said Annie. “Look!”

The bear cubs had scooted up a snowbank. They were on their backs, sliding down the bank onto the ice-covered sea.

Jack and Annie laughed.

“It’s like sledding!” said Annie. “Let’s try it!”

“Okay,” said Jack, “but then we have to go back.”

Jack followed Annie up the snowbank. He clutched his pack in his arms.

Annie lay on her back. She whooped as she slid down the ice.

Jack followed her.

“Watch out below!” he shouted.



The little bears were sitting at the bottom of the snowbank. One gently whapped Jack in the face with her furry paw. Then she lay down.

“I’m tired, too,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Let’s rest for just a minute.”

Jack and Annie looked up at the orange moon as they lay beside the cubs. All they could hear was the wind and the soft breathing of the cubs.

“That was fun,” said Annie.

“It was,” said Jack. “But we’d better head back to the igloo. The seal hunter’s probably looking for us. Plus we have to solve the riddle.”

Jack rolled onto his side and tried to stand.

Crack.

“Uh-oh,” he said. He went back down onto his knees. “I think we’re on thin ice.”

“What do you mean?” said Annie. She started to stand.

Another crack rang out.

“Uh-oh,” she said.

She carefully lay back down.

The polar bear cubs moved closer to Jack and Annie. They made little crying sounds.

Jack wanted to cry, too. But he took a deep breath.

“Let’s see what our book says,” he said.

He reached into his pack for the Arctic book. He took the masks out first and handed them to Annie.

“I took these from the igloo by mistake,” he said.

As he started to reach for his Arctic book, he heard the loudest crack of all.

CRACK!

“We’re not even moving and the ice is cracking,” said Annie.

Just then, there was a new sound—a low, snorting sound. It came from the top of the snowbank, about fifty feet away.

Jack looked up.

Staring down at them was a giant polar bear.

“The polar bear mother,” whispered Annie.



6. Flying Bears

The cubs whimpered louder.

“They want to go to her, but they’re afraid of the ice,” whispered Jack.

Annie petted the cubs.

“Don’t be afraid,” she told them. “You’ll get back to your mother.”

The big polar bear growled. She paced back and forth, sniffing the air.

Annie kept patting the two cubs and whispering to them.

Jack looked in the book for anything that might help. Finally he found something:

Even though a female polar bear can weigh as much as 750 pounds, she can walk on ice too thin to hold a person by balancing her weight and sliding her paws over the ice.



“Oh, man, that’s incredible,” whispered Jack.

He watched the mother polar bear walk down the snowbank.

On large silent feet, she crept about at the edge of the frozen sea.

She tried to step onto the ice. But each time she did, it cracked, and she had to retreat. At last, she found a firm spot.

Then the polar bear stretched out her four legs and lay on the ice. Slowly she moved forward, pushing herself with her claws.

“Is she coming for her babies?” said Jack. “Or is she coming to get us?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Hey, let’s put on the masks.”

“What for?” said Jack.

“Maybe they’ll protect us,” said Annie. “Maybe she’ll think we’re polar bears, too.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But Annie gave him a bear mask. He took off his glasses and slipped it on.

Jack peered through the mask holes. It was hard to see the huge white bear sliding over the frozen sea. He squinted. That helped.

The polar bear looked at her cubs and let out a deep moan.

The two little bears carefully went to their mother. She licked the cubs and touched her nose against each of theirs. Then they crawled onto her back.

“They’re safe now,” said Jack. “Even if the mother breaks through the ice, she can swim with them to the shore.”

“Yeah, I just wish she wouldn’t leave us behind,” said Annie.

The mother bear slowly turned her body around. Then she pushed off with her hind legs. With her cubs on her back, she began sliding away.



“Let’s try moving like her,” Annie said.

“But we could break through and freeze to death,” said Jack.

“If we just stay here, we’ll freeze, too,” said Annie. “Remember, the seal hunter said his people had learned from the polar bears.”

Jack took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he said. “Let’s try it.”

He lay on his stomach. He spread out his arms and legs.

Then he copied the bear. He pressed his mittens against the ice and pushed off, sliding his feet.

Amazingly, there was no cracking sound.

“Grrr,” he growled. And he pushed off again.

Jack heard Annie sliding behind him. He kept going. He pushed and slid. He pushed again and slid again.

He made the movements over and over, until something happened: He didn’t feel like a boy anymore. He felt like a polar bear.

Then Jack felt something even stranger. He felt like a flying polar bear.

Jack swirled along as if his arms and legs were giant wings—and the moonlit sea ice were a glassy sky.

He remembered what the seal hunter had said: Polar bears can fly.



7. Spirit Lights

“Jack, you can get up now,” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. Annie was standing over him. She still had her mask on.

“We’re on safe ground,” she said.

Jack felt as if he’d been dreaming. He looked around. They had reached the tundra at the edge of the frozen sea.

The cubs were romping in the distance. But their mother was sitting nearby, gazing at Jack and Annie.

“She waited to make sure we were safe,” said Annie.

Jack stared at the polar bear in awe. The words of the seal hunter came back to him: Always thank the animal spirits.

“We should thank the polar bear spirit now,” he said.

“Of course,” said Annie.

Jack scrambled to his feet. Still wearing his bear mask, he stood before the polar bear and pressed his hands together.

“We thank you,” he said, bowing.

“Yes, we thank you forever,” said Annie, also bowing.

“We thank you beyond the moon and the stars,” said Jack.

“And beyond the deepest sea,” Annie added.

Then she threw out her arms and twirled around. Jack did the same. They both danced around in the snow, honoring the bear. Finally they stopped and bowed one last time.

When they looked up, the polar bear rose up on her hind legs. She was twice as tall as Jack. She lowered her huge head, as if she were bowing back to them.

At that moment, the sky exploded. The night became a giant swirl of red, green, and purple lights. It looked like a genie coming out of a magic lamp.

The sight took Jack’s breath away. He stared in wonder as the dazzling lights lit the tundra.

“Is it the polar bear spirit?” Annie asked in a hushed voice.

As far as Jack could see, the sky and snow shimmered. Even the bear’s fur shimmered in the strange light.

“No, it’s not a spirit,” said Jack. “There’s got to be a scientific reason. I’ll find out.”

Shaking, he reached into his backpack and pulled out the Arctic book. He took off his bear mask and put on his glasses.

By the greenish glow, Jack found a picture of the sky lights. The picture didn’t come close to the real thing. He read aloud:

One of the most amazing sights in the Arctic is the northern lights. The swirl of light is caused by electrically charged particles from the sun striking atoms and molecules in the earth’s atmosphere.



“See, there is a scientific reason!” said Jack. “It’s not the spirits.”



Then suddenly all the dancing lights were gone, as if someone had blown out a candle.

The magic had ended.



8. Riddle Solved

Now only the moon shone on the snow.

Jack looked around for the polar bear.

She was gone.

“Where’d she go?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He looked over the tundra. There was no sign of the giant bear or her cubs.

“Maybe she’s not interested in scientific reasons,” Jack said.

Annie sighed. She took off her bear mask and handed it to Jack. He put both their masks in his pack.

“Now what?” asked Annie.

They looked around. The vast fields of snow ended in darkness. Jack had no idea where they were.

He shrugged. “I guess we just have to walk and hope for the best.”

“Wait—listen,” said Annie.

From the distance came howling sounds. They grew louder and louder.

“Yay! We don’t have to wait long!” said Annie. “The huskies are coming!”

Howling filled the night as the dogsled came into view.

The seal hunter was running beside it.

“We’re here! Over here!” called Jack. He ran toward the sled. Annie followed.

“I was afraid you were lost,” said the seal hunter.

“We were!” said Annie. “And we got stuck on thin ice, too! But a polar bear helped us.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “And we wore your masks and they made us feel like bears—”

“Yeah, the masks made us brave,” said Annie. She caught her breath.

“Oh, man, wait—” said Jack. Annie’s words sounded familiar.

He took out his notebook and read Morgan’s riddle aloud:

I cover what’s real

and hide what’s true.

But sometimes I bring out

the courage in you.

What am I?



“A mask!” Jack and Annie said together.

The seal hunter smiled.

“You knew!” said Annie.

“It was for you to discover,” said the seal hunter. “Not me.”

Jack pulled the bear masks out of his backpack.

“Here,” he said. “Thanks a lot.”

The hunter took the masks and put them inside his parka.

“We can go home now,” said Jack.

“Do you mind taking us back to the tree house?” said Annie.

The seal hunter shook his head.

“Climb on,” he said.

Jack and Annie climbed onto the dogsled.

“Mush!” said the seal hunter.

“Mush!” said Annie.

“Mush!” said Jack.

Snow began to fall as they took off across the dark ice.



9. Oh, No, One More!

By the time the dogsled arrived at the tree house, the snowstorm had become a blizzard.

“Can you wait just a minute?” Jack asked the seal hunter. “So we can check something?”

The hunter nodded. His dogs whined as Jack and Annie climbed through the tree house window.

Jack grabbed the scroll that held the riddle. He unrolled it. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:



“We did it!” said Annie. “The tree house will take us home now.”

“Great!” said Jack. “Let’s say good-bye to the seal hunter and give him back his clothes.”

They quickly pulled off their sealskin clothing and their boots.

“Thanks for letting us borrow these!” Jack called through the window.



The seal hunter walked to the tree house and took the clothes from Jack and Annie. They stood shivering in their pajamas and bare feet.

“Th-th-thanks for everything!” said Annie, her teeth chattering.

The seal hunter gave them a wave. Then he walked through the swirling snow to his sled.

“Mush!” he shouted.

The dogs took off through the stormy night.

“Let’s get out of here!” said Jack. He hugged himself. “Before we freeze to death!”

Annie grabbed the Pennsylvania book that always took them home. She pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there!” she said.

They waited for the tree house to start spinning.

Nothing happened.

Jack shivered.

“I wish we could go there!” Annie said again.

Again nothing happened.

“Wh-wh-what’s going on?” said Jack.

He looked around the tree house. The four scrolls with the solved riddle answers were in the corner.

Then he saw it—a fifth scroll.

“Where did th-th-that come from?” he said.

Jack grabbed it and unrolled it. On it were the words:

Look at the letters:

the first, not the rest.

Discover the place

that you love the best.



“Oh, no!” said Annie. “Another riddle!”

“Okay, okay. Let’s stay c-c-calm,” Jack said, shivering. “Look at the letters: the first, not the rest. Okay, the first letters in this riddle are L-A-T-L-T—”

“That doesn’t make any sense,” Annie broke in.

Icy winds battered the tree house. Snow blew inside.

“We have to hurry!” said Annie.

Jack was freezing. He looked around wildly.

“Letters, letters, letters. What letters?” he said.

His gaze rested on the scrolls in the corner.

“M-m-maybe we should look at the letters of the answers,” he said.

“Right,” said Annie.

They began unrolling the scrolls.



The scroll from their adventure under the ocean said:



The scroll from their trip to the Wild West said:



The scroll from their journey to Africa said:



Their scroll from the Arctic said:



“Oyster, echo, honey, mask,” said Jack. “Their first letters are O-E-H-M.”

“That doesn’t make any sense, either,” said Annie.

“Yeah, but maybe we have to unscramble those letters,” said Jack. “O-E-H-M … They could spell hemo.”

“Or meho,” said Annie.

“Or home!” said Jack.

“HOME!” cried Annie. “That’s the place we love the best!”

Jack unrolled the fifth scroll again. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:



“Yay!” cried Annie. She grabbed the Pennsylvania book. “I wish we could go home! HOME! HOME! HOME!”

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Master Librarians

Warm air washed over Jack. It felt wonderful.

“You have succeeded in your quest,” said a soft, soothing voice. “Are you glad to be home?”

Jack opened his eyes. Morgan le Fay stood in the moonlight.

“Yes,” he said.

“We solved all our riddles,” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You have proved that you can find answers to very hard questions.”

She reached into the folds of her robe and took out two thin pieces of wood.

“A magic library card for each of you,” she said.

She gave one to Annie and one to Jack.

“Oh, man,” said Jack, feeling the card.

The wooden card was as thin and smooth as an ordinary library card. On its surface shimmered the letters M and L.



“These are your Master Librarian cards,” said Morgan. “You are the newest members of the ancient Society of Master Librarians.”

“What do we do with them?” asked Jack.

“Take them on your future journeys,” said Morgan. “Only a very wise person or another Master Librarian will be able to see the letters. These will be the people who can help you.”

“Wow,” said Annie. “Can we go on a mission right now?”

“Now you must go home and rest,” said Morgan. “I will come back for you soon.”

Jack and Annie put their secret cards in their pockets. Then Jack took out the Arctic book and put it with the other books.

“Good-bye,” he said.

“See you soon,” Annie said to Morgan.

Morgan gave them a little wave.

Jack and Annie climbed down the rope ladder.

As soon as they stepped onto the dark ground, they heard a roar. They looked up. They saw a blur of wind and light high in the oak tree.

Then all was silent.

Morgan and her magic tree house were gone.

Jack reached for his magic library card. When he felt its tingly warmth, he knew that amazing adventures lay ahead.

“Let’s go,” he said.

He turned on his flashlight.

“The woods don’t feel scary like they did before,” said Annie as they walked through the trees. “I’m not afraid anymore.”

“Me neither,” said Jack.

“Hey, the darkness is like a mask,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “It hides the day, but it brings out your courage.”

They came out of the woods.

Jack saw their house in the distance. It looked warm and cozy.

The porch light glowed. The moon shone overhead.

“Home,” he whispered.

“Home,” said Annie.

She started running. Jack took off after her, running to the place that they both loved the best.

Jack reached into his drawer and took out his secret library card. He held the thin piece of wood and ran his finger over its shimmering letters: M L.

“Master Librarian,” he whispered.

Jack couldn’t believe that he and his sister, Annie, were finally Master Librarians.

He wondered if he should pack the secret card to take on vacation. His family was about to leave for a week in the mountains.

Just then Annie stuck her head into Jack’s room.

“Want to check the woods?” she asked.

Every morning, they looked in the Frog Creek woods to see if Morgan le Fay and her magic tree house had returned.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “We’re leaving soon.”

“But what if Morgan’s there?” said Annie. “What if she’s waiting for us?”

“Oh, okay,” said Jack. “Let’s look fast.”

He grabbed his backpack. He threw in his notebook, his pencil, and his secret library card. Then he followed Annie downstairs.

“We’ll be back soon!” Annie called.

“Don’t go far!” their dad called. “We’re leaving in twenty minutes.”

“Don’t worry, we’ll be back in ten!” said Annie.

Right, thought Jack. Five minutes to the woods, and five minutes back. Even if Morgan sent them on an adventure, they would return at exactly the same time that they left.

Jack and Annie ran out their front door. In the bright morning sunshine, they hurried across their lawn and down the street.

“I had a nightmare last night,” said Annie.

“What was it?” said Jack.

“I dreamed fires were burning,” said Annie. “Everything was smoky and dark, and the ground was shaking. Do you think it was a warning?”

“Nah,” said Jack. “Nightmares never come true.”

They left the sidewalk and headed into the Frog Creek woods. The woods were quiet and peaceful. They walked between sunlit trees until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“Yay!” said Annie.

There it was—the magic tree house. And Morgan le Fay was waving from the window.

“Hail, Master Librarians,” she said.

Jack and Annie bowed playfully.

“At your service,” said Annie.

“Then come on up!” said Morgan.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up. When they climbed inside the tree house, they found Morgan holding a book and a piece of paper.

“I have an important mission for you,” she said. “Are you ready?”

“Yes!” they both answered.

Jack’s heart pounded. Ever since Morgan had made them Master Librarians, he had been longing for their first mission.

“You know I collect books for Camelot’s library?” she said.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Well, there have been many great libraries lost in history,” said Morgan. “And with them, we have lost many wonderful stories.”

“That’s sad,” said Annie.

“It is,” said Morgan. “But luckily, with the help of the tree house and you two Master Librarians, some of those stories can be saved. Such as this one—”

Morgan showed them the piece of paper. There was strange writing on it:

Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Is that a secret code?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “In a way,” she said. “Actually, it’s the title of a lost story. It’s written in Latin, the language of the ancient Romans of Italy.”

“Ancient Romans?” said Jack. He loved anything to do with ancient Romans.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “This story was in a library in a Roman town. I need you to get it before the library becomes lost forever.”

“No problem!” said Annie.

“Do you have your secret library cards?” asked Morgan.

“Yes,” said Jack.

“Good. Do not lose them. The right people will know what they mean,” said Morgan. “And, as usual, here is a book to help you.”

Morgan handed Jack a book called Life in Roman Times. The cover showed a Roman town with people wearing tunics and sandals.

“That looks great,” said Jack.

“And take this—the name of the story I need,” said Morgan. She handed the piece of paper to Jack, and he put it in his pack.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But remember: In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you. But first you must find it.”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Go now,” Morgan said softly. “And don’t forget what I just told you.”

“Thanks,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book on Roman times. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

“I almost forgot—I’m going to help you blend in!” Morgan shouted above the wind.

“What do you mean?” shouted Jack.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

“Oh, cool,” whispered Annie. “Look at us.”

Dear Readers,





The idea for this Magic Tree House book was inspired by a small article I read in the newspaper. The article said that archaeologists had recently uncovered the ruins of a scroll library in an ancient Roman town. The town, Herculaneum, was buried by a volcano almost 2,000 years ago. The same volcano destroyed a nearby town that might sound more familiar to you—Pompeii.

I have always wanted to write a book about Pompeii, so my imagination got to work. I moved the library over to Pompeii and sent Jack and Annie on a mission to find a lost scroll … just as the volcano is about to erupt.

I hope you’ll enjoy taking this scary journey with them as much as I did!

All my best,

For Louis deWolf-Stein,

who wanted me to

write about Pompeii.




1. A Secret Code

Jack reached into his drawer and took out his secret library card. He held the thin piece of wood and ran his finger over its shimmering letters: M L.

“Master Librarian,” he whispered.

Jack couldn’t believe that he and his sister, Annie, were finally Master Librarians.

He wondered if he should pack the secret card to take on vacation. His family was about to leave for a week in the mountains.

Just then Annie stuck her head into Jack’s room.

“Want to check the woods?” she asked.

Every morning, they looked in the Frog Creek woods to see if Morgan le Fay and her magic tree house had returned.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “We’re leaving soon.”

“But what if Morgan’s there?” said Annie. “What if she’s waiting for us?”

“Oh, okay,” said Jack. “Let’s look fast.”

He grabbed his backpack. He threw in his notebook, his pencil, and his secret library card. Then he followed Annie downstairs.

“We’ll be back soon!” Annie called.

“Don’t go far!” their dad called. “We’re leaving in twenty minutes.”

“Don’t worry, we’ll be back in ten!” said Annie.

Right, thought Jack. Five minutes to the woods, and five minutes back. Even if Morgan sent them on an adventure, they would return at exactly the same time that they left.

Jack and Annie ran out their front door. In the bright morning sunshine, they hurried across their lawn and down the street.

“I had a nightmare last night,” said Annie.

“What was it?” said Jack.

“I dreamed fires were burning,” said Annie. “Everything was smoky and dark, and the ground was shaking. Do you think it was a warning?”

“Nah,” said Jack. “Nightmares never come true.”

They left the sidewalk and headed into the Frog Creek woods. The woods were quiet and peaceful. They walked between sunlit trees until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“Yay!” said Annie.

There it was—the magic tree house. And Morgan le Fay was waving from the window.

“Hail, Master Librarians,” she said.

Jack and Annie bowed playfully.

“At your service,” said Annie.

“Then come on up!” said Morgan.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up. When they climbed inside the tree house, they found Morgan holding a book and a piece of paper.

“I have an important mission for you,” she said. “Are you ready?”

“Yes!” they both answered.

Jack’s heart pounded. Ever since Morgan had made them Master Librarians, he had been longing for their first mission.

“You know I collect books for Camelot’s library?” she said.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Well, there have been many great libraries lost in history,” said Morgan. “And with them, we have lost many wonderful stories.”

“That’s sad,” said Annie.

“It is,” said Morgan. “But luckily, with the help of the tree house and you two Master Librarians, some of those stories can be saved. Such as this one—”

Morgan showed them the piece of paper. There was strange writing on it:

Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Is that a secret code?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “In a way,” she said. “Actually, it’s the title of a lost story. It’s written in Latin, the language of the ancient Romans of Italy.”

“Ancient Romans?” said Jack. He loved anything to do with ancient Romans.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “This story was in a library in a Roman town. I need you to get it before the library becomes lost forever.”

“No problem!” said Annie.

“Do you have your secret library cards?” asked Morgan.

“Yes,” said Jack.

“Good. Do not lose them. The right people will know what they mean,” said Morgan. “And, as usual, here is a book to help you.”

Morgan handed Jack a book called Life in Roman Times. The cover showed a Roman town with people wearing tunics and sandals.

“That looks great,” said Jack.

“And take this—the name of the story I need,” said Morgan. She handed the piece of paper to Jack, and he put it in his pack.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But remember: In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you. But first you must find it.”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Go now,” Morgan said softly. “And don’t forget what I just told you.”

“Thanks,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book on Roman times. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

“I almost forgot—I’m going to help you blend in!” Morgan shouted above the wind.

“What do you mean?” shouted Jack.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

“Oh, cool,” whispered Annie. “Look at us.”



2. The End Is Near

Jack opened his eyes. He pushed his glasses into place.

Morgan was gone. And so were Jack’s jeans, T-shirt, sneakers, and backpack.

Instead, he had on a white tunic with a belt, sandals that laced up, and a leather bag.

He looked at Annie. She was dressed the same way. Morgan had made them look just like kids in an ancient Roman town.

“I guess this is what Morgan meant,” said Jack, “when she said she’d help us blend in.”

“I feel like Cinderella,” said Annie. “I like these clothes.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, although he felt a little as if he was wearing a dress.

Annie looked out the window.

“It’s pretty here,” she said.

Jack looked with her. They had landed in a grove of trees. On one side of the grove rose a gentle-looking mountain. On the other, a town sparkled in the sunlight.

“I wonder where we are,” said Jack. He opened the book about Roman times. He read aloud:

Almost 2,000 years ago, on August 24, A.D. 79, the seaside town of Pompeii (pom-PAY) was a typical Roman town. Many Romans went there on their vacation. They built large houses called villas and planted groves of olive trees along the slopes of a mountain called Mount Vesuvius (vuh-SOO-vee-us).



Annie kept looking out the window as Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:



Jack looked out the window again.

“It does look like a nice place to go on vacation,” he said.

“We must have landed in one of the olive groves,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and that town must be Pompeii,” said Jack.

He looked in the opposite direction. “And that mountain must be Mount Vesuvius.”

Annie shivered. “That name sounds scary,” she said.

“Really?” said Jack. “Not to me.” He looked down at his notes.

“Hey! Did you feel that?” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked up.

“The ground shook. I heard it rumble, too,” said Annie.

Jack frowned. “I think you were just dreaming again,” he said.

“No, I wasn’t,” said Annie. “Something feels wrong about this place. I really think we should go home now.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “We have to find that lost story for Morgan. Besides, I’ve always wanted to see a Roman town.”

He threw his notebook and the Roman book into his leather bag. Then he went down the rope ladder.

“Come on!” he called when he stepped onto the ground.

Annie just stared down at him.

“Don’t be chicken,” he said. He pushed his glasses into place. “Come on. It’ll be fun.”

Annie still didn’t move.

What’s wrong with her? Jack wondered. Usually I’m the worried one.

“Come on,” he pleaded. “We can’t let Morgan down.”

Annie let out a big sigh. “Okay, but we’d better find that story fast,” she said. Finally she climbed down the rope ladder.

The sun was bright and hot as they took off between the olive trees.

With Mount Vesuvius at their backs, they headed for the town of Pompeii.

“That’s weird,” said Annie. “I don’t hear any birds.”

She was right. The grove was strangely silent.



“Don’t worry about it,” said Jack. “Maybe they’re all at the beach. Come on—let’s go over that bridge.”

He led the way to a small wooden bridge that crossed a narrow stream. But when they got to the stream, they found it had dried up.

“That’s really weird,” said Annie.

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “It just means there hasn’t been much rain.”

They crossed the bridge and stepped onto a busy street. It was paved with stone.

People were buying things in the open shops that lined the street. Some looked rushed and busy. Others moved slowly. Kids walked with their parents. Groups of teenagers talked and laughed.

They don’t seem very different from people shopping in Frog Creek, Jack thought. Except for the clothes, of course.

“How will we ever find the ancient lost library?” said Annie, glancing around.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Just be on the lookout.”

They walked past shops that had huge jars in them. When Jack looked closely, he saw that they were filled with grain, dried fruit, and olives. Meat hung from the ceilings of some of the stores.

They passed a noisy tavern where people were eating and drinking. A young man played a stringed instrument.

“See, there’s nothing to worry about,” said Jack. “This place isn’t all that different from our time.”

“It’s not that,” said Annie with a worried look.

“See, there’s a barbershop and a shoe shop,” said Jack, pointing.

A boy was getting his hair cut by the barber. A girl was trying on a new pair of sandals with her mother.

“It is kind of like home,” Annie agreed.

They kept walking, until they passed a bakery filled with freshly baked flat breads.

“That bread is like pizza,” said Annie, smiling.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

The good smells from the bakery made him feel even more at home. Jack looked at Annie. She was still smiling as they walked on.

Soon they came to a large square filled with people, carts and horses, and more shopping stalls.

“Honey cakes! Stuffed dates! Peacock eggs!” sellers called.

Farmers were selling grapes, garlic, and onions. Fishermen were selling all kinds of fish. A few people stood on boxes, giving speeches to small crowds.

“Hey, I bet this is the forum!” said Jack. He reached in his bag for his book. He flipped through it until he found a picture of the square. He read:

The center of a Roman town was called a forum. The forum was the main place where people met to sell goods and discuss politics.



“I was right!” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook. He wrote:



“Jack,” whispered Annie. “Jack!” She tugged on his tunic. “Look.”

Jack glanced up. Annie nodded toward an old woman who was staring straight at them.

She wore a black cloak. Her gray hair was tangled and wild. She seemed to be missing her teeth.

The woman pointed a bony finger at Jack and Annie.

“The end is near!” she said in a raspy voice. “Go home, strangers!”

“Yikes,” said Annie.

“We’d better get away from her,” said Jack, “before people wonder who we are.”

He put away his notebook. Then he and Annie hurried away. The old woman cackled behind them.



3. Gladiators!

Jack and Annie hid behind a fruit stall. They waited for a moment, then peered around the corner.

“I don’t see her,” said Jack.

“Who was she?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know. But she looked nuts to me,” said Jack.

“What’s the book say about her?” said Annie.

“She won’t be in there,” said Jack.

“Just look,” said Annie.

Jack sighed and pulled out the book again. To his surprise he found a picture of the old woman. He read aloud:

In Roman times, there were people who could see into the future and warn others about what they saw. These people were called soothsayers.



“See? She wasn’t nuts,” said Annie. “She was giving us a warning. Just like my nightmare.”

“Don’t pay attention to that stuff,” said Jack. “Soothsayers are from olden times. People from our time don’t believe in them.”

“Well, I do,” said Annie. “I’m sure something bad is about to happen.”

Jack sighed. “Come on, we have to keep going. We have to find the lost library. Then we’ll leave at once.”

“We’d better,” said Annie.

They left the fruit stand and kept walking through the forum. Soon they came to a large building. Crowds were streaming in and out of it.

“Is that a library?” said Annie.

“Let’s look,” said Jack. He looked in the Roman book. He found a picture of the building and read aloud:

Most people in Pompeii did not have a bathtub at home, so they went daily to the Public Baths. Not only did people wash at the baths, but they also swam, played sports, and visited with their friends.



“That sounds like going to the pool,” said Annie. “But it’s not a library. Let’s keep walking.”

They kept walking, until soon they came to a fancy building with large columns.

“Is that a library?” said Annie. Jack found a picture of the building and read aloud:

The people of Pompeii believed that many gods and goddesses ruled the world. This is the Temple of Jupiter, their chief god. In this temple, they prayed to Jupiter and offered him gifts. Today, we call the stories about Jupiter and other gods and goddesses “myths.”





“My teacher read myths to us,” said Jack. “I remember stories about Hercules and Apollo.”

“Yeah, my teacher read them, too,” said Annie. “I like stories about Venus and Medusa.”

“Hey, maybe the story we’re looking for is a myth,” said Jack.

“Right,” said Annie. “Come on, hurry. Let’s keep looking.”

They left the forum and turned onto a wide street. Jack gasped. In front of them was an incredible sight.

Tall warriors with huge muscles were walking in a line. They wore fancy helmets and carried heavy shields.

Soldiers, thought Jack.

Then he saw that the warriors’ feet were chained together, and guards walked with them.

“Gladiators!” he whispered.



4. Scary Things

Jack pulled out his book and found a picture of the strong men. He read aloud:

Gladiators were slaves or criminals who fought in the amphitheater (AM-fuh- thee-uh-ter). They were forced to fight each other or wild animals like lions or bears. The people of Pompeii thought a gladiator fight was great fun.



“That’s not fun!” said Annie. “No wonder I think it’s weird here.”

“No kidding,” said Jack. “That’s not like our time at all.”

Jack and Annie watched as the guards led the gladiators away. They went toward a building that looked like an outdoor stadium.

“That must be the amphitheater,” said Jack. “Let’s check it out.”

“Oh, all right, but it’s not a library,” said Annie.

He and Annie started up the street toward the amphitheater. A large crowd had gathered near the entrance. Men and women cheered as the gladiators marched inside.

Jack and Annie started to follow them, but a guard held up his spear.

“No children allowed,” he said stiffly. “Run along now.”

“Yes, run along! Run for your lives!” came a raspy, hissing voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around. It was the soothsayer. She was waving her bony finger at them.

“Oh, no! Her again!” said Jack. “Let’s get away from here.” He started to take off.

“Wait!” said Annie. “I want to talk to her!”

“Are you crazy?” said Jack.

But before he could stop her, Annie ran up to the soothsayer.

Jack watched from a distance as the woman talked to Annie.

“Jack, come here! Quick!” called Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He sighed and went over to Annie and the soothsayer.

“Tell him,” said Annie.

The woman fixed her gaze on Jack.

“All the streams of Pompeii have dried up,” she said.

“Remember the stream near the olive grove?” said Annie.

“So what?” said Jack. “Maybe they just need rain.”

“No,” said Annie. “There’re more scary things. Tell him.”

“All the birds have flown away,” the soothsayer said.

Jack just stared at her.

“She said that all the rats left, too,” said Annie. “And the cows are making strange noises!”

“But why?” said Jack.

“The sea is boiling hot,” the old woman said. “And the ground shakes and speaks.”

“See, I told you!” Annie said to Jack.

“But why are these things happening?” Jack asked the soothsayer.

“Because the end is near,” she whispered hoarsely.

“We have to leave now!” said Annie.

“But what about the library?” said Jack.

“What library?” the soothsayer asked.

“Show her the story title, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack took the piece of paper from his bag. He showed the Latin writing to the soothsayer. “A book with this title is in a library in this town,” he said.

“So?” the old woman said.

“So we have to save it!” said Annie. She pulled out her secret library card.

The soothsayer stared for a moment at the card and the shimmering letters on it. Then she smiled warmly at Jack and Annie.



“Yes, I understand now,” she said. “The only library I know is in the house of Brutus.” She pointed to a large villa at the end of the street. “Look there. Quickly.”

“Will Brutus mind?” said Jack.

“Brutus and his household are all in Rome,” the soothsayer said. “That is merely their vacation villa.”

“But we can’t just go in and take something of theirs,” said Jack.

The old woman shook her head sadly. “After today, there will be nothing left in Pompeii,” she said. “Nothing at all.”

Jack felt a chill go down his spine.

“Go and get what you came here for,” said the soothsayer. “Then leave at once.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He grabbed Annie’s hand. “Come on!”

“Thanks!” Annie called to the old woman. “You should leave, too!” she added.

Then Annie and Jack started running to the vacation villa. They ran as fast as they could.



5. Books? Books?

Jack and Annie ran up to the front entrance of the villa. Jack pushed the door open.

“Go in. Hurry,” said Annie.

They slipped into the main hall.

“Hello!” Annie called.

There was no answer. The place seemed empty.

The main hall had a large opening in the ceiling. Below it was a small stone pool filled with water. Jack looked at it carefully.

“Oh, I bet rain comes through the hole,” said Jack. “Then it lands in that pool so they can use it for their water.”

He started to take out his notebook to make a note.

“There’s no time, Jack!” said Annie. “We have to look in all the rooms for books!”

“Okay, okay, calm down,” said Jack. He put away his notebook and followed Annie.

“Books? Books?” she said, peering into a room off the hall. She moved to the next room. “Books? Books?” Then she moved on to the next.

Jack trailed behind her. Even though she had already checked the rooms, he took a quick peek in each of them. He wanted to see what a house in Roman times looked like. He’d write notes later.

The first two rooms had wooden beds. The walls had pictures painted on them. The floors were covered with tiny pieces of colored stone.

The third room had a low table with silver dishes on it. Three sloping couches were placed around the table. The couches were covered with pillows.

“This must be the dining room,” said Jack. “People from Roman times lay down on couches while they ate. Did you know that?”

He looked around for Annie. Where was she?

“Jack! Come here!” Annie called.

Jack followed her voice. She was in a garden off the dining room. It had a stone patio, palm trees, and grape vines. In the middle was a pond with a mermaid fountain. Goldfish swam in the water.

“Look, there’s another room!” said Annie. She moved to the door of a room off the garden.

She opened the door and peeked inside.

Jack looked with her. Along the walls of the room were long shelves with rolls of paper on them.



“Rats!” said Annie. “No books.” She closed the door. “No books in this whole villa. Let’s get out of here.”

“Just a minute,” said Jack. “I have an idea.”

He pulled out his book on Roman times. He found a section called WRITING. He read:

Romans used pens made of small reeds. Their ink came partly from the black ink of octopuses. They wrote their “books” on scrolls of papyrus (puh-PI-rus) paper.



“Aha!” said Jack. “That’s a library of scrolls! I bet our ancient lost story is in there!”



6. The End Is Here

Jack threw open the door to the room of scrolls. He and Annie rushed in and ran over to the shelves.

Jack pulled out the piece of paper with the Latin title on it:

Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Okay,” he said. “We have to find the scroll with this title.”

They began frantically unrolling scrolls one by one. They were all handwritten in Latin.

“Here it is!” said Annie.

She held up a scroll. The words at the top matched the ones on their paper.

“Yay,” said Jack. “I wish I could read Latin so we could find out what the story is.”

“Don’t think about it now!” said Annie. “Let’s go!”

Annie handed the scroll to Jack, then started out of the room.

“Come on,” she said. “Bring it!”

“I just want to check and see what the story’s about,” said Jack.

He put the scroll in the leather bag. Then he flipped through the book on Roman times, looking for a picture of the ancient scroll. In the middle of the book, he found a picture of a volcano erupting over a town.

Under the picture was written:

For 800 years, Mount Vesuvius was a peaceful mountain, rising above the town of Pompeii. Then, at noon on August 24, A.D. 79, it erupted into a deadly volcano.



“Oh, no,” whispered Jack. “August 24, A.D. 79—that’s today! Oh, man, what time is it?” He looked around wildly. “Annie!”

She was gone again.

“Annie!”

Jack grabbed the leather bag. Then, clutching the book, he tore out of the scroll room.

“Annie!” he cried.

“What?” Annie appeared at the door to the dining room.

“V-v-volcano!” stuttered Jack.

“What?” said Annie.

“It’s—it’s coming—a volcano—at noon!” said Jack.

Annie gasped.

“What time is it?” cried Jack.

“So that’s what the soothsayer meant!” Annie said. “The end is near.”

“What time is it?” Jack asked again. He looked around the garden.

He saw something near the mermaid fountain.

“A sundial!” he said. “That’s how the Romans told time!”

Jack and Annie raced to the sundial.

“What time does it say?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

His hands shook as he turned the pages of the book. He stopped on a picture of a sundial. It showed examples of different times. Jack looked back and forth from the page to the real sundial in the garden.



“Here!” he said. He had found the one that matched. Jack read the writing under the picture:

The shadow on the sundial can hardly be seen at noon.



“Oh, man,” he whispered. He looked at Annie. “The end isn’t near; the end is here.”

Just then he heard a terrible blast. It was the loudest sound he had ever heard.



7. The Sky Is Falling

The next thing Jack knew, he was lying on the stone patio. The patio stones were trembling. A rumbling sound came from the ground.

Jack raised his head. Annie was on the ground, too.

“You okay?” said Annie.

Jack nodded.

Everything was shaking and crashing down around them—pots, plants, the mermaid fountain. Water from the goldfish pond sloshed onto the patio and Jack and Annie.

They both jumped up just as roof tiles began falling into the garden.

“We better get inside!” said Jack.

He grabbed his leather bag. Then he and Annie stumbled into the scroll library.

Giant cracks split the stone floor as Jack and Annie ran to a window and looked out.

Glowing rocks were bursting through the sky above Mount Vesuvius. The whole top of the mountain had blown off.

“What’s happening?” said Annie.

“I’ll check—” said Jack. He pulled out the Roman book. He read aloud from the section about the volcano:

When a volcano erupts, hot melted rock called “magma” is pushed to the surface of the earth. Once it gets outside the volcano, it’s called “lava.”



“Lava! That’s like burning mud!” said Jack.

“It covers everything!” cried Annie.

Jack kept reading:

There was no running lava from Mount Vesuvius. The magma from the volcano cooled so fast that it froze into small grayish white rocks called pumice (PUM-iss). A pumice rock is very light and has holes like a sponge.



“That doesn’t sound too bad,” said Annie.

“Wait, there’s more,” said Jack. He read on:

A great cloud of pumice, ash, and burning rock shot miles into the air. When it rained down on Pompeii, it completely buried the town.



“Oh, man,” said Jack. “This is a major disaster!”

“It’s getting dark,” said Annie.

Jack looked out again. A thick black cloud was spreading over the earth like an umbrella. The sun vanished as the sky turned smoky gray.

“That must be the cloud of pumice and ash!” said Jack.

Just then the ground trembled again. Chunks of plaster from the ceiling fell on the scrolls.

“We have to get out of here!” said Annie.

They ran from the scroll library into the garden. Ash and pumice began to fall.

“We have to cover our heads!” said Jack.

They hurried from the garden into the dining room.

“Look! Pillows!” said Annie. “Let’s put them on our heads!”

They hurried to the couches beside the table and each grabbed a pillow.

“Tie it around your head with your belt!” said Jack.

They both pulled off the belts from around their tunics. Then they tied on the pillows, like giant hats.

A chunk of ceiling crashed down near them.

“Let’s get out of here!” said Jack.

They stepped over pieces of fallen roof tiles and ran into the main hall. They pushed open the front door.

A blast of heat and dust nearly knocked them over. And when they stepped outside, pumice rained down onto their pillow hats.

“Run!” cried Annie.

They ran from the vacation villa into the dark, burning streets.



8. Nightmare at Noon

In the distance, fire burst from Mount Vesuvius. Burning rocks and fiery ash fell from the sky.

The hot, dusty air smelled like rotten eggs as Jack and Annie rushed down the street. In the forum, everyone—shoppers, soldiers, gladiators, fruit sellers—was running in every direction.

Stalls had collapsed. Carts were sliding.

Jack froze. He didn’t know where to go.



“That way!” shouted Annie.

Jack followed her as they ran past the Temple of Jupiter. Its mighty columns had fallen, and its walls were crumbling.

They ran past the Public Baths just as its roof caved in.

“Which way now?” shouted Annie.

“The tree house is in the olive grove!” Jack said as they kept running.

“The olive grove and the bridge are near the street with all those open shops!” said Annie. “Remember the bridge?”

Jack looked up at the erupting mountain. A red-hot cloud billowed over it. Fires burned on its slopes.

“Head in the direction of Mount Vesuvius!” he said. “It was behind us as we came into Pompeii.”

“Right!” cried Annie.

So while others ran away from Mount Vesuvius, Jack and Annie ran toward it.

On the street with the open shops, baskets and broken jars rolled over the cracked stones.

Jack and Annie ran past the bakery and the shoe shop. They ran past the butcher shop and barbershop. All the shops were empty. Their owners had fled.

The closer they got to the volcano, the more the ground trembled. The darker and dustier it got.

“This is just like my nightmare!” cried Annie.

Jack choked on the rotten fumes. His eyes watered.

“Look! The olive grove!” shouted Annie. “The tree house is just over there! Come on!”

Jack could hardly see, but he followed Annie. They left the street and ran to the dried-up stream near the olive grove.

“Where’s the bridge?” cried Annie.

They looked around wildly. The bridge had vanished.



9. Save Us!

“The bridge must have caved in!” cried Annie.

They stared at the dried-up stream. Pumice had piled up in huge drifts, like snow.

“We’ll have to get through that stuff to get across!” said Jack.

He and Annie slid down the bank onto the piles of pumice. As they started to move across it, more and more fell.

Jack tried to move through the millions of warm, grayish white pebbles. But he was trapped.

“I’m stuck!” cried Annie.

“Me too!” said Jack.

“Remember what Morgan said!” said Annie.

At the moment, Jack couldn’t remember anything. He was too tired and dazed.

“ ‘In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you!’ ” cried Annie. “Where’s your bag?”

Jack lifted his bag into the air, above the sea of pumice. Annie grabbed it and pulled out the ancient scroll. She held it up to the dark sky.

“Save us, story!” she shouted.

Jack felt himself sink deeper and deeper into the pumice. Suddenly he heard a deep voice say, “Rise, son!”

Then someone lifted Jack up into the air.



A great flash of fire lit the dusty darkness. In the red light, Jack saw the biggest, strongest man he’d ever seen in his life. The man looked like a gladiator—but even bigger than the ones they had seen earlier.

He held Jack with one hand and Annie with the other. He placed them both on the other bank of the stream.

“Run!” the giant gladiator boomed. “Before it’s too late!”

Jack and Annie didn’t stop to ask any questions. Together, they charged through the olive grove.

They jumped over fallen branches. They leaped over great cracks in the earth. Finally they came to the tree with the magic tree house.

They grabbed the rope ladder and scrambled up to the tree house.

“Where’s the Pennsylvania book?” Jack shouted. He was too blinded by ash and dust to find the book that always took them home.

“I’ve got it!” cried Annie. “I wish we could go there!”

Jack felt the tree house start to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely, wonderfully, peacefully still.



10. A Simple Explanation

Jack didn’t move. He had never been so tired in all his life.

“Breathe,” said Annie.

Jack gulped in cool, clean air. He opened his eyes. He couldn’t see a thing.

“Take off your glasses,” said Annie. “They’re filthy.”

Jack took off his glasses. The first thing he saw was his backpack. The white tunics and lace-up sandals were gone. So were their pillow hats and the leather bag.

Jack let out a long, deep breath. As he cleaned his glasses on his shirt, a voice came from behind him. “I’m very glad to see you safe and sound.”

Morgan le Fay stood in the corner of the tree house. She looked as lovely and mysterious as ever.

“Happy to be home?” she asked.

Jack nodded. The sound of the erupting volcano still echoed in his ears.

“It—it was pretty scary,” he said in a hoarse voice.

“I know. But you were truly brave,” said Morgan. “You witnessed a famous event in history. Nowadays, scientists study the remains of Pompeii to find out more about Roman times.”

“I feel bad for all those people,” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “But most of the people of Pompeii did escape. The city wasn’t completely buried by ash until the next day.”

“We were almost trapped,” said Annie. “But we asked the ancient story to save us. Then a huge gladiator helped us.”

Jack reached into his pack. He breathed a sigh of relief. The scroll was still there! He took it out. It was covered with dust and ashes.

“Here’s the story,” said Jack.

He handed it to Morgan.



“I am deeply grateful,” she said softly. “You risked everything to bring this to me. I can never thank you enough.”

“Don’t worry about it,” said Jack. He didn’t want Morgan to know how scared he had been.

“Yeah, no problem,” said Annie.

Morgan smiled. “You are amazing Master Librarians,” she said. “Do you think you’re up to rescuing another ancient story?”

“Yes!” said Annie.

“Now?” said Jack. Actually he was a little tired now.

Morgan laughed. “No. Take a nice vacation. Come back two weeks from today. Then you will take a trip to ancient China,” she said.

“Ancient China? Wow,” said Annie.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

“Go home now and rest,” said Morgan. She handed Jack his pack.

“Thanks,” he said. “Bye.”

“Bye,” said Annie.

Morgan gave them a little wave. Then Annie and Jack left the tree house and headed down the rope ladder. When they reached the ground, Jack looked up.

“Morgan,” he called. “What is that story about—the one we just rescued?”

“It’s called The Strongest Man in the World,” said Morgan. “It’s a lost tale about Hercules.”

“Hercules?” said Jack.

“Yes, he was one of the heroes of the Greeks and the Romans,” said Morgan. “He was a son of Jupiter.”

“Oh, wow. Now I get it,” said Annie.

“I’m taking it back now to Camelot’s library,” said Morgan. “Everyone will be so excited to read it, thanks to you.” She waved to them. “Good-bye for now!”

As she waved, the wind began to whirl. The tree house began to spin. In a blur of shadow and light, Morgan and the magic tree house were gone.

Jack and Annie started walking through the woods.

“Get it? Get it?” said Annie.

“Get what?” said Jack.

“We were saved by Hercules!” said Annie. “We asked the story to save us—and Hercules appeared!”

“That’s not possible,” said Jack. “It was just some gladiator guy. The story of Hercules is a myth. That means he never really lived.”

They left the woods and started up their street.

“I know it’s a myth,” said Annie. “But I have a simple explanation.”

“What?” said Jack.

“Hercules is a myth to people in this time,” said Annie. “But in Roman times, lots of people believed he was real. So, since we were in Roman times, he was real to us.”

“I don’t know … ” said Jack.

“Did you ever hear the saying?” said Annie. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.”

Jack laughed. “Yeah.” He looked up at the sky. “Thanks, Hercules,” he said softly, “whatever you are.”

“Jack! Annie!” their dad called from their front porch. “Time to go!”

“Oh, brother, I forgot,” said Jack.

“Yeah, I hope nothing exciting happens on our vacation,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “I hope it’s really, really boring.”

“Hurry!” their dad said.

“Coming!” they called.

Then they took off running for home—and a restful vacation.





More Facts for You and Jack





1) Pompeii was forgotten after it was buried in ash and pumice. In 1594, the ruined city was discovered by workmen who were digging a tunnel. Later, a nearby town called Herculaneum was also discovered. It had been buried by boiling mud after the volcano erupted. Many things from everyday life have been uncovered in both Pompeii and Herculaneum. Recently, a library of scrolls was found.

2) The language of the ancient Romans was called Latin. Many words in the English, French, and Spanish languages come from Latin. For example, liber means “book” and libri means “books” in Latin. The word “book” in Spanish is libro and in French is livre. In English we have the word “library.”

3) Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year A.D. 79. The letters “A.D.” stand for the words anno Domini. Anno Domini means “in the year of the Lord” in Latin, which refers to the year Jesus Christ was born—about 2,000 years ago.

4) The Romans took their name from the city of Rome, which was the capital of their empire. Rome is now the capital of the country of Italy.

5) In A.D. 79, the Romans had a powerful army. They ruled all of Western Europe, the Near East, and North Africa.

6) Hercules is the Roman name for the hero from the Greek myths known as Heracles. After the Romans conquered ancient Greece, they adopted many of Greece’s heroes and gods and goddesses. Heracles—who became Hercules—was one of them.

Annie peeked into Jack’s room.

“Ready to go to China?” she asked.

Jack took a deep breath.

“Sure,” he answered.

“Bring your secret library card,” Annie said. “I have mine in my pocket.”

“Yep,” said Jack.

He opened his top dresser drawer and took out a thin wooden card. The letters M L on it shimmered in the light. Jack dropped the card into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and a pencil.

“Let’s go,” said Annie.

Jack pulled on his pack and followed her.

What are we in for today? he wondered.

“Bye, Mom!” said Annie as they passed their mom in the kitchen.

“Where are you going?” she asked.

“China!” said Annie.

“Great,” said their mom. She winked at them. “Have fun.”

Fun? thought Jack. He was afraid that fun wasn’t quite the right word.

“Just wish us luck,” he said as he and Annie headed out the front door.

“Good luck!” their mother called.

“If only she knew we aren’t pretending,” Jack whispered to Annie.

“Yeah,” said Annie, grinning.

Outside, the sun shone brightly. Birds sang. Crickets chirped. Jack and Annie walked up their street toward the Frog Creek woods.

“I wonder if the weather will be this nice in China,” Annie said.

“I don’t know. Remember, Morgan said this would be a very scary adventure,” said Jack.

“They’re always scary,” said Annie. “But we always meet animals who help us, or people.”

“True,” said Jack.

“I bet we meet someone great today,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He was starting to feel excited now instead of scared.

“Let’s hurry!” he said.

They ran into the Frog Creek woods. They slipped between the tall trees until they came to a huge oak.

“Hello!” came a soft voice they knew well.

They looked up. Morgan was peering down from the magic tree house.

“Ready for your next mission as Master Librarians?” she asked.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

“Are we still going to China?” asked Annie when they had climbed into the tree house.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You’re going to ancient China. Here is the title of the story you must find.”

She held up a long, thin strip of wood. It looked like a ruler, except it had strange writing on it instead of numbers.



“Long ago, the Chinese discovered how to make paper. It was one of the world’s most important discoveries,” said Morgan. “But you are going to a time earlier than that, to a time when books were written on bamboo strips like this one.”

“Wow,” said Annie, pointing at the figures on the bamboo. “So this is Chinese writing?”

“Yes,” said Morgan. “Just as we have letters, Chinese writing is made up of many characters. Each one stands for a different thing or idea. These characters are the title of an ancient Chinese legend. You must find the first writing of the legend before the Imperial Library is destroyed.”

“Hurry, let’s go,” said Annie.

“Wait, we need our research book,” said Jack.

“Yes, you do,” said Morgan.

From the folds of her robe, she pulled out a book. On the cover was the title: The Time of the First Emperor.

Morgan handed the book to Jack.

“This research book will guide you,” she said. “But remember, in your darkest hour, only the old legend can save you.”

“But we have to find it first,” said Annie.

“Exactly,” said Morgan.

She handed Jack the bamboo strip, and he slipped it into his pack.

Jack pushed his glasses into place, then pointed at the cover of their research book.

“I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

I have long wanted to send Jack and Annie to China, but I couldn’t figure out what period of history they should visit. Then one day, when I was reading in my local library, I stumbled across some amazing information. In the 1970s, archaeologists began excavating a great wonder in China: an ancient burial tomb with over 7,000 statues of soldiers and horses. The tomb was more than 2,000 years old and had been built for the first Chinese emperor.

After I learned this, I found other library books about that period of Chinese history, and I spent days reading and taking notes. From these notes, I fashioned Day of the Dragon King.

Have I told you before that libraries are very important to me? They are my magic places … where I dream and wonder … and spin my stories.

Visit your library and I bet you’ll find the same magic!





All my best,

For Peter and Andrew Boyce





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House #12, Polar Bears Past Bedtime, Jack and Annie solved the last of four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the letters M L on them.

Jack and Annie’s first four missions as Master Librarians are to save stories from ancient libraries. When their first adventure ended (Magic Tree House #13, Vacation Under the Volcano), Morgan asked them to return to the tree house in two weeks to go to China and save another story.

Now the two weeks are over …



1. The Bamboo Book

Annie peeked into Jack’s room.

“Ready to go to China?” she asked.

Jack took a deep breath.

“Sure,” he answered.

“Bring your secret library card,” Annie said. “I have mine in my pocket.”

“Yep,” said Jack.

He opened his top dresser drawer and took out a thin wooden card. The letters M L on it shimmered in the light. Jack dropped the card into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and a pencil.

“Let’s go,” said Annie.

Jack pulled on his pack and followed her.

What are we in for today? he wondered.

“Bye, Mom!” said Annie as they passed their mom in the kitchen.

“Where are you going?” she asked.

“China!” said Annie.

“Great,” said their mom. She winked at them. “Have fun.”

Fun? thought Jack. He was afraid that fun wasn’t quite the right word.

“Just wish us luck,” he said as he and Annie headed out the front door.

“Good luck!” their mother called.

“If only she knew we aren’t pretending,” Jack whispered to Annie.

“Yeah,” said Annie, grinning.

Outside, the sun shone brightly. Birds sang. Crickets chirped. Jack and Annie walked up their street toward the Frog Creek woods.

“I wonder if the weather will be this nice in China,” Annie said.

“I don’t know. Remember, Morgan said this would be a very scary adventure,” said Jack.

“They’re always scary,” said Annie. “But we always meet animals who help us, or people.”

“True,” said Jack.

“I bet we meet someone great today,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He was starting to feel excited now instead of scared.

“Let’s hurry!” he said.

They ran into the Frog Creek woods. They slipped between the tall trees until they came to a huge oak.

“Hello!” came a soft voice they knew well.

They looked up. Morgan was peering down from the magic tree house.

“Ready for your next mission as Master Librarians?” she asked.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

“Are we still going to China?” asked Annie when they had climbed into the tree house.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You’re going to ancient China. Here is the title of the story you must find.”

She held up a long, thin strip of wood. It looked like a ruler, except it had strange writing on it instead of numbers.



“Long ago, the Chinese discovered how to make paper. It was one of the world’s most important discoveries,” said Morgan. “But you are going to a time earlier than that, to a time when books were written on bamboo strips like this one.”

“Wow,” said Annie, pointing at the figures on the bamboo. “So this is Chinese writing?”

“Yes,” said Morgan. “Just as we have letters, Chinese writing is made up of many characters. Each one stands for a different thing or idea. These characters are the title of an ancient Chinese legend. You must find the first writing of the legend before the Imperial Library is destroyed.”

“Hurry, let’s go,” said Annie.

“Wait, we need our research book,” said Jack.

“Yes, you do,” said Morgan.

From the folds of her robe, she pulled out a book. On the cover was the title: The Time of the First Emperor.

Morgan handed the book to Jack.

“This research book will guide you,” she said. “But remember, in your darkest hour, only the old legend can save you.”

“But we have to find it first,” said Annie.

“Exactly,” said Morgan.

She handed Jack the bamboo strip, and he slipped it into his pack.

Jack pushed his glasses into place, then pointed at the cover of their research book.

“I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. The Cowherd

“Oh, wow,” Annie said. “These clothes feel so soft. And look, I have a pocket for my secret library card.”

Jack opened his eyes. Their clothes had magically changed.

They no longer wore jeans, T-shirts, and sneakers. Instead, they had on baggy pants, loose shirts, straw shoes, and round hats. Annie’s shirt had a pocket in it.

Jack saw that his backpack had become a rough cloth sack. Inside were his research book, his notebook, his library card, and the bamboo strip.

“Cows,” said Annie, looking out the window.

Jack looked out, too. The tree house had landed in a lone tree in a sunny field. Cows grazed, and a young man stood watching over them. At the edge of the field was a farmhouse. Beyond the house was a walled city.

“It looks so peaceful,” said Annie.

“You can never be sure,” said Jack. “Remember, Pompeii looked peaceful before the volcano went off.”

“Oh, yeah,” said Annie.

“Let’s see what the book says,” said Jack.

He reached in the sack and pulled out the China book. He opened it and read aloud:

Over 2,000 years ago, China was ruled by its first emperor. Because he chose the dragon to be his symbol, he was called the “Dragon King.” In China, dragons are seen as brave and powerful creatures.



“Dragon King? That sounds a little scary,” said Jack.

“I like his outfit,” said Annie.

Next to the writing was a picture. It showed a man wearing a rich, flowing robe with wide sleeves. He also wore a tall hat with beads hanging from it.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“The book we need must be in the Dragon King’s library,” said Annie. “I bet his palace is in that city.”



Jack looked up.

“Right,” he said. “And that’s how to get there.” He pointed across the field to a dirt road that led to the walled city.

“Good plan,” said Annie.

She climbed out of the tree house and started down the rope ladder.

Jack threw the China book and his notebook into his sack. He slung the sack over his shoulder and followed Annie.

When they reached the ground, they started through the field.

“Look, that guy’s waving at us,” said Annie.

The man tending the cows was shouting and waving. He started running toward them.

“Uh-oh, what’s he want?” said Jack.

A moment later, the man stood in their path. He was young and handsome with a kind face.

“Can you do me a great favor?” he asked. “I would be most grateful.”

“Of course,” said Annie.

“Give a message to the silk weaver. You will see her at the farmhouse,” said the young man. “Tell her to meet me here at twilight.”

“Sure, no problem,” said Annie.

The young man smiled.

“Thank you,” he said. Then he started to leave.

“Wait, excuse me—” said Jack. “Do you know where we can find the Imperial Library?”

A look of horror crossed the man’s kind face.

“Why?” he whispered.

“Oh, I—I just wondered,” said Jack.

The young man shook his head.

“Beware of the Dragon King,” he said. “Whatever you do, beware.”

Then he turned and ran back to his cows.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “Now we know one thing for sure.”

“What?” asked Annie.

“This place is not as peaceful as it seems,” Jack said.



3. The Silk Weaver

Jack and Annie kept walking across the pasture toward the road. Annie stopped when they neared the farmhouse.

“We have to find the silk weaver and give her the message,” she said.

“Let’s do that on our way back,” said Jack. “I’m worried about finding the Imperial Library.”

“What if we don’t have time?” said Annie. “We promised. And he was so nice.”

Jack sighed.

“Okay,” he said. “But let’s find her fast. And remember to keep your head down so no one will notice us.”

Jack and Annie bowed their heads as they headed toward the house.

As they got closer, Jack peeked out from under his hat. An ox pulled a cart filled with hay. Men hoed the ground. Women pushed wheelbarrows piled high with grain.

“There!” said Annie. She pointed to an open porch where a young woman was weaving cloth on a loom. “That must be her!”

Annie ran to the silk weaver. Jack looked around to see if anyone was watching. Luckily, all the farmworkers seemed too busy to notice anything. Still looking around carefully, Jack walked toward the porch.

Annie was already talking to the silk weaver.

“What did he say?” the young woman asked. Her voice was soft but strong. Her dark eyes glowed with happiness.

“He said you should meet him in the field at twilight,” said Annie. “He’s so handsome!”

“Yes, he is.” The silk weaver gave Annie a shy smile. Then she reached down to a basket near her loom and picked up a ball of yellow thread.

“It was very brave of you to bring the message,” she said. “Please accept this silk thread as my thank-you.”

She handed Annie the ball of silk.

“It’s beautiful,” said Annie. “Feel.”

She handed it to Jack. The thread was smooth and soft.

“How do you make silk?” said Jack.

“It is made from the cocoons of silkworms,” said the weaver.

“Really? Worms? That’s neat,” said Jack. “Let me write that down.”

He reached into his sack.

“Please don’t!” said the silk weaver. “The making of silk is China’s most valuable secret. Anyone who steals the secret will be arrested. The Dragon King will have him put to death.”



“Oops,” said Jack.

He dropped the ball of silk into his sack.

“I think you must leave quickly,” whispered the silk weaver. “You have been seen.”

Jack looked over his shoulder. A man was pointing at them.

“Let’s go,” he said.

“Bye!” said Annie. “Good luck on your date!”

“Thank you,” the silk weaver said.

“Come on,” said Jack.

They hurried away from the silk weaver.

“Stop!” someone shouted.

“Run!” said Annie.



4. The Great Wall

Jack and Annie ran around the farmhouse. At the back was an oxcart filled with bags of grain. There was no one in sight.

The shouting behind them got louder.

Jack and Annie looked at each other, then dived into the back of the wooden cart. They buried themselves in the middle of the bags of grain.

Jack’s heart pounded as the shouts came closer. He held his breath and waited for the people to leave.

Suddenly the cart lurched forward. Someone was driving them away!

Jack and Annie peeked over the bags. Jack saw the back of the driver. He was calmly steering the oxcart over the dirt road. They were on their way to the walled city!

Jack and Annie ducked down again.

“This is great!” whispered Annie. “All we have to do is jump out when we get into the city.”



“Yep,” Jack said softly. “Then we’ll find the Imperial Library, find the book, and get back to the magic tree house.”

“No problem,” whispered Annie.

“Whoa!” The cart slowly came to a halt.

Jack held his breath. He heard voices and the heavy tramping of feet—lots of feet. He and Annie peeked out.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

A long line of men was crossing the road in front of the cart. They carried axes, shovels, and hoes. Guards marched alongside them.

“Let’s find out what’s happening,” said Jack.

He reached into his sack and pulled out the China book. Pushing his glasses into place, he found a picture of the workers. He read:

The Dragon King forced many of his subjects to start building a wall to protect China from invaders. Later emperors made the wall even longer. Finally, it stretched 3,700 miles along China’s border. The Great Wall of China is the longest structure ever built.



“Wow, the Great Wall of China,” said Jack.

“I’ve heard of that,” said Annie.

“Who hasn’t?” said Jack. “Those guys are going to work on it right now.”

Just then, someone grabbed Jack and Annie. They looked up. It was the driver of the cart.

“Who are you?” he asked angrily.

“We—uh—” Jack didn’t know what to say.

The man’s gaze fell on the open book in Jack’s hands. His mouth dropped open. He let go of Jack and Annie. Slowly he reached out and touched the book. He looked back at Jack and Annie with wide eyes.

“What is this?” he said.



5. The Scholar

“It’s a book from our country,” said Jack. “Your books are made of bamboo, but ours are made of paper. Actually, your country invented paper. But later, in the future.”

The man looked confused.

“Never mind,” said Annie. “It’s for reading. It’s for learning about faraway places.”

The man stared at them. Tears filled his eyes.

“What’s wrong?” Annie asked softly.

“I love reading and learning,” he said.

“So do I,” said Jack.

The man smiled. “You don’t understand! I am dressed as a farmer,” he said. “But in truth, I am a scholar!”

“What’s a scholar?” said Annie.

“We are great readers, learners, and writers,” he said. “We have long been the most honored citizens in China.”

The scholar’s smile faded.

“But now scholars are in danger,” he said. “And many of us have gone into hiding.”

“Why?” said Jack.

“The Dragon King is afraid of the power of our books and learning,” said the scholar. “He wants people to think only what he wants them to think. Any day he may order the burning of the books!”

Annie gasped.

“Does that mean what I think it means?” said Jack.

The scholar nodded.

“All the books in the Imperial Library will be burned,” he said.

“That’s rotten!” said Annie.

“Indeed it is!” the scholar said quietly.

“Listen, we have a mission to get a book from that library,” said Jack.

“Who are you?” asked the scholar.

“Show him,” said Annie.

She reached into her shirt pocket as Jack reached into his sack. They brought out the secret library cards. The letters shimmered in the sunlight.

The scholar’s mouth dropped open again.

“You are Master Librarians,” he said. “I have never met ones so honored who were so young.”



He bowed to show his respect.

“Thank you,” said Jack and Annie.

They bowed back to him.

“How can I help you?” asked the scholar.

“We need to go to the Imperial Library and find this book,” said Jack.

He held out Morgan’s bamboo strip to the scholar.

“We will go to the Imperial Library,” said the scholar. “As for the story, I know it well. It is a true one, written not long ago. But I warn you. We will be in great danger.”

“We know!” said Annie.

The scholar smiled.

“I am happy to be doing something I believe in again,” said the scholar. “Let us go!”

They all climbed into the front of the cart. The long line of wall builders was marching in the distance. As the oxen started forward, the scholar turned to Jack and Annie.

“Where are you from?” he asked.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvania,” said Annie.

“I have never heard of it,” said the scholar. “Do they have a library there?”

“Oh, sure, there’s a library in every town,” said Jack. “In fact, there are probably thousands of libraries in our country.”

“And millions of books,” said Annie. “And no one burns them.”

“Right,” said Jack. “Everyone gets to go to school to learn to read them.”

The scholar stared at him and shook his head.

“It sounds like paradise,” he said.



6. The Dragon King

The oxcart bumped across the wooden bridge that crossed over a moat. Then it passed guards standing by giant wooden gates.

“Are the gates ever closed?” Jack asked.

“Oh, yes, every day at sunset,” said the scholar. “When the gong sounds, the gates close. The bridge comes up. And the city is sealed shut for the night.”

“I guess visitors have to leave before that happens,” Annie said. “Or they’ll be stuck here for the whole night. Right?”

“Yes,” said the scholar.

The cart bumped between the city gates.

Rows of small houses were bunched together on either side of the street. They were made of mud with straw roofs. People cooked over outdoor fires. They washed their clothes in wooden tubs.

As the oxcart bumped along, the houses got larger. These were made of painted wood and pottery tiles. They all had curved roofs.

“Why are those roofs like that?” asked Jack.

“To keep away the bad spirits,” said the scholar.

“How do they do that?” said Annie.

“The spirits can only travel in straight lines,” said the scholar.

“Wow,” whispered Annie.

The cart went by some open tea shops. Then it passed a large market square filled with stalls and shoppers. People were buying and selling fish, chickens, firewood, wagon wheels, silk cloth, furs, and jade jewelry.

Some people were lined up at a stall filled with tiny cages.



“What’s for sale there?” said Annie.

“Crickets,” the scholar said. “They make good pets. You can feed them tea leaves and enjoy their delicate song.”

The cart moved on toward the Dragon King’s walled palace. They stopped in front of the palace gates.

“Grain delivery!” the scholar shouted up to the guard at the tower.

The guard waved them through. Inside were beautiful gardens and huge mounds of earth surrounded by a low brick wall.

“That is the Imperial Burial Grounds,” said the scholar, pointing at the mounds.

“Who is buried there?” asked Jack.

“The ancestors of the Dragon King,” said the scholar.

“What are ancestors?” Annie asked.

“They are the people in your family who lived before you,” said the scholar. “Someday the Dragon King himself will be buried there. Three hundred thousand workers have been building his burial tomb.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

He looked over his shoulder at the burial grounds. He wondered why it took so many workers to build a tomb.

“No!” said the scholar.

Jack whirled around.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

The scholar pointed at the palace courtyard. A dark cloud of smoke was rising into the sky.

“Fire!” said the scholar.

“The books!” said Jack.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

The scholar snapped the reins. The oxen trotted up the stone path. When the cart rolled into the courtyard, soldiers were everywhere.

Some threw wood on a huge bonfire. Others were carrying bamboo strips down the steep stairs that led from the palace.

“Are those books?” asked Jack.

“Yes. The strips are tied together into different bundles,” moaned the scholar. “Each bundle is a book.”

“Look!” said Annie, pointing to the palace entrance.

Stepping outside was a man in a rich, flowing robe and a tall hat. Jack knew him at once—the Dragon King!



7. The Burning of the Books

The Dragon King watched the bonfire as it blazed up toward the sky. Around the fire the air was thick and wavy. Bamboo books were stacked beside the fire, waiting to be burned.

“Hurry!” said the scholar.

They jumped down from the cart and joined the crowd by the bonfire.

The Dragon King shouted to the soldiers. They began throwing the books into the fire. The bamboo crackled as it burned.

“Stop!” cried Annie.

Jack grabbed her.

“Quiet!” he said.

Annie pulled away.

“Stop!” she shouted again. But her voice was lost in the noise of the roaring fire.

“There’s your story!” said the scholar.

He pointed to a bamboo book that had fallen off a waiting stack.

“I’ll get it!” said Annie.

She dashed over to the book.

“Annie!” cried Jack.

But she had already snatched up the bundle of bamboo strips and was charging back to them.

“Got it! Quick, put it in your sack!” she said.

Jack put the bundle of bamboo strips in his sack. Then he looked around fearfully. He gasped.

The Dragon King was glaring at them! Then he headed their way.

“Seize them!” the Dragon King shouted.

“Run through the burial grounds!” the scholar said to Jack and Annie. “The soldiers will be afraid to follow. They fear the spirits of the ancestors!”

“Thanks!” said Jack. “Thanks for everything!”

“Good luck!” cried Annie.

Then she and Jack took off. Soldiers shouted after them. An arrow whizzed by.

But Jack and Annie kept running. They ran down the path to the burial grounds. They jumped over the low brick wall and ran between the huge mounds of earth.

Suddenly arrows filled the air around them. The archers were shooting from the tower!



“Look!” cried Jack.

There was a doorway in one of the mounds. Jack and Annie ducked inside.

They were in a long hall lit with oil lamps.

“It’s so quiet,” said Annie. She walked down the passageway. “Hey, there are some steps here.”

“Don’t go any farther!” said Jack.

“Why not?” said Annie.

“We don’t know what’s down there,” said Jack. “This is a burial tomb, remember? It’s creepy.”

“Let’s just take a quick look,” said Annie. “Maybe it’s the way out of here.”

Jack took a deep breath.

“You might be right,” he said. “Okay, but go slow.” He didn’t want to stumble upon a dead body.

Annie started down the steep steps. Jack followed. The lamps lit their way as they kept going down and down. Finally, they reached the bottom.

Jack blinked. Even though oil lamps glowed everywhere, it was hard to see at first.

When Jack’s eyes got used to the strange light, his heart nearly stopped.

“Oh, man,” he breathed.

They were in a room filled with soldiers—thousands of them.



8. The Tomb

Jack and Annie stood frozen.

The silent soldiers did, too.

Finally, Annie spoke.

“They’re fake,” she said.

“Fake?” whispered Jack.

“They’re not real,” she said.

“They look real,” said Jack.

Annie walked straight toward the front row of soldiers.

Jack held his breath.

Annie pulled the soldier’s nose.

“Fake!” she said.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He walked over to the soldier and touched his painted face. It was as hard as stone.

“It’s amazing,” Jack said.

Annie nodded. “It’s like a museum.”

She walked down a row between two lines of soldiers.

“Wait. This is spooky,” said Jack. “What is this place?”

He put down his sack and pulled out the China book. He found a picture of the frozen army and read aloud:

The Dragon King had 7,000 life-size clay figures made for his burial tomb. The clay was baked and painted.

The Dragon King hoped that the clay army would protect him after he died.



“It’s like the pyramid in ancient Egypt,” said Jack. “Remember? The queen was buried with a boat and lots of things to take to the afterlife.” He looked around. “Annie?”

“I’m here,” she called. She was far down another row.

“Come back here,” yelled Jack.

“No, you come here,” said Annie. “It’s so cool. All their faces are different.”

Jack threw the book into his sack. Then he hurried down the row to Annie.

“Look,” she said. “Just look.”



In the flickering lamplight, they wandered down the rows of soldiers. No two soldiers had the same nose, the same eyes, or the same mouth.

“Oh, man. No wonder so many people had to work on this tomb,” said Jack.

“They really did a good job,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

There were kneeling archers and foot soldiers dressed in red and black armor.

There were real bronze swords, daggers, axes, spears, bows, and arrows.

There were even life-size wooden chariots with horses. The horses looked completely real. They were different colors with white teeth and red tongues.

“I have to take some notes about all this,” said Jack.

He pulled out his notebook and pencil. Then, kneeling on the brick floor, he wrote:



“Ja-ack,” said Annie. “You know what?”

“What?”

“I think we’re lost,” she said.

“Lost?” Jack stood up. “We’re not lost.”

“Yeah? Then which way is out?” said Annie.

Jack looked around. All he could see were rows of soldiers. In front of them, to the right, to the left, behind them—nothing but clay soldiers.

“Which way did we come?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

All the rows looked the same. They stretched out endlessly.

Jack tried not to panic.

“I’d better look this up,” he said.

“Forget it,” said Annie. “Morgan said the research book would guide us. But in our darkest hour, only the ancient legend would save us.”

“Is this our darkest hour?” asked Jack.

Annie nodded. “Yeah, it’s pretty dark.”

It does seem to be getting darker in here, thought Jack. The air was getting thicker, too. It seemed harder to breathe.

“Let’s ask for help,” said Jack.

He reached into the sack and pulled out the bamboo book. He held it up and said, “Save us!”

As Jack waited, the tomb seemed unbearably quiet.

Jack held the book up again. “Please help us find our way out,” he said.

He and Annie kept waiting. But nothing happened.

The air was growing even thicker. The light was getting dimmer. The countless rows of soldiers seemed creepier.

Help did not come.

Jack felt faint. “I—I guess we’ll just have—have to—”

“Look!” Annie said.

“What?”

“The ball of thread! It rolled out of your sack!” she said.

“So what?” said Jack.

He looked at his cloth sack lying on the floor. The ball of yellow silk thread had rolled out. And it was still rolling, leaving a trail of yellow thread!



9. The Silk Path

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But we’d better follow it.”

She hurried after the ball of silk thread.

Jack put the bamboo book into his sack and took off after her.

They followed the trail of thread down the row, where it turned down another row.

“Hey, that’s impossible!” said Jack. “That’s scientifically impossible!”

“I told you, it’s magic!” cried Annie.

Jack couldn’t believe it. But he kept following the thread.

Suddenly the trail of thread was gone. The ball had completely unrolled.

Jack and Annie stood still for a moment and caught their breath.

“What—what now?” said Jack.

“I guess we go up those stairs,” Annie said.

“What stairs?” said Jack.

“There.”



Jack looked through the dim light and saw the entrance to a stairway only a few feet away.

“Let’s get out of here!” he said.

They ran up the stairs. At the top, they saw that they were in the hall that led to the entrance of the mound.

They walked and walked and walked down the lamp-lit passage. Finally, Jack stopped.

“I don’t remember this hall being so long,” he said.

“Me neither,” said Annie. “I guess those weren’t the same stairs that we went down.”

“What should we do now?” said Jack.

“We’d better keep going,” said Annie.

“Yeah, we don’t have much choice,” said Jack.

They started walking again. They rounded a corner and came to a door.

“Oh, great!” said Annie.

“Wait. We don’t know what’s on the other side,” said Jack. “Go slow. Be careful.”

“Okay,” said Annie.

Slowly and carefully, she opened the door.

Then she peeked out.

“Yippee,” she said softly.

Annie stepped into the fading daylight. Jack stepped out after her.

The sun had gone down.

They were standing outside the gate of the Dragon King’s palace. They could see the market not far away. The stalls were closing for the day.

“We’re safe!” said Annie.

Jack breathed a huge sigh of relief.

Just then, a gong sounded. It was coming from the tower of the city walls!

“Oh, man! They’re going to close the gates!” said Jack.

He clutched his sack as they took off. They charged up the street. They ran past the market. They ran past the rich houses … past the poor houses.

Their straw shoes fell off. But Jack and Annie kept running barefoot.

Just as the giant wooden gates started to close, they tore through them.



They charged across the bridge and kept running up the dirt road, past the farmhouse, and through the field.

By the time they reached their tree, Jack’s lungs ached. His heart pounded. His feet burned.

He followed Annie up the rope ladder. When they got inside the tree house, Jack collapsed.

“Let’s—go—home,” he said, out of breath.

He reached for the Pennsylvania book.

“Wait,” said Annie, looking out the window. “They found each other.”

“Who—found—who?” said Jack, panting.

He dragged himself to the window and looked out.

Two figures embraced at the edge of the field.

“The silk weaver and the man who takes care of the cows!” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack.

“Bye!” Annie called to them.

The couple waved back.



Annie sighed happily.

“We can leave now,” she said.

Jack opened the Pennsylvania book and pointed at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

Jack looked out one last time at the Chinese couple. They seemed to be glowing like stars.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. The Ancient Legend

Jack opened his eyes. He was wearing his own clothes and his sneakers. The cloth sack had turned back into his backpack.

“Welcome home, Master Librarians,” said Morgan.

She stood in the tree house, smiling at them.

“Hi!” said Annie.

“We brought you the ancient legend,” said Jack.

“Wonderful!” said Morgan.

Jack reached into his pack. He took out the China book. Then he pulled out the bamboo book. He handed them to Morgan.

“What’s the legend about?” said Annie.

“It’s called The Silk Weaver and the Cowherd,” said Morgan. “It’s a very famous Chinese tale.”

“Guess what, Morgan?” said Annie. “We actually met them! We helped them get together!”

“Oh, did you?” said Morgan.

“Yes!” said Jack. “The silk weaver’s ball of silk saved us!”

“What does the legend say about them?” asked Annie.

“It says that long ago they were heavenly beings who lived in the sky,” said Morgan. “When they came to earth, they fell in love.”

“That’s when we met them!” said Annie.

“Yes, I imagine so,” said Morgan. “The book you brought back tells about their happiness on earth. But I’m afraid a later legend tells us that when they returned to the sky, the king and queen of the skies separated them by a heavenly river called the Milky Way.”

“Oh, no,” said Annie.

“They get back together once a year,” said Morgan. “On that night, birds make a bridge in the sky over the Milky Way.”

Jack and Annie gazed up at the bright summer sky.

“Go home now,” said Morgan. “Come back two weeks from today. Next you’re going to find a book in the country of Ireland, over a thousand years ago.”

“That sounds like fun,” said Annie.

Morgan frowned.

“I’m afraid it was a very dangerous time,” she said. “For Viking raiders often attacked the seacoasts.”

“Vikings?” said Jack. He’d had enough danger to last a long time.

“Don’t worry about it now,” said Morgan. “Just go home and rest.”

Jack nodded.

“I’ll try,” he said, pulling on his backpack.

“Bye,” said Annie. “See you in two weeks.”

“Thank you for your help,” said Morgan.

“Anytime,” said Annie.

They headed down the rope ladder.

From the ground, they waved to Morgan. Then they started for home.

As they got to the edge of the woods, Annie stopped.

“Listen to the crickets,” she said.

Jack listened. The cricket chirps sounded louder than usual.

“Their ancestors lived in the time of the Dragon King,” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

“Right now the grownups are telling the little crickets a legend,” said Annie.

“Yeah, sure,” said Jack.

“A legend passed down from their ancestors,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He didn’t want to admit it, but the cricket noise did sound like storytelling. He could almost hear them saying, Dragon King, Dragon King, Dragon King.

“Jack! Annie!” came a voice.

It was their mother calling them.

The spell was broken. The cricket stories were just plain old cricket sounds again.

“Coming!” Jack shouted.

Jack and Annie ran down their street and across their yard.

“Did you have a good time in China?” their mom asked.

“It was pretty scary,” said Annie.

“We got lost in a tomb,” said Jack. “But we were saved by an ancient book.”

Their mom smiled and shook her head. “My, books are wonderful, aren’t they?” she said.

“Yep!” said Jack and Annie.

And they followed her inside.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





1. Chinese writing has over 50,000 characters. According to legend, the first characters were devised from the tracks of birds and animals.

2. In 221 B.C., China was divided into many kingdoms. Under the leadership of the first emperor, Shi Huangdi (who called himself the Dragon King), China became a united country. Afraid that Chinese scholars were a threat to his power, he ordered all their books burned.

3. Silk thread comes from the cocoon of the silkworm, which feeds on mulberry leaves. The art of making silk was kept a secret because the Chinese once depended on silk for foreign trade.

4. The first emperor built the Great Wall to protect his empire from northern invaders. According to Chinese legend, the wall is a dragon that has turned to stone.

5. Since the 1970s, archaeologists have been investigating the Dragon King’s tomb and have unearthed over 50,000 artifacts.

6. The Chinese legend of the silk weaver and the cowherd is connected with the stars Vega and Altair. The two were married on earth. But when they returned to heaven, they were so happy that they refused to work. The king and queen of Heaven grew angry and separated them by the Milky Way. But once a year, they are together. On the seventh day of the seventh moon, magpies make a bridge between them.

Jack opened his eyes.

A thin gray light came through his window. His clock read 5 A.M. All was quiet.

Today we’re going to ancient Ireland, he thought, back more than a thousand years.

Morgan le Fay had told him that it was a very dangerous time, with Vikings raiding the coasts.

“You awake?” came a whisper.

Annie stood in his doorway. She was dressed and ready to go.

“Yeah, meet you outside,” said Jack as he climbed out of bed.

He pulled on his jeans, T-shirt, and sneakers. He put his secret library card into his backpack with his notebook and pencil. Then he hurried downstairs.

Annie was waiting for him in their yard.

The air was damp and misty.

“Ready?” she asked.

Jack took a deep breath.

“I guess,” he said. He was a little worried about the Vikings.

They walked silently over the dewy grass. Then they ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Mist clung to the trees as they walked through the dark woods.

“It’s hard to see,” said Jack.

“Where’s the tree house?” asked Annie.

“I have no idea,” said Jack.

Just then something fell in front of them.

“Watch out!” shouted Jack. He covered his head.

“The ladder!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

The rope ladder from the magic tree house dangled in front of them.

Jack looked up. The tree house was hidden in the mist.

“Come on, let’s go,” said Annie.

She grabbed the ladder and started up. Jack followed.

They climbed through the wet air and into the tree house.

“Hello,” said Morgan. “I’m glad to see you.”

She was sitting in the corner. At her feet were the scroll they’d brought back from Roman times and the bamboo book from ancient China.

“I’m so glad to see you,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie.

“It’s good that you both came early,” said Morgan.

She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a piece of paper.

“Here’s the ancient story you must find today,” she said.



Morgan handed the paper to Jack. On it were the words:



The mysterious writing reminded Jack of the writing from their trip to the Roman town of Pompeii.

“That looks like Latin,” he said.

“Very good,” said Morgan. “It is Latin.”

“But I thought they spoke Latin in ancient Rome,” said Annie. “Aren’t we going to Ireland?”

“You are,” said Morgan. “But during the Dark Ages in Europe, educated people wrote in Latin.”

“The Dark Ages?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “The time after the fall of the Roman Empire.”

“Why is it called dark?” said Jack.

“It was a difficult time,” said Morgan. “People had to work very hard just to feed and clothe themselves. There was not a lot of time for playing, learning, or making art and music.”

Morgan pulled a book from her robe.

“Your research,” she said, handing it to Annie. The title read: Ireland Long Ago.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But in your darkest hour—”

“Only the ancient story can save us,” Jack and Annie said together.

“And remember this,” said Morgan. “It must be your darkest hour, when there is no hope left. If you ask for help too soon, it will not come.”

“And we have to find the story first,” said Annie.

“That is true,” said Morgan. “Do you have your secret library cards?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Show them to the wisest person you meet,” said Morgan.

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “I think we’re ready now.”

Annie pointed at the cover of the Ireland book.

“I wish we could go there,” she said. She gave Morgan a little wave. “See you soon.”

“Good luck!” said Morgan.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

Imagine a time in Europe over a thousand years ago, when every single book had to be written by hand on animal skins, and writers had to make their ink and paints from plants and minerals. In spite of these hardships, Christian monks in Europe—especially in Ireland—made decorated, or “illuminated” manuscripts, which are some of the most beautiful books the world has ever seen.

Now imagine a warship that can travel far across rough seas, weather terrible storms, and land on rocky coasts. The Vikings of Scandinavia made such ships completely by hand. They were the most elegant sailing vessels of all time.

In the last few years, I’ve seen illuminated manuscripts at the British Museum in London, and Viking warships at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway. Ever since, I have wanted to write about both of these wonders. Finally, this book has given me that opportunity.

I hope you find them as “wonder-full” as I do.





All my best,

For Benjamin Dicker





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In the Magic Tree House Books #8–12, Jack and Annie solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the letters M L on them.

As Master Librarians, Jack and Annie must go on four missions to save stories from ancient libraries. They have already brought back a scroll from an ancient Roman town and a bamboo book from ancient China. Now, they are about to head out on their third mission …



1. Before Dawn

Jack opened his eyes.

A thin gray light came through his window. His clock read 5 A.M. All was quiet.

Today we’re going to ancient Ireland, he thought, back more than a thousand years.

Morgan le Fay had told him that it was a very dangerous time, with Vikings raiding the coasts.

“You awake?” came a whisper.

Annie stood in his doorway. She was dressed and ready to go.

“Yeah, meet you outside,” said Jack as he climbed out of bed.

He pulled on his jeans, T-shirt, and sneakers. He put his secret library card into his backpack with his notebook and pencil. Then he hurried downstairs.

Annie was waiting for him in their yard.

The air was damp and misty.

“Ready?” she asked.

Jack took a deep breath.

“I guess,” he said. He was a little worried about the Vikings.

They walked silently over the dewy grass. Then they ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Mist clung to the trees as they walked through the dark woods.

“It’s hard to see,” said Jack.

“Where’s the tree house?” asked Annie.

“I have no idea,” said Jack.

Just then something fell in front of them.

“Watch out!” shouted Jack. He covered his head.

“The ladder!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

The rope ladder from the magic tree house dangled in front of them.

Jack looked up. The tree house was hidden in the mist.

“Come on, let’s go,” said Annie.

She grabbed the ladder and started up. Jack followed.

They climbed through the wet air and into the tree house.

“Hello,” said Morgan. “I’m glad to see you.”

She was sitting in the corner. At her feet were the scroll they’d brought back from Roman times and the bamboo book from ancient China.

“I’m so glad to see you,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie.

“It’s good that you both came early,” said Morgan.

She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a piece of paper.

“Here’s the ancient story you must find today,” she said.



Morgan handed the paper to Jack. On it were the words:



The mysterious writing reminded Jack of the writing from their trip to the Roman town of Pompeii.

“That looks like Latin,” he said.

“Very good,” said Morgan. “It is Latin.”

“But I thought they spoke Latin in ancient Rome,” said Annie. “Aren’t we going to Ireland?”

“You are,” said Morgan. “But during the Dark Ages in Europe, educated people wrote in Latin.”

“The Dark Ages?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “The time after the fall of the Roman Empire.”

“Why is it called dark?” said Jack.

“It was a difficult time,” said Morgan. “People had to work very hard just to feed and clothe themselves. There was not a lot of time for playing, learning, or making art and music.”

Morgan pulled a book from her robe.

“Your research,” she said, handing it to Annie. The title read: Ireland Long Ago.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But in your darkest hour—”

“Only the ancient story can save us,” Jack and Annie said together.

“And remember this,” said Morgan. “It must be your darkest hour, when there is no hope left. If you ask for help too soon, it will not come.”

“And we have to find the story first,” said Annie.

“That is true,” said Morgan. “Do you have your secret library cards?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Show them to the wisest person you meet,” said Morgan.

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “I think we’re ready now.”

Annie pointed at the cover of the Ireland book.

“I wish we could go there,” she said. She gave Morgan a little wave. “See you soon.”

“Good luck!” said Morgan.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. The Steep Climb

Jack opened his eyes.

The light was still gray, but the air was even damper and colder than in Frog Creek.

“Wow, I’m in a long dress,” said Annie. “It’s scratchy. Hey, I’ve got a little purse on my belt. It has my library card in it!”

Jack looked down at his own clothes.

He was wearing a shirt and trousers, made of heavy wool. He also wore leather slippers. And in place of his backpack was a leather bag.

“Wow,” said Annie, looking out the window. “This really looks like the Dark Ages.”

Jack looked out, too. He couldn’t see anything through the mist.

“It’s just because the sun’s not up yet,” he said. “I’d better check the book.”

Annie handed the Ireland book to Jack. He opened it and read aloud:

The early Middle Ages were once known as the “Dark Ages” because learning and culture nearly vanished throughout Europe. Scholars today praise the brave Irish monks who helped keep Western civilization alive.



“What do ‘civilization’ and ‘monks’ mean?” asked Annie.

“I think civilization is when people have books and art and good manners,” said Jack. “Monks are religious people who spend their time praying and reading and helping people.”

“Well, I don’t see any civilization or monks out there,” said Annie, pointing at the mist.

Jack pulled out his notebook. He wrote:



Then he looked at Annie. “If we find civilization, I think we’ll find the lost story,” he said.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. She lifted her skirt and climbed out the window.

Jack read more in the Ireland book.

The monks copied the ancient writings of the Western world. Before printing was invented, all books had to be written and copied by hand.



“Hey, we’re on a cliff!” Annie called from outside. “Above the ocean!”

“Be careful!” said Jack.

He stuffed the Ireland book and his notebook into his leather bag. Then he climbed out the window.

Annie was peering over the edge. Jack looked, too.

There was a rocky shore twenty feet below. Waves slapped against the rocks. Sea gulls swooped and glided above the sea.

“It doesn’t look like there’s any civilization down there,” said Jack.

“Maybe we should climb those,” said Annie. She pointed to steep steps cut into the cliff.

Jack looked up. The cliff also rose above them in the mist.

“We better wait till the sun comes up,” he said.

“Let’s just go super slow,” said Annie. She started up the stone steps.

“Wait, Annie!” said Jack. “They might be slippery.”

“Whoa!” she said, almost falling backward. “I tripped on my darn dress!”

“I told you to wait,” Jack said. “It’s too dangerous.”

Just then something fell from above.

“Watch it!” said Jack. He put his hands over his head.

“Hey, it’s a rope!” said Annie.

Jack saw a thick rope dangling down the stairs.

“Where’d this come from?” he asked.

“It’s like when Morgan dropped the ladder to us,” said Annie. “I bet someone’s trying to help us.”

“Yeah, but who?” said Jack.

“Let’s find out,” said Annie. She grabbed the rope. “I’ll use it first. Once I’m at the top, you can come after me.”

“Okay, but hurry,” he said. “And be very careful.” Jack waited as Annie started climbing up the steps.



Annie held on to the rope as she climbed slowly up the stairs. Soon she vanished over the top of the cliff.

“What’s up there?” Jack shouted. But his voice was lost in the sound of the waves.

He grabbed the rope and started up the steep steps. At the top of the cliff, he pulled himself over the edge.

“Aha!” boomed a deep, jolly voice. “It’s another little invader!”



3. Brother Patrick

Jack’s glasses were wet with mist. He quickly wiped them, then looked up.

A man in a brown robe stood before him. The man had a round red face. He was bald, except for a fringe of hair around his head.

Nearby the rope was tied around a tree.

“I—I’m not an invader,” said Jack.

“He’s Jack!” said Annie. She was standing behind the man. “I’m Annie. We’re from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

“We—we come in peace,” stammered Jack.

The man’s blue eyes twinkled.

“Oh, do you now?” he said. “I wondered what was going on. I had dropped the rope so I could climb down the steps. But you two grabbed it instead. How in the world did you get on this island?”

Jack stared at the man. He didn’t know how to explain the magic tree house.

“In our boat,” Annie said quickly.

The man looked puzzled. “Not many boats can come ashore at this dark, early hour.”

“Well, we’re very good sailors,” said Annie.

Oh, brother, thought Jack. He hoped their sailing skills wouldn’t be tested.

“Where exactly are we?” asked Annie. “And who exactly are you?”

“You’re on an island off the coast of Ireland,” the man said. “And I am Brother Patrick.”

“Whose brother are you?” said Annie.

The monk smiled. “The ‘brother’ means I’m a Christian monk.”

“Oh, you’re one of the monks who saved civilization!” said Annie.

The man smiled again.

Annie turned to Jack and whispered, “Let’s show him our cards. I trust him.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He trusted the monk, too.

They both pulled out their secret library cards and showed them to Brother Patrick.

The M’s and L’s for Master Librarian shined in the gray light.

The monk looked at them and bowed his head.

“Welcome, my friends,” he said.

“Thank you,” said Jack and Annie.



“I did not truly think you were invaders,” said Brother Patrick. “But on our small island, we are careful of strangers.”

“Why?” said Annie.

“There are terrible stories about Viking raiders,” he said. “When we see their serpent ships, we must hide or be taken as slaves.”

“Serpent ships?” said Jack.

“The prows of their ships are often carved in the shape of a serpent’s head,” said Brother Patrick. “I am afraid it stands for their fierce, cold-blooded ways.”

Jack looked at the misty gray sea.

“Do not worry,” said Brother Patrick. “They cannot land safely on this island before daylight. They’re not as good sailors as some people.” He winked at Annie.

“Too bad for them,” she said cheerfully.

“But tell me, why have you come here?” asked Brother Patrick.

“Oh,” said Jack. “I almost forgot.”

He pulled Morgan’s paper from his leather bag. He showed the Latin words to the monk.



“This is the title of a story that we have to take back to our friend and teacher, Morgan le Fay,” said Annie.

“I see … ” said Brother Patrick. He gave Jack and Annie a mysterious look.

What’s he thinking? Jack wondered.

But the monk changed the subject.

“I think you would like to visit our monastery,” he said.

“What’s that?” said Annie.

“The place where we monks live and work,” said Brother Patrick. “Come.”

“But the sun’s not up yet,” said Jack. “Won’t the others be asleep?”

“Oh, no,” said Brother Patrick. “In the summer, we rise long before daylight. We have much to do. You’ll see.”

The monk led them up a dirt path. Jack hoped their book was at the monastery. He wanted to leave the gloomy island with its threat of Viking invaders as soon as possible.

A low bell started to ring. Jack saw a lonely church steeple against the gray sky ahead.



4. Books of Wonder

The monastery had a stone wall all around it.

Brother Patrick took Jack and Annie through the gate. Beyond the gate was a small church with a hanging bell.

There was also a vegetable garden and six stone huts shaped like giant beehives.

“We grow all our own food,” said Brother Patrick. “Carrots, turnips, spinach, wheat, and beans.”

He led them to the entrance of the first hut. Jack and Annie peeked inside. A monk was pulling flat bread from a low stone oven.

“This is our bakery,” Brother Patrick said.

“It smells good!” said Annie.

“Come along,” Brother Patrick said.

He pointed to each hut as they passed.

“There are our sleeping quarters,” he said. “And that’s where we spin our cloth. In here, we cobble our sandals. There we carve our wooden tools.”

In each of the huts, Jack and Annie could see monks. They were busy spinning or cobbling or carving.

Finally, Brother Patrick came to the largest beehive-like hut.

“I have saved the best for last,” he said. “This is where we do our most important work.”

He stepped inside.

Jack and Annie followed.

The hut was warm and peaceful, yet very alive. It glowed with the golden light of many candles.

Monks sat at wooden tables. Some were reading. Others played chess. Best of all, some were writing and painting in books.

“This is our library,” said Brother Patrick. “Here we study math, history, and poetry. We play chess. And we make books.”

“Jack,” said Annie. “I think this is it.”

“What?” said Jack.

“Civilization!” said Annie.

Brother Patrick laughed.

“Yes, this is where civilization hides,” he said. “On top of our lonely island in the sea.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “I love this place.”

“What kind of books do you make here?” asked Annie.

“Books of wonder,” said Brother Patrick. “We record Christian stories as well as the old myths of Ireland.”

“Myths?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Brother Patrick. “They were gathered from our storytellers—the old women who sing the tales of long ago, when people believed in magic.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Come,” said Brother Patrick, “look at the book of Brother Michael. He has worked on it his whole life.”

Brother Patrick led Jack and Annie over to an old monk. The monk was painting a blue border around one of the pages in a book.

“Michael, these two Master Librarians from faraway would like to see your work,” said Brother Patrick.

The old monk looked up at Jack and Annie. His wrinkled face broke into a smile.

“Welcome,” said Brother Michael in a thin, shaky voice.

“Hi,” said Annie.



Brother Michael showed them the cover of his book. It was decorated with gleaming red and blue jewels.

Then he turned the pages. Each was covered with fancy writing and delicate paintings in green, gold, and blue.

“I wish I could paint like that,” said Annie.

“It’s beautiful,” whispered Jack.

“Thank you,” said Brother Michael.

“How do you make a book like this?” asked Annie.

“I write on sheepskin and use goose quill pens,” said Brother Michael. “My paints are made of earth and plants.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Show Michael what you are seeking,” Brother Patrick said.

“Oh, right!” said Jack. He pulled out the paper Morgan had given them. He showed the Latin writing to the old monk.

Brother Michael nodded.

“Yes,” he said with a smile. “I know that one quite well.”

Brother Michael turned to the page he had been painting with a blue border. He pointed to the writing at the top of the page.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

The words were:



5. Warships on the Waves

“We found our story!” said Jack.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Brother Patrick. “But alas, Brother Michael has not yet completed his work. You will have to return for it.”

“Oh, shoot,” said Annie.

Jack was disappointed, too.

“I don’t know if we’ll be able to come back,” he said.

“I don’t know if we can even leave without the story,” said Annie.

Brother Patrick looked puzzled.

The two kids looked at each other, then back at Brother Patrick. It was too hard to explain about the tree house and how the magic worked.

Jack shrugged.

“We’ll just have to try,” he said.

Outside, the church bell began ringing.

“It is time now for our sunrise prayers,” said Brother Patrick. “Will you join us?”

“Thanks, but we better try to go home now,” said Jack.

Brother Patrick nodded and led them into the garden. When he opened the gate, they stopped.

The horizon glowed pink and purple. The sun had started to rise.

No one spoke as the great, fiery ball rose slowly over the ocean.

Finally, Brother Patrick broke the silence. “Shine, O light of the sun,” he said softly, “on this day filled with wonder.”

“That’s beautiful,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He agreed.

Brother Patrick turned to them. “It is such sights as this that inspire our bookmaking,” he said. “Now go, and may God be with you on your voyage home.”

“Thanks,” said Jack and Annie.

“Do you need me to guide you to your boat?” he asked.

“I don’t think so,” said Jack.

“Follow the path to the top of the cliff,” said Brother Patrick. “Then use my rope to help you down the steps.”

“Okay,” said Annie. “Bye!” And she went through the gate.

Jack wanted to go home, but he hated leaving the monastery. It was filled with people doing his favorite things: reading and learning.

“I really like it here,” he said to Brother Patrick.

“I’m glad. But you must go now, while the weather is with you,” said the monk. “Everything can change in an instant.”

Then Brother Patrick turned and went into the church.

Jack hurried out the gate. Before he went further, he stopped and pulled out his notebook.

He quickly made two lists:



“Come on!” Annie called from the top of the steps.

“Coming,” Jack called.

He put away his notebook and ran along the dirt path to the edge of the cliff.

Overhead, flocks of gulls circled in the purple sky. Their cries sounded like screams.

“What’s wrong with them?” Jack said.

“Maybe they always do this at sunrise,” said Annie. “Let me go first.”

Clutching the rope, she started down the steps.

Jack grabbed the rope and started down. The birds’ cries went on. They worried him. They sounded like warnings.

Jack reached the rocky ledge and let go of the rope.

“Let’s go!” Annie called from the tree house.

Jack looked at the horizon one last time.

His heart nearly stopped. A ship was outlined against the sky! Behind it, he saw two smaller ships.

As the ships came into view, their bright sails were filled with wind and their serpent prows blazed in the new sunlight.

“Oh, no,” Jack whispered. “Vikings!”



6. The Vikings Are Coming!

“Annie!” Jack cried. “Vikings!”

Annie looked out the tree house window. “Vikings?”

“They’re headed straight for the island!” said Jack.

He turned back to the stone steps.

“Where are you going?” cried Annie.

“To warn the monks!” Jack said.

“I’ll come, too!” cried Annie. She scrambled out of the tree house.



“Hurry!” said Jack.

Jack didn’t even use the rope. He pulled himself up the steep steps with his hands.

As Jack and Annie climbed up the face of the cliff, clouds began to cover the sun. When they reached the top, a fog had almost hidden the serpent ships.

“Run!” cried Annie.

The fog blanketed the whole island. Jack and Annie could barely see the path to the monastery.

When they arrived at the gate, the misty white world was silent.

“Vikings!” Jack cried. “Vikings!”

“The monks are still in church!” said Annie. She yanked the bell rope.

Dong! Dong!

Jack and Annie watched as Brother Patrick and the other monks ran out of the church.

“The Vikings are coming!” Jack shouted.

Brother Patrick’s rosy face turned white.

“Make haste!” he said to the other monks. “Gather the books and hide.”

The monks ran into the library. Brother Patrick turned to Jack and Annie.

“We have a secret hiding place, a cave on the other side of the island,” he said. “You can come with us. But I am not certain you will be safe.”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “We’re going to try to go home.”

“Do not use the steps,” Brother Patrick said. “The Vikings will climb them.”

“Then how do we get down?” said Jack.

“Go that way,” said Brother Patrick, pointing. “At the cliff’s edge are two large rocks. A path between those rocks will take you down to the shore. Then you can walk around to your boat.”

“Thanks!” said Annie.

“Be careful!” said Brother Patrick. He hurried inside the library.

“Wait!” came a thin voice as Jack and Annie turned to run.

It was Brother Michael. He hobbled over to them, holding out his book of Irish tales.

“Take it,” he said.

“Are you sure?” Jack asked. He knew it was Brother Michael’s life’s work.

“Please,” said Brother Michael. “It is better that the world should have some of it than none at all. Just in case … ”

“We’ll take good care of it,” said Jack. He gently placed the jeweled book in his leather bag.



“Good luck!” said Annie.

Annie and Jack waved good-bye to the old man. Then they raced to the rocks that Brother Patrick had told them about.



7. Fogbound

At the rocks, the sea gulls still screeched. Jack could barely see the steep path leading down into the fog.

“Go slowly,” Jack whispered to Annie as they started down.

“Whoops!” said Annie. She slipped and fell forward, bumping into Jack. “My foot got caught in my stupid dress—”

“Shh!” said Jack.

He held on to Annie. They listened as pebbles and rocks rolled down the cliff.

Jack took a deep breath.

“We’ve got to watch out for Vikings, too,” he whispered.

They started down the steep path again. They went one step at a time. The sound of the waves against the rocks grew louder.

Finally, they stepped down onto a flat strip of pebbles.

“Where are we?” whispered Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Oh, look!” said Annie. She pointed to the shoreline.

Through the fog rose the serpent prows of the Viking ships!

Jack and Annie crept closer to the ships. Their sails were down. Each ship had been tied to a tall jagged rock. They seemed deserted as they bobbed in the shallow waves.

Jack really wanted to check out the ships. But he was afraid of wasting time.

“We’d better find the tree house,” he said to Annie.

They crept away from the three Viking ships.

Suddenly, they both froze.

Through the mist, they saw a group of Viking warriors. The Vikings were looking at the top of the cliff.

Their long yellow hair hung down from beneath their iron helmets. They carried round wooden shields and swords and axes.



“It looks like they’re planning to climb the cliff,” whispered Annie.

“We need to hide until they go,” whispered Jack. “Then we can look for the tree house.”

“Let’s hide in a ship!” said Annie.

“Good idea,” said Jack.

They crept back to where the ships were tied.

Jack was happy to see that the sides of the smallest ship were very low. They would easily be able to climb over them.

“You go first,” said Annie.

Jack waded through the shallow water. It was cold!

He reached the ship and grabbed one side. He pushed himself up and onto the ship’s deck.

The ship jerked forward. Jack looked at the shore. It was now thirty feet away. The ship’s anchoring rope was pulled tight. The serpent prow bobbed up and down with the waves.

The fog and the movement of the ship made Jack feel as if he was in a dream. For a moment, he forgot to be scared of the Vikings.

“This is so cool,” he called. “Come on, Annie!”

Annie started to wade out to the ship. Suddenly, she disappeared.

“Annie?” called Jack.

Her head popped out of the water. She splashed with her arms.

“It—it’s deep!” she gasped. “My dress—too heavy!”

“Use the rope!” called Jack. “Like when we climbed the stairs!”

Annie grabbed the rope that stretched from ship to shore. It held her weight as she began inching along it.

“Hold on tight!” cried Jack.

“I—I am!” gasped Annie.

She kept going, hand over hand, along the rope, toward the ship.

When Annie got close to the ship, Jack reached out to help her. As he pulled her in, the side of the ship dipped down.

Then the rope went slack, and the Viking ship slid out to sea.



8. Lost at Sea

Annie fell to the deck of the ship.

Jack pulled the rope out of the water. The end of it was still tied in a loop.

“What happened?” asked Annie.

“We’re heading out to sea,” said Jack. “I guess all the pulling lifted the rope off the rock.”

Annie sat up and looked at the misty whiteness.

“I can’t see the island,” she said.

“I can’t see anything,” said Jack.

Annie looked at Jack.

“Do you think this is our darkest hour?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book will help.”



He pulled out their research book. He found a picture of a Viking ship. He read the caption aloud:

Viking warships were the best ships of their times. When there was no wind, the crew would take down the sails and row with oars. The smallest ships had four rowers, and the largest had as many as thirty-two. Rowers sat on boxes that stored their belongings.



“Great,” said Annie, jumping up. “This isn’t our darkest hour!”

“Why do you say that?” asked Jack.

“There’s still hope,” said Annie. “We can row to the other side of the island and find the tree house.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack.

“Please, Jack,” said Annie. “Can we just try?”

She grabbed one of the oars. She could barely lift it.

“Forget it, Annie,” said Jack. “It takes four big Viking guys to row this thing. You’re too little. I’m too little.”

“Come on, Jack. Just try,” said Annie. “You get an oar, too. We’ll sit on boxes across from each other.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

Annie dragged her long oar over to a storage box.

“I’m not doing this alone,” she said.

Jack groaned. Then he dragged an oar to the box across from Annie.

“Cool!” said Annie. She peered into a storage box. “Look, one for each of us!”

She lifted out two small Viking helmets.

“Maybe these were made for Viking kids who sometimes ride in this ship,” said Annie.

“Maybe,” said Jack.

He hadn’t thought of Vikings as real people before—people with families and little kids.

Annie pulled off her scarf and put a helmet on her head.

“Now I feel like a Viking, too,” she said. “I bet it will help me row.”

She handed Jack a helmet. He put it on. It made him feel a little different.

“I don’t know about this,” he said. The helmet wasn’t as heavy as the one he had worn in the time of castles. But it was still pretty heavy.

“Well, I’m braver with mine on,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He didn’t know how Annie could be braver than she already was.

“Ready to row?” she asked.

“Yup,” said Jack. He was feeling braver himself.

The wind picked up as Jack lifted his heavy oar over the side of the ship.

He lowered it into the water. But the current was so strong that the oar was ripped from his hands.

Jack fell over backward as his oar slipped into the sea.

“I lost my oar!” Annie yelled.

Jack looked up as rain started to fall. The sky was black. A gush of seawater poured over the side of the ship!

“Brrr!” said Annie as she tried to stand.

The black sky shook with thunder and flashed with lightning.

Jack crawled to the side of the ship and pulled himself up.

Another huge wave was coming right toward them!

“It’s our darkest hour now!” cried Annie. “Get Brother Michael’s book!”

Jack reached into his leather bag. He pulled out the jeweled book and held it up.

“Save us, story!” he cried.

He looked at the sea again. What he saw made him scream.

Rising from the oncoming wave was a giant sea serpent!



9. Sea Monster!

The serpent’s head rose higher and higher above the water.

Jack couldn’t move.

“He’s beautiful!” said Annie.

“Beautiful?” cried Jack.

The serpent’s neck was as tall as a two-story building. Its green scales were covered with sea slime.

“Go away!” shouted Jack.

“No—stay! Help us!” shouted Annie.

The great serpent glided closer to the ship.

Jack ducked.

“Come on!” said Annie. “You can do it! Get us to shore before the ship sinks!”

Jack closed his eyes. He felt the ship jerk, then move forward.

He looked up. They were gliding over the giant waves.

Jack turned. The great serpent was pressing its long neck against the back of the ship, pushing it toward the shore.

As the serpent pushed them, the wind grew calmer. The clouds lifted and the water glittered with sunlight.

The rocky shore grew closer. Jack could see the tree house on the ledge above it.

“Hurry!” Annie called to the serpent monster.

The great serpent gave the ship one last push. The ship swooshed onto a sand bar near the shore.



Jack put the jeweled book carefully back into his bag. Then he and Annie climbed out of the ship onto the wet sand. They looked back at the sea.

The great serpent was rearing its long neck into the air. Its scales glittered pink and green in the sunlight.

“Bye!” shouted Annie. “Thanks a lot!”

The monster seemed to nod at her. Then he dove into the sea and was gone.

Jack and Annie headed toward the rocks. All of a sudden, Annie gasped.

“Uh-oh,” she said, pointing to the top of the cliff.

Two Vikings were staring down at them!

“To the tree house!” cried Jack.

The Vikings shouted and started down the steep stairs.

Jack and Annie began scrambling up the rocks.

They reached the tree house and climbed inside.

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book.

Annie stuck her head out the window.

“Go home! Stop causing trouble!” she yelled to the Vikings, who were almost to the ledge.

Jack pointed at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.



“IWISHWECOULDGOTHERE!” Jack shouted.

Just as the Vikings reached the ledge, the wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. Sunrise

“Boy, I’m glad to be back in my jeans,” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. He still felt damp. But he was glad to be wearing his jeans again, too.

“Welcome home,” said Morgan. She was standing in the shadows. “Are you all right?”

“Of course!” piped Annie.

“And we brought back the lost book,” said Jack.

He reached in his backpack and took out the jeweled book of Brother Michael. He handed it to Morgan.

The enchantress sighed. She ran her hand over the sparkling cover.

“A great work of art,” she said.

Morgan then put the book next to the scroll from Roman times and the bamboo book from ancient China.

“I’m afraid the story you wanted is not all there,” said Jack. “Brother Michael didn’t get the chance to finish it.”

Morgan nodded.

“I know,” she said. “Sadly, we have only bits and pieces of many wonderful old stories.”

“What’s the story about?” asked Annie.

“It’s an ancient Irish tale about a great serpent named Sarph,” said Morgan.

“He saved us by pushing our ship over the stormy waves!” Annie said.

“Sarph was a huge, ugly monster,” said Jack.

Morgan smiled.

“Sometimes monsters can be heroes,” she said.

“What about Vikings?” asked Jack.

“Oh, most definitely, Vikings could be heroes, too,” she said. “In fact, once the Vikings settled down, they became more than just a warrior people. They actually added a lot to civilization.”

“We found civilization on our trip,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “in the library of the monastery.”

Morgan smiled again.

“Their library was a light in the Dark Ages, wasn’t it?” she said.

Jack nodded. He thought of Brother Michael and the other monks making their beautiful books by candlelight.

“Thank you also for your great courage,” Morgan said. “You are both heroes, too.”

Jack smiled shyly.

“Go home now and rest,” said Morgan.

“Bye,” Jack and Annie said together.

They started down the tree house ladder. The sky was turning pink and gold.

When they reached the ground, Morgan called out to them, “Come back in two weeks. I need you to find one more lost book.”

“Where is it?” said Jack.

“Ancient Greece,” said Morgan. “A place with the highest civilization—and the first Olympic games.”

“Oh, wow!” said Annie.

Jack was thrilled. He had always wanted to go to ancient Greece.

Jack and Annie took off through the woods.

The sun was rising when they got to their front porch.

Annie opened the front door. She stuck her head inside and listened.

“Everything’s quiet,” she whispered. “I think Mom and Dad are still sleeping.”

She moved quietly inside.

Jack turned back to watch the red sun rise through a clear blue sky.

He thought about how it was the same sun that had risen in Ireland—over a thousand years ago.

“Shine, O light of the sun,” Jack whispered, “on this day filled with wonder.”

Then he slipped inside his quiet house.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





1) In the fifth century, St. Patrick converted Ireland to Christianity. Scholars and craftsmen from all over Europe studied with the Irish monks in their monasteries.


2) Monks in the monasteries made beautiful manuscripts to reflect the glory of God. Most of their manuscripts were religious in nature.


3) The first recorded people of Ireland were the Celts. Before the Irish became Christians, they practiced the Celtic religion and developed a Celtic mythology.


4) The great sea serpent Sarph was a Celtic creature who was identified with the Milky Way. Just as Jack and Annie were not able to rescue the complete story of Sarph, today we have only fragments of many old Celtic stories.


5) The word Vikings means “fighting men.” Vikings included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes.


6) In the ninth century, Viking raiders attacked the coastal villages of England, Scotland, and Ireland, stealing treasure and carrying people off to be slaves.


7) The Vikings were the greatest shipbuilders of their time. The shallowness of their warships allowed them to land on most beaches.


8) The Vikings were “settling men” as well as “fighting men.” Eventually they settled down in Europe and became traders, exchanging goods rather than stealing them. They were also expert craftsmen.

“You awake?” Annie’s voice came out of the dark.

“Yep,” said Jack from his bed.

“Get up,” said Annie. “We have to get to the tree house before sunrise.”

“I’m ready,” said Jack.

He threw back his covers and jumped out of bed. He was wearing his jeans and T-shirt.

“You slept in your clothes?” asked Annie.

“I didn’t want to waste any time,” said Jack. He pulled on his backpack.

Annie laughed.

“You must really be excited about going to ancient Greece,” she said.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“Do you have your secret library card?” asked Annie.

“Yeah, do you?” said Jack.

“Sure. Put it in your backpack,” she said. She handed her card to him. “I’ll carry the flashlight.”

“All set,” said Jack.

They tiptoed downstairs and out the door.

Outside the air was fresh and cool.

“There’s no moon,” said Annie. “Just stars.”

She turned on her flashlight.

“Ta-da!” she said. “Let’s go.”

They followed the beam of light across their yard and up the street.

Jack was thrilled to be going to ancient Greece. But something worried him.

“What do you think will happen after we go to Greece?” he asked Annie. “Is this our last mission ever?”

“Oh, I hope not,” said Annie. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know. Let’s ask Morgan,” said Jack.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

They started running. The flashlight beam flew in front of them, lighting the way.

They slowed to a walk when they got to the Frog Creek woods. The thick woods were pitch-black.

Annie shined the flashlight upward as they walked between the trees. Finally, they found the magic tree house.

“We’re here!” Annie called.

“Go on up,” said Jack.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Annie shined the flashlight around the tree house.

Morgan le Fay was sitting at the window. She covered her eyes when the light hit her face.

“Turn off the light, please, Annie,” she said softly.

Annie turned it off.

“Welcome,” Morgan said in the dark. “Are you ready for your next mission?”

“Yes!” said Annie. Then her voice got quiet. “This isn’t our last one ever, is it?”

“Ask me that question after this mission,” said Morgan.

“We want to go on more,” said Jack.

“You’re very brave to say that,” said Morgan. “You’ve had three very hard journeys as Master Librarians.”

“Oh, they weren’t so hard,” said Jack.

“You risked your life to save the lost story of Hercules,” said Morgan.

“It was nothing,” said Annie.

“And the Chinese story of the silk weaver,” said Morgan. “And the Irish story of the serpent monster Sarph. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack and Annie.

“Now,” said Morgan, “for the last story … ”

Jack heard a rustling sound.

“Here is the title,” Morgan said. “You can shine your light on it, Annie.”

Annie turned the flashlight back on. She shined it on the paper.



“Wow, is that Greek?” asked Jack.

“It certainly is,” said Morgan.

She reached into her robe again and pulled out a book.

“For your research,” she said.

Jack took the book from her. Annie shined her flashlight on the cover. They read the title: A Day in Ancient Greece.

“Now, what must you always remember?” asked Morgan.

“Our research book will guide us,” said Jack.

“But in our darkest hour, only the lost story can save us,” said Annie.

Morgan nodded. “And you must show your secret library cards to the wisest person you meet,” she said.

“Don’t worry. We will. Bye!” said Annie.

Jack shivered with excitement as he pointed at the book’s cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

“And I wish we could go on lots of other missions!” Annie added.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.

Dear Readers,

Hour of the Olympics was a joy for me to write, mostly because Jack and Annie meet my favorite creature of Greek mythology.

I’ve been very interested in Greek myths for many years. In fact, I’ve written a number of different books retelling them, including several picture books.

My hope is that Hour of the Olympics will help spark your interest in Greek mythology. Though these stories were first told over three thousand years ago, they are still some of the most vibrant, exciting tales we have today. When we read them, it’s as if we’re listening to the ancient Greek storytellers across the centuries. Now that’s real time travel, don’t you think?





All my best,

To Chase Goddard,

who loves to read



One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In the Magic Tree House Books #8–12, Jack and Annie solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the letters M L on them.

Jack and Annie’s first four missions are to save stories from ancient libraries. This is their fourth mission …



1. Just One More

“You awake?” Annie’s voice came out of the dark.

“Yep,” said Jack from his bed.

“Get up,” said Annie. “We have to get to the tree house before sunrise.”

“I’m ready,” said Jack.

He threw back his covers and jumped out of bed. He was wearing his jeans and T-shirt.

“You slept in your clothes?” asked Annie.

“I didn’t want to waste any time,” said Jack. He pulled on his backpack.

Annie laughed.

“You must really be excited about going to ancient Greece,” she said.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“Do you have your secret library card?” asked Annie.

“Yeah, do you?” said Jack.

“Sure. Put it in your backpack,” she said. She handed her card to him. “I’ll carry the flashlight.”

“All set,” said Jack.

They tiptoed downstairs and out the door.

Outside the air was fresh and cool.

“There’s no moon,” said Annie. “Just stars.”

She turned on her flashlight.

“Ta-da!” she said. “Let’s go.”

They followed the beam of light across their yard and up the street.

Jack was thrilled to be going to ancient Greece. But something worried him.

“What do you think will happen after we go to Greece?” he asked Annie. “Is this our last mission ever?”

“Oh, I hope not,” said Annie. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know. Let’s ask Morgan,” said Jack.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

They started running. The flashlight beam flew in front of them, lighting the way.

They slowed to a walk when they got to the Frog Creek woods. The thick woods were pitch-black.

Annie shined the flashlight upward as they walked between the trees. Finally, they found the magic tree house.

“We’re here!” Annie called.

“Go on up,” said Jack.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Annie shined the flashlight around the tree house.

Morgan le Fay was sitting at the window. She covered her eyes when the light hit her face.

“Turn off the light, please, Annie,” she said softly.

Annie turned it off.

“Welcome,” Morgan said in the dark. “Are you ready for your next mission?”

“Yes!” said Annie. Then her voice got quiet. “This isn’t our last one ever, is it?”

“Ask me that question after this mission,” said Morgan.

“We want to go on more,” said Jack.

“You’re very brave to say that,” said Morgan. “You’ve had three very hard journeys as Master Librarians.”

“Oh, they weren’t so hard,” said Jack.

“You risked your life to save the lost story of Hercules,” said Morgan.

“It was nothing,” said Annie.

“And the Chinese story of the silk weaver,” said Morgan. “And the Irish story of the serpent monster Sarph. Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack and Annie.

“Now,” said Morgan, “for the last story … ”

Jack heard a rustling sound.

“Here is the title,” Morgan said. “You can shine your light on it, Annie.”

Annie turned the flashlight back on. She shined it on the paper.



“Wow, is that Greek?” asked Jack.

“It certainly is,” said Morgan.

She reached into her robe again and pulled out a book.

“For your research,” she said.

Jack took the book from her. Annie shined her flashlight on the cover. They read the title: A Day in Ancient Greece.

“Now, what must you always remember?” asked Morgan.

“Our research book will guide us,” said Jack.

“But in our darkest hour, only the lost story can save us,” said Annie.

Morgan nodded. “And you must show your secret library cards to the wisest person you meet,” she said.

“Don’t worry. We will. Bye!” said Annie.

Jack shivered with excitement as he pointed at the book’s cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

“And I wish we could go on lots of other missions!” Annie added.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.



2. Any Girls Here?

Jack opened his eyes. Warm sunshine streamed into the tree house.

“We sure don’t need the flashlight here,” he said.

“Look, Morgan gave us clothes like the ones we wore in Pompeii,” said Annie.

Jack looked down.

His clothes were similar to the ones he’d worn in the Roman town of Pompeii: a tunic and sandals. He also had a leather bag in place of his backpack again.

Annie looked out the window.

“And we landed in an olive tree—just like Pompeii!” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. He caught his breath.

“Are we in the wrong place?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Look past the trees. Doesn’t it look like a big fair?”

Jack looked. Annie was right. Past the olive grove was a field filled with white tents. Beyond the field were red-brick buildings with columns and huge crowds of people.

“What’s going on?” Jack asked.

He pulled the research book out of his leather bag. He found a picture of the scene outside. Below the picture were these words:

The Olympic Games began in ancient Greece over 2,500 years ago. Every four years, more than 40,000 people traveled to Olympia, the town where the festival of athletic games took place.



“Oh, man,” Jack whispered. “We’re at the ancient Olympics!”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Jack wrote in his notebook:



“Come on, let’s go watch!” Annie said. She started down the rope ladder.

Jack threw his notebook and the research book into his leather bag.

“Don’t forget we have to get Morgan’s story, too,” he said as he followed Annie.

Annie waited as Jack stepped to the ground. Then they walked through the olive grove to where the tents were.

Jack heard pipe music and smelled food roasting over fires. Groups of men talked excitedly to one another.

“That’s funny,” said Annie. “I don’t see any girls here.”

“Oh, sure, there’re girls,” said Jack.

“Where?” said Annie. “Show me.”

Jack looked around. But he only saw men and boys—no women or girls at all.

Then he saw an outdoor theater. A woman was standing on the stage. She had yellow hair and a purple tunic.

“There,” said Jack, pointing.

“What’s she doing?” asked Annie.

A soldier was on the stage with her. He wore a long cape. A helmet with a red crest hid his face.

The woman and the soldier were waving their arms and talking loudly to each other.



“I think they’re doing a play,” said Jack. “I’ll look.”

He pulled out the Greek book and found a picture of the theater.

“Listen,” he said. He read aloud:

The Greeks were the first to write plays. Many English words for the theater come from Greek words, such as drama, scenery, and chorus. Many Greek plays are still performed today.



“Hey, Jack,” said Annie. “You’re wrong.”

When Jack looked up, he saw the woman had pulled off her wig. It was a boy dressed up as a woman!

“See, even she’s a boy,” said Annie. “That’s weird.”

“Hmm,” said Jack. He went on reading:

A few actors would play many different parts in the same play. Women were not allowed to act, so men played the female roles, too.



“That’s not fair,” said Annie. “What if a woman wanted to be in a play?”

“Don’t worry about it,” said Jack. He put the book away. “Let’s just take a peek at the Olympics, then find our story.”

He nudged Annie to move along.

Just then he heard a voice.

“Wait!”

They turned around. A man with a short white beard was walking toward them.

“Hello,” said the man. He was looking right at Annie. “Who are you?”

“Who are you?” Annie asked boldly.



3. The Secret Poet

The bearded man smiled at Annie.

“My name is Plato,” he said.

“Plato?” said Jack. That name sounded familiar.

“You may have heard of me,” the man said. “I am a philosopher.”

“What’s that mean?” said Annie.

“A lover of wisdom,” said Plato.

“Wow,” said Annie.

Plato smiled at her.

“It’s odd to see a girl walking so bravely through Olympia,” he said. “You must be from far away.”

“We’re Jack and Annie,” said Annie. “And we come from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania. It’s very far away.”

Plato looked puzzled.

Annie turned to Jack.

“I think we should show him our cards,” she said in a low voice. “He’s a lover of wisdom.”

Jack nodded. He reached into his bag and took out the secret library cards. He showed them to Plato.

The letters M and L that stood for Master Librarian glittered on the cards.

“Amazing!” said Plato. “I’ve never met such young Master Librarians. Why have you come to Olympia?”

Jack pulled out the piece of paper with the title of the story.

“We’re looking for this story,” he said.



“Oh, yes,” said Plato softly. “This was written by a brilliant poet—a friend of mine, in fact.”

“Do you know where the poet lives?” asked Jack.

“Very near here,” said Plato.

“Will you take us there?” asked Annie.

“Yes, but I must warn you—never tell anyone who the poet is,” said Plato. “It’s a secret.”

“We won’t,” whispered Annie.

Plato led them away from the outdoor theater.



They started down a dirt road. It was crowded with people heading to the games.

Plato stopped at the door of a sand-colored house with a brick roof.

He opened the door and led Jack and Annie into an empty courtyard.

“Wait here,” he said. He disappeared through a doorway.

Jack and Annie looked around.

Rooms opened onto the sunny courtyard. Everything was quiet.

“The people who live here must have gone to the games,” said Annie.

“I bet you’re right,” said Jack.

He pulled out the Greek book and found a picture of a house. He read aloud:

Men and women lived in separate parts of a Greek house. Women spent most of their time spinning and weaving and taking care of the kitchen. Boys were sent away to school when they were seven. Girls were not allowed to go to school.



“Girls can’t go to school?” said Annie. “How do they learn to read and write?”

At that moment Plato returned. With him was a young woman dressed in a long tunic with a colored border. She was holding a scroll.

Annie smiled a big smile.

“Finally,” she said. “Another girl.”

“Jack and Annie, meet our secret poet,” said Plato.



4. Not Fair!

The young woman smiled at Jack and Annie.

“How did you learn to read and write?” Annie asked.

“I taught myself,” the woman answered.

“She wrote a poem and brought it to me,” said Plato, “because I have written and told people that I think Greek girls should go to school and learn things.”

“Is that the poem?” said Jack. He pointed to the poet’s scroll.



“Yes,” said the young woman.

“It’s a wonderful story,” said Plato. “But she will get in trouble if it is read in our land. You must take it back to your faraway home, where it will be safe.”

The poet handed Jack her scroll. He put it into his bag.

“Tell us your name,” said Annie. “So we can tell people who wrote the story.”

The young woman shook her head.

“I cannot,” she said. When she saw Annie’s sad face, she added, “You can tell people it was written by Anonymous.”

“That’s your name?” asked Annie.

“No, anonymous means that no one knows who wrote it,” said Plato.

“But that’s not true!” said Annie.

“I’m afraid the risk is too great,” said Plato.

Annie looked back at the woman.

“I’m sorry,” said Annie. “It’s not fair—not at all.”

The poet smiled at her. “I am happy that you will take my story to your country,” she said. “Perhaps someday women everywhere will write books just like men.”

“They will,” said Jack. “I promise.”

The young woman looked at him, puzzled.

“It’s true!” said Annie.

“Thank you, Annie,” the young woman said. “And thank you, Jack.” She bowed, then hurried out of the courtyard.

“Wait!” said Annie.

She started to go after the poet, but Plato stopped her.

“Come along,” he said. “The games will start soon.”

Plato then led Jack and Annie out of the Greek house back onto the dirt road.

“Girls can’t write stories,” grumbled Annie. “They can’t go to school. They can’t be in plays. I’ve had enough of ancient Greece. Let’s get out of here.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “What about the Olympics?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Annie. Her eyes got brighter. “I almost forgot.”

“Well,” said Plato slowly. “I would like to take you both to the games. I have special seats in the viewing box. However … ” He looked at Annie.

“Don’t tell me,” she said. “Girls can’t go to the Olympics either.”

Plato shook his head.

“A girl will get in terrible trouble if she goes to the games,” he said.

Annie sighed. “It’s really, really not fair,” she said.

“I’m sorry,” said Plato. “My country is a democracy. We believe in freedom for our citizens. But I’m afraid right now that only means men.”

“Annie’s right. It’s not fair,” said Jack. “I think we should go home now.”

“No, Jack. You go to the Olympics,” said Annie. “At least you can tell me about it. Take notes.”

“What about you?” Jack said.

“I’ll go back to that play at the outdoor theater,” Annie said. “Meet me there when you’re done.”

Jack didn’t want to leave Annie alone. But he also didn’t want to miss the Olympics.

“Go! Have fun!” Annie said. She began walking away. “I’ll see you later! Bye, Plato!”

“Bye, Annie,” said Plato.

Annie turned back again and waved.

“I’ll tell you all about it!” Jack called.

“This way,” said Plato.

He and Jack turned and joined the crowd heading toward the Olympic grounds.



5. Hi, Zeus

“This is the very first day of the games,” Plato told Jack, “the day of the chariot races.”

“Oh, wow,” whispered Jack.

He couldn’t believe he was going to see a chariot race. The modern Olympic Games didn’t have chariot races.

They walked toward the race track. Plato pointed to a large building near the road.

“That is the gymnasium,” he said. “It is where our athletes train. They practice running and throwing the javelin and discus.”

“We have a gymnasium at our school in Frog Creek,” said Jack. “We call it a gym.”

“People all over the world copy us Greeks,” Plato said.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I have to take notes for Annie.”

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“Okay, we can go,” said Jack. He tucked his notebook under his arm.

As they moved along, Plato pointed to a beautiful tree nearby.

“The olive tree is our sacred tree,” he said. “The winners of the games will wear crowns made from its branches.”

“Oh, wow,” said Jack. And he wrote:



Next they passed a beautiful statue of a winged lady.

“Who’s that?” said Jack.

“She’s Nike, the goddess of victory,” said Plato.

Jack quickly wrote:



“Nike is important to the games,” said Plato. “But the most important Olympic god is in there.”

He took Jack to a brick building with huge columns. They stepped through the door. It was a temple. Jack gasped.

In front of them loomed the biggest statue he had ever seen.

The statue was at least two stories high. It was a bearded man sitting on a throne.

“This is the temple of Zeus. And that is a statue of Zeus himself,” said Plato. “The Olympic Games are played in his honor. He is the chief god of the Greek gods and goddesses.”



“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

“Yesterday all the athletes came here,” said Plato. “They swore to Zeus that they had trained for ten months. And they promised to obey the rules of the games.”

The statue of the mighty Greek god stared down at Jack.

Jack felt very small.

“Hi, Zeus,” he said. His voice was small, too.

Suddenly, trumpet sounds came from outside.

“The hour has come,” said Plato. “We must hurry. The Olympic parade begins!”



6. Mystery Man

Plato and Jack hurried past the crowds standing at the sides of the race track. Everyone was shouting and cheering.

“I have seats next to the judges,” said Plato. He pointed to a tall stand with rows of benches.

Plato led Jack through the crowd and up the steps to their seats.

“Wow, thanks,” said Jack.

He had a great view.

The Olympic parade had already started. Musicians playing pipes were at the front. Behind them marched the Olympic athletes—the best in all of Greece.

Jack sighed as he watched the parade going around the track. Annie would really love this, he thought.

“The athletes in front are the runners,” said Plato. “Foot races are the oldest event of the Olympics.”

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“Behind the runners are the boxers,” said Plato. “They’re wearing special gloves and bronze helmets.”

Jack wrote:



“Behind them are the wrestlers,” said Plato.

And Jack wrote:



When Jack looked up again, he saw a soldier staring up at him from the sidelines.

The soldier was dressed like the actor from the outdoor theater. He had on a long cape and a red-crested helmet that covered most of his face.

But something was strange. This soldier was short—really short.

“Here come the discus and javelin throwers,” said Plato, “and then the men in armor.”

“What do they do?” asked Jack.

“They race wearing full armor,” said Plato.



Jack smiled to himself. He knew Annie would think that was funny.

He wrote in his notebook:



Jack finished writing.

He looked back at the short soldier.

“In a moment, the chariot races will begin,” said Plato. “Winning a chariot race is the greatest honor of the games.”

Jack just nodded. He was still studying the short soldier, who seemed to be looking back at him.

Suddenly, a small hand came out from the soldier’s cape. The hand gave a little wave.

Jack gasped. It was Annie’s hand waving!

The short soldier was Annie.



7. Go! Go! Go!

Jack stared in horror at Annie. She must have borrowed a costume from the theater!

He remembered Plato’s words: A girl will get in terrible trouble if she tries to attend the Olympic Games.

Jack shook his head at her and pointed his finger, as if to say, Get out of here!

But Annie just waved at him again.

Jack kept shaking his head at Annie. He even shook his fist.

Annie turned back to watch the race.

“It’s not a joke!” Jack shouted.

Plato turned and looked at him.

“Of course not,” said Plato. “We take the games very seriously.”

Jack felt his face grow hot. He glared at Annie’s back.

Just then the trumpet sounded.

“The chariots are taking their places,” said Plato.

Jack saw the dozens of chariots lined up on the race track. Each chariot was pulled by four horses.

Jack glanced back at Annie. She was looking up at him, pointing at the chariots.

The trumpet sounded again.

The horses took off!

The crowd went wild. They were cheering and screaming and stamping their feet.

Clouds of dust rose up as the chariots raced around the track.

Annie turned back to watch the race. She began jumping up and down.

“Go! Go! Go!” she shouted.

A few people began staring at the strange small soldier with the high-pitched voice.



Jack couldn’t take it anymore. He had to get Annie away before it was too late!

He shoved his notebook into his bag.

“I have to go!” he shouted to Plato.

The philosopher looked surprised.

Jack was afraid to tell him that Annie had broken the rules.

“I had a great time. But I have to go home now,” said Jack. “Thanks for everything!”

“Have a safe journey,” said Plato.

Jack waved and started down the steps.

As he climbed down, he saw Annie pull off her helmet.

Her pigtails flew up and down as she jumped and shouted, “Go! Go! Go!”

Her soldier’s cape fell off.

Now lots of people were staring at her. Someone shouted for the guards.

Annie was too busy cheering to notice anything.

Jack moved as quickly as he could.

But two big guards got to Annie first.



8. Save Annie!

The guards tried to pull Annie away from the chariot race.

Annie looked surprised. Then she looked angry.

“Let go of me!” she shouted.

Jack rushed down the steps of the viewing stand.

The guards were having a hard time pulling Annie through all the people.

“Leave her alone!” Jack yelled.

His voice was lost in the noise of the race.

He pushed his way through the crowd.

“Leave her alone!” he kept shouting. “Leave her alone!”

Finally, Jack reached Annie and the guards. He tried to grab her, but a guard blocked his way.

“Let her go!” yelled Jack. “I promise I’ll take her home!”

More guards arrived. The crowd began to shout, “Arrest her! Arrest her!”

The guards kept pulling Annie away.

“Jack! The story!” cried Annie.

Of course! thought Jack. The poet’s story! This is definitely our darkest hour!

He reached into his bag and pulled out the poet’s scroll.

He held the story up to the sky.

“Save Annie!” he shouted.

But Jack’s voice was again lost in the roar of the race as the four-horse chariots barreled through the dust.

Jack looked around wildly for someone—or something—to help them.

Then suddenly the crowd fell silent.

All heads turned to watch as a huge white horse galloped out of the dust.

The crowd murmured with excitement and wonder.

The white horse was the most beautiful animal Jack had ever seen.

He was pulling an empty chariot.

And he was galloping straight toward Jack.



9. Fly Away Home

The white horse stopped at the low wall by the edge of the track.

“He’s come for us!” cried Annie.

The guards stared in awe at the horse.

Annie broke free and dashed over to Jack. He grabbed her hand and they ran to the horse.

The guards shouted and started after them.

But they were too late. Jack and Annie had already climbed over the wall and into the waiting chariot.

“Go! Go! Go!” Annie cried to the huge white horse.

The horse reared and pawed the air.



The crowd stepped back from the wall.

The guards froze.

Jack looked up to where Plato was now standing. Plato smiled and waved at him.

Then the white horse leaped forward, pulling the chariot behind him.

Jack couldn’t even wave back at Plato. All he could do was hold on tight as the horse galloped beside the Olympic racers.

Jack bounced up and down. Dust and sand got in his eyes. He squeezed them shut and crouched down in the chariot.

He didn’t know where they were going. But it didn’t matter. The white horse was in charge.

Jack heard the thundering noise of the racing horses and chariots. He heard the screaming crowd.

He felt sand blowing in his face and the hard bumping and rattling of the chariot.

Suddenly, he was thrown backward. He heard a swoosh of wind, then …

Silence.

“Oh, wow!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. All he saw was blue sky. He pushed his glasses into place and looked around.

“Help!” he cried.

The white horse had grown giant feathery wings and was pulling their chariot into the sky.

Jack gripped the railing of the chariot and held on for his life.

“To the tree house!” shouted Annie.

Below, the Olympic crowd watched in stunned silence.

The winged horse left the games behind and flew over the temple of Zeus, over the statue of Nike, over the sacred olive tree and the gymnasium.



On they went: over the poet’s house, the Greek theater, and the field of white tents.

Finally, the winged horse coasted to the ground near the olive grove.

The wheels of the chariot bumped onto the grass. Then slowly, slowly, they came to a stop.

Jack and Annie stepped out of the chariot. Jack’s legs were so wobbly he could hardly walk.

Annie rushed to the horse and stroked his neck.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

Jack patted the horse’s long white neck too.

“Thanks,” he said. “That was the best ride of my life.”

The horse snorted and pawed the ground.

“Come on, Annie. We have to go before they find us,” said Jack.

“I don’t want to leave him,” said Annie. “He’s the most beautiful horse in the whole world.”

Her eyes filled with tears.

“We have to,” said Jack.

The horse put his head down and touched Annie’s forehead with his soft nose. Then he gave her a gentle push toward the tree house.

Annie sniffled but started walking. Jack took her hand as they walked through the olive grove to the rope ladder of the tree house.

“You first,” Jack said.

Annie started up the ladder. Jack followed.

When they were inside, Annie hurried to the window. Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book.

He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods and said, “I wish—”

“Look!” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. The horse had spread his great feathery wings. He was rising from the field.

The white horse flew high into the blue Olympian sky.

Then he disappeared behind the clouds.

“Bye!” called Annie.

A tear rolled down her cheek.

Jack pointed again at the Pennsylvania book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house began to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. They’re All Here

Jack opened his eyes.

It was so dark he couldn’t see anything.

He felt his clothes. He was wearing his T-shirt and jeans again. The leather bag had turned back into his backpack.

“Hello,” said Morgan le Fay. Her voice came from the corner of the tree house.

“Hi!” said Annie.

“Did you have a good journey?” asked Morgan.

“I did,” said Jack, “but girls can’t do anything fun in ancient Greece.”

“I did one fun thing,” Annie said wistfully. “I rode in a chariot pulled by a flying horse.”

“That must have been wonderful,” said Morgan. “You were very lucky to be bringing me the story of Pegasus.”

“Who?” said Jack.

“Pegasus,” said Morgan. “He’s the great white winged horse in Greek mythology.”

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack. “I think I’ve heard of him.”

He felt in his backpack and found the scroll. He gave it to Morgan. He could still barely see her in the dark.

“It was written by Anonymous,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Morgan. “Many talented women used that name in the past. Her story will be a great addition to my Camelot library.”

“Plato helped us find it,” said Jack.

“Ah, my good friend Plato,” said Morgan. “He was one of the greatest thinkers who ever lived.”

“And Pegasus was the greatest horse,” said Annie. She sighed. “I just wish I could see him again.”

“You can,” Morgan said softly. “He’s here right now.”

“Pegasus?” cried Annie. “Oh, boy!”

Annie turned on the flashlight and used it to find her way down the rope ladder.

Jack grabbed his backpack and followed her.

When they were both standing on the ground, Annie shined her flashlight at the dark trees.

“Pegasus?” she said. “Where are you? Pegasus?”

“Turn off your flashlight, Annie,” said Morgan. She was looking down from the tree house window.

Annie switched off the light.

“In the night, you can see all the story characters that saved you on your last four missions,” said Morgan. “They are all here—Hercules and the silk weaver; Sarph, the serpent monster; and Pegasus.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and studied the dark woods.

“Where are they, Morgan?” cried Annie. “Where’s Pegasus?”

“Look hard,” said Morgan.

“I can’t see him!” said Annie.

“Yes, you can,” said Morgan. “The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.”

Has Morgan gone crazy? wondered Jack.

“Look up,” said Morgan. “Your friends are in the night sky. They are stars.”

“Stars?” whispered Jack.

He stared at the shimmering field of tiny stars overhead.

“Hercules is a constellation,” said Morgan. “The Romans imagined him kneeling in the sky, holding a club over his head.”

Morgan waved her finger at the sky. For a moment Jack saw a living, breathing Hercules outlined by stars.

“And there’s the silk weaver, with her beloved cowherd,” said Morgan. “The ancient Chinese believed that they were two stars on either side of the Milky Way.”

Morgan waved her hand again. The lovely silk weaver was outlined in the heavens.

“And long ago, the Irish believed the Milky Way itself was the serpent monster Sarph,” said Morgan.

Morgan waved her hand. A giant serpent glittered through the sky.

“And the ancient Greeks named one of their constellations Pegasus,” said Morgan.

She waved her hand again and the white horse’s head, wings, and galloping legs glowed in the sky.



“I see him!” said Annie. Then she whispered, “I love you, Pegasus.”

Jack thought he saw the stars move as if Pegasus was rearing back in the sky.

After a breathless moment of silence, Morgan lowered her arm. The night sky became a field of tiny glittering stars again.

“You have done amazing work as Master Librarians,” said Morgan. “I would trust you with any important mission.”

“Does that mean we’re going on more trips?” asked Jack.

“Indeed it does,” said Morgan. “Many more.”

Jack smiled with relief.

“When is our next mission?” asked Annie.

“As soon as I need your help, I will send for you,” said Morgan. “Go home now and rest.”

“Good-bye,” said Annie.

“Good-bye,” said Jack.

“Farewell,” said Morgan.

There was a sudden rushing of wind, then a blur of blinding light. And Morgan le Fay and the magic tree house vanished.

The night was still.

“Home?” asked Annie.

“Sure,” said Jack.

As they walked between the trees, the Frog Creek woods were pitch-black.

Jack couldn’t see a thing.

But he didn’t ask Annie to turn on the flashlight. For once, he wasn’t worried about finding his way home.

He felt as if someone—or something—was leading them through the woods.

Morgan’s words came back to him: The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.

Jack looked up at the stars again. They were beginning to fade in the growing light of dawn.

But he thought he could hear the beating of giant wings, somewhere high above.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





The Olympics

The Olympics of ancient Greece were held for over a thousand years, from 776 B.C. to A.D. 394.

Every four years, the games were held in several cities, including the town of Olympia, for five days in August. (The modern Olympics were named after Olympia.)

For two months, all fighting and wars ceased so people could travel safely to and from the Olympics.

The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.

Greek athletes believed that having a physically fit body was a way to honor their chief god, Zeus. Olympia’s statue of Zeus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Unfortunately, it no longer exists.

Greek Language

The word anonymous comes from a Greek word that means “nameless.”

The English language has many words that were originally Greek, especially words having to do with sports, such as gymnasium, marathon, and athlete; words having to do with science, such as psychology and astronomy; and words related to the arts, such as drama, theater, and scenery.

The word museum is also of Greek origin. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greeks built a temple to the nine goddesses known as the Muses. They called the temple the Museum.

Some Greek letters are similar to ours. The Greek A is called alpha. The B is called beta. That’s where we get our word alphabet.

Democracy

About 2,500 years ago, the Greeks adopted a system of government called a democracy. Under the Greek democracy, all citizens had a say in the government. At that time, however, women and slaves were not considered citizens.

Plato

Plato the philosopher lived in ancient Greece in the fourth century B.C. Plato founded a school called the Academy. In both his teachings and his writings, Plato explored the best way for a government to be set up. His ideas are still talked about today.

Zeus

Zeus was god of the skies and ruler of all the Greek gods and goddesses. Zeus and his family were called Olympians because they lived on top of a mountain called Mount Olympus. The major Greek gods and goddesses were later adopted by the Romans. Zeus was called Jupiter by the Romans.

Pegasus

In Greek mythology, a great winged horse sprang from the neck of a snake-haired monster known as Medusa. The horse was named Pegasus, which may come from a Greek word that means “spring.” Pegasus was tamed by a young man named Bellerophon.

Star Myths

In ancient times, mythic characters from different world cultures were sometimes identified as patterns of stars in the night sky. Once a hero or heroine took a place in the heavens, he or she became famous forever.

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Jack finished tying his sneakers. Then he looked out his bedroom window.

A small dog stood in the early sunlight. He had floppy ears and scruffy brown fur.

“Teddy!” said Jack.

Just then, Annie ran into Jack’s room.

“Teddy’s back!” she said. “It’s time.”

It was time for their second mission to help free the little dog from a spell.



Jack threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he followed Annie downstairs and past the kitchen.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Outside,” said Jack.

“Breakfast will be ready soon,” she said. “And Grandmother will be here any minute.”

“We’ll be right back,” said Jack. He loved his grandmother’s visits. She was kind and funny. And she always taught them new things.

Jack and Annie slipped out the front door. Teddy was waiting for them.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Hey, where did you go last week?” Jack asked.

The small dog wagged his tail joyfully.

Then he ran up the sidewalk.

“Wait for us!” Annie shouted.

She and Jack followed Teddy up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

They ran between the trees. Wind rattled the leaves. Birds swooped from branch to branch.

Teddy stopped at a rope ladder that hung from the tallest oak tree in the woods. At the top of the ladder was the magic tree house.

Jack and Annie stared up at it.

“No sign of Morgan,” said Annie.

“Let’s go up,” said Jack.

Annie picked up Teddy. She carried him carefully up the ladder. Jack climbed after her.

Inside the tree house, Teddy sniffed a silver pocket watch on the floor. Beside it was the note that Morgan had written to Jack and Annie.

Annie picked up the note and read it aloud:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be brave. Be wise. Be careful.



“We’ve got the first special thing,” said Annie, “the gift from a ship lost at sea.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He picked up the silver pocket watch.

The time on the watch was 2:20—the time the Titanic had sunk.

Jack and Annie stared at the watch.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy’s barking brought Jack back from his memories.

“Okay,” Jack said. He sighed and pushed his glasses into place. “Now it’s time for the gift from the prairie blue.”

“What’s that mean?” said Annie.

“I’m not sure,” said Jack. He looked around the tree house. “But I bet that book will take us there.”

He picked up a book in the corner. The cover was a picture of a wide prairie. The title was The Great Plains.

“Ready?” Jack said.

Teddy yipped and wagged his tail.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. “The sooner we free Teddy, the better.”

Jack pointed at the cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,





During the past year, many of my readers have requested that Jack and Annie visit the Titanic. At first, I thought the story was too sad. However, as more and more requests came in, I began to think about it, for I take the suggestions of kids very seriously. So I tried to think of a way that Jack and Annie might actually be helpful in the midst of such a tragedy. I talked about my ideas with a lot of kids, including my nephews, Peter and Andrew. Finally, I decided to go ahead and write the story.

Now I am glad I did. While researching the true story of the Titanic, I learned a lot about human dignity and courage in the face of disaster. So I thank all the readers who wrote a letter or raised a hand in a school assembly or sent an e-mail to our Web site that said, “Please write a Magic Tree House book about the Titanic.” This one’s for you.





All my best,

For Bailey,

the magic terrier in my life





One day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

Now, in book #17, they are about to begin a new set of adventures …



1. A New Mission

Jack opened his eyes.

It was a stormy night. The rain tapped hard on his window pane.

“Do you hear what the rain is saying?” said a voice.

Jack turned on his lamp.

Annie stood in his doorway. She wore her rain poncho over her pajamas and held a flashlight.

“It’s saying, Come now!” she said.

“You’re nuts,” said Jack.

“Listen, just listen,” said Annie.

Jack listened.

The rain did seem to be tapping out Come now! Come now!

“We have to go to the tree house,” said Annie. “Something important is about to happen.”

“Now?” said Jack.

Jack didn’t want to leave his warm, cozy room. But he had a feeling Annie was right. Something important was about to happen.

“You coming?” she said.

“Yeah, yeah,” he said.

He climbed out of bed.

“Just put on your rain poncho,” said Annie.

Jack threw his rain poncho over his pajamas. He pulled on his sneakers and grabbed his backpack.

“Don’t forget your Master Librarian card,” said Annie. “I have mine with me.”

Jack put the card with the glowing letters ML on it into his backpack.

“I’m ready,” he said.

Jack and Annie went quietly down the stairs. Then they slipped out the door into the chilly, damp night.

The storm had eased up. Rain fell gently as they ran up the street. The wet ground glistened in the beam of the flashlight.

They headed into the Frog Creek woods. Wind blew through the trees, shaking water to the ground.

Jack shivered. He wiped raindrops off his glasses.



“Brrr,” said Annie. “I’m cold.”

“Me, too,” said Jack.

As they kept walking, Annie pointed the flashlight up into the trees.

“There it is,” she said. Her light had found the tree house.

“Morgan!” Jack called.

There was no answer.

“I wonder what’s wrong,” said Annie. “I was sure she’d be here.”

“Let’s go up and see,” said Jack.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack followed. Rain dripped from the trees onto his poncho.

They climbed into the tree house. Annie shined her light into each corner. The first three corners were empty.

Then the flashlight beam hit the fourth. Jack and Annie gasped with surprise.

Sitting in the corner was a small dog. He looked like a terrier puppy. He had scruffy light brown fur.

He stared sadly at Jack and Annie.

“Oh!” whispered Annie.



“Where did you come from?” said Jack.

Annie patted the dog’s head. He wagged his tail.

“He’s so cute,” she said. “He looks like a little teddy bear. Hi, Teddy.”

Teddy was actually a good name for him, Jack thought.

“Where did you come from, Teddy?” he asked.

The little dog whimpered.

“Don’t be sad,” said Annie. “Everything’s okay.”

“How did he get up here?” Jack asked.

“I don’t know. But I bet Morgan had something to do with it,” said Annie.

Jack’s gaze fell on a piece of paper lying on the floor.

“I think you’re right,” he said.

He picked up the paper. On it was fancy writing that said:


This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

Morgan

P.S. Your Master Librarian cards won’t help on this mission. Just be yourselves and all will be well.



“What kind of spell do you think Teddy is under?” said Annie.

“Who knows?” said Jack.

“Poor thing,” said Annie. She patted the dog’s head. He licked her hand.

“It looks like we have to take four trips,” said Jack.

Teddy trotted over to a book. He pushed it with his nose.

“Look!” said Annie. “I bet that will take us on the first trip.”

She picked up the book that the little dog had chosen.

“Good job, Teddy,” she said.

The title of the book was The Unsinkable Ship.

“Well, at least that’s good,” said Jack. “The ship won’t sink, even if it is lost.”

“Ready, Teddy?” asked Annie.

“Arf! Arf!” he answered.

Jack pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. The Unsinkable Ship

“Arf! Arf!?”

Jack opened his eyes. He shivered. Wherever they were now, it was cold—very cold.

Teddy barked again.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

Annie shined the flashlight on her clothes.

“Wow, we’re dressed like old-fashioned kids!” she said.

Instead of pajamas and a poncho, she wore a sailor dress and a long wool cloak.

Jack had on an overcoat and knee-length pants with long socks. His backpack had turned to leather. He also had on a shirt and tie.

“Where are we?” he wondered aloud.

Jack and Annie looked out the window.

The moonless sky glittered with stars.

There was a soft wind and the sound of water lapping.

The tree house seemed to be resting on a wooden deck between two giant columns.

Jack looked up and saw smoke coming out of the columns.

“We must have landed on the ship between the smokestacks,” he said.

Then Jack looked straight ahead and saw a box high in the air, near the front of the ship.

“That must be the lookouts’ nest,” he said.

Jack sat back in the tree house and opened their book. Annie handed him the flashlight.

“Let’s find out where we are,” he said.

He turned to a picture of a huge ocean liner. By the light of the flashlight, he read:

Late at night, on April 14, 1912, an English ocean liner was making her first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. She was going to New York City. Carrying 2,200 passengers, the ship was four city blocks long. Most people believed the ship was unsinkable.



“Oh, man, we’re in 1912,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“This ship is huge,” said Annie. “How will we ever find the gift to help free Teddy?”

“You can’t go looking for a gift,” said Jack. “You have to wait until someone gives it to you.”

“Right,” said Annie with a sigh. “Well, I guess we just have to be ourselves, like Morgan said. And maybe we’ll get lucky.”

“This is hard,” said Jack.

The little dog whined.

“Don’t worry, Teddy,” said Annie. “We’ll free you from your spell.”

Just then, a shout came from the lookouts’ nest: “Iceberg ahead!”

Jack and Annie turned back to the window—just in time to see a huge iceberg looming out of the sea.

The iceberg was dark with a fringe of white at the top. And it was right in front of the ship!



Jack felt a jolt. Then he heard a grinding sound. The ship was scraping against the mountain of ice.

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked.

“Shhh, don’t be scared,” said Annie.

She picked the dog up and hugged him.

The scraping sound stopped. The ship slid past the iceberg until they lost sight of it.

The night was calm again.

“See?” Annie said to Teddy. “It was just a little bump. This ship is unsinkable.”

But Jack was worried. “Wait. I have to read more about this,” he said.

“Don’t read now, Jack,” said Annie. “It’s time to get the gift. Come on, Teddy.”

She picked up the little dog and the flashlight. And she climbed out the tree house window.

“Hey—don’t take the flashlight!” said Jack.

But Annie was gone.

“Annie!” called Jack.

He heard a soft “Yikes.”

Annie stuck her head back in the tree house.

“Bad news,” she said in a whisper. “I think you’d better see this.”

Jack threw his stuff into his knapsack. He put it on and climbed out the window.

Annie was standing by the ship’s railing, holding Teddy.

Without a word, she shined the flashlight on a life preserver hanging from the railing.

In big black letters were the words:

R.M.S. TITANIC



3. SOS

Jack stared at the name of the ship.

“You know what happened to the Titanic, don’t you?” he said softly.

Annie nodded.

“It hit an iceberg and sank,” she said. “But I don’t get it. I thought this ship was unsinkable.”

“That’s what people thought when the Titanic was built,” said Jack. “But they were wrong.”

Suddenly, steam gushed out of the ship’s smokestacks. Then the engines cut off. The Titanic stopped moving.

“We’d better go home,” said Jack. “There’s nothing we can do here. We’ll have to find another lost ship—a safer one.”

“No! We have to stay and help,” said Annie. “We can escape in the tree house anytime we want.”

“But what can we do?” said Jack. “This ship’s going to sink no matter what. We can’t change history. And we can’t take anyone into our time with us.”

“Yeah, but maybe there’s some way we can help,” said Annie.

“How?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Let’s look around.” Holding Teddy, she disappeared down a small stairway.

Jack followed her to a lower level.

Annie put Teddy down on the deck. The dog sniffed the chunks of ice that had fallen off the iceberg.

The ship seemed strangely empty.

“Where is everyone?” Annie asked.

“Maybe they’re still asleep,” said Jack. “They probably don’t even know the ship hit something.”

Annie and Jack started toward the front of the Titanic.

“Come on, Teddy,” said Annie.

The little dog scampered after them.

They passed the round windows of different rooms on the ship. Jack looked through them as they went by.

He saw exercise bikes and rowing machines in one room. In another, there were palm trees, bamboo chairs, and tables. Next, they passed a library filled with books.

“This ship is like a town,” said Jack.

Near the end of the deck, they peeked through another round window. Inside a little room, a man was wearing earphones.

Jack heard a clicking noise as the man tapped a lever on a black box.

“What’s he doing?” whispered Annie.

Jack shrugged.

Another man stood nearby. He had a white beard and wore a fancy uniform.

“Send the international call for help,” he ordered the man with headphones. “Tell all ships close by to come at once. We’re sinking.”

“Yes, Captain,” said the man.

“Great, they’re calling for help!” Annie whispered.

Jack shook his head. “I don’t think help will come,” he said.



He shined the flashlight on the book and found a picture of the radio operator.

He read quietly to Annie:

After the Titanic hit the iceberg at 11:40 P.M., the ship’s radio operator sent out an SOS. An SOS is the international distress signal in Morse code. Unfortunately, the only ship near the Titanic had turned off its radio for the night. All the other ships who received the message were too far away to help. When the Titanic sank around 2:20 A.M., she was all alone.



“That’s terrible,” said Annie.

“I wonder what time it is now,” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“He’s leaving,” whispered Annie.

“Hide!” whispered Jack.

He and Annie moved quickly into the shadows.

The captain stepped out onto the deck.

“Tell the men to start loading the lifeboats now,” the captain ordered a deck hand.

“Yes, Captain!” the man answered.

The captain and the deck hand left. Annie turned to Jack.

“At least that’s good,” she whispered. “Everyone can get into the lifeboats.”

“I don’t think it’s good enough,” said Jack. He read from the book again:

On the Titanic, there were 20 lifeboats. To save all the passengers, the ship needed twice as many. But with all the confusion on board, a number of the lifeboats were not even full when they left the ship. Many third-class passengers did not have a chance to get into any of the lifeboats because they were on the lower decks and didn’t know where to go.



Jack wrote in his notebook:



“Hey, I know what we can do to help,” said Annie.

“What?” asked Jack.

“We can help someone find the lifeboats,” she said.

“You’re right!” said Jack. “With our book, we can find our way to a lower deck.”

He turned the page to a map of the ship. He and Annie studied it.

“We’ll start at the grand stairway,” said Jack. He traced a path with his finger. “Then we’ll go down to the third-class cabins this way.”

“Good plan!” said Annie.

Jack looked back through the door. The radio operator was still tapping out his message—over and over and over.

“SOS,” whispered Jack.

He took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he said. “Let’s go.”



4. Put on Your Life Belts!

Jack and Annie slipped through a door off the boat deck. Teddy was at their heels.

“Wow,” breathed Annie.

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked.

They were at the top of the empty grand stairway. It was beautiful. It was made of dark, glossy wood. A huge dome with lights hung above it.

At the top of the stairs was a fancy clock.

The hands of the clock were at 12:20.

“Oh, man, it’s twenty minutes after midnight!” said Jack. “The ship’s going down in two hours!”

They hurried down the carpeted steps and into the first-class hallway. Teddy followed along.

Jack looked at the map in the book.

“These are the staterooms,” he said. “This hall will take us to the third-class open deck.”

“Hey, look,” said Annie. “The floor’s slanting down.”

Jack caught his breath. She was right.

“That means the front of the ship is already sinking,” he said.

Just then, a man in a white uniform came down the hall.

He knocked on the doors.

“Put on your life belts at once and come up to the boat deck!” he called.

Men and women stumbled out of their rooms. They wore elegant robes made of shiny cloth and velvet.

“What’s going on?” a woman asked.

“There’s been a little accident,” the man in the uniform said cheerfully.

“Oh, how silly,” said the woman.

“It’s not silly!” said Annie. “Do what he says!”

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked, as if he agreed with Annie.

“Shhh, Teddy!” said Jack.

He picked up the little dog. Then he and Annie hurried down the hall. They crossed the third-class open deck, where more people were standing.

These people were not dressed in fancy clothes. They mostly wore plain, dark coats. They didn’t seem worried either. They were all joking and laughing.

Jack and Annie slipped through the crowd. They went into a big smoky room.

Four men were playing cards.

A woman played the piano. A young couple danced to the music.

“Put on your life belts and go up to the boat deck!” Annie shouted.

The people looked at Annie in surprise. The card players smiled at her.

She opened her mouth to yell again, but Jack pulled her out the door.

“Come on,” he said. “We have to get down to the third-class cabins before it’s too late.”

They hurried down another hall. Then they climbed down another stairway. Jack carried Teddy the whole way.

At the bottom of the stairs, they rounded a corner, and they both gasped.

The floor was really slanting down here, and water sloshed at the end of a hallway.

“The Titanic is sinking,” said Jack.

“But no one understands!” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. It made him feel terribly sad.

Teddy whined. Jack buried his face in the little dog’s fur.

“Come on!” said Annie.

She began banging on the cabin doors.

The doors swung open. The cabins were all empty.

“The people from this hallway must be the ones up near the lounge,” said Jack. “Maybe we should go down to a lower deck.”

He started to walk back to the stairs. But Teddy began barking furiously.

“What’s wrong with him?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie.

Suddenly, the dog leaped out of Jack’s arms. He charged down the hall.

He was running straight toward the water!

“Watch out!” cried Jack.

He and Annie ran after Teddy.

The dog began barking at a closed door.

The door opened.

A very small boy peeked out.



5. William and Lucy

The boy wore a nightshirt. He had red hair and freckles. He looked about four years old.

He rubbed his eyes sleepily. Then he saw Teddy.

“Puppy!” he said with a huge smile.

He threw his arms around the little dog’s neck. Teddy licked his face.

“Come back to bed, William,” a voice called from inside the room.

“Come out!” Annie shouted. “It’s an emergency!”

A moment later, the door opened wider. A girl in a long white nightgown peeked out.

She had red hair and freckles, too. She was tall and thin. She looked to be about twelve or thirteen years old.

“Hello,” she said. She put her arm around the little boy. “I’m Lucy O’Malley. This is my brother, William.”

“I’m Annie,” said Annie. “And this is my brother, Jack.”

“Get your parents and tell them to come with us,” said Jack.



Lucy looked confused.

“Our parents aren’t here. They’re in New York,” she said. “We’re on our way to them.”

“Listen, the Titanic has hit an iceberg,” said Annie. “We’ll take you to a lifeboat.”

“What do you mean?” said Lucy.

“The ship’s sinking,” said Annie. “Look.”

She pointed to the water at the end of the hall.



“Oh, no!” cried Lucy.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Jack. “Just get your coats and your life belts. We don’t have much time.”

Lucy nodded. Then she went back inside the room and came out with their things.

Lucy pulled on her coat and her life belt. Annie helped William put his on.

“Let’s go,” said Jack.

“Wait—can Teddy fit in your knapsack?” said Annie.

“Try,” said Jack.

Annie slipped the little dog into the leather knapsack on Jack’s back. Only Teddy’s front paws and head stuck out.

“Stay there, honey,” said Annie. She kissed Teddy on the nose.

Jack didn’t feel any extra weight in his knapsack. The little dog felt as light as air.

“Wait—I forgot something,” said Lucy.

“We don’t have time—” started Jack.

But Lucy rushed back into the room.

“Hurry!” shouted Annie.

When Lucy came out, Jack saw her slip something into her coat pocket. Then she grabbed William’s hand.

“Ready?” said Jack.

Suddenly, he felt freezing water brush against his shoes.

He looked down. The green sea water was slowly moving down the hall.

“Arf! Arf!” barked Teddy from Jack’s pack.

“Run!” cried Annie.



6. Women and Children First

Annie led everyone down the hall to the stairs, away from the cold sea water.

As she and Lucy helped William up the stairs, Jack and Teddy followed.

Halfway up the staircase, Teddy let out a yelp.

Jack looked back.

The water was creeping up the stairs, step by step.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie shouted.

Jack ran up the rest of the stairs.

He and Annie led William and Lucy through the smoky room. The men were still playing cards.

“To the lifeboats!” Annie yelled at the card players. “Right now! Hurry!”

The men smiled at her again.

“Little girl,” one said with a laugh, “even if this ship does sink, it will take all night. There’s plenty of time for everyone on board to be rescued.”

“Indeed. Many ships are on their way right now,” another man said in a soothing voice. “There’s nothing to worry about.”

“Not true!” said Annie.

Lucy turned to Jack.

“This doesn’t sound so bad, after all,” she said.

“It is bad. Please trust me,” said Jack. “We have to keep going.”

They went outside. The crowd on the third-class deck had grown.

Many wore life belts. But no one here seemed very worried yet.

Jack and Annie pulled Lucy and William along. They hurried through the crowd and down the first-class hall. They came to the end and trooped up the grand staircase.

On the top deck, the Titanic was as bright as a Christmas tree.

A band played lively music.

With a hiss and rush of light, a rocket streaked into the sky. It made a loud boom! Then it burst into many colored balls.

Shivering in the cold, William laughed and clapped.

“Fireworks!” he said.

Lucy smiled at Jack and Annie.

“This is a trick, isn’t it?” she said. “You’ve brought us to a party.”

“No, it isn’t,” said Jack. “Don’t you remember the water downstairs?”

Lucy’s smile faded.

“Women and children first!” someone shouted.

“That’s you!” said Annie. “Come on!”

She pulled Lucy and William toward a lifeboat.



7. The Gift

The lifeboat was waiting to go down. It looked tiny as it swung on cables at the side of the big ship. The water below looked black.

“Get in! Get in!” a uniformed man shouted.

“No, no,” said William. He hid his face against Lucy’s coat.

Lucy was shaking her head.

“I’d rather stay here,” she said to Jack and Annie.

Jack understood. The brightly lit Titanic seemed so solid and safe compared to the little lifeboat.

“You can’t stay here,” said Annie. “The Titanic is going to sink soon.”

“Very soon,” said Jack.

Lucy kept shaking her head. Jack saw tears in her eyes.

“Lucy, we’re telling the truth,” said Jack. “You and William are in great danger.”

“You have to be brave now,” said Annie. “For your brother’s sake.”

Lucy straightened up and tried to smile.

“All right,” she said. “I will.”

“This way!” a man called. “Women and children! This way, you four!”

He pointed at them.

“Get in,” said Jack. He gently pushed Lucy and William forward.

“Good-bye, Lucy,” said Annie. “Good-bye, William.”

Lucy looked surprised.

“You’re not coming?” she asked.

“No, we’re going home another way,” said Annie.

“Oh, dear,” said Lucy. “I hope you’ll be safe.”

“We will. Don’t worry!” said Jack.

“Wait,” said Lucy.

She reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a silver watch on a chain.

“This is a gift for both of you,” she said. “It’s our father’s watch. We carried it on the voyage for good luck. I have a feeling that the two of you were our good luck tonight.”

Jack looked at the watch as Lucy put it around Annie’s neck.

The time on the watch was 1:50.

There were only thirty minutes left!

“Hurry, hurry!” he said.

Jack and Annie watched as a big man picked Lucy up and swung her into the little boat. Then he picked William up and put him in Lucy’s lap.

“Bye!” cried Annie. She stepped forward to blow a kiss.

Just then, the man picked Annie up.

“No!” shouted Annie.

“Into the lifeboat, my dear!” the man said. And he tossed Annie into the lifeboat.

“No! No!” cried Jack.

Then the man reached for him, too. Jack jumped away just in time.

“Annie!” he yelled. “Get out!”

Annie tried to climb out of the lifeboat.



“Let me out!” she cried.

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked from over Jack’s shoulder.

The lifeboat jerked. It started creaking down toward the dark, cold sea.

“Come back!” Jack called.

But there was nothing he could do as Annie disappeared from sight.



8. Every Man for Himself

“Annie!” cried Jack.

“Let me out!” he heard Annie shout.

But the lifeboat kept going down.

“Wait for me!” came a loud voice. “Wait for me!”

A woman in a fur coat appeared at the railing. She nearly threw herself over the side of the ship.

“Stop!” the uniformed man called. “Bring the boat back up for Lady Blackwell!”

Slowly, the lifeboat was brought back up.

Jack pushed his way forward. The lifeboat came even with the ship. Jack reached out to Annie.

She grabbed his hands. He pulled her back onto the sinking ship.

“Room for one more!” Annie shouted to Lady Blackwell.

Then she and Jack took off before anyone could catch them.

They ran up the slanting deck. Annie stopped and peered over the railing.

Jack looked, too.

They saw Lucy and William’s little lifeboat creaking down toward the Atlantic Ocean. It reached the glassy black water. Then it floated off into the darkness.

Annie waved.

“Bye, William! Bye, Lucy!” she shouted. “Thank you for your gift!”

She held up the watch that hung from her neck. Then she and Jack looked at it.

The time was 2:05.

“Only fifteen minutes left!” said Annie.

“We have to get back to the tree house now!” said Jack. “Let’s climb the stairs to the smokestacks!”

Suddenly, the front of the ship dipped down into the sea. Deck chairs started to slide past Jack and Annie.

The band played a slow, calm song. It sounded like a church hymn.

But the crowd started to panic. People pushed and shouted, trying to get to a safer part of the ship.

“It’s every man for himself!” the captain shouted to all of his crew.

The men all stopped what they were doing and ran up the deck.

Jack and Annie ran, too.

They dodged sliding tables and chairs.



They reached the stairs that led to the smokestacks.

They grabbed the railing and pulled themselves up the steps.

The ship tilted further.

“Get to those smokestacks!” cried Jack.

They slipped and crawled down the deck.

But when they got to the smokestacks, Jack and Annie looked around wildly.

The magic tree house was gone!



9. Time Stops

“Where is it?” shouted Annie.

The front of the Titanic sank deeper into the sea. Jack and Annie fell forward.

They grabbed the railing and held on for their lives.

“Maybe the tree house fell into the ocean!” shouted Jack.

A great roar started coming from the ship.

Jack imagined everything crashing forward—all the furniture, dishes, bicycles, the grand clock on the staircase.

He looked down. A giant wave of water rolled over a lower deck.

Jack imagined water flooding the third-class corridor, the card room, and the grand staircase.

He closed his eyes, waiting to be washed away.

“Arf! Arf!”

The barking came from a distance.

“Teddy!” cried Annie.

Jack had forgotten all about the little dog.

Holding on to the railing, he used one hand to pull off his knapsack.

Teddy wasn’t there!

There was more frantic barking.

“Where’s Teddy?” cried Jack.

“He’s calling us!” shouted Annie.



“We can’t look for him!” shouted Jack. “We’ll fall off the ship!”

Teddy barked and barked.

“He’s close by!” said Annie.

She held on to the railing and moved slowly down the steep deck.

“Annie!” cried Jack.

Suddenly, the lights on the Titanic went out. The world was pitch-dark.

Jack couldn’t see Annie at all.

“Annie!” he shouted.

He tried to move down the deck, too.

But the ship tilted again. Jack slipped and fell.

He rolled until he crashed into a smokestack.

“Jack!” cried Annie. “Here! Here!”

Teddy kept barking.

The back of the Titanic was rising out of the ocean. The front of the ship was going down.

Jack tried to go around the smokestack without falling.

In the dark, he could barely see the tree house. It was stuck between a smokestack and the railing. It was lying on its side.

Annie and Teddy were looking out the window.

“Teddy’s barking led me here!” cried Annie. “Hurry, Jack!”

Jack crawled around the smokestack.

He held out his hand. Annie grabbed it. She pulled him into the tree house.

Teddy licked his face.

“I wish we could go home!” shouted Annie, pointing at the Pennsylvania book.

Jack heard a loud CRA-A-A-ACK!

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. A Touch of Magic

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

He was lying on the floor of the tree house. He was wearing his pajamas and rain poncho again.

“You okay?” Annie asked.

“Yeah. You?” said Jack.

“My heart’s beating really fast,” said Annie.

“Mine, too,” said Jack.

He thought of the Titanic sinking into the cold black sea. His eyes filled with tears.

“It was terrible,” he said.

Annie nodded. Jack could see tears on her cheeks.

Teddy licked Jack’s face.

“Hey,” said Jack. “How did you get out of my knapsack?”

Teddy whined. Jack and Annie stroked his furry head and ears.

“I think he has a touch of magic,” said Annie.

Slowly, Jack sat up.

“He saved our lives,” he said.

“And now we have the first gift to break the spell he’s under,” said Annie.

She turned on her flashlight. She shined it on the silver pocket watch that hung from her neck.

“Lucy’s gift,” she said.

The watch had stopped. The hands were at 2:20.

Jack was silent. Then he sighed.

“That’s exactly when the ship went down,” he said.

Annie looked at him.

“I guess that’s when time stopped for the Titanic,” she said.

Jack nodded.

Annie put the pocket watch on top of Morgan’s note.

“A gift from a ship lost at sea,” she said softly.

They were both quiet.

Then Jack took off his glasses and wiped the tears from his eyes.



Annie stood up. She took a deep breath.

“I’m ready to go,” she said. “Let’s put Teddy in your pack and take him home with us.”

She shined her flashlight around the tree house.

“Teddy?” she said.

There was no sign of the little dog.

“He’s not here,” said Annie.

“What are you talking about?” said Jack. “We were just petting him.”

“He’s up to his magic tricks again,” said Annie. She sighed. “We’ll have to go home without him.”

“But what happened to him?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But I have a feeling we’ll see him again soon.”

She started down the rope ladder. Jack looked around the tree house one last time.

“Teddy?” he said.

But the tree house was quiet.

Jack pulled on his backpack and climbed down the rope ladder.

Annie was waiting for him.

Without a word, Jack took her hand.

The rain had stopped. But water still dripped from the trees.

Stars glittered overhead in a clear sky.

Silently, Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods. They walked up the dark street to their house and climbed the steps to their porch.

Before they went inside, they looked out again at the night.

“Time might have stopped for the Titanic,” Jack said. “But books and memories keep the Titanic alive, don’t they? It’s a true story, but it’s also like a myth now.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “And every time the story’s told, we wish it had a different ending.”

Jack nodded. That was exactly how he felt.

Staring at the starry sky, he shuddered at the memory of the sinking ship.

He knew that he and Annie were lucky. They had come home.

“Good night, Titanic,” he said softly. “Good-bye.”

Then he and Annie slipped quietly into their house, where it was cozy and dry and very safe.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





1) The Titanic hit the iceberg in the North Atlantic, approximately 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.


2) The Titanic was considered unsinkable because she was built with huge watertight doors to contain any possible leaks. However, when the ship hit the iceberg, six watertight compartments quickly filled up with water, dooming the ship.


3) The signal SOS was chosen as an international distress call because of the simplicity of the three letters in Morse code: three dots, three dashes, and three dots.


4) No one knows for certain exactly how long the musicians played on the Titanic, but legend says they played until the ship went down, and their last song was the hymn “Nearer My God to Thee.”


5) More than 1,500 people perished in the Titanic disaster, while 705 people escaped in lifeboats and were eventually rescued by a ship named the Carpathia.


6) After the sinking of the Titanic, laws were changed so that every ship was required to have enough lifeboats to carryall its passengers. Also, the International Ice Patrol was formed, so that ships would have warning about ice conditions.


7) In 1985, a scientist named Dr. Robert Ballard discovered the undersea wreck of the Titanic.

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Jack finished tying his sneakers. Then he looked out his bedroom window.

A small dog stood in the early sunlight. He had floppy ears and scruffy brown fur.

“Teddy!” said Jack.

Just then, Annie ran into Jack’s room.

“Teddy’s back!” she said. “It’s time.”

It was time for their second mission to help free the little dog from a spell.



Jack threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he followed Annie downstairs and past the kitchen.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Outside,” said Jack.

“Breakfast will be ready soon,” she said. “And Grandmother will be here any minute.”

“We’ll be right back,” said Jack. He loved his grandmother’s visits. She was kind and funny. And she always taught them new things.

Jack and Annie slipped out the front door. Teddy was waiting for them.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Hey, where did you go last week?” Jack asked.

The small dog wagged his tail joyfully.

Then he ran up the sidewalk.

“Wait for us!” Annie shouted.

She and Jack followed Teddy up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

They ran between the trees. Wind rattled the leaves. Birds swooped from branch to branch.

Teddy stopped at a rope ladder that hung from the tallest oak tree in the woods. At the top of the ladder was the magic tree house.

Jack and Annie stared up at it.

“No sign of Morgan,” said Annie.

“Let’s go up,” said Jack.

Annie picked up Teddy. She carried him carefully up the ladder. Jack climbed after her.

Inside the tree house, Teddy sniffed a silver pocket watch on the floor. Beside it was the note that Morgan had written to Jack and Annie.

Annie picked up the note and read it aloud:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be brave. Be wise. Be careful.



“We’ve got the first special thing,” said Annie, “the gift from a ship lost at sea.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He picked up the silver pocket watch.

The time on the watch was 2:20—the time the Titanic had sunk.

Jack and Annie stared at the watch.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy’s barking brought Jack back from his memories.

“Okay,” Jack said. He sighed and pushed his glasses into place. “Now it’s time for the gift from the prairie blue.”

“What’s that mean?” said Annie.

“I’m not sure,” said Jack. He looked around the tree house. “But I bet that book will take us there.”

He picked up a book in the corner. The cover was a picture of a wide prairie. The title was The Great Plains.

“Ready?” Jack said.

Teddy yipped and wagged his tail.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. “The sooner we free Teddy, the better.”

Jack pointed at the cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

For several years I’ve wanted Jack and Annie to visit Native American people in the 1800s. I wasn’t sure which tribe they should visit, for there are many different Native American tribes, and each is unique with its own customs, language, and way of life.

Finally, I settled on the Lakota, a tribe of the Great Plains. My research was a bit difficult, though, because I discovered that there are several groups of Lakota Indians, each different from the other. Also, many Lakota customs and beliefs have never been written down, so no one can say for sure what their way of life was actually like over a century ago.

But in Buffalo Before Breakfast, I have tried to share with you the most basic information I’ve learned about the traditional ways of the Lakota people. Jack, Annie, and I feel privileged to have spent a short “visit” with these interesting people. And we hope that you will, too.

All my best,

For Natalie,

kind and funny grandmother

of Andrew and Peter



OceanofPDF.com




One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free a mysterious dog from a magic spell. They have already received one gift on a trip to the Titanic. And now they are about to set out in search of the second gift.…

1. Teddy’s Back!

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Jack finished tying his sneakers. Then he looked out his bedroom window.

A small dog stood in the early sunlight. He had floppy ears and scruffy brown fur.

“Teddy!” said Jack.

Just then, Annie ran into Jack’s room.

“Teddy’s back!” she said. “It’s time.”

It was time for their second mission to help free the little dog from a spell.



Jack threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he followed Annie downstairs and past the kitchen.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Outside,” said Jack.

“Breakfast will be ready soon,” she said. “And Grandmother will be here any minute.”

“We’ll be right back,” said Jack. He loved his grandmother’s visits. She was kind and funny. And she always taught them new things.

Jack and Annie slipped out the front door. Teddy was waiting for them.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Hey, where did you go last week?” Jack asked.

The small dog wagged his tail joyfully.

Then he ran up the sidewalk.

“Wait for us!” Annie shouted.

She and Jack followed Teddy up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

They ran between the trees. Wind rattled the leaves. Birds swooped from branch to branch.

Teddy stopped at a rope ladder that hung from the tallest oak tree in the woods. At the top of the ladder was the magic tree house.

Jack and Annie stared up at it.

“No sign of Morgan,” said Annie.

“Let’s go up,” said Jack.

Annie picked up Teddy. She carried him carefully up the ladder. Jack climbed after her.

Inside the tree house, Teddy sniffed a silver pocket watch on the floor. Beside it was the note that Morgan had written to Jack and Annie.

Annie picked up the note and read it aloud:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be brave. Be wise. Be careful.



“We’ve got the first special thing,” said Annie, “the gift from a ship lost at sea.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He picked up the silver pocket watch.

The time on the watch was 2:20—the time the Titanic had sunk.

Jack and Annie stared at the watch.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy’s barking brought Jack back from his memories.

“Okay,” Jack said. He sighed and pushed his glasses into place. “Now it’s time for the gift from the prairie blue.”

“What’s that mean?” said Annie.

“I’m not sure,” said Jack. He looked around the tree house. “But I bet that book will take us there.”

He picked up a book in the corner. The cover was a picture of a wide prairie. The title was The Great Plains.

“Ready?” Jack said.

Teddy yipped and wagged his tail.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. “The sooner we free Teddy, the better.”

Jack pointed at the cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. Oceans of Grass

Early sunlight slanted into the tree house. The cool breeze smelled of wild grass.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “These are neat clothes.”

Their jeans and T-shirts had magically changed. Jack had on a buckskin shirt and pants. Annie wore a fringed buckskin dress.

They both wore soft leather boots and coonskin caps. Jack’s backpack was now a leather bag.

“I feel like a mountain man,” he said.

“All you’re missing is a mountain,” said Annie. She pointed out the window.

Jack and Teddy looked out.

The tree house sat in a lone tree in a vast golden prairie. The sun was rising in the distance.

Wind whispered through the tall yellow grass. Shh—shh—shh, it said.

“We need a gift from the prairie blue,” said Jack.

“I bet that means the sky,” said Annie, looking up.

“Yep,” said Jack. The sky was growing bluer as they watched. “But how are we supposed to get it?”

“Just like last time,” said Annie. “We have to wait till someone gives it to us.”

“I don’t see any sign of people out there,” said Jack.

He opened their book and read aloud.

The Great Plains are in the middle of the United States. Before the 20th century, this vast prairie covered nearly a fifth of America’s land. Some called it “an ocean of grass.”



Jack pulled out his notebook.

“Come on,” said Annie.

She picked up Teddy and carried him down the ladder.

Jack quickly wrote:



“Wow, this is like an ocean of grass,” Annie called from below.

Jack slipped the Great Plains book and his notebook into his leather bag and climbed down.

When he stepped onto the ground, the grass came all the way up to his chest. It tickled his nose.

“Ah-ah-CHOO!” he sneezed.

“Let’s go swimming in the grass ocean,” said Annie.

She started off with Teddy under her arm.

The wind blew gently as Jack hurried after her. All he could see was rolling waves of grass.

They walked and walked and walked. Finally, they stopped to rest.

“We could walk for months and never see anything but grass,” said Jack.

Arf! Arf!

“Teddy says there’s something great up ahead,” said Annie.

“You can’t tell what he’s saying,” said Jack. “He’s just barking.”

“I can tell,” said Annie. “Trust me.”

“We can’t walk all day,” said Jack.

“Come on,” said Annie. “Just a little farther.” She started walking again.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But he kept going through the tall, rippling grass. They went down a small slope, then up a small rise. At the top of the rise, Jack froze.

“Wow, that is great,” he whispered.

“Told you,” said Annie.

3. Black Hawk

Jack stared at a circle of tepees ahead. Busy people in buckskins moved about the circle. Horses and ponies grazed nearby.

Jack took out their research book and found a picture of the tepees.

He read:

In the early 1800s, many different Native American tribes lived on the Great Plains. The Lakota were the largest tribe. They lived mostly in the areas we now call North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.



Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



Behind Jack and Annie, a horse neighed.

They turned. A horse and rider were heading toward the tepee camp.



The sun was very bright behind the rider. Jack could only see the outline of a body with a bow and a quiver of arrows on his back.

Jack quickly flipped through the book. He found a picture of a man on horseback carrying a bow and arrows. Below the picture it said LAKOTA WARRIOR.

Jack read:

Everything changed for the Native Americans of the Great Plains after white settlers arrived in the mid-1800s. Fighting broke out between Lakota warriors and white soldiers. By the end of the 1800s, the Lakota were defeated. They lost both their land and their old way of life.



Jack looked back at the rider. The warrior was coming closer.

“Get down,” he whispered.

“Why?” said Annie.

“This might be a time when the Indians are fighting with the settlers,” said Jack.

The grass rustled as the warrior passed by them. His horse neighed again.

Arf! Arf!

“Shh!” whispered Jack.

But it was too late. The warrior had heard Teddy’s barking. He galloped toward them, grabbing his bow.

“Wait!” shouted Jack. He jumped up from the grass. “We come in peace!”

The rider halted.

Now Jack saw that he was only a boy on a pony. He couldn’t have been more than ten or eleven.

“Hey, you’re just a kid,” Annie said, smiling.

The boy didn’t smile back. But he did lower his bow while he stared at Annie.

“What’s your name?” she asked.

“Black Hawk,” he said.

“Cool name,” said Annie. “We’re Jack and Annie. We’re just visiting. We live in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

Black Hawk nodded. Then he turned his pony around and started toward the Lakota camp.

“Hey, can we come with you?” called Annie.

Black Hawk looked back.

“Yes,” he said. “Meet my people.”

“You mean your parents?” asked Annie.

“No, they died long ago,” said Black Hawk. “I live with my grandmother.”

“Oh, I’d like to meet your grandmother,” said Annie. “I’m going to see my grandmother today, too.”

Black Hawk nudged his pony forward again. Annie followed with Teddy.

Jack didn’t move.

What if the Lakota are at war with the white settlers? he worried. What if they think we’re enemies?

“Annie!” Jack called softly. “We don’t know if it’s safe or not!”

But Annie just waved for him to come on.

Jack sighed. He opened the research book and quickly flipped through the pages. He wanted information about how to act with the Lakota.

On one page, he read:

Good manners to the Lakota mean speaking as few words as possible and sharing gifts when visiting.



On another page, he read:

The Lakota admire those who do not show fear.



Jack’s favorite piece of information was:

Holding up two fingers means “friend.”



Jack put the book away. He ran to catch up with Annie.

Annie was telling Black Hawk all about their grandmother. The boy listened silently.

“Annie,” Jack whispered. “I just read that it’s good manners to be quiet. And we should give gifts and not show fear. Also, holding up two fingers means ‘friend.’ ”

Annie nodded.

“Got that?” said Jack.

“Sure,” she said. “No talking, no fear, no problem.”

Jack looked up. He caught his breath.

Ahead of them, the people at the campsite had stopped what they were doing. All eyes were turned to Jack and Annie.

Jack quickly held up two fingers. Annie did the same.

OceanofPDF.com



4. Good Manners

Black Hawk led Jack and Annie toward the tepees. Everyone kept watching them.

Jack couldn’t tell what anyone was thinking. No one looked angry. But no one looked happy, either.

Jack wondered how to appear brave.

He glanced at Annie. She walked tall and straight. Her chin was up. Her face was calm.

Jack straightened his shoulders. He lifted his chin, and he felt braver.

Black Hawk stopped and slid off his pony. The pony headed for the grazing pasture.

Then Black Hawk led them to a tepee. It was covered with buffalo designs.

“Grandmother is inside,” Black Hawk said to Jack and Annie.

Inside, the tepee looked like a small round room. A fire burned in the center. Smoke rose through a hole at the top.

An old woman sat on animal skins. She was sewing beads onto a moccasin.

She looked up at Jack and Annie.

“Grandmother,” said Black Hawk. “This is Jack and Annie from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

Jack and Annie both held up two fingers for “friend.”

Grandmother raised two fingers also.

Then Jack took off his coonskin cap. He gave it to Grandmother.

She put the cap on her head, then laughed. Jack and Annie laughed, too.

Grandmother’s laughter and kind face reminded Jack of his own grandmother.

“You wish to learn our ways,” she said.

Jack and Annie nodded. Jack could tell she was wise.

Grandmother stood and left the tepee. They followed her.

Outside, everyone was busy again. They all seemed to know that Jack and Annie weren’t enemies.

Jack looked around the camp.

Men and boys carved bows. Women and girls pounded meat and sewed clothes. One girl was adding claws to a buckskin shirt.

“The bear claws will give her the strength of the bear,” said Grandmother. “She will sew on hawk feathers, elk teeth, and porcupine quills, too. All will give her the power of the animals.”

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“I have strong animal power when I go on a buffalo hunt,” Black Hawk said proudly.

“What do you mean?” asked Jack.

“I will show you,” said Black Hawk. “Wait.”

Black Hawk went back inside the tepee.

Annie turned to Grandmother.

“Why does he hunt the buffalo?” she asked.



“The buffalo gives our people many gifts,” said the old woman. “Food from his body. Tepees from his skin, tools from his bones.”

Jack started making a list.

“Cups from his horns,” Grandmother went on. “Ropes from his hair. Even winter sleds from his ribs.”

Jack finished his list.



“That reminds me of the seal hunter in the Arctic,” said Annie. “He used all the gifts from the seal’s body. He didn’t waste a thing.”

Just then, Teddy began growling and barking.

Jack and Annie turned around. They both gasped.

Coming out of Grandmother’s tepee was a huge wolf!

5. Sunlight and Midnight

The wolf had yellow eyes and sharp teeth.

Teddy snarled and barked. Annie rushed forward to grab the little dog.

Suddenly the wolf stood up on its hind legs!

“Yikes!” said Annie.

She leaped back.

Then she and Jack started to laugh.

The fierce wolf was Black Hawk wearing a wolf’s hide! His head came out through a slit near the wolf’s neck. He gave Jack and Annie a little smile.

“That’s a great wolf suit,” said Annie.

“Why do you wear that?” asked Jack.

“The wolf is the most powerful hunter of the buffalo,” said Black Hawk. “When I wear his skin, I feel his strength.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

Black Hawk looked at his grandmother.

“May I show them the buffalo now?” he said.

“Only show,” said Grandmother. “Do not hunt. We have enough meat today.”

She looked back at Jack and Annie.

“Lakota never take more buffalo than we need,” she said.

“That’s good,” said Annie.

Black Hawk handed his wolf skin to Grandmother. Then he ran to the grazing ponies.

He climbed on his. Then he herded two ponies, one black and one yellow, over to Jack and Annie.

“Hi, Midnight. Hi, Sunlight,” said Annie, naming the ponies. She patted their noses.

“Annie,” whispered Jack. “How are we going to ride without saddles or reins?”

“Just hold on to their manes,” she said, “and grip with your legs. Watch.”

Annie threw her arms around Midnight’s neck. She slung her leg over the pony’s back and pulled herself up.

“I’ll carry Teddy in the bag,” Annie said.

Jack picked up Teddy and slipped him inside the leather bag. He handed it to Annie, who hung it over her shoulder. Teddy’s head peeked out of the bag.

Arf! he barked.

“Giddy-up, Midnight!” said Annie. The pony started to walk away.

“Wait—” said Jack.

He turned to Black Hawk. He had just a few questions.

Black Hawk let out a wild whoop and took off, too.

Jack took a deep breath. He threw his arms around Sunlight’s neck. Then he slung his leg over the pony’s back.

The pony started to move!

“Wait—wait!” said Jack. He hopped on one foot, trying to keep up.

The pony stopped.

Slowly, Jack pulled himself onto Sunlight’s back. He gripped the pony’s mane. Then he carefully reached up and pushed his glasses into place.

He looked over his shoulder. Grandmother was watching.

She nodded at him.

Lakota people admire those who do not show fear, Jack remembered.

He liked Grandmother. He wanted her to admire him. He let out a wild whoop, and Sunlight took off like the wind.

The whoop made Jack feel braver.

He held tightly to Sunlight’s mane. They caught up with Black Hawk and Annie, and together they all rode through the tall grass.



Shadows of clouds swept over the plains. They looked like giant dark birds spreading their wings.

Black Hawk’s pony stopped at the top of a grassy slope. Sunlight and Midnight halted right behind him.

Jack couldn’t believe his eyes.

Before them were thousands and thousands of grazing buffalo.

6. Stampede!

“Wow,” whispered Jack and Annie together.

Black Hawk looked silently at the grazing buffalo.

“Hand me the research book,” said Jack.

Annie lifted Teddy out of the bag. Then she slid the book out and gave it to Jack.

He found a picture of a buffalo herd. He read to himself.

The true name of the buffalo is “bison.” At the beginning of the 1800s, there were 40 million bison on the Great Plains. One hundred years later, there were less than 300. Almost all had been killed by white hunters and soldiers.



Jack looked back at the vast herd. As far as he could see, there was nothing but buffalo.



Now Jack knew for certain they’d come to the time before the white settlers and soldiers had arrived, before the end of the great buffalo herds.

“I have been on many hunts,” Black Hawk said, his eyes still on the buffalo.

“Were you scared?” said Jack.

Black Hawk shook his head.

“You’re really brave,” said Annie.

Black Hawk smiled proudly.

“I will show you how a brave hunter moves,” he said.

He slid off his pony.

“Wait, your grandmother said not to hunt,” said Annie. “Plus, you don’t have your wolf suit.”

“I am not afraid,” said Black Hawk.

“I don’t think you should go down there,” said Jack. “There’s no grownups around.”

But Black Hawk wasn’t listening.

He began creeping on all fours toward the buffalo.

“I have a feeling something bad is going to happen,” said Annie.

Jack had the same feeling. He looked back at the book.

A bison can weigh two thousand pounds and stand six feet high. If one becomes alarmed by a hunter, he might start running and set off a terrifying stampede.



Jack looked back at Black Hawk. He was creeping closer and closer to the herd.

Jack’s heart pounded. He wanted to shout, Come back! But he didn’t want to scare any of the huge, fierce-looking animals.

Keeping his eyes on Black Hawk, Jack handed the plains book to Annie. She slid it back into the bag beside Teddy.

Black Hawk stopped just as he was passing the nearest buffalo. His eyes squeezed shut. His nose wrinkled up. His mouth opened.

“What’s he doing?” asked Jack.

“Ah-ah-CHOO!” Black Hawk sneezed.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie.

The huge buffalo jerked its head up. It made a low, moaning sound. Then it pointed its horns and charged!

“Watch out!” cried Jack.

Black Hawk threw himself out of the way of the charging buffalo.



A ripple went through the herd as other shaggy animals looked up.

Suddenly, Teddy jumped out of Annie’s arms. He landed in the tall grass and ran toward the buffalo.

“Teddy!” shouted Annie.

The dog tore down the hill. He bounded along the edge of the herd, barking furiously.

“Teddy, come back!” cried Annie.

She slid off her pony and ran after Teddy.

Jack tried to see Black Hawk.

The boy was still dodging the running buffalo. He looked tired.

Jack took a deep breath.

“Go to Black Hawk!” he said, nudging Sunlight with his knees.

The golden pony charged down the slope. He ran between the buffalo.

“Black Hawk!” Jack shouted.

Black Hawk started running toward Sunlight. The buffalo swerved behind him.

Sunlight slowed as Black Hawk got near. The boy threw himself over the golden pony’s back. He held on to Jack as Sunlight veered away from the buffalo and ran back up the slope.

“Where’s Annie?” Jack cried as they reached the top.

“There!” said Black Hawk, pointing.

Annie was surrounded by buffalo—calm buffalo. She was patting them and talking to them. The buffalo near her had stopped running, too.

The ones beyond those started to calm down … then others … until all the buffalo had stopped running. They began grazing again as if nothing had happened.

7. White Buffalo Woman

“She has good medicine,” said Black Hawk.

“Annie doesn’t have any medicine,” Jack said. “She just has a way with animals.”

Black Hawk was silent. He climbed back on his waiting pony. Then he rode down toward Annie.

Jack followed. Annie’s pony trailed behind.

Annie turned to Jack and Black Hawk as they rode up to her. On her face was a look of amazement.

“You wouldn’t believe what happened!” she said.

“You stopped the stampede,” said Black Hawk.

“But it wasn’t just me,” said Annie.

“What do you mean?” asked Jack.

“I was trying to find Teddy,” said Annie, “and I got in the way of the buffalo. I couldn’t escape. So I held up my hands and shouted, ‘Stop!’ Then, out of nowhere, a beautiful lady in a white leather dress came to help me.”

“You saw a lady in white?” asked Black Hawk. His eyes had grown wide.

“Yes!” said Annie. “She held up her hands, and the buffalo stopped running. Then she disappeared.”

“Where’s Teddy?” said Jack.

Annie gasped.

“I don’t know! I forgot about him!” she said. “Teddy! Teddy!”

Arf! Arf!

The little dog came bounding out of the grass toward them.

Annie scooped him up. Teddy licked her face all over.

“Where did you go?” Annie asked him. “Did you see the beautiful lady, too?”

“That lady does not live on this earth,” Black Hawk said softly.

“What do you mean?” said Annie.

“You saw the spirit of White Buffalo Woman,” he said.

“What do you mean, spirit?” said Jack. “You mean like a ghost?”

Black Hawk turned his pony around.



“Let us go back,” he said. “We must tell Grandmother.”

Annie put Teddy in Jack’s bag. Then she climbed on her pony, and they took off.

Behind them, the buffalo grazed peacefully on the plains.

8. Sacred Circle

The sun was going down as the three ponies galloped for home. The deep blue sky was streaked with golden red light.

Back at the Lakota camp, the circle of tepees glowed in the setting sun. People were gathered around a large fire.

Black Hawk led Jack and Annie to the camp. They got off their ponies and went over to the fire.

Grandmother rose to greet them.

“You have been gone a long time,” she said.

Black Hawk looked her bravely in the eye.

“Grandmother, I tried to hunt the buffalo alone,” he said. “One charged at me, but Jack saved my life. Then Annie and White Buffalo Woman stopped all the other buffalo from a stampede.”

“Let this be a lesson to you,” Grandmother said sternly. “Your pride led you to show off. Showing off made you behave foolishly. Your foolishness frightened a buffalo. He frightened others. One thing always leads to another. Everything is related.”

“I am sorry,” said Black Hawk. He hung his head. “I have learned.”

Jack felt sorry for Black Hawk.

“I make mistakes sometimes, too,” he said softly.

“Me too,” said Annie.

Grandmother looked at Jack and Annie.

“Buffalo Girl and Rides-Like-Wind showed great courage today,” she said.

Jack smiled. He loved his new Lakota name: Rides-Like-Wind.

“We welcome you to our family,” said Grandmother.

The evening shadows spread over the camp. Someone began beating a drum. It sounded like a heartbeat.

“Come, sit with us in our circle,” said Grandmother.

They sat with her near the warm fire. A cool breeze blew sparks into the gray twilight.

An old man held a long pipe up to the sky. He pointed it to the east, the south, the west, and the north.

Then he passed the pipe to the next man in the circle. The man put the pipe to his lips and blew smoke into the golden firelight. Then he passed it on.



“The smoke from the sacred pipe joins all things to the Great Spirit,” Grandmother said to Jack and Annie.

“The Great Spirit?” asked Annie.

“The Great Spirit is the source of all things in the sacred circle of life,” said Grandmother. “It is the source of all spirits.”

“What spirits?” asked Jack.

“There are many,” said Grandmother. “Wind spirits, tree spirits, bird spirits. Sometimes they can be seen. Sometimes not.”

“What about the White Buffalo Woman?” said Jack. “Who is she?”

“She is a messenger of the Great Spirit,” said Grandmother. “He sent her when the people were starving. She brought the sacred pipe so that our prayers could rise to the Great Spirit. He answers by sending us the buffalo.”

“Why do you think White Buffalo Woman came to me?” asked Annie.

“Sometimes courage can summon help from the beyond,” Grandmother said.

She pulled a brown-and-white feather from a small buckskin bag.

She put the feather on the ground in front of Jack and Annie.

“This is a gift for you,” she said. “An eagle’s feather for your courage.”



Arf! Arf! Teddy wagged his tail.

Jack and Annie smiled at each other. The eagle’s feather was their “gift from the prairie blue.”

Their mission was complete.

The chanting and drumbeats grew louder and louder. Then they stopped.

The old man held the pipe up to the sky.

“All things are related,” he said.

The pipe-smoking ceremony was over.

The sky was dark and filled with stars.

One by one, people rose from the circle and went to their tepees.

Jack put the eagle’s feather in his bag and yawned.

“We better go home now,” he said.

“You must rest first,” said Grandmother. “You can leave in the dawn.”

“Good plan,” said Annie. She was yawning, too.

They went with Grandmother and Black Hawk to their tepee.

Grandmother pointed to two buffalo robes that lay to one side of the still-burning fire. Jack and Annie stretched out on them. Teddy snuggled between them.

Grandmother and Black Hawk lay on robes across from them.

Jack watched as the bluish white smoke rose from the fire. It went up through the tepee hole and into the endless starry sky.

Jack listened to the wind blowing through the grass: Shh—shh—shh.

It’s the voice of the Great Plains, he thought. Then he drifted off to sleep.

9. Lakota School

Jack felt Teddy licking his cheek.

He opened his eyes. Gray light came through the smoke hole.

The fire was out. The tepee was empty.

Jack jumped up. He grabbed his bag and hurried outside with Teddy.

In the cool light before dawn, everyone was taking down their tepees. They were loading them onto wooden platforms strapped to two poles. The poles were pulled by horses.

Grandmother and Black Hawk piled tools and clothes onto their platform.

Annie stuffed buffalo meat into a rawhide bag.

“What’s happening?” Jack asked.

“It is time to follow the buffalo,” said Grandmother. “We will camp somewhere else for a few weeks.”

Jack pulled out his notebook. He still had many questions. But he tried to choose just a few.

“Can you camp anywhere?” he asked. “Even when you don’t own the land?”

Black Hawk laughed.

“People cannot own land,” he said. “The land belongs to the Great Spirit.”

Jack wrote in his notebook:



“What about school?” said Jack. “Don’t you have to go to school?”

“What is school?” Black Hawk said.

“It’s a place where kids go to learn things,” Jack explained.

Black Hawk laughed again.

“There is not only one place to learn,” he said. “In camp we learn to make clothes, tools, and tepees. On the plains we learn to ride and hunt. We look at the sky and learn courage from the eagle.”

Jack wrote:



Grandmother turned to Jack and Annie.

“Will you walk with us toward the sunset?” she asked.

Jack shook his head.

“We have to go the other way,” he said, “toward the sunrise.”

“Thank you for the eagle’s feather,” said Annie.

“Let your thoughts rise as high as that feather,” said Grandmother. “It is good medicine.”

“What does that mean?” Jack asked. “Good medicine?”

“Good medicine connects you to the world of the spirits,” she said.

Jack nodded. But he still didn’t really understand.

“Good-bye, Buffalo Girl and Rides-Like-Wind,” said Grandmother. “We wish you a safe journey.”

Jack and Annie waved. Then they started walking back the way they’d come.

Teddy ran ahead of them.

At the top of the rise, they looked back.



Grandmother, Black Hawk, and the rest of the tribe were watching.

Jack and Annie both held up two fingers for “friend.” Then they took off down the slope.

They ran across the prairie … through the tall, whispering grass … all the way back to the tree house.

Annie put Teddy in the leather bag. She and Jack climbed up the rope ladder.

They looked out the window one last time. The ocean of grass was golden in the early sunlight.

By now, the Lakota are walking west, Jack thought.

“Soon everything will change,” he said sadly. “The buffalo will vanish. The old way of life for the Lakota will vanish, too.”

“But the Great Spirit won’t ever vanish,” said Annie. “It will always take care of Black Hawk’s people.”

Jack smiled. Annie’s words made him feel better.

Arf, arf! Teddy barked, as if to say Let’s go!

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He picked up the Pennsylvania book and pointed at a picture of Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go home to our people,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. Good Medicine

“We’re home,” said Annie.

Bright sunlight flooded the tree house. Teddy licked Jack’s and Annie’s faces. They were back in their jeans and T-shirts.

“Hey, silly,” Annie said to the dog. “Now we have the second thing to help free you from your spell.”

She took the eagle’s feather out of Jack’s backpack. She put it on Morgan’s note, next to the silver pocket watch from the Titanic.

“Now we have our gift from the prairie blue,” said Jack. “Let your thoughts rise as high as this feather.”

“Hey, I just had a thought!” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“I bet Teddy had something to do with White Buffalo Woman,” she said.

“Why?” asked Jack.

“One second Teddy disappeared in the grass. Then White Buffalo Woman appeared,” said Annie. “When White Buffalo Woman disappeared, Teddy appeared.”

“Hmm … ” said Jack. He stared at the little dog.

Teddy tilted his head and gave Jack a wise look.

“Well … ” said Jack, “maybe Teddy has good medicine.”

“Now you understand,” said Annie, smiling.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” A call came from the distance.

Jack and Annie looked out the window of the tree house.

Their mom and their grandmother were standing on their porch.

“Yay, Grandmother’s here!” said Annie.

“We’re coming!” they shouted together.

“Let’s put Teddy in your backpack,” said Annie. “So we can take him home with us this time.”

“Okay,” said Jack.

But when they turned around, the little dog was gone.

“Teddy?” said Annie.

There was no sign of him.

“Oh, man, as soon as we turned our backs, he slipped away,” said Jack. “Just like last time.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “He’ll find us again soon. I’m sure of it.” She started down the rope ladder.

Jack grabbed his pack and followed.

As they started for home, a wind gusted through the trees.

Jack stopped for a moment to look at the woods.

Branches waved their leaves.

Birds left the branches and swooped up into the blue sky.

Black Hawk’s grandmother is right, he thought. All things are related.

“Jack!” called Annie.

“Coming!” said Jack.

He hurried to catch up with her.

Together they ran out of the Frog Creek woods … up their street … and into their own grandmother’s arms.

The Legend Of White Buffalo Woman



Long ago, when the Lakota had no game to hunt, a beautiful woman in white buckskins appeared. She gave the chief of the tribe a special pipe. It had a buffalo carved on its round bowl and eagle feathers hanging from its long wooden stem.

White Buffalo Woman told the chief that the smoke from the sacred pipe would carry prayers to the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit would answer by helping the Lakota find buffalo to hunt.

White Buffalo Woman also said that the pipe smoke would join all living things to the Lakota tribe.

The pipe bowl represented the earth.

The buffalo carved upon it represented all four-legged animals that live upon the earth.

The pipe’s wooden stem represented all that grows on the earth.

The twelve eagle feathers hanging from it represented all the winged creatures.

As White Buffalo Woman walked away from the tribe, she turned into a white buffalo calf—one of the rarest animals of all.





The legend of White Buffalo Woman has been handed down from generation to generation by Lakota people.

MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





1) The Lakota tribe has also been called the Sioux.

2) Today most Lakota live on reservations in North and South Dakota. (“Reservations” are areas of land reserved for Native Americans by the U.S. government.) Lakota parents and grandparents still pass on the traditional beliefs of their people to their children.

3) The true name of the buffalo is bison. Bison came to North America during the Ice Age and at one time were the biggest group of large mammals on the continent.

4) In the 1800s, the U.S. Army was at war with the Native Americans of the plains. They knew the Native American way of life could not survive without the bison. So they decided to kill all the herds. In the years that followed, millions of bison were killed until there were only a few hundred left.

5) In the early 1900s, many people were upset by the killing of the bison. They asked the government to help save these animals. Captive bison were sent to Yellowstone National Park and protected from hunters. Almost 2,500 bison live there today.

Jack and Annie walked past the Frog Creek woods on their way home from the library.

“I miss Teddy,” said Annie.

“Me, too,” said Jack.

“He’s a really smart dog,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and brave.”

“And wise,” said Annie.

“And funny,” said Jack.

“And here!” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“Here!” Annie pointed at the Frog Creek woods.

A small dog with tan-colored fur was peeking out from the bushes.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Oh, wow! Teddy!” said Jack.

The little dog ran off into the woods.

“Let’s go!” said Annie.

She and Jack raced after Teddy. The Frog Creek woods glowed with late afternoon sunlight.



The dog ran between the trees and finally stopped at a rope ladder. It hung from the tallest oak tree and led up to the magic tree house.

Teddy waited for Jack and Annie to catch up. He panted and wagged his tail.

“Hi, you!” cried Annie. She picked up the little dog and hugged him. “We missed you!”

“Yeah, silly!” said Jack. He kissed Teddy. Teddy licked his face.

“Is it time to get our third gift?” asked Annie.

Teddy sneezed, as if to say, Of course!

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack put Teddy inside his backpack and followed.

They climbed into the tree house. There was the note from Morgan le Fay. It was on the floor, just where it had been two days ago.

Jack let Teddy out of his pack.

Annie picked up the note and read:


This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:


A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.


Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

Morgan


Jack touched the first two gifts, which they had already gotten: a pocket watch from the Titanic and an eagle’s feather from the Lakota Indians of the Great Plains.

“Now we have to get the gift from a forest far away,” said Annie.

“I wonder how far away?” said Jack.

“I know how to find out,” said Annie. “Where’s our book?”

She and Jack looked around the tree house for one of the research books that Morgan always left them.

Arf! Arf! Teddy pawed a book in the corner.

Jack picked it up and read the title: Wildlife of India.

“Oh, man. India,” he said. “That’s very far away.”

“Let’s get going,” said Annie, “so we can free Teddy.”

Jack pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

But only for a moment …

Dear Readers,

Years ago, I spent several months in India and found it to be a spectacularly colorful and interesting country. So it was a great joy for me to go back there in my imagination as I worked on Tigers at Twilight.

I also did research closer to home. To learn more about tigers, I visited the world-famous Bronx Zoo, in New York City. There I saw some magnificent tigers, and I learned that tigers are in danger of disappearing from the earth because so many are being killed by poachers. Many great zoos around the country help educate people about the need to protect wild animals.

As I wrote this book, the plight of the tiger greatly touched my heart. I hope it will touch yours, too. I also hope that people around the world will work together quickly to save these fierce and beautiful animals.

All my best,

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright

In the forests of the night;

What immortal hand or eye

Could frame thy fearful symmetry?





In what distant deeps or skies

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?

On what wings dare he aspire?

What the hand dare seize the fire?





—From The Tyger by William Blake, 1794

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free an enchanted dog from a spell. They have already received a gift on a trip to the Titanic and a gift from the Lakota Indians. Now they are about to set out in search of the third gift …



1. How Far Away?



Jack and Annie walked past the Frog Creek woods on their way home from the library.

“I miss Teddy,” said Annie.

“Me, too,” said Jack.

“He’s a really smart dog,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and brave.”

“And wise,” said Annie.

“And funny,” said Jack.

“And here!” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“Here!” Annie pointed at the Frog Creek woods.

A small dog with tan-colored fur was peeking out from the bushes.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Oh, wow! Teddy!” said Jack.

The little dog ran off into the woods.

“Let’s go!” said Annie.

She and Jack raced after Teddy. The Frog Creek woods glowed with late afternoon sunlight.



The dog ran between the trees and finally stopped at a rope ladder. It hung from the tallest oak tree and led up to the magic tree house.

Teddy waited for Jack and Annie to catch up. He panted and wagged his tail.

“Hi, you!” cried Annie. She picked up the little dog and hugged him. “We missed you!”

“Yeah, silly!” said Jack. He kissed Teddy. Teddy licked his face.

“Is it time to get our third gift?” asked Annie.

Teddy sneezed, as if to say, Of course!

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack put Teddy inside his backpack and followed.

They climbed into the tree house. There was the note from Morgan le Fay. It was on the floor, just where it had been two days ago.

Jack let Teddy out of his pack.

Annie picked up the note and read:


This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:





A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.





Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

Morgan



Jack touched the first two gifts, which they had already gotten: a pocket watch from the Titanic and an eagle’s feather from the Lakota Indians of the Great Plains.

“Now we have to get the gift from a forest far away,” said Annie.

“I wonder how far away?” said Jack.

“I know how to find out,” said Annie. “Where’s our book?”

She and Jack looked around the tree house for one of the research books that Morgan always left them.

Arf! Arf! Teddy pawed a book in the corner.

Jack picked it up and read the title: Wildlife of India.

“Oh, man. India,” he said. “That’s very far away.”

“Let’s get going,” said Annie, “so we can free Teddy.”

Jack pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

But only for a moment …

2. Kah and Ko

The warm air burst with sound.

Kah-ko!

Eee-eee!

Akkk-awkk!

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

He and Annie looked out the window.

The sky was lit by an orange glow as the sun went down.

The tree house was in a tree by a stream at the edge of a forest.

The wild screeching and cawing came from the forest’s tall, leafy trees.

Just then, two creatures leaped onto the windowsill.

“Aaah!” Jack and Annie yelled, jumping back.

Annie burst out laughing.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

Two small monkeys peered at them. Their dark faces were framed with light gray fur. They looked as if they were wearing tiny parkas.

“Hi,” said Annie. “I’m Annie. He’s Jack. And he’s Teddy. What are your names?”

Kah-ko, kah-ko, the monkeys chattered.

“Cool,” said Annie. She turned to Jack. “Her name is Kah. His name is Ko.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.



“I bet he is her brother,” said Annie.

Kah and Ko whooped as if laughing at Annie’s joke. Their yellow eyes twinkled.

“We came to get a gift from the forest,” said Annie. “Do you know where we can find it?”

The monkeys nodded and chattered. Then they started down the tree.

Using their long tails and arms, they swung from branch to branch. They jumped to the ground and looked up.

“Coming! Bring Teddy, Jack,” Annie said. Then she started down the ladder.

Jack quickly flipped through Wildlife of India. He found a picture of the gray monkeys. He read:

This monkey is called a langur (say lun-GOOR). The word langur means “having a long tail.”



Jack pulled his notebook and pencil out of his backpack. He wrote:



Annie’s laughter came from below. It blended with the sounds of the forest.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He put the book, his notebook, and Teddy into his pack. Then he hurried down the ladder.

Annie was playing with the langurs on the stream bank.

Jack put Teddy on the ground.

Kah bounded over to Jack and grabbed his hand. The langur’s paw felt like a tiny human hand.

Kah pulled Jack toward the forest. Ko pulled Annie, and Teddy scampered after them.

The langurs climbed the huge, leafy trees. Then they began swinging from branch to branch, like kids on a jungle gym.

Annie dashed beneath the swinging monkeys. Teddy ran after her.

“Wait, wait!” Jack called, hurrying after them all. “Annie, slow down! We don’t know anything about this place.”

The langurs slowed down, as if they understood Jack’s words. Jack caught up with Annie. They walked on through the forest.

“This is so amazing,” said Annie.

Jack agreed.

The sunset gave the trees a fiery glow.

The hot air smelled sweet.



Blue peacocks spread their tails.

Yellow birds flew from tree to tree.

Small deer ate red flowers in a clearing.

“It’s like paradise,” said Annie.

“Yeah, but don’t forget the title of our book: Wildlife of India,” said Jack. “ ‘Wildlife’ means scary animals, too.”

Jack noticed long, deep gashes in a tree as they walked by. He stopped.

“What happened there?” he said.

Annie shrugged and kept walking.

Jack pulled the book out of his pack. There was a picture of a tree with gashes.

He read aloud:

Tigers sharpen their claws on tree trunks. They leave big gashes in the bark.



“What?” said Annie. She stopped and looked back at the tree.

“See what I mean?” said Jack. “Tigers live here. And one of them just came this way.”

3. Life or Death

“Tigers?” said Annie. “Cool.”

Jack read more:

A wild tiger eats almost 5,000 pounds of fresh raw meat a year.



“Oh, not so cool,” said Annie. Jack went on:

Tigers usually leave elephants alone. And like many smaller cats, tigers often avoid wild dogs.



Teddy growled.

“Wild dogs, not a shrimp like you,” Jack said to Teddy. “A tiger would eat you in a minute.”

Teddy growled again.

Just then, Kah and Ko began hooting. Koo-koo-koo!

The peacocks cried Kok! Kok!

The small deer made short barking sounds and stamped their hooves.

“What’s going on?” said Annie.

“We better put Teddy in my pack,” said Jack, “to keep him safe.”

Jack slipped the dog into his pack. Teddy’s head poked out the top.

“All set?” Jack asked the little dog.

Teddy growled again.

This time, a deep, fierce growl answered back. It seemed to surround them.

Jack’s hair stood on end.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“A tiger!” said Jack.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

Kah and Ko screeched at Jack and Annie from their tree.

“They want us to join them!” said Annie. “Come on!” She grabbed a branch and climbed up.

Jack’s hands were shaking as he put his backpack on. He grabbed a branch and pushed off the ground. He pulled himself into the tree.

Another growl shook the forest.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

Koo-koo-koo! The langurs climbed higher up the tree.

Jack and Annie followed them, climbing from branch to branch.

The sky above was no longer glowing. The bright orange had faded to a twilight gray.

Jack looked down. He couldn’t see the ground at all.

He listened for another scary roar.

Only the cries of frightened forest creatures filled the air.

“Maybe the tiger’s gone,” said Annie.

Jack glanced at Kah and Ko. The langurs cuddled together. Their dark faces looked worried.

“And maybe not,” said Jack.

“How can we get through the forest without running into him?” said Annie.

“That’s a problem,” said Jack. “And it’s getting dark. Soon we won’t be able to see anything.”

Kah and Ko hooted again. They pointed down the tree trunk.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack’s pack.

“Do they see the tiger?” Jack asked, his heart thumping again. He couldn’t see anything but leaves and branches.

Then, far below, he saw the tree trunk move!

“A snake!” said Annie.

The snake was slithering around the trunk. It had black-and-tan markings. The snake’s body was as thick as the tree trunk!

“A python,” breathed Jack.

The python kept curling up the tree trunk.

“Is it poisonous?” asked Annie.

Jack pulled out their book. By the last light of day, he found a picture of a python. He read aloud:

The python is not a poisonous snake.



“Whew,” said Annie.

“Not so fast,” said Jack. He read more:

To kill its prey, the python squeezes it to death, then swallows it whole. A python can swallow an animal the size of a full-grown deer.



“Oh, yuck!” said Annie.

“This is more than just yuck, Annie,” said Jack. “This is life or death,”

Kah and Ko chattered at Jack and Annie.

“Not now,” said Jack. “We have to think.”

The langurs grabbed thick vines. They leaned back. Then they jumped out of the tree!



The langurs swung through the air like trapeze artists. They swung over bushes and tall grass and landed in another tree.

They screeched at Jack and Annie and waved their arms.

“I know what they’re saying,” said Annie. “They want us to copy them!”

4. Swing Time

Annie grabbed a vine.

Jack looked back at the python. The giant snake was still winding its way up the tree. It had almost reached their branch.

Jack took a deep breath. Then he grabbed a vine, too.

“Lean back, like Kah and Ko did,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie leaned back.

“One, two, three—go!” said Annie.

They swung out of the tree.

Jack felt his stomach drop. Air rushed by. Leaves and branches slapped at him.

Suddenly, the forest shook with a great roar.

Like a flame, a tiger leaped up from the bushes!

His yellow eyes blazed. His teeth shone like daggers. His claws barely missed Jack and Annie!

“AAAHHH!” they yelled.

The tiger crashed back down into the bushes.

Jack and Annie swung into the langurs’ tree.

Jack threw one leg around the trunk. He let go of his vine and held on tightly to a branch.

“Oh, man!” he said. He was in shock.

The langurs patted him, as if to make sure he was okay.

“Wow, that was fun,” said Annie, sitting on a big branch.

“Fun? Are you nuts?” said Jack.

“The swinging was fun,” said Annie. “The tiger was scary.”

Just then, the tree began to shake. Branches snapped below.

“Oh, no!” said Jack.

“Can tigers climb trees?” asked Annie.

“Probably,” said Jack. He hugged the trunk and squeezed his eyes shut.

From below came loud sounds of chewing, smacking, and crunching.

Teddy growled.

Jack groaned.

“Now the tiger’s eating the tree,” he said.

Annie burst into laughter.

Kah and Ko whooped as if they were laughing, too.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“What?” said Jack, opening his eyes.

“Look!” Annie pointed at the twilight.

A thick gray tube was waving in the air.

“Another snake?” said Jack, horrified.

“No! An elephant trunk!” said Annie.

The trunk wiggled near Jack and Annie, as if it were sniffing them. Then it picked leaves from the tree and disappeared.



“Let’s go see!” said Annie.

With Teddy still in his backpack, Jack followed Annie down to a lower branch.

They peered out at the twilight forest.

In the gray gloom, they saw a herd of elephants.

One stood beneath their tree, eating leaves. Others munched grass.

“Hey, I’ve got a really cool idea,” said Annie.

5. Night Walk

“Uh-oh,” said Jack. “What is it?”

“I know how to escape the tiger,” said Annie. “Our book said tigers don’t attack elephants, right?”

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“So we should travel through the forest on the back of an elephant,” said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly.

“That is a cool idea,” he said. “But—”

“No buts. I’ll get on first,” said Annie.

She climbed down the tree until she was close to the elephant’s back. She carefully lowered herself off a branch. When her feet rested on the elephant’s back, she let go of the branch. Then she slowly sat down.

The elephant let out a low rumbling sound and shifted her weight.

“Don’t worry, it’s just me,” Annie said softly. She patted the huge creature’s back. “Thanks, Saba.”

“Saba?” said Jack.

“That’s her name,” said Annie. “She just told me.”

“Yeah, right,” said Jack.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“Come on, Jack,” said Annie. “It’s not scary.”

Jack sighed and slowly climbed down the tree. When he was above Saba, he lowered himself off the branch.

He put both feet on the elephant. Then he carefully sat down in front of Annie.



Saba rumbled again.

“Tell her not to worry,” said Annie. “Pat her head.”

“Don’t worry, Saba,” Jack said. He patted the elephant’s head. Her skin was rough and wrinkled.

The elephant curled her trunk back and rested it on Jack’s head.

“Hi,” he said in a small voice.

Saba flapped her ears.

Kah and Ko swung to the ground in front of Saba. They chattered at her. She waved her trunk at them. The langurs began bounding through the forest.

Saba followed.

The rest of the herd followed in line. Saba walked with a calm, rolling motion. Jack felt as if he were riding over ocean waves.

A full moon was rising above the trees.

“Where are we going?” Jack asked.

“Just relax,” said Annie. “Kah and Ko know where to go.”

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack’s backpack.

“You relax, too,” Jack said to the little dog.

Fireflies blinked. The moon lit a path between the trees as the elephants marched on.

From a distance came a low growl.

Is that the tiger? Jack wondered.

The elephants paid no attention. They kept walking through the warm woods. They marched slowly under hanging vines and through misty clearings.

Kah and Ko bounded ahead of them, two moon shadows leading the way.

“We’re going far from the tree house,” said Jack.

“Don’t worry,” Annie said.

Suddenly, a long roar split the night.

A chill went down Jack’s spine.

The roar came again. It turned into a yowling. The yowling turned into steady moaning. It sounded as if the whole forest were moaning.

“That’s a really sad sound,” said Annie sleepily.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

But the elephants all marched on.

Jack rocked in sleepy rhythm with Saba’s walk. He could hear Teddy snoring in his backpack.

Soon Jack’s head rested on Saba’s back. He began drifting in and out of dreams—dreams of rocking in a boat under the dark treetops.

6. Swamp Creature

Caw! Caw!

Awk! Awk! Awk!

Jack slowly came out of his dream. He opened his eyes with a start.

He was surrounded by hazy sunlight.

Where am I? he thought in a panic.

Then he remembered—he was in India, on an elephant’s back!

He sat up. Through the haze, he saw that Saba was standing on a muddy stream bank.

Jack yawned. Where was Annie?

The other elephants were upstream. They sprayed water on each other with their trunks.

Teddy, Kah, and Ko were at the edge of the forest. Teddy sniffed the tall grass. The langurs ate flowers.

“Good morning!” called Annie.

She was sitting on a big black rock downstream. She was barefoot and soaking wet.

“Hi,” said Jack. “How did you get down?”

“Teddy and I slid off Saba into the mud,” said Annie. “Try it. But throw down your sneakers and backpack first.”

Annie went to Saba’s side. Her feet were buried in mud up to her ankles.

Jack threw his things to Annie. Then he patted Saba’s rough, wrinkled skin.

“Thanks for the ride,” he said softly.

The elephant touched him one last time with her trunk.

Jack slid down her side—feet first—and fell into the mud. He caught himself with his hands. They sank into the mud past his wrists. His glasses were spattered, too.

“Wash off in the stream,” Annie said.

She put Jack’s pack and shoes on the rock while Jack waded into the cool water.

He washed the mud off his hands and feet. He rinsed off his glasses. Then he looked around.

Saba had joined the rest of the herd. The elephants looked beautiful in the morning mist.

Everything looked beautiful.

Yellow and blue water birds spread their wings. Mossy hanging vines swayed in the breeze. Huge white flowers floated on top of the stream.

Then Jack saw a strange sight. It looked like a horn and two ears sticking out of the water. One ear flicked away a fly.

“There’s a weird creature out here,” he called to Annie. “It looks like it has a horn.”

Annie waded into the stream.

“I better check the book,” said Jack.

He hurried to his pack, wiping his wet hands on his T-shirt. He pulled out the India book.

There was a picture of a horn sticking out of the water. He read:

The one-horned rhinoceros, or “rhino,” washes in a forest stream. Rhinos are not usually dangerous. But because they do not see well, they sometimes charge at things by mistake. A loud noise will usually stop them.



Jack felt sorry for the rhinos. Too bad animals can’t wear glasses, he thought. He read more:

The Indian rhino is a very endangered animal. This means that there are not many left. People called poachers kill them and sell their body parts as medicine and good-luck charms.



Jack started to take out his notebook.

Just then, a slurpy, sloshing sound came from the water.

“Whoa!” said Annie.

Jack looked up.

The rhino rose from the stream. He looked like an ancient swamp creature.

“Oh, man!” said Jack.

The rhino peered at Annie with his tiny eyes.

Then he snorted and lowered his head. His horn pointed right at Annie.

“Make a loud noise!” Jack yelled.

Annie clapped her hands and shouted, “We come in peace!”



The rhino stopped. He grunted. Then he sank back into the water.

Annie laughed.

“Whew,” said Jack. “I better take some notes about that big guy.”

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from the edge of the forest.

“And I better get Teddy,” said Annie.

She hurried out of the stream and ran to get the dog. Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“Jack!” shouted Annie. She was racing toward him, with Teddy at her heels. “Come quick!”

“What’s wrong?” he said.

“We found something terrible!” Annie was close to tears. “Really terrible!”

7. Trapped!

Jack threw his things into his pack and followed Annie to the forest edge.

Teddy stayed close to them, whining. Kah and Ko bounced around, chattering nervously.

As Jack got closer, he saw a tiger. The tiger was lying on his side, completely still.

His eyes were closed. His front paw was caught in a trap.

“Is he dead?” said Jack.

“No, he’s still breathing,” Annie said. A tear ran down her cheek. “He’s worn out from struggling. He must have gotten caught last night. That’s the sad sound we heard.”

“What can we do?” said Jack.

“We have to free him!” said Annie. She started toward the tiger.

“Wait! Wait!” Jack grabbed her. “Tigers eat people, you know.” He took a deep breath. “Let’s see what the book says first.”

“Hurry,” said Annie.

Jack opened their India book. He found a chapter called “Tiger Traps.” He read:

Poachers catch Indian tigers with steel traps. This is against the law. After trapping a tiger, they kill it and sell the body parts for money. Like the rhino, the tiger is a very endangered species. If the killing does not end, they both face extinction. Extinction means that someday there may be no Indian tigers or rhinos left on earth.



“Oh, man, we do have to save him,” said Jack.

Under the writing was a picture of a steel trap used to catch tigers. Jack studied it. It looked horrible and deadly.

“Okay,” he said. He showed the picture to Annie. “Here’s the plan. I’ll push down on this part. The trap will spring open. Then you pull his leg out. Got it?”

“Got it,” said Annie. “Sit, Teddy.”

The little dog sat.

The langurs watched silently as Jack and Annie moved closer to the tiger.

He was the most majestic creature Jack had ever seen. His huge head was a dark orange color. He had perfect black-and-white stripes around his wide face.

The leg in the ugly steel trap was bleeding.

Slowly, silently, Jack pushed down the lever.

He raised the bar off the tiger’s leg.

The tiger kept sleeping.

Slowly, silently, Annie freed the tiger’s leg. She stroked his fur gently.

“Get well,” she whispered.

The tiger didn’t move.

Slowly, silently, Jack and Annie stood up.

They turned around. They started tiptoeing back toward the langurs.

Koo-koo-koo! warned Kah and Ko.



Jack and Annie turned back.

The tiger was on his feet. He stared right at them. His eyes seemed to glow.

Jack looked about wildly. How could they escape?

The tiger snarled at Jack and Annie.

Then slowly, silently, he started toward them.

8. Wonder Dog


The huge tiger limped closer and closer to Jack and Annie.

Jack clapped his hands.

“We come in peace!” he shouted.

But the tiger didn’t turn away. His eyes blazed. His lip curled.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked fiercely at Annie.

“Teddy says run and hide!” said Annie.

She grabbed Jack’s hand and pulled him over to the bank.

“Wait—what about Teddy?” he cried.

“Don’t worry!” Annie said.

She pulled Jack down behind the black rock.

“What about Teddy?” Jack asked again.

“He’s okay—he told me!” said Annie.

Jack heard Teddy’s barks turn to fierce growls.

ARF! ARF! GRRR! GRRRR!

The growls grew louder and louder.



“That doesn’t sound like Teddy,” said Jack.

Then suddenly, there was silence. A strange silence.

“Teddy?” Annie asked. Now she sounded worried.

Annie raised her head. She and Jack both peered over the rock.

Teddy stood tall and brave in the grass.

The tiger was limping away. He disappeared between the trees.

All the forest seemed to hold its breath—until Annie broke the silence.

“Teddy, you’re a wonder dog!” she said.

The langurs clapped and jumped up and down.

Arf! Arf! Teddy was just like a small scruffy dog again. He wagged his tail and ran to Annie and Jack.

Annie scooped him into her arms.

“You saved us!” she said.

“How did you drive away that tiger?” asked Jack, rubbing Teddy’s head. “Did you turn into a wild dog?”

Teddy just panted and licked them both.

Jack pushed his glasses into place and looked back at the forest.

“Well, I guess we won’t be getting a thank-you gift from that tiger,” he said.

Annie laughed.

“I guess not,” she said. “I wonder where our gift is.”

“And I wonder where the tree house is,” said Jack.

Kah and Ko chattered at Jack. Then they bounded down the bank, waving their arms.

“They want us to follow them again,” said Annie. “Come on.”

She and Jack grabbed their things off the rock. They hurried down the stream after the langurs.

The water shimmered in the early light. Silver fish leaped into the air.

Teddy bounded ahead with Kah and Ko. Soon they disappeared around a bend.

Jack and Annie followed them.

When they went around the bend, they saw a man sitting cross-legged on a rock. The langurs sat close to him.

The man’s eyes were closed.

He had long white hair and a long white beard. His skin was brown.

He looked very peaceful.

9. The Hermit

Kah and Ko smoothed the man’s hair with their little paws and patted his cheeks gently.

The man smiled and whispered to the langurs. His eyes stayed closed.

Teddy walked up to the man and licked his hands.

The man still didn’t open his eyes. But he stroked Teddy’s fur.

“Knock, knock,” Annie said softly.

“Is someone there?” the man asked.

He turned his face toward Jack and Annie. Now his eyes were open, but he did not seem to see them. Jack realized that the man was blind.

“Hi, I’m Annie,” said Annie.

“And I’m Jack,” said Jack.

The blind man smiled.

“Good,” he said, nodding. “Would you like to visit with me?”

“Sure,” said Annie.

She and Jack sat down next to the man.

“Do you live in this forest?” Annie asked.

“Yes,” he said.

“Are you a hermit?” Jack asked.

“Yes,” the blind man said.

“What’s a hermit?” said Annie.

“Hermits live far away from other people,” said the blind man. “We like to be alone to think. I live in the forest so I can learn from nature.”

“How do you learn?” asked Jack.

“I listen,” said the blind man.

“Listen to what?” asked Jack.

“To the chatter of the monkeys, the rumble of the elephant, the roar of the tiger,” said the man. “I have listened for so long, they have all begun to sound like one voice—the one great voice of the forest.”

“Did the voice tell you that a tiger got caught in a trap last night?” asked Annie.

“Yes,” the hermit said.

“And did it tell you that after we saved him, he tried to attack us?” said Jack.

The blind man smiled.

“Please bring me one of the white flowers floating on the stream,” he said.

Jack wondered why the hermit was changing the subject.

But Annie jumped up and hurried to the stream. She pulled at one of the large flowers. It came up, muddy root and all. She took it to the blind man.



“Thank you,” he said.

The man touched the flower’s large white petals and its dirty root.

“This perfect lotus blossom grows from dark, thick mud,” he said. “Its beauty cannot live without its ugliness. Do you understand?”

“Yes,” said Jack and Annie.

“When you saved the tiger, you saved all of him,” said the blind man. “You saved his graceful beauty—and his fierce, savage nature. You cannot have one without the other.”

“Oh … right,” said Jack.

“Take this lotus as a thank-you gift from all the forest for saving our fierce friend,” said the blind man. “Our world would not be complete without him.”

Annie took the gift from the hermit.

“A gift from a forest far away,” she said.

Arf! Arf! Teddy wagged his tail.

The langurs clapped.



“We can go home now,” said Jack, “if we can just find the way.”

“Do not worry,” said the blind man. “Your house in the trees is close by. The elephants walked in a large circle. So you are back at the place where you started.”

“Really?” said Jack.

The blind man pointed to the sky.

There was the magic tree house, high in a nearby tree.

“Oh, great,” breathed Jack.

“I told you not to worry,” said Annie. She and Jack pulled on their socks and shoes and stood up.

Before they left, Annie touched the hand of the blind man.

“Thanks for everything,” she said.

The man held her hand for a moment. Then he took Jack’s hand. Jack felt a wave of calm wash over him.

“Thank you,” he said to the blind man.

Kah and Ko chattered and held out their long arms. Jack and Annie hugged the two langurs.



“We’ll miss you,” said Annie.

“You were great tour guides,” said Jack. “Good-bye.”

Then he and Annie took off for the magic tree house with Teddy scampering after them.

At the rope ladder, Jack put Teddy into his pack and climbed up.

Annie carried the lotus blossom as she followed them.

Inside the tree house, Jack picked up the Pennsylvania book. But before he made a wish, he looked out the window with Annie.

In the distance, they saw Saba and the other elephants bathing in the stream.

They saw Kah and Ko swinging on vines.

They saw the tiger sunbathing in the grass, licking his sore leg.

They saw tiny deer grazing.

They saw bright birds in the trees.

They saw the blind man sitting in front of his cave. He was smiling.

Jack opened the book. He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go home,” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind started to blow.

It blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. Who Are You, Really?

Jack opened his eyes.

Late afternoon sunlight shined into the tree house.

“Our third gift,” said Annie.

She put the lotus blossom beside the pocket watch from the Titanic and the eagle’s feather from the Lakota Indians.

“One more gift,” she said to Teddy, “and you’ll be free from your spell.”

The little dog licked her hand.

“Hey, tell me this,” said Jack. “How did you know Teddy wanted us to hide behind that rock?”

Annie shrugged.

“I just knew,” she said. “I think I saw it in his eyes.”

“You did?” Jack looked into Teddy’s eyes.

The little dog tilted his head and stared back at Jack.

Teddy’s eyes twinkled, as if they held many secrets.

“Who are you, really?” whispered Jack.

Teddy just smiled a doggy smile and wagged his tail.

“Come for us again soon,” Annie said. “Okay?”

Teddy sneezed, as if to say, Of course!

Jack grabbed his pack. Then he and Annie climbed down the rope ladder.

When they stood on the ground, they looked up. A little black nose was poking out the tree house window.

“Bye!” they called.

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie took off between the trees.

Birds sang in the twilight. Squirrels scampered playfully through the leaves.

The Frog Creek woods were very tame after the forest in India.

Soon they came to their street. As they walked to their house, the last bit of daylight was slipping away.

Before they went inside, Jack and Annie sat on their steps.

“I have two questions,” said Jack. “If the hermit couldn’t see, how did he know about the tree house? And how did he know that we had traveled all night with the elephants?”

“Easy,” said Annie. “The one great voice of the forest told him.”

“Hmm,” said Jack.

He closed his eyes for a moment and listened.

He heard a car going down the street.

He heard a woodpecker pecking.

He heard crickets chirping.

He heard a screen door opening.

He heard a mom saying, “Time for dinner, kids.”

All the sounds were like one great voice—the one great voice of home.

The Sacred Langur

Hinduism is the main religion of the people of India. It is a religion with many gods and goddesses. One of its important gods is Hanuman, who saved a Hindu goddess named Sita.

Hanuman has the body of a man and the face and tail of a langur monkey. Followers of Hinduism believe that Hanuman’s spirit is alive in the langurs of India. Hindu temples dedicated to Hanuman treat all langurs as special guests.





Endangered Species

In the nineteenth century, there were more than 40,000 tigers in India. Today there are fewer than 4,000. For this reason, the tiger is considered to be a critically endangered species.

The Indian rhino is also a highly endangered species.

The Wildlife Protection Society of India has been formed to help save India’s endangered animals. The society arrests illegal hunters and seizes wildlife products, such as tiger skins and bones, rhino horn, and elephant ivory. It also helps to alert other people around the world to India’s wildlife crisis.

Annie sat on the porch steps. She stared down the street at the Frog Creek woods.

“Hey, Jack,” she said. “Do you hear it?”

Jack sat next to her. He was reading a book.

“Hear what?” he said.

“Teddy’s calling us,” said Annie.

“You’re kidding,” said Jack. But he looked down the street and listened, too.

A faint bark came from the distance.

Arf! Arf!

A big smile crossed Jack’s face.

“You hear it!” Annie said.

“Yep,” said Jack. “You’re right. Time to go.”

He stood up and grabbed his backpack.

“Be back soon!” Annie shouted through the screen door.

“Don’t be late for dinner!” their dad called.

“We won’t!” said Jack.

He and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Soon they came to the tallest oak.

There was the magic tree house. A little black nose stuck out the window.

“Hi, silly!” Annie called. “We’re coming!”

Arf! came a happy bark.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack followed her up into the tree house.

A small dog sat in a circle of afternoon sunshine. His tail wagged.

“Hey, Teddy!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie hugged Teddy. And the dog licked both of them.

“Morgan’s note is still here,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. He knew the note by heart now.


This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

Morgan



Beside the note were the gifts from their first three trips:

1. a pocket watch from the Titanic

2. an eagle’s feather from the prairie skies

3. a lotus flower from a forest in India

“We just need to get a gift from a kangaroo,” said Annie, “and Teddy will be free from his spell.”

“We must be going to Australia,” said Jack. “That’s where kangaroos live.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Teddy whined and scratched at a book lying in the corner.

Jack picked it up.

“What’d I tell you?” he said.

He showed the cover to Annie. The title was Adventure in Australia.

“Great,” said Annie. She looked at Teddy. “Ready to meet a kangaroo?”

Arf! Arf!

Jack opened the book. He found a page with small pictures of different animals and a big picture of a forest. Jack pointed at the forest.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books … I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year … WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home … I have since introduced this great series to my class.

My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





Dear Readers,

I get many letters telling me how much kids learn from reading Magic Tree House books. But what you might not realize is how much I learn writing them. I’m not really an expert on any of the subjects I write about. So I have to do lots and lots of research.

Working on Dingoes at Dinnertime, I was surprised to discover how little I really knew about the continent of Australia. For example, I never knew why it was home to certain animals that lived nowhere else on earth, animals like kangaroos, koalas, wallabies, wombats, platypuses, emus, and black swans.

But after I did my research, I found out the answer. And when you read this book, you’ll discover the answer along with Jack and Annie.

I hope that reading Dingoes at Dinnertime will be just the beginning of your Australian adventure. I hope that when you finish, you’ll go out and do some research of your own and discover lots more about that wondrous land.

All my best,

For Ellen Mager, a great champion of children’s literature





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free an enchanted dog from a spell. They have already received a gift on a trip to the Titanic, a gift from the Lakota Indians, and a gift from a forest in India. Now they are about to set out in search of their last gift …



1. The Last Gift

Annie sat on the porch steps. She stared down the street at the Frog Creek woods.

“Hey, Jack,” she said. “Do you hear it?”

Jack sat next to her. He was reading a book.

“Hear what?” he said.

“Teddy’s calling us,” said Annie.

“You’re kidding,” said Jack. But he looked down the street and listened, too.

A faint bark came from the distance.

Arf! Arf!

A big smile crossed Jack’s face.

“You hear it!” Annie said.

“Yep,” said Jack. “You’re right. Time to go.”

He stood up and grabbed his backpack.

“Be back soon!” Annie shouted through the screen door.

“Don’t be late for dinner!” their dad called.

“We won’t!” said Jack.

He and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Soon they came to the tallest oak.

There was the magic tree house. A little black nose stuck out the window.

“Hi, silly!” Annie called. “We’re coming!”

Arf! came a happy bark.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack followed her up into the tree house.

A small dog sat in a circle of afternoon sunshine. His tail wagged.

“Hey, Teddy!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie hugged Teddy. And the dog licked both of them.

“Morgan’s note is still here,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. He knew the note by heart now.


This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

Morgan



Beside the note were the gifts from their first three trips:

1. a pocket watch from the Titanic

2. an eagle’s feather from the prairie skies

3. a lotus flower from a forest in India

“We just need to get a gift from a kangaroo,” said Annie, “and Teddy will be free from his spell.”

“We must be going to Australia,” said Jack. “That’s where kangaroos live.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Teddy whined and scratched at a book lying in the corner.

Jack picked it up.

“What’d I tell you?” he said.

He showed the cover to Annie. The title was Adventure in Australia.

“Great,” said Annie. She looked at Teddy. “Ready to meet a kangaroo?”

Arf! Arf!

Jack opened the book. He found a page with small pictures of different animals and a big picture of a forest. Jack pointed at the forest.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Sleepyhead

Jack opened his eyes. Glaring hot sunlight flooded into the tree house.

“Neat hats,” said Annie.

She and Jack were both wearing hats.

“I think they will protect us from the sun,” said Jack.

He and Annie looked out the window. Teddy looked out, too.

The tree house had landed in a scrubby forest filled with droopy plants and dry brown trees.

“Man, this place needs rain,” said Jack.

He sat back on his heels and looked at the picture of where they had landed in the Australia book.

He read:

Australia’s forests go through times of drought (say DROWT). A drought is a long period of time without any rain. The same forest can be flooded by heavy rains at other times of the year.



Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:





“Hey, Jack,” said Annie. “Doesn’t it smell like a cookout?”

Jack sniffed the air. It did smell like a cookout.

Jack looked out the window. A wisp of smoke floated above some trees in the distance.



“Maybe people are camping over there,” Jack said.

“Let’s go see,” said Annie.

Jack put his notebook and the Australia book into his backpack.

“Put Teddy in there, too,” said Annie.

Jack slipped the little dog into the pack. Then he followed Annie down the ladder.

When they stepped onto the ground, the hot wind nearly blew their hats off.

“The campers must be over there,” said Annie.

She pointed at the smoke in the blue sky. They started walking across a sun-baked clearing.

They passed bushes and scrawny trees. Lizards ran over the dry, cracked ground.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack’s pack.

“Whoa!” said Jack.

A pair of huge, funny-looking birds walked out from behind a bush.

They were taller than Jack. They had fat bodies, long, skinny legs, and long, skinny necks.

“Who are you? ” Annie asked the strange pair.

Jack opened his pack and took out the Australia book. He found a picture of the birds.

“They’re emus,” he said. He read aloud:

The emu (say EE-myoo) is a large bird that doesn’t fly. It can run as fast as thirty miles per hour.



“Wow, that’s fast,” said Annie.

Arf! Teddy jumped out of Jack’s backpack and barked at the strange birds.

The emus gave the little dog a haughty look. Then they turned and walked proudly away.

Jack wrote in his notebook:



“Look, a live teddy bear!” said Annie.

Jack looked up.

Annie ran to a tree at the edge of the clearing. The “live teddy bear” was nestled in the fork of the tree.

“Aww, it’s so cute!” whispered Annie.

The creature was fast asleep. He had large round ears, a black nose, and a furry body. His feet had long, curved claws.

“It’s a koala bear,” said Jack.

“Hi, sleepyhead,” Annie said to the koala.

She patted his soft fur. He opened his big eyes and looked calmly at her.

Jack found a koala picture in the Australia book. He read:

The koala is actually not a bear at all. It’s a marsupial (say mar-SOUP-ee-ul), like a kangaroo. A marsupial mother carries her babies in a stomach pouch.



“That’s neat,” said Annie.

Jack kept reading:

Koalas mostly eat the leaves of gum trees, so cutting down gum trees to clear land has hurt them. Wildfires are also a threat. Koalas are slow-moving and can’t escape the smoke and flames.



Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:





“What’s wrong, sleepyhead?” Annie asked the koala. “Don’t you feel well?”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “Listen to this—”

He read more from the book:

Koalas, like kangaroos, are active at night and sleep during the day, when the sun is hot. The name “koala” means “no drink,” because koalas rarely drink water. They get moisture from the leaves they eat.



Jack licked his lips. His mouth felt dry.

“Speaking of water,” he said, “I’m thirsty.”

“Me, too,” said Annie.

Teddy was panting, as if he was thirsty, also.

“Let’s find those campers,” said Jack, sighing. “Maybe they can give us some water.”

Jack put Teddy back into his pack. He tucked the book under his arm, in case he needed to look something up.

They began walking again. Suddenly, there was a loud, harsh cackle.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

“What was that? ” said Jack.



3. Big Foot

The loud cry rang again through the dry air.

Teddy barked.

Jack and Annie turned around in the clearing. It was hard to tell where the sound was coming from.

The terrible cackle came again.

“There!” said Annie.

She pointed at a bird in a gum tree. The bird had brown feathers and a large head with a long beak.



It stared down at Jack and Annie. Then it let out another cackle.

“Weird,” said Jack.

He found the bird in his book and read:

The kookaburra (say KOOK-uh-burr-uh) is the best-known bird of Australia. There is even a popular song about it. The kookaburra is also called the “laughing donkey.” This is because the strange sound it makes reminds people of a braying donkey.



“I know that song!” said Annie. She began singing:

“Kookaburra sits on the old gum tree-ee.

Merry, merry king of the bush is he-ee … ”

Jack wrote in his notebook:





Annie stopped singing. “Hey,” she said. “There’s another weird thing.”

“Where?” said Jack.

Annie pointed to a big bluish tan lump lying in a shallow, dusty hole.

“Is it alive?” said Jack.

They stepped closer to the big lump.

“It looks like it’s breathing,” said Annie.

The lump was an animal lying on its back. Its paws were crossed over its chest.

It had huge feet, large ears, a face like a deer’s, and a very long tail. It also had a very fat stomach.



Just then, a small head peered out of its stomach.

“Whoa!” said Jack.

“Oh, wow! It’s a kangaroo with her baby in her pouch!” said Annie.

“Great!” said Jack. “Remember, we have to get a gift from a kangaroo!”

Their voices woke the kangaroo. The animal jumped up from her shallow bed.

She glared at Jack and Annie. Her baby peeked out of her pouch.

The mother kangaroo gave an angry stamp.

“Oh, we’re sorry!” Annie said. “We didn’t mean to wake you up.”

The kangaroo eyed Annie curiously. Then she took a giant hop toward her.

Copying the kangaroo, Annie hopped toward the big animal.

The kangaroo hopped again.

Annie hopped.

The kangaroo and Annie began hopping around each other. They looked as if they were dancing.

Jack couldn’t believe how graceful the kangaroo was. She seemed to fly through the air, then land as softly as a butterfly.

He looked up “kangaroo” in his book and read:

The kangaroo is the most famous of the marsupials. The female carries her baby, known as a “joey,” in her pouch. Scientists call the kangaroo a “macropod,” which means “big foot.” And big feet help a kangaroo hop higher than any other animal in the world. With a running leap, a large kangaroo can jump over a school bus.



“Forget the hopping contest, Annie,” Jack called. “She can out-hop you by a mile.”

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:



The kangaroo began stamping her feet again.

“What’s wrong?” said Annie.

The kangaroo froze.

Grrrr! Teddy growled from Jack’s backpack.

Some nearby bushes moved.

A moment later, three dogs crept silently into the clearing. They were sand-colored and mean-looking.

Teddy growled once more.



But the dogs crept toward the kangaroo.

Suddenly, the mother kangaroo sprang into the air, away from the dogs.

The dogs chased after her.

“Stop!” cried Annie. “Stop! Leave her alone!”

As the kangaroo jumped, she turned in midair and landed facing a different direction. She then zigzagged over rocks and bushes.

Howling, the wild dogs raced after the kangaroo and her baby.



4. Joey

“Oh, no!” cried Annie. “We have to save her!”

She took off after the dogs.

Arf! Arf! Arf! Teddy barked over Jack’s shoulder.

Jack ran after Annie with the book under his arm. He ran over the dry, cracked ground, past scrubby bushes and scattered gum trees.

Jack kept his eye on Annie, running ahead of him. He saw her stop suddenly. She turned and dropped to her knees.

“What happened?” he shouted.

“Come look!” she said.

Jack reached Annie. Beside her in the grass was the baby kangaroo. It was trembling.

“Don’t be scared,” Annie was saying. Then she looked at Jack. “Where’s his mom? Why did she drop him?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

He put his pack on the ground and opened the Australia book. Teddy jumped out of the pack.

The little dog tried to sniff the baby kangaroo.

“Don’t scare him, Teddy,” Annie said.

Teddy sat back and watched politely.



Jack opened the Australia book and found a picture of a baby kangaroo. He read:

The biggest enemy of the kangaroo is the dingo, the wild dog of Australia. When a mother kangaroo is chased by dingoes, she may throw her joey out of her pouch. Without the extra weight in her pouch, she can leap faster and farther. She then leads the dingoes away from her baby. If she escapes the dingoes, she returns to the joey.



“Oh, Jack,” Annie said sadly. “I hope his mother escapes from the dingoes.”

“Me, too,” said Jack.

“Hi, Joey,” said Annie. She gently patted the baby kangaroo. “He’s so soft, Jack.”

Jack knelt down and touched the brown fur. It was soft, the softest fur he had ever felt.

The shy little kangaroo stared at Jack with big brown eyes and trembled.

“Don’t be scared, Joey,” Annie said. “Your mom’s going to come back for you.”

Joey jumped away from Jack and Annie. He hopped toward Jack’s pack, which was sitting on the ground.

The baby kangaroo took a giant leap and dived headfirst into the pack! His whole body went inside, but his big feet stuck out. Then he turned himself over and peeked out at Jack and Annie.

They both laughed.

“He thinks your pack is a pouch!” said Annie. “I know. Put it on backward. It will feel like when his mom carries him.”

Jack put his Australia book on the ground. Then Annie helped him put the pack on his chest instead of on his back. The joey was heavy!



“There,” Annie said. “You look just like a mother kangaroo.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But he patted the baby’s soft fur.

“Don’t worry,” he said to Joey. “You can stay in there till your mom gets back.”

“Here, Joey, would you like some grass to eat?” asked Annie.

Annie scooped up a handful of grass and gave it to the kangaroo.

He munched the grass, keeping his big eyes on Annie.

“I hope his mom comes back for him soon,” she said worriedly.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

He looked around the dry forest. There was no sign of the mother kangaroo.

But Jack saw something else.

“Look,” he said to Annie.

The wisp of smoke in the sky had turned into a big black cloud. Jack noticed the smell of burning wood was much stronger.

“What are those campers doing?” said Annie. “Are they making a bonfire now or what?”

A feeling of dread came over Jack.

“What if … ” he said. “What if … ”

In the distance, a tree suddenly burst into flames.

“We’re looking at a wildfire! ” he said.



5. Wildfire!

“Wildfire?” said Annie.

“The woods are so dry, everything’s starting to burn!” said Jack. “We have to get out of here.”

“We can’t leave Joey,” said Annie.

“We’ll take him with us!” said Jack.

“But what if his mom comes back for him and he’s not here?” said Annie.

“We don’t have a choice,” said Jack.

Just then, the kookaburra flew through the sky, cackling.

The emus raced by at top speed.

The air was getting smokier and smokier. The fire was spreading quickly!

“Come on!” said Jack. “We have to get back to the tree house before it burns down!”

“Which way’s the tree house?” said Annie.

“I’m not sure,” said Jack.

Smoke hid the treetops. Jack’s eyes stung.



“Forget it,” he said. “Let’s just get away from this smoke. Come on!”

Jack and Teddy turned to go. The baby kangaroo hid his head inside Jack’s pack.

“I’ll catch up!” said Annie. “I have to get something!”

“What? ” cried Jack.

But Annie had dashed off in the other direction.

“Come back!” Jack shouted. “Annie!”

Branches cracked and fell from the trees. Smoke billowed everywhere.

Arf! Arf!

“Annie!” Jack cried.

Jack choked on the smoke. He coughed and rubbed his eyes. The air was getting hotter.

He had no choice. He had to run.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from somewhere ahead.

“Hurry, Annie!” Jack called helplessly. Then he took off after Teddy.

He stumbled blindly through the brush. All he could do was follow the sound of Teddy’s barking. His pack felt heavier and heavier. He held it up with his arms and kept going.

Suddenly, Jack heard Annie calling him.

Jack stopped.

“Here! Here! Here! We’re here!” he shouted. “Come on! Follow us!”

Annie appeared through the haze of the hot smoke. She was coughing. Tears streamed from her eyes.

She was carrying the koala!

“Come on!” Jack cried. “Follow Teddy!”

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie carried Joey and the koala. They followed Teddy’s barking through the smoky, fire-filled forest.

Finally, they came to a giant rock.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy was standing on a ledge. Behind him was the mouth of a cave.

Through the smoke, Jack could barely see the little dog.

Teddy barked again, then vanished inside the cave.

“Follow him!” said Annie.



6. Hand to Hand

Jack and Annie climbed onto the rock ledge and stepped into the cave. The air inside was cleaner and cooler than the air outside.

“I can’t see anything,” said Jack.

He patted the head of the baby kangaroo.

“Me neither,” said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

“I guess we’ll have to follow Teddy’s bark,” said Annie. “Let’s hold hands.”

She held out her free hand to Jack. Jack took it. Then he put his other hand out and touched the wall. The joey moved in his pack.

Jack and Annie walked into the darkness.

Arf!

Teddy kept barking, leading them on.

Arf!

Arf!

Arf!

Arf!

Suddenly, Jack felt something thump against his leg. He stopped and gasped.

“What is it?” said Annie.

Arf!

It was Teddy! His tail was wagging and hitting Jack’s leg.

“What is it, boy?” Jack asked him.

Teddy let out a howl.

As he howled, an amazing thing happened.

A white line began to glow in the air. The glowing line grew until it looked like a giant snake. Then glowing handprints appeared below the snake.



Jack felt Annie squeeze his hand.

“I think it’s painted on the wall,” she said.

“But what is it?” whispered Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie.

She let go of Jack and put her hand inside one of the painted handprints.

Jack did the same.

Despite the glowing painting, the rock felt smooth and cool. It almost seemed to breathe.

A ghost-like whistling sound came through the darkness. Then a loud boom!

“What’s that? ” Jack quickly took his hand off the wall.

The boom came again.

“It sounded like thunder,” said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

“Teddy’s leaving!” said Annie.

She grabbed Jack’s hand. They turned back the way they had come and followed Teddy’s barking again.

Arf!

They followed the little dog until they saw a flash of light.

“Lightning,” said Annie. “Lightning and thunder! We’re at the front of the cave! Yay!”

Annie pulled Jack toward the mouth of the cave and out, into a pouring rain.



7. Rain, Rain, Rain

Rain fell on Jack’s head and on Joey’s head. Rain fell on Annie’s head and on Teddy’s head and on the koala’s head.

Annie opened her mouth and drank the rainwater.

Jack did the same. The water tasted better than any water he’d ever drunk.

When Jack looked back at the woods, misty steam was rising from the charred ground and burning bushes.

The heavy rain was putting out the wildfire.

“You’ll be safe now,” Annie said to the koala. “I’ll put you back in a nice gum tree. Then you can finish your nap.”

“I see a tree that’s not burned,” said Jack.

They walked over to the unburned gum tree. Annie placed the koala in the fork of two branches.

“Go back to sleep now,” she said softly. “Pretend the fire was all a dream.”

“Good night,” said Jack.

The koala seemed to smile at them. Then he closed his eyes and went to sleep, as if he’d never been disturbed at all.

Jack sighed and looked around.

“Man,” he said, “we were lucky that a storm came.”

Annie smiled.

“It wasn’t just luck,” she said. “It was magic.”

“Magic?” said Jack.

“Yeah … the glowing hands and the snake,” said Annie. “Somehow they brought the storm.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” said Jack.

Joey stirred in his pack. Suddenly, Jack remembered something.

“Hey, we have to get Joey back to the place where his mom left him,” he said. “Or she won’t be able to find him.”

“Where was that place?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

He looked around at the rainy gray forest. Everything looked the same.

“Teddy can find the spot!” said Annie.

Without even a bark, the little dog took off across the wet, muddy ground.

Once again, Jack and Annie followed him. Jack’s back was beginning to hurt from carrying Joey.

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie caught up with Teddy. He stood over the Australia book! It was wet, but not burned.

“Hurray, we found it!” said Annie.

“That’s right!” said Jack. “I left our book in the spot where we found Joey!”

“Once again, Teddy helped us out,” said Annie.

She patted the little dog’s head.

“Thanks, Teddy,” Jack said.

He picked up the Australia book. The cover was wet, but the pages looked okay. The little kangaroo peeked out of his pack as Jack tucked the book under his arm.

“Don’t worry, Joey,” Annie said. “We’ll stay right here till your mom comes back for you.”

If she hasn’t already come … Jack thought worriedly.

Jack and Annie stood in the rain with Teddy and Joey and waited.

They waited and waited.

The rain turned to a drizzle. Then the drizzle turned to a light sprinkle.

Still, they waited …

Jack grew sadder and sadder.

Maybe the mother kangaroo had come and left. Or maybe she had been caught by the dingoes. Or maybe she had been killed by the wildfire.

Jack was afraid to look at Annie, afraid to say anything.

“I know what you’re thinking,” she said finally.

Jack patted Joey’s head and sighed.

“Let’s wait a little longer,” he said. “If she doesn’t come back soon, we’ll take him home with—”

Arf! Teddy barked softly.

“Listen,” said Annie.

Jack listened.

The sound was very faint at first. But then it grew louder.

It was a squishy sound. It was a squashy sound. It was the sound of big feet slapping through mud!



8. The Rainbow Serpent

The mother kangaroo bounded out of the trees.

She landed ten feet away from Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Joey.

They all were still for a moment, as if they all were holding their breath.

Then Joey tried to jump out of Jack’s backpack.

“Hold on,” said Jack.

He put his pack on the ground.

The little kangaroo leaped out.

He leaped again … then again … and dived headfirst into his mother’s pouch!

Joey turned himself over inside the pouch. Then he peeked out at Jack and Annie.

“Yay!” said Jack and Annie together. They laughed and clapped with relief.

“He looks happy to be home,” said Annie.

“His mother looks happy, too,” said Jack.

The mother kangaroo was gazing down at her joey. She patted his head with her small paws.

Then she looked at Jack and Annie with soft eyes.

“She’s saying thank you to us,” Annie said.

“You’re welcome,” Jack said.

“It was no problem,” Annie told the kangaroo. “You have a great joey.”

The kangaroo gave a little nod. Then she bent over and used a front paw to pick up a small piece of bark from the wet grass.

The kangaroo held the piece of bark out to Jack and Annie.



Jack took it from her.

“Oh, man,” he whispered. “It’s our gift from a kangaroo.”

The kangaroo then sprang into the air. She bounded gracefully away through the charred forest.

“Thanks!” called Jack.

“Bye!” called Annie. “Good luck!”

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

The rain stopped as Jack studied the piece of bark. There was a tiny painting on it. It was just like the snake painting in the cave.

“I wonder what the snake means,” said Jack.

Jack opened the wet cover of the Australia book. He carefully turned the damp pages. He found a picture of the snake painting.

“Listen,” said Jack. He read:

The first people of Australia are called “Aborigines” (say ab-uh-RIJ-uh-neez). They have lived there for 40,000 years. Their myths take place in a time they call “Dreamtime.” In Dreamtime, there is a Rainbow Serpent, who sends life-giving rain.



Aborigine artists paint the Rainbow Serpent on cave walls or on pieces of bark. In special ceremonies, they sometimes honor the Rainbow Serpent by painting their handprints on the magic snake.



“See?” said Annie. “That explains everything!”

“Explains what?” said Jack.

“We put our hands on the painting of the Rainbow Serpent,” she said. “It was like a special ceremony. So the Rainbow Serpent sent the rain to put out the wildfire.”

Arf! Teddy barked.

Jack frowned.

“But it’s not a real creature,” he said. “It’s in Dream time. Not real time.”

Annie smiled.

“Then how do you explain that? ” she said. She pointed at the sky.

The rain clouds were gone. The sun had come back out.

A rainbow curved across the blue Australian sky.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. Though the air was warm again, he shivered.

“Teddy led us to the painting,” said Annie. “We should thank him.”

“How did he know about the Rainbow Serpent in the cave?” Jack asked.

“I told you,” said Annie. “He has a touch of magic.”

They looked down at the little dog. Teddy tilted his head and seemed to smile.

“Hey, we have all four gifts now!” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah!” said Jack.

“Let’s go home and see if Teddy’s spell is broken!” said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

Jack put the bark painting and the Australia book in his pack. Then they all headed through the wet, steamy forest in the direction of the tree house.

“I hope the tree house didn’t get burned!” he said.

They went past the clearing, past the gum trees and bushes.

The tree house was waiting for them.

“It’s still here! ” said Annie.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

Jack put Teddy in his pack and followed.

Inside the tree house, Teddy wiggled out of the pack. He pawed the Pennsylvania book.

Arf! Arf!

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there!”

“Over the rainbow!” said Annie.

And the wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



9. What Boy?

“Welcome back,” came a soft, lovely voice.

Jack opened his eyes.

It was Morgan! They hadn’t seen Morgan in a long time.

“Morgan!” cried Annie.

She threw her arms around the enchantress. Jack jumped up and hugged Morgan, too.

“It’s good to see you both,” said Morgan.

Arf! Arf!



“And it’s good to see you, too,” Morgan said, smiling at the little dog.

“Look,” said Annie. She reached into Jack’s pack and pulled out the piece of painted bark. “A gift from a kangaroo.”

“We have all four gifts now,” said Jack.

“Good work,” said Morgan.

She picked up their first gift. It was the pocket watch from the Titanic.

“Once upon a time, there was a boy who wasted time,” Morgan said. “This watch teaches him that time is very precious. It must be used wisely.”

Morgan picked up their second gift, the eagle’s feather from the Lakota Indians.

“Sometimes the boy was afraid to stand up for himself,” she said. “The eagle’s feather teaches him that a small creature can be one of the bravest.”

Morgan picked up the lotus flower from the forest in India.

“Sometimes the boy did not respect nature,” she said. “This flower teaches him that nature holds many wonders.”

Morgan picked up the piece of bark with the painting of the Rainbow Serpent.

“Sometimes the boy didn’t want to study other times and places,” she said. “This painting teaches him there is mystery, magic, and wisdom in the traditions of ancient peoples.”

“What boy?” Jack asked.

“Who are you talking about?” asked Annie.

Morgan didn’t answer right away. She placed her hands on Jack’s and Annie’s shoulders.

“Thank you,” she said, “for helping this boy learn his lessons. Thank you for breaking the spell.”

“What boy?” Jack asked again.

Arf! Arf! Arrrrrrrf!

Jack and Annie looked over at Teddy.

Then something magical happened.

In a flutter of time …

in the spin of a whirlwind …

Teddy was changed.

He was no longer a dog.

He was a boy.



10. Dreamtime

The boy was on the ground on his hands and knees.

“Meet my young helper from Camelot,” said Morgan.

The boy glanced up. He had a friendly freckled face and twinkly dark eyes. His hair was the same color that Teddy’s fur had been. He looked a bit older than Jack, about ten or so.

“Am I back?” he asked.

“You’re back,” said Morgan.

The boy leaped up and hugged her.

“Thank you!” he cried.

“And I hope next time you’ll ask before trying the spells in my spell book,” said Morgan.

The boy grinned sheepishly.

“I promise.” Then he looked at Jack and Annie. “I accidentally changed myself into a dog,” he said.

Annie laughed.

“But at least I got to have exciting adventures as a dog!” he said.

“You were a great dog,” said Annie. “We liked you as Teddy. What’s your real name?”

“If you like, you can keep calling me Teddy,” the boy said. “Or how about Ted?”

“Okay, Ted,” said Annie.

Jack just nodded. He was still in shock.

“Ted is training to work in my library at Camelot,” said Morgan. “He has a rare gift for magic.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

“You—you helped us a lot, Ted,” said Jack, finally finding his voice.

“Oh, no, it was both of you who helped me,” said Ted. “You helped break the spell. And I found new stories to take home.”

“You did?” said Annie.

Ted nodded.

“The story of the Titanic, the story of White Buffalo Woman, the story of the wounded tiger, and the story of the Rainbow Serpent,” he said. “I’ll write them down as soon as I get home. So people can read them in Morgan’s library.”

“And home is where we must go now, I’m afraid,” said Morgan.

“Oh,” said Annie sadly. “That’s too bad.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He was sad, too.

“I know we will meet again someday,” said Ted.

“I hope so,” said Jack.

“Me, too,” said Annie. “Bye!”

She started down the ladder.

Jack pulled on his pack. With a heavy heart, he followed.

When they got to the ground, they looked up.

Morgan and Ted were at the window. They both seemed to glow in the late afternoon light.

“The magic tree house will return for you soon,” said Morgan. “I promise.”

She waved, and they waved back.

“Good-bye, Jack and Annie,” she said.

“Arf!” said Ted.

In a flutter of time …

in the spin of a whirlwind …

the magic tree house was gone.

For a long moment, Jack and Annie stared at the empty tree.

“Ready for dinner?” Annie asked softly.

Jack nodded.

He felt dazed as they walked silently through the Frog Creek woods.

When they came to their street, the sun was setting. A flock of black birds flew through the silvery pink sky.

Annie broke their silence as they headed for their house.

“We had great adventures with Teddy—I mean Ted—didn’t we?” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “It was like … ” He searched for the right words. “Like … ”

“Like living in Dreamtime,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He smiled.

That was exactly what it was like.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK


1) Australia is the world’s smallest and flattest continent. The country of Australia is the only nation in the world to occupy a whole continent. The continent is almost 3 million square miles, or the size of the United States without Alaska and Hawaii.


2) At one time, all the continents on earth were part of one huge land mass. Australia became separated from this mass about 200 million years ago. Because it is a separate continent, its animals have evolved differently from those on other continents.


3) Among the animals that live on Australia are 170 different kinds of marsupials, including koalas, wombats, kangaroos, and wallabies (which are like kangaroos, only smaller). The only marsupials that live outside Australia are opossums.


4) Kangaroos have been in Australia for 25 million years. For every person in Australia, there are ten kangaroos—and there are almost 19 million people in Australia! A kangaroo hops at about 11 mph but can put on bursts of speed of up to 30 mph.


5) Dingoes were used as hunting dogs by the Aborigines.


6) Koalas feed on gum trees, which are also known as eucalyptus (say yoo-cuh-LIP-tus) trees. People use the oil of the eucalyptus tree in medicines for colds and flu. Eucalyptus also has a strong smell that many people enjoy.





The Rainbow Serpent

In Aborigine myth, the Rainbow Serpent not only brings rain but also helped create the world.

At the beginning of time, the Rainbow Serpent awoke from sleep and pushed through the earth’s crust. As it traveled over the empty land, it left behind deep tracks.

The Rainbow Serpent called to the frogs to come out from beneath the earth. It tickled the frogs’ bellies, and when they laughed, water poured from their mouths. The water filled the Rainbow Serpent’s tracks, making rivers and lakes.

Grass grew. Then all creatures—birds, lizards, snakes, kangaroos, koalas, and dingoes—woke up and took their places on the earth.

Jack looked out his window.

It was a dreary Sunday afternoon. There were dark clouds in the sky.

Thunder rumbled in the distance.

Jack stared down the street at the Frog Creek woods.

When is the magic tree house coming back? he wondered.

“Hey, guess what!” Annie said. She charged into Jack’s room. “I saw a light flash in the woods!”

“It was just lightning,” said Jack.

“No, it was magic! A swirl of light!” said Annie. “I think the tree house just came back!”

“I’m sure it was just lightning,” Jack said. “Didn’t you hear the thunder?”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “But let’s go check anyway.”

She started out of Jack’s room. Then she peeked back in.

“Bring your backpack, just in case!” she said.

Jack was always glad for a chance to look for the magic tree house. He grabbed his backpack and followed Annie down the stairs.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Out to play,” said Annie.

“Don’t go far,” said their mom. “And come in if it starts to rain.”

“We will,” said Jack. “Don’t worry.”

They slipped out the front door. Then they ran up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

The woods were dark under the storm clouds. A cool wind shook the leaves.

Soon Jack and Annie came to the tallest oak tree.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “You were right!”

The magic tree house stood out against the gray sky.

“Morgan!” called Annie.

There was no sign of the enchantress.

“Let’s go up!” said Jack.

He grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie followed.

They climbed into the tree house. It was hard to see in the dim light.

“Look,” said Annie.

She pointed to a piece of paper and a book lying on the floor.

Jack picked up the paper. Annie picked up the book.

“Listen,” said Jack. He held the paper close to the window and read aloud:


Dear Jack and Annie,


Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:





Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn Something to lend

Thank you,

Morgan





“Camelot is in trouble?” said Jack. “What’s that mean?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But we better hurry and find these writings. Let’s go look for the first: Something to follow.”

“I wonder where we should look for it,” said Jack. “What’s the title of the book you’re holding?”

Annie held the book close to the window to read the title.

“Yikes,” she said softly. She showed the book to Jack.

On the cover was a painting of a peaceful- looking field and a blue sky. The title said The Civil War.

“The Civil War?” said Jack. “Cool.”

Annie frowned.

“Cool?” she said. “War’s not cool.”

“It sort of is,” Jack said uncomfortably. He knew war was bad. But some parts of it seemed fun, like a game.

“I guess we’ll find out,” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “I wish we could go there.”

Thunder boomed through the woods.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

As I’ve said before, my Magic Tree House books are often inspired by ideas that readers send to me. Well, the idea for this book came from Megan Barber, a reader who entered a Magic Tree House writing contest. I am very grateful to Megan for her thoughtful and creative suggestion.

One reason I love writing this series is that the readers I meet and hear from are always so helpful and supportive. If you could see the world from my point of view, you would see it was filled with wonderful kids, kids just like Jack and Annie who love learning new things and going on daring adventures.

So now get ready for your next daring reading adventure … a journey to the time of the Civil War in America.





All my best,

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian of Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie freed a mysterious little dog from a magic spell.

In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie have a new challenge. They must find four special kinds of writing for Morgan’s library to help save Camelot. They are about to set off to find the first of these …



1. A Light in the Woods

Jack looked out his window.

It was a dreary Sunday afternoon. There were dark clouds in the sky.

Thunder rumbled in the distance.

Jack stared down the street at the Frog Creek woods.

When is the magic tree house coming back? he wondered.

“Hey, guess what!” Annie said. She charged into Jack’s room. “I saw a light flash in the woods!”

“It was just lightning,” said Jack.

“No, it was magic! A swirl of light!” said Annie. “I think the tree house just came back!”

“I’m sure it was just lightning,” Jack said. “Didn’t you hear the thunder?”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “But let’s go check anyway.”

She started out of Jack’s room. Then she peeked back in.

“Bring your backpack, just in case!” she said.

Jack was always glad for a chance to look for the magic tree house. He grabbed his backpack and followed Annie down the stairs.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Out to play,” said Annie.

“Don’t go far,” said their mom. “And come in if it starts to rain.”

“We will,” said Jack. “Don’t worry.”

They slipped out the front door. Then they ran up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

The woods were dark under the storm clouds. A cool wind shook the leaves.

Soon Jack and Annie came to the tallest oak tree.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “You were right!”

The magic tree house stood out against the gray sky.

“Morgan!” called Annie.

There was no sign of the enchantress.

“Let’s go up!” said Jack.

He grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie followed.

They climbed into the tree house. It was hard to see in the dim light.

“Look,” said Annie.

She pointed to a piece of paper and a book lying on the floor.

Jack picked up the paper. Annie picked up the book.

“Listen,” said Jack. He held the paper close to the window and read aloud:


Dear Jack and Annie,


Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:





Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend





Thank you,

Morgan





“Camelot is in trouble?” said Jack. “What’s that mean?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But we better hurry and find these writings. Let’s go look for the first: Something to follow.”

“I wonder where we should look for it,” said Jack. “What’s the title of the book you’re holding?”

Annie held the book close to the window to read the title.

“Yikes,” she said softly. She showed the book to Jack.

On the cover was a painting of a peaceful-looking field and a blue sky. The title said The Civil War.

“The Civil War?” said Jack. “Cool.”

Annie frowned.

“Cool?” she said. “War’s not cool.”

“It sort of is,” Jack said uncomfortably. He knew war was bad. But some parts of it seemed fun, like a game.

“I guess we’ll find out,” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “I wish we could go there.”

Thunder boomed through the woods.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. Cruel War

Glaring sunlight filled the tree house.

“It’s really hot here,” said Jack.

“Especially in these clothes,” said Annie.

Their clothes had magically been changed. Annie wore a long dress. Jack wore scratchy pants and a long-sleeved shirt. His backpack was now a leather knapsack.

“Where are we?” asked Annie.

They looked out the window together.

The tree house had landed in a tree at the edge of a field—the same field on the cover of the book.

“It looks so peaceful,” said Jack. “Where’s the Civil War?”

“There,” whispered Annie with a shiver. She pointed to the woods beyond the field.

Jack saw a soldier riding a horse out of the woods. The horse was covered with mud. The soldier’s blue uniform was torn. His arm was bloody.

Another man rode into the field. His blue uniform was in rags, too. His head was ban-daged.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “Who are they?”

He opened the Civil War book and found a painting of some soldiers in blue. He read to Annie:

1861–1865

The Civil War is also called the “War Between the States,” because it was fought between the Southern and Northern states of the United States. Southerners wore gray uniforms and were called Confederate soldiers. Northerners wore blue uniforms and were called Union soldiers.



“So they’re Union soldiers,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:





Jack looked at his book again. He read aloud:

The Civil War was a cruel and bloody war. More people died in this war than in all of America’s other wars put together. One out of every five young men in the nation died or was wounded.



“That’s so sad,” said Annie.

Jack wrote in his notebook:





“Wow, they keep coming,” Annie said.

Jack looked up. More Union soldiers were coming through the field. These didn’t have horses.

They all looked sad and weary. Some of them limped. Some of them helped others along. One man stumbled and fell down.

“I have to help—” said Annie.

“Wait!” said Jack.

She started down the rope ladder.

“You can’t help!” said Jack. “A kid can’t help … ”

But Annie kept going.

“Don’t forget—we have to find some special writing for Morgan!” Jack called in a loud whisper. “Something to follow!”

He packed the Civil War book and his notebook in his knapsack. Then he started down the ladder.

When he stepped onto the ground, Jack saw Annie in the distance.



She was holding her hand out to the fallen soldier. She helped him to his feet.

The soldier slowly started walking again. Annie walked beside him.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. And he hurried to catch up with Annie.

The sun was scorching hot as Jack ran through the dry field. He was sweaty in his scratchy clothes.

He caught up with Annie. Together, they walked silently with the soldiers.

At the edge of the field was a steep hill. Everyone stopped and gazed at the sight below them—rows and rows of white tents.

“Thank goodness,” said the soldier beside Jack. “We’re saved.”



3. Field Hospital



Jack and Annie walked with the soldiers into the camp.

Outside one tent was a long line of men in torn blue uniforms. They looked tired and hurt. Many were bloody and barely able to stand.

Women wearing dark dresses were giving out food and water to the men in line.

“Where are we?” asked Annie.

“I’ll find out,” said Jack.

He pulled out their book and found a picture of the campsite. He read:

During the Civil War, field hospitals were set up quickly near battlefields to treat wounded soldiers. Soldiers stayed in the field hospitals for a short time before going back to fight, or moving to a larger hospital, or being sent home. This field hospital in Virginia took care of over 400 patients.



“That’s a lot,” said Annie.

“It sure is,” said Jack.

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:





Jack read aloud again from the book:

More than 3,000 women helped out as nurses during the Civil War. Nursing was a new job for women in America. Before the war, only men had been nurses.



“Wow,” said Annie. “Maybe we can be nurses.”

“Forget it,” said Jack. “Kids can’t be nurses.”

Jack wanted to find the special writing for Morgan and go home. The sad scene at the field hospital was making him feel sick.

“I’ll just ask,” said Annie.

She headed over to a nurse cooking over a campfire.

“Annie! We’ve got a mission!” Jack called.

But Annie kept going.

Jack heaved a sigh. He tucked his notebook and the Civil War book under his arm and followed her.

Waves of heat rose from a small cooking fire. The young nurse was heating a pot of coffee.

Flies buzzed everywhere.

“Hello,” said Annie.

The nurse barely smiled at them.

Her face was red and beaded with sweat. Her eyes looked terribly tired.

“Where are you from?” she asked.

“Frog Creek,” said Annie. “We’d like to volunteer as nurses.”

The young woman didn’t seem at all surprised.

“We could certainly use some help,” she said, sighing. “Some of us have not slept for days.”

“Why not?” asked Jack.

“The wounded are coming here from a battle near Richmond,” said the nurse. “More and more keep coming. It never seems to end.”



“Just tell us what to do,” said Annie.

“While we feed the new patients, you can go to the first two tents,” the young nurse said, “and give the other soldiers their noon meal.”

She pointed to a basket filled with bread and potatoes. Next to it was a ladle and a bucket filled with water.

“Anything else?” Annie asked.

“Just try to give them comfort,” the nurse said.

“How do we do that?” said Annie.

“I don’t have time to show you,” the nurse said. “But here’s a list of things that can help.”

She pulled a piece of paper from her apron pocket and handed it to Annie.

Annie read the list to Jack:

Be Cheerful.

Lessen sorrow and give hope.

Be brave.

Put aside your own feelings.

Don’t give up.



“Follow that list,” said the nurse, “and you can’t go wrong.”

The nurse took the pot of coffee from the fire and carried it to the line of men.

“Follow … ” said Jack. “Follow that list … ”

“That’s what she said,” said Annie.

Jack took the list from her.

“Don’t you get it?” he said. “This is it! We found it! The special writing for Morgan’s library! Something to follow.”

“Yes!” said Annie.

Jack put the paper into his knapsack.

“It was handed right to us!” he said, smiling. “We can go home now!”

“Oh, no! Not now!” said Annie. “We have to help as nurses first.”

“But, Annie—” said Jack.

She picked up the food basket. Then she started toward the row of white tents.

“Wait—we’re supposed to leave,” Jack said weakly. “Our mission is over.”

The truth was that he didn’t want to help. He didn’t want to be around wounded and suffering soldiers. It was too sad.

“Bring the water bucket and the ladle!” Annie shouted. Then she disappeared inside the first tent.

Jack groaned. He knew he couldn’t change her mind.

He pulled out the list and read the first line: Be Cheerful.

“Oh, brother,” he said.

Jack put the list back into his knapsack. He picked up the heavy bucket. Hurrying clumsily after Annie, he tried to smile.

4. Freedom Fighters


Jack carried the water bucket into the tent.

The scene inside was like a nightmare.

The tent was hot and stuffy. A dozen injured soldiers lay on small cots. Some called for food. Others begged for water or just moaned.

Jack wanted to rush back outside. But Annie got right to work. She rolled up her sleeves and smiled.

“Hi, everybody!” she said cheerfully.

None of the soldiers smiled back.

“I have good news!” she said. “We’ve brought lunch!”

Annie moved down the row of cots. She handed out pieces of bread and chunks of potatoes to all the patients.

“You’ll be feeling better soon,” she said to one sick man. “You’ll see your family again,” she told another.

Jack looked around nervously. He wasn’t sure what to do.

“Give them water, Jack!” Annie called to him.

Jack saw a tin cup beside each man’s cot. He picked up the first cup. Carefully, he used the ladle to fill it with water.

Keeping his eyes down, Jack handed the cup to the patient. He felt shy and uncomfortable. He didn’t know what to say.

Jack moved on to the next patient, then the next. He gave each wounded man a cup of water. But he never looked right at any of them or spoke a word.

Soon Jack and Annie had finished passing out food and water.

“Good-bye!” Annie said.

She waved and left the tent. Jack quickly followed her.

“Let’s go home now,” he begged once they were outside. “We’ve got what we came for.”

“If we leave now, the patients in the next tent will go hungry and thirsty,” said Annie.

Jack sighed.

“Okay,” he said. “But after we take care of them, we’re leaving for sure.”

He followed Annie into the next tent.

Just like the last tent, it was filled with wounded soldiers. But the soldiers in this tent were all African-Americans.

“Hi, everybody!” Annie said, smiling warmly.

Again, she passed out potatoes and bread. She also talked and made jokes.

Jack poured water into each of the tin cups. Again, he didn’t speak to any of the soldiers. But as he handed over the last cup, a patient spoke to him.

“Thank you for your kindness, son,” the soldier said.

Jack glanced shyly at the man on the cot. He was an elderly, silver-haired black man.

“You’re welcome,” said Jack.

He tried to think of something else to say. He remembered Annie’s cheerful words.

“You’ll get well soon,” he told the patient. “You’ll be with your family again.”

The man shook his head.

“No. I’ll never be with my family again,” he said quietly. “My wife and children were sold long ago.”

“Sold?” said Jack.



“Yes. We were slaves,” the man said.

“You were a slave?” asked Jack.

“All of us in this tent were once slaves,” the man said. “We ran away from our owners in the South to fight to end slavery, to fight for freedom for our people. I ran barefoot for over thirty miles to tell the Union soldiers that the Confederates were going to attack.”

The man fell silent.

“You’re a very brave freedom fighter,” said Jack.

“Thank you, son.” The man closed his eyes.

Jack wanted to know more about slavery. But he didn’t want to bother the weary patient. He pulled out the Civil War book.

He found a picture of African-Americans standing on a platform. The men, women, and children had chains on their hands and feet.

Jack read:

In the 1800s, the United States was divided over the issue of slavery. The North wanted the country to end all slavery. But the South wanted to keep slaves because more than four million African-American slaves worked in the huge plantation fields there. This disagreement between the North and South led to the Civil War.



Jack looked down at the man’s face. He looked very weary.

Jack pulled the nurse’s list of rules from his knapsack.

Lessen sorrow and give hope, he read.

Jack put the list away. He leaned close to the man and spoke in a soft voice: “One day your great-great-grandchildren will be doctors and lawyers,” he said.

The man opened his eyes.

Jack went on. “They’ll help run the government and schools. They’ll be senators and generals and teachers and principals.”

The man stared hard into Jack’s eyes.

“Can you see the future, son?” he asked.

Jack nodded. “In a way … ” he said.

The man smiled a beautiful smile.

“Thank you, son,” he said. Then he closed his eyes again.

“Good luck,” whispered Jack. He hoped the brave man would live to enjoy freedom.

“Ready to go home now, Jack?” said Annie. She had finished passing out the food.

Jack nodded.

As he and Annie stepped out of the tent, they heard someone shout, “She’s back!”

A horse-drawn wagon was barreling into the camp.

“Who’s back?” asked Annie.

“Clara Barton,” a patient said. “She runs this hospital.”

“Clara Barton!” said Annie. “I don’t believe it!”

“Who’s Clara Barton?” asked Jack. He’d heard the name before. But he couldn’t remember who she was.

“Who’s Clara Barton?” said Annie. “Are you nuts?”

She ran to meet the wagon.

5. Angel of the Battlefield



Jack still didn’t remember who Clara Barton was. He pulled out the Civil War book and read:

Clara Barton was a famous Civil War nurse. When she began nursing, she used her own money for her supplies. She drove a horse-drawn “ambulance” right onto the battlefield to help save wounded soldiers. For this reason she became known as the “Angel of the Battlefield.”



Jack put the book away. Then he hurried to Annie.

He looked at the woman sitting in the driver’s seat of the wagon.

She doesn’t look like an angel, Jack thought.

The woman was very small. She had a plain, serious face and dark hair pulled back in a bun. She wore a long black skirt and a black jacket.

In the back of her wagon were more wounded soldiers in torn, bloody uniforms. They moaned and cried out.

Nurses, both men and women, were putting the wounded men on stretchers.

Clara Barton wiped her forehead. She looked hot and tired.

“Can we help you, Miss Barton?” Annie asked.

“Who are you?” said Clara Barton.

“Jack and Annie,” said Annie. “We’re volunteer nurses. What can we do, Miss Barton?”

Clara Barton smiled.

“First, you can call me Clara,” she said. “Second, would you ride with me back toward the battlefield? There are more wounded waiting to be picked up.”

“Sure!” said Annie.



Jack didn’t answer. After seeing all the suffering men in the wagon, he was afraid of getting closer to the battlefield.

“And you?” Clara asked Jack. Her dark, serious eyes looked right into his.

Jack didn’t want to admit he was afraid. “Sure, no problem,” he said.

“Very good,” said Clara Barton. “Let’s go.”

Jack and Annie climbed up into the driver’s seat next to her.

By now, all the soldiers had been taken out of the wagon.

“Take care of my new family members,” Clara called to the nurses.

She snapped the reins. The horse-drawn ambulance rolled off, sending up clouds of dust.

6. Keep Low!


The wagon jerked and swayed as it bumped over the dry ground.

Jack felt as though he were frying in the hot sunlight. Dust from the road filled his throat and eyes.

The boom of cannons grew louder and louder. Jack heard popping sounds, too, like the noise of firecrackers.

“What’s that popping noise?” he shouted, blinded by the dust and sunlight.

“Musket fire!” said Clara.

Jack remembered that muskets were long, old-fashioned guns.

“What are those flashes?” asked Annie.

Jack tried to open his eyes and see what she was talking about.

He saw bright flashes of light in the distance and puffs of smoke in the sky.



“Cannon shells exploding,” said Clara Barton. “Shells are like small bombs. They have ruined much farmland.”

Jack squinted at the passing countryside. The ground was filled with ugly holes. Long ditches were also cut through the fields.

“Did the shells make those ditches, too?” he asked.

“No. Those are trenches the soldiers dug for a battle,” Clara said. “Each side digs their own. Day after day, they sit in the trenches, firing their muskets at one another.”

Jack tried to imagine how terrible it would be to sit in a trench all day, waiting to be shot—or waiting to shoot someone else.

“We have to get some water,” said Clara.

She drove the wagon to a narrow creek. A stream of water flowed downhill, running over rocks.

The wagon came to a halt. Jack heard a whistling sound, then another.

“Keep low!” cried Clara.

“What’s that?” Jack asked.

“Cannon fire!” she said.

Jack and Annie crouched down in the driver’s seat.

Jack felt a rush of panic. He pulled out their list. His hands were shaking as he read:

Be brave.

Oh, great, he thought.

Another cannon shell whizzed overhead, then another.

The ground exploded over and over in flashes of light. Dirt clods flew everywhere. Clouds of smoke and more dust filled the air.

The horses neighed and whinnied.

Be brave! Jack thought. Be brave!

7. Helping Hands

The firing came to an end. The horses calmed down. The smoky air began to clear.

Clara handed Jack and Annie each a canteen.

“Fill these quickly,” she said. “We have no time to waste.”

Jack’s legs felt wobbly as he followed Annie to the creek. They filled their canteens, then climbed back into the wagon.

“Keep alert,” said Clara. “Look for the wounded as they come off the battlefield.”

She snapped the reins. The horses started off again.

As they bumped along, Jack looked ahead for wounded soldiers.

“There!” said Annie.

She pointed to a man limping toward them and waving his arms.

The man looked very young, more like a teenage boy. His uniform was torn and bloody. It wasn’t a blue uniform, though. It was gray.

Clara pulled the horses to a stop.

“But he’s a Confederate soldier,” said Jack.

“When someone is hurt, you give them a helping hand, no matter who they are,” said Clara. Her voice got softer. “I have seen courage and kindness on both sides of this war. Sometimes things are not as simple as they seem.”

Jack was glad they had stopped to help the soldier.

He jumped out of the wagon.

“Do you need a helping hand?” he asked the young man.

“Thank you,” the soldier said softly.

Jack helped him into the back of the wagon. The soldier lay down on a pile of blankets and closed his eyes.

Jack climbed back onto the seat beside Clara. She snapped the reins, and they rode on.

They came across more ragged men resting in the shade of an oak tree. These soldiers all wore blue uniforms.

Again, Clara stopped the horses.

“See if any of those men need a ride to the hospital,” she said to Jack and Annie.

Jack glanced at the soldier sleeping in the back of the wagon.

“Can a Confederate and a Union soldier be together?” he asked worriedly.

Clara nodded.

“Sometimes men are simply too sick and tired to be enemies anymore,” she said. “Sometimes they even know each other. Many families and friendships have been torn apart by this war.”

“Let’s go,” said Annie, hopping out of the wagon. Jack followed her.

They carried their canteens to the men under the oak tree.

“Hi!” said Annie. “Does anyone need to go to the hospital?”

“Only John, our drummer boy,” a soldier said. “He’s suffering from heat stroke. But we all need some water, miss.”

Jack saw a young boy lying on the ground. His eyes were closed.

“Oh, Jack!” whispered Annie. “He looks just like you.”

The boy did look a lot like Jack—just a few years older.

“We better get him to Clara’s ambulance right away,” Annie said.

She handed her canteen to one of the tired soldiers. Another soldier lifted the drummer boy to his feet.

The boy opened his eyes and mumbled a few words. He tried to walk, but he swayed as if he were about to faint.



“Wait—” Jack grabbed the boy. “We’ll give you a helping hand,” he said.

The drummer boy put his arms around Jack’s and Annie’s shoulders.

“Just a little further, John,” Annie said. “You’re doing great. Just a little further … ”

The drummer boy moved as if he were walking in his sleep. His head hung down. His feet shuffled in the dust.

“Take good care of him!” one of the men called. “We can’t do without him!”

8. Brothers


Clara Barton had turned the wagon around. She helped Jack and Annie lift the drummer boy into the back.

“The soldiers said he has heat stroke,” Annie told Clara. “His name is John.”

The boy lay down next to the sleeping Confederate soldier.

“He does have heat stroke,” Clara said. “The other boy also has a high fever. We must get them to the hospital at once. Can you two stay in the back of the wagon and do as I tell you?”

“Sure,” said Jack and Annie.

Clara dampened two clean cloths with water from Jack’s canteen.

“Gently press these cloths against their faces to help cool them off,” she said.

She gave the cloths to Jack and Annie.

Then she went to the front of the wagon and climbed in. The wagon started forward.

Jack and Annie gently patted the soldiers’ faces with the damp cloths. Jack looked at the young men lying side by side. The two seemed far more alike than different.

In another time and place, they might have been friends, Jack thought.

Finally, the wagon arrived at the field hospital. The Confederate soldier was put on a stretcher and carried to a tent.

Two soldiers wearing bandages put the drummer boy on a stretcher.

“Could you stay with John awhile?” Clara Barton asked Jack and Annie.

“Sure,” said Jack.

“Try to bring down his fever,” Clara said. “A nurse will give you ice packs to press against his skin. Find me when his fever is lower.”

The drummer boy was carried into an empty tent. Jack and Annie followed.

John was put on a cot. Then a nurse brought some rags and a bucket filled with ice. Jack and Annie were left alone with the boy.

Jack wrapped some ice in a rag. He pressed the ice pack against the boy’s head and neck and arms. Annie fanned the air to cool John off and to keep away the flies.

Jack felt so hot he pressed an ice pack against his own face for a moment. Then he looked up drummer boys in his Civil War book. He read:

The Civil War was the last war to use drummer boys. The drumbeat was used to give orders to soldiers. Different beats told them when to eat, how to march, and even how to fight. On smoky battlefields, the boy’s drumming helped soldiers find one another and keep together.



“Wow,” said Jack. He closed the book, pulled out his notebook, and wrote:





Suddenly, John shouted. Jack looked up from his notebook. The drummer boy was still asleep, but he was waving his arms as if he were having a nightmare.

Annie shook the boy’s arm.

“Wake up, John,” she said. “You’re okay. Wake up.”

The drummer boy opened his eyes.

“You were having a bad dream,” said Annie. “You’re safe now. You’ll see your family again soon.”

“No! No!” the boy said. He sounded frantic. “I have to go back to the battlefield.”

“No, you don’t have to fight anymore,” said Annie. “You can go home and be safe.”

“No!” the boy said. “They need me! They need my drum!” He sounded more and more upset.

Jack thought about their list.

Put aside your own feelings, he remembered.

“Okay, John,” said Jack. “You can go back as soon as you feel better.”

“Jack!” said Annie. “He’ll get hurt or killed! I’m afraid for him!”

“Me too,” Jack said softly. “But we have to put our own feelings aside. That’s one of the things on our list.”

Annie sighed.

“Okay,” she said sadly. She looked at John. “If you want to fight again in the Civil War, you can. If that’s what you really want.”

“Thank you,” the boy whispered.

“You know, you’re the bravest kid I’ve ever met,” Jack said.



The drummer boy smiled at Jack.

“You look just like my little brother,” he said hoarsely.

“You look just like my big brother,” said Jack, “except I don’t have a big brother. I don’t have any brothers.”

The three of them laughed. The drummer boy’s laugh was very soft.

The boy laid his head back on his pillow and closed his eyes again.

In a moment, he was sleeping peacefully. A smile was on his lips.

Annie felt his forehead.

“His fever’s gone down,” she said. “We should go tell Clara.”

Annie left the tent.

Jack got up and slowly followed her.

When he reached the entrance of the tent, he turned and looked back. The shadows of twilight fell across the boy’s calm, sleeping face.

It was strange. Jack hardly knew the drummer boy. But he felt they could be brothers.

Listening to the cannon fire in the distance, Jack was afraid for the boy.

Will he live to see his family again? Jack wondered.

“Good luck, John,” Jack said softly.

With a heavy heart, Jack stepped out into the warm evening air.

9. Don’t Give Up

“Annie?” said Jack.

“Over here!” she called.

Jack saw two figures standing in the twilight.

He walked over to Annie and Clara. They all stared in the direction of the distant battlefield.

Bright lights flashed against the dark blue horizon—cannon shells exploding.

“Every time you see a flash, you know a shell may have taken a life or many lives,” said Clara.

“That’s awful,” said Annie.

“Yes, it is,” said Clara. “A whole world can vanish in that flash—all a young man’s joys and sorrows, all his memories.”

“This is a cruel war!” said Annie.

“All wars are cruel,” said Clara Barton. “People feel they must fight for causes they believe in. But they soon discover that war is not about glory and fame. It’s about misery and terrible pain and sadness.”

“It makes me miss my mom and dad,” said Annie. “It makes me really miss them.”

Annie sounded tired and homesick. Finally, she had lost her cheerfulness.

“I think it’s time for you two to go home,” said Clara.

Jack thought of all the wounded men who needed food and water and kindness and comfort.

“No!” Jack said. “We have to stay. We can’t give up. That’s on the list—Don’t give up.”

Jack pulled out their list to show Clara Barton.

“Oh, yes,” she said, nodding. “I see one of my nurses has written down the things I often say. Let me add one thing more—Do not forget the ones who love you.”

Jack heaved a big sigh. He was homesick, too.

“Can we keep the list?” he asked.

“Of course,” said Clara. “You don’t have to work in a hospital to follow my words. They work in all of life no matter where you go.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.



“My thanks to both of you,” said Clara Barton. “You were great helpers.”

“You were a great teacher,” said Annie.

“Good-bye,” said Clara Barton. “Be very careful going home.”

“We will,” said Jack and Annie. “Bye.”

The sun was setting as they walked out of the camp. The boom of cannons sounded in the distance.

Soldiers sang a song around a campfire.





We’re tenting tonight

on the old camp ground;

Give us a song to cheer

Our weary hearts,

a song of home,

And friends we love so dear.





Jack and Annie walked through the darkening field. By the time they reached the woods, the stars were out.

They climbed up the rope ladder to the tree house. Annie grabbed the Pennsylvania book.

“Wait,” said Jack.

He looked out the window. He couldn’t see anything below. But the soldiers’ song still carried through the warm, starry night.





Many are the hearts

that are weary tonight,

Wishing for the war to cease …





As Jack listened, he thought of Clara Barton, the elderly slave, the young Confederate soldier, and John, the drummer boy …

“War is not a game,” Jack said softly. “It is definitely not a game.”





Many are the hearts

looking for the right

To see the dawn of peace.





The song ended. The cannon fire stopped. The night was quiet, except for the croaking of frogs.

“Ready?” Annie whispered.

“Ready,” said Jack.

“I really wish we could go home,” Annie said, pointing to the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. Home, Sweet Home

There was a booming in the distance.

Jack opened his eyes and caught his breath. Is that cannon fire? he wondered. Are we still back in the Civil War?

“We’re home,” said Annie. “Home, sweet home.”

“Oh, man,” Jack whispered.

They were home. They were back in the Frog Creek woods. They were wearing their own comfortable clothes again.

The cannon fire was really only thunder. At that moment, Jack loved the thunder.

Raindrops tapped against the tree house.

“We better hurry,” said Jack.

“Wait. Leave the list in the tree house,” said Annie. “It’s the first special writing for Morgan’s library. Something to follow.”

Jack took the list of Clara Barton’s rules out of his pack. He put it on the floor next to Morgan’s letter.

“I wonder how that list will help save Camelot?” he said.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But you know what’s weird about getting that list? I think we couldn’t just have taken it home when we first got it. We had to live it first.”

Jack nodded. Annie was completely right, he thought. He picked up his backpack.

“Wait! I see another note!” said Annie.

She picked a piece of paper off the tree house floor. On it was written: Come back on Wednesday.

“I guess that’s when Morgan wants us to look for the next special writing,” said Annie.

“That’s in three days,” said Jack. “Let’s go home and rest.”

He started down the rope ladder. Annie followed.

When they stepped onto the ground, the rain began to pour down.

“Run!” said Jack.

They ran through the Frog Creek woods, then down their street. They ran to their porch and dashed into their dry, cozy house.

They found their parents reading in the living room.

“Dad! Mom!” Annie cried. “We’re so glad to see you!”

“Well, we’re—we’re glad to see you, too,” their dad said, sounding a little puzzled.

“Go put on dry clothes,” said their mom.

Jack and Annie started up to their rooms. Halfway up the stairs, Jack stopped.

“Oh, I have a question,” he called to his parents. “Did anyone in our family fight in the Civil War?”

Their dad looked surprised. “Yes,” he said. “One of your great-great-great-grandfathers was a drummer boy.”

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

“What was his name, Dad?” asked Annie.

“John,” their dad said.

Jack and Annie gasped.

“And—and what happened to John?” Jack asked. “Was he hurt in the war?”

“No, he grew up to be a schoolteacher,” their mom said. “He had five children.”

Jack and Annie whooped with joy.

“That’s great news!” said Annie.

“Really great news!” said Jack. “Thanks for telling us!”

“Sure.” Their dad smiled, though he looked puzzled again.

As Jack hurried up to his room, some words from the Civil War song ran through his mind:





Give us a song to cheer

Our weary hearts, a song of home …

“Tenting Tonight on the Old Camp Ground”





We’re tenting tonight on the old camp ground;

Give us a song to cheer

Our weary hearts, a song of home,

And friends we love so dear.





(Chorus)

Many are the hearts that are weary tonight,

Wishing for the war to cease;

Many are the hearts looking for the right

To see the dawn of peace.

Tenting tonight, tenting tonight,

Tenting on the old camp ground.

We’ve been tenting tonight on the old camp ground,

Thinking of days gone by,

Of the loved ones at home that gave us the hand

And the tear that said, “Good-bye!”





(Chorus)

CLARA BARTON

Clara Barton, known as the “Angel of the Battlefield,” nursed soldiers during the Civil War. She also used her own money to bring them supplies. After the war, she formed a bureau to search for soldiers who were missing as a result of the war. Her work brought information to more than 22,000 families.

In 1881, Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross. Her organization not only provides relief during times of war but also helps people who have suffered terrible natural disasters, such as hurricanes or floods.





DRUMMER BOYS

It is thought that nearly 60,000 boys served as drummer boys or buglers in the Civil War. One of the youngest drummer boys was Johnny Clem, who enlisted at the age of eleven. He was so brave that he was made a sergeant when he was only thirteen!

“Wake up, Jack!” Annie whispered.

Jack opened his eyes. He looked at his clock. It was six A.M.

“Come on!” Annie whispered. She was standing at his bedroom door, already dressed.

“Now?” said Jack.

“Yeah, it’s Wednesday! We have to go to the tree house!” she said.

“Oh, man, Wednesday!” said Jack. Suddenly, he was wide awake.



“We have to help save Camelot,” said Annie.

“I know, I know,” said Jack, scrambling out of bed.

“Meet you out front,” said Annie.

Jack quickly changed into his jeans and T-shirt. He threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack.

Then he slipped down the stairs and out the front door.

Annie was waiting in the gray early light.

“All set?” she whispered.

“Yep,” said Jack.

They took off running across their yard. They ran down their quiet street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Soon they came to the tree house. They climbed up the rope ladder.

In the early light, they saw Morgan’s note, the same note they’d found on Sunday. Jack picked it up and read aloud:



Dear Jack and Annie,



Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:



Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend



Thank you,

Morgan



Annie picked up a piece of paper lying on the floor. It was a list of rules from the famous nurse Clara Barton. They had met her on their journey to the Civil War.

“On Sunday we found the first special writing,” said Annie, “something to follow.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and now we need to find the second thing, something to send.”

He picked up a book lying near the note. The cover showed soldiers on a snowy riverbank.

The title was The Revolutionary War.

Jack frowned.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie.

“Another war,” said Jack, sighing.

“You still want to go?” said Annie.

“We have to,” said Jack. He hated the suffering he’d seen in the Civil War. But they had no choice. They had to help Morgan and save Camelot.

He pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there,” Jack said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

Some time ago, I wrote a biography of George Washington. While doing my research for that book, I began to greatly admire him. Ever since, I’ve wanted to “visit” him again. Happily, Revolutionary War on Wednesday finally gave me the chance to do just that.

Sal Murdocca, the wonderful artist for the Magic Tree House series, and I thought it would be fun to model our cover after one of America’s most famous paintings: Washington Crossing the Delaware, painted by Emanuel Leutze in Germany in 1851. This huge painting now hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

We’d like to point out several errors in Leutze’s painting (and our cover!), however. First, a general would never have stood up on a rough ride like that. Second, the boat in the painting is much smaller than the ones Washington actually used. And third, the first American flag with thirteen stars, representing the thirteen colonies, was not actually designed until some time after Washington crossed the Delaware.

Still, we love the painting and thought it would be fun to put Jack and Annie into it for our cover.

Have a good time on your journey with Jack, Annie, and George Washington. Just remember—don’t stand up in the boat!

All my best,

For the Foley family—

John, Susie, Jack, and Elliot



One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie freed a mysterious little dog from a magic spell.

In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie have a new challenge. They must find four special kinds of writing for Morgan’s library to help save Camelot. They are about to set off to find the second of these …

1. Wednesday!


“Wake up, Jack!” Annie whispered.

Jack opened his eyes. He looked at his clock. It was six A.M.

“Come on!” Annie whispered. She was standing at his bedroom door, already dressed.

“Now?” said Jack.

“Yeah, it’s Wednesday! We have to go to the tree house!” she said.

“Oh, man, Wednesday!” said Jack. Suddenly, he was wide awake.



“We have to help save Camelot,” said Annie.

“I know, I know,” said Jack, scrambling out of bed.

“Meet you out front,” said Annie.

Jack quickly changed into his jeans and T-shirt. He threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack.

Then he slipped down the stairs and out the front door.

Annie was waiting in the gray early light.

“All set?” she whispered.

“Yep,” said Jack.

They took off running across their yard. They ran down their quiet street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Soon they came to the tree house. They climbed up the rope ladder.

In the early light, they saw Morgan’s note, the same note they’d found on Sunday. Jack picked it up and read aloud:



Dear Jack and Annie,



Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:



Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend



Thank you,

Morgan



Annie picked up a piece of paper lying on the floor. It was a list of rules from the famous nurse Clara Barton. They had met her on their journey to the Civil War.

“On Sunday we found the first special writing,” said Annie, “something to follow.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and now we need to find the second thing, something to send.”

He picked up a book lying near the note. The cover showed soldiers on a snowy riverbank.

The title was The Revolutionary War.

Jack frowned.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie.

“Another war,” said Jack, sighing.

“You still want to go?” said Annie.

“We have to,” said Jack. He hated the suffering he’d seen in the Civil War. But they had no choice. They had to help Morgan and save Camelot.

He pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there,” Jack said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

OceanofPDF.com



2. Day or Night?

Jack shivered. The wind blew hard.

“It’s cold,” he said. He could see his breath in the air.

“Wrap your scarf tighter,” said Annie.

Jack looked down. He had a wool scarf around his neck.

He was also wearing woolen pants that buttoned at the knees, a coat, and a hat with three corners. On his feet were funny-looking shoes with buckles. In place of his backpack was a leather bag.

Annie was wearing a long coat over a long dress.



Jack pulled his scarf tighter. Then he looked out the window with Annie.

They’d landed in trees near an icy river. The sky was gray and heavy with clouds.

“It’s almost day—or almost night. I can’t tell,” said Annie.

“Yeah. I hope it’s almost day,” said Jack.

“I wonder where we’ll find something to send?” said Annie.

Jack shrugged.

“First we have to find the Revolutionary War,” he said.

He opened their research book. By the gray light, he read:

Over 200 years ago, the United States was made up of thirteen colonies ruled by Britain. From 1775 until 1782, American “patriots” fought for independence from Britain. This was called the Revolutionary War.



Jack took out his notebook. He wrote:





Jack turned the page. There was a picture of soldiers in red uniforms. He read aloud:

During the Revolutionary War, British soldiers wore red uniforms. For this reason, they were called “redcoats.”



Jack wrote in his notebook:





“Wow, snow,” said Annie.

Jack looked up from his writing. Annie was holding her hand out the window. A few snowflakes blew into the tree house.

“Not much yet,” said Jack. “But we better find the special writing soon.”

“Well, stop reading and come on,” said Annie. She buttoned up her coat and started down the ladder.

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He packed the research book and his notebook into his bag. Then he followed Annie.

When they stepped onto the ground, there were more snow flurries. The sky was growing darker.

“I’m afraid it’s almost night instead of day,” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie, looking around. “Hey, look—people.”

She pointed up the river. In the misty distance was a campfire. Several men sat around the fire. They all held muskets.

“Maybe they can help us,” said Annie. She started away. But Jack grabbed her.

“Wait, I think they’re soldiers,” he said. “They have muskets. Remember the muskets from the Civil War? The guns that the soldiers carried?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Annie.

“They might be redcoats,” said Jack. “Let’s sneak closer and get a better look at their uniforms.”

“Quick,” said Annie, “before it’s too dark to see.”

3. It’s Time


Annie lifted up her long dress and ran to a tree close to the river. Jack held on to his hat and ran after her.

They peeked out from behind the tree. More snow flurries swirled in the twilight.

“Redcoats?” whispered Annie.

“Can’t tell,” said Jack.

In the flickering firelight, the men didn’t seem to be wearing uniforms at all. They wore ragged pants and coats. Some even had their feet wrapped in tattered cloth.

“Come on,” Annie said.

She ran to a tree closer to the river.

Jack followed.

“This is as close as we should get,” he whispered.

“But we still can’t tell what they’re wearing,” said Annie.

She crept forward and hid behind a scraggly bush.

“No closer!” Jack whispered.

But Annie took off again. She crouched behind a rock. She was only about ten feet from the campfire.

Oh, brother, she’s way too close now, Jack thought.

But he took a deep breath and ran to the rock.

When he joined Annie, she looked at him and grinned.

“This is like hide-and-seek,” she whispered.

“It’s not a game, Annie,” Jack whispered back. “It’s war. Be serious.”

“I am serious!” said Annie, her voice rising.

“Shh!” said Jack.

But it was too late. One of the men stood up and looked around.



“What’s the matter, Captain?” another asked.

“I heard something,” said the captain. He held up his musket.

Jack stopped breathing.

“Who’s there?” the captain shouted.

Jack looked at Annie. She shrugged.

“We’re caught,” she whispered.

“Who’s there?” the captain shouted again.

“Just two kids,” Annie answered in a small voice.

“Come out and show yourselves!” the captain said.

Jack and Annie stood up from behind the rock. They both held up their hands.

“We come in peace,” said Annie.

In the shadowy twilight, the captain moved toward them.

“Who are you?” he asked.

“We’re Jack and Annie,” said Annie.

“Why were you spying on us?” he asked.

“We weren’t spying,” said Jack. “We just wanted to know if you were redcoats or patriots.”

“Which would you like us to be?” the shadowy figure asked.

“Patriots,” said Jack.

“We are patriots,” the captain said.

“Thank goodness!” said Annie.

The captain smiled.

“Where are you from?” he asked. His voice had softened.

“We’re visiting relatives nearby,” Jack said.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvania,” said Annie at the same time.

“But that’s amazing!” the captain said. “My farm is in Frog Creek. Where is your farm?”

Jack didn’t know how to answer.

“It’s near the Frog Creek woods,” said Annie.

“All farms are near woods,” the man said with a laugh. “What—”

Just then, someone called from up the river. “It’s time, Captain!”

The captain turned to the other men near the campfire. “It’s time!” he repeated.

The soldiers quickly put out their fire. They stood with their muskets on their shoulders.

“Time for what, Captain?” Annie asked.

“Time to meet up with our commander-in-chief,” he said. “Return to your family now so your mother and father won’t worry about you.”

“Yes, sir,” said Jack.

“It is nice to see children,” the captain said. “I was just trying to write a letter to my own son and daughter. I didn’t know what to say.”

“Tell them that you miss them,” said Annie.

The man smiled.

“And I do, indeed,” he said softly.

Then he turned and headed up the riverbank. His ragged men followed behind. Soon they all disappeared into the cold mist.

Jack looked around. The wind was blowing harder. The snow was sticking to the ground.

“What now?” he asked.

More than anything, he wanted to go back home. With the soldiers gone, the riverbank felt lonely and scary.

“We still have to find something to send,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack.

“Maybe we should just follow the captain and his men,” said Annie. “They might lead us to something.”

Jack wasn’t sure that was a good idea. But he didn’t have a better one.

“Okay. But let’s try not to get caught this time,” he said.

He and Annie took off through the frozen twilight, following the snowy footprints of the American patriots.

4. Commander-in-Chief

Jack and Annie ran along the riverbank. The wind whooshed over the cold water. Wet snowflakes hissed in the dark.

But then Jack heard other sounds. He heard voices, lots of voices.

He and Annie soon came upon hundreds and hundreds of soldiers gathered near the dark river.

Many carried oil lanterns. The lanterns gave an eerie glow to the snowy twilight.

“The captain and his men must be here somewhere,” said Jack, looking around.

Boats like giant canoes were tied near the river. Men were leading horses and loading cannons onto the boats.

“What are they all doing?” said Annie.

Jack pulled out their Revolutionary War book. He read in a whisper:

On Wednesday, December 25, 1776—



“December 25? That’s Christmas!” said Annie. “Today’s Christmas!”

“Cool,” said Jack. He started reading again:

On Wednesday, December 25, 1776, the patriots were losing the war. Ragged and weary, many were ready to give up. Then something began to happen that would turn the war around. About 2,400 American patriots gathered on the west bank of the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. They prepared to cross the river to go on a secret mission.



“A secret mission? Oh, man … ,” said Jack.

He started to pull out his notebook.

“Attention, troops! The commander-in-chief!” a soldier shouted.

Jack and Annie saw a man in a dark cape and a three-cornered hat ride up on a white horse.

The commander-in-chief loomed above the crowd of soldiers. His cape flapped in the wind.

He sat calmly and with dignity on the back of his horse.



Even at a distance, Jack thought the commander-in-chief looked familiar, very familiar. But he couldn’t figure out why.

“A dangerous mission lies before you all,” the man shouted above the wind. “But I want you to have courage. You must remember the words of Thomas Paine.”

The commander-in-chief held up a piece of paper. He read to his men:

“ ‘These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country. But he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.… ’ ”

“Wow, that’s great,” whispered Annie.

Listening to the powerful words, Jack felt his spirits rise, too.

“ ‘The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph,’ ” the commander-in-chief read on. “ ‘What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything its value.’ ”

There was a silence, as if everyone were thinking about the words the man had read. Then the soldiers started cheering and clapping. They didn’t seem tired at all anymore. Now they seemed eager to set out on their mission.

The commander-in-chief saluted his men. He steered his horse toward the river.

As the horse moved past them, Jack got a better look at the rider.

He gasped.

Of course! he thought. He’d seen that face before—on dollar bills!

Jack grabbed Annie’s arm.

“I know who the commander-in-chief is!” he exclaimed. “He’s George Washington!”

5. The Letter

“George Washington? Really?” said Annie.

“Yeah, I think he is!” said Jack.

“Wow! Where’d he go?” said Annie. “I want to see him again! Come on!”

She started toward the river.

“Wait—don’t go far,” said Jack. “I just want to make sure it’s him.”

He opened the Revolutionary War book. He found a picture of the boats on the riverbank. He read:

When General George Washington gathered his troops by the Delaware River, he was commander-in-chief of the whole American army. The general led the army for six years, until America became a free and independent nation. In 1789, he was elected the first president of the new United States.



“Oh, man, it is him,” said Jack.

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:





“Hey, what are you writing?” someone asked.

Jack looked up.

A bearded soldier was pointing at him.

Jack shoved the Revolutionary War book and his notebook into his bag.

“Nothing, sir,” he said. He started walking away.

The man shouted after Jack. But Jack ran down toward the river and lost himself in a crowd of soldiers.

When he looked over his shoulder, he was relieved. The bearded man was nowhere in sight.

“Stop, young man!” Someone shone a lantern right in Jack’s face.

Jack gasped.

It was the captain.

“I told you to go home, Jack,” the captain said sternly. “Where’s your sister?”

Jack looked around. Where was Annie?

“I don’t know,” he said.

“Find her at once and go back to your family!” the captain ordered. “Our secret mission is very important. Children will only get in the way.”

“Yes, sir!” said Jack.

The captain started to leave. But he stopped.

“I wonder if you could do me a favor, Jack?” he asked.

“Sure,” said Jack.

The captain pulled out his letter.

“This is my letter to my children,” he said. “It’s a farewell letter. Would you please take it back with you to Frog Creek?”

“Yes, sir,” said Jack.

“You must only send it if you hear that we have failed in our mission and many patriots were lost,” said the captain.

“Yes, sir,” said Jack.

The captain handed his letter to Jack.



“I copied the general’s speech for my children,” the captain said. “If anything bad happens to me, I hope those words will give them courage.”

The captain then turned and disappeared into the crowd.

“Good luck, Captain!” Jack called. He hoped he would never have to send the letter to the man’s children.

Suddenly, Jack clutched the letter to his chest.

“Send!” he whispered.

This letter was the writing they’d been looking for—something to send! He and Annie could go home now! Their mission was over!

Jack shoved the captain’s letter into his bag. Now he just had to find Annie.

As he looked around, he shivered.

“Where is she?” he muttered.

Jack started moving through the crowd, looking for Annie.

It was hard to see. The wind was blowing harder. The snow fell faster.

Jack started to panic.

“Annie!” he called.

As he wove quickly in and out of the crowd, he kept calling for her. None of the soldiers noticed him. They were all too busy.

Finally, Jack came to the river.

Through the lamplit mist, he saw soldiers waiting to get into the boats. Some had already climbed aboard.

“Jack!” came a cry.

Jack saw the figure of a small girl. She was sitting in the back of the biggest boat.

“No way,” he whispered.

Jack charged down to the boat. He stood at the edge of the water.

“What are you doing?” Jack shouted.

“This is George Washington’s boat,” Annie said. “It’s our big chance to spend time with him! We might not get another one.”

Jack looked at the other end of the huge boat. Through the mist and falling snow, he saw the commander-in-chief talking to his crew.

“We can’t go with him,” said Jack. “We’ll get in the way of his secret mission. Besides, we have something to send now!”

“What? How?” said Annie.

“A letter! The captain gave me his letter to take back to Frog Creek!” said Jack. “We’re only supposed to send it if something bad happens to the captain. We can go home now!”

“Oh, can’t we go a little later?” Annie asked.

Jack climbed into the boat to pull her out.

“No, come on,” he said, taking her hand.

Suddenly, the crew moved to the back of the boat, near Jack and Annie. The men grabbed their oars and started pushing the boat away from the shore.

“We’re taking off,” said Annie.

“No! We have to get out!” Jack said to the rowers.

But the men were working too hard to pay attention. They were using their oars to hack up the ice at the edge of the river.

“Excuse me,” Jack said in a loud voice.

Just then, the boat jolted forward. Jack nearly lost his balance.

The boat broke through more ice. Rough waves sloshed against its sides.

“We have to go back!” said Jack.

“Too late,” said Annie.

They were headed across the Delaware River!

6. Crossing the Delaware


The huge boat rocked in the water. Giant chunks of ice smashed against its sides.

“Thanks a lot, Annie,” Jack whispered. He shivered in the snowy cold. “We’re not supposed to go on their secret mission with them.”

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “Maybe we can help George Washington.”

“Are you nuts?” Jack whispered. “We should be on our way home now.”

The boat hit a piece of ice. The boat bounced, then dipped into the river.

Jack clung to the wooden side. He hoped they wouldn’t turn over. Nobody could survive in this icy water, he thought. It would be like sinking on the TITANIC.

The crew fought hard to keep the boat moving forward. They rowed past chunks of ice into a smoother part of the river.

Light from oil lamps shone on the water, making the ice chunks behind them glow like huge, glittering jewels.

Jack looked back. Other boats were following them. They were filled with soldiers, horses, and cannons.

“Where exactly are we going?” Annie whispered.

Jack shrugged. He reached into his bag and pulled out their Revolutionary War book.

By the dim lantern light in the boat, he searched through the book. He found a painting of General Washington crossing the Delaware River.



He showed the painting to Annie. They each read the caption silently:

After George Washington crossed the Delaware, he led his men on a nine-mile march to a British post. The post was filled with Hessians, German soldiers hired by the British to fight for them. The American patriots caught them off guard. The Hessians never thought the patriots would attack on a stormy Christmas night. It was a great victory for the patriots. They captured almost 1,000 Hessians. Hardly any of Washington’s men were lost.



“Yay! We won’t have to send the captain’s letter!” Annie exclaimed.

“Shh!” said Jack.

But George Washington turned around and looked back at Jack and Annie.

Oh, no, Jack thought, caught again.

He closed his eyes, as if that would make him invisible.

“He’s coming,” said Annie.

Jack looked up.

George Washington was making his way back toward them.

In the next moment, the commander-in-chief loomed above them like a giant shadow.

“Children?” he asked in a quiet, angry voice.

“Sorry,” Jack squeaked.

“Merry Christmas!” said Annie.

But George Washington did not say “Merry Christmas” back.

7. Spies!

“What are you doing here?” George Washington asked. The commander-in-chief sounded furious.

“We made a mistake,” Jack said. “We—we didn’t mean to come.”

George Washington turned to the rowers.

“Who let these children sneak aboard?” he asked in a stern voice.

The men looked at Jack and Annie with surprise.

“It’s not their fault,” Annie said quickly. “They were working too hard to notice us.”

Just then, the boat banged against the ice. The ice cracked. The boat moved on, then bumped against the shore.

Two soldiers jumped out and pulled the boat up on the shore.

George Washington looked at Jack and Annie.

“This boat is returning to get more men,” he said. “When it does, you two will get out and stay on the other shore.”

“Yes, sir,” said Jack. He felt very embarrassed.

George Washington then gave orders to the rowers.

“Make sure these children do not board any other boats when you return,” he said.

The general stepped onto the riverbank.

The wind started to pick up. The snow fell harder. As the crew unloaded the boat, neither Jack nor Annie spoke.

Jack was miserable. They had caused trouble for George Washington—just when the general was trying to make America an independent nation.

Jack desperately wished he and Annie had gone home earlier.

They watched more and more boats land on the riverbank. As the soldiers unloaded their weapons and horses, a freezing rain began. Now rain, snow, and sleet fell together.

Jack heard George Washington call to one of his men.

“This storm is getting worse, Major!” the general said.

“Yes, sir!” the major said.

“I think we’re in for a blizzard,” said Washington.

“Yes, sir! Our mission may be hopeless, sir,” said the major. “Should we call it off?”

“No, you shouldn’t,” Jack whispered. “You’re going to win.”

“Should we turn back, sir?” the major said.

“No, no!” said Annie.

She stood up. The boat rocked.

“Don’t turn back, George Washington, sir!” she shouted. “You have to march on, sir! You have to attack the Hessians, sir!”

“Shh!” Jack tried to pull Annie back down. “We’re not supposed to know about their secret mission!”

“How does she know our plans, Major?” George Washington asked.

“Listen to us, sir!” said Annie. “You’re going to win!” She pulled away from Jack and jumped out of the boat.

“Annie!” Jack leaped onto the riverbank. He scrambled after Annie up the steep, icy slope.

“You have to lead your men, General Washington, sir!” Annie said. “The Hessians will be surprised! They think no army will be marching on a night like this!”

“How do you know all this?” the major shouted above the storm. “How do you know what the Hessians are doing and thinking?”

“I—I—” For once, Annie seemed at a loss for words.

“She just guessed!” said Jack.

Just then, the bearded soldier who had yelled at Jack earlier stepped forward.



“I saw this boy earlier,” he said. “He was writing things down.”

“No, I was just … ” Now Jack was at a loss for words.

“Seize them!” the major shouted. “They’re spies!”

8. These Are the Times

Jack grabbed Annie’s hand.

“We’re not spies!” he said.

He whirled around to face George Washington.

“General Washington, remember those words you said to your men?” Jack said. “You should believe them yourself, sir!”

“What are you talking about?” George Washington asked.

Jack yanked the captain’s letter from his bag.



By the light of the lamp, he read the words the captain had copied for his children:

“ ‘These are the times that try men’s souls … ,’ ” Jack read. “ ‘But he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.… The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.’ ”

Jack looked at George Washington.

“Even if things look impossible, you should keep going, sir,” he said. “The harder things seem, the greater the triumph, right? That’s what you read to your men. You have to keep going for their sake.”

“Yes! And you have to keep going for our sake,” said Annie. “For the sake of the future children of America, sir.”

As the wet snow hissed about them, George Washington stared a long moment at Jack and Annie.

Finally, he put a hand on each of their shoulders.

“I do not know who you are,” he said. “I do not know how you know what you know. But I believe you. For your sake, and for the future children of America, we will march on.”

“Yay!” cried Annie.

“Yay,” said Jack softly. He sighed with relief and put away the captain’s letter.

“Now get back in the boat,” said George Washington. “You must leave the fighting to us. To me and my men.”

Jack felt very grateful to George Washington and his whole army. They were risking their lives for all of America’s children, past and future. He could barely speak.

“Thank you, sir,” said Annie.

“Thank you both for telling me to listen to my own advice,” said George Washington. He called to the rowers waiting in the boat. “Take good care of these two.”

George Washington climbed onto his horse. He looked down at Jack and Annie.

“Merry Christmas,” he said.

Then the commander-in-chief rode away into the stormy darkness.

9. Flash!

“All aboard!” one of the rowers called.

Jack and Annie hurried down the steep riverbank. They climbed back into the boat.

The crew pushed away from the shore. The boat started back through the icy, churning waters of the Delaware River.

Jack was freezing in the sleet and snow. But he didn’t worry about that now. He was thinking instead about how they had helped George Washington. He was thinking about how they had helped keep history on its course.

Jack felt great.

When they got to the riverbank, Jack and Annie jumped out of the boat.

“Thanks!” Jack yelled to the rowers.

With the wind at their backs, Jack and Annie took off through the blizzard. They ran down the icy bank of the Delaware River.

Thunder rumbled in the snowy sky.

Lightning zigzagged over the woods.

“How will we find the tree house?” cried Annie.

“I don’t know!” said Jack. “But don’t worry! We’ll find it!”

He felt very confident now, after meeting George Washington. After being thanked by George Washington!

He and Annie ran on through the rain and the snow and the sleet.

They ran along the riverbank—until a bright flash of lightning lit up the sky. Then Jack saw it!

The tree house was directly to their left, high in a tall tree covered with snow.



“Over there!” he shouted.

Jack and Annie ran toward the edge of the woods.

In the dark, Jack looked up, searching for the tree house.

Lightning lit the woods again. Jack saw the rope ladder flapping wildly in the wind.

He grabbed it.

“Annie!” he called.

“Here!” she said.

“Let’s go!” he said.

They climbed up the swaying ladder and scrambled into the tree house. They were soaking wet and covered with slush and snow.

Annie grabbed the Pennsylvania book.

“I wish we could go there!” she shouted.

The wind blew even harder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. This Peaceful Place

Gray early light spilled into the tree house.

Birds sounded in the woods.

The summer wind felt warm and gentle. Jack and Annie were wearing their nice, dry clothes again.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “It’s good to be home.”

“Yeah,” said Annie, sighing, “back in this peaceful place.”

Jack pulled the captain’s letter out of his pack. He turned it over. It was addressed to:

Molly and Ben Sanders

Apple Tree Farm

Frog Creek, Pennsylvania

“Molly and Ben lived on a farm near these woods over two hundred years ago,” said Jack.

Annie gently touched the letter.

“Your dad is going to make it home, kids. He misses you,” Annie whispered, as if she could send comforting words back through time.



Jack carefully placed the special writing from the Revolutionary War next to the writing from the Civil War.

“Look,” said Annie. She picked up a note lying in the corner. It said simply: Come back on Tuesday.

“Another message from Morgan,” said Annie.

Jack smiled.

He pulled on his pack.

“See you on Tuesday, tree house,” he said.

He started down the rope ladder. Annie followed.

In the early daylight, they ran through the Frog Creek woods. Then they ran down their street.

They climbed onto their porch and rested against the railing. They looked out at the dawn sky.

Jack remembered the whoosh of the cold wind on the Delaware. He remembered the hiss of the wet snow and the slosh of the icy waves.

He remembered George Washington reading to his men.

“The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph,” Jack whispered.

“Those words are true,” said Annie. “It was a hard conflict, and I feel kind of glorious right now. Don’t you?”

Jack laughed.

“Yeah, definitely,” he said.

Then he and Annie slipped into their quiet, peaceful house.

THE THIRTEEN COLONIES

Long ago, the United States was made up of thirteen small colonies. Many of the early settlers, or colonists, thought of England as their “mother country.” They were proud to have come from England, and they felt great loyalty to the British king.

Over time, though, many colonists wanted to be independent. They did not want a faraway country to rule over them. These colonists were called patriots.

THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND GEORGE WASHINGTON

In the spring of 1775, fighting broke out between the patriots and the British in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts.

That summer, a group of American patriots met in Philadelphia and began to organize an army to fight the British. They made George Washington their commander-in-chief.

After the patriots won independence over eight years later, Washington resigned as commander-in-chief. He returned to the life of a gentleman farmer on his plantation in Mount Vernon, Virginia.

Six years later, in 1789, George Washington was elected the first president of the United States.

THOMAS PAINE

At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, some colonists did not want to break away from England. These people were called Tories.

In January 1776, a British writer named Thomas Paine wrote a powerful essay that attacked the idea of obeying a king. Paine called his essay Common Sense. It inspired many Tories to join the patriots’ cause.

Almost a year later, in December 1776, George Washington’s army was losing the war. Many soldiers wanted to give up. This time Thomas Paine wrote a series of essays called The Crisis.

George Washington had The Crisis read aloud to his troops on the banks of the Delaware River.

Paine’s words inspired the troops to continue the fight. They crossed the Delaware River, defeated the enemy, and gave new hope to the whole patriot army.

Jack opened his eyes. Sunlight streamed through his window.

“Tuesday!” he whispered. Morgan’s note had told him and Annie to come back to the magic tree house on Tuesday. He could hardly wait to find out where she was sending them today!

Jack scrambled out of bed. He threw on his clothes. He packed his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he headed into the hall.

Jack bumped into Annie. She was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt.

“Tuesday!” they both whispered.

Together, they hurried down the stairs.

“Mom, Dad, we’re going out for a few minutes!” Jack shouted.

“Don’t you want breakfast first?” his dad called from the kitchen.

“When we get back!” said Annie.

They rushed out the front door. They ran down their street in the bright summer sunlight.

A warm wind gently shook the trees as Jack and Annie headed into the Frog Creek woods. Soon they came to the tallest tree in the woods. The magic tree house waited for them in the high branches. Jack and Annie grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up.

Inside the shady tree house, the note from Morgan was still on the floor:

Dear Jack and Annie,

Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:

Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend

Thank you,

Morgan

“Okay,” said Jack. “We have the first writing: something to follow.” He picked up a list from the Civil War.

“And we have the second,” said Annie, “something to send.” She picked up a letter from the Revolutionary War.

“Now we need the third,” said Jack, “something to learn.”

“No problem,” said Annie. She grabbed a book lying in the corner. “I hope we’re not going to another war.”

Jack and Annie looked at the cover. It showed a field of tall green grass.

The title was Life on the Prairie.

“The prairie?” said Annie. “We already went to the prairie the time we met Black Hawk.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, remembering their adventure with the Native American boy.

He opened the book and turned to a picture of an old-fashioned train crossing the prairie.

“Oh,” he said. “I get it. Trains crossed the prairie after the pioneers came. When we went to the prairie before, Native Americans were the only people who lived there.”

“So we must be going to pioneer time,” said Annie.

“I think so,” said Jack.

He pointed at the picture that showed the train crossing the prairie.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The breeze picked up.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

After I finished Magic Tree House® #22, Revolutionary War on Wednesday, I decided I wanted to write about pioneer times on the prairie frontier. As I always do, I went to the library for research. I read many nonfiction books about prairie pioneers. One day, I found a collection of true stories about women who had lived on the Kansas frontier in the late 1800s. When I read a passage about a tornado roaring toward a prairie schoolhouse, I got very excited. I’d always wanted to write about a tornado—and I’d been thinking about setting my new book in a prairie schoolhouse! Now I could combine these two ideas—and be true to real life.

I hope you’ll enjoy your journey with Jack and Annie to the Kansas frontier. But when the wind starts to blow—watch out!

All my best,

For Peter Boyce,

who likes to read about twisters





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie freed a mysterious little dog from a magic spell.

In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie have a new challenge. They must find four special kinds of writing for Morgan’s library to help save Camelot. They are about to set off to find the third of these.…



1. Tuesday!

Jack opened his eyes. Sunlight streamed through his window.

“Tuesday!” he whispered. Morgan’s note had told him and Annie to come back to the magic tree house on Tuesday. He could hardly wait to find out where she was sending them today!

Jack scrambled out of bed. He threw on his clothes. He packed his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he headed into the hall.

“Mom, Dad, we’re going out for a few minutes!” Jack shouted.

“Don’t you want breakfast first?” his dad called from the kitchen.

“When we get back!” said Annie.

They rushed out the front door. They ran down their street in the bright summer sunlight.

A warm wind gently shook the trees as Jack and Annie headed into the Frog Creek woods. Soon they came to the tallest tree in the woods. The magic tree house waited for them in the high branches. Jack and Annie grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up.

Inside the shady tree house, the note from Morgan was still on the floor:

“Okay,” said Jack. “We have the first writing: something to follow.” He picked up a list from the Civil War.

“And we have the second,” said Annie, “something to send.” She picked up a letter from the Revolutionary War.

“Now we need the third,” said Jack, “something to learn.”

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Signs of Life

Jack opened his eyes.

He was wearing pants with suspenders and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. In place of his backpack was a leather bag.

Annie was wearing a long dress and a sunbonnet.

“I like my hat,” she said. “It’ll keep the sun off my face.”

“Yeah, except the sun’s not shining,” said Jack.

He and Annie looked out the window.

The sky was cloudy.

The tree house had landed in a small grove of trees near a creek. Beyond the trees was a wide, open prairie. Green grass and wildflowers swayed in a chilly wind.

In the distance, a train puffed across the prairie. Sparks of fire came out of its smokestack. Huge clouds of black smoke billowed into the gray sky.

“Wow,” said Jack.



He looked at the picture of the train in their book and read:

After the Civil War, the U.S. government built railroads to link the eastern and western parts of the country. By the 1870s, steam engines carried people across the Kansas prairie.



Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:





“Let’s get going,” said Annie. “We have to find that special writing for Morgan.”

She started down the ladder.

Jack packed his things in his leather bag and climbed down after her.

When he stepped onto the ground, Jack looked toward the west.

The train was gone. Only a thin trail of smoke floated across the sky.

“That train was cool,” said Jack.

“Yeah, and so is that,” said Annie. She pointed in the other direction.

Far away, in the distance, a line of covered wagons rolled through the rippling grass. Their white coverings billowed in the breeze.

Jack pulled out the research book. He found a picture of the wagon train. He read aloud:

Wagons were the most common way for families to travel west. They could carry clothes, tools, food, and water. A line of wagons was called a “wagon train.” The white cloth coverings over the wagons also made them look like sailing ships, or schooners. For this reason, covered wagons were sometimes called “prairie schooners.”



Jack looked at the wagons again. They did look like ships sailing across a rippling green sea.



He wrote in his notebook:





“Let’s get a closer look,” said Annie.

She took off across the grass.

Jack put away his things and ran after her. As they ran, the wind began to blow harder. The clouds overhead grew darker.

“Wait—wait!” Jack finally called to Annie. “We’ll never catch up to it!”

They both stopped running. Panting, they watched the wagon train vanish over the horizon.

Jack took a deep breath.

“What now?” he said.

They looked around.

All Jack could see was the distant grove of trees with the tree house.

With the train and wagon train gone, there were no signs of life anywhere—no pioneer cabins, no Native American tepees.

“How can we find the special writing?” said Jack. “There’s nothing out here.”

“Oh yeah?” said Annie. “What’s that?”

She pointed to a rusty pipe sticking out from the top of a small hill.

Streaming from the pipe was a column of black smoke.

“Oh, man,” said Jack, “that’s definitely a sign of life.”



3. One-Room Schoolhouse

“Let’s check it out,” said Annie.

She and Jack walked up the little hill. At the top, they saw that the rusty pipe was rising out of a wooden roof.

They walked around to the other side of the hill.

Beneath the wooden roof was a door. The door seemed to open into the hill itself.

“What is this?” said Annie.

“Let’s find out,” said Jack.



He studied their research book until he found a black-and-white photograph. The photograph showed the same hill with the door.

Jack read aloud:

Since the prairie did not have many trees, wood was hard to find. So pioneers often made their houses out of sod bricks, which were blocks of earth cut out of the prairie. Sometimes a sod house was dug out of the side of a hill. It was called a “dugout.”



Jack pulled out his notebook. He wrote:





Then Jack read more to Annie:

Tornados, or twisters, are common on the prairie, so many dugouts had storm cellars. A storm cellar was like a rough basement below the ground. During a twister, a storm cellar is the safest place to be.



“Wow, maybe we’ll see a twister,” said Annie.

“I hope not,” said Jack. Then he read on:

A pioneer family built this dugout for a home. When they moved, the dugout became a schoolhouse. The schoolhouse had only one room. It also had a storm cellar beneath it.



Jack quickly wrote:





“Hey! This is the place!” said Annie.

Jack looked up from his writing.

“What place?” he asked.

“Where’s the best place to find our special writing—something to learn?” asked Annie.

Jack smiled.

“A school,” he said.

Annie ran to the wooden door and knocked loudly.

A moment later, the door creaked open. A girl peeked out. Her hair was in a tight bun, as if she were a grownup. But she didn’t look more than sixteen or seventeen years old.

“Hi, I’m Annie,” said Annie. “This is my brother, Jack.”

The girl opened the door wider.

“Hello, Jack and Annie,” she said. “I’m your teacher, Miss Neely.”

“You’re the teacher?” said Jack. Miss Neely seemed way too young to be a teacher.

“Yes!” she said, smiling. “Come in. You’re late.”



4. Reading Lesson

It was warm and dry inside the schoolhouse. Several oil lamps lit the darkness.

“Class, meet Annie and Jack,” the young teacher said.

What class? thought Jack.

There were only three kids.

On one bench sat a small boy and a girl. The boy looked about Annie’s age. The girl looked a little younger. On another bench sat a tall boy. He was tough-looking.

“Welcome to our first day of school,” said the young teacher.

“Today’s your very first day?” said Annie.

“Yes, and our first day in this dugout. The family who lived here left for California a week ago,” said Miss Neely.

Jack and Annie peered around the room. The walls were made of dirt. The floor was made of wood. It was covered by a worn rug.



Miss Neely’s desk was made from a barrel. A small coal stove was near her desk. A crate held a water jug, chalk, and two small blackboards.

“It’s a nice school,” Annie said politely.

“Thank you. We’re very grateful for it,” said Miss Neely. “And where do you live?”

“Well, we actually … ,” Jack started. Then he stopped—he wasn’t sure what to say.

“Actually, we don’t live around here,” Annie said. “We’re passing through.”

“You must be from the wagon train I saw this morning,” Miss Neely said.

Annie nodded.

Jack smiled.

Good work, Annie, he thought.

“We can only stay a little while,” he said.

“How exciting for you,” said Miss Neely. “Heading west on a wagon train. Where are you going?”

“California,” Annie said.

“California! That’s wonderful! Isn’t it, class?” Miss Neely said to the others.

“Yes, ma’am!” said the two younger children.

The older boy barely nodded.

“Have you ever been to school before?” Miss Neely asked Annie.

“Yes, ma’am,” Annie said. “We both know how to read and write. Jack’s one of the best readers you’ll ever meet.”

“My! Isn’t that wonderful, class?” said Miss Neely.

“Yes, ma’am!” said the younger children.

The older boy gave Jack a scowl.

“Not exactly the best,” Jack said modestly.

“I love to read,” said Miss Neely. “I’ll read any book I can get my hands on.”

“Me too,” said Jack.

“Then perhaps you’d like to start off our first reading lesson of the school year,” said Miss Neely.

“Sure,” said Jack.

“Sit with Jeb, then,” said Miss Neely, “and Annie, you sit with Kate and her brother, Will.”

Will and Kate quickly made room for Annie on their bench.

But Jeb didn’t move over for Jack, not even an inch.

Jack barely had room to sit. He took a deep breath and sat on the end of the bench.

Miss Neely handed Jack a book.

“This is our only reader,” she said. “It’s called the McGuffey Reader. Please read the first two lines of the poem on page fifty.”

“Oh, um … sure, ma’am,” said Jack.

He turned to page fifty. He pushed his glasses into place. Then he read aloud:

“Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

How I wonder what you are.”



“Very good!” said Miss Neely. “Now pass the reader to Jeb.”

Jack handed the book to Jeb.

“Jeb, please read the next two lines,” said Miss Neely.

The older boy cleared his throat and stared at the page.

“Maybe Jeb can’t read,” Will said in a kind voice to Miss Neely.

Jeb’s face got red.

“Shut up, Will,” he muttered.

“Oh!” said Miss Neely. She looked confused.

Jack felt sorry for Jeb. He wanted to give him some help.

Barely moving his lips, Jack whispered, “Up above the world so high, like a diamond—”

Jeb turned on Jack with an angry look.

“I don’t need your help,” he said.

“Now, Jeb, don’t get mad,” said Miss Neely. “And, Jack, you shouldn’t give people the answers.”

“I’m sorry,” said Jack.

Miss Neely sighed and pulled out her pocket watch. She was starting to look tired.

“Why don’t you all go outside and have your noon meal?” she said. “I’ll stay in and prepare for our next lesson.”

Miss Neely opened the door of the sod hut.

Annie, Kate, and Will bounced up from their seats and started cheerfully out of the schoolroom.

Jack turned to Jeb.

“Hey, sorry for what happened,” Jack said.

Jeb just glared at him and didn’t say anything.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie called outside the hut. “Kate wants us to eat with them!”

Jack hurried out the door. He didn’t look back at Jeb.



5. Bully

The air outside was strangely still. The dark clouds still hovered in the distance.

“Storm’s coming,” said Will.

“We have to eat quickly, before it starts to rain,” said Kate. She and Will sat down on the grass.

Annie and Jack sat beside them.

Will opened a small burlap sack. He took out four lumpy objects. They looked like dark rocks.

“Hey, there’s one here for each of us!” said Kate.

“One what?” asked Annie, frowning.

“Sweet potatoes!” said Will. He gave a potato each to Kate, Annie, and Jack.

“Um—no thanks,” said Jack, trying to give his back. “We don’t want to take your lunch.”

“We have enough! Keep it!” said Kate.

“What do you do with it?” asked Annie, holding up her potato.

Kate laughed.

“Just bite!” she said. “Like this—”

Kate and Will bit into their cold sweet potatoes as if they were apples.

“Cool,” said Annie. She took a big bite out of her potato, too.

But Jack just held on to his. He didn’t quite feel like eating the cold, brown potato.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jeb sitting by himself. The big kid didn’t seem to have any lunch at all.

Jack thought he’d try to be friends one more time.

“Hey, Jeb,” he called out. “I’m not hungry. You want my sweet potato?”



Jeb gave Jack a mean look.

“I could have brought my own lunch if I wanted to eat,” he said.

“Oh, sure,” said Jack.

Jeb narrowed his eyes.

“You making fun again?” he said. “I’m warning you. Do that one more time, and I’ll fight you.”

Jack couldn’t believe it. This kid took everything he said the wrong way!

“Hey!” Annie said. “Leave my brother alone. You’re nothing but a bully, Jeb.”

“Annie, stay out of this,” said Jack.

But Jeb just laughed. Then he stood up and walked back into the schoolhouse.

Jack felt angry. He hoped they would find the special writing soon so they could leave.

Will seemed to have read Jack’s mind.

“Don’t worry about him,” Will said to Jack. “He’s never been to school before.”

“Oh, so he’s embarrassed,” said Annie.

“Why hasn’t he been to school?” said Jack.

“Because he has to work in the fields all the time,” said Will.

“I heard him tell Miss Neely he walked five miles to get here today,” Kate said. “So he must have really wanted to come.”

“Wow,” said Annie. “How far did you and Will walk?”

“Only two,” said Kate.

“Two what?” asked Annie.

“Miles,” said Kate.

“Two miles,” Jack repeated.

The prairie kids nodded.

“It must be lonely living out here,” Annie said.

Will and Kate nodded again.

“Do you live in a sod house?” Jack asked.

“We used to,” said Will. “But it was always dirty. So our pa built us a log cabin.”

“He cut trees near the creek,” said Kate. “Then he made the cabin by hand.”

Before Annie or Jack could ask another question, thunder cracked in the sky. Then rain started to fall. It fell fast and hard.

Everyone jumped up.

“Come in! Come in!” Miss Neely called from the doorway.

They ran back inside. The wind slammed the door behind them with a BANG.



6. Grasshopper Attack?

Inside the lamplit hut, it was dry and cozy.

Jack sat back on his bench. He didn’t dare look at Jeb.

“It’s time for our writing lesson now,” Miss Neely said. “I’m going to give you each a slate and a pen.”

She handed out the slates. They looked like small blackboards set in wooden frames.

Next she gave everyone a slate pen. Each pen was a thin piece of chalk.

Miss Neely opened the McGuffey Reader.

“While you were eating your noon meal, I copied a poem from the book,” she said. “Now I want you to copy it.”

Miss Neely held her own slate board up for them all to see:





Jack quickly started copying the words. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jeb writing very slowly. It took the older boy a long time just to write the letter T.



Jack slowed down, too. He didn’t want Jeb to think he was showing off.

Suddenly, loud thumping sounds came from overhead. It sounded as if someone were throwing stones against the roof.

“Oh no! Grasshopper attack!” screamed Kate. She covered her head.

“Grasshopper attack!” cried Will. He covered his head, too.

“Be calm, everyone!” said Miss Neely.

What’s a grasshopper attack? What are they talking about? Jack wondered.

Even Jeb seemed worried. As Miss Neely started toward the door, he said, “Don’t open it! They’ll come in!”

Has everyone gone crazy? Jack thought. How can grasshoppers hurt anyone?

Miss Neely opened the door and looked out. A moment later, she stuck her head back in and closed the door.

“It’s all right,” she said. “It’s only hailstones.”

“What’s that?” said Annie.

“Hailstones are small pieces of frozen rain. Sometimes they fall to earth during a thunderstorm,” said Miss Neely.

“Why did Will and Kate yell, ‘Grasshopper attack!’?” Jack asked.

“Because last spring, grasshoppers did attack us,” said Miss Neely.

“Yes! Millions and millions of them came out of the sky,” said Will. “It looked like a huge, shiny cloud.”

“They covered every inch of ground!” said Kate. “They ate everything!”

“They ate all our crops,” said Will, “our turnips and fruit trees and watermelons.”

“They even ate our clothes and bedsheets!” said Kate.

“Yuck,” said Annie.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He’d never heard of a grasshopper attack before.

“It was very scary,” said Kate.

“But remember how we replanted and everyone helped everyone else?” said Miss Neely.

Kate and Will nodded.

“We must try to hold on to the good memories,” Miss Neely said gently, “and let go of the bad ones.”

“Yes, ma’am,” said Kate.

Everyone was quiet for a moment. Then the sound of the hailstones died away.

“Let’s go back to our lesson now,” said Miss Neely.

They all returned to their writing.

Even working as slowly as he could, Jack finished first. He showed his copy of the poem to Miss Neely.

“Good work, Jack,” she said. “We can all learn from these words, can’t we?”

“Yes, ma’am,” said Jack.

“Hey, this is it, Jack!” Annie blurted out. “Something to learn!”

Miss Neely looked puzzled.

But Jack smiled. He knew what Annie was talking about: They had their special writing. They could go home!

Jack stood up.

“Excuse me, ma’am, but I’m afraid we have to leave,” he said.

“So soon?” said Miss Neely.

“Yes, we have to go back to our parents,” said Annie.

“May I take my slate with us?” Jack asked.

“Please do,” said Miss Neely. “Use it on your trip to California to practice your writing.”

“Thanks!” said Jack with a big smile. He put the slate in his leather bag. “We learned a lot, ma’am.”

“I’m glad you had a chance to come to school,” said Miss Neely. “Good-bye and good luck.”

“Good luck to you, too,” said Annie.

“Bye!” Will and Kate called out.

“Bye!” said Jack and Annie.

As they went out the door, Jack glanced at Jeb. He felt sorry for the older boy. He tried one last time to be friends.

“Bye, Jeb,” he said.

But the boy wouldn’t even look at him.

Jack gently closed the door to the schoolhouse.

He breathed a sigh of relief. He was glad to get away from Jeb’s anger.

“That’s weird,” said Annie. “Look at the sky.”

As Jack turned away from the schoolhouse door, he caught his breath.

The sky did look weird—really weird.



7. Twister!

The black clouds had taken on an odd greenish color. They all seemed to be going in different directions.

“Do you think it’s a grasshopper attack?” Annie asked nervously.

“No, I think it’s some more weird weather, like that hailstorm,” said Jack. “Let’s go before it gets worse.”

As they started back to the tree house, the wind picked up.

Jack and Annie looked over their shoulders. The greenish clouds had dipped down close to the prairie.

“I feel like something awful is about to happen,” said Annie.

“Hurry!” said Jack. “Run!”

He and Annie started running through the grass. When they got to the ladder of the tree house, they looked back.

In the distance, twisting black clouds had dropped out of the storm clouds. They were swirling into a funnel shape.

The dark funnel started twisting across the prairie.

Jack’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest.

“It’s a twister!” he said.

“Oh no!” cried Annie.

The twister was whirling and tearing across the grass.



“Let’s get out of here!” said Jack. He grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

“Wait!” said Annie. “We have to help Miss Neely and the other kids!”

“They have a storm cellar!” Jack said. “That’s what our book said!”

“Yeah, but it’s only their first day in the dugout! They might not know about it!” said Annie. “There was a rug on the floor!”

Annie is right, Jack thought.

He looked up at the tree house. All they had to do was climb up and leave, and they’d be safe.

But what about Miss Neely? What about Will and Kate and Jeb?

“Okay!” said Jack. He jumped down from the ladder. “Let’s go back!”

He and Annie started running back toward the schoolhouse.

They ran as fast as they could across the prairie.

The roaring sound of the twister followed them.

Suddenly, the wind threw them to the ground!

Jack clutched the tall grass, trying to stand. When he got up, he grabbed Annie’s hand. He pulled her up, too.

With all his might, Jack held on to Annie and pulled her along.

The roaring twister came closer and closer.

The wind ripped up grass and earth around them. The roar grew deafening.

Jack and Annie could barely stay on their feet. Finally, they reached the dugout.

They tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge.

They banged on the door with their fists.

“Let us in!” Annie shouted.

No one opened the door.

“They can’t hear us!” yelled Jack.

But the sound of the twister drowned out his voice.



8. Get Below!

Suddenly, the schoolhouse door blew off its hinges! It went flying through the air!

Jack grabbed Annie and pulled her into the dugout.

Inside, the benches were overturned. The room was a mess.

Miss Neely and the three kids were pressed against the dirt wall. Kate and Will screamed as the winds whipped around the room.

Miss Neely hugged Kate. Jeb held on to Will.

“Get in the cellar!” Jack yelled.

“What cellar?” shouted Miss Neely.

Together, Jack and Annie pulled the rug off the floor and uncovered the cellar door.



They grabbed the door and tried to open it, but the wind was blowing too hard.

Suddenly, Jeb was beside them. He pulled the door open. A ladder led down into the cellar.

One by one, Will, Kate, Miss Neely, and Annie went down the ladder.

Jack waited for Jeb to go down.

“Go! Go!” Jeb shouted.

Jack climbed down into the cellar.

Jeb came last. He closed the door behind him, leaving everyone in total darkness.

The twister roared fiercely above them. It sounded like a train barreling right through the schoolhouse!

As the twister roared and howled, Jack couldn’t think. He couldn’t feel. He was totally swept up in the howl of the wind.

Then, just as Jack felt he would disappear in the roar of the twister, the noise died down.

And then it was silent.

No one spoke for a moment in the blackness. Then Annie broke the silence.

“Are we still alive?” she whispered.

Everyone laughed.

“Yes, I think we are,” said Miss Neely.



9. All Clear

Jeb pushed open the cellar door. Daylight streamed in. He looked out.

“All clear,” he said.

Jeb crawled out of the cellar. Jack followed him, then Annie, Will, Kate, and Miss Neely.

The sky was gray above them. The twister had torn the roof off the dugout and sucked everything out, even the rug.

They all stared in shock at the empty space.

Then Miss Neely smiled.

“Well, at least we are all safe,” she said.

They stepped out of the hut. The air was thick with dust and bits of grass.

The twister had cut a wide path of dirt and destruction across the prairie. It was still whirling away on the horizon.



Everyone watched silently as the twister became long and thin, like a piece of rope. Then it vanished completely.

Miss Neely turned to Jack and Annie.

“You saved our lives,” she said.

“Thank you!” said Will.

“Thank you!” said Kate, hugging Annie.

“Jeb actually opened the cellar door,” said Jack.

“Yes! Thank you, too, Jeb!” said Miss Neely.

The older boy only scowled.

“I hope you can get a new school,” said Annie.

“We will,” said Miss Neely. “Just as we planted our fields again after the grasshopper attack, we’ll build our school again after the twister. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”

Jack thought Miss Neely was one of the bravest people he’d ever met.

“You’re a good teacher,” he said shyly.

“I love teaching,” she said. “It’s a job that lasts forever. Whatever you teach children today travels with them far into the future.”

“That’s true!” said Annie.

Jack smiled.

“Well, we better leave—again,” he said.

“Bye!” Everyone waved, except Jeb.

Jack and Annie started across the prairie, back toward the tree house.

They hadn’t gone far when Jack heard someone shout his name. He turned around.

It was Jeb.

“Wait!” the older boy yelled. He had a fierce look on his face. He started running toward them.

“Oh no,” Jack breathed. Did Jeb still want to fight?

“Leave us alone!” Annie said angrily.

“Shh, Annie,” said Jack. “Let’s see what he wants.”

When Jeb got close to them, he stopped. He looked right at Jack.

“Why did you come back?” he asked.

“We wanted to tell you about the storm cellar,” said Jack.

“How did you know about that cellar?” Jeb said.

Jack pulled their research book out of his leather bag.

“We read about it in this book,” he said.

Jeb stared at the book. Then he sighed.



“I aim to read someday, too,” he said. “That looks like a good book.”

Jack didn’t know what to say. He was still afraid of making Jeb mad. So he just nodded.

“My ma and pa were too poor to go to school,” said Jeb. “They want me to go. But I’m getting started mighty late.”

“It’s not too late,” said Jack.

“It’s never too late,” said Annie.

Jeb narrowed his eyes.

“If you ever come back through here … ,” he said.

“Yes … ?” Jack asked carefully. Was Jeb about to threaten him again?

“Maybe I’ll be able to read that book of yours,” Jeb said.

Jack sighed and smiled.

“I know you will,” he said.

Jeb smiled back. He had a nice smile.

“Thanks for coming back to rescue us,” he said to both Jack and Annie. “Too bad you can’t stay. I reckon we’d all be good friends if you did.”

“I reckon we would,” said Annie.

Jeb nodded. Then he turned and ran back to join the others.

Suddenly, the sun broke through the clouds. The wildflowers danced in a gentle breeze.

“Ready?” said Annie.

Jack just stood there, staring at the sunlit prairie.

“Jack? Ready to go?” Annie asked.

In that moment, Jack actually hated to leave. But he nodded slowly and said, “Let’s go.”

He and Annie took off through the bright, sparkling grass. They ran to the small grove of trees near the creek.

They climbed up the rope ladder and scrambled into the tree house.

Annie picked up their Pennsylvania book.

“I wish we could go there,” she said.

This time the wind did not start to blow.

The tree house simply started to spin on its own.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



10. The Third Writing

Jack opened his eyes.

Morning light filled the tree house.

He and Annie were wearing their own clothes again.

“Home,” said Annie, smiling.

Jack looked out the window.

He saw their nice, cozy house in the distance, their lawn, their sidewalk, their paved street.

“Life here is pretty easy compared to pioneer life,” said Jack.

“We’re lucky,” said Annie.

Jack reached into his bag and pulled out the small slate.

“Our third writing,” he said. He added the poem to the list from the Civil War and the letter from the Revolutionary War.

“You did just what that poem says you should do,” said Annie.

“What do you mean?” Jack asked.

“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,” Annie said. “You kept trying to make friends with Jeb. In the end, you did.”

“I guess you’re right,” said Jack.

“We have to get only one more special writing for Morgan’s library,” said Annie.

“I wonder how that will help save Camelot?” said Jack.

Annie shrugged.

“It’s a mystery,” she said.

She and Jack looked around the tree house.

“Look—” Annie picked up a piece of paper lying in the corner. She read aloud:



Come back early Wednesday morning.

“Wednesday? Man, that’s tomorrow!” said Jack.

“So?” said Annie. She started down the rope ladder.

“Not much time to recover,” said Jack, pulling on his backpack.

“Recover from what?” Annie said.

“The twister,” said Jack.

“Oh yeah, I’d almost forgotten about that,” said Annie.

Jack smiled.

Actually, the nightmare of the twister was fading from his memory, too.

We must try to hold on to the good memories, Miss Neely had said, and let go of the bad ones.

The kindness of Will and Kate, making friends with Jeb, the courage of Miss Neely—these memories, Jack thought, he would never forget.





MORE FACTS ABOUT TWISTERS

• Twisters, or tornados, are the fastest winds on earth.

• Twisters can travel at speeds up to 200 miles per hour.

• The spinning winds act like a giant vacuum cleaner as they move across the earth.

• Almost 1,000 tornados hit the United States each year.





MORE FACTS ABOUT

PIONEER LIFE ON THE PRAIRIE

From the mid-1800s through the 1880s, thousands of pioneers traveled by wagon across America. Most were headed for the territories of Oregon and California. But a number stopped and settled on the Kansas frontier. They made dugouts and broke up the hard ground to plant crops. These pioneers faced windstorms and dust storms, a shortage of water, and grasshopper plagues. In spite of the hardships, they set up small schools so their children could learn the three R’s: “reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic.” Children of varied ages often learned together. It was not unusual for teachers to be as young as 15 or 16 years old.





MORE FACTS ABOUT

PIONEER SCHOOLBOOKS

The most popular American schoolbooks of the 1880s were called McGuffey Readers. They were put together by a schoolteacher from Ohio named William Holmes McGuffey. Poems such as “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” and “If at First You Don’t Succeed” became part of American life because they were in the McGuffey Readers.

Webster’s Spelling Book was another sig-nificant reference in early American schools. It taught people who’d come here from all over the world how to spell words in the English language.

Jack sat up in bed. He stared out his window.

The sky was dark gray. The sun would be rising soon.

“It’s almost time,” he whispered to himself.

The day before, in the magic tree house, Morgan’s note had said, “Come back tomorrow, in the early morning.”

Jack jumped out of bed. He put on his jeans and T-shirt. Then he grabbed his backpack and crept out into the hall.

Jack peeked into Annie’s room. She wasn’t there. He slipped downstairs and out the front door.

Annie was sitting on the porch steps. Jack sat down beside her.

“What are you doing?” he asked.

“I was waiting for the birds to start singing,” said Annie. “Then I was going to wake you up.”

Jack and Annie watched the sky go from dark gray to light gray. Then the birds began their song.

“Tweet-tweet,” said Annie.

Without another word, Jack and Annie left their porch. They headed up their street to the Frog Creek woods.

It was cool beneath the trees. Jack and Annie hurried through the woods to the rope ladder. It hung from the tallest oak. At the top of the oak was the magic tree house.

They climbed up into the tree house. It was barely light inside.

Annie picked up the note lying on the floor. She held it up to the window and read aloud:

Dear Jack and Annie,

Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:





Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend





Thank you,

Morgan

Jack took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he said. “We have our first special writing: a list from the Civil War.”

“We have the second,” said Annie, “a letter from the Revolutionary War.”

“We have the third,” said Jack, “a poem from a pioneer schoolhouse.”

“Now we just need one more,” said Annie.

“I wonder why we have to find these special writings for Morgan’s library,” said Jack. “How are they going to save Camelot?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But let’s get going so we can solve the mystery. Where’s our research book?”

They looked around the tree house.

Their Pennsylvania book, the book that always brought them home, was lying in the corner. Beside it was another book. Annie picked it up.

“This is it,” she said softly. She showed the book’s cover to Jack. It said:

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, 1906

“California?” said Jack. “I’ve always wanted to go to California.”



“Me too,” said Annie. She laughed. “I guess I told Miss Neely the truth after all.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling.

The magic tree house had taken them to a pioneer school in their last adventure. There, Annie had told the teacher, Miss Neely, that they were on their way to California.

Annie pointed at the cover of the California book.

“We really wish we could go there,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,





When I write a Magic Tree House book, I draw from three sources: my imagination, my research, and my own experience. While working on this book, my imagination came up with the idea of Jack and Annie visiting San Francisco during the earthquake of 1906. My research gave me information about the actual event. And my own experience inspired me to put my nephews, Andrew and Peter, into the story. Fortunately, my nephews and I have never been through an earthquake together, but we’ve shared many adventures, so it was fun to imagine them meeting Jack and Annie.

Fun—that’s the magic word for me. Writing a story should always be fun. At the same time, it requires lots of work, such as rewriting and rewriting. I rewrite one Magic Tree House book many times, but I always try to have fun while I’m doing it.

As I’ve said before, I hope you’ll try writing your own stories. You might want to check out our Readers & Writers Club on the Magic Tree House Web site. The address is listed on the back of this book. Find out where your imagination, your research, and your own experiences lead you. But watch out—you might end up in the middle of an earthquake!

All my best,

For Chi Hyon,

Andrew and Peter’s mother





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie freed a mysterious little dog from a magic spell.

In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie have a new challenge. They must find four special kinds of writing for Morgan’s library to help save Camelot. They are about to set off to find the third of these … .


1. Tweet-tweet



Jack sat up in bed. He stared out his window.

The sky was dark gray. The sun would be rising soon.

“It’s almost time,” he whispered to himself.

The day before, in the magic tree house, Morgan’s note had said, “Come back tomorrow, in the early morning.”

Jack jumped out of bed. He put on his jeans and T-shirt. Then he grabbed his backpack and crept out into the hall.

Jack peeked into Annie’s room. She wasn’t there. He slipped downstairs and out the front door.

Annie was sitting on the porch steps. Jack sat down beside her.

“What are you doing?” he asked.

“I was waiting for the birds to start singing,” said Annie. “Then I was going to wake you up.”

Jack and Annie watched the sky go from dark gray to light gray. Then the birds began their song.

“Tweet-tweet,” said Annie.

Without another word, Jack and Annie left their porch. They headed up their street to the Frog Creek woods.

It was cool beneath the trees. Jack and Annie hurried through the woods to the rope ladder. It hung from the tallest oak. At the top of the oak was the magic tree house.

They climbed up into the tree house. It was barely light inside.

Annie picked up the note lying on the floor. She held it up to the window and read aloud:

Dear Jack and Annie,

Camelot is in trouble. To save the kingdom, please find these four special kinds of writing for my library:





Something to follow

Something to send

Something to learn

Something to lend





Thank you,

Morgan

Jack took a deep breath.

“Okay,” he said. “We have our first special writing: a list from the Civil War.”

“We have the second,” said Annie, “a letter from the Revolutionary War.”

“We have the third,” said Jack, “a poem from a pioneer schoolhouse.”

“Now we just need one more,” said Annie.

“I wonder why we have to find these special writings for Morgan’s library,” said Jack. “How are they going to save Camelot?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But let’s get going so we can solve the mystery. Where’s our research book?”

They looked around the tree house.

Their Pennsylvania book, the book that always brought them home, was lying in the corner. Beside it was another book. Annie picked it up.

“This is it,” she said softly. She showed the book’s cover to Jack. It said:

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, 1906

“California?” said Jack. “I’ve always wanted to go to California.”



“Me too,” said Annie. She laughed. “I guess I told Miss Neely the truth after all.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling.

The magic tree house had taken them to a pioneer school in their last adventure. There, Annie had told the teacher, Miss Neely, that they were on their way to California.

Annie pointed at the cover of the California book.

“We really wish we could go there,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Thunder Under the Ground

“Nice clothes,” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

Annie was wearing a blue-and-white dress with a big sailor collar and white stockings.

Jack was wearing brown knee-length pants, a jacket, a cap, and a tie. His backpack had become a leather bag. He and Annie both wore short lace-up boots.

A church bell started to ring.

Gong. Gong. Gong. Gong. Gong.

“It rang five times,” said Jack. “It must be five in the morning.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. She was looking out the window.

Jack looked with her. The early-morning air felt fresh and cool.

The tree house had landed in a tree at the bottom of a hill. Painted wooden houses and gaslights lined a quiet cobblestone street. A trolley car moved along tracks up the street. It rounded the top of the hill and disappeared.

Tall buildings towered farther off. The sun was behind them, making pink streaks in the blue sky.



“It’s really pretty here,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

He opened the research book and read:

On Wednesday, April 18, 1906, San Francisco was the biggest city on the west coast of the United States. It had a population of half a million people. It was also one of the loveliest cities in the country.



Jack pulled out his notebook. He wrote:





“Let’s go!” Annie said impatiently.

Jack looked back at the book. He wanted to learn more.

“Now,” said Annie. She took the book and notebook away from him and put them into his leather bag. “Let’s not waste any more time.”

Annie left the tree house.

“Doing research is not wasting time,” Jack called after her.

But he slung his bag over his shoulder and followed Annie down the rope ladder. When they had both stepped onto the grass, Jack looked around.

“Where to?” he said.

“Anywhere!” said Annie. “Let’s just explore and see the sights. We can be tourists.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “But don’t forget we have to find the writing for Morgan’s library.”

They started up the cobblestone street. As they walked up the steep hill, the sun rose above the tall buildings.

The early light turned everything to gold: stones, streetlamps, and the glass windows of the silent houses.

“It’s so quiet and peaceful,” said Annie.

“Yeah, everyone must still be sleeping,” said Jack.

Suddenly, out of the quiet came a deep rumbling noise.

Jack stopped. He grabbed Annie’s arm.

“What’s that?” he said.

The noise got louder. It sounded like thunder coming from under the ground.

The earth started shaking.



Church bells clanged wildly.

The whole street began to move. The cobblestones rolled like waves on the ocean.

“What’s happening?” Annie cried.

Chimneys fell off roofs!

Gaslights toppled over!

Bricks crashed to the street!

“Get down!” shouted Jack. “Cover your head!”

Jack and Annie crouched on the ground with their arms over their heads. All around them was rumbling, clanging, crashing, and breaking.

Then the world grew still. The rumbling stopped.

Jack and Annie raised their heads. The air was filled with dust.

“It’s over,” said Jack.

“That must have been an earthquake!” said Annie.

“I think so,” Jack agreed.

“I guess I should have let you do a little more research on this place,” Annie said.

“Yeah, probably,” said Jack. “Except I don’t know exactly what we could have done.”

Jack slowly stood up. His legs felt wobbly. As he brushed off his pants, the deep rumbling came again—louder than before.

Then the terrible shaking started. It was even harder than before.

Jack was hurled to the ground. The earth trembled and quaked. Jack bounced against the hard cobblestones.

“Annie!” he cried.

He tried to stand, but fell again. Through the dusty air, he saw the tall buildings swaying against the sky!

Roofs were caving in!

Up and down the street, bricks, glass, and concrete showered down!

It seemed like a long time before the dreadful noise and shaking finally stopped.



3. The Great Shake

A cloud of dust billowed around Jack. He could hardly breathe. He couldn’t see. But he could hear Annie coughing.

Jack opened his mouth to call to her. But dust filled his throat.

“Jack!” Between coughs, Annie shouted his name. “Jack!”

“I’m here!” he said hoarsely.

“I think I’m in trouble,” she said.

Jack tried to sit up. He hurt all over. His clothes were ripped and covered with dirt. His cap was gone.

“Where are you?” he called.

“Here!” said Annie.

Jack started to stand. But he fell down again. His legs were like rubber.

“Wh-where?” he repeated. Jack cleaned his glasses, then looked around. But he still couldn’t see Annie through the thick haze of dust.

“I fell into the ground!” said Annie.

Jack crawled in the direction of Annie’s voice.

“Keep talking,” he said.

“Here”—she coughed—“here!”

Jack felt a ledge with his hands. He looked down into a huge crack in the street. Through the dust, he could see Annie right below him.

“You found me!” she said between coughs.

“I’ll pull you out,” said Jack.

He grabbed Annie’s hands. He tried to pull her out of the crack, but she was too heavy.

“I can’t do it,” he said.

“Bring me something to stand on,” Annie said. “Maybe I can get out by myself.”

Jack stood up and stumbled away from the crack. He gathered an armload of bricks. Then he went back to the crack and handed them down to Annie, one by one.

Annie carefully stacked the bricks on top of each other.

“I need more,” she said.

Jack ran to get more bricks. He was afraid there’d be another earthquake and the crack would close—with Annie inside!

He handed the bricks down to her.

“Hurry!” he said.

“I’m hurrying,” she said.

At last, Annie finished stacking the bricks. She stood on the stack. With her bare hands, she slowly pulled herself up.



Jack helped her stand. She was covered with dirt. Her stockings were torn. Her knees were skinned.

“Are you hurt?” Jack asked.

“A little scraped,” said Annie. “How about you?”

“A little shaky,” said Jack. Actually, he was very shaky.

“Me too,” said Annie.

“I think San Francisco just had a really huge earthquake,” Jack said. He coughed. His throat was clogged with dust.

Annie coughed, too.

“What’s the book say?” she said.

Jack pulled his research book out of his leather bag. His hands were trembling. He could hardly turn the pages.

“I’ll find it,” said Annie. She took the book from him and found a picture of a torn-up street.

She read aloud:

At 5:13 A.M. on April 18, 1906, the people of San Francisco were shaken awake by one of the biggest earthquakes the United States has ever known. Some called it “the Great Shake.”



“No wonder we feel shaky,” said Jack.

“I wonder if a lot of people got hurt,” said Annie.

They looked around. Through the dust-filled air, families were stumbling out of their crumbling houses. They all were barefoot and still wore their nightclothes.

Some babies and small children were crying. But strangely, the grown-ups were all silent. They just stared at the torn-up street and crumbling houses.

“Everyone must be in shock,” said Annie.

“I know how they feel,” said Jack. He gazed at the rubble all around them. He didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t think clearly.

Annie looked at the book again. She read aloud:

Just after the earthquake, broken chimneys, stoves, and lamps caused terrible fires. The fires raged for three days, nearly destroying all of San Francisco. Over 28,000 buildings burned down.



“That’s terrible,” breathed Jack.

In the distance, a cloud of black smoke was rolling through the sky.

“The fires are starting!” said Annie.



4. What’s the Story?

“Maybe we should leave,” Jack said in a panic. He wanted to get out of San Francisco before the fires spread.

“We can’t,” said Annie. “We have to find our special writing for Morgan’s library, something to lend.”

“Let’s find it fast,” said Jack.

He and Annie started walking through the rubble. They stepped over piles of bricks, chunks of concrete, and broken glass.



They passed fallen lamps and twisted trolley-car tracks.

They saw houses leaning to one side and people hauling their things out to the street.

“We can’t worry about our mission now,” Annie said. “We have to help.”

“Help? How?” said Jack. He was so shaky, he didn’t think he could be much help to anyone.

“What about them?” said Annie.

She pointed to some men frantically dragging bags out of a building and piling them into a horse-drawn wagon.

Annie ran over to the wagon.

“What are you doing?” she asked the men.

“We’re trying to get these bank bags down to the harbor,” said the wagon driver. “So a boat can take them out into the bay.”

“Why?” asked Jack.

“So we can save everyone’s money from the fires!” the man said.

He pointed at the sky. The cloud of smoke was growing bigger and blacker.

“Can we help?” asked Annie.

“We’re done,” said the driver. “You kids run home to your parents. Then get out of the city.”

Jack wished he and Annie could ride with the driver down to the bay and be safe from the fires, too. But he could see the wagon didn’t have room for them.

“Good luck!” said Annie.

“Don’t forget what I told you!” the driver said. Then he and his horses took off. The wagon turned onto the main street and disappeared over the hill.

“I wonder who we can help?” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath.

“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe I’ll take some notes.”

Jack pulled out his notebook. In wobbly handwriting, he wrote:





“Hey, what’s the story?” a woman asked. Her voice sounded urgent.

Jack looked up.

A man and woman stood in front of them. The woman wore a long dress and carried a notebook. The man wore a suit. He carried a big camera and a three-legged stand.



“What story?” said Annie.

“The story with the bank. My name’s Betty. I’m a reporter,” said the woman.

“For television?” asked Annie.

“What’s that?” said Betty.

“Never mind,” said Jack. He whispered quickly to Annie, “She’s a newspaper reporter. TV hasn’t been invented yet.”

“Oops,” said Annie.

“So what’s the story with the wagon that just left the bank?” Betty asked Jack and Annie.

Jack looked down at his notebook.

“They’re going to save the money by taking it to the bay and putting it on a boat,” he said.

“Good reporting work, sonny!” she said. “Get a picture of the bank, Fred.”

The photographer set his camera on the stand. He put his head under a black curtain and took a picture.

“Got it,” said Fred.

As the photographer packed up his equipment, Betty turned to Jack and Annie.

“Go home and get your parents, kids,” she said. “Fires are burning out of control.”

“We know,” said Annie. “By the end of three days, the fires will burn down nearly all of San Francisco.”

Betty looked curious. “How do you know that?” she asked.

“She’s just guessing,” Jack said quickly.

“Pretty gloomy guess,” said Betty. “Tell your folks not to catch the ferry. Thousands are crowding into the ferry building. Go to Golden Gate Park.”

“Thanks for the tip,” said Annie.

“Thanks for the story,” said Betty. Then she and Fred hurried away.

Jack and Annie looked around.

Now many people seemed to be fleeing their homes. Some were going up the hill. Some were going down.

An old woman was pushing a wheelbarrow filled with pots and pans. A girl was carrying a suitcase and a cat. A boy was carrying a birdcage and a fishbowl.

“They’re all going in different directions,” said Annie.

“I wonder where Golden Gate Park is,” said Jack. “Maybe we should go there. Let’s see if there’s a map in our book.”

Jack looked in their research book. He found a map of San Francisco.

“Where are we now?” he said.

As he looked for a street sign, he saw a man carrying an armload of books out of a beautiful building. The man put the books into the back of a horse-drawn wagon.

“What’s he doing?” asked Jack.

“I bet he’s saving those books,” said Annie.

“Saving books?” said Jack. He loved books. For a moment, Jack forgot his fears. He forgot about trying to save himself.

“We’d better help,” he said. “Come on!”



5. Stop! Stop!

Jack and Annie ran up the street to the book wagon. The man was carefully stacking the books in the back of the wagon. He was covered with dust and his glasses were cracked.

“Hey, what’s the story?” Annie asked the man.

Jack couldn’t help smiling. Annie sounded just like the newspaper reporter.

“I’m moving all the rare books to the Pavilion,” the man said.

“Can we help?” asked Jack.

“Sure, there are only a few left by the door,” said the man. “Grab ’em! Hurry! The fires on Market Street will soon be blowing this way.”

Jack and Annie ran into the building. Near the door were two small stacks of books.

Jack and Annie each gathered up a stack. The books looked very old and fancy. Some even had sparkling gold on their covers.

“Wow,” whispered Jack.

He and Annie carried the books outside.

“Careful, please!” said the man. “All these books are treasures—ancient Bibles and hand-painted books.”



The man carefully took the books from Jack’s and Annie’s arms and put them in the back of the wagon.

“Thanks,” he said, pushing his hat back. “Run home now! The fires will be here soon!”

As the horses started up the hill, Annie waved and shouted, “Good luck!”

“I bet he was the librarian,” said Jack.

He opened his research book. He looked for a photograph of the building that had the books.

“Here it is,” he said. He read aloud:

People tried to save special things. But they did not always succeed. Rare books from a library were moved to the Pavilion building. When the Pavilion building caught fire, all the books burned. The building that originally held them did not burn at all.



“Oh no!” cried Jack. “Stop! Stop!”

Clutching the research book, he ran after the wagon. Annie ran with him.

“Stop! Stop!” they both yelled. They ran as fast as they could over the broken cobblestones and up the steep hill.

Near the top, the driver finally heard them. He brought his wagon to a halt.

“You can’t go to the Pavilion!” Jack cried.

“You have to take them back to the building where they were!” said Annie.

“They won’t burn there!” said Jack, trying to catch his breath. “The building you’re taking them to is going to burn instead!”

The driver looked at Jack and Annie as if they were crazy.

“You kids need to worry about yourselves, not these books,” he said. “Go home to your parents. I’ll take care of the library.”

Then the man snapped his reins and went on over the hilltop.

“Come back!” Jack cried.

They watched helplessly as the wagon bumped down the street, over the rubble. Smoke billowed up from the bottom of the hill.

“I can’t believe it,” Jack said. He was close to tears.

“We tried, but we couldn’t save them,” said Annie. She touched Jack’s shoulder gently.

“All those books … ” His voice trailed off.

“Hey,” said Annie. “Someone’s crying over there—someone with two kids. Maybe we can help them.”



6. Something to Lend

A woman in a blue bathrobe was sitting on a crumbling stone wall. She was sobbing into her handkerchief.

Two boys with dark hair sat next to the woman. The boys wore dusty, torn pajamas. They were both barefoot. The younger one was watching the older boy write on a rectangular piece of wood with a chunk of coal.

Annie pulled Jack over to the family.

“Hi, I’m Annie,” she said.

The two boys looked up.

“I’m Peter,” said the youngest. “He’s my brother, Andrew. And she’s our aunt Mary.” He pointed to his brother, then to the woman, as he spoke.

Aunt Mary tried to smile through her tears.

“Forgive me,” she said. “I’m a bit shaken up.”

“We are, too,” said Annie sympathetically.

“The house caught fire,” Peter said.

“We escaped,” said Andrew. “But we lost most of our things.”

“We’ve lost our shoes,” said Peter.

Jack and Annie looked at the boys’ bare feet. They were cut and bleeding.



“Hey, my boots are just like boys’ boots,” Annie said. “One of you can wear them.”

“Take mine, too,” said Jack. He and Annie started unlacing their boots.

“We can’t just take your boots,” said Andrew.

“Then we’ll lend them to you,” said Jack.

He and Annie handed their boots to the two boys.

“Thank you, thank you,” said Aunt Mary. She started crying again.

The two boys put their new boots on. Then Peter whispered something to Andrew.

Andrew held out the piece of wood to Jack and Annie.

“Here’s something we can lend you,” he said.

Jack and Annie read a poem the brothers had written on the piece of wood:



“Thanks,” said Annie.

“It’s a great gift,” said Jack. “We needed some hope.”

“It’s the only thing we can lend you,” said Andrew.

“Lend?” said Annie. She looked at Jack. “Oh, wow. They just gave us the special writing—something to lend!”

Jack smiled. They could go home now.

“You should go to Golden Gate Park—that’s what a reporter told us,” he said to the boys and their aunt.

“Is that where you’re going?” asked Aunt Mary. She had stopped crying at last and looked stronger.

“We have to go home to our parents,” said Annie.

“Will you be safe?” asked the aunt.

“Yes. Once we’re home, we’ll be safe,” said Jack.

“Thanks for lending us your boots!” said Peter. “You’re good friends!”

“You’re good friends!” said Annie.

“You’ve helped us more than you know,” said Jack.

“Be careful,” said Aunt Mary.

“We will!” said Jack and Annie.

They waved as their new friends headed off to the park.

Jack sighed.

“Ready?” he said.

“Yeah,” said Annie. “I guess we just go back the way we came.”

Jack looked down the street. Smoke billowed up from the bottom of the hill.

“That might not be as easy as it sounds,” he said.



7. Dynamite!

“We’d better be careful,” said Annie.

They stepped in their sock feet over the broken cobblestones, trying not to cut themselves.

They headed down the hillside. On their way, they passed policemen carrying stretchers with injured people on them.

They passed soldiers directing all those trying to escape the fires.

One man was trying to push a piano down the street. Another man was wearing a bunch of hats, all piled on top of one another. A woman carried her three little dogs in a bag.

“Everyone’s trying to save what’s important to them,” said Annie.

“Like the librarian,” said Jack. “And us—we’re trying to save this sign.” He clutched the piece of wood.

When they were halfway down the hill, a soldier on a horse galloped in front of them.

“Get off the street! We’re setting off dynamite!” he shouted.

“Dynamite?” said Jack.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

People started running in all directions. Jack and Annie looked around wildly for a safe place to go. Jack saw an alley.

“There!” he said.

They ran into the alley and crouched on the ground.

Jack reached into his bag for their research book. He looked in the index for the word “dynamite.” He found it. Then he turned to the right page number and read:

After the fires started, the mayor had an idea. He thought that if some buildings were destroyed, the sparks would not fly from one wooden roof to the next. He ordered some buildings to be blown up by dynamite. His plan did not work. The firestorm raged from building to building, from street to street.



Firestorm, Jack thought. The word sounded terrible.

Just as he put the book away, a huge blast of dynamite shook the ground.

Dust and dirt flew everywhere, even down the alley.

Jack clutched their sign with one hand. He covered his eyes with the other. Annie did the same.

Another huge blast rocked the ground.

Jack tasted grit in his mouth. He looked at Annie. She was caked with dust from head to toe. He looked down at himself. He was just as dirty as she was.

“Hey, would you look at those two!” someone said. “Now, that’s a story!”

Jack looked up. Betty, the newspaper reporter, and Fred, the photographer, were standing in front of them.

Even though they were also covered with dirt, Fred was setting up his camera. And Betty was taking notes in her notebook.

“Hold up your sign, sonny,” said Betty.

Too stunned to say anything, Jack held up the sign with the poem about hope.

Fred took a picture.



Another dynamite blast shook the ground.

“Come with us! We’re headed for the park!” said Betty.

“We can’t. We’re on our way home, to our parents,” said Annie.

“Well, get going! And be careful!” said Betty. “Let’s beat it, Fred!”

The photographer grabbed his camera equipment, and the two of them rushed off.

“I don’t think Betty and Fred recognized us,” said Annie.

“I don’t recognize us,” said Jack.

Another blast shook the ground.

“Come on,” said Annie. “Let’s beat it!”

Jack and Annie jumped up. Jack put their sign in his bag. Then they started back down the hill.



8. Good Luck, San Francisco!

Jack and Annie ran over the cobblestones. Dynamite blasts echoed behind them.

They headed back down the hill. Flames shot across the roofs, traveling from one house to another.

“We’re heading right into the firestorm!” Jack shouted over the noise.

“We have to keep going,” Annie shouted back, “before the tree house catches fire!”

At the bottom of the hill, thick smoke was rolling through the street. It made Jack’s eyes burn.

“Where’s the tree house?” he shouted.

“Here!” said Annie.

Jack followed her voice.

She was holding on to the rope ladder.

“It’s still here!” Jack said with relief.

“Of course. The tree house wouldn’t leave without us,” said Annie. “Don’t you—”

“Go! Go!” said Jack.

Annie started up the rope ladder. Jack followed. They climbed into the tree house and looked out the window.

All around, buildings were going up in flames. Black smoke seemed to be smothering the city.

Jack could scarcely breathe. His throat burned. His eyes were stinging.

Annie grabbed their Pennsylvania book. She opened it to the picture of Frog Creek and pointed.

“I wish we could go there,” she said. “Good luck, San Francisco!”

“Good-bye, San Francisco!” said Jack.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



9. The Wonderful Room

The songs of early-morning birds filled the woods.

Jack opened his eyes and sighed.

They were back in Frog Creek. He could breathe again. His eyes didn’t sting anymore. He was wearing his own clothes, even his sneakers.

“I wonder what happened to everyone?” Annie asked anxiously. “Andrew, Peter, and their aunt, and Betty and Fred, and all the other people.”

Jack pulled out their research book. He turned to the last chapter. He read aloud:

After the earthquake fires were put out, people from all over the world sent help to San Francisco. The brave citizens of the city never gave up hope. Many even wore badges that said, “Let’s rebuild at once.” In less than ten years, San Francisco was once again one of the loveliest cities in the United States.



“Oh, good,” breathed Annie. “Hey, do you have our sign?”

Jack reached again into his pack. He pulled out the sign from Peter and Andrew.

He placed it on the floor, next to the list from the Civil War, the letter from the Revolutionary War, and the slate from the pioneer schoolhouse.

“We have all four writings now,” he said.

“So what happens next?” said Annie.

Suddenly, there was a roar. A bright light flashed through the tree house.

Jack covered his face. When he peeked over the tops of his fingers, he saw Morgan le Fay.

“Morgan!” Jack and Annie cried joyfully.

They both hugged her.

Morgan hugged them back.

“We found the four special writings for your library!” said Jack.

Annie picked up the list and the letter. Jack picked up the slate and the sign.

“Here they are!” he said.

They started to give everything to Morgan. But she held up her hand.

“Do not give them to me,” she said. “Someone else needs them more.”

Suddenly, a blinding light flashed through the tree house again. There came a great roar, then silence.

When Jack and Annie opened their eyes, they were no longer in the magic tree house.

They were standing in a huge, shadowy room. The room smelled wonderful—like leather, books, and a wood-burning fire.

Flames crackled in a huge stone hearth. Along the walls were rows and rows of tall bookcases filled with books.

“Welcome to my library,” Morgan said softly.

“Wow,” whispered Jack.

“Someone here is waiting to meet you,” said Morgan. “I told him that two special messengers would soon arrive.”

“Where is he?” asked Annie.

Morgan pointed to a man dressed in dark blue in a corner of the library. He sat in a chair. His head was bowed. His hair was black streaked with silver.

“He looks tired,” Annie whispered.

“Yes, he and his knights have been defeated,” Morgan said quietly. “He has given up all hope for his kingdom.”

“How can we help him?” asked Annie.

Morgan looked down at the special writings that Jack and Annie held.

“Would it help if we showed him these?” Jack asked.

Morgan smiled.

“Come on, let’s show him!” said Annie.

They crossed the room and knelt before the tired-looking man.

“Excuse me,” Annie said.

The man looked up. He had sad gray eyes.

“We’re Morgan’s messengers. We’ve come to help,” said Jack.

The man shook his head.

“I don’t understand,” he said in a deep, tired voice. “You are children. How can you help?”



“Sometimes children can help a lot,” said Annie. “Jack and I have helped a general, and we helped wounded soldiers.”

“We helped people caught in an earthquake and a twister,” Jack added.

The man straightened up a little. “That is brave,” he said.

“We want to share how we did it,” said Annie. She held up the list from the Civil War.

“This tells you how to help wounded people,” she said. She held up the letter from the Revolutionary War.

“And this tells you that even when things look their worst, you shouldn’t give up,” she said.

Jack held up the slate from the pioneer schoolhouse.

“This says, ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,’” he said. Then Jack held up the piece of wood from the San Francisco earthquake.

“And this says that when you’ve lost everything, you can still have hope,” he said.

The man studied the four special writings. Then he looked at Jack and Annie with piercing gray eyes.

“You were both very kind to find all these things and bring them to me,” he said. “Are you magic?”

“Oh no,” said Annie. “Morgan is magic. We’re just ordinary kids.”

The man smiled. He seemed less sad and weary now.

“And I am just an ordinary king,” he said softly. “I suppose if two ordinary kids can find courage and hope, then an ordinary king can find it, too.”

The man slowly stood up.

“I will go now and speak to my knights,” he said. “I will share the wisdom you have brought me.”

He wrapped his cape around him. He bowed to Jack and Annie.

“Thank you,” he said. Then he strode bravely out of Morgan’s library.

“Yes, thank you,” said Morgan, walking over to Jack and Annie.

“You’re welcome,” they said.

“These are for your library,” said Jack. He and Annie gave Morgan the four special writings.

Morgan smiled.

“Their wisdom will help many readers who come here,” she said.

“Great,” said Annie.

“It’s time for you to go home now,” said Morgan.

Jack looked around Morgan’s library. He hated to leave. It was the most wonderful room he’d ever seen.

“Don’t worry. You can come back,” said Morgan, reading his mind. “You must come back, for you both have helped save Camelot. Good-bye for now.”

Before Jack or Annie could speak, there was another blinding flash.

Then they were home again, in the tree house, in Frog Creek, in the early morning.



10. The Mystery of Morgan’s Library

“I can’t believe we took a trip to Morgan’s library,” said Annie.

Jack smiled and nodded.

“It was incredible, wasn’t it?” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

A strong breeze gusted through the tree house window. It blew open their research book about San Francisco. Annie reached for the book.

“Jack!” she said. “Look at this!”

She pointed to a photograph in the research book. It showed a boy and a girl covered with dirt. The boy held a sign. It was the poem about hope.

Annie read the caption aloud:

After the earthquake, while fires raged through the city, two brave children tried to give hope to others.





Annie laughed.

“Those brave children are us!” she said. “That’s the picture Fred took of us before we left San Francisco!”

Jack laughed and shook his head with amazement.

Annie closed the book.

“I guess we are two brave kids who try to give hope,” she said. “We just gave some to King Arthur, didn’t we?”

“King Arthur?” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie. She started down the rope ladder. “That was the mystery of Morgan’s library. We had to give four special writings to King Arthur so he could get his hope and courage back and save Camelot.”

“That wasn’t King Arthur,” said Jack. He threw on his pack and followed Annie.

“Sure it was,” said Annie, stepping onto the ground. “Didn’t you hear him say, ‘I’m just an ordinary king’? Get it? King.”

“But King Arthur’s not an ordinary king,” said Jack.

“Well, he thinks so,” said Annie. “I know it was him. I feel it.”

She smiled. Then she started through the Frog Creek woods.

Jack stared after her.

King Arthur!

As birdsong filled the early-morning woods, Jack thought about their visit to Morgan’s library. He remembered the sad king and how their writings seemed to give him strength.

Maybe Annie was right. Maybe they really had helped King Arthur save Camelot. And maybe someday they would go back.

“Hurry, Jack!” Annie called. “Before Mom and Dad wake up!”

“Coming!” Jack shouted. And he took off after her, running for home, finally.





FACTS ABOUT EARTHQUAKES


An earthquake is caused by a sudden shifting of the rocky plates that make up the earth’s surface. When the plates pull apart, push together, or slide past one another, the movement causes shock waves. The place where the plates of the earth meet is called a fault. One of these faults, the San Andreas Fault, runs almost all the way through California.


Every year, millions of earthquakes occur around the world where plates come together, but most are too small to be felt.


The study of earthquakes is called seismology. A person who studies earthquakes is called a seismologist. Seismographs are instruments that detect the motion of earthquake waves.


Since the big earthquake in 1906, Californians have become better prepared for earthquakes:


• New buildings are built to strict building codes that make them more earthquake-proof.

• Fire and police departments and emergency services are better able to handle earthquake problems.

• Citizens are better educated about how to protect themselves from earthquake hazards. Many households have prepared earthquake survival kits and keep emergency supplies on hand.


In a Magic Tree House book, true facts are often worked into the story. Some of the true facts about the 1906 San Francisco earthquake in this book are:


• A banker named Charles Crocker saved his bank’s money by sending wagonloads of money down to the bay.

• A private library called the Sutro Library contained up to 200,000 books. The books were destroyed after they were moved from the Montgomery Building to Mechanics’ Pavilion, which burned down.

• The words on the sign that Peter and Andrew lent to Jack and Annie were written on a sign tacked to a crumbling building on Market Street.

Jack and Annie sat on their porch. Lightning bugs blinked in the warm summer twilight.

“Wow, a shooting star!” said Annie, pointing at the sky.

Jack looked up, just in time to see a streak of light flash through the sky. The light hovered above the Frog Creek woods. Then it disappeared into the treetops.

Jack caught his breath. He turned to Annie.

“That was no shooting star,” he said.

“Right,” she said.

They jumped up. Jack grabbed his backpack from inside the front hall.

“Dad, Mom! Can we go out?” he called. “We’ll be back soon!”

“Ten minutes, no more!” their mom said.

“Okay!” said Jack. He closed the door. “Let’s go! Hurry!”

He and Annie ran across their yard. They ran down their street. They ran into the woods. They ran until they came to the tallest oak. They looked up.

“Yep,” said Annie.

Jack just smiled. He was too happy for words.

“That’s our shooting star,” said Annie. “The magic tree house.”

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

When they climbed inside the tree house, they both gasped. A beautiful woman with long white hair stood in the shadowy corner.

“Hello, Jack and Annie,” said Morgan le Fay.

“Morgan!” Jack and Annie cried.

They threw their arms around her.

“Why are you here?” said Annie. “What do you want us to do for you?”

“You have already done many good things for me,” said Morgan, “and for King Arthur and Camelot. Now I want you to do something good for yourselves. You are going to learn magic.”

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “Are we going to become magicians? Will you teach us charms and spells?”

Morgan laughed. “There is magic that does not need charms or spells,” she said. “You’ll find a special magic on each of your next four adventures.”

“How?” asked Jack.

“A secret rhyme will guide you on each journey,” Morgan said. “Here this is the first.” She held up a slip of paper.

Annie took the paper from Morgan and read the rhyme aloud:

To find a special magic,

You must step into the light

And without wand, spell, or charm,

Turn daytime into night.



“Turn daytime into night?” said Jack. “How can we do that?”

Morgan smiled.

“That’s what you have to find out,” she said.

Jack had lots of questions. But before he could ask any of them, a flash lit up the tree house. He closed his eyes against the light. When he opened them, Morgan le Fay was gone. On the floor where she had stood was a book.

“Morgan didn’t tell us enough,” said Jack.

“But she left this research book,” said Annie. She picked up the book. “And it’ll tell us the first place to go.” She held the book up to the gray light at the window.

The cover showed a busy river with boats and a bridge. The title was

Merry Olde England



“What’s o-l-d-e mean?” asked Annie.

“I think that’s the old way of spelling old,” said Jack. “You say it the same.”

“So we’re going to merry olde England to find magic?” said Annie. “That sounds fun. Ready?”

“I guess,” said Jack. He still wished they’d gotten more information from Morgan. But he pointed at the cover of their research book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,

I wrote this book because I’ve always loved the theater. When I was growing up, I performed in many plays. I even married an actor and playwright! My husband, Will, and I both love plays by Shakespeare. So for the past two summers, we’ve enjoyed visiting friends in England who put on plays by Shakespeare on the grounds of a castle. We also like to visit the replica of Shakespeare’s Globe Theater in London.

My main research for Stage Fright on a Summer Night, though, comes from my memories of being onstage. Imagine waiting in the wings, heart pounding, palms sweating, knees shaking … Then you’re on!

It’s one of the most frightening and fun experiences you can think of. So I hope you’ll be a little frightened and have a lot of fun when you share this adventure with Jack and Annie.

All my best,

For James Simmons




One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there. While they are gone, no time at all passes in Frog Creek.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian of Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie help free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solve four ancient riddles and become Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie have to save four ancient stories from being lost forever. In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie free a mysterious little dog from a magic spell. In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie help save Camelot. In Magic Tree House Books #25–28, Jack and Annie search for special kinds of magic.




1. Special Magic





Jack and Annie sat on their porch. Lightning bugs blinked in the warm summer twilight.

“Wow, a shooting star!” said Annie, pointing at the sky.

Jack looked up, just in time to see a streak of light flash through the sky. The light hovered above the Frog Creek woods. Then it disappeared into the treetops.

Jack caught his breath. He turned to Annie.

“That was no shooting star,” he said.

“Right,” she said.

They jumped up. Jack grabbed his backpack from inside the front hall.

“Dad, Mom! Can we go out?” he called. “We’ll be back soon!”

“Ten minutes, no more!” their mom said.

“Okay!” said Jack. He closed the door. “Let’s go! Hurry!”

He and Annie ran across their yard. They ran down their street. They ran into the woods. They ran until they came to the tallest oak. They looked up.

“Yep,” said Annie.

Jack just smiled. He was too happy for words.

“That’s our shooting star,” said Annie. “The magic tree house.”

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

When they climbed inside the tree house, they both gasped. A beautiful woman with long white hair stood in the shadowy corner.

“Hello, Jack and Annie,” said Morgan le Fay.

“Morgan!” Jack and Annie cried.

They threw their arms around her.

“Why are you here?” said Annie. “What do you want us to do for you?”

“You have already done many good things for me,” said Morgan, “and for King Arthur and Camelot. Now I want you to do something good for yourselves. You are going to learn magic.”

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “Are we going to become magicians? Will you teach us charms and spells?”

Morgan laughed. “There is magic that does not need charms or spells,” she said. “You’ll find a special magic on each of your next four adventures.”

“How?” asked Jack.

“A secret rhyme will guide you on each journey,” Morgan said. “Here this is the first.” She held up a slip of paper.

Annie took the paper from Morgan and read the rhyme aloud:

To find a special magic,

You must step into the light

And without wand, spell, or charm,

Turn daytime into night.



“Turn daytime into night?” said Jack. “How can we do that?”

Morgan smiled.

“That’s what you have to find out,” she said.

Jack had lots of questions. But before he could ask any of them, a flash lit up the tree house. He closed his eyes against the light. When he opened them, Morgan le Fay was gone. On the floor where she had stood was a book.

“Morgan didn’t tell us enough,” said Jack.

“But she left this research book,” said Annie. She picked up the book. “And it’ll tell us the first place to go.” She held the book up to the gray light at the window.

The cover showed a busy river with boats and a bridge. The title was

“What’s o-l-d-e mean?” asked Annie.

“I think that’s the old way of spelling old,” said Jack. “You say it the same.”

“I guess,” said Jack. He still wished they’d gotten more information from Morgan. But he pointed at the cover of their research book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. London Bridge


Warm daylight flooded into the tree house. Jack opened his eyes.

Annie was wearing a long dress with an apron. Jack was wearing a shirt with puffy sleeves, knee-length pants, and tights. Their shoes were leather slippers. Jack’s backpack was now a leather bag.

“These clothes are weird,” said Jack. His voice was nearly drowned out by the sound of thundering wagon wheels coming from below.

“What’s going on?” said Annie.

She and Jack looked out.

The tree house had landed in a patch of trees near a wide brown river. Wagons, carts, and people were heading toward the river.



Ferryboats, sailing ships, and white swans glided across the water.

“Wow, it’s so busy,” said Annie.

Jack opened their research book and read:

In 1600, over 100,000 people lived in London, England. At that time, England was ruled by Queen Elizabeth the First. She was much loved by her people.



“A queen? Cool,” said Annie.



Jack took out his notebook and wrote:



“I’ve never seen a bridge like that,” said Annie, looking to the left.

Jack looked with her. A giant stone bridge crossed the river. The bridge looked like a small town. It was crowded with houses, shops, and even a church.

Jack found a picture of the bridge in their research book. He read aloud:

At the heart of London was London Bridge. The bridge crossed the Thames (say TEMZ) River. At different times in history, the bridge fell down. But it was always built again.



“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “That must be where the song comes from.” She sang, “London Bridge is falling down, falling down … .”

While Annie sang, Jack took out his notebook and wrote:



“Let’s go look for the magic,” said Annie. She read Morgan’s note again:

To find a special magic,

You must step into the light

And without wand, spell, or charm,

Turn daytime into night.



Jack squinted up at the sky. It was very blue, without even a cloud.

“It’s just not possible,” he said, shaking his head.

But he threw the research book and his notebook into his leather bag. Then he followed Annie down the rope ladder. When they reached the ground, they started walking toward the river.

“P-U!” Annie said, holding her nose.

The river smelled terrible.

No one else seemed to mind the smell, though. People were cheerfully piling into ferryboats or heading for the bridge. They all seemed happy, as if they were going someplace fun.

A group of ragged boys brushed past Jack and Annie. They were about twelve or thirteen years old. They were laughing and out of breath.

“Hurry! We’ll be late!” one shouted.

The boys ran toward the stone gateway leading onto the bridge.

“Late for what?” said Annie. “What’s on the other side of that bridge? Why are they in such a hurry to get there?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He pulled out their research book. “I’ll see what the book says.”

“No, let’s just go—or we’ll be late!” said Annie. She took off running.

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He put away the book and ran after her toward London Bridge.

3. The Bear Garden

Jack and Annie passed under the stone gateway that led onto London Bridge.

As they started across, Jack was amazed. The bridge was so noisy and smelly! Wagon wheels rumbled like thunder over the cobblestones. Pots clinked in carts. Horses neighed. Shopkeepers shouted.

“Good pies!”

“Hot peas!”

“New pins!”



“Shoes! Soap! Salt!”

A shopkeeper caught Jack’s eye. “What lack you, boy?” he shouted.

“Nothing, thank you,” said Jack, and kept walking.

“Watch out!” a cart driver yelled.

Jack grabbed Annie’s hand. He pulled her out of the way. The cart rolled past them over the narrow roadway.

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed to a bear in a wooden cage in the back of the cart. The bear had matted brown fur. His head was down.

As the cart rumbled on, Jack shook his head. “What next?” he said.

“Them,” said Annie, looking up.

She pointed at huge black birds sitting hunched at the edges of the rooftops. The birds sat still as they stared down at all the carts and animals and people crossing London Bridge. Jack shivered and moved quickly past the gaze of the giant silent birds.

Finally he and Annie came to the end of the bridge. They stepped onto the riverbank. There they stopped and looked around.

“I wonder where those big kids went,” said Annie.

Jack studied the crowd heading down the road that led from. the bridge. There was no sign of the group of ragged boys.

Jack took out their research book. He found the picture of London Bridge. He read aloud:

London Bridge connected London to the south bank of the river, an area where Londoners went for entertainment. The Bear Garden was a popular spot.



“The Bear Garden?” said Annie. “That sounds good. Where’s that?”

Jack found a map of the south bank. He pointed to a circle that was labeled BEAR GARDEN.

“Here,” he said. He looked up. “And … there!” He pointed to a dark, round building in the distance.

“Great!” said Annie. “I want to see the garden filled with bears.”

“Let’s read—” started Jack.

“Let’s look!” said Annie. She headed toward the Bear Garden.

Jack put away their book and followed her. As they got closer, they heard loud shouting and laughter coming from inside the round building.

Annie stopped.

“Wait,” she said. “I’m getting a bad feeling about the Bear Garden. Maybe we should read more about it.”

Jack opened their book again. He read aloud:

At an arena called the Bear Garden, people watched bears fight with dogs. Animal fights were a common sport in old England. They are against the law today.



“Bears fight with dogs? Yuck!” said Annie. “I couldn’t stand to watch that!”

“Me neither,” said Jack. “Forget that place.” He started to walk away.

“Hey, Jack! Look over there!” said Annie. She pointed to a cart nearby. “That’s the bear that passed us on the bridge!”

4. A Midsummer Night’s Dream

Annie and Jack ran over to the cart. In the back of it was a cage. In the cage was a big brown bear.

The bear was slumped over, his head still down. The sign on the cart said DAN THE DANCING BEAR.

“Dan?” Annie asked. “Are you going to fight?”

The lonely-looking bear raised his huge head and looked at Annie. His dark eyes were sad. He let out a low moan.

“I understand,” Annie said. “You don’t want to fight. You’re asking me to take you away.” Annie reached for the door of the bear’s cage.



“Away with you!” someone shouted angrily. “That’s my bear!”

Jack and Annie whirled around. The cart driver was charging toward them.

“He’s mine! I’m selling him!” the man shouted.

“Come on, Annie. Let’s go,” said Jack. He pulled her into the crowd walking down the road.

“But I have to save Dan!” said Annie, looking over her shoulder. “That guy wants to sell him to the bear fights!”

“I know,” said Jack. “But we can’t just steal him. That guy is his owner.”

Jack looked around. He needed to get Annie’s mind off the bear. He saw the group of older kids from the bridge. They were walking toward a round white building.

“Hey, look, the kids from the bridge!” he said. “Let’s see where they’re going.”

“What about Dan?” said Annie.

“We can figure that out later,” said Jack. “Let’s follow those kids now.”

He steered Annie toward the white building. When they got closer, Jack read the sign out front:

A PLAY AT THE GLOBE THEATER!

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM



Great! thought Jack. Annie loved plays. She loved acting in them at school.

A man stood at the door of the theater. He was holding a box.

“A penny to stand! A penny to stand!” he shouted.

The older kids dropped coins into the box and went inside.

“Wow, the play costs only a penny!” said Jack. “That’s cheap!”

“But we don’t have any pennies,” said Annie. “Besides, I want to go back and free the bear.”

Jack sighed.

“What will you do with him if you free him, Annie?” he asked.

“I’ll figure something out,” she said.

“Well, figure it out when the owner’s not standing there,” Jack said. “Right now, let’s learn something about this play.”

He quickly pulled out their research book. He found a picture of the Globe Theater. He wanted Annie to forget about the bear, so he read with lots of feeling:

The first theaters were built in old England. Because there was no electricity, plays were performed during the day, when it was light. Almost everyone could afford to go.



“Neat, huh?” said Jack.

Annie sighed.

Jack kept reading in a loud, dramatic voice:

Seating for the audience depended on how much was paid. The people who could afford the higher prices sat in galleries above the stage. Others stood in an area below the—



“Boy!” someone shouted.

Jack looked up.

A man hurried over to Jack and Annie. He was long-legged, with a trim beard and twinkly eyes.

“I could hear you from across the way,” the man said. “You read very well!”

Jack smiled shyly.

“No, you are simply brilliant!” the man said. “And I am in great need of a boy who is a brilliant reader!”

5. Stage Fright

“Why do you need a boy who’s a brilliant reader?” Annie asked the man.

“Because I have just lost two fairies!” he said. He pointed at Jack. “You can read both!”

And you are nuts, thought Jack. “Well, bye, see you around,” he said. He nudged Annie to move along.

“Wait, wait,” she said. She turned to the man. “What do you mean, my brother can read both fairies? Read them where?”

“Two boy actors didn’t show up today to play fairies,” said the man. “But your brother reads with such expression! He can save us all!”

Jack stared. Was this guy saying what he thought he was saying?

“You mean you want Jack to be in your play?” said Annie.

“Indeed!” said the man. “There are three thousand people here today, waiting to see the play I have written! We cannot disappoint them, can we?”

“Three thousand?” said Jack.

“Yes!” said the man. “And one of them is the most important person in the world!”

“No. No way. I can’t do that,” said Jack. He had never liked being onstage. He always got stage fright.

“Wait, wait, Jack,” said Annie. She turned to the man. “You need two fairies, right?”

“Yes,” said the man.

“Well … ” Annie tilted her head. Her voice went up. “I can read, too.”

“Yes! Let Annie do it,” said Jack. “She’s a great reader. She can be both fairies!”

“Ah, but of course Annie cannot go onstage,” the man said kindly.

“Why not?” asked Annie.

The man raised his eyebrows. “Surely you know it’s against the law for girls to go on the stage,” he said. “Boys must play all the girls’ parts.”

“But that’s not fair!” said Annie.

“Indeed, ’tis not. But we cannot change the law now,” said the man. He turned to Jack. “So, Jack? Will you join our players?”

“No thanks,” said Jack. He tried to walk off, but Annie grabbed his arm.

“Wait, I think I know what Jack wants,” she said to the man. “He will only be in your play if I can be in it, too.”

“No, that’s not what I want, Annie,” Jack said under his breath.

“But, Jack, it would be so much fun,” she whispered. “And there’s nothing to be afraid of. You get to read your part. You don’t have to memorize it.”

Jack could tell that Annie really, really wanted to be in the play. And it was definitely a way to keep her mind off the bear.

“Uh, okay,” he said, sighing. He looked at the man. “I’ll be in your play—if Annie can be in it, too.”

The man looked at Annie. She smiled eagerly at him.

The man smiled back.

“Why not?” he said. “But Annie will have to pretend to be a boy. She can tuck up her hair, and we’ll call her Andy.”

“Yay, thanks!” said Annie with a grin.

A trumpet blasted inside the theater.

“Hark, the play begins!” the man said. He took Jack and Annie by the hand.

“My name is Will, by the way,” he said. “Come along, Jack and Andy! Be as swift as shadows!”

6. Onstage!

Will led Jack and Annie through a door into the back of the Globe Theater. Then he led them up a dark stairway.

As they headed upstairs, Jack heard laughter coming from the audience. His legs felt like jelly.

“This way,” said Will.

He led Jack and Annie into a crowded, dimly lit room. Actors were rushing about everywhere. Each seemed to be in his own world. One was pulling on a cape. Another was tying a rope around his waist. A third was whispering words to himself.

“I’ll find your costumes,” said Will.

As Will dug through a large basket of clothes, Jack and Annie looked around the costume room. It was crammed with fancy gowns, purple and blue capes, gold and silver wigs, stacks of hats, and masks.

“Cool,” whispered Annie. She touched a donkey mask and a lion mask. “These would make good disguises, huh?”

Jack was amazed she was acting so calm. Didn’t she know they were about to stand in front of three thousand people? The thought made him break into a sweat. His stomach felt fluttery.

“Here!” said Will. He handed them green tunics, hats, and slippers. “Put these on! No time to dally! Your parts come up soon!”



Jack and Annie slipped behind a curtain and changed into their costumes. As they put on their hats, Annie hid her pigtails.

When they came out, Will handed them each a small scroll. “Here are your rolls,” he said. “They have only your lines on them, no one else’s.”

Jack unrolled his scroll. He had two long speeches to read.

“Wait a second,” he said. “I thought I just had a few lines. I didn’t know I had a ton.”

“Don’t worry,” said Will. “Just remember—speak very clearly and with feeling. And above all, act natural.”

Act natural? thought Jack. How do you act natural when you’re about to have a heart attack?

Just then a short, chubby man burst into the costume room. He had curly hair and bright red cheeks. He was dressed all in green, too.

“For goodness’ sakes, Will!” he said in a frantic whisper. “What will we do?”

“Don’t worry! Look who I’ve found! They both can read!” said Will. He pushed Jack and Annie forward. “Jack and Andy, meet Puck, ‘merry wanderer of the night.’ He’ll take you to the stage. Good luck!”

Annie smiled. Jack groaned.

“Come, boys!” said Puck. “Follow me!”

Puck led Jack and Annie out of the costume room into the hallway. Then he guided them to a dark area at the back of the stage.

Actors stood silently nearby, waiting to go on. One wore a beautiful white gown. Others wore tattered brown rags.

Through an arch, Jack saw the roof of the stage. It was blue with stars and a moon. A huge crowd stood directly in front of the stage. More people watched from the galleries above.

Every single person in England is out there! Jack thought with horror. How did I let Annie talk me into this?

“I’ll take you onstage first,” Puck whispered to Jack. “When I say, ‘How now, spirit! Whither wander you?’, start reading your lines. Understand?”

Jack barely nodded. His mouth felt dry. He tried to swallow, but he couldn’t.

Puck turned to Annie.

“You go onstage with the fairy queen,” he whispered. He pointed to the actor dressed in the beautiful white gown. “When she tells you to sing her to sleep, you start your song.”

“What’s the tune?” asked Annie.

“Just make it up,” said Puck. “Now, if they yell rude things, do not stop. Just—”

“If who yells rude things?” Jack broke in.

“The groundlings get a bit wild,” said Puck.

“Groundlings?” said Jack.

“The rowdy folk who don’t have seats,” said Puck. “They’re standing close to the stage. If they throw rotten fruit, don’t stop, either. Just keep going.”

That does it, thought Jack. He couldn’t go onstage—not with groundlings throwing things, not with three thousand people watching, not with a million lines to read—and not when he was about to throw up!

While Puck and Annie watched the show, Jack slipped away. He looked for the exit. Just as he found the stairs, he bumped into Will.

“Where are you going?” Will whispered.

“I can’t stay,” said Jack. “I’m sick!”

Will sucked in his breath. But then he put his hands on Jack’s shoulders and spoke calmly.

“Close your eyes for a moment, Jack,” he said.

Jack closed his eyes. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears.

“There is nothing to fear,” Will whispered. “Imagine you are a fairy. You’re in the forest, on a summer night. See the silver moon overhead? Hear the owls? Hooo-hooo.”

Will’s deep whisper seemed to cast a spell over Jack. He felt calmer. He could picture the silver moon. He could hear the hooting of the owls.

“Are you in the forest, on a summer night?” asked Will.

Jack nodded.

“If you believe that, the audience will believe it, too,” whispered Will.

“We’re on!” whispered Puck. The chubby actor ran to Jack. He grabbed his hand and pulled him along.

Before he knew it, Jack was onstage!

7. In the Forest, in the Night

Jack stood onstage in the bright sunlight. He felt three thousand pairs of eyes staring at him.

“How now, spirit!” Puck said in a loud voice. “Whither wander you?”

Jack looked down at his scroll. He pushed his glasses into place. He opened his mouth. No sound came out.

One of the groundlings hissed.



“How now, spirit!” Puck shouted even louder this time. “Whither wander you?”

Jack closed his eyes. He felt the summer night. He took a deep breath. He cleared his throat. He looked at his speech.

Then he began to read:

Over hill, over dale,

Through bush, through briar,

Over park, over pale,

Through flood, through fire,

I do wander everywhere,

Swifter than the moon’s sphere;

And I serve the Fairy Queen … .



As Jack read, the audience grew quiet. Jack forgot he was Jack. He was in the forest, in the night, talking to Puck.

When he finished, not a single groundling hissed or threw things.

Jack took a deep breath as Puck started his lines. Jack knew he had one more speech. His heart pounded. But it was more from excitement now than fear.

When it was time to start his second speech, he was ready. This time, he spoke very clearly and with feeling. He tried to be as natural as possible. When he finished his speech, the audience clapped and clapped.

Jack hardly remembered leaving the stage. Will was waiting for him.

“Hurrah!” said Will, slapping Jack on the back. “You were brilliant!”

Jack blushed as he gave Will his scroll back. He couldn’t believe he’d just performed, acted, in front of all those people! And he’d actually had fun—just like Annie had said.

Jack waited in the shadows for Annie to do her part. He watched her go onstage with the fairy queen and the other fairies.

When the queen asked the fairies to sing her to sleep, Annie stepped forward. Reading from her scroll, she sang out clearly—and with lots of feeling:

You spotted snakes, with double tongue,

Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;



Annie waved her hand as if shooing away the snakes and hedgehogs.

Newts and blind worms, do no wrong;

Come not near our Fairy Queen … .



Annie shook her finger at the newts and blind worms. The audience howled with laughter.

Annie kept singing. She made funny movements and silly faces to go with the words. She even added a little dance to her song.



By the time she finished, the audience clapped and cheered and stamped their feet.

“Wonderful, job, Andy!” Will said when Annie left the stage.

“You were brilliant!” Jack told her.

“Thanks!” said Annie. She gave her scroll back to Will. “Do I go on again?”

“Not until the end, when we all bow,” said Will.

Just then Jack heard the audience laughing again. He really wanted to see the play. So he found a shadowy spot at the back of the theater and watched from there.

Jack couldn’t understand everything people said, but he could understand the story. It was about people in love. But none were able to marry the people they loved.

The funniest part was about the fairy king and fairy queen. The king was mad at the queen. So he put magic juice on her eyelids to make her fall in love with the first person she saw.

Puck worked for the king. He wanted to make the king’s trick even funnier. So he put the head of a donkey on a funny man. When the queen woke up, she saw the donkey-man. The magic made her fall madly in love with him!

The fairy king finally broke the spell. Puck turned the donkey-man back into a human while he slept. When the man woke up, he looked about in wonder.

“I have had a most rare vision,” he said. “I have had a dream … .”

Jack whispered the words to himself. “I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream.”

Beside him, a group of actors gathered for the last scene of the play.

“My lion mask is missing!” one of them wailed. “I cannot be a lion without my mask!”

“Hush, of course you can,” said Will. “Just roar! And roar again!”

Will pushed the actor onstage. He wiped his brow. Then he caught sight of Jack.

“Get Andy!” he said. “It’s almost time for our bow.”

Annie? Where is Annie? Jack wondered. He hadn’t seen her in a while. He peeked into the costume room. She wasn’t there.

Jack’s heart started to pound. He had a scary thought … .

“Oh, no,” he whispered.

Jack ran down the stairs. He opened the door. He was happy to see Annie running out from some trees behind the theater.

“It’s time to bow!” he said, grabbing her hand. “Where have you been? What did you do?”

“I’ll show you later!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie charged upstairs together. They found Will and some of the actors waiting.

Puck was finishing his last speech onstage:

So good night unto you all.

Give me your hands if we be friends … .



“Andy! Jack!” said Will. He grabbed Annie and Jack.

Puck ended his speech. The audience gave a big hand. They clapped and whistled and shouted.

Jack and Annie ran onstage with Will and the other actors. While the crowd cheered, they all bowed once … twice … and once again.

8. The Most Important Person

Will stepped forward and held up his hands. Slowly the crowd quieted down.

“Thank you all,” he said. “And thank you to the most important person in all the world. She has graced us with her presence today.”

Will made a sweeping bow to a woman in a gallery above the stage. The woman wore a white dress with pearls. A veil covered her face.

The woman stood up and slowly lifted the veil. She had pale, wrinkled skin and small dark eyes. She wore a red wig.

The audience members let out a gasp. They all fell to their knees.

“Long live Queen Elizabeth!” said Will.

“Long live Queen Elizabeth!” the crowd shouted.



“Long live Queen Elizabeth!” shouted Jack and Annie.

The queen smiled. Her teeth were all black! The audience didn’t seem to mind. They cheered even louder.

The queen raised one hand and the crowd instantly hushed.

“I thank you, my good people,” she said. “And I thank all these good players, every one. Today, they gave us a special kind of magic—the magic of theater. They turned the very daytime into night.”

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. That was it—the special magic. Their search was over.

The audience cheered again. When the actors left the stage, they gathered around Will to congratulate him on his success.

Annie pulled Jack aside.

“We found it!” she said. “The magic!”

“I know!” Jack said. “Will helped us. Let’s thank him!”

“Later,” said Annie. “First I have to show you something. I need your help! Quick!”

Annie led Jack downstairs and outside. As people streamed away from the Globe, the late afternoon sun was going down.

“This way,” said Annie. She headed for the patch of trees behind the theater.

When she and Jack stepped into the gloomy shade, Jack saw an odd figure near a tree. A purple cape barely covered his furry back. A golden wig and a lion mask barely hid his furry head.

Jack gasped. “The bear! You stole him!”

“I had to,” said Annie. “I went to the cart when no one was looking. I put a costume on him. So if we passed people on the way here, they’d think he was an actor.”

“But you can’t just steal him!” said Jack.

“I wasn’t stealing. I was saving,” said Annie. “I’m not sure what to do with him now. What do you think?”

Just then the bear’s owner charged into the woods. “Where’s my bear?” he shouted. His face was red. He was scowling.

“Thieves!” he yelled. “Give him back! I’m selling him to the fights!”

“NO!” said Annie, standing between the bear and the man. “He’s a tame bear! Not a fighter!”

“She’s right!” said Jack, jumping in. “And besides, bear fighting is stupid! Really stupid!”

“ ’Tis, indeed,” said a deep voice.

Jack, Annie, and the bear’s owner whirled around. Will and Puck were standing at the edge of the woods.

9. Sweet Sorrow

“Tut, tut, you’re a sorry sight, man,” Will said to the bear’s owner. “Trying to sell an old tame bear to the fights. Well, I’ve been planning to write a play with a part for a bear. So take this money for him and be gone.”

Will handed some gold coins to the bear’s owner.

The man’s eyes grew wide. He laughed.

“You can have him!” the man said. And he took off.

“Thank you, and good riddance!” called Will. Then he turned to Puck. “Take our new player to the stables. Tell the actors they needn’t be afraid of him. He’s tamer than most of them.”

“Come this way,” Puck said. He put his arm around the bear and gently led him out from the trees. “You’ll love the stage, old man.”

“Bye, Puck! Bye, Dan!” said Annie.

Puck smiled and waved. The bear stared for a moment at Jack and Annie. He had a grateful look in his eyes. Then he lumbered off with Puck.

“Thanks, Will, for helping Dan,” said Annie. “And for helping us.”

“Thank you both for helping me,” said Will. “You saved the day.”

“The night, you mean,” said Jack.

“Indeed, the night,” said Will. “Oh, here is your bag. You forgot it.” He gave Jack his leather bag. Then he held up their two scrolls with their lines on them.

“And you can take these,” said Will. He handed them to Jack, and Jack put them in his bag.

“Where are you off to now?” said Will.

“The other side of London Bridge,” said Annie.

“Ah, I can take you there in my boat,” said Will. “Follow me.”

Will led them along a dusty path toward the river. The last rays of the sun slanted through the trees. Soon they came to a small rowboat docked on the Thames.

“Climb in,” said Will.

Jack, Annie, and Will climbed in. Will untied the boat from the dock. Then he began rowing across the river.

The water reflected the purple and pink in the sky. Only a few white swans now glided over the shimmering ripples. The river smelled as bad as before, but Jack didn’t mind now. He had grown used to it.

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil.

“What are you doing?” Will asked.

“I wanted to write some of my memories in my notebook,” said Jack.

“Ah, and I’ll note you both in my book of memory,” said Will.

Jack smiled.

“I have a question, Will,” said Annie. “Why does Queen Elizabeth have black teeth?”

“Too much sugar,” said Will.

“I hope it doesn’t make her feel bad—looking that way, I mean,” said Annie.

“Oh, no, she’s not the least hurt,” said Will. “The queen has no idea how she looks. She hasn’t peeked in a good mirror for twenty years.”

“Is that true?” said Annie.

“ ’Tis,” said Will. “The queen pretends to be young and beautiful. Just as you pretended to be a boy, and the bear pretended to be an actor. You see, all the world’s a stage.”

Jack liked that idea. He wrote in his notebook:



Jack looked up at London Bridge as they passed by. The shops on the bridge were closed now. The theater crowd was thinning out.

The scary black birds were no longer on the rooftops. They had swooped down and were picking at the garbage left on the cobblestones.

The show was over.

By the time they came to the riverbank, night was falling. It was much cooler. Will tied up his rowboat and climbed ashore with Jack and Annie.



“Thanks a lot,” Jack said to Will. “We can go the rest of the way by ourselves.”

“Where do you live?” said Will.

“In Frog Creek,” said Annie.

“What path do you take?” asked Will.

“You’ll never believe this,” said Annie. “We climb up the rope ladder to a tree house in that tree over there. And we open a book—”

“Then we make a wish,” said Jack, “and we go to the place in the book.”

Will smiled.

“Thy life’s a miracle, isn’t it?” he said.

“Yes!” said Annie. Jack nodded. He liked the way Will looked at things.

“I have an idea,” said Will. “Why don’t you both stay here instead? You can live and act at the Globe Theater. I’ll ask the queen to exclude you from the law about girls going onstage, Annie—because of your great talent. And I will teach you both to write plays.”

“Really?” said Jack and Annie together.

Jack couldn’t imagine anything more fun. Then he thought of his parents back in Frog Creek.

“But our mom and dad—” he said.

“We would really miss them,” said Annie.

Will smiled.

“I understand,” he said. “And I would miss you if I were them.” He put his hand over his heart. “So, good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow.”

“Yes, ’tis,” said Annie, nodding.

“Farewell!” said Will. He waved.

Jack and Annie waved back. Then Will turned on his heels and headed back to his rowboat.

Jack and Annie walked to the rope ladder and climbed up to the tree house. When they got inside, they looked out the window.

Will was rowing back across the Thames River. A single white swan glided across the ripples beside his boat. A silver moon was rising in the sky.

At that moment, Jack did feel sweet sorrow. He wanted to stay in merry olde England just a little longer.

“Wait, Will!” he shouted.

But Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book.

“I wish we could go home,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. Our Will?


Jack opened his eyes.

They were wearing their own clothes again. A lightning bug blinked inside the growing darkness of the tree house.

Annie picked up Morgan’s note. She repeated the rhyme:

To find a special magic,

You must step into the light

And without wand, spell, or charm,

Turn daytime into night.



“We found the special magic,” said Annie. “Theater magic!”

“Yep,” said Jack.

He opened his backpack. He and Annie took out the two scrolls Will had given them. When they unrolled them, Jack saw that Will had written something. He read aloud:



“William Shakespeare?” said Annie. “I’ve heard that name before.”

“Me too,” said Jack.

He took out their research book. He looked up Shakespeare in the index. He turned to a page and read aloud:

William Shakespeare lived from 1564 to 1616. He wrote thirty-seven plays and many sonnets and other poems. Many people think he was the greatest writer who ever lived.



“The greatest?” said Annie. “Our Will?”

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. He stared in amazement at William Shakespeare’s autograph.

“Hey, we can leave our scrolls with Morgan’s note,” said Annie. “It’ll prove to her we found a special magic.”

They put their two scrolls next to the note on the floor. Then they climbed down the rope ladder.

When they started walking through the woods, a breeze blew, shaking the tree leaves. Shadows shifted. Birds called from hidden places.

“Remember the enchanted woods?” Annie said in a hushed voice. “The fairy queen and the fairy king?”

Jack smiled and nodded.

“And Puck, the merry wanderer of the night?” said Annie. “And Will, our Will.”

Jack nodded again.

“I had a great time,” said Annie. “Didn’t you?”

Jack sighed.

“Yes,” he said. Then he took a deep breath and spoke very clearly and with feeling:

“I have had a most rare vision.

I have had a dream … .”

MORE FACTS FOR JACK AND ANNIE AND YOU!


William Shakespeare did write a play that included a small part for a bear. That play is called The Winter’s Tale.


Queen Elizabeth’s teeth were black from eating too much sugar (as were the teeth of many other people from that time). One of the queen’s ladies-in-waiting wrote that the queen was not given a clear mirror to look at herself for the last twenty years of her life.


There is no historical evidence that Queen Elizabeth I ever visited the Globe Theater. It is believed, though, that she liked Shakespeare’s plays very much and that A Midsummer Night’s Dream was performed at her palace for her and her court.


Today, the place where theaters sell tickets is called a “box office.” That’s because in Shakespeare’s time, people dropped their admission money into a box held at the door.


The reason actors’ parts are now called “roles” is because in Shakespeare’s time, actors were given scrolls, or rolls of paper, with only their own lines written on them.


For over 400 years, people have been quoting lines written by Shakespeare. Some of the lines quoted in this book are:


“I’ll note you in my book of memory.”—from Henry the Sixth


“All the world’s a stage.”—from As You Like It


“Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow.”—from Romeo and Juliet


“Thy life’s a miracle.”—from King Lear


“I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was.”—from A Midsummer Night’s Dream


It is believed that William Shakespeare invented over 2,000 words and expressions, many of which we still use. Some of Shakespeare’s words in this story are:

blushing hush

bump lonely

downstairs long-legged

excitement shooting star

for goodness’ sakes sorry sight

forward swift as a shadow

gloomy tut, tut

good riddance upstairs

howled

Tap-tap-tap.

Jack sat up in bed. Rain tapped against his window. His clock said 5 A.M. It was still dark outside.

Annie peeked into his room.

“Are you awake?” she whispered.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“Ready to find some special magic?” she asked.

“Maybe we should wait,” said Jack. “It’s so dark and rainy.”

“No waiting,” said Annie. “I’ll get an umbrella. You bring a flashlight. Meet you downstairs.”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He jumped out of bed. He pulled on his clothes and put on a jacket. Then he grabbed his backpack and flashlight.

Jack slipped downstairs and out the front door. Annie stood on the porch in jeans and a T-shirt. The air was chilly and breezy.

“Don’t you need a sweater or something?” said Jack.

“I’m okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Annie raised the umbrella. Jack turned on the flashlight. They followed a circle of rainy light down their street into the woods.

They headed through the Frog Creek woods. The flashlight lit up the trees—the wet leaves and dark branches. Then it shined on a dangling rope ladder.

Jack raised the flashlight beam.

“There it is,” he said.

A circle of light lit the magic tree house.

“Morgan’s not there,” said Annie. “I can tell.”

“Maybe she left us a message,” said Jack.

Jack grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie put the umbrella down and followed. When they climbed inside, Jack shined the flashlight around the tree house.

Morgan le Fay wasn’t there. But the scrolls from their trip to old England were.

“Here’s proof we found a special magic yesterday,” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling. “Theater magic.” He had great memories of acting in a play by their friend William Shakespeare.

“Did Morgan leave us a new secret rhyme?” asked Jack.

He shined the flashlight on a book lying under the window. A piece of paper was sticking out of the book.

“Yes!” said Annie. She picked up the book and pulled out the paper.

Jack shined his light on the paper while Annie read aloud:





Dear Annie and Jack,



Good luck on your second journey to find a special magic. This secret rhyme will guide you:





To find a special kind of magic

in worlds so far apart,

speak a special language,

talk with your hands and heart.





Thank you,

Morgan





“What kind of language does she mean?” Jack asked.

“I guess we’ll find out,” said Annie. “Where are we going?”

Jack shined the flashlight on the cover of the book. It showed huge trees partly hidden by mist. The title was:

AN AFRICAN RAIN FOREST

“Rain forest?” said Jack. “Good thing we brought our umbrella and flashlight. Remember the rain in the Amazon rain forest? Remember how dark it was under the treetops?”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “Remember the spiders and scary ants?”

“Well … ,” Jack said, “not all rain forests have the same bugs.”

“Remember the river snakes?” said Annie. “And the crocodiles?”

“Well … ,” said Jack, “not all rain forests have big rivers. There are different kinds of rain forests, you know.”

“Right,” said Annie. She pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there.”

The wind started to blow.

“Oh, remember the jaguar?” said Annie. “And the vampire bats?”

“Wait!” said Jack.

But it was too late. The wind was blowing harder. The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,





Last year, while my husband Will and I were doing research for our Magic Tree House Research Guide on rain forests, we visited the Bronx Zoo in New York. As we passed by the gorilla area, we saw a large gorilla sitting under a tree. She was staring very intently at us. We said hi to her—and she stuck out her tongue at us! I’m convinced she was just trying to make us laugh. And we did! In fact, we still laugh whenever we think about that moment.

We found out later that the gorilla’s name is Pattycake. I keep a photograph of Pattycake on my desk, and I feel as if she’s a giant, friendly spirit who overlooks all my work.

I love gorillas more than I can say. And I hope that by the time you finish reading Good Morning, Gorillas, you’ll love them as much as I do.





All my best,

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there. While they are gone, no time at all passes in Frog Creek.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian of Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5–8, Jack and Annie help free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9–12, they solve four ancient riddles and become Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13–16, Jack and Annie have to save four ancient stories from being lost forever. In Magic Tree House Books #17–20, Jack and Annie free a mysterious little dog from a magic spell. In Magic Tree House Books #21–24, Jack and Annie help save Camelot. In Magic Tree House Books #25–28, Jack and Annie learn about different kinds of magic.

1. Dark and Rainy

Tap-tap-tap.

Jack sat up in bed. Rain tapped against his window. His clock said 5 A.M. It was still dark outside.

Annie peeked into his room.

“Are you awake?” she whispered.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“Ready to find some special magic?” she asked.

“Maybe we should wait,” said Jack. “It’s so dark and rainy.”

“No waiting,” said Annie. “I’ll get an umbrella. You bring a flashlight. Meet you downstairs.”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He jumped out of bed. He pulled on his clothes and put on a jacket. Then he grabbed his backpack and flashlight.

Jack slipped downstairs and out the front door. Annie stood on the porch in jeans and a T-shirt. The air was chilly and breezy.

“Don’t you need a sweater or something?” said Jack.

“I’m okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Annie raised the umbrella. Jack turned on the flashlight. They followed a circle of rainy light down their street into the woods.

They headed through the Frog Creek woods. The flashlight lit up the trees—the wet leaves and dark branches. Then it shined on a dangling rope ladder.

Jack raised the flashlight beam.

“There it is,” he said.

A circle of light lit the magic tree house.

“Morgan’s not there,” said Annie. “I can tell.”

“Maybe she left us a message,” said Jack.

Jack grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie put the umbrella down and followed. When they climbed inside, Jack shined the flashlight around the tree house.

Morgan le Fay wasn’t there. But the scrolls from their trip to old England were.

“Here’s proof we found a special magic yesterday,” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling. “Theater magic.” He had great memories of acting in a play by their friend William Shakespeare.

“Did Morgan leave us a new secret rhyme?” asked Jack.

He shined the flashlight on a book lying under the window. A piece of paper was sticking out of the book.

“Yes!” said Annie. She picked up the book and pulled out the paper.

Jack shined his light on the paper while Annie read aloud:





Dear Annie and Jack,



Good luck on your second journey to find a special magic. This secret rhyme will guide you:





To find a special kind of magic

in worlds so far apart,

speak a special language,

talk with your hands and heart.





Thank you,

Morgan





“What kind of language does she mean?” Jack asked.

“I guess we’ll find out,” said Annie. “Where are we going?”

Jack shined the flashlight on the cover of the book. It showed huge trees partly hidden by mist. The title was:

AN AFRICAN RAIN FOREST

“Rain forest?” said Jack. “Good thing we brought our umbrella and flashlight. Remember the rain in the Amazon rain forest? Remember how dark it was under the treetops?”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “Remember the spiders and scary ants?”

“Well … ,” Jack said, “not all rain forests have the same bugs.”

“Remember the river snakes?” said Annie. “And the crocodiles?”

“Well … ,” said Jack, “not all rain forests have big rivers. There are different kinds of rain forests, you know.”

“Right,” said Annie. She pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there.”

The wind started to blow.

“Oh, remember the jaguar?” said Annie. “And the vampire bats?”

“Wait!” said Jack.

But it was too late. The wind was blowing harder. The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. Cloud Forest

Jack opened his eyes.

“I can’t tell what kind of rain forest this is,” said Annie. She stared out the window.

Jack looked out, too. It seemed to be daytime, but he couldn’t see much of anything. The quiet forest was covered with fog.



Jack opened their research book and read:

The misty rain forest in the mountains of central Africa is called a “cloud forest.”



“Oh, I get it,” said Annie. “We’re up so high, it’s like we’re in a cloud.”

“Cool,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:





Then he read more:

The African cloud forest is home to many animals, including elephants, water buffaloes, black leopards …



Jack looked up.

“Black leopards?” he said.

“Don’t worry,” said Annie.

Jack cleared his throat and kept reading:

… antelopes, wild hogs, and gorillas.



“Gorillas?” said Annie.

“Don’t worry,” said Jack.

“I’m not worried. I love gorillas,” said Annie. “They’re totally great!”

“I don’t know about that,” said Jack. He pictured huge apes pounding their chests. “I’d like to study them, though. Write down their habits and behavior, just like a real scientist.”

“Whatever,” said Annie. “Let’s just go. This’ll be a fun adventure!” She took off down the ladder.

Jack threw his notebook, the research book, and the flashlight into his pack. He hooked the umbrella over his arm. Then he followed Annie.

When they stepped onto the ground, Jack could see better. The fog had turned into a fine mist.

Jack and Annie started through the cloud forest. They walked around huge trees draped with moss. They pushed past tall shrubs and leafy plants.

“Wow, look at that tree,” said Annie.

She pointed to a fat tree. It had wide lower limbs padded with thick cushions of moss.

“It looks like a piece of furniture,” said Annie, “like an armchair.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “I better draw it.”

He put the umbrella on the ground. He pulled the flashlight out of his pack and put it next to the umbrella. Then he took out his notebook and pencil.

As Annie walked ahead, Jack started to draw a simple picture of the fat tree.

“Hey, Jack,” Annie called in a whispery voice. “Come here. Quick!”

Jack grabbed his pack. He moved around the tree and caught up with Annie.

“Listen,” she said.

Jack heard branches snap.

Crack!

A leopard? he wondered.

Crack! Crack!

Jack nervously looked around the forest.

“Maybe we should go back up to the tree house,” he said. “We could read a little more and learn a little more.”

Annie didn’t answer. Jack turned to her. She was grinning from ear to ear as she stared into the bushes. Jack followed her gaze.

A dark, shaggy little head was peeking out from a cluster of leaves.

“Bu, bu?” a small gorilla asked.

OceanofPDF.com



3. Bu-bu

The gorilla’s fur was very black against the green leaves. She had large nostrils and small ears. Her bright brown eyes were full of mischief.

“Bu, bu, bu,” she said. “Bu, bu.”

“Bu, bu yourself,” said Annie.

The gorilla hid behind the leaves again. Then she poked her head out.

“Peekaboo!” said Annie.

The gorilla clapped her hands together. She stuck out her tongue.



Jack and Annie both laughed.

“Bu, bu, bu!” the gorilla said. Then she bounded away through the misty forest.

“Hey, Bu-bu! Don’t leave us!” Annie called.

Jack rolled his eyes. “Don’t name her Bu-bu,” he said to Annie. “You don’t have to—”

“Wait, Bu-bu!” Annie shouted. She took off after the small gorilla.

“—turn every animal into your best friend,” Jack finished. He shook his head. Then he made a list in his notebook.





As he wrote, Jack heard Annie laughing. But then he heard high shrieks.

He caught his breath. A leopard? he wondered.

Carrying his notebook, Jack hurried in the direction of the noise. He found Annie and the small gorilla perched in two trees.

“What’s wrong?” said Jack, standing beneath the trees.

“Nothing!” called Annie. “We’re just playing.”

The small gorilla screeched again. Then she scratched her head and hiccuped.

Annie screeched, too. She scratched her head and hiccuped.

While they played, Jack studied the gorilla a bit more.

He noticed she was about the size of a three-year-old kid. Her fingers looked like human fingers. They even had fingernails! He made a new list:





Jack heard the tree leaves shaking. He looked up. Annie and the gorilla had both climbed higher.

“Hey, come down, Annie!” Jack called. “You might fall. Plus, it’s getting dark.”

Jack looked around. Light was fading quickly from the forest. Is night falling? he wondered. Or is a storm coming?

The small gorilla screeched again and climbed even higher.

“Hey, Bu-bu! Where you going?” said Annie. She climbed even higher, too.

“That’s enough, Annie. Come down now!” said Jack. “I’m serious.”

To his relief, the gorilla settled on a branch. Annie did the same.

The gorilla broke off a piece of tree bark. She nibbled it like a candy bar.

Annie broke off a piece of bark. She nibbled it like a candy bar, too.

The gorilla threw down her bark. She grabbed a tree branch and swung to another tree.

“Don’t try it, Annie!” shouted Jack.

But his warning came too late.

Annie threw down her bark. She grabbed a tree branch and tried to swing to another tree.

Annie didn’t swing like a gorilla. She fell from the tree—and crashed down to the ground near Jack.

“Annie!” he cried.

4. Nightmare


Jack knelt beside Annie. She was gasping for breath.

The gorilla bounded down the tree and over to Annie. She bit her lower lip as if she were worried.

“Are you okay?” Jack asked Annie.

“Yes—” Annie panted, “just—got the breath—knocked out of me—”

“Wiggle your arms and your legs,” said Jack.

Annie wiggled her arms and her legs.

“Good, nothing’s broken,” said Jack.

Just then, he felt a drop of water hit his arm. The mist had turned to rain.

“Uh-oh,” said Jack. He threw his notebook into his pack.

“I better get our umbrella and flashlight,” he said. “I left them near that tree that looked like a chair.”

“I’ll come, too,” said Annie. She started to sit up.

“No, no, catch your breath,” said Jack. “It’s not far. I’ll be right back.”

He took off his jacket and draped it over her. “This’ll help you stay dry,” he said. He pulled on his pack and stood up.

The gorilla screeched.

“Stay with Annie!” said Jack.

Then he dashed back through the cloud forest. He looked for the fat tree with the wide limbs padded with moss.

As he peered through the growing darkness, Jack saw many fat trees. He saw many limbs padded with moss.

Soon he could hardly see trees at all. He realized that both a storm and night had come to the forest.

Forget the umbrella and flashlight, he thought. It was more important to get back to Annie before it was too dark. They could wait together for daylight.

As Jack started back to Annie, he could hardly see. He didn’t know which way to go.

“Annie! Bu-bu!” he shouted. He felt silly shouting, “Bu-bu.” But he didn’t know what else to call the small gorilla.

Jack put out his hands. He moved slowly through the dark, rainy forest. He kept calling for Annie and Bu-bu. He listened for them. But he couldn’t hear anything above the loud patter of the rain.

“Ahh!” he shouted. He had run into something that felt like a ball of spiderwebs!

As he jumped back, he slipped and fell in the mud. He crawled over to a tree and huddled between two of its giant roots.

I’ll just wait here until morning, he thought. Then I’ll find Annie. Or she’ll find me.

As rain dripped all around him, Jack wondered if leopards came out at night. He quickly pushed the thought away. He tried to think about morning and finding Annie and going home.

He was really ready to go home.

Why did Morgan even send us to the cloud forest? he wondered. He tried to remember the secret rhyme.

“To find a special magic … ,” he whispered. He couldn’t remember the rest. He felt tired and miserable. He took his backpack off and rested his head on it. He closed his eyes.

“To find a special magic … ,” he mumbled.

But he couldn’t find the magic. He couldn’t even find the words that finished the rhyme. Worst of all, he couldn’t find Annie.

Their fun adventure in the cloud forest had turned into a nightmare.

5. Silverback

Jack felt something tugging on his sleeve. He opened his eyes.

Bu-bu. The small gorilla was staring at him in the dawn light.

Jack stood up. His arms and legs felt stiff and achy. His wet clothes stuck to his skin.

He looked around the cloud forest. Misty sunlight shined through the tree branches.

“Where’s Annie?” he asked the small gorilla.

Bu-bu waved her arms. Then she bounded off between the trees. Jack pulled on his pack and followed.

As the small gorilla led him through the cloud forest, her head bobbed above the leafy plants. Finally, she stopped before a row of shrubs.

Jack took a few steps forward and peered over the shrubs.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

Large dark figures were sleeping in an open, grassy area—gorillas! There were at least ten of them. Some slept on their backs. Some slept on their bellies.

The gorillas were all sizes. The smallest was a baby sleeping in its mother’s arms. The biggest was a giant with black and silver fur.

Jack pulled the book out of his pack. He found a chapter on gorillas and read:

Mountain gorillas live together in families. The leader of the family is a large male called a “silverback” because he has silver fur on his back and shoulders. Gorillas do not hunt other animals. They mainly eat the plant growth of the forest. They are known to be shy and gentle giants.



“Shy and gentle giants,” Jack repeated. That sounded good.

He peered over the shrubs again. Bu-bu waved at him. She was standing at the far edge of the clearing. She pointed to something in the tall grass.

Annie was fast asleep in the grass!

Jack didn’t know what to do. If he called her name, the gorillas would wake up. He had only one choice. He had to sneak over to her.

Jack put his book in his pack. He pushed past the shrubs and stepped into the clearing. His heart was pounding. He thought of the words from the book—shy and gentle giants.

As he started toward Annie, he heard a grunt. The giant gorilla with silver fur opened his eyes. When the gorilla saw Jack, he sat up.

Jack stopped in his tracks.

The gorilla just glared. This giant did not seem shy or gentle at all.

Jack saw a stick lying on the ground. He picked it up—just in case.

Jack’s stick made the gorilla growl. He stood up. He was very tall and very wide.

Jack dropped his stick.

Bu-bu ran and hid behind a tree.



The silverback growled again. His long, shaggy arms touched the ground. His fingers curled under. Walking on his knuckles, he stepped toward Jack.

Jack stepped back.

The gorilla stepped forward.

Jack stepped back again.

The gorilla kept stepping forward. Jack kept stepping back until he had stepped out of the clearing.

But the silverback kept coming. Jack stumbled back through the brush until he came to a thick wall of plants.

The gorilla kept coming. Jack couldn’t move back anymore.

“Uh … hi,” he said nervously. He held up his hand. “I come in—”

Before Jack could say “peace,” the giant gorilla went crazy. He hooted and leaped to his feet.

Jack crouched down in a panic.

The gorilla kept hooting. He grabbed a tree limb. He shook it wildly. He ripped leaves from branches.

He gnashed his teeth. He cupped his hands. He beat his chest.

WRAAGH! he roared. WRAAGH!

The gorilla dropped on all fours. He charged back and forth past Jack. Then he threw himself on his belly. He began bashing the ground with his palms. He bashed and bashed and bashed.

Jack scrambled on his hands and knees over to a tree. He hid behind the trunk, hugging his head.

He waited for the maniac gorilla to find him and tear him to pieces.

6. Good Morning, Gorillas


The pounding ended. There was silence … a long silence.

Jack opened his eyes. He peeked around the tree. The silverback was sitting on the ground. His lips were curved in a smile. He looked pleased with himself.

Was his whole act a fake? Jack wondered.

Jack didn’t know whether to be scared or to laugh. The only thing he did know was he still had to get to Annie!

Jack pulled out the research book. He found the gorilla chapter again. He read:

To safely get close to gorillas in the wild, it’s wise to act like a gorilla yourself. Crouch down and rest on your knuckles like a gorilla. Keep your head down and act friendly!



Jack packed up his research book. He put his pack on his back. Then he went down on his knees.

Jack took a deep breath. He smiled a friendly smile. Pressing down on his knuckles, he moved out from behind the tree. His fingers hurt as he walked on them.

The silverback grunted.

Jack didn’t look up. He kept smiling a friendly smile as he crawled through the brush toward the clearing.

When he got to the edge of the clearing, he glanced back. The giant gorilla was following him. He was frowning, but he didn’t seem about to attack.

Jack kept going. He moved into the clearing. Then he stopped.

More gorillas were waking up. A large gorilla hugged Bu-bu as if to comfort her.

When Bu-bu saw Jack, she screeched joyfully.

All the other gorillas turned to look at him. They made nervous sounds.

Jack’s heart pounded. But he just smiled his friendly smile and kept crawling. He crawled around the gorillas and over to Annie.

“Wake up!” he said, shaking her.

Annie yawned, then opened her eyes.

“Oh, hi!” she said.

“Are you okay?” asked Jack.

“Sure,” she said. She sat up and looked around. She gasped.

The gorillas were staring at Jack and Annie with bright, darting eyes. The silverback stared the hardest.

“Oh, wow!” said Annie. A joyful smile crossed her face. “Good morning, gorillas!”

7. Eating Out

Annie kept smiling at the gorillas. “Wow!” she said. “Wow, wow, wow.”

“Didn’t you know you were sleeping next to them?” Jack asked.

“No!” she said. “When you didn’t come back, Bu-bu led me here. But I couldn’t see anything. It was too dark.”

Just then, Bu-bu left her mother’s arms and bounded over to Annie. She climbed into Annie’s lap and hugged her.

Another small gorilla left his mother and ran over to Annie, too. He was about the size of a two-year-old kid.

“Ho, ho!” he said. He gave Annie a playful poke.

“Ho, ho yourself!” said Annie. “Is Ho-ho your name?”

She tickled Ho-ho. She tickled Bu-bu, too. The two small gorillas made laughing sounds and fell onto their backs.

The two mother gorillas laughed, too. Huh-huh-huh, they said.

Jack felt a little jealous. He wanted the gorillas to like him as well. But he didn’t know how to join in the fun. So he just sighed and pulled out his notebook. He added to his “gorilla behavior” list:





Suddenly, he heard a low growl.

He looked up. The silverback had moved closer to him. He was glaring.

“That big guy doesn’t understand what you’re doing!” Annie called to Jack. “He’s never seen anyone take notes before.”

Jack quickly put his notebook away.

The giant gorilla huffed. Then he turned to his family and gave a short bark.

The gorillas began lining up behind the silverback. The baby traveled in his mother’s arms. Ho-ho traveled on his mother’s back. Bu-bu and Annie held hands. They all followed the silverback out of the clearing.

“Come on!” Annie called to Jack. “Let’s go with Big Guy and the gang!”

Jack shook his head.

“I don’t think they want me to come along,” he said.

Bu-bu screeched at Jack. She held out her free hand to him.

“Bu-bu wants you!” said Annie.

Jack smiled shyly. He took Bu-bu’s small, warm hand. Then he walked with Annie and the gorillas out of the clearing.

On their ramble through the cloud forest, the gorillas found food everywhere. They munched flowers and ferns and leaves. They swallowed and burped.

They munched twigs and branches and pieces of bark and bamboo. They swallowed and burped.

As the gorillas ate breakfast, it started to rain again. But they didn’t seem to mind.

Annie didn’t seem to mind, either. She and Bu-bu played tag in the drizzly woods. They ran around the trees, laughing and screeching.

Jack tried to follow them, but he gave up. He was tired and cold. Shivering, he stood under a mossy tree to keep dry.

While he was alone, Jack sneaked his notebook out of his pack. He made a new list:





As he wrote, he heard a low growl. He looked up.

Big Guy had spotted him. The silverback was standing close by. He was frowning at Jack, his lips tucked in a tight line.

“Sorry, sorry!” said Jack. He quickly put away his notebook.

Big Guy kept frowning.

Jack quickly tried to act like a gorilla. He went down on all fours. He tore off the leaf of a plant. He took a bite. It tasted bitter, like vinegar. Jack pretended to munch and swallow and burp.

Big Guy huffed, then moved on. As soon as he was gone, Jack spat out the leaf.

“Yuck, yuck, yuck!” he said, wiping his tongue.

Jack felt a tap on his back. He jumped. But it was just Ho-ho. The small gorilla offered him a twig to eat.

“Oh, no thanks, Ho-ho,” said Jack.

Ho-ho kept holding out the twig.

“Oh, okay,” said Jack, politely taking it. “I’ll eat it later.” He put the twig into his backpack.

Ho-ho’s mom came over to Jack. She held some berries to his lips.

“Uh, no thanks,” Jack said.

The gorilla stared at him with a sad look.

“Oh, okay,” said Jack. He opened his mouth. And Ho-ho’s mom fed him the berries.



Jack munched the berries. To his surprise, they tasted good. He swallowed, then burped just like a gorilla. This time, he wasn’t pretending.

Bu-bu’s mom then came over to Jack. She offered him some rainwater from a cupped plant. Jack was very thirsty. He sipped the water. It tasted fresh and cold.

Bu-bu’s mom took Jack’s hand in her wide hand. She led him through the forest to Annie and Bu-bu.

Bu-bu screeched happily when she saw Jack. She threw her furry arms around him.

“Hi! We missed you!” Annie said to Jack. “Are you having fun?”

Jack smiled and nodded.

Actually, he was having fun now. He didn’t mind the rain so much anymore. He didn’t feel so left out. Some of the gorillas really seemed to like him, he thought. They seemed to like him a lot.

8. A Special Language

The rain ended. Slowly the feeding came to a stop.

Big Guy led his family into a clearing. The tall grass sparkled with misty sunlight.

The silverback lay down and tucked his arms under his head.

The other gorillas gathered around him. Some beat the grasses until they were flat.

Ho-ho’s mom made a bed of weed stalks for Ho-ho. Bu-bu’s mom made a bed of leaves for Bu-bu. Then she made two extra beds for Jack and Annie.

They lay down with all the gorillas to take their naps. Jack used his backpack for a pillow.

Lying on his leafy bed, Jack watched the mother of the baby gorilla groom her small baby. The mother parted his hair and searched through it, picking at his skin now and then.

The baby soon wiggled free and crawled around in the grass. His mother’s gaze then rested on Annie. She moved over to Annie and gently grabbed one of her pigtails. She studied it carefully.

“What are you doing?” Annie asked.

“She’s looking for bugs, I think,” said Jack.

“Oh, yuck!” said Annie, sitting up.

Jack laughed. Just then, the baby’s mother reached for him.

“Oops! No thanks! No bugs on me!” he said, and he sat up, too.

The mother gorilla lay back in the grass and closed her eyes. Her baby crawled over to Annie.

“Hi, Little Guy,” Annie said tenderly. She picked up the baby and stroked his head. The baby smiled at her and closed his eyes.

While all the gorillas napped, Jack sneaked the book out of his pack. He found the gorilla chapter. He read softly to Annie:

Gorillas are very smart. A captive gorilla named Koko has even learned sign language. Sign language is a special language used by people who cannot hear. Koko can say—



“What?” Annie said loudly. “Sign language? A special language?”

Her voice woke Bu-bu and Ho-ho. They sat up and rubbed their eyes.

“So?” said Jack.

“Morgan’s secret rhyme!” said Annie. “Don’t you remember?” She repeated the rhyme:

To find a special kind of magic

in worlds so far apart,

speak a special language,

talk with your hands and heart.



“Oh … yeah!” said Jack.

“I even know a little sign language,” said Annie. “In school, we learned how to sign I love you.”

Annie held up a closed hand. Slowly she lifted her thumb, index finger, and little finger. She showed the sign to Bu-bu and Ho-ho.

“I—love—you,” she said slowly.

The small gorillas looked curious.

Jack made the sign, too.

“I—love—you,” he said to Bu-bu and Ho-ho.

The two little gorillas stared at Annie and Jack. Then both of them held up their hands. They tried to make the same sign.



“They love us, too!” said Annie.

“Wow,” said Jack. He glanced over at Big Guy.

The silverback’s eyes were open! He was watching them. Jack quickly closed the book. To his relief, the giant gorilla turned over.

“Well,” Annie said with a sigh, “I guess that does it.”

“We spoke a special language,” said Jack. “We talked with our—” Before he could finish his sentence, Bu-bu pushed him.

“Whoa!” said Jack.

Ho-ho held his little arms above his head. He reared back and charged at Jack. With a flying tackle, he knocked Jack over.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“They want to play with you!” said Annie.

Bu-bu jumped on Jack and put him in a headlock. Jack broke free from the two small gorillas. He jumped up and dashed into the forest.

Bu-bu and Ho-ho charged after him.

Annie carried Little Guy and followed. She laughed as the small gorillas looked for Jack.

Jack hid behind a tree. He pushed his glasses into place. He waited for Bu-bu.

In a moment, she walked by.

“BOO!” Jack shouted, jumping out.

Bu-bu screeched and leaped straight up in the air. Jack cracked up laughing.

Bu-bu didn’t laugh, though. She bit her lip. She hid her face behind her hands.

“Ohhh, Bu-bu,” said Annie. “Don’t be scared.”

She gently put the baby on the ground. She reached out to comfort Bu-bu.

Bu-bu wrapped her arms around Annie’s neck. She buried her furry head in Annie’s shoulder.

“Jack was just playing,” said Annie.

Bu-bu raised her head. She looked at Jack over Annie’s shoulder.

“Friends?” he asked softly.

Bu-bu stuck her tongue out at him.

Jack laughed. Bu-bu showed her teeth in a big smile.

“Friends!” said Jack.

Just then, Ho-ho started screeching. Jack and Annie looked around. Ho-ho was pointing into the bushes.

“Where’s Little Guy?” said Annie. She and Jack dashed around the shrubs.

The baby had crawled to a tree. He was looking up at a branch.

A huge, sleek cat with black fur was sitting on the branch. His pale green eyes stared down at the baby gorilla. He looked hungry.

“A black leopard,” breathed Jack.

The leopard leaped lightly down from his perch. He faced Little Guy. The baby looked scared.

“No!” cried Annie.

She ran over to the baby gorilla and scooped him into her arms.

The leopard let out a snarl. He lowered his head and started slowly toward Annie and the baby.

Jack panicked. He didn’t know what to do at first. Then he remembered Big Guy’s act. Jack took a deep breath. When he let it out, he made a loud hooting sound.

He tore out from the brush. Hooting like a silverback, he ran between Annie and the leopard.

Jack grabbed a tree limb and shook it. He ripped leaves from branches.

He cupped his hands. He beat his chest.

“WRAAGH!” he roared. “WRAAGH!”

Then Jack leaned over and charged back and forth past the leopard.

Finally, he threw himself on his belly. He began bashing the ground with his palms. He bashed and bashed and bashed.



“Jack!” Annie called. “Jack!”

Jack looked up.

“He’s gone,” Annie said in a quiet voice. “The leopard’s gone. He left a while ago.”

“Oh,” said Jack.

He sat up.

He pushed his glasses into place. He looked around. Then he smiled.

9. Good-bye, Gorillas

Jack couldn’t stop smiling. He had scared off a leopard!

Bu-bu and Ho-ho stared at Jack with awe. Annie looked at him with awe, too.

“When did you learn to do that?” she asked.

Before Jack could answer, he heard a rustling in the brush. Then Big Guy stepped out from the shrubs.

The giant gorilla walked silently over to Annie. He took Little Guy from her and put the baby on his back. Then he touched Annie’s cheek gently.

Annie grinned at him.

Bu-bu and Ho-ho ran to Big Guy and clung to his legs.

The giant gorilla barked at the small ones, directing them to come with him.

As he walked past Jack, Big Guy stopped.

Huh-huh-huh, he said in a low voice. He reached out toward Jack.

Jack ducked.

But the silverback patted him on the head. Then he and the small gorillas moved out of sight.

Jack felt as if the top of his head were glowing.

“Wow,” he whispered. “Did you see what he just did?”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “He must have watched the show you put on. He was proud of you.”

“Well, he was proud of you, too,” Jack said modestly.

Annie nodded, smiling. “I guess it’s time to leave now,” she said.

“Leave?” said Jack.

“We have to say good-bye now,” said Annie.

“Good-bye?” said Jack. He didn’t want to say good-bye to the gorillas. He loved them. They were totally great.

“Yeah,” Annie said softly. “Come on.”

She led the way back through the shrubs, around the trees, to the clearing.

They found all the gorillas awake. Some were stretching and yawning. Others were munching on grass or leaves.

The baby was back in his mother’s arms. Bu-bu and Ho-ho were chattering away to their moms.

They’re probably telling them what I did, Jack thought.

He and Annie walked over to Big Guy and stood in front of him. The other gorillas gathered around.

“We have to go now,” Annie said to all of them.

“We have to say good-bye,” said Jack.

“Thanks for letting us be a part of your family,” said Annie.

She and Jack held up their hands and waved. The gorillas looked sad. They murmured soft sounds.

Big Guy lifted his hand in the air as if he were about to wave. But instead, the silverback raised his thumb, his index finger, and his little finger.

I love you, the giant gorilla signed.



Jack couldn’t believe his eyes.

Annie signed back, I love you.

Jack signed, too.

The silverback stared at them for a long moment with a gentle, shy look. Then he turned away and gave a short bark to his family.

All the gorillas lined up behind him. The baby’s mother held her baby close. Ho-ho rode piggyback on his mom. Bu-bu held her mom’s hand.

The silverback started away from the clearing. The others followed.

Bu-bu was the only one who looked back. She screeched and waved at Jack and Annie. Then she walked away, out of sight.

Jack couldn’t talk. His heart was too full. He took a few steps in the direction of the gorillas.

“Hey—” Annie said softly. “You’re going the wrong way.”

Jack looked back at her.

“The tree house is over there,” she said. She pointed in the opposite direction—at the tree house peeking out from the fog.

Jack sighed. Then he turned and started to follow her out of the clearing.

“Oh, don’t forget this,” said Annie.

She leaned over and picked up Jack’s backpack from the grass. She handed it to him.

“Thanks,” he said.

They kept walking.

“And don’t forget this,” said Annie. She picked up Jack’s jacket from under a tree. She handed it to him.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He tied his jacket around his waist. They kept walking.

“And don’t forget these,” said Annie. She pointed to the flashlight and umbrella. They lay on the grass under the wide, mossy limbs of a fat tree.

Annie picked them up and carried them herself.

It started to drizzle again just as she and Jack got to the rope ladder. They climbed up into the tree house.

When they got inside, they looked out the window. Jack hoped to catch one last glimpse of the gorilla family.

But there was nothing to see. A white mist covered the cloud forest.

Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book. She pointed to a picture of Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go home,” she said.

Suddenly, a joyous screech rang out. The happy, wild sound shot through the white mist, through the cool rain, straight into Jack’s heart.

He opened his mouth to answer the call of the gorillas. But it was too late. The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. A Special Magic

Tap-tap-tap.

Jack opened his eyes.

The Frog Creek woods were still dark and rainy.

“We’re home,” Annie said.

Jack sighed.

“I miss them already,” he said.

“Me too,” said Annie. “Did you take a lot of notes on their habits and behavior?”

Jack shrugged.

“I listed a few things about them,” he said. “But sometimes lists don’t tell you much. You have to love gorillas to really know them.”

“Yeah. That’s right,” said Annie.

Jack opened his backpack. He pulled out their research book and put it in the corner.

Then he pulled out the twig that Ho-ho had given him. He smiled as he showed it to Annie.

“I promised Ho-ho I’d eat this later,” he said. “But I think we should save it for Morgan instead.”

“Good idea,” said Annie. “It’ll prove to her that we found a special magic.”

“Yeah, gorilla magic,” said Jack.

“The magic of all animals,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

He placed the twig next to the scrolls they’d brought back from old England.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. She started down.

Jack pulled on his backpack. He put the flashlight in his pack. Then he grabbed the umbrella and followed Annie.

They started through the Frog Creek woods. It was still cool and dark and rainy.

Jack didn’t mind, though. He didn’t put on his jacket. He didn’t take out the flashlight. He didn’t put up the umbrella.

Jack felt as if he weren’t completely human yet. There was still a bit of gorilla left in him.

“Ho, ho, ho,” he said in a low voice.

“Bu, bu,” Annie said back.

“Huh, huh, huh,” they said together.

MORE FACTS FOR

JACK AND ANNIE AND YOU!





Gorillas are the biggest members of the group of animals we call primates. Other primates include chimpanzees, orangutans, gibbons, baboons, monkeys, and humans.

All gorillas live in Africa. There are three groups of gorillas—western lowland gorillas, eastern lowland gorillas, and mountain gorillas. Mountain gorillas are the largest gorillas. They have longer hair and longer jaws and teeth than lowland gorillas.

Mountain gorillas live in the volcanic mountains of Virunga in east-central Africa. The word virunga means “a lonely mountain that reaches to the clouds.”

Gorillas are mainly herbivores, or plant-eaters. They keep on the move, so they will not deplete a feeding area. A silverback gorilla can eat up to 50 pounds of forest vegetation in only one day.



OceanofPDF.com





ENDANGERED SPECIES





All gorillas are on the endangered species list. But the ones most threatened are the mountain gorillas. Fewer than 650 still live in the wild. None live in captivity. A woman named Dian Fossey lived for almost 20 years with the mountain gorillas. During her life, she fought very hard for their protection.



OceanofPDF.com





GORILLAS AND AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE





Since 1971, a lowland gorilla named Koko has been part of a gorilla language project in California. Gorillas will never be able to talk like people because their vocal cords cannot make the necessary range of sounds. But a woman named Penny Patterson taught Koko the gorilla how to use American Sign Language. American Sign Language is a special language using hand gestures. It is primarily used by people who are unable to hear. Koko has learned to make more than 1,000 signs. And she understands about 2,000 English words. She proves that gorillas have extraordinary intelligence, as well as many thoughts and feelings similar to those of humans.

“Come on,” said Annie. She stood in the doorway to Jack’s bedroom. “Let’s check the woods.”

“But it’s Thursday,” said Jack. “We’re going to Grandmother’s soon.”

“I know,” said Annie. “But I have a feeling the tree house might be back. I think Morgan might have sent us a new rhyme.”

Jack trusted Annie’s feelings.

“Okay, but we’ll have to be quick,” he said. He threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. He followed her downstairs.

“Be back soon!” Jack called to their parents.

“Very soon!” their dad said.

“Don’t forget—it’s Thursday,” said their mom. “We’re leaving for Grandmother’s at nine!”

“I know!” said Jack.

“We’ll be back in ten minutes!” said Annie.

They hurried out of their house. They ran across their yard and up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Jack and Annie ran through light and shadow, until they stopped under the tallest oak.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“You were right!” said Jack.

High in the tree was the magic tree house.

Jack grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie was right behind him.

They climbed into the tree house. Sunlight slanted in through the window.

“Good, our gifts from our last trips are still here,” said Annie.

She pointed to the scrolls from Shakespeare’s theater and the twig from the gorillas.

“Proof we found the magic of the theater and the magic of animals,” said Jack.

“Look,” said Annie. She pointed to a book lying in a dark corner. A piece of paper was sticking out of it.

Jack pulled out the paper.

“It’s from Morgan,” he said.

He read:

Dear Jack and Annie,

Good luck on your third journey to find a special magic. This rhyme will guide you:





To find a special magic,

When work and toil are done,

Gather all together,

Turn three worlds into one.





Thank you,

Morgan



“So who do we gather with?” wondered Jack.

Annie held up the book. The painting on the cover showed a basket of corn on a wooden table. The title said A Feast to Remember.

“We gather at a feast,” she said. She pointed to the cover. “I wish we could go there.”

“Hold on,” said Jack. “What kind of feast? Where and when?”

But the wind had started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





Dear Readers,





When I did research for Thanksgiving on Thursday, I learned something I hadn’t known before. I learned that what we generally think of as the first Thanksgiving—the 1621 feast with the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people of Plymouth Bay—was not a day set aside to give thanks. It was a three-day festival to celebrate a good harvest. During that time, the Pilgrims and Wampanoag shared many meals. Even so, we traditionally think of this harvest festival as the first Thanksgiving. More than two hundred years later, in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln designated the last Thursday in November as America’s national day of Thanksgiving.

I love doing the research for Magic Tree House books because I always learn something new. I hope you’ll learn lots of new things, too, when you visit the “first Thanksgiving” with Jack and Annie.





All my best,

For Bill, LuAnn, Mickey, and Alan—

Thanksgiving friends for many years





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there. While they are gone, no time at all passes in Frog Creek.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian of Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

Jack and Annie have many exciting adventures helping Morgan and exploring different times and places. In Magic Tree House Books #25–28, they will learn the art of magic … .



1. What Feast?

“Come on,” said Annie. She stood in the doorway to Jack’s bedroom. “Let’s check the woods.”

“But it’s Thursday,” said Jack. “We’re going to Grandmother’s soon.”

“I know,” said Annie. “But I have a feeling the tree house might be back. I think Morgan might have sent us a new rhyme.”

Jack trusted Annie’s feelings.

“Okay, but we’ll have to be quick,” he said. He threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. He followed her downstairs.

“Be back soon!” Jack called to their parents.

“Very soon!” their dad said.

“Don’t forget—it’s Thursday,” said their mom. “We’re leaving for Grandmother’s at nine!”

“I know!” said Jack.

“We’ll be back in ten minutes!” said Annie.

They hurried out of their house. They ran across their yard and up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Jack and Annie ran through light and shadow, until they stopped under the tallest oak.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“You were right!” said Jack.

High in the tree was the magic tree house.

Jack grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie was right behind him.

They climbed into the tree house. Sunlight slanted in through the window.

“Good, our gifts from our last trips are still here,” said Annie.

She pointed to the scrolls from Shakespeare’s theater and the twig from the gorillas.

“Proof we found the magic of the theater and the magic of animals,” said Jack.

“Look,” said Annie. She pointed to a book lying in a dark corner. A piece of paper was sticking out of it.

Jack pulled out the paper.

“It’s from Morgan,” he said.

He read:

Dear Jack and Annie,

Good luck on your third journey to find a special magic. This rhyme will guide you:





To find a special magic,

When work and toil are done,

Gather all together,

Turn three worlds into one.





Thank you,

Morgan



“So who do we gather with?” wondered Jack.

Annie held up the book. The painting on the cover showed a basket of corn on a wooden table. The title said A Feast to Remember.

“We gather at a feast,” she said. She pointed to the cover. “I wish we could go there.”

“Hold on,” said Jack. “What kind of feast? Where and when?”

But the wind had started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Shh!

Jack opened his eyes. Bright, golden sunlight poured into the tree house. The air felt crisp and cool.

Annie was wearing a long dress, a white cap, and an apron.

Jack wore a jacket with a frilly collar. He wore short pants, long socks, leather shoes, and a hat. His backpack was now a leather bag.

“I like your hat,” said Annie. “It’s funny.”

“Yours, too,” said Jack.

“You look like a Pilgrim,” said Annie.

“So do you,” said Jack. “Oh, man. I bet we’re in the time of the Pilgrims!”

He and Annie scrambled to the window.

The tree house had landed in a tall oak near the edge of a forest. Red and yellow leaves rattled in the cool breeze. Past the forest was a small village and past the village was the ocean.

“It looks like where the Pilgrims lived,” said Jack. “We studied it in school.”

He opened the research book and found a picture of the village by the sea. He read aloud:

In 1620, a group of 102 passengers sailed from England to America on a ship called the Mayflower. Many of the people on board wanted freedom of religion. They wanted to worship God in their own way—not the way the king of England made them. Others wanted to find a new life in a new land. Today, we call all the people who sailed on the Mayflower Pilgrims.



“Yes!” said Annie.



Jack read on:

The Pilgrims wanted to settle near New York. But a storm blew their ship north. They landed in a bay on the coast of what is now Massachusetts. Six years before, Captain John Smith had explored the coast. He had named the bay Plymouth.



“Plymouth?” said Annie. “That’s where the first Thanksgiving was!”

“Oh, man … ” Jack smiled. “So that’s the feast.”

“Wow,” said Annie. “My class put on a play about the first Thanksgiving.”

“Mine, too,” said Jack.

“I played Priscilla,” said Annie.

“I played a turkey,” said Jack.

“Now we’ll get to meet the real Priscilla!” said Annie. “And Squanto! And Governor Bradford and Miles Standish! Come on!”

She started down the ladder.

“Wait. What will we say?” asked Jack.

“We’ll just tell them hi and stuff,” said Annie.

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. He put the book into his bag. “They won’t understand who we are! We need a plan.”

He slung the bag over his shoulder and hurried down the ladder after Annie.

“Listen, we need—” Jack started.

“I know, a plan,” said Annie. “But first let’s get closer to the village and just watch.”

“Okay,” said Jack, “but we can’t let anyone see us. We have to be careful and quiet.”

He and Annie started walking carefully through the woods. But they did not walk quietly. The autumn leaves crunched and crackled under their leather shoes.

“Shh!” said Jack.

“I can’t help it,” said Annie. “You’re doing it, too!”

“Then we have to stop,” said Jack. “Let’s get behind that tree and watch from there.”

They crunched over to a tree at the edge of the woods. In the distance was a row of small log houses with steep thatched roofs.

Jack pulled out the book. He found the part about the village. Then he pushed his glasses up and read to himself:

The Pilgrims brought chickens, geese, goats, and sheep from England. They brought seeds to plant, and they knew how to make traps to catch wild animals for food. But they could not have survived without the help of a Wampanoag (wom-puh-NO-ag) Indian named Squanto. Squanto taught them how to grow corn.



“Hi, you,” Annie whispered. Jack looked up.

Annie was talking to a skinny yellow dog. The dog was sniffing a tree near them.

“Don’t let him see us,” Jack whispered.

“Why?” said Annie.

The dog looked at them and barked.

“That’s why!” said Jack.

The skinny dog barked again and again.

Two Pilgrim men ran from the other side of the houses. Then more Pilgrims appeared. They all looked in the direction of the barking dog.

“Oh, no!” said Jack. “Let’s go back! We don’t have a plan yet!”

He packed up his book and started away from the tree. Suddenly something tightened around his ankle. A tree branch snapped.

“AHHH!” Jack shouted as he was jerked up into the air.



3. Wow?

“Jack!” cried Annie.

The skinny dog barked and jumped around happily.

Jack was hanging a few feet off the ground, with a rope around his ankle. His glasses and hat and bag had fallen to the ground. Jack felt the blood rushing to his head.

“I must have stepped into a hunting trap,” he said in a strangled voice.

“I’ll free you,” Annie said. She tried to reach the rope, but it was too high.

Jack heard voices over the wild barking of the dog. A blur of people gathered around him and Annie.

“Oh, mercy!” a woman cried.

“We have caught a boy!” a man said.

The dog licked Jack’s face.

“Help,” said Jack.

A burly man shooed the dog away, then grabbed Jack. Another cut the rope with a knife. Then they gently lowered Jack to the ground.

Jack sat in the leaves, feeling dizzy. He took the rope off his foot and rubbed his ankle.

“Here,” said Annie, handing Jack his glasses, hat, and bag.

He put them all on and stood up. Now he could see. About forty or fifty Pilgrims—men, women, and lots of children—stared at him and Annie. Some of the children were laughing.

The girls were dressed just like the women. The boys were dressed just like the men.

One person, though, looked different from everyone else in the crowd. His skin was brown. A deer skin hung over his shoulder. His black hair was braided and had a feather in it.



Is that Squanto? Jack wondered. The Wampanoag Indian who helped out the Pilgrims?

Two Pilgrim men stepped forward. One had a smile on his face. The other was frowning.

“Good day!” the friendly-looking man said. “Who art thou?”

“I’m Annie,” said Annie. “This is my brother, Jack. We come in peace.”

“Welcome to Plymouth Colony,” said the man. “I am Governor Bradford. This is Captain Standish.”

Captain Standish kept frowning. He carried a long gun over his shoulder.

“Oh, wow!” said Annie.

“Wow?” said Captain Standish.

“Wow?” whispered others, as if they didn’t understand.

“I’ve just heard a lot about you,” said Annie. She looked around. “Is Priscilla here?”

“Shhh!” whispered Jack.

“I am Priscilla,” said a young woman. She looked about seventeen or eighteen. Her face looked weary, and her eyes were sad.

“Hi,” said Annie shyly. “I was you.”

“Annie,” warned Jack.

“Thou was me?” Priscilla asked. She sounded puzzled.

“Never mind my sister,” said Jack. “She’s nuts.”

“Nuts?” repeated Priscilla.

“Nuts?” whispered others.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack, with a nervous laugh.

“Oh, brother?” repeated Priscilla.

Annie giggled.

“Um. Never mind,” said Jack. “That’s just how we say things at home.”

“And where is thy home?” Captain Standish asked. He didn’t sound as friendly as Governor Bradford or Priscilla.

“Um, we live in a village up north,” said Jack. “Our parents sent us here to, uh”—he remembered something from their research book—“to learn how to grow corn.”

“But how and when did your family come to America?” the captain asked.

Jack was worried. Now that he had started making up a story, he couldn’t back out. Luckily, he remembered something else from their book.

“We sailed to America with Captain John Smith,” he said, “when he was exploring the coast. Annie and I were babies then.”

“Ah, indeed?” said Governor Bradford.

Jack nodded. “Indeed,” he said.

“I believe Squanto knew Captain John Smith when he was in Plymouth,” said Captain Standish. “Perhaps he remembers thee.”

Everyone in the crowd turned to the man with the braid.

Oh, no! thought Jack. He knew Squanto wouldn’t remember them.

“These children say they sailed with Captain John Smith,” Governor Bradford said to Squanto. “Does thou remember two wee babes named Jack and Annie?”

Squanto moved closer to Jack and Annie. He looked carefully at their faces. Jack held his breath. His heart pounded.

Squanto turned to the governor.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “I remember.”



4. We Fish!

Annie grinned. “Good day, Squanto!” she said.

“Good day, Annie,” said Squanto. He smiled at her and Jack.

Jack was too surprised to speak. Why did Squanto say he remembers us? he wondered. Is he mistaking us for two other kids?

Captain Standish looked surprised, too. But Governor Bradford smiled warmly.

“ ’Tis a wonder,” he said. “We welcome all the small folk sent to us. Children are a gift from God—no matter where they come from.”

That’s a nice way of looking at things, Jack thought.

Just then, a boy ran up. “Chief Massasoit is here with ninety men!” he shouted.

The boy pointed to a long line of men walking down a path near a cornfield.

Chief Massasoit walked ahead of the others. His face was painted red. He wore a fur robe and white beads.

Governor Bradford, Captain Standish, and Squanto went to meet the visitors.

“Mercy!” a Pilgrim woman whispered.

All the Pilgrims looked worried.

“Art thou afraid?” Annie asked.

“Oh, no,” said Priscilla. “We invited Chief Massasoit and his men to our harvest feast. But we did not expect so many. We have not prepared enough food.”

Governor Bradford and Squanto spoke to the chief. Then Squanto led a number of men into the woods. And the governor walked back to the Pilgrims.

“The Wampanoag men will hunt more deer,” he said. “But we must also bring more food to the table. Priscilla, please tell the young folk what they must do.”

The grown-ups went back to the village as the Pilgrim kids gathered around Priscilla. She told some to carry water or set up tables. She told others to gather vegetables or hunt small animals.

Once the kids were given their jobs, they rushed off to do them. Finally only Jack, Annie, and a small girl holding a big basket were left.

“Jack, would thou like to go fowling with the boys?” Priscilla asked him. She pointed to a group of boys who had just headed off with the dog.

Jack stared at her in panic. What does she mean? he wondered.

“What’s ‘fowling’?” Annie asked.

“Thou does not know?” said the little girl. “ ’Tis hunting water birds, of course.”

“Jack doesn’t know how to do that,” said Annie.

“ ’Tis true? How does thou eat and live?” the little girl asked curiously.

“We, uh … ” Jack froze.

“We catch—fish!” said Annie.

We do? thought Jack.

“Ah, good!” said Priscilla. “Then I bid thee bring back as many eels and clams as thou can. We have near one hundred fifty mouths to feed.” Priscilla took the basket from the small girl and gave it to Annie.

“We will see thee later!” Priscilla said, waving. “Mary and I must go help with the cooking.”

“Um … ?” said Jack.

But before he could ask any questions, Priscilla and the little girl started back to the village.



5. Eels and Clams

Jack looked at Annie.

“We can’t stay here,” he said.

“What?” she said. “We can’t go home now. The Pilgrims need us to help them.”

“But we don’t know how to do anything!” Jack said. “And Squanto is going to figure out he doesn’t really know us. And—”

“Don’t worry so much,” said Annie. “We help Mom and Dad make our Thanksgiving dinner every year, don’t we? We can help the Pilgrims. But we’d better hurry!”

Clutching the big basket, she started running toward the bay. Jack sighed, then ran after her.

At the rocky shore, they stopped and looked around. Little waves rolled onto the short stretch of sand. The salty air felt clean and fresh. Seagulls swooped over the water.

“I wonder where the eels are?” said Annie. “And the clams?”

“I’ll look in the book,” said Jack.

He pulled out their book and looked up eels in the index. He turned to the right page and read aloud:

Squanto showed the Pilgrims a way to catch eels. He showed them how to push the eels out of the wet sand with their bare feet, then grab them with their hands.



“That sounds fun!” said Annie. She put down her basket and pulled off her shoes and stockings. She held up her long skirt with one hand. Then she walked over the rocks to the edge of the water.

Jack put the research book into his bag. He pulled off his shoes and stockings and joined Annie.

They dug their bare feet into the wet sand.

“I don’t feel anything,” said Jack.

“Let’s wade into the water,” said Annie.

Together they stepped forward.

“Brrr!” said Annie.

“No kidding!” said Jack with a shiver.

He kept squishing the muddy sand with his toes. He felt pebbles and shells. Then he felt something soft.

“Hey, I think I found one,” he said.

Annie splashed over to him. “Where?”

“Stand back,” he said. “Here.”

Jack squished harder with his feet. The soft thing moved! Jack squished more. An eel slithered through the water.

Jack grabbed it with both hands!

“AHH!” he yelled.



The eel was long and skinny like a snake. It felt slimy and icky! It twisted and squirmed. Annie laughed as Jack tried to hold on to it.

The eel wiggled out of Jack’s hands and fell against Annie.

“Yikes!” she yelled, jumping away and bumping into Jack.

With more screams, they both tumbled into the cold water.

They scrambled up and splashed back to shore. Annie was still laughing.

“Poor eel!” she said, trying to catch her breath. “We scared him half to death!”

“Him?” said Jack.

“F-forget eels,” said Annie, her teeth chattering. “What about c-clams?”

Jack was wet and cold. But he took out the book again and looked up clams. He turned to the right page and read aloud:

Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to dig for quahog (KO-hog) clams. Quahog clams are hard-shell clams. They can live for sixty years or more. The oldest have been known to live for almost 100 years. They—



“Oh, forget it,” Annie broke in.

“What?” said Jack.

“We can’t catch them,” she said. “They live to be so old. We can’t just end their lives.”

Jack sighed. He sat down on a rock. Annie sat next to him. Their clothes were soaking wet. Their feet were caked with muddy sand. Their basket was empty.

“What other things do Pilgrim kids do to help?” said Annie.

Jack opened the book again. He looked up Pilgrim children. He read aloud:

Pilgrim children worked very hard. They built fences and cared for animals. They planted, harvested, and ground corn. They picked pumpkins, peas, and beans. They guarded the fields. They fished and hunted. They carried water. They collected nuts. They cooked and cleaned. They did everything they were told. They never complained about being tired.



“Oh, man, I feel tired just reading this,” said Jack, closing the book. “We make lousy Pilgrim children.”

“Yeah, I know,” said Annie. “Maybe we could do something like … like keep an eye on the turkey and tell them when it’s ready. That’s how I help Mom every year.”

“Annie, Thanksgiving in Frog Creek is a whole different story from Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims,” said Jack.

“Annie! Jack!” a voice called.

Jack quickly put away their book. Then they turned around.

Priscilla was standing on a rock. She held a pumpkin and carried a basket filled with yellow squash and red corn.

“I was looking for you,” she said.



6. Good Work

“Good day, Priscilla!” said Annie.

“Good day,” said Priscilla. She walked to them. “Did thou fill the basket with eels and clams?”

“Not really,” said Jack.

“The eel didn’t want to get caught,” said Annie. “And the clams live to be so old! We didn’t think it was right to take their lives.”

Priscilla laughed. Her sad eyes sparkled.

“What strange children,” she said. “But you both look wet and cold. Would you like to come to my house and warm up by the fire?”

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie.

They washed off their feet and pulled on their shoes and stockings. Jack picked up his bag. Annie picked up their empty basket.

“Would thou like to put some of my corn and squash in thy basket?” said Priscilla.

“Oh, thanks!” said Annie. She took some corn and squash from Priscilla’s basket.

“And perhaps thou would like to carry the pumpkin?” Priscilla said to Jack.

“Sure!” said Jack.

“Sure?” said Priscilla.

“I mean, indeed,” said Jack. He felt relieved. Now they wouldn’t have to go back empty-handed.

Jack wrapped his arms around the heavy pumpkin. Annie carried the basket. They followed Priscilla back to the village.

The Pilgrims and Wampanoag were gathering in a wide dirt street. Women were baking bread in an outdoor oven. Some boys were setting wooden planks on barrels to make tables. Mary, the little girl, was carrying a bucket of water.

Squanto sat smoking a pipe with Chief Massasoit, Governor Bradford, and Captain Standish.

Jack hoped Mary wouldn’t ask him about the clams and eels. He hoped Squanto wouldn’t ask him about Captain John Smith. He hoped the governor and the captain wouldn’t ask him about home. Jack hid his face behind the fat pumpkin.

Priscilla opened the door to a small house. Then she led Jack and Annie into a dark, smoky room. The only light came from one window and a fire.

“Sit by the hearth,” said Priscilla, “so your clothes can dry.”

“Where’s the hearth?” Annie asked, looking around.

Priscilla laughed again, shaking her head. “There, where the fire lies,” she said.

Jack put down the pumpkin and his bag. Annie put down her basket. The hearth was so large, Jack could have stood in it. He and Annie got as close as they could to the warm, crackling fire.

Several pots hung over the fire. Near the pots, a turkey was roasting on an iron rod.

“The Thanksgiving turkey,” whispered Annie.

“Cool,” said Jack. The very first Thanksgiving turkey, he thought.

“Would thou please stir the corn pudding whilst thou art drying?” asked Priscilla. She pointed to one of the pots.

“Indeed,” said Jack.

Priscilla took a wooden spoon out of a jug of water near the hearth. She gave it to Jack. He put it into the thick, bubbly pudding and stirred.



“I must gather nuts,” said Priscilla. “Whilst I am gone, move the roots close to the ashes and stir herbs into the seafood chowder.”

“Indeed,” said Annie.

After Priscilla left, Annie looked at Jack.

“What are ‘roots’ and ‘herbs’?” she asked.

“Look in the book,” said Jack.

Annie took the research book from Jack’s bag. She looked up roots and read aloud:

The Pilgrims called certain vegetables roots. These vegetables, such as carrots and turnips, grow under the ground.



“Ah!” said Jack. He picked up some carrots and turnips near the hearth and moved them close to the hot ashes.

Next, Annie looked up herbs. She read aloud:

The Pilgrims called leafy vegetables that grow above the ground herbs. They made salads with herbs. They used dried herbs to flavor soups and seafood chowders.



Jack saw some dried plants hanging from the rafters.

“Those must be the herbs,” he said.

Annie broke off a leaf and sniffed it.

“Mmm, that smells good,” she said. She leaned close to one of the pots. “And that must be the seafood chowder. It smells like the ocean.”

She crumbled the leaf into the chowder. She took another spoon from the jug of water. She and Jack both stirred pots.

“Good work!” Priscilla said as she stepped back into the room.

Jack smiled. The fire had made him hot and sweaty. The smoke burned his eyes. But he didn’t mind. Finally he felt useful.

Priscilla put some walnuts close to the fire.

“Squanto taught us which nuts are good to eat,” she said.

“Squanto taught thee a lot,” said Annie.

“He saved our lives,” Priscilla said quietly. “Last winter we were cold and hungry. Half our people died.”

Annie gasped. “How?” she said.

“Sickness,” said Priscilla. “Fever took my mother, my father, and my brother.” Her eyes were bright with tears.

No one spoke. The sound of the crackling fire filled the room. Then Annie put her arm around Priscilla.

“We’re so sorry,” said Annie.

“Yes, we are,” said Jack.

“Thank you,” Priscilla said with a sad smile. “ ’Twas a terrible winter. But we never gave up hope. And now, God be praised, we have had a good harvest, and we have peace with our neighbors.”

In the glow of the firelight, Priscilla was beautiful, Jack thought. Not only was she kind, but she was incredibly brave as well.

“Come,” she said. She wiped her eyes and stood up. “Something special is about to take place. Would thou like to watch?”

“Sure! I mean, indeed!” said Annie.

She and Jack jumped up and followed Priscilla outside.



7. Arm Exercises

Priscilla led Jack and Annie away from the village toward a large field. The Pilgrims and Wampanoag men had already gathered there.

Jack could hear the beat of a drum. But he couldn’t see what was going on.

“Make haste or we will miss it!” said Priscilla.

“Miss what?” asked Annie.

“Captain Standish is about to lead the men and boys,” said Priscilla. “They will exercise their arms.”

Why do they exercise their arms? Jack wondered. Will they expect me to join in?

As he hurried after Priscilla toward the crowd, Jack practiced. He stretched his arms out wide. He made circles in the air. Then he flapped his arms up and down.

Priscilla caught sight of him.

“What art thou doing, Jack?” she asked.

“Exercising my arms,” he said.



Priscilla smiled. Then she started to laugh. She laughed and laughed.

So did Jack, but he wasn’t sure why.

A loud BANG! came from the field.

Jack jumped. He stopped laughing.

A puff of smoke rose into the air. As the crowd parted, Jack saw the Pilgrim men and boys proudly holding up their long guns.

“What just happened?” said Annie.

“The men fired their muskets,” said Priscilla. “On special occasions they like to show off their arms.”

Oh! thought Jack. Now I get it! The long guns are muskets, which are also called arms. So “exercising arms” means firing muskets!

Jack blushed. Priscilla must think I’m an idiot, he thought.

But she just smiled at him fondly.

“I thank thee for making me laugh, Jack,” she said. “I have not laughed hard in a long time.”

Jack shrugged, as if he had meant to make her laugh.

“It is time now to serve our feast,” said Priscilla. “I must help with the bread.”

“What can we do?” asked Jack.

“Return to my home,” said Priscilla, “take the turkey off the spit, put it on a platter, and bring it to a table.”

“Oh, great, we get to help with the turkey!” said Annie. “I always help with the turkey at home.”

“Good,” said Priscilla. “May thou feel my home is thy home today.”

Jack was excited, too. He and Annie were about to serve the first turkey at the first Thanksgiving! They ran back to the smoky house and rushed inside.

“Where’s the platter?” said Jack, looking around. He saw a flat wooden block. “That must be it.”

Annie picked up the wooden platter. “How do we get the turkey on it?” she asked.

They moved close to the fire and stared at the turkey roasting on the iron rod.

“That must be the spit,” said Jack. The spit sat on iron legs. It had a handle.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “I’ll lift the spit,” he said. “Then we’ll push the turkey onto the platter.”

“Be careful,” said Annie.

Jack reached out and wrapped his fingers around the handle of the iron spit.

“OWW!” he shouted. The handle was super hot! He yanked his hand away and knocked the spit off its legs.

The turkey fell into the fire. The grease from the turkey sputtered and popped. The turkey burst into flame! The fire roared!

“AHH!” yelped Jack and Annie together. They jumped back from the hearth.



Jack grabbed the water pot on the floor. He threw the water into the fire. The fire sizzled and smoke billowed up. When the smoke cleared, the fire was out.

But the turkey was completely black.



8. The Feast

Jack buried his face in his hands.

“I don’t believe it,” he said. “I just burned up the Pilgrims’ turkey!”

“Stay calm,” said Annie. “I’ll get Priscilla.”

“No, don’t tell Priscilla,” moaned Jack.

“We have to tell Priscilla,” said Annie.

She hurried out of the house.

Jack lifted his head and stared at the burned turkey.

“Oh, man,” he whispered unhappily. The Pilgrims had worked so hard to get their food. They had had such a terrible winter—especially Priscilla. And now he had ruined their first Thanksgiving!

The door opened. Annie pulled Priscilla over to the hearth.

“See!” said Annie. “The turkey fell into the fire! It burned up!”

“I did it,” Jack confessed.

Priscilla just stared at the burned turkey in the wet, messy hearth. Then she looked at Jack. He looked away from her.

“Ah, Jack,” Priscilla said softly. “Thou looks sad.”

He nodded.

“I ruined everything,” he mumbled.

“No, thou did not,” said Priscilla. She reached out her hand. “Come.”

Priscilla led Jack and Annie out into the bright autumn light.

“Look,” she said.

Jack saw Pilgrim women and kids walking to the tables. They all carried wooden platters piled with food.

“In the other houses, there was cooking also,” said Priscilla.

Jack saw roasted ducks, turkeys, and deer meat. He saw baked fish, lobsters, eels, clams, and oysters.

He saw pumpkins, beans and corn, dried plums, berries and roasted nuts, steamy pots of soups and puddings, and loaves of baked breads.

“We had a very good harvest this fall,” said Priscilla. “We stored many vegetables. We salted our fish and cured our meat. And today, our Wampanoag neighbors brought back five deer from the forest for our feast.”

Jack was relieved to see all the food.

Priscilla knelt down and looked him in the eye.

“See, thou did not ruin anything, Jack,” she said. “Thou and Annie have helped me a lot this day. You have both made me laugh. And you have both acted with kind hearts.”

Jack was amazed. He thought he’d been no help at all.

“Come,” said Priscilla. “Let us join the others. Art thou hungry?”

Jack nodded. Seeing all the platters of food had made him really hungry.

He and Annie followed Priscilla.

In the golden glow of autumn light, Jack and Annie joined the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag at the long tables.



Priscilla gave Jack and Annie wooden plates. She gave them big white cloth napkins. Then she served them plenty of food.

Before they started to eat, Governor Bradford stood up to speak.

“Those of us who came here on the Mayflower did not know how to live in this land,” he said. “But Squanto came to help us. And today, we give thanks for him, and for the peace we share with his people, and for all our great blessings.”

Governor Bradford looked at Jack and Annie.

“Welcome to our feast,” he said. “At this moment, three worlds—your world, our world, and the world of the Wampanoag—are not three. They are one. ’Tis the magic of community.”

“Indeed!” said Annie. She clapped her hands and looked at Jack. “We did it,” she whispered.

Did what? thought Jack.

Governor Bradford then put his napkin over his shoulder.

“Now!” he said. “Let us feast till our bellies are filled!”

As everyone started to eat, Annie leaned close to Jack.

“We found the special magic,” she whispered. “The magic of community. Remember the rhyme?” She repeated Morgan’s words:

“To find a special magic,

When work and toil are done,

Gather all together,

Turn three worlds into one.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He’d forgotten all about it.

“We can go home now,” said Annie.

“No way,” said Jack. “We have to eat first.”

Jack and Annie used their fingers to pick up their food. And they ate and ate and ate. Jack tried everything on his plate—except a little bit of eel and two clams. Everything he did eat, he liked—even the turnips.

Food really tastes good, he thought as he chewed, when you eat it outside, on a beautiful day, with lots of nice people.


9. Good Day


Slowly the feast came to an end. The guests wiped their plates with their last bits of bread. Then they wiped their hands and faces with their napkins.

Jack and Annie stood up.

“We have to go home,” Annie said to Priscilla.

“Ah, thou must go back to thine own community now,” said Priscilla.

Annie nodded. Then she kissed Priscilla on the cheek.

“Thanks for everything,” Annie said.

Jack wanted to kiss Priscilla, too, but he was too shy.

“Thanks, Priscilla,” he said.

“I thank thee, Jack,” she said. Then she leaned over and kissed his cheek.

Jack felt his face grow red.

“Excuse me, sir,” Annie said to Governor Bradford. “But we must leave now.”

“Oh, but we have not yet taught thee how to grow corn!” said the little girl Mary.

Squanto stood up.

“Come,” he said. “I will walk Jack and Annie back to the forest. I will teach them.”

“Oh, thou does not have to do that,” Jack said quickly. He feared that once they were alone, Squanto would figure out they’d never met before.

But Squanto only smiled and waited for them to follow.

“Bye, everyone!” said Annie, waving.

Jack waved, too. All the Pilgrims and Wampanoag waved back at them. The skinny dog barked.

Squanto led Jack and Annie away from the village toward the autumn woods. As they passed the cornfield, the dried stalks swayed in the breeze. They made shushing sounds.

Squanto stopped walking. He pointed to the field.

“You must plant corn in the spring,” he said. “Put the seed in the ground when the oak-tree bud is as small as a mouse’s ear.”

“Oh, wait, please,” said Jack. He slipped his notebook and pencil out of his bag. It was the first time he’d had a chance to take notes all day. He wrote:



Then he looked up at Squanto and nodded.

“Dig holes and put two rotting fish in each hole,” said Squanto.

“Rotting fish?” said Annie, making a face.

“Yes, rotting fish is good food for the soil,” said Squanto. “On top of the fish, place four corn seeds. Then cover them with dirt.”

Jack quickly wrote:



“Got it,” he said, looking up.

“I give you these corn seeds to take home,” said Squanto. He held up a small pouch.

“Thanks,” said Annie, taking the pouch.

“Thanks a lot,” said Jack. “Well, good-bye.” Jack was eager to get going—before Squanto could ask them questions about the past.

“Wait, I have a question,” said Annie. “Squanto, why did you say you remembered us?”

Squanto’s dark eyes twinkled. “I did not say I remembered you,” he said. “I only said I remember.”

“What did you remember?” asked Annie.

“I remembered what it was like to be from a different world,” said Squanto. “Long ago, I lived with my people on this shore. But one day, men came in ships. They took me to Europe as a slave. In that new land, I was a stranger. I felt different and afraid. I saw the same fear in your eyes today. So I tried to help you.”

Annie smiled. “We thank thee,” she said.

“And now you must always be kind to those who feel different and afraid,” said Squanto. “Remember what you felt today.”



“Indeed,” said Jack.

Before closing his notebook, he added one last thing:



Squanto bowed.

“Good day, Jack and Annie,” he said.

“Good day!” they said.

Squanto turned and headed back to the village. The sun was setting. All of Plymouth was lit with a fiery light.

“It really was a good day,” said Annie.

“Yeah, it was,” said Jack.

Annie sighed. “Ready to go home?” she asked.

“Indeed,” Jack said.

They started running through the woods. Their feet crunched through the red and yellow leaves. They scrambled up the rope ladder into the tree house.

From the distance came the sounds of the Pilgrims singing a hymn and the Wampanoag beating their drums. Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book. She pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go home!” she said.

“Good-bye, Priscilla!” Jack called.

“Good-bye, Squanto!” said Annie. “Good-bye, everyone!”

The wind started to blow.

The wind blew harder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


10. Thankful


Jack opened his eyes. He sighed. They were wearing their own clothes again. His leather bag was a backpack.

Sunlight slanted through the tree house window. As always, no time at all had passed in Frog Creek.

“Home,” said Annie. She held up the pouch of corn seeds. “Proof for Morgan we found a special magic.”

“The magic of community,” said Jack.

Annie placed the pouch on the floor—next to the scrolls from Shakespeare and the twig from the gorillas of the cloud forest.

“Let’s go,” she said.

Jack took the research book out of his pack. He left it under the window. Then they climbed down the rope ladder.

As they started through the woods, a warm wind blew, rattling the leaves. Jack felt happy. He was looking forward to visiting their grandmother today and seeing their cousins and aunts and uncles.

“You know, Pilgrim kids had a really hard life,” said Annie.

“Yeah. They did as much work as the grown-ups,” said Jack. “Maybe more.”

“Worst of all, lots of their friends and family members died,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

Both were silent for a moment.

“If they could be so thankful,” said Annie, “we should be really thankful.”

“No kidding,” said Jack. “Really, really thankful.”

And they were.





MORE FACTS FOR

JACK AND ANNIE AND YOU!





In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln designated the last Thursday in November as a national day of Thanksgiving. But in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt changed it to the fourth Thursday in November—in case there were ever five Thursdays in the month.


Wampanoag means “people of the first light.” When the Pilgrims arrived, the Wampanoag people had lived in southeastern New England for thousands of years. They were experts at hunting, fishing, and planting.


Squanto’s real name was Tisquantum. He was a native of the Patuxet people, which belonged to the Wampanoag federation of tribes. The Patuxet had lived in Plymouth before the Pilgrims arrived. But when Squanto returned to Plymouth in 1619 after being kidnapped as a slave, he discovered that all his people had died in a plague in 1617. Since Squanto knew English as well as the language of the Wampanoag, he helped negotiate a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and Chief Massasoit.


Less than half of the original Pilgrims survived their first terrible winter. But after that, their numbers began to grow. More and more people came from England. Within ten years, the population of Plymouth Colony rose to almost 2,000.


Priscilla Mullins was the eighteen-year-old daughter of a shopkeeper. In the “general sickness” of the first year, she lost her parents and her brother. In 1623, Priscilla married another Pilgrim—John Alden, a barrel-maker. Priscilla and John had ten children.


The character of Mary was based on Mary Allerton, who was a small child when the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth. She was the last survivor of the Mayflower’s passengers. She died at Plymouth in 1699, at the age of eighty-three.

Jack and Annie were sitting on their porch, reading books. Jack was reading about gorillas. Annie was reading about Pilgrims.

Suddenly Annie closed her book. She looked up into the sunset.

“Hey!” Annie said with a smile.

Jack looked over at her.

“It’s back!” she said, jumping up.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack. He knew she was talking about the magic tree house. Annie could always tell when it was back.

Jack closed his book and stood up.

“We’re going to the woods!” he called through the screen door. “There’s something we have to check on!”

“Be back before dark!” their mom said.

“We will!” said Jack.

He picked up his backpack. Then he and Annie headed across the yard. When they got to the sidewalk, they started running. They ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

In the last light of day, they hurried between the trees. Finally, they came to the tallest oak. They held their breath as they looked up.

The magic tree house was back.

“Good going,” said Jack.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

She started up the ladder. Jack followed. It was nearly dark inside. But the sun-dried wood smelled like a summer day.

“What kind of special magic will we look for this time?” said Jack.

They glanced around the tree house. They saw the scrolls they’d brought back from Shakespeare’s theater. They saw the twig from the mountain gorillas and the pouch of corn seeds from the first Thanksgiving.

“There!” said Annie. She pointed to a book in the corner. A piece of paper was sticking out of it.

Jack picked up the book. Then he pulled out the paper and read:


Dear Jack and Annie,

Good luck on your fourth journey to find a special magic. This secret rhyme will guide you:

To find a special magic,

build a special kind of ship

that rides the waves,

both high and low,

on every kind of trip.

Thank you,

Morgan


Jack looked at Annie.

“A ship?” he said.

She shrugged. “Yep. I guess we have to build a ship. Where do we go to build it?”

She and Jack looked at the book’s cover. It showed palm trees, a beach, and a beautiful ocean. The title was:

A VISIT TO OLD HAWAII

“Oh, wow!” said Annie. “I love Hawaii!”

“How do you know you love it?” Jack asked. “We’ve never been to Hawaii.”

“Well, we’re going now!” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “We wish we could go there!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Readers,



One snowy day in Connecticut, I wished I could escape to a sunny island. I was far too busy to take a vacation, so I took a trip in my imagination. That’s how I began working on this book about Hawaii.

In my research, I learned that the islands of Hawaii are even more beautiful than I had thought. They began as volcanoes that rose from the sea. Over millions of years, birds and wind brought seeds to the masses of rock. In the perfect climate of the Pacific, trees, flowers, wildlife, and insects thrived. When people discovered the islands, they were amazed by the natural wonders they saw.

This is a big reason why I love being an author so much. By using my imagination, I can go anywhere I want. I can escape the cold weather and feel the fresh, sweet-smelling air of beautiful faraway islands. Wherever you are right now, whatever the season, I hope you’ll use your imagination to escape to Hawaii, too.

Aloha!

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there. While they are gone, no time at all passes in Frog Creek.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian of Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

Jack and Annie have many exciting adventures helping Morgan and exploring different times and places. In Magic Tree House Books #25–28, they learn the art of magic.…

1. A Ship?


Jack and Annie were sitting on their porch, reading books. Jack was reading about gorillas. Annie was reading about Pilgrims.

Suddenly Annie closed her book. She looked up into the sunset.

“Hey!” Annie said with a smile.

Jack looked over at her.

“It’s back!” she said, jumping up.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack. He knew she was talking about the magic tree house. Annie could always tell when it was back.

Jack closed his book and stood up.

“We’re going to the woods!” he called through the screen door. “There’s something we have to check on!”

“Be back before dark!” their mom said.

“We will!” said Jack.

He picked up his backpack. Then he and Annie headed across the yard. When they got to the sidewalk, they started running. They ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

In the last light of day, they hurried between the trees. Finally, they came to the tallest oak. They held their breath as they looked up.

The magic tree house was back.

“Good going,” said Jack.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

She started up the ladder. Jack followed. It was nearly dark inside. But the sun-dried wood smelled like a summer day.

“What kind of special magic will we look for this time?” said Jack.

They glanced around the tree house. They saw the scrolls they’d brought back from Shakespeare’s theater. They saw the twig from the mountain gorillas and the pouch of corn seeds from the first Thanksgiving.

“There!” said Annie. She pointed to a book in the corner. A piece of paper was sticking out of it.

Jack picked up the book. Then he pulled out the paper and read:


Dear Jack and Annie,

Good luck on your fourth journey to find a special magic. This secret rhyme will guide you:

To find a special magic,

build a special kind of ship

that rides the waves,

both high and low,

on every kind of trip.

Thank you,

Morgan


Jack looked at Annie.

“A ship?” he said.

She shrugged. “Yep. I guess we have to build a ship. Where do we go to build it?”

She and Jack looked at the book’s cover. It showed palm trees, a beach, and a beautiful ocean. The title was:

“How do you know you love it?” Jack asked. “We’ve never been to Hawaii.”

“Well, we’re going now!” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “We wish we could go there!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. Aloha!

Jack opened his eyes. A gentle wind brushed against his skin. It smelled sweet and fresh.

Annie looked out the window. “Nice!” she said.

Jack looked out, too. The tree house had landed on top of a tall palm tree. The palm tree was at the edge of a flowery meadow.

On one side of the meadow, a cliff dropped down to the beach and ocean. On the other side of the meadow were the rooftops of a small village.

Beyond the village were tall gray mountains. Misty clouds hid their peaks. Waterfalls gushed down their sides.



“I told you I loved Hawaii!” said Annie. “Don’t you?”

“I have to learn about it first,” said Jack. He pushed his glasses into place and opened their research book. He read aloud:

Hawaii is a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean. The largest island is Hawaii, which gives its name to the whole group. The islands were formed millions of years ago by volcanoes. The volcanoes erupted under the ocean. Over time, their craters rose above the water.



“Wow,” said Annie. “We’re on the top of a volcano.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He read on:

The volcanic rock crumbled and turned to soil. Over millions of years, wind and birds dropped seeds on the islands. Plants and trees began to grow, and birds and insects made their homes.



“Cool,” said Jack. He took out his notebook and pencil and wrote:



He read some more:

About two thousand years ago, people first came to Hawaii. They came in canoes from other islands in the Pacific. They rowed for thousands of miles across the ocean, guided only by the wind and stars.



“Hey, listen,” said Annie.

Jack put down the book and listened. Sounds of music and laughter floated on the breeze.

“There must be a party in that village,” said Annie. “Let’s go.”

“What about building that ship?” asked Jack.

“We’ll figure that out later,” said Annie. “Let’s meet some people at the party. Maybe they can help us.”

She started down the ladder.

Jack heard a whoop of laughter in the distance. The party does sound fun, he thought. He packed up his things and followed Annie down to the ground.

The sun was low in the sky. They walked through the meadow toward the village. Everything was bathed in a golden red glow.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack.

There was beauty everywhere: purple flowers shaped like bells, white flowers that looked like stars, tall, feathery ferns, green spiky plants, big orange-and-black butterflies, and tiny yellow birds.

When they got close to the village, they saw an open area filled with people. Jack and Annie slipped behind a palm tree. They peeked out at the party.

There were about fifty people, including grown-ups, teenagers, and little kids. They were all barefoot and wore wreaths of flowers around their necks.

A woman was chanting. Her words rose and fell like waves. She chanted about a volcano goddess named Pele.

While she chanted, other people played music. Some blew on pipes that looked like flutes. Others shook gourds that sounded like baby rattles. Some hit sticks together to make clicking sounds.

Most of the villagers were dancing to the music. They stepped from side to side. They swayed their hips and waved their hands.

“They’re doing the hula,” whispered Annie. She smiled and waved her hands, too.

“Don’t get carried away,” whispered Jack.

He took out their book and found a picture of Hawaiians dancing. He read:

The early Hawaiians had no written language. They told stories with hula dancing. The hula is a blend of dancing and chanting poetry.



Jack pulled out his notebook. He started a list about early Hawaii:



Suddenly Jack heard loud laughter and clapping. He looked up. Annie was gone!

Jack peeked out from behind the tree. Annie was doing the hula with the dancers! But no one seemed surprised. Everyone just smiled at her as they kept dancing.

A girl caught sight of Jack. She looked about Annie’s age. She had long, shiny black hair and a big, friendly smile.

“Come do the hula!” she called to him.

“No way,” Jack breathed.

He slipped behind the tree again. But the girl danced over to him and took his hand.

“Join us!” she said.

“No thanks,” said Jack.

The girl didn’t let go. She pulled Jack into the open. The music got louder. The dancers and musicians nodded and smiled at Jack.



Jack stood still. He didn’t know how to do any kind of dance, let alone the hula! He stared at the ground, clutching his backpack and notebook until the music and dancing ended.

The Hawaiians gathered around Jack and Annie. They all had friendly, open faces.

“Who are you?” the young girl asked.

“I’m Annie,” said Annie. “This is my brother, Jack.”

“I’m Kama,” the girl said. “This is my brother, Boka.” She pointed to a boy in the crowd who looked about Jack’s age.

The boy stepped forward. He grinned a big grin just like his sister’s. He pulled off his wreath of red fluffy flowers. He put it around Annie’s neck.

“A lei to welcome you,” Boka said.

Kama then pulled off her lei and put it around Jack’s neck.

“Aloha, Jack and Annie!” everyone said.

3. Sleepover

“Aloha,” said Jack and Annie.

“Where did you come from?” a pretty woman asked.

“Frog—” Annie started.

But Jack broke in. “From over the mountains,” he said quickly. He pointed at the mountains looming in the distance.

“We are glad you have come to visit us,” the woman said.

Everyone smiled and nodded.

They’re all amazingly nice, Jack thought.

The music started again. As people began to dance, Kama took Annie’s hand.

“Sit and talk with us,” she said.

She and Boka led Jack and Annie to the edge of the clearing. They sat cross-legged in the grass. Kama picked up a wooden bowl. She held it out.

“Please eat,” she said.

“What is it?” asked Annie.

“It is poi,” said Kama. She scooped some poi out of the bowl and licked it off of her fingers.

“You eat it with your hands? Cool,” said Annie. She stuck her fingers in the bowl and licked off the poi. “Mmm … good.”

Jack stuck his finger in the bowl, too. The gooey mixture felt like peanut butter. But when he licked it off his finger, it had a weird taste—both bitter and sweet.

“Hmm,” he said, but he made a face.

“He doesn’t like it,” Kama said to Boka.

“No, no,” said Jack. “It’s … ” He tried to think of something polite.… “It’s very interesting.”

Kama and Boka giggled. Then they stuck their fingers in the bowl and ate some poi.

“Interesting!” they exclaimed. They cracked up laughing. Jack and Annie laughed with them.

“Now tell us about your home over the mountains,” said Kama, “this place you call ‘Frog.’ ”

Kama’s friendly smile made Jack want to tell her the truth.

“It’s actually called Frog Creek,” he said. “It’s very far away—much farther than just over the mountains. We traveled here in a magic tree house.”

Kama’s and Boka’s eyes got huge. They smiled even bigger smiles than before.

“That sounds fun!” said Kama.

“You are so lucky!” said Boka.

Jack and Annie laughed.

“Yeah, we are,” said Jack. He felt great telling their new friends about the tree house. He and Annie had never talked about it with their friends back home.

“Can you stay here tonight?” asked Kama.

Jack shrugged. “Sure, we can stay at least one night,” he said.

Kama hurried over to the pretty woman. They spoke together for a moment. Then Kama returned to Jack and Annie.

“Our mother invites you to sleep at our house,” she said.

“Great,” said Annie. “Thanks.”

Jack and Annie stood up. In the gray twilight, they followed Kama and Boka through the village. They wove between small huts with steep roofs until Kama stopped in front of one.

“This is our house,” she said.

The hut had no door—just a wide entrance that opened into one large room.

Kama and Boka led Jack and Annie inside. In the dim light, Jack could barely see the dried-grass walls and the woven-grass mats on the dirt floor.

“Where do we sleep?” he asked.

“Here!” said Boka.

He and Kama lay down on the mats. Annie pulled off her lei and shoes. Then she lay down, too.

“Oh,” said Jack. “Okay.”

He took off his shoes and wreath of flowers. He used his backpack as a pillow when he lay down. The warm wind rustled the palm leaves outside. Music drifted in from the party.

“The ocean is calling,” said Kama.

Jack could barely hear the waves in the distance.

“Tomorrow we will take you wave riding,” said Boka.

“You mean surfing?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Kama.

“Cool,” said Jack. But he wasn’t sure he meant it. Surfing actually seemed pretty scary.

Kama seemed to hear his thoughts. “Don’t worry,” she said. “We’ll have fun.”

“No kidding,” said Annie.

Soon Jack heard steady breathing. The other kids had fallen asleep.

Oh darn, we forgot to ask them about building a ship, he thought. I guess we’ll have to do that tomorrow.…

Jack closed his eyes and yawned. Soon he, too, was fast asleep.

4. Garden Paradise


Jack heard pounding noises. He imagined Boka and Kama were building a ship.

He opened his eyes. Only he and Annie were still in the hut. A piece of cloth covered the doorway. Jack sat up and shook Annie.

“Wake up!” he said.

She opened her eyes.

“I think they’re building a ship outside,” said Jack. “Come on, let’s go.”

Annie jumped up.

“Don’t forget your lei,” she said.

They put on their flower wreaths. Jack lifted the cloth over the doorway, and they stepped out into the warm sunlight.

Boka, Kama, and their parents smiled at Jack and Annie. They were all working. But no one was building a ship.

Boka was pounding a wide strip of bark with a wooden club. Kama was using a stone to pound something that looked like a fat sweet potato. Their parents were weaving grass mats.

“What are you making?” Jack asked.

“I’m making tapa,” said Boka. “First I beat the bark of the mulberry tree into thin sheets. Then my father pastes the sheets together to make cloth for us.”

“This is the root of a taro plant,” said Kama. She pointed at the squashed white vegetable. “When you add fruit to it, you get poi.”



“Great,” said Jack. “By the way, do you ever build ships?”

“Ships?” asked Boka. “What for?”

Jack shrugged. “To sail away?” he said.

“Why would we do that?” asked Kama.

“Good question,” said Jack, smiling.

“Can I help?” Annie asked Kama.

“Sure,” said Kama. While she showed Annie how to pound the taro root, Jack slipped back into the hut. He pulled out his notebook and quickly added to his Hawaii list:



Jack heard Kama ask her parents if they could play now.

“We’ve finished our chores,” said Kama. “May we take Jack and Annie to the ocean?”

“For wave riding,” said Boka.

Jack held his breath. He half hoped their parents would say no.

“Yes, go have a good time with your friends,” said their father.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie called.

Jack put his notebook away. He pulled on his pack and joined the others outside.

“We’ll be back in a little while,” said Kama.

“Don’t forget to eat breakfast!” said her mother.

“We won’t,” said Kama.

Where will we get breakfast? wondered Jack.

He and Annie followed Kama and Boka. They passed villagers hard at work. Some carried firewood or water. Others were cutting grass or stripping bark from trees. Everyone smiled and waved.

“Hungry?” Kama asked Jack and Annie.

“Sure,” they said.

Kama and Boka went into the grove of palms near the huts. They climbed up two slanting tree trunks, using their hands and feet to push themselves up. At the top, they shook the palm leaves.

“Watch out!” Kama shouted.

Jack and Annie jumped back as big, round coconuts fell to the ground.

Kama and Boka slid down the trees. They each picked up a coconut. Then they found rocks and began to whack the hard shells. They whacked and whacked until their coconuts cracked into halves.

Kama shared hers with Annie. Boka shared his with Jack.

Jack drank the fresh, sweet milk inside the coconut. “Mmm!” he said.

“Interesting?” asked Boka.

“No. Mmm means good!” said Jack.

Everyone laughed.

Then Kama picked bananas off a banana tree and gave them to Jack and Annie. Jack peeled his and took a bite. It was the best banana he’d ever eaten.

When breakfast was over, they all headed into the flowery meadow. The sky was the bluest blue Jack had ever seen. The grass was the greenest green. The flowers and birds sparkled like jewels.

Hawaii is like a garden paradise, Jack thought.

He wanted to look up Hawaiian birds and flowers in the research book. As the others kept walking, he stopped and pulled out the book.

“Jack! Come look!” Annie shouted. She was standing at the edge of a cliff with Boka and Kama.

Jack put away the book and hurried to join the others. He looked down at a beach fifty feet below.

There were no people. Only seashells and seaweed lay on the glistening white sand. Big, foamy waves crashed against the shore.

“Wow!” said Annie.

Uh-oh, thought Jack.

5. GO!


Boka looked at Jack and grinned.

“Ready?” he asked.

“I’m ready!” said Annie. “Where do we get our surfboards?”

“Down there,” said Kama. She pointed to a rocky path that led to the beach.

“Let’s go,” said Annie.

Annie, Boka, and Kama started down the path. Jack followed, moving slowly and carefully.



When he stepped onto the beach, Jack slipped off his shoes. He dug his toes into the dry, warm sand. It felt as soft as silk.

“Actually, I wouldn’t mind just taking a walk on the beach,” he said to the others.

But no one seemed to hear. They had all walked over to a row of wooden surfboards propped against the rocks.

Boka picked out a long board and lugged it over to Jack. “For you,” he said.

Jack took the board and looked up at it. It was as tall as his dad.

“Isn’t this a little big for me?” he asked.

Boka shook his head. He chose a board for Annie. Then he and Kama grabbed a couple for themselves.

Jack took a deep breath. “I’d like to read a little about surfing first,” he said. He put his board down and pulled out the research book.

“What is that?” asked Kama.

“It’s a book,” said Jack. “It tells you about things.”

“How does it talk?” said Kama.

“It doesn’t talk,” said Annie. “You read it.”

Kama looked confused.

“Jack, forget the book now,” Annie said. “Let’s just do what Boka and Kama tell us.” She headed for the ocean, lugging her board.

Jack sighed and put the book away. He left his pack in the sand, picked up his board, and followed the others.

They all stopped at the edge of the water.

“First we need to get past the breaking waves,” said Kama. “Then we’ll show you what to do next.”

Together they waded into the cool, shallow water. The waves don’t seem all that big, Jack thought hopefully.

But as he waded deeper into the ocean, the breaking waves began to look bigger and bigger. When the first wave hit him, Jack leaned against it, lifting his board. He nearly fell over.

Kama, Boka, and Annie moved farther out into the ocean. Jack watched as a wave loomed over them. They all threw their boards over the wave and dove into it.

Jack struggled forward. The next time a big wave came toward him, he threw his board over it. Holding his glasses tightly, he ducked under.

When Jack stood up again, he wiped the water from his eyes and glasses. His surfboard was close by. He grabbed it before another wave came.

Jack kept fighting his way forward. By the time he got past all the breakers, the water was up to his chest.

“We’ll paddle out to catch a big wave!” said Boka.

Jack frowned. “But—”

“Don’t worry, Jack,” said Kama. “It will be fun!”

Boka and Kama pulled themselves onto their boards. They lay on their bellies and began paddling with their hands out to sea.

Jack and Annie lay down on their boards, too. Paddling over the gentle waves, Jack relaxed. Now, this was something he could do all day.

“When I say go, paddle fast back toward the shore!” said Kama.

“When do we stand up?” said Annie.

“When you start toward the shore!” said Boka. “Stand up with one foot forward. Stretch out your arms to keep your balance!”

“But don’t try to stand up the very first time!” said Kama. “Just ride your board on your belly!”

“I see one coming now!” said Boka.

“Wait, wait!” said Jack. Everything was happening too fast. He had questions.

“Go!” Kama shouted.

Jack saw a big wave rolling toward them. Before he knew it, Boka, Kama, and Annie were paddling quickly toward the shore. Jack paddled like crazy to keep up.

Suddenly the wave lifted him and swept him forward! Jack zoomed toward the shore with amazing speed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Boka and Kama—and Annie!—all standing up.



Jack wanted to be like them. In a flash, he went up on his knees. He put his left foot forward and stood up! For one second he felt like a soaring bird—then he lost his balance!

Jack fell into the water, grabbing his glasses just in time. The wave crashed down on top of him! Water filled his mouth and went up his nose. His board and his lei were swept away.

Jack twisted and turned in the churning water. When his head bobbed up above the water, he choked and coughed.

Another big wave crashed down on him, and he went under again. When he came up, he plunged forward, desperately trying to get to shore.

Again and again, Jack was thrown down and slammed by breaking waves. But each time, he got up and hurled himself closer to shore.

Finally, Jack dragged himself out of the ocean. Feeling bruised and battered, he fell onto the sand.

6. Shake-up

“Jack!” cried Annie. She ran to him. “Are you okay?”

Jack just nodded. He put on his wet glasses. He felt shaky and mad at himself. I never should have tried to stand! he thought.

Kama picked up Jack’s surfboard from the shallow water and brought it over to him.

“I told you not to stand,” she said, laughing. “You fell hard.”

It’s not funny, thought Jack. I nearly drowned!

“The best thing to do is to go right back out,” said Boka.

“You go,” said Jack. His eyes and nose burned from the salt water. “I’ll stay here.” He walked over to his pack, picked it up, and took out the research book.

“Come on, Jack!” said Annie. “Try it again! Stay on your belly this time!”

“No, this time I’m going to read about surfing first,” he said.

“Aw, you should just try it again,” said Annie. “Not read about it!”

She ran to him and pulled the book out of his hands. Jack jerked it away from her. He slipped and fell onto the sand.

Kama and Boka laughed again.

“Why are you laughing?” Jack snapped. “You don’t even know how to read!”

Boka and Kama looked hurt.

“Jack!” said Annie. “That was mean. Say you’re sorry.”

Jack opened his book and pretended to read it. He did feel sorry, but he was too upset to say so.

“Fine, stay here,” said Annie. She went back to Boka and Kama. “Let’s go.”

As Jack sat alone on the beach, he looked up from his book. He watched the other kids paddling through the water.

“I don’t care,” he muttered. “I’m never going back out in those waves.”

Morgan didn’t send us here to surf anyway, he thought. She told us to build a ship. But how the heck are we supposed to do that?

Jack heaved an angry sigh. Now he was cross with Morgan. He turned to the back of the book and searched the index for “ship.”

Suddenly Jack heard a rumbling from under the sand. The ground started to shake. It shook so hard, the book flew out of Jack’s hands!

Jack bounced up and down on the beach. Shells were jumping up and down, too. Rocks tumbled down from the cliff.

It’s an earthquake! thought Jack.

The rumbling stopped.

The shaking stopped.

Jack looked around. Everything was normal again, except some rocks rolled around at the bottom of the cliff.

Jack looked out to sea. Kama, Boka, and Annie were past the breakers. They were sitting on their surfboards, laughing and talking.

Everything seemed okay. But Jack felt sure that something was wrong. He grabbed the Hawaii book from the sand. He looked up “earthquake.” He read:

Earthquakes in Hawaii have been known to cause tsunamis (soo-NAH-meez), which used to be called “tidal waves.” An earthquake can cause water out at sea to be set in motion. The water grows higher and higher as it moves toward land. Just before the tsunami strikes, water may pull away from the shore. Then it returns in a gigantic wave that crashes over the land and washes everything away.



Oh, man! thought Jack. A tsunami might be coming!

OceanofPDF.com


7. Ride for Your Lives!


Jack had to find out more about tsunamis quickly. He read as fast as he could:

A tsunami can strike a few hours—or a few minutes!—after an earthquake. It depends on the strength of the earthquake and where it took place. After earthquakes, it is safest for islanders to seek higher ground.



We have to get to higher ground now! thought Jack, dropping the book.

He ran down to the edge of the ocean. Boka, Kama, and Annie were still paddling out beyond the waves. Jack forgot all about their fight.

“Hey, you guys!” he yelled.

They didn’t hear him.

Jack went into the shallow water. “Hey, you guys!” he yelled. “Come back!”

They still didn’t hear him.

Jack ran to his surfboard, grabbed it, and ran into the ocean. He fought the breaking waves. Once he was past them, he threw himself on his board and paddled wildly.

The wave swells grew as he paddled. He could hardly see Annie, Boka, or Kama over them. Jack paddled faster and faster, trying to reach them.

“Hey!” he yelled. “Hey!”

Boka looked back at him. He gave Jack a friendly wave, then turned away again.

I have to get them to come to me! Jack thought frantically. “HELP! HELP!” he yelled at the top of his lungs.

The three kids jerked around. They paddled quickly toward Jack with worried faces.

“What’s wrong?” Annie cried when they got closer. “Are you in trouble?”

“We all are!” said Jack. “A tsunami might be coming! There was an earthquake when I was on the beach!”

“We’d better ride in fast!” said Boka.

“Stay on your bellies!” said Kama. “It’s safer!”

“Here comes a wave!” cried Boka.

They all started paddling.

The swell of the wave picked them up. They were all swept forward!

Jack gripped the sides of his board as he zoomed along with the others. Suddenly he dropped down as the wave curled under. It felt like a roller coaster! But he stayed on his board as the wave carried him to shore.

Jack rolled off into the shallow water. He snatched up his board and ran onto the sand. Boka and Kama were waiting.

“Good riding, Jack!” said Boka.

“Where’s Annie?” asked Jack.

Boka pointed. Annie was in the shallow water, pulling her board in. As they watched, something very weird began to happen to the ocean.

The water around Annie started to pull away.

OceanofPDF.com



8. The Big Wave

“Run, Annie!” Jack screamed.

The water drew away from the beach, and a loud hissing sound came from the sea.

Suddenly fish flopped on the bare sand!

Annie threw down her board and ran. She grabbed Jack’s hand as she ran by him. Jack grabbed Boka’s hand, and Boka grabbed Kama’s hand. They all ran together, pulling each other along as they raced to the cliff.

Boka and Kama ran up the cliff path. Jack and Annie grabbed their shoes and Jack’s pack. Then they scrambled up the path, too.

At the top of the cliff, everyone looked back. Jack couldn’t believe his eyes!



A wave was rising up like a dark mountain of water. It came surging toward the shore, growing even taller!

“Wow,” whispered Annie.

“Get back!” shouted Boka.

The four of them bolted back from the edge of the rocky slope. The mountain of water crashed against the cliff. Water sprayed over the top of the rocks and rained down on them.

When the water rolled back over the cliff, they all hurried back to the edge to see what had happened.

The rocky cliff path was gone. The gigantic wave was moving back out to sea, taking rocks, sand, seaweed, seashells, and the surfboards with it.

“Scary,” breathed Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “We just made it.”

“Boka! Kama!” voices yelled.

They turned around. Jack saw Boka and Kama’s parents racing across the meadow toward them. Other villagers followed.

The two Hawaiian kids ran into their parents’ arms. Soon Jack and Annie were surrounded by villagers. Everyone was laughing and crying and hugging each other.

Jack hugged Annie. He hugged Kama and Boka and their parents—and lots of other people he didn’t even know.

OceanofPDF.com



9. Telling the Story

Finally, the hugging and crying and laughing died down. The villagers started walking back to their huts.

Jack and Annie followed Boka, Kama, and their parents.

“We felt the ground shaking,” said Boka and Kama’s father. “We knew a big wave might follow!”

“Jack saved us!” said Boka. “He read in a book and found out about the big waves.”

“What’s a book?” asked his mother.

“Show them,” Annie said to Jack.

Jack reached into his pack and took out their research book.

“It tells about the big waves in here,” he said. “Books give lots of information.”

“Ah,” said Boka and Kama’s mother. “A book is a good thing.”

“Books tell stories, too,” said Annie.

“That is impossible,” said Kama. “The book cannot move its feet or wave its hands. It cannot sing or chant.”

“That’s true,” said Jack, smiling.

“Now we should do the hula,” Boka said to Annie, Kama, and Jack, “and tell our story.”

“I’ll watch,” said Jack, stepping away.

Boka and Kama’s father called for music.

The villagers gathered around. A man started to play a pipe. A teenage boy knocked two sticks together. Some women began shaking rattles.

Boka, Kama, and Annie waved their hands in time to the music. They stepped from side to side. They swayed their hips.

Kama chanted about going out into the water. She, Boka, and Annie waved their hands to show how they paddled out to sea.

Kama chanted about how Jack had warned them. She and the others waved their hands to show how they rode their surfboards to shore.

Then Jack surprised himself. He waved his hands to show how he rode his surfboard like a bird soaring through the air. The next thing he knew, he was stepping from side to side. He was swaying his hips. He was doing the hula!



Kama chanted about how the water had pulled away from the shore—and how they had climbed to safety—and how the giant wave had crashed against the cliff.

As Kama chanted the story, all the villagers joined in the dance. The tall grasses swayed. The palm trees swayed. And all the hula dancers swayed, too.

When the story ended, everyone clapped.

“Thanks for helping us,” Boka said to Jack and Annie.

“We’re a good team,” said Annie.

“We are best friends,” said Kama.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “I’m sorry I said mean things.”

“We’re sorry we laughed at you,” said Boka.

“I’m sorry I grabbed the book,” said Annie.

“Our mother says friendship is like riding the waves,” said Kama. “Sometimes you ride low, gentle waves. Sometimes you ride high, rough ones.”

Annie gasped. She looked at Jack. She repeated Morgan’s rhyme:


To find a special magic,

build a special kind of ship

that rides the waves,

both high and low,

on every kind of trip.


“Friendship! That’s the ship!” said Jack.

“And we built it!” said Annie.

She and Jack burst out laughing.

Boka and Kama looked a little confused, but they laughed, too.

“We have to go back to our own home now,” Annie said to Boka and Kama.

“It’s time to say good-bye,” said Jack.

“We never say good-bye,” said Kama. “We say aloha when we greet our friends. And we say aloha when we leave them.”

“Friends are always together,” said Boka, “even when they are far apart.”

“Have a good journey in your magic tree house,” said Kama.

“Thanks,” said Jack and Annie. They waved to all the villagers. “Aloha!”

“Aloha!” everyone called back.

Then Annie and Jack started through the meadow. Tiny yellow birds and orange-and-black butterflies flitted about them.

At the edge of the meadow, they came to the grove of palm trees. They climbed up the rope ladder into the tree house.

Out the window, Jack saw the tall mountains, the small village, the flowery meadow, and the ocean. The water was peaceful again.

“I still have my lei,” said Annie.

She took it off. Though the red flowers were wet, they were still a little fluffy.

“It’s proof that we found the special magic,” said Jack. “The magic of friendship.”

Annie put the lei on the floor next to the play scrolls, the twig, and the corn seeds. Then she picked up the Pennsylvania book.

“Ready?” she asked.

Jack sighed. “I love Hawaii,” he said.

“Finally, you admit it,” said Annie. She pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go home now.”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

10. Everyday Magic


Jack opened his eyes.

The sun was setting beyond the woods. No time at all had passed in Frog Creek.

“Welcome back,” said a soft, lovely voice.

Morgan le Fay was in the magic tree house.

“Morgan!” cried Annie. She threw her arms around the enchantress.

Jack hugged Morgan, too.



“Look, Morgan,” said Annie. “We have proof we found four special kinds of magic!”

“Yes, I see,” said Morgan.

Morgan picked up the play scrolls that Shakespeare had given Jack and Annie in old England.

“You found the magic of theater,” she said.

Morgan picked up the twig from a mountain gorilla in the African cloud forest.

“And the magic of animals,” she said.

Morgan picked up the pouch of corn seeds from their trip to the first Thanksgiving.

“And the magic of community,” she said.

Finally, Morgan picked up the wreath of flowers from Kama and Boka.

“And you discovered the magic of friendship,” she said.

Morgan looked at Jack and Annie for a long moment. “Listen carefully to what I’m about to tell you,” she said.

“Yes?” They both leaned forward.

“You are now Magicians of Everyday Magic,” said Morgan. “You have learned to find the magic in things you encounter on earth every day. There are many other forms of everyday magic. You never have to look far to find it. You only have to live your life to the fullest.”

Jack and Annie nodded.

Soon you will be called upon to use your knowledge of Everyday Magic in the realm of fantasy.”

“The realm of fantasy?” said Jack.

“Are we going back to Camelot?” said Annie.

Before Morgan could answer, a shout came from the distance. “Jack! Annie!”

“Our dad’s calling,” said Annie.

“You must go home now,” said Morgan gently. “Rest—and get ready to test your powers. Your most exciting challenges are yet to come.”

“Good-bye, Morgan,” said Annie and Jack.

They hugged the enchantress. Then Jack took the Hawaii book out of his pack and gave it to Morgan. He put on his backpack and followed Annie down the ladder.

When they stepped onto the ground, there was a great roar above them. Jack and Annie looked up. A swirl of sparkling light lit the top of the tree.

Then the light was gone. The tree house was gone. Morgan le Fay was gone, too.

Jack and Annie didn’t speak for a long moment. Then Jack broke the silence.

“Our most exciting challenges are yet to come?” he said. “What do you think Morgan meant by that?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie.

“It sounds a little scary,” said Jack

“That’s okay. We can handle it,” said Annie. She smiled. “We’re Magicians of Everyday Magic.”

Jack smiled. “Yeah,” he said. “I guess we are.”

They walked out of the woods as the sun was setting. Down the street their mom and dad were standing on their front porch. They waved at Jack and Annie.

Jack felt a surge of happiness. There’s another kind of everyday magic, he thought, the magic of family.

In that moment, it seemed the best magic of all.

MORE FACTS FOR

JACK AND ANNIE AND YOU!

Tsunamis were once called “tidal waves.” Scientists no longer call them that because the waves have nothing to do with tides.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning System alerts the public of earthquakes or other disturbances that take place at sea. It puts out warnings on radio and TV. Sirens may also sound warnings. The warnings alert people to stay away from beaches and move to higher ground.

When the first Polynesians arrived in the Hawaiian islands 1,500 years ago, they brought the custom of riding surfboards with them.



According to one ancient Hawaiian legend, hula dancing began when Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, told her younger sister, Laka, to dance. Laka is now known as the goddess of song and dance and as the patroness of hula dancers. Today, the hula is studied and practiced by people from many different cultures.

Because of Hawaii’s isolation, many of its plants and birds and insects are found nowhere else on earth. Sadly, many of them today are on the U.S. endangered species list.

CHAPTER ONE

A Royal Invitation


Sunlight had faded from the late-afternoon sky. Puffy snow clouds were moving in.

“Let’s hurry. I’m cold,” said Jack.

He and Annie were walking home from school. Their Christmas vacation was just beginning.

Cooo—cooo.

“Wait,” said Annie. “Look.”

She pointed to a white bird sitting on a bare tree branch at the edge of the woods. The bird was staring straight at them.

“It’s a dove,” said Jack.

“It’s a messenger,” said Annie, “from Morgan.”

“No,” Jack said, afraid to get his hopes up. They hadn’t seen Morgan le Fay in a long time. He really missed her.

“Yes,” said Annie. “She has a mission for us. I can feel it.”

In the hush of the cold twilight, the dove spread its wings and flew into the Frog Creek woods.

“Come on!” said Annie. “The tree house is back!”

“You’re just hoping!” said Jack.

“I’m knowing!” said Annie. She ran into the woods, following the white dove.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. But he took off after Annie.

Even in the growing darkness, they easily found their way. They zigzagged between the bare trees and ran over the frozen ground until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“See?” said Annie, pointing to the top of the tree.

“Yeah,” whispered Jack.

There it was: the magic tree house.

“Morgan!” shouted Annie.

Jack held his breath, waiting to see the enchantress at the tree house window. But Morgan did not appear.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack saw something lying on the floor. It was a scroll, rolled up and tied with a red velvet ribbon.

Jack picked up the scroll and unrolled it. The thick, yellowed paper shimmered with large gold writing.

“Wow, Morgan sent us a really fancy note,” said Annie.

“It’s an invitation,” said Jack. “Listen.”



“Christmas in Camelot!” said Annie. “I don’t believe it!”

“Cool,” whispered Jack. He pictured a beautiful, glowing castle lit with candles and filled with knights and ladies feasting and singing.

“We’re going to celebrate Christmas with Morgan and King Arthur!” said Annie. “And Queen Guinevere!”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “And the Knights of the Round Table, like Sir Lancelot!”

“Let’s go!” said Annie. “Where’s the book?”

She and Jack looked around the tree house for a book about Camelot. The only book they saw was the Pennsylvania book that always brought them home.

“That’s strange,” said Jack. “Morgan didn’t send a book about Camelot with the Royal Invitation. How does she expect us to get there?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Maybe she forgot.”

Jack picked up the invitation. He read it again. He turned it over, hoping to find more information. The back of the scroll was blank. He handed the invitation to Annie.

“She must have forgotten,” he said.

“Darn,” said Annie, staring at the gold writing. “I really wish we could go to Camelot.”

The tree branches rustled.

The wind began to blow.

“What’s happening?” said Jack.

“I don’t know—” said Annie.

“Wait a minute,” said Jack. “You were holding the invitation, and you made a wish.… ”

The wind blew harder.

“That must have made the magic work!” cried Annie.

Jack felt a surge of joy.

“We’re going to Camelot!” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

HAWAII TIMETABLE

Millions of years ago, volcanoes rose from the Pacific Ocean to form the islands of Hawaii.

Around 1,500 years ago, Polynesians came to Hawaii. They were the first people to discover the islands. They traveled over 3,000 miles in wooden canoes from other islands in the Pacific.

In 1778, an Englishman named Captain James Cook made the first recorded European visit to Hawaii.

On August 21, 1959, Hawaii became the fiftieth state of the United States.

Today, over 6 million tourists from all over the world visit Hawaii every year.

For Mallory Loehr,

the real Keeper of the Cauldron




O brother, had you known our Camelot,

Built by old kings, age after age, so old

The King himself had fears that it would fall,

So strange, and rich, and dim …

Alfred Lord Tennyson

Idylls of the King





Once upon a time, in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A boy named Jack and his sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places they read about in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there. They discovered that during their adventures, no time at all passed in Frog Creek.

Jack and Annie eventually learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, an enchantress from Camelot, the long-ago kingdom of King Arthur. On one of their journeys, Jack and Annie visited Morgan’s library in Camelot and brought hope and courage to King Arthur.

Now it is winter. Jack and Annie have not seen Morgan or the magic tree house for many months.…



1. A Royal Invitation

Sunlight had faded from the late-afternoon sky. Puffy snow clouds were moving in.

“Let’s hurry. I’m cold,” said Jack.

He and Annie were walking home from school. Their Christmas vacation was just beginning.

Cooo—cooo.

“Wait,” said Annie. “Look.”

She pointed to a white bird sitting on a bare tree branch at the edge of the woods. The bird was staring straight at them.

“It’s a dove,” said Jack.

“It’s a messenger,” said Annie, “from Morgan.”

“No,” Jack said, afraid to get his hopes up. They hadn’t seen Morgan le Fay in a long time. He really missed her.

“Yes,” said Annie. “She has a mission for us. I can feel it.”

In the hush of the cold twilight, the dove spread its wings and flew into the Frog Creek woods.

“Come on!” said Annie. “The tree house is back!”

“You’re just hoping!” said Jack.

“I’m knowing!” said Annie. She ran into the woods, following the white dove.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. But he took off after Annie.

Even in the growing darkness, they easily found their way. They zigzagged between the bare trees and ran over the frozen ground until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“See?” said Annie, pointing to the top of the tree.

“Yeah,” whispered Jack.

There it was: the magic tree house.

“Morgan!” shouted Annie.

Jack held his breath, waiting to see the enchantress at the tree house window. But Morgan did not appear.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack saw something lying on the floor. It was a scroll, rolled up and tied with a red velvet ribbon.

Jack picked up the scroll and unrolled it. The thick, yellowed paper shimmered with large gold writing.

“Wow, Morgan sent us a really fancy note,” said Annie.

“It’s an invitation,” said Jack. “Listen.”



“Christmas in Camelot!” said Annie. “I don’t believe it!”

“Cool,” whispered Jack. He pictured a beautiful, glowing castle lit with candles and filled with knights and ladies feasting and singing.

“We’re going to celebrate Christmas with Morgan and King Arthur!” said Annie. “And Queen Guinevere!”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “And the Knights of the Round Table, like Sir Lancelot!”

“Let’s go!” said Annie. “Where’s the book?”

She and Jack looked around the tree house for a book about Camelot. The only book they saw was the Pennsylvania book that always brought them home.

“That’s strange,” said Jack. “Morgan didn’t send a book about Camelot with the Royal Invitation. How does she expect us to get there?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Maybe she forgot.”

Jack picked up the invitation. He read it again. He turned it over, hoping to find more information. The back of the scroll was blank. He handed the invitation to Annie.

“She must have forgotten,” he said.

“Darn,” said Annie, staring at the gold writing. “I really wish we could go to Camelot.”

The tree branches rustled.

The wind began to blow.

“What’s happening?” said Jack.

“I don’t know—” said Annie.

“Wait a minute,” said Jack. “You were holding the invitation, and you made a wish.… ”

The wind blew harder.

“That must have made the magic work!” cried Annie.

Jack felt a surge of joy.

“We’re going to Camelot!” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. This Is Camelot?


Jack shivered. He could see his breath in the dim light.

Annie was staring out the window. “This is Camelot?” she said.

Jack looked out with her. The tree house had landed in a grove of tall, bare trees. A huge, dark castle loomed against the gray sky. No light shone from its windows. No banners waved from its turrets. Wind whistled through its tall towers, sounding sad and lonely.

“It looks deserted,” said Annie.



“Yeah,” said Jack. “I hope we came to the right place.”

Jack pulled his notebook and pencil out of his pack. He wanted to write a description of the dark castle.

“Hey, I see someone,” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window again.

A woman was crossing the castle drawbridge. She wore a long cloak and carried a lantern. Her white hair blew in the wind.



“Morgan!” said Annie and Jack together. They laughed with relief.

Morgan hurried over the frost-covered ground toward the grove of trees. “Annie? Jack? Is that you?” she called.

“Of course! Who’d you think?” shouted Annie. She started down from the tree house.

Jack threw his notebook into his backpack. He followed Annie down the rope ladder. When they reached the icy ground, they ran to Morgan and both threw their arms around her.

“I was looking out a window in the castle and saw a bright flash in the orchard,” said Morgan. “What are you doing here?”

“You didn’t send the tree house for us?” asked Jack.

“With a Royal Invitation to spend Christmas in Camelot?” asked Annie.

“No!” said Morgan. She sounded alarmed.

“But the invitation was signed with an M,” said Jack.

“I don’t understand … ,” said Morgan. “We are not celebrating Christmas in Camelot this year.”

“You aren’t?” said Jack.

“Why not?” said Annie.

A look of sadness crossed Morgan’s face. “Do you remember when you visited my library and gave King Arthur the hope and courage to challenge his enemy?” she asked.

“Sure,” said Jack.

“Well, Arthur’s enemy was a man named Mordred,” said Morgan. “After you left, Arthur defeated him, but not before Mordred’s Dark Wizard cast a spell over the whole kingdom. The spell robbed Camelot of all its joy.”

“What? All its joy?” whispered Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “For months, Camelot has been without music, without celebration, and without laughter.”

“Oh, no,” said Annie.

“What can we do to help?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled sadly. “This time, I don’t think you can do anything,” she said. “But perhaps it will lift Arthur’s spirits to see you both again. Come, let us go inside the castle.”

Morgan held up her lantern and started toward the drawbridge.

Jack and Annie hurried after her. As they walked through the outer courtyard, the frozen grass cracked under their sneakers.

They followed Morgan over the bridge and through a tall gate. There were no signs of life in the castle’s inner courtyard.

“Where is everyone?” Annie whispered to Jack.

“I don’t know,” he whispered back. Jack really wished they had a book about Camelot. It might help them understand what was going on.

Morgan led them to a huge archway with two wooden doors. She stopped and looked at them.

“I am afraid no book would help you tonight, Jack,” she said.

Jack was startled that Morgan had read his thoughts.

“Why not?” asked Annie.

“On all your other journeys, you visited real places and times in history,” said Morgan. “Camelot is different.”

“How?” said Jack.

“The story of Camelot is a legend,” said Morgan. “A legend is a story that begins in truth. But then imagination takes over. Different people in different times tell the story. They use their imaginations to add new parts. That is how a legend is kept alive.”

“Tonight we’ll add our part,” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “And please, I beg you”—in the lantern light, she looked very serious—“do not let the story of Camelot end forever. Keep our kingdom alive.”

“Of course we will!” said Annie.

“Good,” said Morgan. “Come, then. Let us go into the great hall and see the king.”

Morgan lifted an iron latch and pushed open the heavy doors. Jack and Annie followed her into the dark castle.



3. The Knights of the Round Table

A pair of torches dimly lit the drafty entrance hall of the castle. Shadows danced on the worn tapestries.

“Wait here,” said Morgan. “I will tell the king of your arrival.” She headed through the huge stone archway that led to the great hall.

“Let’s peek in,” Annie said to Jack.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He and Annie walked quietly over to the big arch and peered in.



The ceiling of the great hall towered high above a stone floor. At the far end of the room, King Arthur and his knights were sitting around a huge, round table. They all wore brown tunics. They had shaggy hair and beards. Their names were carved in gold letters on the backs of their chairs.

“The Knights of the Round Table!” whispered Jack.

Morgan was talking to King Arthur. Beside the king sat a woman in a plain gray robe. She had pale skin and brown, curly hair.

“Queen Guinevere,” whispered Annie.

Morgan left the king, and Jack and Annie moved quickly back into the shadows. A moment later, Morgan appeared.

“I told the king that two special friends of his have just arrived,” she said. “Come with me.”

As they walked with Morgan through the great hall, Jack shivered. The huge room was drafty and damp. There was no fire in the fireplace. The stone floor was so cold that Jack could feel the chill through his sneakers.

They stopped near the Round Table. King Arthur stared at them with his piercing gray eyes.

“Greetings from Frog Creek,” Annie said to the king and queen. Annie bowed, and Jack bowed, too.

The queen smiled. But King Arthur did not.

“Your Majesty, you remember Jack and Annie?” said Morgan. “You met them last summer in my library?”

“Indeed, I shall never forget them,” King Arthur said softly. “Greetings, Annie. Greetings, Jack. How do you come to be in Camelot on this bleak night?”

“We came in the magic tree house,” said Annie.

A shadow crossed the king’s face. He looked at Morgan.

“No, Your Majesty. I did not use my magic to bring them here,” she said. “Perhaps a bit of magic still lingers in the tree house, and it traveled on its own.”

What’s going on? Jack wondered. Why does King Arthur seem unhappy about the magic tree house?

King Arthur looked back at Jack and Annie.

“However you have come, you are welcome in my kingdom,” he said. He turned to the queen. “Guinevere, these are the two friends who once gave me hope and courage in a time of need.”

Queen Guinevere smiled again. But there was a sad look in her eyes. “I have heard much about you,” she said.

“I’ve heard about you, too!” said Annie.

“Allow me to present my knights,” said King Arthur. “Sir Bors, Sir Kay, Sir Tristram … ”

As the king named each knight, Jack and Annie nodded shyly. The knights nodded at them in return. Jack waited to hear the name Sir Lancelot, the most famous of Camelot’s knights. But the king never said it.

“And finally, Sir Bedivere and Sir Gawain,” King Arthur said.

The king then turned to three empty chairs at the table. “And there once sat three who are lost to us now,” he said.

Lost how? wondered Jack.

“You may sit at their places and join our dinner,” King Arthur said.

“Thank you,” said Annie.

Following Morgan around the table, Jack read the names carved on the backs of the three empty chairs: SIR LANCELOT, SIR GALAHAD, SIR PERCIVAL.

Jack took off his backpack and sat down in Sir Lancelot’s place.

As he sat tall and straight in the heavy wooden chair, Jack looked at the king and his knights. They were gnawing meat off bones and slurping wine from heavy goblets. They ate without manners or delight.

Jack really wanted to take notes. He reached into his pack under the table and pulled out his notebook and pencil. But before he could write a word, a serving boy brought more food. Jack quickly put his things away. The boy set a greasy slab of beef on a soggy piece of bread in front of him. The food looked terrible.

“Not much of a Christmas feast, huh?” Annie said in a low voice.

Jack shook his head.

Annie leaned close to Morgan and whispered so King Arthur wouldn’t hear. “What happened to the three lost knights?” she asked.

“After Mordred’s Dark Wizard cast his spell, the king sought help from the magicians of Camelot,” Morgan said quietly. “They told him he must send his knights on a quest to the Otherworld, to recapture our kingdom’s joy.”

“What’s the Otherworld?” said Jack.

“It is an ancient, enchanted land beyond the edge of the Earth,” said Morgan. “The place where all magic first began.”

“Wow,” whispered Annie.

“The king chose his three bravest knights to journey there,” said Morgan. “When they did not come back, Arthur turned against his magicians. He blamed magic for all of Camelot’s woes. Hence, he has banned magic of any kind from the kingdom forever.”

“But you’re a magician,” whispered Annie. “Did the king turn against you, too?”

“Arthur and I have a long friendship,” said Morgan. “He has allowed me to stay in the castle as long as I promise not to practice the art of magic ever again.”

A feeling of dread crept over Jack. “So … does that mean the magic tree house is … ?”

Morgan nodded. “Yes. Banished from Camelot,” she said. “I’m afraid this will be your last journey. And the last time we see each other.” Her eyes filled with tears. She looked away.

“What? The last time we see each other? Forever?” said Annie.

Before Morgan could answer, the wooden doors swung open with a bang. A wind rushed through the great hall. The torches and candles flamed brighter, making the shadows leap wildly on the walls.

The sound of hoofbeats filled the room. A knight on a huge horse rode through the arched doorway.

The knight was dressed all in red—from his shining helmet to the long cloak on his back. His horse was dressed all in green—from the armor that covered his head to the cloth that hung from his saddle.

“Oh, wow!” breathed Annie. “A Christmas Knight!”


4. Who Will Go?


“I have come to see Arthur the king!” the Christmas Knight said. His deep voice echoed from inside his helmet. His red armor gleamed in the firelight.

King Arthur stood up. He stared fiercely at the knight, but he spoke in a calm, steady voice. “I am Arthur the king,” he said. “Who are you?”

The knight did not answer Arthur’s question. “So. You are the legendary King Arthur of Camelot,” he said in a mocking voice. “And these must be the famous Knights of the Round Table.”



“Yes,” said King Arthur, “and again, I ask: Who are you?”

The Christmas Knight still did not answer Arthur’s question.

“The spell of the Dark Wizard has robbed Camelot of its joy,” said the Christmas Knight. “Has it robbed you and your men of your courage as well?”

“You dare to question our courage?” King Arthur said in a low, angry voice.



“CAMELOT IS DYING!” the Christmas Knight boomed. “Why has no one journeyed to the Otherworld to recapture its joy?”

“I have sent my best knights on such a quest,” said King Arthur. “They never returned.”

“THEN SEND MORE!” thundered the Christmas Knight.

“NO!” shouted King Arthur, pounding his fists on the table. “Never again will I feed good men to the magic and monsters of the Otherworld!”

Jack felt a chill of fear. What monsters?

“Then you choose your fate,” said the Christmas Knight. “If you will send no one else to the Otherworld, all that your kingdom has gained through time—all beauty, music, wonder, and light, all that Camelot has ever been or could ever be—will be lost and forgotten forever.”

“No!” shouted Annie.

“Shh, Annie!” said Jack.

The Christmas Knight turned to the knights at the table. “WHO WILL GO?” he boomed.

“We will!” shouted Annie.

“We will?” said Jack.

“Yes! We’ll go on the quest!” Annie yelled. She jumped up.

“No!” cried Morgan le Fay.

“Never!” said King Arthur.

“Annie!” said Jack. He leaped up from his chair and tried to grab her.

“YES!” thundered the Christmas Knight. He pointed his red-gloved hand at Annie and Jack. “The youngest of all—these two—they will go.”

“You are mocking us!” King Arthur shouted.

“THEY WILL GO!” boomed the knight. His words echoed throughout the hall.

Oh, no, thought Jack.

“Yes!” said Annie. She pulled Jack toward the Christmas Knight.

King Arthur turned to his men. “Stop them!”

Several knights started to rush toward Jack and Annie. The Christmas Knight raised his gloved hand high in the air.

In an instant, the room fell deathly quiet.

Everyone around the table was as still as a statue.

King Arthur looked like the statue of a furious king. Queen Guinevere looked like the statue of a worried queen. The Knights of the Round Table looked like statues of fierce knights.

And Morgan le Fay looked like the statue of a caring friend. Her mouth was open, as if she were calling out to Jack and Annie. But no sound came from her lips—no sound at all.


5. Rhymes of the Christmas Knight


“Morgan?” said Annie.

Annie ran to the table. She touched Morgan’s cheek, then quickly pulled back her hand.

“She’s cold. She’s as cold as ice!” said Annie. Tears filled her eyes.

Annie turned to the Christmas Knight in a fury. “What did you do to Morgan?” she asked. “Bring her back!”

“Do not fear,” said the Christmas Knight. His voice was softer and kinder. “She will come back to life after you complete your quest.”

“What—what exactly is our quest?” said Jack.

“You must journey to the Otherworld,” said the Christmas Knight. “There you will find a cauldron. The cauldron is filled with the Water of Memory and Imagination. You must bring a cup of the water back to Camelot. If you fail, Camelot will never come back to life. Never.”

“How do we do all that?” asked Annie, wiping her eyes.

“Remember these three rhymes,” said the Christmas Knight.

“Wait, let me write them down,” said Jack.

His hands trembled as he pulled out his notebook and pencil. He looked at the Christmas Knight.

“Okay, I’m ready,” he said. Gripping his pencil made Jack feel stronger.

The knight’s voice rang out from inside his helmet.

“Beyond the iron gate

The Keepers of the Cauldron wait.”

Jack quickly wrote down the knight’s words. “Okay, what’s next?” he asked.

The Christmas Knight went on:

“Four gifts you will need—

The first from me.

Then a cup, a compass,

And, finally, a key.”

“Cup … compass … key … . Got it,” said Jack.

The Christmas Knight’s voice boomed again:

“If you survive to complete your quest,

The secret door lies to the west.”

Jack copied down the last rhyme, then looked up at the knight.

“Anything else?” he asked.

Without a word, the knight pulled off his red cloak. He dropped it to the floor. It fell silently into a heap at Jack and Annie’s feet.

The Christmas Knight snapped his horse’s red reins, then galloped out of the great hall.


6. A White Comet


Once the knight was gone, the candles and torches in the great hall grew dimmer. A bitter chill crept over the room.

“What do these three rhymes mean?” said Jack, looking at his notebook. “Who are the Keepers of the Cauldron? What secret door?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “I just know we have to save Morgan.”

She gathered the red cloak up in her arms. “We’ve got our first gift,” she said. “Let’s go.”

“Wait—we should figure this out first,” said Jack.

“No. We should just go,” said Annie. She turned and headed for the archway.

Jack pushed his glasses into place and looked back at the Round Table, at the frozen king and queen, at the frozen knights, and at Morgan le Fay.

He loved Morgan. She was their great friend and teacher. If he and Annie did not go on their quest, Morgan’s story and the stories of Camelot and all the stories about the magic tree house would end forever.

Jack took a deep breath. He put his notebook into his backpack. Then he turned toward the archway.

“Annie?” he said.

She was gone.

“Annie, wait!” he shouted. “Wait!”

Jack ran out of the great hall.

“Annie!”

“I’m here,” she said quietly. “I’m waiting.” She was standing at the end of the entrance hall peering outside.

“How do we get to the Otherworld?” she asked.

“Maybe the tree house can take us there,” said Jack. “Come on.”

Together, Jack and Annie hurried through the inner courtyard of the castle and over the drawbridge. They ran over the frozen ground to the moonlit grove of trees.

Clutching the red cloak, Annie started up the rope ladder. Jack followed. They climbed inside the tree house and sat on the floor.

Annie picked up the Royal Invitation. “Close your eyes. I’ll make the wish,” she said.

Jack closed his eyes. He was shivering from the cold.

“I wish we could go to the Otherworld,” said Annie.

The bare branches of the trees rattled in the wind.

“I think it’s working!” whispered Annie.

The wind stopped blowing.

Jack opened his eyes. He and Annie looked out the window. The dark castle loomed against the sky. They were still in Camelot.

“It d-didn’t work,” said Jack, his teeth chattering.

“Yes, it did!” whispered Annie. “Look down.”

Standing below the tree house was the biggest deer Jack had ever seen. The deer was staring up at them with amber eyes. His huge antlers seemed to glow in the cold moonlight.

Most amazing of all, the deer was completely white, as white as new-fallen snow.

“A white stag!” said Jack.

Puffs of frosty air blew from the stag’s nostrils. He stepped toward the tree house and shook his giant head.

“He’s come to take us on our journey,” said Annie.

“People don’t ride deer,” said Jack.

But Annie had already started down the rope ladder. Jack watched from the window as she walked to the stag and spoke softly. The stag knelt. Annie climbed on his back.

“Come on!” she called to Jack. “Bring the cloak!”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He gathered up the heavy velvet cloak. Clutching it against his chest, he climbed down the rope ladder. He hurried over to Annie and the white stag.

“Put on the cloak and climb on behind me,” said Annie.

Jack put the cloak on over his backpack. He pulled it around his shoulders and buttoned it at the neck. As the cloak fell down around his body, the soft, smooth cloth made him feel warm and safe.

“Ready?” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He climbed on the stag’s back behind Annie.



The white stag slowly stood up. Annie leaned forward, putting her arms around its neck. Jack leaned forward, too, and held on to Annie. The red velvet cloak draped over both of them, falling past their feet.

The white stag stepped gracefully over the frozen grass. He walked through the outer gate of the castle. He blew out a puff of air, then broke into a leaping run.

Jack held on tightly to Annie as the stag dashed across a frost-covered field. He jumped over hedgerows and stone walls. He bounded across icy streams.

Annie’s braids floated on the wind. The red cloak billowed behind them. Jack was amazed at how easy it was to ride on the stag’s back. He felt calm and safe as the stag sped like a white comet through the wintry countryside.

The stag ran past flocks of sheep and herds of goats asleep in the meadows. He ran past thatched huts and quiet stables.

The stag ran on and on through the starry night. Jack saw a cloud-covered mountain range in the distance. When they came close to the craggy mountains, Jack was sure the stag would stop. But he galloped on—not even breaking his stride as he started up a rocky slope.

The stag finally came to a halt on the ledge of a steep cliff. In a windy swirl of fog and cloud, he knelt to the ground, and Jack and Annie slid off his back.

The stag stood up. He stared down at them with his glowing amber eyes.

“Thank you!” said Annie. “Do you have to leave now?”

The stag lowered his head and raised it again. He blew out a frosty puff of air, then leaped away, vanishing into the mist.

“Bye,” Annie said wistfully. She stared into the mist for a moment, then turned to Jack. “What do we do now?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Let’s read the three rhymes again.”

He reached under the red cloak and pulled off his pack. He took out his notebook and started to read the first rhyme:

“Beyond the iron gate—”

“Jack!” interrupted Annie. “Look!”

Jack looked up. The wind had blown away some of the fog. Beyond the cliff rose another mountain. A huge gate was built into its side. A pale light shone between the gate’s thick iron bars. Two knights in gold armor stood guard under flaming torches.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

“That’s it—the iron gate!” said Annie. “If we pass through that gate, we’ll be in the Otherworld!”



7. A Good Trick

As the wind blew away more fog, Jack and Annie saw a bridge. It was made of thick wooden planks held together with iron bands. It stretched all the way from the edge of the cliff where they were standing to the iron gate.

“Come on, let’s go!” said Annie.

“Wait!” said Jack. “What about the guards?”

The two guards in gold armor stood perfectly still. Their huge spears gleamed in the torchlight.



“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Read the second rhyme.”

Jack looked in his notebook and read aloud.

“Four gifts you will need—

The first from me.

Then a cup, a compass,

And, finally, a key.”

“The first gift is the Christmas Knight’s cloak,” said Annie.

“Yeah, I guess it’s supposed to help us somehow,” said Jack.

He unbuttoned the cloak from around his neck. Then he held it out to get a good look at it.

“Maybe it can make us invisible,” said Annie.

“That’s nuts,” said Jack.

“Seriously,” she said, “cloaks sometimes do that in stories.”

“Well, it didn’t make me invisible, did it?” said Jack.

“Maybe you were wearing it wrong,” said Annie. “Give it to me.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. But he handed the cloak to Annie. It flapped in the wind as she pulled it around her shoulders.

“Can you see me?” she said.

“Yes, Annie,” said Jack, rolling his eyes. “I can see you.”

Jack looked back at the gate. Even if we get past the guards, what then? he wondered. The Otherworld swallowed up Camelot’s best knights. King Arthur said it was filled with magic and monsters.

“Jack! Look at me now.”

Jack turned to Annie. She wasn’t there.

“Where are you?” he said, staring at the darkness.

“Cool, it works!”

“Where are you?” Jack said again, turning around.

“Here.”

Jack felt a hand touch his face.

“Ahh!” he said, jumping back.

“It’s me! I’m invisible! I pulled the hood over my head. That’s the trick.”

Jack felt a chill run down his spine.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

“Watch. I’m going to take the hood off.”

In a flash, Annie was back.

“It feels creepy to be invisible,” she said.

Jack was speechless.

“The magic only happens when you wear the hood,” said Annie. “Good trick, huh?”

“Uh—yeah,” said Jack. He shook his head. “This is just too weird.”

“Don’t worry about it being weird. It’s a great way to get past the guards,” said Annie. “Plus it’s a way to hide in the Otherworld. We don’t know what we’ll find there, right?”

“Yeah, right,” said Jack. “Okay.”

“Good,” said Annie. “Now, stand beside me and don’t move.”

Jack put away his notebook. Annie threw the velvet cloak over his shoulders and backpack.

“Great. It’s big enough for both of us,” she said. She carefully arranged the folds around them. Then she pulled the huge hood over both their heads.

Jack looked down. He couldn’t see his body at all! He felt like he couldn’t breathe. In a panic, he threw off the hood.

“I hate that!” he said.

“I told you it’s creepy,” said Annie. “But if we don’t wear it, we won’t get past the guards.”

“Yeah, I know, and we won’t have protection in the Otherworld,” said Jack. He took a deep breath. “Okay. Let’s do it.”

Annie pulled the hood up again.

“I’ll hold on to the hood so it won’t blow off,” she said. “You just think about getting across that bridge. Nothing else.”

“But I can’t see my feet,” said Jack.

“You don’t need to see your feet to walk!” said Annie. “Come on. Do it for Morgan!”

“Right,” said Jack.

He and Annie stepped onto the bridge.

“Whatever you do, don’t look down,” said Annie.

As they started over the bridge, the wind whistled around them. Jack couldn’t help it—he looked down.

Not only was his body missing, but the fog beneath the bridge was moving in a wild, spinning whirl. Jack felt dizzy and faint. He stopped.

“Keep going,” whispered Annie.

Jack took a deep breath and looked straight ahead. Then he started walking again. He went slowly—step by step—toward the pale light beyond the bars of the gate.

In the flickering torchlight, the guards looked like giants. As Jack and Annie slipped invisibly by them, Jack held his breath.

How will we open the gate? he wondered.

“WHOOOSSSHHH!” said Annie loudly.

Jack’s heart nearly stopped. Had Annie lost her mind? “What are you doing?” he whispered.

“I’m the wind!” Annie whispered back. “WHOOOSSSHHH!”

Annie gave the gate a shove. It swung open, as if pushed by the wind.

Jack looked back and saw that the guards had turned in their direction.

“Quick!” whispered Annie.

She and Jack moved silently through the gateway.

“WHOOOSSSHHH!” said Annie.

She pushed the gate back. It shut with a clang. Through the bars, Jack saw the guards face the bridge again.

“Good work,” he said to Annie.

“Thanks,” she said.

Jack and Annie then turned away from the gate.

“Ohh!” whispered Annie.

“The Otherworld,” whispered Jack.



8. The Otherworld

The Otherworld was completely different from the dark, cold world Jack and Annie had just left behind.

They were standing at the edge of a pale green meadow. The meadow was bathed in warm, rosy sunlight. Three horses—one black, one brown, one gray—were grazing nearby. On a hillside beyond the meadow, red and purple flowers sparkled like bright buttons.

“It’s so nice here,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Maybe we won’t need this anymore.” He pulled the hood of the cloak off their heads. He was relieved to see Annie’s face—and to see himself!

“What was the first rhyme again?” asked Annie.

Jack took out his notebook. He found the first rhyme and read aloud:

“Beyond the iron gate

The Keepers of the Cauldron wait.”

He looked around warily. “I wonder where the Keepers of the Cauldron are?” he said.

“What do you mean?” asked Annie. “We just sneaked past them. Remember? WHOOOSH?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “The rhyme says ‘beyond the iron gate.’ Those guards were standing in front of the gate. They weren’t beyond it.”

“Shh,” said Annie. “Listen.… ”

From over the hill came the faint sounds of sweet, joyful music.

“Maybe the Keepers of the Cauldron are playing that music,” said Annie.

“Maybe … ,” said Jack. He listened for a moment and smiled. The music made him feel light and happy.

“Let’s go meet the Keepers!” said Annie.

“Not so fast,” said Jack. “Shouldn’t we be invisible again? Just in case?”

“I guess so,” said Annie, sighing.

Jack pulled the hood of the cloak over their heads. Together, they started walking invisibly across the soft meadow. They passed the three horses and climbed the flower-covered hill. At the top, they looked down.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

The hill sloped gently down into a misty green glade. In the middle of the glade, a band of musicians played flutes and pipes, drums and violins. Around the band, hundreds of dancers danced in a huge circle.

“The Keepers of the Cauldron!” said Annie.

The dancers and musicians were smiling and laughing. They wore blue coats and green coats, white gowns and yellow gowns. They wore sparkling red slippers and hats with colored feathers.

The dancers looked like people—except they all had glittering gold skin and wings that shimmered in the mist like spun silver.

“They’re beautiful!” said Annie.

“Yeah, they are,” said Jack.

“I don’t think we need to be invisible with them,” said Annie.

“I think you’re right,” said Jack.

He and Annie threw off the red cloak. They left it in the dewy grass and ran down the hillside to the winged dancers. The dancers paid no attention to them. They just kept going around and around in their joyous circle.

“I feel like dancing with them!” said Annie.

“Me too!” said Jack. It was strange—he was usually shy about dancing. But he wanted to join this dance more than anything.

Jack pulled off his backpack. As he set it down, he saw three swords lying in the grass. But he didn’t stop to wonder about them. The music was calling.

The winged dancers broke their circle and welcomed Jack and Annie into their dance. Annie held Jack’s right hand as he grasped the slender golden hand of the dancer on his left.

The dancer smiled down at him. Like the others, she was as tall as a grownup. But she didn’t have any lines or wrinkles on her face. All the dancers looked very young—yet they seemed ancient at the same time.

As Jack danced around in the circle, his heart leaped. His spirits soared. His glasses fell off, but he didn’t care. He kept dancing. As he danced, everything in his mind became a blur. He forgot about Morgan and Camelot. He forgot about the quest for the Water of Memory and Imagination. He forgot all his fears and worries.

“Jack, look!” Annie cried.

Jack looked at her. “Hi!” he shouted, laughing.

“No! Don’t look at me!” she called. “Look there! Look across the circle!”

“I can’t see!” he said.

“Three knights!” Annie shouted. “Three knights dancing!”



“Great!” Jack shouted.

“No, Jack! They look awful! They look sick!” Annie yelled. She pulled away from the circle and tumbled back into the grass.

“Jack!” she called. “Stop dancing!”

But Jack didn’t want to stop. He wanted to dance to the wild music forever. Forever … and ever … and ever.



9. The Lost Knights

Annie chased Jack around the circle.

“Stop, Jack!” she cried. “Stop!” She grabbed his shirt and tried to pull him out of the dance.

“Let go, Annie!” he said. “Leave me alone!”

But Annie wouldn’t let go. Finally, she pulled so hard that Jack broke hands with the dancers and tumbled backward into the grass.

The winged dancers didn’t seem to notice. They closed their circle and kept going around and around.

“Why did you do that?” said Jack, sitting up. “I was having fun!”

“Look at the knights!” said Annie. “See them?”

Jack still couldn’t see. The world was spinning before his eyes. He ached to get back into the dance.

“Here, I found your glasses!” said Annie. “Put them on!”

Jack put on his glasses. He peered at the circle of dancers. He caught sight of armor glinting in the sunlight. He saw three knights dancing in a row. Two of them looked very young. The third looked much older.

As they came closer, Jack saw their faces. All the joy of the music drained out of him. The knights looked tired and sick. Their hair and beards were long and scraggly. Their faces were bony and pale. Their eyes stared wildly and their lips were frozen in ghostly smiles.

“What’s wrong with them?” asked Jack.

“They can’t stop dancing!” said Annie. “They’re dancing themselves to death!”

“They must be the lost knights from Camelot,” said Jack.

“We have to save them!” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He tried to clear his mind and think. “What about this? We get back in the dance—and we take places between the dancers and the knights.”

“Yes! Then we can pull the knights out of the circle!” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack. “What if I can’t stop dancing again?”

“Just don’t let yourself get caught by the music,” said Annie. “You have to think about something else. Think about why we’re here. Think about Morgan.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “I’ll try.”

Jack and Annie crouched in the grass. They watched and waited as the knights danced closer … and closer … and closer.…

“Now!” shouted Annie.

Jack and Annie rushed forward. They broke into the circle on either side of the knights. As Jack started dancing, his feet seemed to fly to the beat of the drum. He felt a wave of great joy. His worries left him.

“Now, Jack!” cried Annie. “Pull away!”

But Jack didn’t want to pull away. The music rang in his ears. Nothing mattered except the dancing.

“Jack! Pull away NOW!” Annie shouted again.

Jack shook his head, trying to shake off Annie’s voice.

“Morgan! Morgan!” Annie yelled.

The word Morgan made Jack stumble a bit in the dance.

“Morgan! Morgan!” Annie shouted.

Jack stumbled again. Then he used all his might to stop himself from dancing. He let go of the hand of the dancer on his right and threw himself out of the dance—pulling the knight on his left with him. Annie and the other two knights tumbled back with them onto the grass.

Just as before, the dancers didn’t seem to notice. They closed their circle and kept going round and round in their joyous, timeless dance.



10. The Knights’ Gifts

The three knights lay in the grass, fighting for breath.

“The dance … We must stop … stop dancing,” gasped the older knight.

“You have stopped! We pulled you away!” said Annie.

The knight looked up at her and Jack. He had a rough, craggy face.

“Who … who are you?” he asked in a hoarse voice.

“Friends!” said Annie. She spoke loudly to be heard over the music. “We come from King Arthur’s castle!”

“We’re on a quest,” said Jack, “to get the Water of Memory and Imagination.”

“To save Camelot!” said Annie.

“Camelot—” whispered the knight. “We come from Camelot …. I don’t recognize you ….”

“We’re just visiting,” said Annie. “But we know all about you. You’re Sir Lancelot, aren’t you?”

“Yes,” breathed the knight.

“And Sir Percival and Sir Galahad,” said Jack.

“Yes … my son, Galahad … ,” said the knight.

“King Arthur thinks you are lost forever,” said Annie.

Sir Lancelot closed his eyes. “The dance … ,” he said, “it made us forget.… ”

“I know,” said Jack. “The dancers must be the Keepers of the Cauldron. You can’t get past them without getting caught up in their dance.”

“Father … we must find … the water.… ” Sir Galahad tried to sit up, but he was too weary. He lay back in the grass.

“That’s okay, we’re here now,” said Annie. “You should all rest.”

Sir Galahad closed his eyes.

“Yeah, don’t worry,” said Jack. “Annie and I will find the magic water for Camelot.”

“But you … you are just children,” said Sir Percival, the third knight. “You must wait … for us.… ”

“There’s no time to wait,” said Jack.

“Camelot is dying!” said Annie. “We have to hurry!”

“Then you must … take this … ,” said Sir Galahad. He reached into a leather pouch that hung around his shoulder. He took out a silver cup. With a trembling hand, the young knight gave the cup to Annie.

“A cup!” she said.

“Take … this, too,” said Sir Percival. He pulled a small wooden box from a bag that hung from his belt. He handed it to Jack.

Jack opened the lid. In the middle of the box was a pointer with markings all around it.

“A compass!” said Jack.

“And this … ,” said Sir Lancelot. He took a silk cord from around his neck. A glass key hung from the cord.

“A key!” whispered Annie.



Lancelot handed the key to Annie. She and Jack looked at it closely. Then Annie hung it around her neck. When she turned back, all the knights were fast asleep.

“Sweet dreams,” Annie said gently. “You guys need a long nap.”

Jack and Annie stood up.

“I think we have all our gifts now,” Jack said. “But I’d better make sure.”

He hurried to get his backpack. It was lying in the grass near the knights’ swords. He pulled out his notebook and read the second rhyme:

“Four gifts you will need—

The first from me.

Then a cup, a compass,

And, finally, a key.”

“Great,” said Annie. “We got the cloak from the Christmas Knight and the other three gifts from them. This quest is really easy.”

Jack shook his head.

“It’s not over yet,” he said. “We still have to find the cauldron with the Water of Memory and Imagination.”

“We’ll find it,” said Annie. “Read the third rhyme.”

Jack looked in his notebook and read the third rhyme aloud:

“If you survive to complete your quest,

The secret door lies to the west.”

“No problem!” said Annie. “We survived the guards and the dance. Now the compass can show us how to go west. And the key will unlock the secret door. And we’ll fill the cup with water from the cauldron! See, it’s all easy!”

Jack still felt worried. A little too easy, he thought.

“What are we waiting for?” said Annie. “Let’s go.”

Jack looked down at the compass. “Okay … ,” he said. “The pointer’s pointing north. So west must be that way.” He pointed left, toward a thicket of bushes and small trees.

“Great,” said Annie. “Here, carry the cup in your pack.”

Jack put his notebook and the silver cup into his pack. Then he and Annie started into the thicket.

They ducked under branches and pushed past bushes. Thorns scraped their hands. Twigs snapped against their faces.

Jack kept checking the compass. Could they really be searching in the right place? he wondered. What kind of door would they find in a tangled thicket?

“Listen,” said Annie. “It’s so quiet now.”

The thicket had grown eerily silent. No birds called from the bushes. No music could be heard in the distance.

Jack checked the compass once more. “It says we’re still going west,” he said. “I just hope this thing works.”

“It works,” Annie said softly. “Look—” Annie was holding back a leafy branch. She pointed to a rocky hillside beyond the thicket. Halfway up the hillside was a ledge.

Between two giant boulders on the ledge was a shining glass door.


11. The Crystal Cave


“The secret door!” whispered Jack.

“Yes!” said Annie.

Jack dropped the compass into his pack. Then he and Annie scrambled through the bushes and climbed up the rocks to the door.

Annie took Sir Lancelot’s glass key from around her neck. She slipped the key into the keyhole. She turned the key slowly.

Clink.

“Yippee,” Annie said softly. She pushed open the door.

Beyond the door was a huge, glittering cave. The floor, walls, and ceiling were made of clear crystal.

Jack and Annie stepped inside. The cave was filled with dancing streams of purple light.

“It’s so bright!” whispered Jack. “Where’s all the purple light coming from?”

“There,” said Annie. She pointed to a crack on the far side of the cave. “Let’s look.”

They crossed the cave and peered through the crack into a room. Along the brilliant crystal walls of the room were four doorways.

In the far corner of the room was a fire. The fire blazed with leaping purple flames. Over the flames hung a gleaming golden cauldron.

“There it is,” whispered Jack.

“Wow,” whispered Annie.

“The cauldron with the Water of Memory and Imagination,” whispered Jack.

“I know,” whispered Annie. “Let’s go!”

They squeezed through the crack, then walked toward the gleaming cauldron. Jack reached into his pack and pulled out Sir Galahad’s silver cup.

“The cauldron’s too high,” said Annie. “We can’t get to the water.”

“Here, take this,” said Jack, handing her the cup. “Climb on my back.”

He bent over, and Annie climbed on piggyback. Jack stood up shakily. “Hurry!” he said. “You’re heavy.”

“I can’t reach it,” said Annie. “Move closer.”

Jack staggered forward a few steps. Stretching as far as she could, Annie reached again. She skimmed water from the top of the bubbling cauldron, filling the silver cup.

“Got it!” she whispered. “Now set me down. Slowly!”

Annie held the cup with both hands. Jack slowly bent his knees and Annie climbed carefully off his back. They stared silently for a moment at the Water of Memory and Imagination in the cup. It was clear and shimmering.

“Now we can save Morgan,” said Annie.

Just then Jack smelled something strange—it was like the smell of rotten seaweed. He heard weird gurgling sounds behind them.

He and Annie turned around.

A giant, slimy, mud-colored creature crawled out through one of the doorways. The creature was long and scaly like a crocodile but much, MUCH bigger. It had wings that looked as if they’d been spun from a thousand spiderwebs. It had glowing red eyes and long, curled claws.



The creature opened its huge jaws. Strands of drool dripped from its sharp, pointed teeth. The creature hissed and hot blue flame shot from its mouth.

Another monster crawled through a different doorway, quickly followed by a third, and then a fourth.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“The real Keepers of the Cauldron … ,” whispered Jack.



12. Fire with Fire

The four real Keepers of the Cauldron crawled closer to Jack and Annie, hissing and snorting blue fire.

“What do we do now?” whispered Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “We’re trapped.”

“I have an idea,” whispered Annie. “Let’s drink the water.”

“What?” said Jack.

“It’s the Water of Memory and Imagination, right?” said Annie. “So maybe if we drink it, we can imagine a way to escape!”

“That’s crazy,” said Jack.

The Keepers crawled closer, snorting more blue flame and filling the air with their rotten stench.

“Okay, okay, let’s try it,” said Jack.

Annie took a sip from the silver cup, then handed it to Jack. His hands trembled as he held the cup to his lips and took a sip. The water tasted sweet, bitter, and spicy, all at the same time.

Jack gave the cup back to Annie.

“Now imagine we’re saved!” she said.

Jack closed his eyes. He tried to imagine being saved. He pictured the four Keepers crawling back through their doorways.

“Okay. Ready to fight?” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. “What? Fight?”

Annie set the silver cup on the floor.

“Now!” she said.

Suddenly, Jack felt like he’d been hit by a bolt of lightning. His fears slipped away. He was filled with strength and fury.

Without thinking, he lunged with Annie toward the wood fire under the cauldron. They each grabbed two long, straight branches from the edge of the fire. They raised them high in the air. The branches blazed with purple fire like flaming swords.



“AAAHHH!” Jack and Annie shouted.

The four Keepers hissed louder than before. Great balls of blue fire exploded from their mouths and nostrils!

Jack and Annie slashed the air with their fiery weapons, jabbing at the Keepers. They fought fire with fire, blue flame with purple flame.

“Back! Back!” they shouted.

With each jab and shout, Jack felt stronger and braver. Waving their burning branches, he and Annie drove the Keepers toward the walls.

The Keepers’ blue flames grew weaker and weaker, as if they were running out of fuel. Finally, one by one, each Keeper slunk back into the doorway from which it had come.

When all the Keepers had disappeared, Jack and Annie placed a burning branch in front of each of the four doorways to keep the monsters from coming back out.

Then they brushed off their hands.

“Let’s go,” Annie said coolly.

Jack nodded.

Annie carefully picked up the silver cup of water from the cauldron. Then she and Jack squeezed through the narrow crack and strode through the bright crystal cave.

They stepped out into the daylight.

The glass key was still in the keyhole.

Jack calmly locked the door behind them. He handed the key to Annie.

Then Jack’s knees gave way, and he sank to the ground.



13. Your Horses Are Waiting

“I don’t believe what just happened,” said Jack.

“What part don’t you believe?” said Annie, holding the silver cup.

Jack laughed and shook his head.

“I don’t believe any of it,” he said.

Annie laughed, too. “That was cool, huh?”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and stared at her. “Seriously, what just happened in there?” he asked.

“I imagined us fighting the Keepers with flaming swords,” said Annie. “What did you imagine?”

Jack shrugged. “I—I just imagined the Keepers going back in their holes,” he said.

“Good,” said Annie. “We both got what we imagined.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, smiling. “But what you imagined made a much better story.”

A shriek of fury came from inside the cave.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Let’s get out of here!” said Jack.

He scrambled to his feet, and together they climbed back down over the big rocks to the thicket. Annie moved very carefully to keep from spilling the water in the cup.

When they came to the thicket, Jack pulled out Sir Percival’s compass. “If we came west to get here, we have to go east to get back,” he said. “East is that way.… ”

As they started into the wild growth, Jack went first so he could clear the way for Annie. Without talking, they pushed steadily through the trees and bushes, moving farther and farther from the Keepers’ cave.

Finally, they heard music in the distance. They walked closer and closer toward the sound, until they stepped back into the green glade.

The winged dancers were still there, dancing in their magic circle. Jack’s heart raced. He wanted to join them again. But he knew that if he did, he would never escape their dance.

“Look!” said Annie. “The knights are awake!”

Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir Percival were standing just beyond the circle of dancers. They were buckling on their swords.

“Hi!” called Annie. “Guess what! We got it!”

The knights walked shakily toward Jack and Annie. They still looked thin and tired, but color had returned to their cheeks.

“We have the Water of Memory and Imagination,” said Annie. She held up the silver cup.

The knights smiled.

“Now we just have to get it back to Camelot,” said Jack.

“We would like to help you,” said Sir Lancelot. “But it seems we have lost our three horses.”

“No, you haven’t!” said Annie. “Your horses are waiting for you!”

“They’re on the other side of the hill,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie led the knights over the hill. On their way, Jack picked up the red velvet cloak. When they came to the meadow, they saw the three horses.

The horses neighed and cantered over to the knights. As Sir Lancelot stroked the mane of the black horse, he turned to Jack and Annie.

“You can both ride back to Camelot with me,” he said.

“Thanks!” they said.

Jack fastened the red cloak around his neck. Sir Lancelot helped them onto the back of his horse, then climbed on himself.

Annie sat behind Lancelot. She held on to the knight with her right hand. She held the silver cup in her left hand.

“Can you carry the water without spilling it?” Jack asked her, worried.

“I’ll try,” she said.

Sir Galahad mounted the brown horse, and Sir Percival climbed on the gray horse. Then the three knights started through the pale green meadow.

“Careful, careful,” Jack whispered to Annie.

“I got it, I got it,” she said.

When they came to the iron gate, the knights drew their swords.

“Open the gate! In the name of King Arthur of Camelot!” Sir Lancelot called. Though he still sounded hoarse, the knight’s deep voice carried an amazing strength.



The iron gate slowly swung open. Sir Lancelot urged his horse onward.

The guards watched silently as the knights passed by them and started across the bridge.

The three horses trod in single file over the wooden planks. Again, Jack was amazed by the difference between this world and the Otherworld. Here it was dark and freezing and foggy. The red cloak flapped in the bitter wind.

As the horses stepped off the bridge, they each neighed loudly.

“Oh, wow!” whispered Annie.

Standing high on a rock, in a swirl of fog, was the white stag.


14. Return


The three knights gazed in wonder at the white stag.

“Here, take this!” Annie said to Jack. She handed him the silver cup. Then she slipped off the back of Lancelot’s horse and ran to the stag.

“Thanks for coming for us!” she cried, throwing her arms around his neck.

The three knights looked at Jack.

“That’s the white stag,” said Jack. “He brought us here.”

“Are you wizards?” Sir Percival asked in a hushed voice.

“No, just ordinary kids,” said Jack. “But I know he’s magic. We got here from Camelot in no time at all. I guess he’s come to take us back.”

“Then you must go with him,” said Sir Lancelot. “You will have a much faster journey, I can assure you.”

Sir Lancelot held the silver cup as Jack slipped down from the black horse. Then Jack took the cup and carefully climbed onto the back of the stag behind Annie. He held the cup with both hands as the stag stood up.

“Tell King Arthur we will return to Camelot before the first night of the New Year,” said Sir Lancelot.

“Farewell, Jack and Annie!” said Sir Galahad.

“Godspeed!” said Sir Percival.

“Same to you!” said Annie.

“Have a safe trip!” said Jack.

The knights solemnly bowed.

The white stag blew out a puff of frosty air. Then he started down the mountainside.

When the stag came to the base of the mountain, he took off again like a white comet. The red cloak billowed around Jack and Annie, keeping them warm and safe.

The stag dashed across the wintry fields. He ran past quiet stables and thatched huts. He ran past flocks of sheep and herds of goats asleep in meadows. He leaped over frozen streams and stone walls and hedgerows.

The stag ran on and on through the starry night, until he brought Jack and Annie back to the dark castle grounds of Camelot.

He walked over the frozen grass of the outer courtyard. He came to a halt near the grove below the tree house. He knelt in the grass, and Jack and Annie climbed off his back.

Miraculously, the silver cup still brimmed with water from the cauldron. Not a drop had spilled out.

“We’d better leave the cloak here,” said Jack, “so I don’t trip on it.”

Jack carefully set the cup on the ground. Annie helped him unbutton the red velvet cloak from around his neck. Then she draped it over the stag’s back.

“To keep you warm and safe,” she whispered to him. “And thanks for everything.”

“Yeah, thanks,” said Jack. “Good-bye.”

The white stag stared at them with his mysterious amber eyes. He nodded once. Then he turned and headed into the darkness.

Jack picked up the cup. “Come on!” he said. He started walking quickly through the outer courtyard.

“Careful, careful!” said Annie.

“I got it, I got it,” said Jack.

They crossed the drawbridge to the inner courtyard of the castle. Then they pushed open the giant arched doors.

The great hall was just as they had left it—dimly lit and freezing cold. King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, the Knights of the Round Table, and Morgan le Fay were all still frozen and silent.

“What do we do now?” said Jack.

“Let’s try putting a drop of water on each of them! Morgan first!” said Annie.

“Okay,” said Jack. “Come on.”



Holding his breath and keeping his eyes on the cup, Jack walked carefully toward the Round Table. Suddenly, his left foot stepped on the shoelace of his right sneaker—and he stumbled.

“Jack!” yelled Annie.

Jack tried to regain his balance, but it was too late! As he fell to the floor, the silver cup slipped from his hands.


15. Christmas Magic


Jack and Annie watched in horror as the water from the cup splashed over the stone floor. It trickled into the cracks between the stones and disappeared.

Jack scrambled to the cup. He picked it up. It was completely empty.

“Oh, no,” Jack moaned. He sat back and put his head in his hands. Camelot will never wake up now, he thought. The legend will end forever.

“Jack!” said Annie. “Look!”

Jack raised his head. He pushed his glasses into place. A golden cloud was rising from the cracks between all the stones of the floor.

The cloud spread quickly throughout the great hall, filling the room with wonderful smells—the scent of cedar smoke and evergreen, of roses and almonds.

The cloud rose up and up, then wafted out through the upper windows of the hall. Suddenly, a white dove flew through one of the windows. It soared across the dark room like a bright light, then swooped back out into the night.

Soft, gentle laughter came from the end of the hall. The laughter grew louder. Jack saw King Arthur and Queen Guinevere looking at one another—they were laughing! The Knights of the Round Table were laughing, too!

Best of all, Jack saw Morgan le Fay smiling at him and Annie!

“Jack! Annie! Come here!” she called. She held out her arms.

“Morgan!” cried Annie. She ran to Morgan and threw her arms around the enchantress. Jack stood up. Still holding the empty cup, he ran to Morgan and hugged her, too.

“We did what the Christmas Knight told us to do!” said Annie. “We brought back the Water of Memory and Imagination!”

“But I dropped the cup,” said Jack, “and spilled all the water!”

“But the water made a gold cloud,” said Annie. “And everyone came back to life!”

Morgan laughed with amazement.

“You have just returned from the Otherworld?” she asked.

“Yes!” said Annie.

“A white stag brought us back!” said Jack. He turned to King Arthur.

“Your Majesty,” he said, “we have good news. Your knights are safe. Sir Lancelot said to tell you they’ll be home before the first night of the New Year.”

The king looked bewildered. “You found them—?”

“Yes, and they’re all fine,” said Annie.

“Here—” said Jack. He handed the silver cup to the king. “Please give this back to Sir Galahad.”

“And this to Sir Lancelot,” said Annie. She took the glass key from around her neck and gave it to King Arthur.

“Oh, and this to Sir Percival,” said Jack. He pulled the wooden compass box from his pack and gave it to the king.

At first, King Arthur was too stunned to speak. Then he clapped his hands and laughed joyfully.

“Thank you!” he said to Jack and Annie.

The Knights of the Round Table all cheered.

“Ring the bells!” King Arthur shouted. “Call the people of Camelot to the castle!”

“They have already gathered outside the doors, Your Majesty,” said a page.

“Bring them in!” said King Arthur. “We must rejoice together!”

Queen Guinevere smiled at Jack and Annie. Her eyes sparkled now. “Once again, you have helped save Camelot,” she said. “Thank you very much.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack and Annie together.

Then Jack heard the sounds of children talking and laughing. He turned to see a crowd of people streaming through the arched doorway of the great hall. They carried candles, a giant fir tree, and boughs of holly and pine. Musicians followed them with stringed instruments.

As everyone started to decorate the hall, the musicians began playing and singing a beautiful Christmas carol.

“Jack!” said Annie. “Look!”

The white stag was standing in the arched doorway.

Jack turned excitedly to Morgan. “See that white stag?” he said. “He took us to the Otherworld! See him?”

Morgan smiled.

“Yes, I do see him,” she said. “And now I see everything.”

Jack looked back at the doorway. The stag was gone. In his place stood an old man with a long white beard. He held a staff and wore a flowing red cloak—the same cloak Jack and Annie had worn on their quest.



“Who’s that?” Jack asked.

“That is Merlin the magician,” said Morgan. “It was Merlin who invited you here. I see that now.”

“Merlin?” said Jack. “He sent us the Royal Invitation?”

“Yes,” said Morgan. “Then he put the rest of us under a spell. And he carried you to the Otherworld.”

“No,” said Annie, “the Christmas Knight put you under a spell.”

“And the white stag carried us to the Otherworld,” said Jack.

Morgan smiled.

“Merlin was both the Christmas Knight and the white stag,” she said. “Remember, he’s a magician, not a mortal. He can change his shape whenever he wishes.”

“Oh, wow,” whispered Annie.

“Why did Merlin do these things?” asked Jack.

“Merlin was angry when King Arthur banished magic from Camelot,” said Morgan. “I see now he finally took matters into his own hands.”

“How?” said Jack.

“He knew King Arthur would send no more knights to the Otherworld for the Water of Memory and Imagination,” said Morgan. “So I assume he brought you to Camelot hoping that you would offer to go instead.”

“Why did he want us to go?” asked Annie.

“Merlin has often heard my tales of your adventures in the tree house,” said Morgan. “He knows you both have a great desire to fight for the good. And he knows you use the gift of imagination very well. Those are two special qualities needed to succeed in any quest.”

Jack and Annie looked back at Merlin. From far across the room, the white-bearded magician smiled at them. He raised his staff. Then he slipped out the door.

Jack looked around the great hall. All the candles and torches were lit now. A fire blazed in the hearth. The musicians were playing. Everyone was singing. The room glowed with warm firelight and rosy faces.

At last, Christmas in Camelot was just as Jack had imagined it would be. The spell of the Dark Wizard had been broken. The great hall was filled with beauty and love and joy and light.



16. Welcome Home

“Wake up, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

He was lying in the dark on the wooden floor of the tree house. Through the window, he saw the cloudy sky above the Frog Creek woods.

“Time to go home,” said Annie.

“Oh, I must have fallen asleep,” said Jack. “I had the most incredible dream. I dreamed that we went to Camelot. It was Christmas, and Merlin—”

“That wasn’t a dream,” said Annie. “It was real. You fell asleep at the Round Table during the party. King Arthur carried you to the tree house. And I made the wish for us to come home.”

Jack sat up.

“Seriously?” he whispered.

“Seriously,” she said.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” their mom called in the distance.

“Coming!” Annie shouted out the tree house window. She turned to Jack. “Let’s go!”

“I mean—seriously? It really happened?” Jack asked Annie again.

“Yes! Really!” she said. She held up the Royal Invitation. “See? Proof.”

“Oh … yeah,” he whispered.

“This time, the letter M stood for Merlin, not Morgan,” said Annie.

Jack smiled.

“Thanks, Merlin,” he said softly.

Jack picked up his backpack. Then he and Annie started down the rope ladder and headed home. As they walked through the deep December twilight, snowflakes started to fall.

By the time they left the woods and headed down their street, snow was swirling everywhere. Ahead they could see their house glowing with lamplight. Their mom was waiting on their front porch.

“Hi, Mom!” said Annie.

“Hi, Mom!” said Jack.

“Hi, kids. Did you have a good day?” she asked.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“Pretty good,” said Annie.

“I’m glad,” said their mom. “Welcome home.” She held the door open, and Jack and Annie slipped inside.

Their house felt extra warm and cozy. Good smells came from the kitchen. Jack and Annie took off their snow-covered jackets, then headed up the stairs.

In the hallway, Annie turned to Jack. “Merry Christmas,” she said simply.

“Merry Christmas,” he said.

Annie slipped into her room, and Jack into his.

Jack closed his door and sat on his bed. He took his notebook out of his pack and opened it. His spirits sank. Except for the three rhymes, he’d taken no notes on their journey—not one.

Exhausted, Jack lay back on his bed. He squeezed his eyes shut. He tried to remember the details of their adventures in Camelot and the Otherworld.

He could feel the terrible chill in the great hall when Morgan was frozen. He could hear the joyful music as the winged dancers danced around in their circle. He could taste the sweet, bitter, spicy taste of the Water of Memory and Imagination.

Jack sat up. All at once, he felt very awake. He turned to a clean page in his notebook. He grabbed his pencil and wrote:





Using his memory and his imagination, Jack kept writing, doing his part to keep the legend of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, Merlin, and Morgan le Fay alive.

As the snow swirled outside his window, Jack wrote and wrote and wrote. He didn’t stop writing until he had written down the whole story—his story of their Christmas in Camelot.


A Note from the Author


Many people believe that the legend of King Arthur was inspired by an actual military leader who led Britain over 1,500 years ago.

Imaginary stories about the adventures of King Arthur were first told in Wales and Ireland. These stories are called Celtic myths. Sadly, most Celtic myths are lost to us forever because only a few were written down. Many details in my story about King Arthur’s realm are drawn from details in the few Celtic stories that have survived through the ages.

The cloak that makes one invisible was considered to be one of “the Thirteen Treasures of Britain.” Merlin the magician was said to keep the treasures in a glass tower. None of the magic of the treasures would work for a person who was unworthy to use them.

The white stag was inspired by a supernatural Celtic beast that often led humans to a hidden Otherworld.

The idea for the Cauldron of Memory and Imagination came from a 6th-century poem. The poem tells a story about King Arthur and his knights traveling to a hidden world and searching for a magical cauldron of poetry and inspiration. Many knights never returned from that dangerous quest.

In the 12th century, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine encouraged poets and troubadours to make up more stories about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to inspire her people. In the following years, storytellers all over Europe told heroic tales of King Arthur, Merlin, Sir Lancelot, Queen Guinevere, and Morgan le Fay. French poets were the first to call the imaginary kingdom Camelot.

The storytellers of the Middle Ages blended elements of Christianity with the old Celtic myths. In their stories, miracles and marvels often took place around Christian holidays. Christmas in Camelot was a time of joyous celebration.

“Maybe I should be a vampire instead of a princess,” said Annie.

She and Jack were sitting on their front porch. A cool breeze rustled the trees. Autumn leaves twirled to the ground.

“But you already have your princess costume,” said Jack. “Besides, you were a vampire last Halloween.”

“I know, but I want to wear my big teeth again,” said Annie.

“So wear your big teeth and be a vampire-princess,” said Jack. He stood up. “I’m going to go put on my ghoul makeup now.”

KRAW!

“Oh, man!” said Jack.

A giant black bird swooped down to the ground. The bird strutted through the fallen leaves. Its feathers glistened in the golden afternoon light.

“Wow, is that a crow?” asked Annie.

“It’s too big for a crow,” said Jack. “I think it might be a raven.”

“A raven?” said Annie. “Cool.”

The raven lifted its sleek head and stared at them with bright eyes. Jack held his breath.

The bird hopped forward. It flapped its great black wings and lifted into the air. Then he glided into the autumn sky and headed toward the Frog Creek woods.

Annie jumped up. “It’s a sign! Morgan’s back!” she said.

“I think you’re right!” said Jack. “Let’s go!”

Jack and Annie hurried across their front yard, crunching through the leaves. They ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

When they came to the tallest oak, they saw the rope ladder swaying in the wind. The magic tree house was waiting for them.

“Just as we thought,” Annie said, smiling.

Jack followed her up the ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, they saw no sign of Morgan le Fay, the enchantress from the kingdom of Camelot.

“That’s weird,” said Jack, looking around.

The wind blew hard again, shaking the tree branches. A huge yellow leaf fluttered through the open window and came to rest at Jack’s feet.

“Oh, man,” he said. “Look at this.”

“What?” said Annie.

Jack picked up the leaf. There was writing on it. The letters were curvy and old-fashioned.

“Wow,” whispered Annie. “What does it say?”

Jack held the leaf up to the tree house window. In the fading light, he read aloud:



“M!” said Annie. “Morgan never signs her messages with M. … ”

“Right … ,” said Jack. “But … ”

“Merlin does!” they said together.

“Like when he sent us the invitation to spend Christmas in Camelot,” said Annie. She pointed to the Royal Invitation that still lay in the corner of the tree house.

“Now he’s inviting us on Halloween!” said Jack. “Halloween was called ‘All Hallows Eve’ a long time ago.”

“I know,” said Annie. “We have to go!”

“Of course,” said Jack. There was no way they could turn down an invitation from the master magician of all time. “But how do we get there?”

“I’ll bet our invitation will take us,” said Annie, “like when we went to King Arthur’s castle on Christmas Eve.”

“Good idea,” said Jack. He pointed to the fancy writing on the leaf. “I wish we could go—uh—”

“To where this leaf invitation came from!” said Annie.

“Right!” said Jack.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Haunted Castle on Hallows Eve is the second in a special group of Magic Tree House books called “The Merlin Missions.” In these books, it is Merlin the magician who sends Jack and Annie on their tree house adventures, often to mythical and legendary lands.

In the first Merlin Mission, Christmas in Camelot, Jack and Annie journeyed into a world of magic and fantasy to find a secret cauldron that held the Water of Memory and Imagination.

Now, nearly a year later, Jack and Annie are about to set out on a new Merlin Mission. They invite you to come with them to an outlying realm of Camelot where strange and eerie things are happening at a duke’s castle.

Enjoy your journey! But beware—in the world of Merlin the magician, anything can happen….

For Will, the real magician

No banquet decks the board;

No page stands ready at the call,

To ’tend his wearied lord.

1 All Hallows Eve

“Maybe I should be a vampire instead of a princess,” said Annie.

She and Jack were sitting on their front porch. A cool breeze rustled the trees. Autumn

leaves twirled to the ground.

“But you already have your princess costume,” said Jack. “Besides, you were a vampire last Halloween.”

“I know, but I want to wear my big teeth again,” said Annie.

“So wear your big teeth and be a vampire-princess,” said Jack. He stood up. “I’m going to go put on my ghoul makeup now.”

KRAW!

“Oh, man!” said Jack.

A giant black bird swooped down to the ground. The bird strutted through the fallen leaves. Its feathers glistened in the golden afternoon light.

The raven lifted its sleek head and stared at them with bright eyes. Jack held his breath.

Jack and Annie hurried across their front yard, crunching through the leaves. They ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

“To where this leaf invitation came from!” said Annie.

“Right!” said Jack.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2 The Heart of the Oak

Jack opened his eyes. A chilly wind blew into the tree house. Oak leaves swirled outside the window.

“Look, we have our costumes,” said Annie. “I’m not a princess or a vampire.”

Jack looked at their clothes. He was wearing a knee-length tunic and tights. Annie was wearing a long dress with an apron.

“Camelot costumes,” Jack said softly.

They looked out the window together. They were high in a huge oak tree in a thick forest.

The afternoon sun was low in the autumn sky.

“So what do we do now?” said Jack.

“The invitation says we’re supposed to meet Merlin in the heart of the oak,” said Annie.

“Yeah, but what does that mean?” said Jack, scowling. “The heart of an oak?”

“Let’s go down and try to figure it out,” said Annie.

She carefully placed their invitation in a corner of the tree house. Then she and Jack climbed down the rope ladder. They stepped onto the leafy ground. In the fading daylight, they began circling the base of the giant oak.

They walked all the way around, until they came to the rope ladder again.

“We’re back where we started,” said Jack. “We never found the heart.”

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “What’s that?” She pointed to a long, thin crack in the bark of the tree trunk. A sliver of light seemed to be coming from the crack.

Jack touched the bark around the light. He pushed. The crack got bigger.

“It’s a secret door!” said Jack. He pushed harder. Creak. A tall, narrow door swung into the tree. Light streamed from inside.

“We found it,” whispered Annie, “the heart of the oak.”

Jack nodded.

“Let’s go in,” said Annie. They slipped through the narrow doorway into the bright hollow of the tree trunk.



Jack couldn’t believe his eyes. The round room was lit with hundreds of candles. Shadows danced on the curved brown walls.

This isn’t possible! thought Jack. The heart of the oak seemed much bigger than the tree itself!

“Welcome,” said a deep, whispery voice.

They turned around and saw an old man sitting in a carved wooden chair. He had a long white beard and wore a red cloak.

“Hi, Merlin,” said Annie.

“Hello, Annie. Hello, Jack. It is good to see you again,” the magician said. “I am grateful for the help you gave us on Christmas Eve in Camelot. Now Morgan and I believe you might be able to help us again.”

“We’d love to!” said Annie.

“The whole future of our kingdom depends upon your success,” said Merlin.

“Are you sure you want us?” Jack asked. “I mean, we’re just kids.”

“You have passed many tests for Morgan,” said Merlin. “Are you not Master Librarians and Magicians of Everyday Magic?”

Jack nodded. “Yes, we are,” he said.

“Good. You will need all your skills on this mission,” said Merlin. “You will also need a helper and guide from our world, the world of magic and legend.”

“Are you coming with us?” asked Annie.

“No,” the magician said. “Your guide shall be one much younger than I. He is in my library now. Yesterday he brought me some books I had requested from Morgan’s library.”

Merlin rose from his chair. “Come,” he said, leading them to a door in the curved wall. He opened it and stepped into another room. Jack and Annie followed him.

The musty room was filled with scrolls and ancient-looking books. Sitting on the floor was a boy about eleven or twelve years old. He was reading by the light of a lantern.



“Your helper and guide,” Merlin said to Jack and Annie.

The boy looked up. He had a friendly, freckled face and dark, twinkly eyes. He broke into a big grin.

“Arf, arf!” he said.

“Teddy!” cried Annie.

Jack couldn’t believe it! Their helper was the young sorcerer who was training as Morgan’s apprentice!

Merlin, for once, looked surprised. “You already know each other?” he asked.

“Yes, we met a while ago when I accidentally changed myself into a dog!” said Teddy.

“Morgan wanted to teach Teddy a lesson,” explained Annie. “So she sent him with us on four tree-house journeys before she changed him back into a boy. He saved us on the Titanic. And he saved us from a buffalo stampede!”

“And from a tiger in India,” said Jack, “and a forest fire in Australia.”

“Wondrous journeys, indeed,” said Merlin. “I am glad you are already friends. Your friendship may help you on this mission.”

“What is our mission?” asked Annie.

“We are now in one of the outlying realms of Camelot,” said Merlin. “Beyond these woods lies the castle of a duke.”

Merlin leaned forward, as if he were about to tell them something really scary. “It will be your mission,” he said, “to bring order to the duke’s castle.”

Merlin sat back in his chair. His gaze was calm, but a fierce light shone in his eyes.

Bring order to a castle? thought Jack. Is that all?

“Who messed it up, sir?” asked Annie.

“You will find out soon enough,” said Merlin.

“We accept our assignment gladly,” said Teddy. “The mission will be done without fail!”

Merlin fixed his gaze on Teddy. “Perhaps,” he said. “But a warning, my boy: you are hasty and careless with your magic rhymes. On this mission, you must choose all your words wisely.”

“Indeed I will,” said Teddy.

Merlin turned to Jack and Annie. “And a warning to you, too,” he said. “You are about to enter a tunnel of fear. Proceed onward with courage, and you will come out into the light.”

Tunnel of fear? Jack thought.

Merlin picked up the lantern and handed it to Teddy. “The duke’s castle lies to the east. Go quickly,” he said. “Order must be restored as soon as possible.”

Teddy nodded at Merlin. Then he turned to Jack and Annie. “To the duke’s castle!” he said, and he led them out of the heart of the oak.



3 Rok

It was cooler outside now. Daylight was fading quickly. The wind had picked up.

“A grand adventure for us, eh?” said Teddy.

“Yes!” said Annie.

Jack was excited, too, but he had lots of questions. As Teddy started off through the oak forest, Jack hurried to keep up.

“What do you think our mission is exactly?” he asked.

“Merlin said we should bring order to the castle,” said Annie.

“Perhaps he wants us to mop the floors and wash the dishes,” Teddy joked.

“And make the beds!” said Annie. She and Teddy laughed.

“Our mission has to be harder than just doing chores,” said Jack. “What about the tunnel of fear?”

“Oh, you need not be afraid of fear,” said Teddy. “I know magic, remember?”

“Teddy, did you know any magic before you met Morgan and Merlin?” asked Annie.

“Ah, indeed. My father was a sorcerer,” Teddy said. “And my mother was a wood sprite from the Otherworld.”

“That is so cool,” said Annie.

They crunched through piles of dead leaves. A gust of wind shook the tree branches. Golden oak leaves spun to the ground.

Jack’s thoughts were spinning, too. Merlin in the heart of the oak, sorcerers, wood sprites— none of these things would ever make sense back in Frog Creek.

At last Teddy led them out of the forest and into a clearing. “Halt!” he said.

They all stopped walking. Beyond the clearing was a small village of thatched-roof cottages. The cottage windows twinkled with candlelight. Chimney smoke rose into the dusky sky.

Teddy held up his lantern. “Onward!” he said.

They went down a dirt path that passed through the village. Several children in ragged clothes peeked out their front doors.

“Greetings!” called Teddy. “Can you tell us how to get to the castle of the duke?”

“The castle?” a boy said in a frightened voice. “’Tis just beyond the wood!” He pointed at a forest on the other side of the village. “Follow the path and you’ll come to it!”

“Oh, but you mustn’t go there!” a girl cried.

“Why not?” asked Annie.

“Something’s been very wrong at the castle,” said the girl. “Ever since the ravens came!”

“Has anyone been there to see what’s going on?” asked Jack.

“Only old Maggie, who used to work there,” said the girl. “Two weeks ago, she went to the castle as usual. But she came running back, scared out of her wits.”

“Maggie says the castle is all haunted with ghosts,” said a boy. “She keeps repeating the same rhyme over and over.”

“Ghosts?” said Jack. His mouth felt dry.

But Teddy just laughed. “Ghosts don’t scare me!” he said.

“Have you ever seen one, Teddy?” asked Annie.

“No! But I should like to!” Teddy said with a grin.

“Look!” One of the girls pointed at the sky. “The ravens are back!”

A flock of large black birds was flying low in the dark gray sky. The village kids screamed. Several grown-ups rushed out of their cottages.

“Go away!” a woman yelled at the ravens. She picked up a handful of stones and began throwing them at the birds. “Leave us alone!”

“Stop! Stop!” cried Annie. “You’ll hurt them!”

A stone struck one of the ravens. It fell to the ground.

“Oh, no!” cried Annie.

The grown-ups pulled their children inside. Doors slammed and shutters closed.

Annie dashed to the fallen bird and knelt beside it.

Jack and Teddy hurried over to Annie and the fallen bird. The bird was crouching, slightly spreading its wings. Its head was bowed as it made low, squeaking sounds. One of its tail feathers was bent.

“COO-COO!” Teddy said loudly. He looked at Jack. “I once journeyed to the Isle of Birds to study their language,” he said. “I learned a bit of Dove, but no Raven.”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “Annie talks to birds and animals in her own language.”



“I’m sorry for what they did to you,” Annie said softly to the raven. She stroked its silky black head. “What’s your name?”

“ROK,” the raven croaked.

“Rok? Your name is Rok?” said Annie.

“ROK! ROK!” croaked the raven.

“See, I told you,” Jack said to Teddy.

“Rok, they were afraid of you for some reason,” Annie said.

Rok made soft, bell-like sounds: “CRONG? CRONG?”

“Yes, that’s why they knocked you out of the sky,” said Annie. “One of your tail feathers is bent. But your wings don’t seem hurt.”

Rok fluttered his long black wings. He took a few feeble steps.

“Go on, Rok,” Annie coaxed. “You can do it.”

The raven flapped his wings again. “QUORK!” he croaked.

He lifted off the ground.

“Great!” said Annie, clapping.

Rok flapped his wings. He glided up into the twilight. He swooped with ease back down to Annie. “CAW! CAW!” he called, as if thanking her.

“Be careful, Rok!” Annie shouted.

They all waved as the raven sailed off into the sky.

Annie smiled at Jack and Teddy. “He was really nice,” she said.

“Indeed he was,” said Teddy. “I think your gentle words were healing to him.”

“I wonder why the people here are so afraid of ravens,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “And what was that stuff about ghosts?”

“Ghosts?” said Teddy. He smiled. “You needn’t fear ghosts if you’re with me.”

Jack shrugged. “I’m not really afraid,” he said.

“Not afraid?” said a feeble voice.

Jack, Annie, and Teddy whirled around.

An old woman stood in the dark doorway of a cottage. She leaned forward. In a cracked voice, she said:

Where is the girl

who spins wool into thread?

Where are the boys

who play chess before bed?

Where is the hound

who waits to be fed?



The old woman stared at them with a fearful look in her eyes. Then she stepped back into her cottage and closed her door.

A shiver went up Jack’s spine. “That was strange,” he said.



“She must have been old Maggie, who worked at the castle,” said Annie. “I wonder what she was talking about.”

“I don’t know,” said Teddy. Then he grinned. “But she was good at rhyming, eh?”

Jack nodded. “Indeed she was,” he said softly.

“Let’s hurry along!” said Teddy. “Night comes fast upon us!”

Leaving the cottages behind, the three hurried on in the gathering dark. They left the village and followed the path through the woods.

Teddy held up his lantern to light their way. The wind blew the branches of the trees, making them whisper in the chilly autumn night.

When they finally came out of the woods, they all gasped in wonder.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

Towering before them in the moonlight were the walls of a huge stone castle.


4 The Castle


Demo version limitation



5 Ghosts!

“AHHH!” yelled Teddy.

“AHHH!” yelled Jack.

“AHHH!” yelled Annie.

Still screaming, they all ran toward the door. The bone came after them.

Teddy led the way as they tore through the archway and scrambled up the winding staircase.

Jack looked behind them.

“It’s still coming!” he shrieked.

“AHHH!” they all screamed again.



On the next landing, Teddy charged into a nearby room.

“Make haste!” he yelled.

He pulled Jack and Annie into the room and slammed the door behind them. Out of breath, they all leaned against the door, panting and trembling.

“Safe—” Teddy gasped. “Safe from the bone!” Then he started laughing.

Jack laughed, too. He laughed out of sheer terror. He couldn’t stop.

“Listen, guys! Listen!” said Annie. “I hear a noise!”

Teddy stopped laughing. Jack clapped his hand over his mouth. He listened. He heard a faint clicking sound, but he couldn’t see anything.

Teddy used the fire from his lantern to light torches near the door. Then they all looked about.

“Looks like a nursery,” said Teddy.

The torchlight showed a kids’ room. The room had three small beds. Wooden toys were scattered across the floor. A long white curtain fluttered from an open window.

The clicking noise seemed to be coming from a dark corner.

“What is that?” whispered Annie. She started toward the noise.

Jack and Teddy followed her. Teddy held up his lantern. His light shone on a child-sized spinning wheel. It sat in the corner near a basket of wool and a tall, dusty mirror.

The spinning wheel was spinning thread. But no one was touching it. It was spinning all by itself.

“Look!” whispered Annie.

She pointed to a low table near the spinning wheel. On the table was a chessboard. Large wooden chess pieces sat on the squares of the board.

But some of the pieces weren’t just sitting!

As Jack, Annie, and Teddy watched, a horse piece slid slowly from one square to another. Then a queen piece did the same!

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Ghosts!” said Teddy.

“Let’s get out of here!” said Jack.



They bolted across the room. Teddy threw open the door. The white bone was hanging in the air, right outside the door!

“AHHH!” they all screamed.

Teddy slammed the door shut. They huddled together, afraid to leave and afraid to stay. Jack’s heart was beating wildly. He couldn’t breathe.

“I—I thought you weren’t afraid of ghosts!” he said to Teddy, gasping.

“Yes, well, I believe I just discovered that I am!” said Teddy.

“What’ll we do?” said Jack.

“A rhyme—a rhyme,” said Teddy. He gave Annie his lantern. He threw out his arms and started a rhyme:

Spirits of the earth and air!

He looked at Jack and Annie. “Quick, what rhymes with air?”

“Bear!” said Jack.

Teddy shook his head. “I fear a bear might make things worse.”

Jack tried hard to think of a better word to rhyme with air.

“Wait a minute!” said Annie. “I get it now! I get it!” She grinned at Jack and Teddy.

Has she lost her mind? Jack wondered.

“Remember what old Maggie said?” asked Annie. Then she recited:

“Where is the girl

who spins wool into thread?”

Annie pointed at the spinning wheel in the corner. “There she is!” she said. “She’s spinning at that wheel.”

Annie recited more:

“Where are the boys

who play chess before bed?”

Annie pointed at the chess table. “There they are!” she said. “They’re probably her brothers! They’re playing chess!”

She recited more:

“Where is the hound

who waits to be fed?”

Annie threw open the door to the nursery.

The bone was still hanging in the air. Jack and Teddy jumped back in fear.

“Don’t be afraid!” said Annie. “It’s just a dog—a hound! He’s carrying a bone in his mouth. Don’t you see? The girl, the boys, the hound—they’re all here! They’re just invisible!”


6 Merlin’s Diamond


Jack and Teddy were speechless. They kept staring at Annie as she got down on her knees and talked to the invisible dog.

“Hi, you,” she said in a soft voice. “Are you hungry?”

The bone dropped toward the floor. It flipped over, then rocked from side to side.

“See,” Annie said to Jack and Teddy. “Now he’s rolling on his back with his bone in his mouth. Poor thing.”

“Poor thing?” said Jack.

“We have to help him,” said Annie. She stood up. “We have to help them, too—the girl and her brothers.”

She hurried across the room. Jack and Teddy followed. Annie stopped at the small spinning wheel.

“We can’t see you,” said Annie, “but we’re not afraid of you. We want to help you. Can you hear me?”

The spinning wheel stopped spinning.

“She can hear us!” Annie said to Jack and Teddy. Annie turned back to the ghost girl. “What happened to you and your brothers and your dog and everyone else in the castle? How did you all become invisible?”

Jack felt a wave of cold air whoosh past him.

“I think she’s moving,” said Annie.

“Aye,” said Teddy, “to the looking glass. See?”

An invisible finger had begun to write something in the thick dust of the mirror. Four words slowly appeared:



“I can’t believe it!” said Teddy. “This must be the secret castle that guards the Diamond of Destiny!”

“What’s that?” said Jack.

“A magic diamond that belongs to Merlin,” said Teddy. “It was set in the handle of the very sword King Arthur pulled from the stone many years ago.”

“Oh, I know that story,” said Annie. “That’s how Arthur became king!”

“Yes!” said Teddy. “And someday the Diamond of Destiny will give the same strength and power to the next rightful ruler of Camelot.”

“That’s what Merlin must have meant when he said the future of Camelot depends on us,” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Teddy.

“Wait, wait,” said Jack. “I’m confused. What does the Diamond of Destiny have to do with invisible kids and dogs?”

“After Arthur became king, Merlin gave the diamond to a noble family of Camelot,” said Teddy. “The name of the family was kept secret. As long as the family kept the diamond safe, they would have good fortune. But should they fail to protect it, they would fade from life.”

“Oh! So the family let the diamond get stolen,” said Annie. “And now they’ve all turned into ghosts!”

“Precisely,” said Teddy.

“I wonder where the diamond was kept,” said Jack.

“Good question,” said Teddy. “Certainly some special hiding place, perhaps in one of the towers.”

“Guys, look!” said Annie. She pointed to the wall near the mirror.

A long, heavy tapestry had been pulled aside to reveal a small door in the stone wall. The door was slowly swinging open.

“The ghost girl!” said Annie. “She’s showing us the diamond’s secret hiding place!”

The three of them hurried to the stone wall and looked inside a tiny cabinet. The walls of the cabinet were made of gold and ivory. But the cabinet was empty.

Annie looked around. “Ghost girl?” she said. “Who stole the Diamond of Destiny from its hiding place?”

Letters began to appear on the mirror again.

In the thick dust, the invisible finger wrote:





“Oh, no,” whispered Teddy. “Please, no.” Jack felt a fresh wave of fear. “Oh-no-please-no-what?” he said.

“Wait,” said Teddy, pointing at the mirror. The finger wrote one more word in the dust:





“Just as I feared,” said Teddy in a hushed voice. “The Raven King!”



7 One, Two, Three!

“So that’s why Merlin sent for those books!” said Teddy.

“What books? Who’s the Raven King?” said Jack.

“Now it all makes sense,” said Teddy.

“Who’s the Raven King?” said Jack.

“But I wonder how he found the Diamond of Destiny,” said Teddy.

“Teddy, who’s the Raven King?” Jack nearly shouted.

“He’s a terrifying creature who comes from the Otherworld,” said Teddy. “I read all about him in one of the books I brought Merlin from Morgan’s library. As a boy, the Raven King longed to be a bird so he could fly. He stole a spell from the Wizard of Winter, but he didn’t have the magic to make it work properly. So the spell only worked halfway. It made him half bird and half human.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

“Now he commands a huge army of ravens who treat him as their king,” said Teddy.

“Why would he steal the Diamond of Destiny?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Teddy, “but we must get it back! For the sake of Camelot’s future!”

“And for these ghost kids, too,” said Annie, “and the ghost dog!”

She looked around the room. “Don’t worry!” she called. “We’ll help all of you! We’ll get the Diamond of Destiny back!”

“We will?” asked Jack. “How? We don’t know where this crazy raven man lives or anything.”

“Look! More writing,” whispered Teddy. “She heard you.”

Three more words slowly appeared in the mirror dust:





Jack felt cold air whoosh by him again. The curtain covering the window moved aside. A patch of moonlight shone on the floor.

Jack, Annie, and Teddy walked to the window and looked out. In the distance, a craggy mountain rose into the moonlit sky.

“Ah!” whispered Teddy. “So there dwells the Raven King! I had thought his nest was in the Otherworld.”

“It might as well be,” said Jack. “We’ll never be able to get to the top of that mountain.”

“Aye,” said Teddy, “no mere mortal can climb that steep rock.”

“How will we get the diamond back?” cried Annie.

“I said no mere mortal,” said Teddy. “I am more than a mortal, remember? I’m a sorcerer.”

“Yeah, but your rhymes never work,” said Annie.

“True, but I have more than just rhymes,” said Teddy. He pulled a twig out of his pocket. “See?”

“What’s that?” said Jack.

“’Tis an enchanted hazel twig,” said Teddy. “Its magic is strong enough to change me into anything I want.”

“Oh, wow,” said Annie.

“Did Morgan give you that?” asked Jack.

“No,” said Teddy. “Morgan and Merlin do not even know I have it. A forest sprite, a cousin of my mother’s, gave it to me, in case I was ever in urgent need.”

“So what do you want to change into?” asked Annie.

“Why, a raven, of course!” Teddy said.

Teddy’s crazy, thought Jack.

But Annie didn’t seem to think so. “What a cool idea,” she said.

They’re both crazy, thought Jack.

“’Tis cool indeed,” said Teddy. He held up the twig.

“Wait a minute!” said Jack. “Do you have a plan? I mean, what’re you going to do once you change into a raven?”

“I shall fly up to the mountain nest,” said Teddy. “Find the diamond. Bring it back. Mission done.”

“And what do we do?” asked Annie.

“Wait here for me. I’ll be back as soon as I can,” said Teddy. He climbed up onto the window ledge. His moon shadow stretched across the floor.

“Good luck!” said Annie.

“Thank you!” said Teddy. He raised his hazel twig.

“Stop!” said Jack. “Can we discuss your ‘plan’ a little more?”

But Teddy was already sweeping his hazel twig through the air. He waved it from the top of his head to the tips of his toes.

“Teddy, stop!” said Jack.

But Teddy started his rhyme:

“O hazel twig from hazel tree!

Make me a raven—”

“Quick,” he said, “a word that rhymes with tree?”

“Wait!” said Jack.

“Doesn’t rhyme with tree,” said Teddy.

“Three!” said Annie.

“Brilliant!” said Teddy. He started again:

“O hazel twig from hazel tree!

Make me a raven one, two, three!”

He waved the twig wildly.

“Careful!” said Jack. He ducked and covered his head.

Suddenly he heard a roar. He felt a blast of heat. Then he heard a strange screech.

Jack looked up. Teddy’s hazel twig had fallen to the floor. Jack saw Teddy’s shadow on the floor, too. But it was no longer the shadow of a boy.

A chill went through Jack.

A large raven was perched on the window-sill. Moonlight shone on its sleek blue-black wings, its shaggy throat feathers, its thick neck and big beak.

A second raven stood beneath the window. It looked like the first, only smaller.

Where’s Annie? Jack wondered wildly. He tried calling her name. But a terrible croak came from the back of his throat: “AWK-NEE!”

Jack felt as if he were caught in a terrible nightmare. With jerky turns of his head, he peered down at his own body.

His arms had turned into jet-black wings. His legs were spindly twigs that ended in four long, skinny toes with curved claws.

Teddy had accidentally changed them all into ravens. One, two, three.



8 SPREE! SPREE!

“CRA-JAH! CRA-AWK-NEE!” Teddy croaked.

Teddy was speaking Raven now, but Jack understood him perfectly. Teddy had said, Sorry, Jack and Annie!

Annie stepped forward. She fluttered to the window ledge and perched with Teddy.

“GRA-QUORK!” she croaked. That’s okay! This is fun!

“QUORK?” Jack squeaked. Fun?

“GRO-JAH!” croaked Annie. “KAH-SPREE!” Come on, Jack! Let’s fly!

Annie and Teddy lifted off the ledge and disappeared into the moonlit mist.

This can’t be real, thought Jack. It can’t be real!

He looked at his feathers and claws. He stretched out his right wing, then his left. He flapped them both. Before he knew what was happening, he lifted clumsily off the floor and landed on the window ledge.

Jack saw Annie and Teddy flying around in the moonlight. They were zipping about like acrobats—diving and tumbling through the air.

“AWK-NEE CAW!” Jack croaked. Annie, come back!

“SPREE! SPREE!” she called. Fly! Fly!

“AWK-NEE!”

Annie rose from a dive. In one easy swoop, she glided up and sat beside Jack on the window ledge.

This is so much fun, Jack! she croaked. Don’t just sit here!

Teddy flew by them. I’m off to the mountain-top! he croaked. Fly with me!

Come on, Jack! croaked Annie. She took off after Teddy, swooping through the cool night air.

Oh, man! Fear clutched Jack’s small raven heart. I have definitely entered the tunnel of fear now, he thought. Merlin’s words echoed in his mind: “Proceed onward with courage, and you will come out into the light.”

Jack looked out at the night. He closed his eyes. He jumped off the ledge.

Jack was falling! He opened his eyes and flapped. His wings lifted him up. He steadied himself. He hovered in the cold night air, his eyes darting from right to left. He looked down. He nearly fainted! The castle courtyard was far below!

Jack flapped wildly. He glided. He flapped again. He glided. Flapping and gliding, he climbed higher and higher into the sky.

Finally Jack caught up with Annie and Teddy. They were circling in the air, waiting for him.

“RARK!” Jack croaked. Onward!

The three of them flew together through the moonlit night, heading for the nest of the Raven King. Except for the swooshing of their wings, they made no noise.

They soared up the side of the mountain, past hemlocks and tall pines. They flew through long, misty clouds.

As they glided toward the mountain’s peak, Teddy let out a low croak: Raven troops!

Jack peered through the night. He couldn’t believe his eyes. In the white moonlight, he saw thousands of ravens roosting on rocky ledges!

Jack, Annie, and Teddy kept flying. They soared above the troops, higher and higher, toward the craggy peak of the mountain. When they reached the top, Teddy let out a squawk.

There it is! he croaked. The nest of the Raven King!



9 A Piece of a Star

Teddy dropped down to a ledge. Jack and Annie followed. Hidden in the shadows, they crouched together, their dark feathers touching. They peered out at the moonlit lair of the Raven King.



The king’s giant nest was tucked under a rocky overhang. It was made of mud, twigs, and long strips of tree bark. Two raven sentries were guarding its dark entrance.

Okay, Jack softly croaked, what’s the plan?

Listen carefully, Teddy answered. In tiny queeks and caws of raven whispers, he spelled out a plan: I’ll distract the guards. Annie, you keep watch at the entrance. Jack, you go into the nest and get the diamond. Then both of you head back to the castle and wait for me there.

What about the Raven King? croaked Jack.

I sense he’s not here, croaked Teddy. I see no legions of bodyguards. But we should hurry before he returns.

Jack had lots more questions about the plan. But before he could ask them, Teddy lifted off his perch and flew toward the entrance.

Let’s go! cried Annie, rising into the air.

Jack was in a panic. He fluffed out his feathers and croaked, Wait, you guys!

But it was too late! Teddy was already dive-bombing the raven sentries!

“ARK-ARK-ARK!”

The two sentries left their watch and flew at Teddy with short shrieks. They chased him high into the sky.

Annie zipped to the entrance of the nest. Come on, Jack! she croaked.

Jack jumped off the ledge and flew on to the giant nest. Without thinking, he stepped through the entrance.

He jerked his head from side to side. With his raven sight, he saw walls packed with dried mud, animal fur, vines, and sticks. The floor was covered with moss.

Jack took a few steps forward. He stopped. He saw no sign of the Raven King. He cocked his head from side to side, listening. All was quiet.

Jack looked around the nest. One part of the nest’s wall looked different. It was black and shiny. He stepped toward it. He touched it with his beak. It wasn’t a wall at all. It was a curtain of feathers.

Jack pushed through the feather curtain. Moonlight shone into the space behind it. Heaps of gold and silver coins glittered in the cool light. Pale pearls, emeralds, and rubies shone and sparkled.

Amid all the treasure was a blue-white crystal. It was no bigger than a marble. But it shone with a light all its own, like a piece of a star.

Jack knew at once the stone was the Diamond of Destiny. His raven heart thumping, he walked to the diamond and nudged it with his beak. As the diamond tilted, it shot forth beams of brilliant light.

“JAH! JAH!” Annie was calling to him from outside. “CREE-GRO!” They’re coming!

Jack carefully picked up the diamond with his beak. He felt a surge of strength and courage.

Annie called another warning. But Jack wasn’t afraid at all. He calmly walked out of the Raven King’s nest back into the night.

More sentries had been alerted. They were flying toward the mountaintop, cawing madly in alarm.

“KRAK! KRAK! KRAK!”

Jack saw Annie perched on the ledge. Hurry, Jack! Hurry! she croaked.

Annie flew off the mountain. Holding the diamond in his beak, Jack gracefully flapped his wings and lifted into the air after her.

As he and Annie sailed down from the mountaintop, a chorus of KRAKs split the night. Thousands of roosting ravens rose into the sky like a giant black cloud. Their beating wings rumbled like thunder.

The cloud of ravens covered the light of the moon. The night was completely black.

“SPREE! SPREE!” Annie croaked. Fly! Fly!

She and Jack glided down through the dark sky toward the duke’s castle. The wing beats of the raven army still thundered above the mountaintop. But none of the ravens were chasing them.

They don’t know what to do without their king, Jack thought. He wondered where their king was. But with the Diamond of Destiny in his beak, he felt no fear.

The farther Jack and Annie flew from the mountain, the more distant became the sound of the raven soldiers’ wings.

The duke’s castle came into sight. Jack saw the light of Teddy’s lantern in the nursery. But he didn’t want to stop flying just yet. Instead, he swooped over the castle keep, over the courtyard, the gatehouse, and the bridge, over the candlelit cottages and oak forest. Annie flew with him.

Finally they both glided smoothly back to the castle and landed on the window ledge of the nursery. The Diamond of Destiny was safe!



10 Where Is It?

Jack and Annie perched on the ledge and peered into the nursery. Teddy’s lantern and hazel twig were still on the floor. But there was no sign of Teddy.

Teddy’s not here yet, croaked Annie. Let’s go ahead and put the diamond back in its place.

Jack didn’t move. He didn’t want to give up the diamond quite yet. It still made him feel incredibly brave.

Jack? croaked Annie. Let’s put it back in its hiding place. I’ll move the tapestry.

Annie flapped to the long tapestry hanging on the wall. Fluttering in the air, she took its edge in her beak. She tried to pull it aside, but it was too heavy. She let go.

I can’t move it, she croaked, not as long as I’m a raven. I guess we’ll have to wait for Teddy to change us back into ourselves.

She flapped to the window ledge and landed beside Jack. Jack was relieved. The longer he could hold on to the diamond, the better.

Hey! croaked Annie. Maybe we could use Teddy’s magic hazel twig ourselves! I can come up with better rhymes than him anyway. It won’t hurt to try.

Jack shook his head. But Annie didn’t notice. She hopped down to the hazel twig under the window. She carefully picked it up with her beak.

She fluttered back up to the ledge beside Jack. Then she moved her head from side to side, passing the twig over Jack’s feathered head, his body, his wings, and his claws. The twig passed over her feathery body and wings as well.

With the twig still in her beak, she made a deep croaking sound.

“HA-HA-REE-REE!

JAH-JAH-AWK-NEE!”

O hazel twig from hazel tree!

Make him Jack, and make me, me!

There was a mighty roar and a flash of light and a blast of heat!

Then Jack heard Annie giggle. “Yippee! I made the magic work for us. Look.”

Jack looked down at his arms and legs and feet. “Ohh, man,” he breathed.

Awk-nee and Jah were gone. Annie and Jack were back.

Jack wiggled his fingers and toes. He felt his face: his mouth, his nose, his ears. He loved having his own body back!

“Teddy’s going to be so surprised,” said Annie.

“He acts like he’s the only kid who can do magic.” She looked around the nursery. “Hi! We’re back!” she called to the invisible children. “Guess what? We’ve got the diamond!”

“The diamond! Where is it?” said Jack. “I must’ve dropped it when you changed us!”

Suddenly they heard a swoosh and a flapping at the window.

“Teddy!” cried Annie. She and Jack whirled around.

But Teddy wasn’t there.

Instead, perched on the ledge of the nursery window was a horrifying creature. He was part human and part raven. He had silky feathers for hair, a beak for a nose, sharp claws, and a billowing feathered cape that glistened in the moonlight like shiny black armor.

“Good evening,” said the Raven King.



11 Or Else!

Jack and Annie were too stunned to speak.

Staring at the bizarre creature, Jack remembered the story of the Raven King—how the king had wanted to be a bird, how he had stolen a spell from the Wizard of Winter, how the spell had worked only halfway and left him half bird and half human.

The Raven King jumped from the window to the floor. One by one, his raven bodyguards swooshed into the room after him. At least twenty ravens came through the window. Soon Jack and Annie were surrounded by dark wings, sharp beaks, and bright eyes.

Once his guards were in place, the Raven King twisted his head from side to side, looking from Jack to Annie. “Where are the two ravens who stole my diamond?” he asked in a raspy voice.

“What diamond?” asked Annie.



“What … what ravens?” asked Jack, his voice trembling. He wished desperately that he still had the Diamond of Destiny to give him strength and courage.

“The ravens that came to this castle after raiding my treasure room,” said the Raven King. “Where are they hiding?”

Jack tried to imagine that he was still holding the diamond. “We don’t know anything about them,” he said in a low, steady voice. Pretending to hold the diamond actually made him feel brave.

“You don’t know anything about them?” said the Raven King.

“No,” said Jack. “You must have the wrong castle.”

“Ah, the wrong castle,” said the Raven King.

“Yes,” said Jack.

“Perhaps you’re right,” said the Raven King. “But are you certain you haven’t seen them? They look very much like this little one here.”

The Raven King threw his cape over his shoulder and held up an iron birdcage. A raven was held captive inside.



“JAH, AWK-NEE!” the raven croaked.

“Teddy!” cried Annie.

“His name is Teddy?” said the Raven King. “How charming. I’ve caught a Teddy. I think he’ll make a wonderful pet, don’t you?”

Jack was horrified to see Teddy trapped in the Raven King’s cage. “It’s not charming,” he said. “It’s cruel. You better let him go, or else!”

“Yeah, let him go,” said Annie. “Or else.”

“Or else?” said the Raven King. “Or else what?” With backward jerks of his head, he laughed a raspy laugh.

As the king laughed, Jack glanced at the floor under the window. He saw the hazel twig. He moved toward it.

The Raven King caught sight of him. His laugh stopped abruptly. “CREE! CAW!” he croaked to one of his bodyguards.

Jack dashed for the twig. But before he could grab it, the king’s bodyguard had swooped across the floor and picked up the twig in his beak. As the raven carried it to the top of the window, Jack noticed that one of his tail feathers was bent.

“Jack, look, it’s Rok!” said Annie. She called up to the bird. “Rok! Rok!”

From his perch above the window, the raven looked down at Annie.

“Rok, it’s me, Annie,” she said. “I helped you when the people in the village threw stones at you. Remember?”

“What nonsense,” croaked the Raven King. “Bring me the stick, bird.”

Rok didn’t move. Gripping the hazel twig in his beak, he stared down at Annie.

“Give the twig to Jack, Rok,” she said. “So he can turn Teddy back into a boy.”

“So that ugly little stick is a magic wand, is it?” said the Raven King. “Bring it to me, bird. Now!”

“Don’t do it, Rok,” said Annie. “Don’t let him boss you around anymore.”

The raven stared at Annie for a moment with his dark brown eyes. He looked at the Raven King. He looked back at Annie. Then he swooped down to Jack and dropped the hazel twig at his feet.

Jack grabbed it.

“Traitor!” the Raven King shrieked at Rok. “You’ll pay for this!” He lunged toward the raven. Rok tried to escape, but the king grabbed him by the throat.

Jack had to save Rok! He pointed the twig at the Raven King’s back and shouted:

“O hazel twig from hazel tree!

Make him what he wanted to be!”

A deafening wind roared through the room. A blinding light flashed. Then all was clear.

The Raven King had vanished. His cape lay on the floor. Rok hopped away, unharmed.

From under the feathered cape came a hoarse cry. Awk.

Annie lifted the cape and uncovered a tiny raven. “Ohh!” she said softly.

The bird stretched out his scrawny neck. Awk, he croaked again.

“Hello yourself,” Annie said, smiling. She stroked the downy feathers on the creature’s head. Then she looked up at Jack. “How did you come up with that rhyme?”

“It just came to me,” said Jack.

“I knew I had to save Rok. But I didn’t want to hurt the Raven King. I think I actually felt sorry for him.”

“So you helped him finally get what he wanted,” said Annie. “You turned him into a baby raven.”

“Yeah,” Jack said. “Now he can live his whole life as a bird.”

Rok flew up to the window ledge. He looked around at the other ravens. It was clear he had become their new leader.

“GRO! GRO!” Rok croaked.

He stepped aside. The raven troops began to leave the nursery, one by one. Two of them escorted the new member of their flock as he timidly flapped his small wings.

Rok was the last to leave. He stared at Annie and Jack with a long gaze. Then he lifted off the window ledge and flew away into the light of the silver dawn.



12 A New Day

Queek.

A little croak came from the cage on the floor.

“Teddy!” cried Annie.

“We almost forgot you!” said Jack.

Queek, Teddy croaked again.

“Let me change him back,” Annie said to Jack.

“Okay, but let me get out of the way first,” said Jack. He handed Annie the hazel twig. Then he quickly stepped over to the window.

Annie moved closer to Teddy’s cage. She closed her eyes and thought for a moment. Then she waved the wand over the cage and said:

“O hazel twig from hazel tree!

Make him Teddy! Set him free!”

There was a mighty roar, a blast of heat, and a blaze of light! Then the cage was gone, and Teddy was a boy again, sitting on the floor.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“Nicely done,” said Teddy. “Thanks.”

“Welcome back!” said Jack. He and Annie helped Teddy stand up.

Teddy shook his arms and legs. “Ahhh! ’Tis good to be human again!” he said. “And now we must help the duke’s family. Where’s the diamond?”

“We lost it!” said Annie.

“Yeah, I had it in my beak,” said Jack. “But I must have dropped it when Annie changed us back into ourselves.”

“Don’t worry,” said Teddy, “it must be here somewhere.”

The three of them got on their hands and knees and started crawling around the floor of the nursery. There was no sign of the diamond. Suddenly Jack heard Teddy gasp.

“Oh, my,” Teddy whispered. “Look.” He was staring at the corner.

The Diamond of Destiny was rising from the basket of wool by the spinning wheel.

“The ghost girl must have hidden it when the Raven King came!” whispered Annie.

The diamond moved slowly toward Jack and stopped in front of him. Jack held out his hand, and the diamond settled into his palm.

“Thank you,” Jack said to the ghost girl. “I’ll put it back in its place now.”

Carefully holding the diamond, Jack crossed the room. Annie pulled the tapestry aside, and Jack opened the golden door of the cabinet.

He looked one last time at the shining stone. “I really felt brave when I was carrying this diamond,” he said softly.

“Jack,” said Annie, “you were pretty brave just now without it.”

“Indeed you were,” said Teddy.

Jack smiled. He carefully put the Diamond of Destiny back in its place and closed the golden door. Then Annie covered the cabinet once more with the tapestry.

The air in the nursery grew warmer. A girl began to take shape beside Teddy. She wore a white nightgown. She had dark curly hair. She was about Teddy’s age.



At the chess table, two boys took shape, too. They looked just alike. They were twins about Annie’s age.

At first the children were a bit pale and cloudy. Slowly they grew more and more visible, until they were solid and rosy-cheeked.

At the same time, a large brown dog became visible by the door. He barked and ran to the girl.

“Oliver!” she cried. She hugged him. Then she looked at Jack, Annie, and Teddy. She gave them a big smile. “Hello,” she said.

“Hi!” said Annie. “Are the three of you the only people in this castle?”

“Oh, no, everyone else is here, too,” the girl said, “but they were all asleep when the Raven King stole the diamond. We were supposed to be asleep, too. But sometimes we like to sneak out of bed and play. We were playing hide-and-seek when I found the secret door behind the tapestry. I wanted to see the diamond better, so I put it on the window ledge to catch the moonlight. Then Tom and Henry started to play chess—” She pointed to the boys.

“Gwendolyn started spinning,” said Tom. “And Oliver went down to the great hall to look for scraps.”



“That’s when the Raven King swooped down to the window and stole the diamond,” said Gwendolyn. “Before we could even go tell our mother and father, we began to fade away.”

“Mother! Father!” said Tom, as if he’d just remembered their parents. “We must wake them, Gwendolyn!”

“I know,” she said. “We shall go upstairs and wake them at once. Since they were sleeping, I suspect they never even knew they were invisible!”

Gwendolyn took her brothers’ hands, and the three of them started out of the nursery. At the door, she looked back at Jack, Annie, and Teddy. “Thank you for helping us,” she said, “whoever you are.”

The duke’s children then slipped out of the nursery. Oliver grabbed his bone and bounded after them.

Jack handed the hazel twig to Teddy.

“Listen,” Jack said. “I don’t think this is something that kids should play with—even sorcerer kids. You’d better give it back to your cousin.”

“Aye, perhaps that is a good plan,” said Teddy. He grinned impishly as he slipped the twig back into his pocket. Then he gestured toward the door. “Shall we?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

Teddy picked up his lantern and blew out the candle. Then he led them all out of the castle nursery into the hallway. As they started down the stairs, servants rushed by.

“Ring the bells!” one said.

“Bring water for the duke and duchess!” said another.

“We’re getting a late start today!” said a third.

Jack, Annie, and Teddy kept winding down the stairs, past the great hall, past the armor room, down to the entrance of the keep.

As they stepped into the courtyard, bright sunlight shone on the castle towers. The bells began to ring. Roosters crowed. Horses neighed.

Servants were making a big cooking fire. A blacksmith was pounding his anvil. A milkmaid was hauling her pails.

In the bright daylight, Jack, Annie, and, Teddy walked through the busy courtyard. They passed through the gatehouse and crossed the wooden bridge. When they got to the other side, they looked back.



Archers now stood guard on top of the castle walls.

Teddy waved to them. Then he looked at Jack and Annie. “Order has returned to the castle!” he said. “Our mission is done!”

Laughing, they ran through the patch of trees toward the small village. As they hurried along the dirt path past the cottages, they saw villagers in their doorways. They were all staring in the direction of the ringing castle bells.

Maggie, the old woman, grinned toothlessly at the three of them. “The bells are ringing again,” she said in a creaky voice.

“Yes!” said Jack. “The boys and the girl and the hound are all back! There’s nothing to be afraid of anymore. The whole castle is alive and well!”

Jack, Annie, and Teddy left the village and headed for the woods. As they walked through the fallen leaves, sunlight filtered down through the tree branches.

Merlin’s words echoed in Jack’s mind: You are about to enter a tunnel of fear. Proceed onward with courage, and you will come out into the light.

Jack looked around. The forest was bright with the most beautiful golden light he had ever seen.



13 Jack and Annie’s Magic

Jack, Annie, and Teddy crunched through fallen leaves until they came to Merlin’s oak. They found the hidden door near the rope ladder. Teddy pushed on the bark.

The door opened. One by one, they slipped into the candlelit hollow of the tree trunk. Merlin was sitting in his tall wooden chair.

“So you restored order to the castle?” he said calmly.

“Yes, sir,” said Teddy. “Had to use a bit of magic, but now all is well.”

“Your rhyming must have improved,” Merlin said to Teddy.

Teddy grinned sheepishly. “Well, to be truthful, the real magic was not in my rhymes. ’Twas the magic of Jack and Annie’s courage and kindness that saved the day—and saved me, too.”

“Indeed?” said Merlin.

“Aye,” said Teddy. “They have a magic as powerful as any sorcerer’s rhymes or enchanted hazel twig.”

Merlin raised a bushy eyebrow. “Enchanted hazel twig?” he said.

“’Tis only a figure of speech,” Teddy said quickly.

Merlin turned to Jack and Annie. “I thank you for your help,” he said. “All the realm of Camelot thanks you.”

“You’re welcome,” they said.

Merlin stood up. “Come along, my boy,” he said to Teddy. “I will help speed you back to Morgan now. My research is done. We must return these rare books to her library.”

He reached down and picked up a stack of ancient-looking books from the floor. He piled them into Teddy’s arms.



Teddy turned awkwardly with his books. Then he and Jack and Annie followed Merlin out of the heart of the oak.

The sun had risen higher in the sky. The woods were still.

Teddy peered over the tops of the books. “I suppose we must say good-bye now,” he said to Jack and Annie.

“When will we see you again?” asked Annie.

“When duty calls, I suppose,” said Teddy. He looked at Merlin.

The magician smiled.

“Will you be able to find your way home all right?” Teddy asked them.

“Oh, sure,” said Jack. “The tree house will take us back.”

He and Annie looked up at the magic tree house at the top of the oak. A sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves.

Jack and Annie turned back to Merlin and Teddy. But they were gone. Bright yellow leaves swirled and danced in the spot where they’d been standing.

“Wow …,” said Annie.

“Yeah …,” said Jack.

“Well,” said Annie, sighing. “Onward?”

“Homeward!” said Jack.

Annie started up the rope ladder. Jack followed. When they climbed inside the tree house, Merlin’s leaf invitation was fluttering off the floor. Before it could blow out the window, Annie grabbed it. She pointed to the words Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go there!” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

* * *

Jack opened his eyes. He and Annie sat quietly on the floor of the tree house for a moment. Jack looked out the window. High overhead, a bird was soaring through the dusky sky.

Jack could hardly believe that just a little while ago, he had been a bird himself.

“Ready to go home?” said Annie.

Jack nodded. There was no way to explain what had just happened to them, he thought. There was no way to even talk about it.

Annie carefully placed Merlin’s autumn leaf in the corner of the tree house, next to their Royal Christmas Invitation. Then she and Jack climbed down the ladder and started through the woods.

In the gathering dark of Halloween night, nothing seemed very spooky. Jack knew all the trees. He knew the familiar path out to their street.

As he and Annie headed toward home, three creatures stepped onto the sidewalk in front of them—a hideous witch, a grinning skeleton, and a huge, hairy eyeball.



The creatures cackled and rattled and hissed.

Jack and Annie laughed.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

“Good costumes,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie crossed their yard and climbed their front steps. “Are you ready for trick-or-treating?” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “You know, I think maybe I’ll stay home this year,” he said, “and help Mom and Dad give out the treats.”

“Yeah, maybe I will, too,” said Annie. “But I think I’ll wear my vampire-princess costume anyway.”

Jack smiled. “Cool,” he said.

Then he and Annie slipped inside their warm, cozy house—and closed the door against the dark of All Hallows Eve.


A Note from the Author


Fairy tales and mythology often inspire ideas for my work. While I was writing Haunted Castle on Hallows Eve, details of old stories from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, and Persia found their way into my story. For example, in a book of Celtic tales from Ireland and Wales, I read many stories about people being transformed into animals. I also read about an army of ravens called the “raven troops.” In a collection of stories from The Arabian Nights, I came across a magnificent bird called the Roc. All these legends stirred my imagination—and the next thing I knew, I was writing a story in which my characters transformed into ravens and saved the life of an amazing bird named Rok.

When researching the ancient world of the British Isles, I learned that it was common for people to have awe and respect for sacred stones. I learned, in particular, about a famous stone in Scotland known as the “Stone of Destiny,” which is surrounded by myth and legend. The stone was once used in sacred ceremonies for enthroning kings. This information inspired me to create Merlin’s “Diamond of Destiny.” And where did I get my idea for Teddy’s magic hazel wand? For many years, I have loved a certain poem by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. In the first stanza of “The Song of Wandering Aengus,” Yeats writes:

I went out to the hazel wood,

Because a fire was in my head,

And cut and peeled a hazel wand,

And hooked a berry to a thread;

And when white moths were on the wing,

And moth-like stars were flickering out,

I dropped the berry in a stream

And caught a little silver trout.



Old tales and poetry from around the world are a constant source of inspiration for story-tellers. Creating something new from something old allows us to link hands with people of the past. Or, as Morgan le Fay once said to Jack and Annie (in Magic Tree House #16, Hour of the Olympics), “The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.”

Jack was sitting on the porch reading the newspaper. It was a warm summer day, but the porch was shady and cool.

Annie poked her head out of the screen door. “Hey, Mom says she’ll drive us to the lake this afternoon,” she said.

Jack didn’t raise his eyes from the weather page. “Did you know today is the summer solstice?” he said.

“What’s that?” asked Annie.

“It’s the official first day of summer,” said Jack. “There’s more daylight today than on any other day of the year.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

“Starting tomorrow, the days will get shorter and shorter,” said Jack.

A loud screech came from overhead.

“Look,” said Annie, “a seagull!”

Jack looked up. A large white gull was circling in the bright noon sky. “What’s he doing here?” asked Jack. “The ocean’s two hours away.”

The gull swooped down and screeched again.

“Maybe he’s a messenger from Morgan or Merlin,” said Annie. “Maybe one of them sent him to tell us the tree house is finally back.”

Jack’s heart began to pound. He put down the newspaper. “You think so?” he asked.

Jack and Annie hadn’t seen the magic tree house since their Merlin Mission to a haunted castle last Halloween. Jack had begun to worry that the tree house might never come back.

“Look, he’s flying toward the woods,” said Annie.

Jack jumped up. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s go.”

“We’ll be back soon, Mom!” Annie called. Then she and Jack dashed across their yard. They ran down their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

The shady woods were dappled with sunlight. The air smelled fresh and clean. Jack and Annie hurried past the leafy trees, until they came to the tallest oak. High in the oak branches, the magic tree house was waiting for them.

“Wow,” Jack and Annie said together. The tree house looked exactly the same as when they’d last seen it.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed. When they climbed inside the tree house, no one was there.

“Look, our Royal Invitation is still here,” said Annie. She picked up the card that had taken them to Camelot on Christmas Eve.

“And our leaf from Merlin is still here,” said Jack. He picked up the yellow autumn leaf that had sent them on their Halloween mission.

“This is new,” said Annie. She picked up a pale blue seashell. The shell was shaped like a small fan. There was writing on it.

“Hey, this looks like Merlin’s handwriting!” said Annie. “We must be going on another mission for Merlin!” She read aloud the message from the magician:



Annie looked up. “What rhyme?” she said.

“Let me see.” Jack took the shell from her and turned it over. On the other side was a poem. Jack read the poem aloud:

Before night falls on this long summer day,

A shining sword must find its way

Into your hands and out of the gloom—

Or Camelot’s king shall meet his doom.

To begin your quest for this Sword of Light,

Call for the help of the Water Knight.

Then pass through the Cave of the Spider Queen—

“Spider Queen?” Annie interrupted. She frowned. Spiders were about the only thing she was afraid of.

“Don’t think about it now,” said Jack. “Let’s keep going.” He read on:

… pass through the Cave of the Spider Queen

And swim with a selkie clothed in green.

Enter the Cove of the Stormy Coast,

Dive ’neath the Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost—

Jack stopped reading. “Old Gray Ghost?” he said.

“Don’t think about it now,” said Annie. “Keep going.”

Jack read more:

Answer a question with love, not fear.

With rhyme and sword, your home is near.

Both Jack and Annie were silent for a moment. “That’s a lot to do before nightfall,” Jack finally said.

“Yeah,” said Annie, “and I’m a little worried about the spider part.”

“And the ghost part,” said Jack.

“Hey,” said Annie, “if we’re going on another Merlin Mission, I’ll bet Teddy will come with us! He can help us get through the scary parts.”

“Right,” said Jack. Just hearing Teddy’s name made him feel braver.

“So,” said Annie. “Onward?” Onward was Teddy’s favorite word.

“Onward!” said Jack. He pointed to the handwriting on the pale blue shell. “I wish we could go to the time before Camelot!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Dear Reader,





Summer of the Sea Serpent is the third in a special group of Magic Tree House books called “The Merlin Missions.” In these books, it is Merlin the magician who sends Jack and Annie on their tree house adventures, often to mythical and legendary lands.

In the first Merlin Mission, Christmas in Camelot, Jack and Annie journeyed into a world of magic and fantasy to find a secret cauldron that held the Water of Memory and Imagination.

In the second Merlin Mission, Haunted Castle on Hallows Eve, they traveled to a mysterious castle. With their friend Teddy, they saved the future of Camelot by finding the stolen Diamond of Destiny.

Now, eight months later, on the first day of summer, Jack and Annie are about to go to a lonley seacoast in a fantasy land. They invite you to join them on their adventure. But beware—before night falls, incredibly strange things will happen … .

1. Summer Solstice

Jack was sitting on the porch reading the newspaper. It was a warm summer day, but the porch was shady and cool.

Annie poked her head out of the screen door. “Hey, Mom says she’ll drive us to the lake this afternoon,” she said.

Jack didn’t raise his eyes from the weather page. “Did you know today is the summer solstice?” he said.

“What’s that?” asked Annie.

“It’s the official first day of summer,” said Jack. “There’s more daylight today than on any other day of the year.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

“Starting tomorrow, the days will get shorter and shorter,” said Jack.

A loud screech came from overhead.

“Look,” said Annie, “a seagull!”

Jack looked up. A large white gull was circling in the bright noon sky. “What’s he doing here?” asked Jack. “The ocean’s two hours away.”

The gull swooped down and screeched again.

“Maybe he’s a messenger from Morgan or Merlin,” said Annie. “Maybe one of them sent him to tell us the tree house is finally back.”

Jack’s heart began to pound. He put down the newspaper. “You think so?” he asked.

Jack and Annie hadn’t seen the magic tree house since their Merlin Mission to a haunted castle last Halloween. Jack had begun to worry that the tree house might never come back.

“Look, he’s flying toward the woods,” said Annie.

Jack jumped up. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s go.”

“We’ll be back soon, Mom!” Annie called. Then she and Jack dashed across their yard. They ran down their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

The shady woods were dappled with sunlight. The air smelled fresh and clean. Jack and Annie hurried past the leafy trees, until they came to the tallest oak. High in the oak branches, the magic tree house was waiting for them.

“Wow,” Jack and Annie said together. The tree house looked exactly the same as when they’d last seen it.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed. When they climbed inside the tree house, no one was there.

“Look, our Royal Invitation is still here,” said Annie. She picked up the card that had taken them to Camelot on Christmas Eve.

“And our leaf from Merlin is still here,” said Jack. He picked up the yellow autumn leaf that had sent them on their Halloween mission.

“This is new,” said Annie. She picked up a pale blue seashell. The shell was shaped like a small fan. There was writing on it.

“Hey, this looks like Merlin’s handwriting!” said Annie. “We must be going on another mission for Merlin!” She read aloud the message from the magician:



Annie looked up. “What rhyme?” she said.

“Let me see.” Jack took the shell from her and turned it over. On the other side was a poem. Jack read the poem aloud:

Before night falls on this long summer day,

A shining sword must find its way

Into your hands and out of the gloom—

Or Camelot’s king shall meet his doom.

To begin your quest for this Sword of Light,

Call for the help of the Water Knight.

Then pass through the Cave of the Spider Queen—

“Spider Queen?” Annie interrupted. She frowned. Spiders were about the only thing she was afraid of.

“Don’t think about it now,” said Jack. “Let’s keep going.” He read on:

… pass through the Cave of the Spider Queen

And swim with a selkie clothed in green.

Enter the Cove of the Stormy Coast,

Dive ’neath the Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost—

Jack stopped reading. “Old Gray Ghost?” he said.

“Don’t think about it now,” said Annie. “Keep going.”

Jack read more:

Answer a question with love, not fear.

With rhyme and sword, your home is near.

Both Jack and Annie were silent for a moment. “That’s a lot to do before nightfall,” Jack finally said.

“Yeah,” said Annie, “and I’m a little worried about the spider part.”

“And the ghost part,” said Jack.

“Hey,” said Annie, “if we’re going on another Merlin Mission, I’ll bet Teddy will come with us! He can help us get through the scary parts.”

“Right,” said Jack. Just hearing Teddy’s name made him feel braver.

“So,” said Annie. “Onward?” Onward was Teddy’s favorite word.

“Onward!” said Jack. He pointed to the handwriting on the pale blue shell. “I wish we could go to the time before Camelot!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. The Water Knight

A salty breeze blew into the tree house. Seagulls screeched overhead. Jack and Annie looked out the tree house window.

They were high in the branches of a gnarled old tree. The tree was on a sea cliff beneath snowcapped mountains. The mountains overlooked a rocky coast. There was no sign of human life anywhere.

“It looks wild and lonely here,” said Annie.

“Really lonely,” said Jack. “I wonder where Merlin and Teddy are.”



“I don’t know,” said Annie. “They were in the trunk of our tree last time. Let’s look for them in this one.” She climbed down the rope ladder.

Jack crammed the seashell in his pocket and followed her.

“Merlin?” Annie called. “Teddy?”

Jack and Annie circled the gnarled tree trunk, but there was no sign of an entrance into the magical chamber of Merlin the magician. They circled the tree again. Jack tapped the bark in several places.

“I have a feeling no one lives inside this tree,” said Annie.

“I think you’re right,” said Jack.

“Maybe they’re down by the water,” said Annie.

Annie and Jack walked a few feet to the edge of the sea cliff and looked down at the rugged coast. They saw three coves, separated from each other by rocky cliffs. The cliffs were filled with shadowy crags and the dark mouths of caves.

In the first cove, sunlit water flowed from the open sea through a small space between the cliffs, then washed onto a pebbly shore.

The second cove was smaller, but looked much like the first.

The third cove was different. The farthest away, it was surrounded by a ring of bright green hills. A thin white mist hung over its milky-green waters.

“I don’t see any sign of Merlin or Teddy,” said Jack. “I guess we’ll have to get started without them.”

“Read the beginning of Merlin’s rhyme again,” said Annie.

Jack took the shell from his pocket and read aloud:

Before night falls on this long summer day,

A shining sword must find its way

Into your hands and out of the gloom—

Or Camelot’s king shall meet his doom.

Jack looked up at the sky. The sun was almost directly overhead. “It must be around noon now,” he said.

“We don’t have much time,” said Annie. “What do we do first?”

Jack looked back at the rhyme and read aloud:

To begin your quest for this Sword of Light,

Call for the help of the Water Knight.

“Oh, easy,” said Annie.

“It is?” said Jack.

“Sure,” said Annie. “If he’s a Water Knight, he’s probably down by the water.” She started down the steep, rocky hill that led to the nearest cove.

Jack stuffed the shell back in his pocket. “But who is the Water Knight?” he yelled as he followed Annie.

“It doesn’t matter,” she yelled back. “We just have to go down to the water and call for his help.”

They climbed over large boulders toward the cove. The boulders were slippery, but Jack’s sneakers kept him from sliding. A damp breeze blew from the sea. It made his skin and clothes feel clammy.

When they got to the shore, Jack wiped the mist off his glasses and looked around. The wide beach was covered with silvery pebbles, shells, and rows of sea foam. Sandpipers and gulls picked at tangled ribbons of soggy seaweed.

“The tide must be out,” said Jack. He studied the cliffs above the cove. “I don’t know how a knight can get down here. A horse could never make it over all those rocks.”

“Let’s just do what the rhyme tells us,” said Annie, “and see what happens.”

Annie stretched out her arms. She closed her eyes. She raised her head toward the sky and shouted: “O Water Knight, whoever you are, come here and help Jack and Annie!”

“Oh, brother,” Jack muttered to himself.

Suddenly they heard the wild cries of seagulls. “Jack, look!” said Annie. She pointed toward the middle of the cove.

Seabirds were screeching and flapping above a giant swirl of spray and foam. The swirl was spinning just above the surface of the water, headed toward the beach!

“Wow!” said Annie. She took off running across the sand.

“Come back!” shouted Jack.

“No! Come look!” said Annie.

Jack hurried to the edge of the surf.

Through the blur of spinning spray and foam, he saw the silver helmet of a knight appear above the water. He saw silver breast armor. Then a strange creature burst through the surface, carrying the knight on its back.

The creature had a horse’s head and neck and front legs. But instead of back legs, it had a long, silvery fish’s tail! With the Water Knight on its back, the horse creature half galloped and half swam through the cove. Seagulls shrieked wildly overhead, following the pair toward the shore.

As the knight drew close to the edge of the water, he looked straight at Jack and Annie. He raised his gloved hand and beckoned to them.

“Okay, we’re coming!” cried Annie. She started pulling off her sneakers.

“Wait—let’s think about this!” cried Jack.

“We don’t have time!” said Annie. “He wants to help us. He’s like the stag that came for us in Camelot.”

“No, he isn’t,” said Jack. “He’s much weirder!”

But Annie tossed her sneakers onto the rocks and splashed through the shallow water. The knight held out his hand and helped her onto the strange horse creature. The creature slapped its fish’s tail against the water, sending up a fountain of spray.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie yelled. “We can’t waste time!”



Annie’s right, Jack thought. They had to find the Sword of Light before nightfall. He pulled off his sneakers and tossed them up onto the rocks near Annie’s. Then he stepped into the cold water and waded out to the knight.

Annie helped pull Jack up onto the horse creature. He sat on its scaly tail and clung to Annie while she held on tightly to the Water Knight’s tunic.

The silvery fish’s tail slapped the water. A shower of spray rained down on Jack. He closed his eyes. “Onward,” he said faintly.

The Water Knight turned away from the shore. With more slaps of its tail, the horse creature began galloping and swimming across the cove. The seagulls shrieked wildly as they swooped after them.

Bumping up and down, Jack clung desperately to Annie. He kept his eyes squeezed shut and tried hard not to fall off.

As they sped across the cove, the Water Knight guided his steed steadily over each ripple and wave. The bumpy ride soon turned into a smooth one.

“This is great!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. With the wind and spray whipping his face and hair, he began to feel more excited than scared.

“I’ll bet he’s taking us to the Sword of Light!” cried Annie. “We’ll be done with our mission in no time!”

That would be too easy, thought Jack. But as they sped over the waves, he grew hopeful. Maybe she’s right. Maybe it will be easy, he thought. Not all our missions have to be hard. But what about the rest of the stuff in the rhyme? What about—?

Before Jack could finish his thought, the strange horse creature stopped and reared up. Jack and Annie tumbled over its fish’s tail and splashed into the cold water.

They sank for a moment and then bobbed back up to the surface, frantically treading water. They looked up at the Water Knight and his horse.

The knight lifted his arm into the air. He pointed to a pile of boulders near the base of a nearby cliff. Then he spread the fingers of his gloved hand in a gesture of farewell.

“Bye! Thanks!” shouted Annie.

The horse creature slapped its fish’s tail and took off in a fountain of spray and foam. With the gulls circling above them, the mysterious pair whirled toward the passage between the cliffs that led out to the sea. In a moment, they vanished into the open water beyond.

3. Cave of the Spider Queen


Gentle waves rippled through the cove as Jack and Annie swam to the foot of the cliff. They pulled themselves onto the boulders. Soaking wet, they sat for a moment in the warm sunlight and caught their breath.

“That was so cool!” said Annie.

“Yeah. But why—” Jack gasped, “why did he dump us way out here? What do we do now?”

“Check the rhyme,” said Annie. “What happens after we call for the help of the Water Knight?”

Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the seashell. He read aloud:

Call for the help of the Water Knight.

Then pass through the Cave of the Spider Queen.

“Oh. Right,” said Annie. She took a deep breath. “Spider Queen.”

“Sorry,” Jack said softly. “But don’t worry, maybe the Spider Queen is just a person. Maybe ‘Spider Queen’ is her nickname.”

“But what if she’s half a person and half a spider?” said Annie. “Like the Raven King was half a man and half a raven?”

Jack shuddered at the memory of the monster on their last Merlin Mission. “Don’t think about that,” he said. “Time’s running out. Let’s just find this cave.”

Annie nodded and smiled bravely. “Okay, you’re right,” she said.

They stood up and started climbing barefoot around the craggy curves at the base of the cliff. As they rounded a corner, they both gasped.

In front of them was the mouth of a cave. The mouth was covered with thick, sticky white ropes. The ropes were woven tightly together in a crisscross cobweb pattern.

“If that’s a spiderweb, we’re in big trouble,” said Annie.

Jack tried to sound calm. “Um, the size of the web doesn’t actually tell us the size of the spider,” he said. “Plus, I once read that no spider on earth is bigger than a dinner plate.”

“Yeah, and no horse on earth has a giant fish’s tail either,” said Annie.

Good point, thought Jack. “Let’s just concentrate on finding the Sword of Light before nightfall,” he said.

Jack picked up a stone the size of a softball. He hurled it toward the mouth of the cave. The stone sailed through the giant cobweb and into the cave, pulling the sticky rope-like strands down with it.



Jack turned to Annie. “Ready?” he said.

She didn’t move.

Jack took her hand. “Don’t worry, I won’t let any monster spiders get you,” he said. He nodded toward the mouth of the cave. “Onward?”

“Onward,” Annie repeated in a small voice. Then together she and Jack stepped over the fallen web and entered the Cave of the Spider Queen.

Inside the cave, the walls were black and shiny. The ground was wet and slippery under their bare feet.

“Yikes!” Annie said, jumping back. A pale pink crab scuttled sideways across the rocky floor.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Jack. “That’s not a spider.”

“I know,” said Annie. “Sorry.”

As they went deeper and deeper into the cave, it grew darker and darker. Finally Jack saw a faint light coming from a wide, arched passage. “That way,” he said.

They stepped through the arch into a round chamber with a high ceiling. There were several large cracks in the ceiling that let in beams of sunlight. The misty light shined on mossy green ledges and on a green, spongy-looking floor. Silver droplets dripped from above, ker-plopping into tiny pools. Squeaks and chirps came from crannies and hiding places in the walls.

“What’s that noise?” asked Annie.

“Probably just teeny cave crickets or baby bats,” said Jack.

“No, that noise,” said Annie, “the whispering noise.”

Jack listened. Then he heard it: a low whispering. He couldn’t make out the words. It just sounded like whisper-whisper-whisper-whisper. The hair stood up on the back of his neck. Now he began to feel scared.

“This place is really creepy,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack. “But we don’t have to stay here long. The rhyme says we just have to pass through the cave. So let’s hurry and pass through it.”

Jack and Annie walked through the ghostly green light of the chamber. The spongy floor squished beneath their bare feet. As they searched for an exit from the cave, they both kept an eye out for the Spider Queen.

“Hey, look at the starfish,” said Annie. She pointed to a bright orange starfish clinging to the rocky ceiling. “How’d he get up there?”

Before Jack could answer, a wave crashed into the chamber. Water splashed over Jack and Annie.

“Yikes!” said Annie. She and Jack jumped onto a mossy ledge jutting out from the wall.

The wave washed back out. There was a moment of quiet. Then another wave surged into the chamber. It splashed against the cave walls, soaking Jack and Annie again.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “The tide must be coming in! Soon this whole cave will be flooded!”

The wave receded. For a moment all was quiet again.

“We’d better leave now!” said Jack. “Quick! Go back the way we came in!”



Jack and Annie jumped down from the ledge. But before they could escape, another wave crashed into the cave! This one swept them off their feet and pulled them down into the foamy water.

Jack grabbed Annie’s hand. Fighting the swirling current, they climbed back up onto the mossy ledge. The water churned and gurgled around the chamber.

“We can’t go back the way we came in,” said Jack. “The waves will just keep knocking us down, and we’ll get caught in the current!”

“Maybe we can get out through that crack!” cried Annie. She pointed to the widest crack in the cave ceiling. It was high above the swirling water.

“It’s too high!” said Jack. “We can’t get up there!” He looked frantically around the flooded cave, searching for another way out. Suddenly he froze in horror.

Clinging to a ledge near the ceiling crack was the Spider Queen. She had eight red glowing eyes. She had eight long, hairy legs. And she was much bigger than a dinner plate.

The Spider Queen was bigger than Jack.

4. Web Walk

Jack grabbed Annie’s hand. “Whatever you do, don’t look up,” he said.

Annie looked up.

“AHHHHH!” she screamed. She started to leap off the ledge into the churning waters. But then another wave crashed wildly against the walls.

Jack held Annie back. “Don’t jump!” he shouted. “You’ll drown!”

Above the sound of the rushing waters, a loud whisper echoed around the cave: Stay! Stay! Stay! The Spider Queen was staring down at them with her eight red eyes.

As Jack and Annie stared back in horror, the giant spider shot a web strand as thick as a rope straight toward them. Jack and Annie ducked. The strand stuck to the wall.

“What’s she doing?” cried Annie.

“I don’t know!” said Jack.

He and Annie looked back up at the Spider Queen. She’d crawled a few feet closer to the crack in the wall. She stared down at them for a moment with her glowing eyes, then shot out another thick rope strand.

“Watch out!” shouted Jack.

He and Annie ducked.

Thwack! The second web rope stuck to the ledge just a few feet away from the first.

“Oh, no! Look!” shrieked Annie. She pointed up at the cave ceiling.

The monster spider was zigzagging between the two strands of her web. She was heading straight toward them.

Jack and Annie screamed and pressed themselves against the wall. “We have to leave!” cried Annie. But before they could make a move, another wave crashed into the cave! The water swirled with ferocious force around the chamber.

“We can’t leave!” cried Jack.

“We can’t stay!” cried Annie.

Wait! Wait! Wait! whispered the Spider Queen.

The giant spider kept zigzagging between the two lines, spinning more web, coming closer and closer and closer to Jack and Annie.

They watched in horror, unable to speak or move. But just when she came close enough to touch them, the Spider Queen turned and scurried back up to the ceiling, leaving a giant web ladder behind her.

The Spider Queen stared down at Jack and Annie with her eight red eyes. Climb! Climb! Climb! she whispered from her spot on the ceiling.

“I think she wants to help us!” said Jack.

“No! She wants to trap us!” said Annie.

The spider whispered again: Climb! Climb! Climb!

Something about her voice made Jack feel certain the Spider Queen wanted to help. “She doesn’t want to hurt us!” he said. “She wants to help us escape! Besides, we don’t have any choice!”

The water was rising higher and higher over their ledge. It was swirling above their ankles now.

“We have to climb her web!” said Jack. “I’ll go first!”

He reached up and grabbed one of the spider ropes. It felt damp and sticky. He pulled himself onto the bottom strands of the web ladder.

“Grab on!” he shouted to Annie above the roar of the water. “We have to get to that crack in the ceiling!”

Annie grabbed one of the web ropes. “Eww!” she said. “It’s gross!”

“Just climb!” said Jack.

Holding tightly to the sticky strands, Jack and Annie began making their way up the Spider Queen’s web ladder. The web swayed and stretched, but it was sturdy enough to hold their weight. Its stickiness kept them from slipping and falling.

Crawling and climbing, they moved higher and higher above the crashing waters. As they drew near the crack in the ceiling, Jack kept his eyes on the Spider Queen. She was watching them carefully.

Finally Jack reached the ceiling crack. He swung to one side of the web ladder, putting himself between Annie and the giant spider.

“You go first,” he said.



“Okay,” said Annie. She grabbed the rocky edge of the opening and stuck her head out of the crack. “There’s nowhere to go but into the water!” she called.

“How far down is it?” said Jack.

“Pretty far!” said Annie. “But I think we can make it!”

“Wait—” said Jack.

But Annie was already squeezing herself through the crack.

“Annie, be careful!” said Jack.

Splash!

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He gripped the edge of the crack. Then he glanced back at the Spider Queen.

Her glowing red eyes peered out at him from the shadows. Go! Go! Go! she whispered.

Jack smiled at her. “Thanks!” he said.

Go! the Spider Queen whispered again.

Jack pulled himself out of the darkness onto a narrow rocky ledge. The bright sun sparkled on the blue water of the small cove below.

“Come on!” Annie shouted. She was bobbing up and down on the gentle waves.

Jack took off his glasses. He pinched his nose and closed his eyes. Then he jumped off the ledge.

5. Barrh! Barrh!

Jack splashed into the blue sunlit sea. He sank to the bottom and then bobbed back up. He coughed and pushed his hair out of his eyes.

Annie was treading water nearby. “Hey!” she called.

“Hey!” Jack sputtered.

“I was wrong! You were right!” Annie said. She sounded thrilled. “The Spider Queen just wanted to help us!”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He shook the seawater off his glasses and put them back on.

“She must be really lonely!” said Annie. “She probably feels like she has to hide in that cave because she’s so scary-looking!”

“Maybe,” said Jack. He looked around the second cove. Purple shadows stretched over a rocky seashore beneath the cliffs. The sun had moved farther across the sky.

“We’d better hurry!” said Jack. “What do we do now?”

“Read the rhyme!” said Annie.

Jack pulled the shell out of his pocket. Treading water, he read the next line in Merlin’s poem:

And swim with a selkie clothed in green.

“What’s a selkie?” said Annie.

“Who knows?” said Jack.

He looked at the cliffs and the shore. Is a selkie a fish? A person? What? he wondered. Then Jack saw two dark shapes speeding like fat torpedoes below the surface of the water. They were coming straight toward him and Annie.

“Watch out!” Jack shouted.

“Yikes!” Annie yelled.

Jack and Annie swam out of the way as the creatures moved swiftly past them. Suddenly two sleek gray heads popped above the surface. They had wide snouts and long white whiskers. They had tiny, wrinkly ears and big, dark eyes.

“Seals!” cried Annie.

The two seals turned their heads like periscopes. When they saw Jack and Annie, they opened their mouths, showing their small, pointed teeth. They seemed to be smiling.

“Hi, guys!” said Annie.

Barrh! Barrh! the seals barked. Then they rolled through the water and bumped Jack and Annie with their noses. They barked again joyfully, then darted toward the shore.

“Come on!” cried Annie. “Let’s play with them!”

“We don’t have time to play!” said Jack.

But Annie had already started after the seals, swimming toward the rocky beach.



“Annie! Stop!” called Jack. “We have to hurry and find the selkie! And the Sword of Light! Before nightfall! Or King Arthur will meet his doom ….” Jack’s voice trailed off.

Annie didn’t hear him. She and the two seals had reached the shore and were getting out of the water. The seals clumsily hauled their chubby bodies onto a big rock and flopped down. Annie climbed onto the rock, too.

“Annie, come on!” shouted Jack. It could be as late as four o’clock now, he thought. And there was still a lot they had to do before nightfall.

“Let’s rest for a minute!” Annie called. She sat near the seals and patted their shiny heads as if they were big dogs. The seals barked.

Actually, Jack wanted to rest, too. He felt really tired. Maybe we could rest for a minute on the rock with the seals, he thought, then search for the selkie.

“Well, okay,” he shouted. “But just for a quick minute!”

Jack headed for shore. By the time he dragged himself out of the water, the seals were lying on their backs with their eyes closed. Their white whiskers twitched as they slept in the warm sunlight.

“Shhh, they’re napping,” said Annie. She lay down beside the seals and closed her eyes, too. “The sun feels really good, Jack. Come on. Lie down with us for a second.”

“Oh, brother,” Jack muttered. But the afternoon sunlight did feel good. He climbed onto the warm rock and lay down next to Annie and the seals.

“Okay, just for a quick second,” he said.

Jack closed his eyes. The sunshine felt good on his tired arms and legs. The gentle sea breeze felt especially clean and fresh after the Cave of the Spider Queen. The next thing he knew, he had faded into a deep, peaceful sleep ….

6. The Selkie

“Wake up, lazybones! You can’t sleep all afternoon!” said a friendly voice.

Jack’s eyes shot open. Oh, no! he thought. What time is it? He sat up and looked around.

The seals were gone. Standing over Jack and Annie was a barefoot boy with a happy, freckled face.

“Teddy!” said Jack. For a moment he forgot all about the time.

“Teddy! Teddy!” cried Annie. She leaped up and hugged the young sorcerer.

Teddy grinned from ear to ear. He was wearing a brown tunic. His red hair was damp.

“You’re finally here!” said Jack, laughing.

“I have been here for some time,” said Teddy. “Merlin sent me early this morning. I was waiting for you on the beach when Kathleen came along and invited me to go for a swim with her.”

Teddy turned to a girl standing a little farther down the beach. Like Teddy, she looked to be about thirteen. “Kathleen!” he called. “Come meet my friends!”



The girl smiled and began walking over the rocks toward Jack, Annie, and Teddy. She wore a green dress that looked as if it had been woven from grass. Her hair fell in black ringlets down to her waist like a dark waterfall.

“These are my good friends Jack and Annie,” Teddy said to the girl. “They come from a faraway land.”

“Hello, Jack and Annie!” the girl said in a bold, friendly voice. “I am very happy to meet you! My name is Kathleen.” As she spoke, Kathleen’s large eyes sparkled with the blue of the sky and water.

Jack couldn’t speak. Kathleen was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen.

“I like your dress,” said Annie.

Kathleen laughed. “I wove it from sea grass,” she said. “I am not a very good weaver, I am sad to say.”

“Do you live here?” asked Annie.

“I do,” said Kathleen, “with my nineteen sisters.”

“Nineteen sisters!” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Kathleen, tossing back her long curls. “I am the youngest of us all. We live in a cave up in the cliffs.”

“Cool,” said Annie. “Is your cave like the Cave of the Spider Queen?”

“No, no,” said Kathleen. “It is much more cheerful than Morag’s cave.”

“So that’s her name,” said Annie. “I’m worried that she might be lonely.”

“Ah, do not worry,” said Kathleen. “Morag has many friends—bats, crabs, starfish. But it is kind of you to be concerned about her.” She smiled at Annie.

Kathleen’s friendly manner finally gave Jack the courage to speak. He cleared his throat. “The Water Knight was really cool, too,” he said.

“The Water Knight?” said Kathleen.

“Yeah,” he said, “the guy who carried us across the first cove.”

Kathleen looked puzzled.

“His horse had a fish’s tail!” said Annie.

“How strange,” said Kathleen. “I often swim in that cove, but I’ve never seen or heard of such a knight.”

“Have you lived here a long time?” asked Annie.

“Always,” said Kathleen.

“Kathleen is a selkie,” said Teddy.

“A selkie?” said Jack and Annie together.

“Yes,” said Kathleen, laughing.

“You’re in Merlin’s rhyme!” said Annie. “It says, Swim with a selkie clothed in green.”

“Merlin’s rhyme?” asked Teddy.

“Merlin gave us a rhyme to help us find the Sword of Light,” said Jack.

The smile left Kathleen’s face. Her beautiful eyes darkened. “You have come in search of the Sword of Light?” she said. “Oh, dear ….”

“What’s wrong?” said Jack.

“Many have passed through here seeking the Sword of Light,” said Kathleen. “But as soon as anyone enters the cove beyond the Jellyfish Cave, terrible winter storms seem to burst out of nowhere. Even in summer, the storms have icy winds and rain. No seekers of the sword have ever survived these gales.”

“Have you ever been to the cove beyond the Jellyfish Cave?” asked Jack.

Kathleen shook her head. “My older sisters have always forbidden me to go there,” she said. “In fact, no selkie has ever dared swim into the Cove of the Stormy Coast.”

“Cove of the Stormy Coast?” said Annie. “That’s the next line in Merlin’s rhyme! Enter the Cove of the Stormy Coast!”

“What is Merlin’s rhyme?” asked Teddy.

“Here,” said Jack. “Look.”

He handed the seashell to Teddy.

The boy sorcerer quickly read Merlin’s message and rhyme. Then he looked at the sky. “The sun moves on,” he said. “Let us make haste! We must find the sword before nightfall! Or someday Arthur will meet his doom!”



“Wait a minute,” said Annie. She looked at Kathleen. “The rhyme says we’re supposed to swim with you. Will you come with us?”

Kathleen looked at them for a long moment. Then she stood up and tossed back her curls. Her eyes were bright. “I have always wanted to explore that cove,” she said.

“Hurray!” said Teddy. “You will be the first selkie to do so! A grand adventure awaits us all! Onward!”

“Hold on,” said Jack. “What about that Jellyfish Cave?”

“You need not worry about the jellyfish,” said Kathleen. “They cannot harm us.”

“They cannot?” said Jack.

“No,” said the selkie, “not if we all change into seals.”

7. Cove of the Stormy Coast

“Seals?” asked Annie.

Jack looked at Teddy. “Did she say ‘change into seals’?” he asked.

“Indeed!” said Teddy. “That’s what selkies do. They are people on land and seals in the sea.”

“You’re a seal?” Jack asked Kathleen.

“Sometimes,” said the selkie, smiling.

Jack just stared at her. He couldn’t believe the beautiful girl was sometimes a seal.

“Whenever I come ashore and dry off in the sun, my seal skin falls away,” said Kathleen. “Then I am as human as—well, as I am right now.”

“Oh, I get it!” said Annie. “You were one of the seals we met in the water!”

“Of course,” said Kathleen, “and Teddy was the other.”

Jack looked at Teddy. “Y-you?” he stammered. “How … ?”

Teddy grinned. “I am a magician, remember?” he said.

Kathleen laughed. “Yes, but this time, ’twas my magic that did the work,” she said. She pointed to two shiny gray skins lying on the sand. “I gave him a seal skin and spoke a selkie spell.”

“You turned Teddy into a seal?” asked Jack.

“Aye,” said Kathleen, “and I shall do the same for you. I am sure my sisters will not mind if we borrow two more of their skins.” The selkie started toward a large pile of rocks.

Teddy watched Kathleen go, then looked back at Jack and Annie. “She has powerful magic indeed,” he said.

“No kidding,” said Annie.

Jack was speechless. He couldn’t believe he and Annie were about to become seals.

Kathleen came out from behind the rocks carrying two shiny skins. “Take these,” she said, handing them to Jack and Annie. The skins looked like scuba divers’ wet suits with hoods.

“Pull them on over your clothes,” said Kathleen. “Like this.” She and Teddy picked up their own seal skins from the sand and began pulling them on. Jack and Annie did the same.

Jack stretched the skin up over his legs and shorts, then over his arms and T-shirt. He felt as if he were wearing a thick layer of rubber.

“Before we cover our heads and faces, we must wade into the water,” said Kathleen. “Follow me.”

Jack waded clumsily into the water with the others. This is crazy, he thought. You can’t become a seal just by putting on a seal costume.

Kathleen stopped them when they were waist deep. “Slip on your hoods,” she said. “I will say a few words in selkie language. Then we shall all dive in.”

Teddy grinned at Jack and Annie. “We have flown together through the sky,” he said. “Now we shall swim together in the deep, eh?”

Jack nodded, but he still didn’t believe this could possibly work.

“Quickly!” said Kathleen. “Cover your heads and faces! Dive as soon as I’ve spoken the spell!”

Jack pulled on his hood. He stretched it down over his forehead, then over his face—his glasses, nose, and chin. He couldn’t see or talk. He wanted to rip the hood off, but Kathleen’s voice stopped him:

An-ca-da-tro-a-day-mee!

Ba-mi-hu-no-nay-hah-nee!

Jack heard one splash—then two more. He quickly dove into the sea.

As soon as the seawater covered his head and body, Jack felt the seal skin melt into his own. His chest expanded to the size of a barrel! His arms and legs vanished and flippers took their place!

Jack shot through the water like a torpedo.



When he moved his front flippers, he turned right or left. When he moved his back flippers, he zoomed forward.

Jack rolled and swerved in and out of schools of fish and jungles of sea grass. He dove down to the murky depths of the cove. Then he shot back up to the surface. In his smooth seal body, he could swim ten times faster than he ever had in his human body! And he could see and hear perfectly!

Jack rose and fell and rose and fell through the deep. Two seals appeared beside him. Bubbles came from their mouths. They made gurgling, clicking sounds. Jack could understand exactly what their seal sounds meant.

Hey, Jack! It’s me!

’Tis me, too!

Hi, guys! Jack called to Annie and Teddy. He heard trilling sounds on his other side. He saw a third seal. It was Kathleen, swimming gracefully toward him.

Hello, Jack!

Hello, Kathleen! Jack clicked back to her.

He wanted to tell the selkie how much fun he was having. But when he opened his mouth, a school of tiny fish swam down his throat. Before he knew it, Jack had swallowed all the fish whole! But he didn’t mind. He laughed a seal laugh full of bubbles.

Onward, Kathleen! clicked Teddy. Lead us to the Jellyfish Cave!

8. Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost


The four seals paddled with ease through the sunlit waters of the Selkie Cove and into the Jellyfish Cave. The water in the cave was cold and murky. But in his seal body, Jack was warm; and with his seal eyes, he could see clearly.

As they swam farther and farther into the cave, the jellyfish began to appear. At first there were just a few. Then there were hundreds … then thousands … pink jellyfish, purple jellyfish, orange and chocolate-colored jellyfish … jellyfish as big as umbrellas and as small as pennies … jellyfish shaped like bells, saucers, parachutes, mushrooms, cannonballs … jellyfish as bright as candle flames and jellyfish as clear as glass.



Some of the jellyfish pulsed in and out as they swam. Others silently drifted by, their long stinging tentacles trailing behind them. As Jack swam among the jellyfish, he wasn’t afraid at all. His tough seal skin protected him completely.

Finally Kathleen led Jack, Annie, and Teddy through a narrow passage of the cave and into the milky-green waters of the third cove.

The four seals poked their heads above the surface of the water and took deep gulps of air. Jack’s whiskers twitched as he looked around the Cove of the Stormy Coast.

The cove was completely silent. It was lit with a hazy, warm light. The water was flat calm, without a single ripple. Circling the cove were strange green hills that shimmered in the afternoon light. Snowcapped mountains loomed above the hills. Jack could see the tree with the magic tree house on a distant sea cliff.

Climb onto those rocks and dry off! Kathleen barked.

They all swam to a small rocky island in the middle of the cove. Jack hoisted his blubbery, tear-shaped body out of the water. He flopped beside the others and puffed and groaned. The seal body that had felt so graceful underwater now felt heavy and awkward.

Jack’s skin began to feel tighter and tighter in the sunlight. Almost before he knew it, the skin had slipped from his body like old wrapping paper. He was human again—lying on the rock in his shorts and T-shirt. He sat up and pushed his glasses into place.

“That was great!” said Annie.

Jack looked at her. The same magic had happened to Annie and the others. They were all human again.

“Yeah, it was,” Jack said happily. He looked around. “And I don’t see any signs of a winter storm here.”

“No, but still, I do not like the looks of this place,” said Teddy. The boy sorcerer frowned as he peered around at the cove. “It gives me the quivers.”

Jack glanced anxiously at Teddy. If Teddy was afraid, something must be wrong. Teddy never acted as if he were afraid of anything.

“Well, the day wears on,” Teddy said, looking up at the sinking sun. “Let us hurry ashore to find the sword, so we can leave this cove as quickly as possible.”

“I fear our search may be difficult,” said Kathleen. “Look.”

A dense gray fog was rolling down from the mountains. As they watched, the fog hid the sea cliff where their tree house had landed. Within moments, the fog had completely covered the green hills. Then it swept over the windless waters of the cove.

“Oh, dear,” said Kathleen. “The Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost is upon us.”

“The Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost?” asked Annie.

“Aye, that’s what we selkies call a very thick fog,” said Kathleen.

“And that’s a line in Merlin’s rhyme!” said Annie. “Dive ’neath the Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost!”

Jack breathed a sigh of relief. “Gray Ghost” wasn’t a ghost at all! It was just another name for fog. “So I guess we just go ashore and look for the sword under the fog somewhere,” he said.

“The rhyme says we dive,” said Teddy. “So perhaps we do not go ashore at all.”

“Oh, right,” said Jack. “Does that mean we get to turn back into seals?” Shivering in the cold fog, he was eager to slip back into his warm, protective seal body.

“I fear we cannot all be seals,” Kathleen said, “for how could we grasp a heavy sword with our flippers?”

“You and Teddy be the seals, then, and look for the sword,” said Annie. “Jack and I can swim down and grab it after you show us where it is.”

Jack was about to say he’d rather be a seal. But before he could speak, Teddy piped up. “Excellent plan!” he said.

“Indeed,” said Kathleen. “Your friends are very brave.” She turned and smiled warmly at Jack.

“Uh, sure, no problem,” he said.

“Let us make haste,” said Teddy. Hidden by the fog, he and Kathleen pulled their seal skins back on. A moment later, Jack heard Teddy call out, “Farewell, friends!” Then Kathleen spoke her selkie spell. Her words were followed by two splashes.



“What do we do now?” Jack asked.

“We wait for them to find the sword,” said Annie.

“I hope they hurry,” said Jack, shivering.

“Me too,” said Annie.

They listened for the barking of the seals. They listened and listened … .

“I wonder what time it is,” said Annie.

“Impossible to tell,” said Jack.

“They’d better—”

“Shh!” said Jack.

He heard a faint seal bark, then another and another. But in the thick fog, he couldn’t tell where the barks were coming from. “Where are they?” he said.

“I think they’re over there!” said Annie.

Splash! Annie had jumped in. Jack couldn’t see her in the fog.

“Annie, where are you?” he shouted.

“Here!” Annie yelled through the ghostly mist. “Come on!”

Jack put his glasses down on the rocks. Then he slowly lowered himself into the water. As he started after Annie, his human body felt thin and frail compared to his powerful seal body. He couldn’t swim nearly as fast. He couldn’t hold his breath underwater for nearly as long. And he was freezing cold.

The seal barks grew louder and louder. Barrh! Barrh!

Jack didn’t see their two friends until he nearly bumped into them. Teddy and Kathleen were swimming in a tight circle, barking excitedly.

“Did you find the sword?” Annie shouted at them. “Is it here?”

The seals barked and dove under the water. Jack and Annie took deep breaths and followed.

The seals swam quickly to the sandy bottom of the cove. They circled a shimmering object sticking out of the sand.

It was the golden handle of a sword.

9. The Sword of Light

Annie pointed to the sword handle. Jack nodded. But he was running out of air. He swam back up to the surface. Annie followed him.

Their heads bobbed above the water, and they gasped. “Did you see it?” cried Annie. “The handle of the sword?”

“Yes! The blade must be buried in the sand!” said Jack.

“We have to pull it out!” said Annie. “And we have to hurry!”

“Right!” said Jack.

He and Annie took giant gulps of air. Then they swam back down to the bottom of the cove. Jack got to the sword first. He grabbed the handle and pulled. The sword didn’t budge. He pulled again. The sword still didn’t move.

Annie grabbed one side of the handle. She and Jack pulled together. Jack felt the sword move a tiny bit. His lungs felt like they were about to burst.

Gripping his side of the handle with both hands, Jack pulled with all his might. Suddenly the flashing blade slipped out of the sand!



Jack and Annie carried the sword up through the water as fast as they could. They burst into the air, clinging to the Sword of Light and gasping for air.

“We got it!” Jack called to Kathleen and Teddy.

The seals circled around them, splashing and barking joyfully.

Barrh! Barrh!

“Lead us to the rocks!” Annie shouted.

Jack and Annie each held on to the sword’s handle with one hand. Paddling with their free hands, they dragged the sword after the seals.

As they swam, the fog began to lift, and the sky turned from gray to blue. By the time they reached the rocky island, light from the late-afternoon sun was again glinting off the strange green shoreline.

“Hold the sword while I get out!” Jack shouted to Annie.

Jack climbed onto the rocky island. He took the sword from Annie, then carefully pulled it up onto the rocks and laid it on its side.

Annie climbed out of the water. Nearby, Teddy and Kathleen poked up their seal heads. They were all silent as they stared in wonder at the sword.

“Wow,” breathed Annie.

Jack nodded. The mighty sword reflected the burning light of the setting sun. Its blade glowed as if it, too, were on fire.

“Now what do we do?” Jack said.

“We have to get the sword to Merlin fast,” said Annie. “The sun’s about to go down.”

“Right,” said Jack. “Before nightfall. Right.”

Suddenly Teddy and Kathleen barked a warning. Jack and Annie looked up.

The water had begun to ripple. The ripples started at the edge of the cove and swelled toward the center. Waves crashed against the small rocky island, sending up great showers of spray.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“Maybe a bad storm’s coming!” said Annie.

Barrh! Barrh! Kathleen and Teddy tried to haul themselves onto the rock, but the waves pushed them away.

“We’ve got to help them!” said Annie. She and Jack tried to help the seals out of the rough water. Their hands slipped over the sleek seal skin, and they nearly toppled into the water themselves.

The waves kept rolling and splashing. Barrh! Barrh! The two seals were swept away from the rocky island.

“Look!” cried Annie. “The land is moving!”

Jack looked at the strange green shoreline surrounding the cove. It was moving! It shifted from side to side, then slithered forward!

A great roaring noise rocked the cove. A monstrous head rose above the surface of the water.

The green hills were not hills at all. They were the coils of a giant sea serpent’s body!

10. The Ancient Question

“AHHH!” screamed Jack and Annie.

The giant sea serpent arched its long neck into the sky. Its scaly green skin glistened in the late sunlight. Staring at Jack and Annie, its eyes burned like bright yellow lamps.

Jack and Annie were frozen with terror.

The monster opened its mouth. Inside were hideous fangs and a purple forked tongue. The serpent made a terrible hissing sound!

Jack and Annie huddled together on the rock. Frantic seal barks came from far away.

“Teddy!” yelled Jack. “Kathleen!”

“Their magic can’t help us now!” cried Annie. “They’re stuck in their seal—”

Before she could finish, the sea serpent’s deep voice boomed through the cove: “WHO ARE YOU? AND WHY ARE YOU SSSTEALING THE SSSWORD OF LIGHT?”

Jack was too stunned to answer. But Annie shouted back at the monster. “We’re Jack and Annie! We’re on a mission for Merlin!”

“SSSSSSSSS!” the serpent hissed angrily. Its purple tongue flicked as it coiled its body around the rocky island. Then the monster arched its neck and lowered its huge head.

Again, the ancient voice boomed through the cove: “TO BE WORTHY OF THE SSSWORD, YOU MUSSST ANSSSWER THE QUESSSTION OF THE SSSWORD.”

“What is the question?” shouted Annie.

“SSSSSSSSS!” hissed the serpent. It turned away and circled the rocks again. Soon its scaly green body was coiled twice around the little rocky island.

It’s going to crush us! Jack thought with horror. Maybe they had strength enough to stab the monster before it squashed them. “Pick up the sword!” he shouted at Annie.

Together Jack and Annie lifted the mighty sword. They gripped its handle and pointed the gleaming blade at the sea serpent.

“Don’t come any closer!” Jack yelled.

The serpent came closer. Its eyes flashed. Its forked tongue darted in and out. It opened its mouth wide.

“Wait! Stop!” Annie shouted at the sea serpent. “Give us a chance! Ask us the question!”

The serpent closed its mouth. Then it arched its neck, and its huge head dipped down right in front of Jack and Annie. In a low, deep voice, it said, “WHAT ISSS THE PURPOSSSE OF THE SSSWORD? THAT ISSS THE ANCIENT QUESSSTION.”



“Okay! The purpose of the sword! Just a minute!” shouted Annie. She turned to Jack. “What is the purpose of the sword?” she asked.

“To defeat your enemies?” Jack said.

Annie shook her head. “That doesn’t sound right.”

“To force them to give up?” Jack said. “To slay them?”

“No, I’m sure that’s not right,” said Annie.

“SSSSSSSSS!” the serpent hissed at them impatiently.

“Then what?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie, “but maybe—maybe it’s not about fighting at all! Look at it!”

Jack stared at the gleaming sword. Its silver blade glowed against the red sunset sky. Staring at the wondrous sword, Jack felt calmer. A strange sense of joy and relief came over him.

“ANSSSWER THE QUESSSTION!” the serpent boomed.

Jack’s mind became clear. “I think I’ve got it,” he said. “Remember the line from Merlin’s rhyme? Answer a question with love, not fear.”

“Yes!” said Annie. “That’s it! It’s not about fighting! It’s about not being afraid!”

“ANSSSWER THE QUESSSTION!” the serpent boomed.

Jack looked up at the serpent’s face. As he stared deep into its yellow eyes, he no longer felt any fear. It was the serpent who seemed afraid now.

“The sword should not be used to harm anyone or anything!” Jack shouted.

“That’s right!” said Annie. “It should be used for good only!”

The serpent stopped swaying. It flicked its tongue.

“The sword should not make people afraid!” said Jack. “It should help take away their fear! If they’re not afraid, they’ll stop fighting!”

The serpent was very still.

“The purpose of the sword is not fighting!” Jack shouted. “The purpose of the sword is peace!”

11. Sword and Rhyme

The sea serpent moved its head very close to Jack and Annie and hissed a long, whispery sssssssss.

The serpent’s flicking tongue touched the sword for a moment. Jack’s heart nearly stopped. But then the serpent slowly pulled back its head and began to uncoil itself from around the rocky island.

The monster kept uncoiling its great body, until once again one wide ring surrounded the cove like a circle of green hills. Then the serpent’s head sank beneath the water with barely a ripple. It was impossible to tell where its body started and where it ended.

Jack and Annie lowered the Sword of Light and laid it back on the rock. Then they let out a huge sigh of relief and sat down next to the sword.

Kathleen and Teddy poked their seal heads up from the calm waters. Barrh! Barrh! they barked.

Jack and Annie laughed. “It’s safe to come out now!” Annie called.

The seals hauled themselves onto the rocky island. Then they plopped on their sides.

“The sword helped us answer the ancient question,” said Jack.

They all looked at the Sword of Light. It glowed brightly, even though the sun had slipped below the horizon and the purple sky was fading into twilight.

“We still have to get it out of here before it’s completely dark,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. “But how?”

“Look at Merlin’s rhyme,” said Annie.

Jack took the shell from his pocket. He read the last line of Merlin’s rhyme:

With rhyme and sword, your home is near.

Jack looked up. “That doesn’t make sense,” he said.

“Perhaps it does,” said Teddy.

Jack and Annie turned around. Teddy and Kathleen were standing behind them. Their seal skins had silently slipped off. They were human again.

“Perhaps it calls for a magical rhyme,” said Teddy. “And I am a magician, remember?”

Annie laughed. “How could we forget?” she said.

Teddy grinned. “I have gotten much better at my rhymes,” he said. “Just watch.” He rubbed his hands together. Then he carefully picked up the Sword of Light. He gripped its handle with both hands. He pointed the silver blade toward the tree house on the distant sea cliff.

Teddy took a deep breath. Then he shouted:

O Sword of Light, now light the night!

Teddy paused. Jack grew worried. Teddy always had trouble finishing his rhymes. And even the ones he did finish never worked the way they were supposed to.

Kathleen stepped close to the young sorcerer. “Say it again,” she said softly.

Teddy called out again:

O Sword of Light, now light the night!

Kathleen finished the rhyme in selkie language:

Ma-ee-bree-stro-eh-brite!

The sword began to vibrate in Teddy’s hands. There was a roar and a blast of white light. Shimmering beams shot through the dark. The beams wiggled and waved, then streamed together to make a glittering bridge.

The bridge spanned the purple darkness of dusk. It stretched from the rocky island in the middle of the cove to the sea cliff above the coast. When Teddy lowered the sword, the bridge remained in the sky.

“Wow!” whispered Annie. She turned to Kathleen. “What did you say to finish the rhyme?”

“Ma-ee-bree-stro-eh-brite,” Kathleen told her. “Make a bridge, strong and bright.”

“Yes, that is exactly what I was going to say,” said Teddy.

“Indeed,” said Kathleen, smiling. She took Teddy’s hand, then turned to Jack and Annie. “ ’Tis a bright bridge to take you from my world back to yours.”

“You mean—we can walk on it?” said Annie.

“Try it,” said Teddy.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He laughed nervously. Then he raised his foot and put it down on the light. It felt solid. He put his other foot on the light and took a step forward. The light felt as firm as a brick pathway.



Annie stepped onto the light bridge beside Jack. It was wide enough for them to stand side by side. “This is so cool,” she whispered.

“Wait, do not forget this,” said Teddy. He carefully handed Jack and Annie the Sword of Light.

Together they gripped the handle of the sword. “What about you guys?” asked Jack.

“I must return to my cave now,” said Kathleen, “or my sisters will begin to worry.”

“And I will see Kathleen back home,” said Teddy, “then return to the future in Camelot.”

“After you stay for supper with me and my sisters,” Kathleen reminded Teddy.

“Oh … ,” said Jack. He wanted to have supper with the selkies, too. He wanted to spend more time with Kathleen and Teddy, whatever they were doing.

“We’d better get going, Jack,” said Annie. “It’s almost dark.”

“Okay,” said Jack.

“Good-bye for now,” Kathleen said to them. “And thank you. ’Tis amazing how you defeated the enemy.”

“The sea serpent wasn’t really our enemy,” said Jack.

“He was like the Spider Queen,” said Annie. “They both seemed really scary until we got to know them.”

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“Will we see you again?” Annie asked Teddy and Kathleen.

“Yes, I have a feeling you will see both of us again soon,” said the selkie.

“We will find you when you least expect it,” said Teddy with a grin. “Now, my friends, you must go. Night comes quickly upon you. Farewell.”

“Farewell,” said Jack and Annie. They turned and started walking up the bright bridge. High above the water, the sword’s light swung over the cove like a swaying lantern. The water below shimmered with sparkling ripples.

Jack heard two splashes behind them. He stopped and listened.

“Go, go, go,” whispered Annie.

Jack started walking again. He and Annie climbed higher and higher, until they came to the end of the bright pathway.

They stepped off the bridge onto the rocky sea cliff above the coves. Clutching the handle of the sword, they looked back.

The shining bridge shattered into a million pieces of golden light. Like the sparks of a firecracker, the glittering pieces rained down through the sky. Then they quickly burned out.

The cove below was dark and silent—except for the distant barking of seals.

12. The Isle of Avalon

“Now what?” Jack asked.

“Now I thank you,” said a deep voice.

“Merlin!” cried Annie.

Merlin stepped out of the shadows. He wore his red magician’s cloak. His long white beard shined in the radiant glow of the sword.

“You brought the Sword of Light out of the gloom just in time,” he said, “before nightfall on the summer solstice.”

“Why did we have to get it on the summer solstice?” said Jack.

“That is the day when the powers of the Ice Wizard of Winter are weakest,” said Merlin.

“The Ice Wizard of Winter?” said Annie. “Does the sword belong to him? Did we just steal it from him?”

“No,” said Merlin. “Long ago, the Ice Wizard stole the sword from the Lady of the Lake and brought it to his kingdom high above the North Sea.” Merlin pointed to the snowcapped mountains beyond the rocky coast.

“The wizard soon discovered that the Sword of Light was useless to him, for the Lady of the Lake had placed a spell upon it that made it powerful only in the hands of worthy mortals. Still, the wizard refused to part with it. He buried it at the bottom of the cove.”

“The Cove of the Stormy Coast,” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Merlin. “Only recently did the seabirds tell me of the sword’s whereabouts. I knew I needed worthy mortals to retrieve it. So I sent for you on the summer solstice, when the Ice Wizard could send no mighty storms to keep you from finding it. He could only throw the ‘Cloak of the Old Gray Ghost’ over you.”

“So the Ice Wizard sent the fog,” said Annie.

“And did he put the sea monster in the cove, too?” asked Jack.

Merlin smiled. “No. The serpent serves the Lady of the Lake. Long ago, he secretly took it upon himself to find the sword and guard it. Should any mortals survive the wizard’s storms and gales, they still had to prove themselves worthy by answering the serpent’s question. I believed you two would be able to answer the question wisely. And I was right.”

“Your rhyme helped,” said Jack.

He and Annie carefully handed the Sword of Light to Merlin.

“Will you put this sword in a stone now?” asked Annie. “So Arthur can pull it out someday and become king?”

“No, this sword is even more powerful than the sword in the stone,” said Merlin. “This sword has a name—Excalibur.”

“Excalibur!” said Jack and Annie.

“I will take it back to the Isle of Avalon now,” said Merlin, “and return it to the Lady of the Lake. Someday after Arthur is king, she will give it to him. The sword will help him face many challenges bravely and wisely. He will—”

Merlin was interrupted by a strange sound from the water below. It sounded like the deep bellow of a foghorn.

“What was that?” said Jack.

“Ah, yes, there is one last thing to do,” said Merlin. He raised the sword and pointed it toward the Cove of the Stormy Coast. Like the beam of a giant searchlight, the sword’s light streamed over the black waters.

Merlin moved the beam back and forth, as if he were looking for something. “Ah,” he said. “There he is.”



The light revealed the gigantic head of the sea serpent. Its yellow lamp-like eyes shined back at them.

“He mourns now,” said Merlin, “for he has lost his purpose for being here. ’Tis time we help him home to the waters of Avalon.”

The magician lifted the sword slightly. The beam made a path to show the monster the passage out of the cove. The giant serpent slid through the water and soon disappeared beneath the waves of the dark summer sea.

“His mission is done now,” said Annie.

“Yes, and so is yours, my friends,” said Merlin. “You must climb the ladder to your tree house and go home.”

By the light of the sword, Jack and Annie found their way to the rope ladder and climbed up into the tree house. When they looked out the window, they saw Merlin standing in the glow of the Sword of Light.

“Bye!” Jack and Annie called.



The magician raised his arm and spread his fingers in a wave of farewell. Merlin’s gesture stirred something in Jack’s memory, but he wasn’t sure what it was.

“Let’s go now,” Annie said.

Jack took the seashell out of his pocket. He pointed to the words Frog Creek. “I wish we could go home!” he said.

“Wait!” said Annie. “Our shoes! We left them on the beach!”

Too late.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.




Jack opened his eyes. A warm summer breeze wafted into the tree house. The noon sun shined between the tree leaves. No time at all had passed in Frog Creek.

“Merlin was the Water Knight,” Jack said.

“What?” said Annie.

“When he said good-bye, Merlin gave us the same wave the Water Knight gave us,” said Jack. “Remember?” Jack raised his hand and imitated Merlin’s gesture.

“You’re right!” Annie laughed. “Why didn’t I think of that? He always helps us get started on our missions.”

“And now we have three things from him,” said Jack. He put the pale blue shell on the floor next to the Royal Invitation and the yellow autumn leaf. Then he looked at Annie.

“Home?” he said.

She nodded.

They climbed down the rope ladder and started walking barefoot through the damp, leafy woods.

“I guess we’ll just have to tell Mom we lost our shoes in a time before Camelot,” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie, “on our way to get the Sword of Light that was stolen by the Ice Wizard of Winter and guarded by a giant sea serpent who served the Lady of the Lake.”

“Right,” said Jack. “A simple explanation.”

“You ready to go swimming at the lake now?” asked Annie.

Jack remembered the thrill of being a seal and zooming through the deep waters. “It won’t be the same without Kathleen and Teddy,” he said. “We won’t be seals.”

“We can pretend,” said Annie. “Let’s hurry before Mom decides it’s too late to go.”

They took off running. They ran barefoot through the woods, over sticks and leaves, through the dappled noon light. Then they ran down their street. They were out of breath by the time they reached their yard.

“Oh, wow!” said Annie. “Look!” She pointed at their porch.

Sitting in front of the door were their sneakers.

Jack and Annie climbed the porch and picked up their shoes. As Jack turned his over, fine white sand fell out—and a couple of tiny silver pebbles.

“Who—how?” he said.

A seagull screeched overhead. They looked up. The gull screeched again, then flew away and disappeared into the soft summer light.

Annie shrugged. “A little leftover magic,” she said. Then she called through the screen door, “Mom! We’re ready!”

A Note from the Author


Once again, details of old stories from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and England have inspired a Magic Tree House Merlin Mission. While researching Summer of the Sea Serpent, I read about mythical creatures known as selkies, who were said to dwell in the inlets and bays of the British Isles. Selkies were “seal people” who took human shape whenever they slipped off their seal skins. In several old tales, female selkies marry fishermen and cause great heartache when they return to their seal lives.

Many Celtic tales also tell of water horses that live in Scottish lakes and of the legendary Gray Man, a bearded giant who spreads his fog cloak over lonely Scottish and Irish coasts.

Stories of giant sea serpents appear in tales from all over the world, from ancient Greece and Europe to India and Asia. Long ago, when the ocean was a realm of mysteries and marvels, many sailors and fishermen reported seeing long-necked, snaky monsters swimming in the deep. It’s likely that they mistook giant squid, sea turtles, or whales for these sea monsters.

And of course, while working on this book, I was again inspired by the tales of King Arthur and Camelot, which have been told again and again over the centuries. For instance, my sword bridge was inspired by a sword bridge in the French tale “Lancelot,” in which the knight has to cross a bridge created by a magic sword to reach the Isle of Glass.

In many versions of the tales of Camelot, Arthur is given the mighty sword Excalibur by the Lady of the Lake, who lives on the Isle of Avalon. The sword’s name may come from the Latin word chalybs, which means “steel.” Some sources indicate that Excalibur was also known as the “Sword of Light.”

A cold wind rattled the windowpanes. But inside the house, it was warm and cozy. Jack and Annie were making Christmas cookies with their mom. Jack pressed a star-shaped cookie cutter into the dough.

“Hey, it’s snowing outside,” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. Huge snow-flakes were falling from the late-afternoon sky.

“You want to go out?” asked Annie.

“Not really. It’ll be dark soon,” said Jack.

“That’s right,” said their mom. “Today’s the first day of winter. It’s the shortest day of the year.”

Jack’s heart skipped a beat. “You mean it’s the winter solstice?” he said.

“Yes,” said their mom.

Annie gasped. “The winter solstice?” she said.

“Yes … ,” their mom said, puzzled.

Jack and Annie looked at each other. Last summer, Merlin the magician had called for their help on the summer solstice. Maybe he would need them again today!

Jack put down the cookie cutter and wiped his hands on a towel. “Actually, Mom, it might be fun to play in the snow for just a few minutes,” he said.

“Whatever you want,” their mom said. “Just dress warmly. I’ll finish up with the cookies and put them in the oven.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He and Annie raced to the closet and pulled on their boots. They threw on jackets, scarves, gloves, and caps.

“Be home before dark,” their mom said.

“We will!” called Jack.

“Bye, Mom!” Annie shouted.

Jack and Annie slipped out of their house into the snowy cold. Their boots squeaked as they ran across their white yard and headed toward the Frog Creek woods.

At the edge of the woods, Jack stopped. He couldn’t believe how beautiful the trees looked. White powder covered the branches of the hemlocks and pines.

“Look,” said Annie. She pointed to two pairs of footprints that led out to the road and then back into the woods. “Somebody else has been here.”

“It looks like they were walking out of the woods—but turned back,” said Jack. “Let’s hurry!” If the magic tree house had come back today, he didn’t want anyone else finding it first!

Jack and Annie walked quickly through the woods, following the two sets of footprints.



“Stop!” said Annie. She pulled Jack behind a tree. “Over there!”



Through the falling snow, Jack saw two people in long, dark cloaks. They were hurrying toward a tall oak—and high in the oak was the magic tree house!

“Oh, no!” said Jack.

The tree house was back! And someone else had found it!

“Hey!” Jack yelled. “Stop!” The tree house had come for him and Annie—no one else!

Jack started running. Annie followed. Jack slipped and fell in the snow, but he scrambled up and kept going. By the time he and Annie got to the tree house, the two people had climbed up the rope ladder and disappeared inside.

“Come out!” Jack yelled.

“This is our tree house!” shouted Annie.

Two kids poked their heads out of the tree house window. They both looked like they were about thirteen years old. The boy had tousled red hair and freckles. The girl had sea-blue eyes and long, curly black hair. Their cheeks were rosy from the cold. They laughed when they saw Jack and Annie.

“Excellent!” said the boy. “We came to find you, but you have found us instead.”

“Teddy!” cried Annie. “Kathleen! Hi!”

Teddy was the young sorcerer who worked with Morgan in her library in Camelot. Kathleen was the enchanted selkie girl who’d helped Jack and Annie on the summer solstice by magically turning them all into seals.

Jack was stunned. He had never imagined that their two friends from Camelot might someday visit Frog Creek! “What are you guys doing here?” he shouted.

“Climb up and we will tell you!” said Teddy.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, Annie threw her arms around Teddy and Kathleen. “I can’t believe you came to visit us!” she said.

“It pleases me to see you, Annie,” said Kathleen. “And you also, Jack.” Her large blue eyes sparkled.

“It pleases me, too,” Jack said shyly. He still thought Kathleen was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. Even when she’d been a seal, she’d been lovely.

“We went looking for you!” said Teddy. “We climbed down and walked through the woods to a road.”

“But the road was full of monsters!” said Kathleen. “A big red creature nearly ran over us! It made a honking sound!”

“Then before we knew it, a giant black monster charged at us! It had a ferocious growl!” said Teddy. “We came back here to gather our wits.”

“Those weren’t monsters!” said Annie, laughing. “They were just cars!”

“Cars?” said Teddy.

“Yeah, they have motors and people drive them,” said Jack.

“Motors?” said Teddy.

“It’s hard to explain,” said Annie. “Just remember—in our world, you have to watch out for cars every time you cross a road.”

“Indeed we will,” said Teddy.

“Why have you come here?” asked Jack.

“We found a message for you in Merlin’s chambers,” said Teddy, “and decided to deliver it ourselves.”

“So we climbed into the tree house outside Morgan’s library,” said Kathleen. “Teddy pointed to the words Frog Creek in the message and made a wish to come here. The next thing we knew, we were here in these woods.”

Teddy pulled a small gray stone from his cloak. “And this is the message we brought you,” he said.

Jack took the stone from Teddy.

The message was written in tiny handwriting. Jack read it aloud:



“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “That sounds serious.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But why didn’t Merlin send us the message himself?”

“We do not know,” said Teddy. “Neither Merlin nor Morgan has been seen for days.”

“Where did they go?” asked Annie.

“’Tis a mystery,” said Teddy. “Last week I journeyed to the selkie cove to bring Kathleen to Camelot. She is going to be a helper in Morgan’s library. But when we returned, we could not find Merlin or Morgan.”

“We only found this message for you,” said Kathleen.

“Aye, and I thought that when Merlin does return,” said Teddy, “he will be greatly pleased to have his staff back. Much of his power comes from its ancient and mysterious magic.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“In his message, he tells us to go to the Land-Behind-the-Clouds,” said Jack. “Where’s that?”

“’Tis a land far north of my cove,” said Kathleen. “I have never journeyed there.”

“Nor I,” said Teddy. “But I have read about it in Morgan’s books. ’Tis as bleak as a frozen white desert. I am eager to see it for myself.”

“So you and Kathleen are coming with us?” said Annie.

“Indeed!” said Kathleen.

“Great!” said Jack and Annie together.

“If we all work together, we can do anything, aye?” said Teddy.

“Aye!” said Annie.

I hope so, thought Jack.

Annie pointed at the words Land-Behind-the-Clouds in Merlin’s message. “Okay, ready?” she said to the others.

“Yes!” said Kathleen.

“I guess so,” said Jack.

“Onward!” said Teddy.

“I wish we could all go there!” Annie said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Wizard of Wondrous Art





Dear Reader,





Winter of the Ice Wizard is the fourth “Merlin Mission” in the Magic Tree House series. In these books, Merlin the magician sends Jack and Annie on their tree house adventures to mythical lands.

In the first Merlin Mission, Christmas in Camelot, Jack and Annie journey to the Otherworld to find a magical cauldron that holds the Water of Memory and Imagination. Then in Haunted Castle on Hallows Eve, they rescue the stolen Diamond of Destiny with the help of their friend Teddy. In Summer of the Sea Serpent, Jack and Annie travel to an enchanted seacoast, where they find the hidden Sword of Light with Teddy and a seal girl named Kathleen.

Now, on the first day of winter, Jack and Annie are about to head out on another magical mission. They invite you to join them. But be sure to wear warm clothes and snow boots. You’re going to a very cold land where very weird things happen.…





The fetters shall break

And the wolf run free.

Secret things I know

And onward see.

—From The Poetic Edda


1. Winter Solstice



A cold wind rattled the windowpanes. But inside the house, it was warm and cozy. Jack and Annie were making Christmas cookies with their mom. Jack pressed a star-shaped cookie cutter into the dough.

“Hey, it’s snowing outside,” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. Huge snow-flakes were falling from the late-afternoon sky.

“You want to go out?” asked Annie.

“Not really. It’ll be dark soon,” said Jack.

“That’s right,” said their mom. “Today’s the first day of winter. It’s the shortest day of the year.”

Jack’s heart skipped a beat. “You mean it’s the winter solstice?” he said.

“Yes,” said their mom.

Annie gasped. “The winter solstice?” she said.

“Yes … ,” their mom said, puzzled.

Jack and Annie looked at each other. Last summer, Merlin the magician had called for their help on the summer solstice. Maybe he would need them again today!

Jack put down the cookie cutter and wiped his hands on a towel. “Actually, Mom, it might be fun to play in the snow for just a few minutes,” he said.

“Whatever you want,” their mom said. “Just dress warmly. I’ll finish up with the cookies and put them in the oven.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He and Annie raced to the closet and pulled on their boots. They threw on jackets, scarves, gloves, and caps.

“Be home before dark,” their mom said.

“We will!” called Jack.

“Bye, Mom!” Annie shouted.

Jack and Annie slipped out of their house into the snowy cold. Their boots squeaked as they ran across their white yard and headed toward the Frog Creek woods.

At the edge of the woods, Jack stopped. He couldn’t believe how beautiful the trees looked. White powder covered the branches of the hemlocks and pines.

“Look,” said Annie. She pointed to two pairs of footprints that led out to the road and then back into the woods. “Somebody else has been here.”

“It looks like they were walking out of the woods—but turned back,” said Jack. “Let’s hurry!” If the magic tree house had come back today, he didn’t want anyone else finding it first!

Jack and Annie walked quickly through the woods, following the two sets of footprints.

“Stop!” said Annie. She pulled Jack behind a tree. “Over there!”

Through the falling snow, Jack saw two people in long, dark cloaks. They were hurrying toward a tall oak—and high in the oak was the magic tree house!



“Oh, no!” said Jack.

The tree house was back! And someone else had found it!

“Hey!” Jack yelled. “Stop!” The tree house had come for him and Annie—no one else!

Jack started running. Annie followed. Jack slipped and fell in the snow, but he scrambled up and kept going. By the time he and Annie got to the tree house, the two people had climbed up the rope ladder and disappeared inside.

“Come out!” Jack yelled.

“This is our tree house!” shouted Annie.

Two kids poked their heads out of the tree house window. They both looked like they were about thirteen years old. The boy had tousled red hair and freckles. The girl had sea-blue eyes and long, curly black hair. Their cheeks were rosy from the cold. They laughed when they saw Jack and Annie.

“Excellent!” said the boy. “We came to find you, but you have found us instead.”

“Teddy!” cried Annie. “Kathleen! Hi!”

Teddy was the young sorcerer who worked with Morgan in her library in Camelot. Kathleen was the enchanted selkie girl who’d helped Jack and Annie on the summer solstice by magically turning them all into seals.

Jack was stunned. He had never imagined that their two friends from Camelot might someday visit Frog Creek! “What are you guys doing here?” he shouted.

“Climb up and we will tell you!” said Teddy.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, Annie threw her arms around Teddy and Kathleen. “I can’t believe you came to visit us!” she said.

“It pleases me to see you, Annie,” said Kathleen. “And you also, Jack.” Her large blue eyes sparkled.

“It pleases me, too,” Jack said shyly. He still thought Kathleen was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. Even when she’d been a seal, she’d been lovely.

“We went looking for you!” said Teddy. “We climbed down and walked through the woods to a road.”

“But the road was full of monsters!” said Kathleen. “A big red creature nearly ran over us! It made a honking sound!”

“Then before we knew it, a giant black monster charged at us! It had a ferocious growl!” said Teddy. “We came back here to gather our wits.”

“Those weren’t monsters!” said Annie, laughing. “They were just cars!”

“Cars?” said Teddy.

“Yeah, they have motors and people drive them,” said Jack.

“Motors?” said Teddy.

“It’s hard to explain,” said Annie. “Just remember—in our world, you have to watch out for cars every time you cross a road.”

“Indeed we will,” said Teddy.

“Why have you come here?” asked Jack.

“We found a message for you in Merlin’s chambers,” said Teddy, “and decided to deliver it ourselves.”

“So we climbed into the tree house outside Morgan’s library,” said Kathleen. “Teddy pointed to the words Frog Creek in the message and made a wish to come here. The next thing we knew, we were here in these woods.”

Teddy pulled a small gray stone from his cloak. “And this is the message we brought you,” he said.

Jack took the stone from Teddy.

The message was written in tiny handwriting. Jack read it aloud:



“Oh, wow,” said Annie. “That sounds serious.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But why didn’t Merlin send us the message himself?”

“We do not know,” said Teddy. “Neither Merlin nor Morgan has been seen for days.”

“Where did they go?” asked Annie.

“ ’Tis a mystery,” said Teddy. “Last week I journeyed to the selkie cove to bring Kathleen to Camelot. She is going to be a helper in Morgan’s library. But when we returned, we could not find Merlin or Morgan.”

“We only found this message for you,” said Kathleen.

“Aye, and I thought that when Merlin does return,” said Teddy, “he will be greatly pleased to have his staff back. Much of his power comes from its ancient and mysterious magic.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“In his message, he tells us to go to the Land-Behind-the-Clouds,” said Jack. “Where’s that?”

“ ’Tis a land far north of my cove,” said Kathleen. “I have never journeyed there.”

“Nor I,” said Teddy. “But I have read about it in Morgan’s books. ’Tis as bleak as a frozen white desert. I am eager to see it for myself.”

“So you and Kathleen are coming with us?” said Annie.

“Indeed!” said Kathleen.

“Great!” said Jack and Annie together.

“If we all work together, we can do anything, aye?” said Teddy.

“Aye!” said Annie.

I hope so, thought Jack.

Annie pointed at the words Land-Behind-the-Clouds in Merlin’s message. “Okay, ready?” she said to the others.

“Yes!” said Kathleen.

“I guess so,” said Jack.

“Onward!” said Teddy.

“I wish we could all go there!” Annie said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. Land-Behind-the-Clouds


Jack felt the sharp bite of an icy wind. He looked out the window with the others. “Oh, man,” he whispered.

The tree house was not in a tree—for there were no trees anywhere to be seen. Instead, it was sitting high on top of a steep snowdrift. Other drifts rose and fell across a vast snowy plain. Beyond the plain were hills and mountains.

“The books were right,” said Teddy, his teeth chattering. “ ’Tis bleak here indeed.”

“No, ’tis lovely,” said Kathleen. “ ’Tis the land where the northern seal people live.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Jack dug his hands into his pockets. He agreed with Teddy. The land did seem bleak—and freezing! “I wonder where Merlin’s Staff of Strength is,” he said, shivering.

“Let us begin our search!” said Kathleen. “The message tells us we must travel toward the setting sun.”

Kathleen climbed out of the tree house window. She gathered her cloak around her and sat down on top of the snowdrift. Then she pushed off and slid down the steep slope.

“Oh, wow. Wait for me!” called Annie. She climbed out the window and followed Kathleen. Whooping, she slid to the bottom of the snowdrift. “Come on, you guys! It’s fun!” she shouted.

Jack and Teddy looked at each other. “Shall we?” said Teddy. Jack nodded. He pulled his scarf tighter around his neck and followed Teddy out of the window.

Jack and Teddy sat down side by side. They pushed off and slid down the icy snowdrift. Jack couldn’t help whooping, too. It was fun.

At the bottom of the drift, Jack and Teddy scrambled to their feet. Jack brushed the snow off his clothes. He could see his breath in the frigid air.

“It’s j-just a little chilly,” said Annie, hugging herself.

Only Kathleen seemed not to mind the cold. She was smiling as she lay on the ground, gazing up at the sky. Her seal nature probably keeps her warm, Jack thought with envy.

Teddy peered across the snowy plain. “I believe not one living creature is here but us,” he said.

“Not true at all,” said Kathleen. She pointed upward. “I see snow geese and whistling swans.”

“I can almost see them, too,” said Annie.

Kathleen stood up. She shielded her eyes and gazed across the plain. The cold sun was low in the sky. It cast long blue shadows beneath the snowdrifts. She pointed into the distance. “And see? A white hare is leaping home before dark,” she said.

Jack looked where Kathleen pointed, but he couldn’t see anything moving at all.

“I see a snowy owl, too,” said Kathleen, “and—oh, no!”

“What?” said Annie.

“Wolves,” Kathleen said with a shudder. “They just disappeared behind a snowdrift. My people greatly fear the wolves.”

“You need not be afraid. I shall protect you,” said Teddy. He took Kathleen’s hand. “Come! Let us make haste toward the sun!”

Together, Teddy and Kathleen headed across the snow-covered plain. Their woolen cloaks waved behind them. Annie and Jack dug their hands in their pockets and quickly followed them toward the setting sun.

As Teddy, Kathleen, Jack, and Annie trudged across the frozen plain, the sun sank closer and closer to the horizon. Its last rays poured purple-pink light over the snow.

The wind blew against Jack’s face. He looked down and kept walking. The cold felt like needles on his skin. Each icy breath was painful. He hoped they found Merlin’s Staff of Strength soon. He couldn’t imagine anyone surviving for long in this lonely, freezing land.

Jack’s thoughts were interrupted when he heard Annie calling. He looked up. The sun had completely slipped behind the horizon. In the cold twilight, the snow had faded from purple-pink to a dark shade of blue.

“Jack! Come look!” Annie called. She, Teddy, and Kathleen were standing on the slope of a huge snowdrift.

Jack hurried to join them.

“Look!” said Annie.

“Oh, man,” Jack said softly.

On the other side of the snowdrift was a glimmering palace made from huge blocks of ice.



Beneath the rising moon, its gleaming spires pierced the blue dusk.

“I wonder who lives there … ,” said Jack.

“Let us go and find out!” said Teddy.

Teddy led the way down the slope to the ice palace. Long icicles hung like spears in front of the entrance.

“It seems no one has visited this place in quite a while,” said Kathleen.

“Indeed,” said Teddy. He broke off several icicles, and they clattered to the ground. “Onward?” he said.

The others nodded.

Kicking aside the chunks of ice, Teddy led them all into the ice palace.


3. The Ice Wizard


The air inside the palace was even colder than the air outside. Moonlight flooded through tall arches in the walls. The floor shined like a skating rink. Thick columns of sparkling ice held up a domed ceiling.

“WELCOME, JACK AND ANNIE,” boomed a voice from beyond the columns.

Jack gasped. “Is that Merlin?” he whispered.

“It does not sound like Merlin,” whispered Teddy.

“But how does he know our names?” whispered Annie.

“COME, JACK AND ANNIE. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,” bellowed the voice.

“Maybe it is Merlin!” said Annie. “Maybe he’s just using a different voice! Come on!”

“Annie, wait!” Jack called. But Annie had already disappeared into the sparkly room. “We have to follow her,” he said to Teddy and Kathleen.

The three of them hurried after Annie. Beyond the columns, steps made of carved ice led up to a platform. Sitting on a throne on the platform was a huge bearded man.

The man on the throne was definitely not Merlin. He was dressed in a worn robe trimmed with dirty fur. He had a rugged, weather-beaten face, a bushy beard, and a black eye patch. He leaned forward and glared down at Annie with his one good eye.

“Who are you?” he demanded. “I was expecting Jack and Annie of Frog Creek.”

Annie stepped toward the throne. “I am Annie and he’s Jack,” she said. “And these are our friends Teddy and Kathleen. We come in peace.”

“Annie? Jack?” the man snorted. “You are not Annie and Jack! You are far too small!”

“We’re not so small,” said Annie. “I’m nine. Jack’s ten.”

“But you are children,” the man said with scorn. “Jack and Annie are heroes!”

“Well, I don’t know if I’d call us heroes,” said Annie. “But we sometimes help Merlin and Morgan le Fay.”

“Annie, shhh!” said Jack. He didn’t trust the man on the throne and worried that Annie was saying too much.

But Annie went on. “In fact, Merlin told us to come to the Land-Behind-the-Clouds today,” she said. “He sent us a message written on a stone.”

“Ah … ,” said the man on the throne. “Perhaps you really are Jack and Annie.” He leaned forward and spoke in a low voice:

To Jack and Annie of Frog Creek:

My Staff of Strength has been stolen. On the winter solstice, journey to the Land-Behind-the-Clouds. Travel toward the setting sun and retrieve my staff—or all will be lost.

Jack didn’t understand. “How … ?”

“How do I know what was in Merlin’s message?” the man said. “I know because I wrote it myself! I hoped it would find its way to you somehow.”

Jack stepped back. So Merlin hadn’t sent them on this mission at all. The weird man on the throne had tricked them!

“Who are you?” demanded Teddy.

“I am the Ice Wizard,” said the man. “The Wizard of Winter.”

Teddy gulped.



Oh, no! thought Jack. They had heard about this wizard on their past Merlin missions. It was the Wizard of Winter who had put a spell on the Raven King and who had stolen the Sword of Light!

The wizard glanced coldly from Teddy to Kathleen. “And who are the two of you?”

“I am Teddy of Camelot,” said Teddy. “I am an apprentice to Morgan le Fay, in training to be a sorcerer myself.”

“A sorcerer?” said the wizard.

“Yes,” said Teddy. “My father was a sorcerer. My mother was a wood sprite.”

“And I am a selkie,” said Kathleen, “one of the ancient seal people.”

“So you are both from my world,” said the Ice Wizard. “You are of no use to me.” He looked back at Jack and Annie. “I am interested only in the two mortals, Jack and Annie of Frog Creek.”

“Why are you interested in us?” said Jack.

“Because of what you have done for Merlin!” bellowed the Ice Wizard. “For Merlin, you found the Water of Memory and Imagination! For Merlin, you found the Diamond of Destiny! For Merlin, you found the Sword of Light! Now I want you to find something for me.”

“What do you want us to find?” asked Annie.

The Ice Wizard grabbed the black patch covering his left eye. He yanked it off, revealing a dark, empty socket underneath.

“Yikes,” Annie said softly.

“I want you to find my eye,” the Ice Wizard said.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He was horrified.

“Are—are you quite serious?” said Teddy. “You want them to find your eye?”

The wizard covered his empty eye socket with the patch again. “Yes,” he said. “I want Jack and Annie to find my eye—and bring it back to me.”

“But—why?” said Jack. “Even if we found it, we couldn’t make it work. We’re not medical experts or anything.”

“And anyway, why can’t you get your eye yourself?” said Annie. “You’re a wizard!”

“DO NOT QUESTION MY ORDERS!” the wizard roared at her.

“Hey, don’t yell at my sister!” said Jack.

The wizard raised a bushy eyebrow. “You are brother and sister?” he said.

“Yes,” said Jack.

The wizard nodded slowly. His voice grew softer. “And you protect your sister,” he said.

“We protect each other,” said Jack.

“I see,” whispered the wizard. Then his voice turned gruff again. “Long ago, I traded my eye for something I wanted very much. But I never got what I wanted. So now I want my eye back.”

“Who did you trade with?” asked Annie.

“The Fates!” said the wizard. “I traded with the Fates! But they cheated me! And that is why I sent for you and Jack. You must go to the Fates and find my eye, and you must go alone.”

“Why alone?” asked Jack.

“Because only mortals can undo a bargain with the Fates,” said the Ice Wizard, “not wizards like me—nor seal girls, nor the sons of sorcerers, like your two friends.”

“But Jack and I succeeded in our other missions because Teddy and Kathleen or Morgan and Merlin helped us,” said Annie.

“What kind of help did they give you?” said the wizard.

“Well, mostly magic rhymes and riddles,” said Annie.

“Ah. Then I shall do the same,” said the wizard. He thought for a moment, then leaned forward on his throne. In a growly voice, he said:

Take my sleigh

And find your way

To the House of the Norns

In the curve of the bay.

Pay them whatever

They tell you to pay.

And bring back my eye

By break of day.



The wizard reached into the folds of his ragged robe and pulled out a thick string with a row of knots. “This wind-string will speed you on your journey,” he said. He tossed the string to Jack.

What’s a wind-string? Jack wondered. And who are the Norns?

Before Jack could ask any questions, the Ice Wizard pointed at him. “Now listen carefully to this warning,” he said. “Beware the white wolves of the night. They may follow you on your quest. Never let them catch up with you. If they catch you, they will eat you!”

Jack felt a chill run down his spine.

The Ice Wizard picked up a carved wooden stick from the floor beside his throne. Its smooth, polished wood glowed in the moonlight.

Teddy gasped. “ ’Tis Merlin’s Staff of Strength!” he said.

“Indeed,” said the wizard. He turned to Jack and Annie. “Go now and find my eye,” he said. “Or you will never see Merlin and Morgan le Fay again.”

“What have you done with them?” cried Annie.

The wizard stared at her coldly. “I will not tell you,” he said. “You will see them again only if you return my eye before the break of day.”

“But—” said Annie.

“No more questions!” said the wizard. “Be on your way!” Before any of them could speak, the Ice Wizard slashed the air with Merlin’s Staff of Strength and shouted a spell—“OW-NIGH!”

A flash of blue fire shot from the end of the staff. In an instant, Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen found themselves outside the palace in the freezing night.



4. Take My Sleigh

Jack sat on the frozen ground. Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen sat nearby. They were all too shocked to speak. The night was quiet. Overhead the full moon shined brightly, and a few cold stars twinkled in the clear sky.

Finally Annie broke the silence. “I wonder what he did to Merlin and Morgan,” she said.

“I wonder where you will find his eye,” said Teddy.

“I wonder how we’ll carry it around,” said Jack.

“And I wonder if the wolves are near,” said Kathleen. She stood up and looked around, pulling her cloak tightly around her.

“Well, does anyone remember the Ice Wizard’s rhyme?” said Teddy.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. She repeated the rhyme perfectly by heart:

Take my sleigh

And find your way

To the House of the Norns

In the curve of the bay.

Pay them whatever

They tell you to pay

And bring back my eye

By break of day.



“What are Norns?” asked Jack.

“I have read about the Norns in Morgan’s books,” said Teddy. “They are known as the Sisters of Fate. They spend their days weaving great tapestries. Their weaving determines the fate of all who live in the Land-Behind-the-Clouds.”

“So the Norns have his eye?” said Jack. “That’s who he meant when he said he ‘traded with the Fates’?”

“It would seem so,” said Teddy.

“He said we should take his sleigh to find them,” said Annie. “Where’s his sleigh?”

“Look,” said Kathleen, pointing. “ ’Tis there.”

“Oh, wow,” said Annie.

Not far away, a strange-looking silver sleigh glided silently from behind a snowbank. The sleigh looked like a small sailing ship with shiny runners. No one was steering it, and no horses or reindeer were pulling it. From its mast, a white sail drooped in the still air.

As the sleigh slid to a stop, an eerie howl shattered the calm of the windless night.

“Wolves!” cried Teddy. “Let us make haste!”

Kathleen grabbed his arm. “Do not run,” she said. “If we run, they will chase us.”

“Yes, of course,” said Teddy. “They must not see that we are afraid.”

Another howl shattered the air.

“Run!” cried Teddy.

They all charged across the snow to the sleigh and scrambled into it. Jack and Kathleen stood at the front, and Annie and Teddy stood at the back.

“There they are!” cried Teddy, pointing. “The white wolves of the night!”

Jack turned and saw two large white wolves dashing across the plain in the moonlight. As the wolves ran toward the sleigh, their big paws scattered snow around them.

“Go, go, go!” Jack cried, clutching the front of the sleigh.

But the sleigh didn’t move. And the wolves kept coming. “How can we make it go?” cried Jack.

“Use the wind-string!” said Teddy.

Jack pulled the knotted string the wizard had given him out of his pocket. “Use it how?” he shouted.

“Untie a knot!” said Teddy.

Jack pulled off his gloves. His fingers were trembling as he tried to untie one of the knots. This is crazy! he thought. How can untying a knot in a string help us? But soon he managed to loosen one of the knots.

A cold breeze began blowing from behind the sleigh. It ruffled the sail overhead.

“Untie another!” shouted Teddy. “Hurry!”

Jack quickly untied a second knot. The breeze grew stronger, and the sail filled out a bit more. The sleigh’s shiny runners began sliding across the snow.

“Yay!” called Annie. “It works!”

“Yes, but not nearly swiftly enough!” said Teddy.

Jack looked back. The two white wolves had almost caught up with them. They were yelping and running behind the sleigh. Their mouths were open, showing their sharp teeth.

Jack quickly untied a third knot. A cold wind blasted the sail. It opened with a snap, and the sleigh shot forward!



“Stand fast!” cried Teddy.

Jack, Annie, and Kathleen held tightly to the sides of the sleigh to keep from falling out. Teddy grabbed the rudder and steered them over the snow, away from the ice palace.

The wizard’s sleigh zoomed across the frozen ground, leaving the white wolves in its wake. Their yelping noises grew fainter and fainter, until they could be heard no more.



The wind kept pushing the silver sleigh over the ice and snow. The runners made swish-swish sounds as they slid over the moonlit plain. The square sail billowed in the wind, like the sail of a Viking ship. With the wolves far behind, the ride was really fun, but cold.

“How did you know untying knots would make the wind blow?” Jack asked Teddy.

“ ’Tis an ancient magic,” said Teddy. “I have read of wind-strings but had never seen one.”

“It’s a good thing you read so much,” said Annie.

“Oh, look!” said Kathleen. “Hares and foxes!”

“Where?” said Annie.

“There!” Kathleen pointed into the dark distance. “Playing in the snow! And listen! Whistling swans—overhead, behind that cloud.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

Jack was amazed by Kathleen’s power to see and hear so many things. As before, the moonlit landscape seemed completely empty to him.

“Where are you steering us?” Annie asked Teddy.

“I have no idea!” said Teddy, laughing.

“We’re supposed to go to a curve of a bay to find the Norns,” said Annie.

“Then turn left and follow the swans!” said Kathleen, pointing across the snowy plain. “They are flying toward the sea!”

Teddy swerved the sleigh to the left. For a while, they bounced up and down over the snow. Then the ride grew smoother.

“We are on sea ice now!” said Kathleen. “Seals are beneath! I see their breathing holes! Perhaps we should stop.”

“Indeed!” said Teddy as they whizzed along. “But how?”

“Try tying a knot!” said Annie.

“Excellent idea!” said Teddy. “Jack?”

Jack yanked off his gloves. With cold, shaky fingers, he tied a knot in the string. The wind lessened a bit. The sleigh began to slow down. He tied another. The sail started to droop.

“Hooray!” said Annie.

Jack tied a third knot and the wind completely died away. The sleigh glided to a stop.

“Well done!” said Teddy.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He tucked the string back in his pocket and looked around. “I wonder if this is where the Norns live.”

“I will ask,” said Kathleen.

Ask who? thought Jack.

Kathleen climbed out of the sleigh. She walked over the sea ice, studying it closely. Then she stopped above a small hole.

Kathleen knelt down and spoke softly in selkie language. Then she put her ear close to the hole in the ice and listened.

A moment later, she stood up. “The seal told me the curve of the bay lies just beyond those sea rocks,” she said, pointing. “That is where we will find the Norns.”

“Great,” said Annie.

Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen crunched over the frozen sea under the bright moon. They walked through a narrow passage between the sea rocks. When they stepped out from the passage, they stopped.

“There ’tis,” said Teddy.

About fifty yards away was a large, snowy white mound. Smoke was coming from a chimney on top of the mound. Lantern light flickered from a small, round window.

“I know you must bargain for the Ice Wizard’s eye alone,” said Teddy. “But I would at least like to take a peek at the Norns.”

He moved quietly to the window and peered into the house. The others joined him. They saw a large fire burning on a hearth. In its rosy glow, three strange creatures were weaving at a big loom. Jack caught his breath. Their appearance was shocking.



The three Sisters of Fate were as skinny as skeletons. They all had straggly hair, long noses, and huge, bulging eyes. Their crooked, bony fingers fluttered over a large tapestry. Around the room other tapestries were stacked to the ceiling.

“They look like witches in a fairy tale,” whispered Annie.

“Aye, but they are not witches,” said Teddy. “Every cloth they weave is the history of a life.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Well, good luck,” said Teddy. “Kathleen and I will wait out here while you go inside and ask for the wizard’s eye.”

Suddenly a terrible howl pierced the silence.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“The wolves!” said Kathleen.

Teddy hurried to the door and threw it open. “Everyone inside!” he said.

And all four of them scrambled into the House of the Norns.


5. The Norns


Teddy slammed the door against the wolves. Jack caught his breath.

“Welcome!” the three Norns said in unison. They all looked exactly alike, except they wore gowns of different colors—blue, brown, and gray.

“How are you, Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen?” said the blue Norn.

“We’re good now,” said Annie.

Jack was amazed that the Norns knew all their names. Despite their strange appearance, their friendly smiles and twinkling eyes put him at ease. In their cozy house, he began to feel warm for the first time since they had left home.

“Was your journey pleasant?” asked the brown Norn.

“Yes. We came in the Ice Wizard’s sleigh,” said Annie.

“With the help of a wind-string,” said Teddy. Jack held up the string to show them.

The gray Norn cackled. “Yes, we know! I like a string with knots,” she said.

“A string without knots would be a boring string indeed!” said the blue Norn.

“A life without knots would be a boring life indeed!” chimed in the brown Norn.

As they spoke, the Norns kept weaving. Their bulging eyes never blinked. Jack sensed that they never closed their eyes—or stopped their work.

“Sorry to bother you,” said Annie. “But Jack and I need the eye of the Ice Wizard of Winter so we can save our friends Merlin and Morgan.”

“We know,” said the blue Norn. “We are weaving the story of the Ice Wizard now. Come look.”

Jack moved with the others to the loom. Dozens of tiny pictures were woven into the tapestry. The threads were all wintry colors—blues, grays, and browns.

“The pictures tell the story of the wizard’s life,” explained the brown Norn.

One picture showed two children playing together. Another showed a boy running after a swan. Another showed two white wolves—and another showed an eye in a circle.

“What’s the story of the eye?” Jack asked.

“Long ago, the Ice Wizard came to us seeking all the wisdom of the world,” said the gray Norn. “We said we would give him wisdom if he gave us one of his eyes. He agreed to the bargain.”

“The wizard doesn’t seem very wise,” said Annie.

“Indeed he is not,” said the brown Norn. “We planted the seeds of wisdom in his heart, but they never grew.”

“Why did you want his eye?” asked Jack.

“We wished to give it to the Frost Giant,” said the blue Norn.

“The Frost Giant?” said Teddy. “Who is the Frost Giant?”



“He is neither magician nor mortal,” said the blue Norn. “He is a blind force of nature that spares nothing in his path.”

“We hoped the Frost Giant would use the wizard’s eye to see the beauty of the world, so he might choose to care for it rather than destroy it,” said the brown Norn. “But alas, the Frost Giant does not use our gift at all! Instead, he keeps it hidden away—right where we left it!”

“Where’s that?” asked Annie.

“The Frost Giant sleeps inside the Hollow Hill,” said the gray Norn.

“In the Hollow Hill is a hole,” said the blue Norn.

“In the hole is a hailstone,” said the brown Norn.

“And in the heart of the hailstone hides the wizard’s eye,” said the gray Norn.

Jack closed his eyes and repeated:

In the Hollow Hill is a hole.

In the hole is a hailstone.

In the heart of the hailstone

Hides the wizard’s eye.



“Yes!” said the gray Norn. “That is where you must go. But beware: You must never look directly at the Frost Giant. Anyone who looks directly at the Frost Giant will freeze to death at once.”

Jack shivered and nodded.

“Well, we’d better get going,” said Annie. “Thanks for your help. The Ice Wizard’s rhyme tells us to pay you whatever you ask us to pay.”

The Norns looked at each other. “I like that weaving around her neck,” the gray Norn said to her sisters. “ ’Tis red like the fiery dawn.” The other two Norns nodded eagerly.

“My scarf?” said Annie. “Sure. Here.” She took off her red woolen scarf and placed it on the floor near the Norns’ loom.

“Lovely!” said the blue Norn. “Perhaps we will stop weaving fates and start weaving scarves!”

The other Norns cackled. “Well, go now,” said the gray Norn. “Travel toward the North Star. When you reach the snowy hills, look for the one whose peak is missing.”

Jack, Annie, and Teddy started toward the door, but Kathleen stayed behind. “Forgive me, but I have one more question,” she said. She pointed to the picture of the swan and the boy on the tapestry. “What is this story?”

“ ’Tis a sad tale,” said the gray Norn. “The Ice Wizard had a younger sister who loved him more than anything in the world. One day they fought over something foolish. He lost his temper and told her to leave him alone forever. She ran down to the sea in tears. There she found a flock of swan maidens. They gave her a white feathered dress. She put on the dress and became a swan maiden herself. She flew away with the others and never returned.”

“After that the Ice Wizard was never the same,” said the blue Norn. “When his sister left, he grew cold and mean-spirited. ’Twas as if his sister took his heart with her when she flew away.”

“That is sad,” said Annie. “How will the Ice Wizard’s story end?”

“You—not we—will determine the threads we weave next,” said the brown Norn.

“We will?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said the gray Norn. “Our powers are fading. Our plans no longer work the way we expect them to. The Ice Wizard has no wisdom! The Frost Giant has no sight! You must go now and finish the story.”

The three sisters smiled at their visitors. Their skinny fingers fluttered over their weaving like butterflies over flowers.

Jack couldn’t help smiling back at them. But then he thought about Merlin and Morgan. He thought about all the dangers waiting outside. “One last question,” he said. “What’s the story of the two white wolves?”

“Oh, the wolves!” said the blue Norn. “Do not fear the wolves! A life without wolves would be a boring life indeed!” Her two sisters smiled in agreement. For the moment, their smiles made Jack feel unafraid of the white wolves—and the Ice Wizard and the Frost Giant, too.

“Good-bye! Good-bye! Good-bye!” said the three sisters.

Jack and the others waved good-bye. Then they slipped out of the House of the Norns and into the icy night.


6. In the Hollow Hill


Standing in the cold, Jack felt afraid again. There were big paw prints in the moonlit snow all around the house.

“The wolves were here,” said Kathleen.

“Perhaps we should go back inside,” said Teddy.

“No,” said Kathleen. “We must walk with Jack and Annie back to the sleigh and send them on their journey to the Hollow Hill.”

“Yes, of course,” said Teddy, nodding.

As they all headed cautiously toward the rocks, Jack glanced back at the House of the Norns. He wished they could return to its cozy warmth.

Kathleen put her hand on his shoulder. “Come,” she said. “You must hurry.”

Jack trudged with the others through the passage in the rocks. When they got to the other side, there was no sign of the two white wolves. The silver sleigh was waiting in the moonlight. Jack and Annie climbed inside it.

“Can’t you come with us?” Jack asked Teddy and Kathleen. “Remember you said if we all work together, we can do anything?”

“Aye,” said Teddy. “But what the Ice Wizard said is true. Only mortals can undo a bargain with the Fates.”

“Do not fear,” said Kathleen. “We will be with you in spirit. And we will meet you back at the wizard’s palace at dawn.”

“How will you get there?” asked Annie.

“I have a few rhymes I can try,” said Teddy, smiling.

“And I have a bit of selkie magic,” said Kathleen.

“And we have our wind-string!” said Annie.

“Hasten, then, to the Hollow Hill,” said Kathleen.

“And remember what the Norns told you,” said Teddy. “Never look at the Frost Giant.”

“I know,” said Jack. He pulled out the wind-string. He took off his gloves and untied a knot. A breeze began to blow.

Jack untied a second knot. The breeze grew stronger, the sail unfurled, and the runners slid forward.

Jack untied a third knot. The wind blew hard. The white sail snapped, and the sleigh took off through the night.

“Stand fast!” Teddy called after them.

Jack and Annie waved good-bye to Teddy and Kathleen as the sleigh slid swiftly over the sea ice. Soon the sleigh bumped onto the snow-covered plain and veered off sharply to the right.

“No, toward the North Star!” Jack called to Annie.

Annie turned the rudder, steering the sleigh back on course. They sailed toward the bright star in the distance.

As the silver runners swished across the windswept snow, Jack braced himself against the cold. He kept a lookout for the white wolves, but he didn’t see any sign of them as the sleigh sped across the moonlit plain.

Soon he could see a row of snow-covered hills in the distance. “Look!” he said. “There it is!” He pointed to one of the hills—the only one without a peak.

“Tie her down!” Annie shouted.

Jack tied a knot in the string, and the sleigh began to slow down. He tied a second, then a third. The wind died down completely, and the sleigh coasted to a stop at the foot of the Hollow Hill. Jack and Annie climbed out.

Jack looked up at the steep white slope. “How do we get inside?” he said.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “How do you think the Frost Giant gets inside?”

“Oh … the Frost Giant,” said Jack. He really wished Teddy and Kathleen were with them. He felt as if part of their team was missing.

Annie seemed to read his thoughts. “We can do it,” she said. “We have to—for Morgan and Merlin.”

Jack nodded. “You’re right,” he said. They studied the hill in the moonlight.

“Up there—is that an opening?” said Annie.

“Maybe,” said Jack. “Let’s climb up and check it out.” When they climbed a little way up the hill, Jack could clearly see a break in the snow-covered slope.

“Let’s see if it leads inside!” said Annie.

“Wait, what about the Frost Giant?” said Jack.

“I have a feeling he’s not here right now,” said Annie. “We’d better go in and find the wizard’s eye before he comes back.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “But be careful!”

They scurried farther up the slope. When they came to the opening, they stepped through the huge crack into the hill.

Jack and Annie found themselves on a ledge above a deep, rounded hollow. Moonlight flooded down through the open hilltop. At the bottom of the hollow was a flat spot where it looked as if the snow had been blown in circles.



“That must be where the giant sleeps!” said Annie.

“Yeah, and it’s probably where he hides the eye,” said Jack. “We just have to find a hole. Remember?” He repeated what the Norns had said:

In the Hollow Hill is a hole.

In the hole is a hailstone.

In the heart of the hailstone

Hides the wizard’s eye.



“Right,” said Annie.

Jack looked down at the snowy swirl. He looked back at Annie. “Onward?”

“Onward,” she whispered.

Jack and Annie scrambled down into the hollow. Stepping carefully through the silver moonlight, they studied the ground, looking for the hole.

Annie stumbled and fell. “Whoa!” she said. “I think I just found the hole! I stepped in it!”

“Really?” said Jack. He knelt down beside her.

Annie reached down into a small hole in the floor of the hollow. “There’s something in here!” she said. She pulled out a chunk of ice the size of an egg. “The hailstone!”

In the dim light, it was impossible to see if anything was inside the ice chunk. “We don’t know if this is the right hailstone,” said Jack. “We’ll have to wait till daylight to see if the eye’s in there.”

“It has to be the right one,” said Annie. “How many hailstones are hidden in a hole in a hollow hill?”

“Good point,” said Jack.

Annie turned the hailstone over in her hand. “Maybe the eye is looking at us now,” she said.

“That’s scientifically impossible,” said Jack. “An eye can’t see unless it’s connected to a brain.”

“Yeah, and a string can’t make the wind blow, either,” said Annie. “Forget science in this place. Wait—” She caught her breath. “Did you feel that?”

“Feel what?” said Jack.

“The ground’s shaking,” said Annie.

Jack did feel the ground trembling. He heard a strange sound, too—a loud huffing sound coming from outside the hill—HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFF.… It sounded like breathing!

“The giant’s back!” said Annie.

“Oh, no!” cried Jack.

The ground kept rumbling. The breathing sounds got louder.

“Hide the hailstone!” said Jack.

Annie shoved the ice chunk into her pocket.

HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFF.… It sounded like the giant was entering the hollow!

“He’s coming!” said Annie.

“Hide!” whispered Jack.

Jack pulled Annie into the shadows. He remembered the gray Norn’s warning: Anyone who looks directly at the Frost Giant will freeze to death at once.

“Whatever you do, don’t look at him!” he whispered to Annie.

Crouching in the dark, they buried their faces in their hands and waited.…



7. The Frost Giant

HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFFF.… With each breath from the Frost Giant, a blast of cold wind swept through the hollow.

Jack trembled. He felt chilled to the bone. HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFFF.…

The giant’s breathing grew louder and stronger. Jack squeezed his eyes shut as icy, wet wind rushed against his body.

HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFFF.…

Jack crouched lower and held on tightly to Annie.

HUFFFF, HUFFFF, HUFFFFF.…

The giant’s breath howled like a hundred ghosts through the hollow. Jack thought of the blue Norn’s words: He is a blind force of nature that spares nothing in his path.…

But then the giant’s breathing seemed to grow a bit softer. What’s happening? Jack wondered.

The breathing grew softer and softer. “Maybe he’s going to sleep,” Annie whispered.

The breathing became calm and steady. The wind died to a light breeze.

“I think the Frost Giant is sleeping,” Annie whispered. “We should try to sneak out of here.”

“Okay, but keep your eyes down. Just look at the ground!” whispered Jack.

“Right,” whispered Annie.

Their heads bowed, Jack and Annie crept cautiously across the floor of the hollow and began climbing up toward the crack. Jack’s teeth chattered, but he couldn’t tell if it was from cold or fear.

Suddenly a deafening roar shook the night! The Frost Giant screamed with windy rage! He was awake!

Jack was blown to the ground. He tried to crawl across the snow, but he didn’t know which way to go, and he was afraid to look up.

“Jack! This way!” Annie’s voice called above the roar of the giant’s breath. She helped him up and they struggled together against the wind. Finally they came to the crack in the wall.

Jack and Annie scrambled through the crack. Outside, the wild wind knocked them over, and they tumbled down the side of the hill.

The wind swirled the snow across the plain. “Annie! Annie!” Jack called. Where was she? Where was the sleigh? He couldn’t see anything. He couldn’t stay on his feet.

The wind roared even louder. An avalanche of snow came crashing down the hillside. When it hit the ground, the snow exploded into great clouds of white powder.

“Jack! Jack!”



Jack heard Annie’s voice in the screaming wind. He tried to stand up. But snow kept falling on top of him, until he was completely covered.

As Jack lay buried under the snow, all his strength left his body. He knew he should dig his way out, but he was too cold and too tired. He was too tired to look for Annie. He was too tired to fight the Frost Giant. Instead, he closed his eyes and drifted into an icy sleep.





Jack dreamed that cold fur was brushing against his face. He dreamed that a wolf was digging around him, nudging him, pushing him, sniffing him … .

Jack opened his eyes. He felt dazed. At first he couldn’t see. But he could feel that he wasn’t buried in snow anymore. He wiped off his glasses. He saw a low moon and some stars in a clear sky.

The Frost Giant must have left, Jack thought. But then he heard a panting noise. He sat up and looked around. One of the white wolves was crouching right behind him!

Jack scrambled to his feet. “Go away!” he shouted.

The wolf stepped back and growled.

“Go! Go! Go!” shouted Jack. He picked up handfuls of snow and threw them at the wolf.

The wolf backed away a few more feet. Jack looked around wildly. Annie was lying very still on top of the snow. The other white wolf was sniffing and pawing at her.

Jack’s anger made him fearless. “Leave her alone!” he shouted. “Go away!” He scooped up more snow and threw it.

The wolf stepped back.

“GO! GO!” shouted Jack. “Get away! Leave us alone!” He glared angrily at the two white wolves.

The wolves stared back at Jack. Their yellow eyes gleamed.

“I’m not kidding—GO!” shouted Jack.



Jack stared fiercely at the wolves. Finally the wolves looked away. They glanced at each other and then slowly backed off. They looked at Jack and Annie one last time. Then they turned and trotted away over the snow.

Jack rushed to Annie. He knelt beside her and lifted her head. “Wake up! Wake up!” he said.

Annie opened her eyes.

“You okay?” Jack asked.

“Yes … I dreamed about white wolves,” Annie murmured.

“Me too!” said Jack. “And then when I woke up, they were here! They were about to eat us!”

“Really?” Annie sat up and looked around.

“Yeah, but I scared them off,” said Jack.

“What about the Frost Giant?” Annie said.

“He’s gone, too,” said Jack. “Come on. Let’s get out of here!” Jack helped Annie up from the snow. “Do you still have the wizard’s eye?”

Annie felt in her pocket. “Got it,” she said.

“Good.” Jack looked around. Beyond the heaps of fallen snow, the silver sleigh was waiting for them. Overhead, the sky had turned to a light shade of gray.

“It’s almost dawn,” said Jack. “Remember what the wizard said? We have to bring back his eye by the break of day—or we’ll never see Merlin or Morgan again!”

Jack held Annie’s hand and they trudged together through the snow. When they got to the sleigh, they climbed inside. Annie took her place at the rudder. Jack pulled out the wind-string and untied a knot.

The breeze rocked the sleigh. Jack untied a second knot, and the sail began to fill. He untied a third, and the silver sleigh moved forward, gliding over the white ground.

Swish—swish—swish. The sleigh moved through the thick snow and away from the Hollow Hill. As they sailed over the white plain, the sky was turning from gray to pale pink.

“We have to go faster!” said Annie.

Jack untied a fourth knot. The wind whistled in his ears. The sleigh picked up speed. Annie steered it past the rocks and over the sea ice. She steered it over the plain, south to the palace of the Ice Wizard.

When the sleigh drew close to the palace, Jack tied a knot, and they began to slow down. He tied three more, and the sleigh came to a stop.

Jack and Annie looked around in the faint, cold light. “I wonder where Teddy and Kathleen are,” said Annie. “They said they’d meet us here at dawn.”

Jack studied the vast white plain, but he saw no sign of their friends. He wished he had Kathleen’s vision. “I hope they’re okay,” he said. “I hope they didn’t run into the white wolves.”

“I have a feeling the wolves wouldn’t hurt them,” said Annie. “The wolf in my dream seemed nice.”

“Dream wolves are different from real wolves,” said Jack.

“I don’t think we can wait for them,” said Annie. “The eye has to be back by the time the sun comes up.”

“The eye!” said Jack. “We never looked to see if it was inside the hailstone.”

Annie reached in her pocket and pulled out the hailstone. She held it up.



Jack gasped. Staring out at him from inside the ice was an eyeball. It was about the size of a large marble. The eyeball was white with a sparkling blue center.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” said Annie.

“I don’t know about that.” Jack felt a little queasy. Seeing an eye outside of a human head was too weird for him. “Put it away for now,” he said.

Annie put the hailstone back in her pocket. Jack looked around again. The sky had brightened from pale pink to red. A thin sliver of the sun was peeking over the horizon.

“The sun!” cried Jack. “Hurry!” He and Annie jumped out of the sleigh and charged toward the palace.

When they got to the entrance, Annie stopped. “Look!” she said, pointing to big paw prints in the snow. “Wolf tracks!”

“Oh, no,” said Jack. “Do you think the white wolves are inside? That’s weird.”

“It doesn’t matter! We have to go in! Hurry!” said Annie. They rushed into the palace—just as the fiery ball of the sun rose over the horizon.


8. Return of the Eye


Jack and Annie walked through the front hall of the palace, past the ice columns, and into the wizard’s throne room. The walls and floor glittered with the brilliant, cold light of dawn.

“Uh-oh,” said Jack.

The wizard was waiting for them—and the two white wolves were sleeping on either side of his throne. Jack was confused. Why are they here? he wondered. Do they belong to the wizard?

The wolves lifted their heads and sniffed the air. Their ears pricked up. When they caught sight of Jack and Annie, they sprang to their feet. They stared at them with piercing yellow eyes.

The Ice Wizard was staring intently at Jack and Annie, too. “Well?” he said. “Did you bring back my eye?”

“Yes,” said Jack.

Annie took the hailstone out of her pocket and held it up to the wizard. Jack watched the wolves nervously as the hailstone passed from Annie’s small hand into the wizard’s large, rough hand.

The wizard stared down at the chunk of ice. Then he looked at Jack and Annie. “Indeed, you are heroes,” he said breathlessly.

“Not really,” Jack murmured.

The wizard looked again at his eye inside the hailstone. Then, with a quick movement, he slammed the ice chunk against the arm of his throne.

Jack and Annie gasped and stepped back. The wizard slammed the hailstone against his throne again. This time, the ice cracked.

The wizard gently pried his eye out of the heart of the hailstone. He lifted the frozen eyeball into the air and studied it in the light. Then, with an eager cry, he ripped off his eye patch.

Jack and Annie watched in amazement as the wizard fitted the eye into its dark, empty socket. Jack held his breath. He was horrified, yet fascinated. He couldn’t imagine someone just shoving an eye back into his head.

The wizard slowly lowered his hand. He seemed to be holding his breath. He had two eyes. But the new one didn’t move. It looked as if it was still frozen.

Jack grew worried. If the eye didn’t work, the wizard might not help them. “We—we brought you your eye,” he said. “So can you tell us where Merlin and Morgan are now?”

The wizard jerked his head to look at Jack. He covered one eye with his hand. Then he covered the other. In a frenzy, he went back and forth, covering and uncovering each eye.

Finally the wizard dropped his hand and roared, “NO!” The wizard’s howl shook the ice columns. “You have tricked me!”



“No we haven’t,” said Annie.

“This eye is useless!” cried the wizard. “It has no life! No sight!”

“But that’s the eye you gave to the Norns,” said Annie. “You promised if we brought it back, you’d give us Merlin and Morgan.”

The two white wolves threw back their heads and howled.

“NO!” cried the wizard. “You tricked me! You tricked me!”

“Let’s get out of here,” whispered Jack. He pulled Annie toward the ice columns.



“STOP!” shouted the wizard. “YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME!” He grabbed Merlin’s Staff of Strength. The wolves growled and yelped. The wizard pointed the staff at Jack and Annie. He started to say a spell—“RO-EEE—”

“WAIT!” someone yelled. Teddy burst into the throne room. “Wait! Wait!”

The wizard held his staff in the air. He stared wildly at Teddy. His face was twisted with rage.

“We have something for you!” Teddy shouted at the wizard. “Kathleen!” he called.

Kathleen stepped out from behind the ice columns. With her was a young woman with long braids. The woman wore a flowing dress. Around her shoulders was a white feathered cloak. Her eyes rested on the wizard, and a radiant smile spread over her face. She began walking slowly toward the throne.

The wizard lowered Merlin’s Staff of Strength. He stared back at the young woman. All the color drained from his face. For a long moment, he was as still as a statue. Then an ice-blue tear leaked out of his frozen eye and ran down his white cheek.

Jack and Annie stood with Kathleen and Teddy. They all watched the young woman and the Ice Wizard gaze silently at each other.



“Is she his sister, the swan maiden?” whispered Annie.

“Yes,” whispered Kathleen.

The swan maiden spoke to the Ice Wizard in a strange language—“Val-ee-ven-o-wan.”

The wizard did not answer. Tears flowed gently now from both his eyes.

“Val-ee-ven-o-wan,” the swan maiden said again.

“What’s she saying?” Jack asked.

“She is saying, I have come back to forgive you,” said Kathleen.

The wizard stood up. He walked down the steps from his throne. He gently touched the swan maiden’s face, as if to make sure she was real. Then he answered her softly in the strange language. “Fel-o-wan.”

“How did you find her?” Jack asked Teddy.

“A seal took us under the ice to the Isle of the Swans,” said Teddy.

“When we found her, I told her how much the wizard has missed her,” said Kathleen. “I also told her about the two of you and how you always help each other. I told her she should return to her brother and be his friend again.”

The wizard and his sister kept speaking softly to each other in their strange language. Warm sunlight shimmered through the palace windows.

Annie stepped forward. “Um—excuse me,” she said.

The wizard looked at her. “My sister has returned home,” he said with wonder. “I can see with both eyes now. I can see perfectly.”

“I’m glad,” said Annie. “But now you must give Merlin and Morgan back to us.”

The wizard looked at his sister. She nodded. The wizard held out Merlin’s Staff of Strength. “Use this to bring them back,” he said. “Hold it tightly and call out for them.” He gave the staff to Annie.

Annie could barely lift it by herself. “Hold it with me, Jack,” she said.

Jack stepped forward and grabbed the magic staff. The smooth, golden wood felt warm and vibrant in his hands.

As they gripped the staff together, Annie threw back her head and called out: “Merlin and Morgan, come back!”

A long burst of blue light shot out of the end of the staff—and flashed toward the two white wolves.

Suddenly wolf eyes changed into human eyes! Wolf noses changed into human noses! Wolf mouths changed into human mouths! Wolf ears into human ears! Wolf paws into human hands and feet! Wolf fur into long red cloaks!

The two white wolves were gone, and a man and a woman stood in their places.



9. Wisdom of the Heart

“Merlin! Morgan!” shouted Annie.

Teddy and Kathleen cried out in amazement.

Annie rushed to Morgan and hugged her.

Jack was filled with giddy relief. “Hi!” he said. “Hi!”

“Welcome back, sir!” Teddy said to Merlin.

“Thank you,” said Merlin. He looked at Jack and Annie. “And thank you for turning us back into ourselves.”

“We didn’t know you and Morgan were the wolves!” Annie said.

“We were following you so we could help you,” said Morgan.

“The wizard told us that if you caught up with us, you would eat us!” said Jack.

“Really?” said Morgan.

They all looked at the Ice Wizard. Standing with his sister, he stared guiltily at Morgan and Merlin.

“I feared that if they got close to you, they might discover who you were,” he said. “But I will do no more harm, I promise—for I can see clearly now.” The wizard looked back at his sister, and his blue eyes shined with joy.

“You can see because you have your heart back,” said Morgan. “It was not only your eye that was missing—it was also your heart. We see with our hearts as well as our eyes.”

“And now perhaps you can find the wisdom you were seeking from the Norns,” said Merlin, “for wisdom is knowledge learned with the heart as well as the head.”

The Ice Wizard nodded. “Please find it in your hearts to forgive me,” he said. “Use my sleigh to take you safely home.”

“Yes, indeed, we must leave now,” said Morgan. “We have been gone from Camelot too long.”

“The next time you come to Camelot, my friend, you must come as a guest,” said Merlin, “not as a thief in the night.”

“And you must bring your sister also,” Morgan said to the wizard.

“Indeed I will,” the wizard said.

Merlin looked at Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen. “Is everyone ready to leave now?” he asked.

“Yes, sir,” they all answered together.

Merlin looked at the Staff of Strength in Jack’s hands.

“Oh! Sorry, I almost forgot,” said Jack. He handed the heavy staff to Merlin.

As soon as Merlin held the Staff of Strength, he seemed more powerful. “Let us be off!” he said briskly.

Merlin and Morgan led the way out of the throne room, their red cloaks billowing behind them. Teddy and Kathleen followed, and Jack and Annie hurried after them.

Just before they left the room, Jack and Annie glanced back at the Ice Wizard and his swan sister. They were deep in conversation again.

“They haven’t seen each other for years,” said Annie. “They must have a lot to talk about.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He couldn’t imagine not seeing Annie for years. “Come on, let’s go.” He took her hand and pulled her out of the throne room, through the front hall, and into the cold dawn.

Jack and Annie followed their four Camelot friends to the wizard’s sleigh. Everyone climbed in.

Annie sat at the rudder. Jack stood at the front. He pulled out the wind-string and untied a knot. The sleigh rocked forward. He untied another, and the sleigh started moving very slowly.

The sleigh was heavier than before, so Jack quickly untied two more knots. The sleigh bolted across the snow.

“Stand fast!” said Teddy.

As the sleigh swished through the dawn, Annie turned to Morgan and Merlin. “I have a question,” she said. “Can you tell us what the giant looks like—the Frost Giant?”

Merlin smiled. “There is no Frost Giant,” he said.

“What?” said Kathleen and Teddy.

“Sure there is,” said Annie. “We heard his breathing!”

“He nearly froze us to death!” said Jack.

“At night, the wind often swirls through the Hollow Hill like a cyclone,” said Merlin. “You experienced one of those storms.”

“But what about the Norns’ story of giving the wizard’s eye to the Frost Giant as a gift?” said Jack.

“Many ancient peoples believe that the forces of nature are actual giants or monsters,” said Morgan. “The Norns are the last of their kind. They hold to the idea that the Frost Giant is a living creature who haunts the Hollow Hill. In truth, the Frost Giant never accepted their gift because there is no Frost Giant.”

Jack shook his head. “We believed what the Norns believed. They told us we’d freeze to death if we looked directly at the Frost Giant.”

“And we believed what the wizard told us, too,” said Annie, “that the wolves would eat us if they caught up to us!”

“People often try to convince us that the world is scarier than it truly is,” said Morgan.

Right now the world didn’t seem at all scary to Jack. Everything was calm and bright. Soft, rose-colored light was breaking through the morning clouds.

“Today is the first day after the winter solstice,” said Morgan. “Today the light starts to return. The days will grow longer.”

Jack turned to look at the sun. He caught sight of the tree house sitting on top of a snowdrift, not far away.

Jack tied a knot in the wind-string. He tied three more, and the sleigh came to a stop at the foot of the snowdrift.



Merlin looked at them. “On the winter solstice, you showed great courage,” he said. “You endured storms and terror and extraordinary cold. You reunited the Ice Wizard and the swan maiden. And perhaps most important, you retrieved my Staff of Strength. I thank you.”

“Sure,” Jack and Annie said modestly.

“You have done much for the kingdom of Camelot on your last four missions,” said Merlin. “On your next adventure, you will have a mission back in your world—in real time, not in the time of myth and magicians.”

“We will call for you again soon,” said Morgan.

“Great!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie climbed out of the sleigh. They looked back at Teddy and Kathleen. “I hope you will help us with our next journey, too,” said Annie.

Teddy smiled. “If we all work together, we can do anything, aye?” he said.

“Aye!” said Jack and Annie together. Then they turned and trudged up the snowdrift. At the top, they climbed into the window of the tree house. Once they were inside, they looked back.

The sleigh was gone.

“Bye,” Annie said softly.

Jack picked up the small gray stone from the floor. He pointed at the words Frog Creek in the wizard’s message. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

It blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.




Jack opened his eyes. They were back in the Frog Creek woods. No time at all had passed while they’d been gone. It was almost twilight. Snowflakes fell like tiny feathers outside the tree house window.

Annie shivered. “I’m cold,” she said.

“Here—take my scarf,” said Jack. He pulled off his scarf.

“No, you need it,” said Annie.

“No, take it. I’ll be okay.” Jack put his scarf around Annie’s neck. “What will you tell Mom when she asks about your scarf?” he asked.

“I’ll just tell her the Sisters of Fate took it as payment for telling us how to find the eye of the Ice Wizard in a hole in the Hollow Hill,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack, laughing.

“We’d better get home before dark,” said Annie. She started down the rope ladder. Jack followed her.

As they stepped onto the ground, Jack remembered the wind-string. “We forgot to give this back,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the string. “I guess Merlin’s magic took the sleigh back to Camelot.”

Jack and Annie looked at the string for a moment. “Untie a knot,” Annie whispered.

Jack took off his gloves and untied a knot. He held his breath and waited. Nothing happened. He gave Annie a little smile. “I guess in our world, it’s just a piece of string,” he said.

Jack put the string back in his pocket. He and Annie started walking over the snowy ground between the trees. As they walked, Jack looked for Teddy’s and Kathleen’s footprints. But they were completely gone.

Jack and Annie moved out of the woods and down their street. They saw Christmas tree lights sparkling in people’s houses and candles shining in windows.

Their boots squeaked as they crossed their snow-covered yard. When they got to the stairs of the porch, Jack stopped. He stared in astonishment.

Annie’s red woolen scarf was draped over the railing of the porch.

“I don’t believe it!” said Jack.

“I do!” said Annie.

They hurried up the stairs and Annie grabbed her scarf. “Look!” she said.

She held up the scarf to show Jack. There was a tiny picture woven into it: a picture of him and Annie and two white wolves.

Jack was speechless.



“Cool, huh?” said Annie. She gave Jack back his scarf. Then she tied her scarf around her neck. She tucked the part with the picture under her jacket collar.

The front door opened. A delicious smell wafted out from the house.

“Hi!” said their mom. “The cookies are ready. Come inside and get warm!”



A Note from the Author

Some time ago I wrote a book called Favorite Norse Myths. In that book, I retold the myths of the Viking people, who lived long ago in the icy, rugged lands of Scandinavia. While I was working on Winter of the Ice Wizard, several elements from the Norse myths inspired the plot of my story. For instance, the Norse myths tell about a god named Odin who traded his eye for all the wisdom of the world, and they tell about Frost Giants, who represent the most brutal forces of nature. There are also three sister goddesses known as the Norns who decide the future. (In Greek mythology, three sisters called the Fates determine the future.)

While doing further research on the old legends of Nordic lands, I came across the swan maidens, women who could turn into swans, as well as wind-ropes (or wind-strings). I found out that wizards sold ropes with knots of wind to seafarers to help their ships sail across the ocean. Wind-strings are also mentioned in Hans Christian Andersen’s story “The Snow Queen.” The reindeer in “The Snow Queen” says that he can “twist all the winds of the world together in a knot. If a seaman loosens one knot, then he has a good wind.”

Winter of the Ice Wizard closes this quartet of Merlin Missions. On these four missions, Jack and Annie find magical treasures for Merlin: water from the Cauldron of Memory and Imagination, the Diamond of Destiny, the Sword of Light, and the Staff of Strength. These four things were inspired by the Four Hallows of Camelot, which, according to Irish legend, were the four most sacred gifts of the ancient Celtic people.

Dawn was breaking in the Frog Creek woods. Jack saw a light shining up ahead. He ran toward it. He ran so fast, he couldn’t hear his feet hitting the ground. He couldn’t feel the frosty winter air.

As Jack got closer to the light, he could see the magic tree house at the top of the tallest oak. A girl and boy were looking out the window. The girl had dark, wavy hair and sea-blue eyes. The boy had tousled red hair and a big grin on his face. As the two kids waved at him, Jack felt incredibly happy.

“Jack, wake up!”

Jack opened his eyes. His sister, Annie, was standing beside his bed. She was wearing her winter jacket. It was barely light outside.

“I just had a dream about the tree house,” she said.

“Really?” Jack said sleepily.

“I dreamed we were running through the woods at dawn,” said Annie, “and when we got to the tree house, Teddy and Kathleen were there waiting for us.”

Jack sat up. “I just had the same dream!” he said.

“Meet you downstairs,” said Annie.

Annie left Jack’s room. Jack jumped out of bed, put on his glasses, and threw on his clothes. He grabbed his winter jacket and his backpack. Then he slipped quietly down the stairs and out the front door.

Annie was waiting on the porch. The February air was chilly. Frost sparkled in the grass as the sun rose over the Frog Creek woods.

“Ready?” asked Annie.

Jack nodded and zipped his jacket. Without another word, he and Annie hurried up their street and headed into the woods. They ran through the long shadows of early morning, between the bare winter trees. Then they stopped.

The tree house was back, just as Jack had seen it in his dream! It was high in the tallest oak tree, shining in the cold morning light.

“Wow,” breathed Jack. “Dreams can come true.”

“Yep,” said Annie. “Teddy! Kathleen!”

No one answered.

“I guess only part of this dream came true,” Annie said sadly. She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed. Annie climbed into the tree house. “Oh, wow!” she said.

“What is it?” said Jack.

“They’re here!” said Annie in a loud whisper. Jack climbed in behind her. Their friends Teddy and Kathleen, apprentices to Morgan le Fay, were sitting under the tree house window. Wrapped in heavy woolen cloaks, they were both fast asleep.

“Hey, sleepyheads!” said Annie. “Wake up!”

Kathleen blinked and yawned. Teddy rubbed his eyes. When he saw Jack and Annie, he gave them a wide grin and leapt to his feet. “Hello!” he said.

“Hello!” cried Annie. She threw her arms around Teddy. “We both dreamed you were here.”

“Ah, then our magic worked!” said Teddy. “Kathleen suggested we send dreams to let you know we were here, and it seems our magic sent us to dreamland as well.”

“But now we are all awake,” said Kathleen. “And I am very glad to see you.” She stood up, drawing her cloak around her. Her blue eyes sparkled like seawater in the dawn light.

“I’m glad to see you, too,” Jack said shyly.

“Are you taking us on another Merlin Mission?” said Annie.

“Not exactly,” said Teddy. “Merlin has a most important mission for you. But this time, we will not be going along.”

“Oh, no!” said Annie. “What if we need your magic to help us?”

Teddy and Kathleen looked at each other and smiled. Then Kathleen turned back to Jack and Annie. “Morgan thinks you may be ready to use magic on your own,” she said.

“Really?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Teddy, “but Merlin is very cautious about sharing magic powers with mortals, even with two as worthy as you. He is also wary of magic being used outside the realm of Camelot. Nevertheless, Morgan has convinced Merlin to let you prove yourselves. You will be tested on four missions.”

“But we don’t know any magic,” said Jack.

“Remember what I told you on our last adventure?” said Teddy. “If we all work together—”

“Anything is possible!” said Annie. “But you just said you weren’t coming with us.”

“That is true,” said Kathleen. “And that is why we bring you this.” She reached into a pocket of her cloak and pulled out a small handmade book. She gave the book to Annie.

The cover of the book was made of rough brown paper. Written on it in neat, simple handwriting was the title:



“You made this for us?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. “One line of each rhyme is in Teddy’s language, and one is in mine, the language of the Seal People.”

Annie opened the book to the table of contents. She and Jack skimmed the list of rhymes, and Jack read some of the entries aloud:

“Fly Through the Air Make. Metal Soft.

Turn into Ducks—”

Annie giggled. “These are so cool!” she said. “Let’s all turn into ducks!”

“Not now,” said Kathleen. “You must use these rhymes very sparingly. There are only ten rhymes in the book, and each can only be used once. They are meant to last you for four journeys.”

“Four?” said Jack.

“Aye,” said Teddy. “Merlin has agreed that if you can use our magic wisely on four missions, he will teach you the secrets that will allow you to make magic on your own.”

“Oh, boy!” said Annie.

Jack put the book of magic rhymes in his backpack. “So where are we going on our first mission?” he asked.

“This research book from Morgan will tell you,” said Teddy. He took out a book and handed it to Jack. The cover showed a bright, colorful city surrounded by water.

Jack read the title aloud:





A VISIT TO VENICE, ITALY.


“I’ve heard of Venice,” said Annie. “Last year Aunt Gail and Uncle Michael went there on vacation.”

“Aye, ’tis a city that has long welcomed travelers,” said Teddy. “But you and Jack will travel to the Venice of two hundred sixty years ago.”

“What will we do there?” asked Jack.

“Merlin has prepared careful directions for you,” said Teddy. He pulled a letter out of a pocket in his cloak and gave it to Jack. “Read this when you get to Venice.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He put Merlin’s letter and Morgan’s research book into his backpack.

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “If we take the tree house to Venice, how will you guys get back to Camelot?”

Teddy and Kathleen smiled and held up their hands. They each wore a ring made of pale blue glass. “These magic rings belong to Morgan,” said Kathleen. “They will take us home.”

“Remember,” Teddy said to Jack and Annie. “Follow Merlin’s directions carefully. If you prove yourselves to be wise and brave helpers, he will call for you again soon.”

Kathleen nodded. “Good-bye now,” she said to Jack and Annie. “Good luck.”

Kathleen and Teddy raised their glass rings to their lips. Together they whispered words too softly to be heard, then blew on the rings.

Before Jack and Annie’s eyes, the two young sorcerers began to fade into the cool morning air. In an instant, they had disappeared completely.

“They’re gone,” breathed Jack.

“I guess it’s time for us to go, too,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath. Then he pointed at the cover of the Venice book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Carnival at Candlelight is the fifth book in a group of Magic Tree House books called the “Merlin Missions.” On their first four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie traveled to mythical lands, where many magical things took place. I love writing books that take place in fantasy worlds, but I also love writing books about real life. So the next Merlin Missions will combine the two—Jack and Annie will have fantasy adventures in real places in real times.

One of the most amazing places I’ve ever been is the city of Venice, Italy. Venice is a group of islands in a lagoon between the Italian mainland and the Adriatic Sea. The water, the art, the architecture, the atmosphere—all make Venice one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Writing a Magic Tree House adventure set in Venice meant that I could return there in my imagination every day for many months. Working on this book was a very exciting journey. I invite you now to share my journey and discover the mystery and magic of Venice for yourself.

For Gail Hochman, of course






I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;

A palace and a prison on each hand:

I saw from out the wave her structures rise

As from the stroke of the enchanter’s wand…

—Lord Byron, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage



1. A Book of Magic

Dawn was breaking in the Frog Creek woods. Jack saw a light shining up ahead. He ran toward it. He ran so fast, he couldn’t hear his feet hitting the ground. He couldn’t feel the frosty winter air.

As Jack got closer to the light, he could see the magic tree house at the top of the tallest oak. A girl and boy were looking out the window. The girl had dark, wavy hair and sea-blue eyes. The boy had tousled red hair and a big grin on his face. As the two kids waved at him, Jack felt incredibly happy.

“Jack, wake up!”

Jack opened his eyes. His sister, Annie, was standing beside his bed. She was wearing her winter jacket. It was barely light outside.

“I just had a dream about the tree house,” she said.

“Really?” Jack said sleepily.

“I dreamed we were running through the woods at dawn,” said Annie, “and when we got to the tree house, Teddy and Kathleen were there waiting for us.”

Jack sat up. “I just had the same dream!” he said.

“Meet you downstairs,” said Annie.

Annie left Jack’s room. Jack jumped out of bed, put on his glasses, and threw on his clothes. He grabbed his winter jacket and his backpack. Then he slipped quietly down the stairs and out the front door.

Annie was waiting on the porch. The February air was chilly. Frost sparkled in the grass as the sun rose over the Frog Creek woods.

“Ready?” asked Annie.

Jack nodded and zipped his jacket. Without another word, he and Annie hurried up their street and headed into the woods. They ran through the long shadows of early morning, between the bare winter trees. Then they stopped.

The tree house was back, just as Jack had seen it in his dream! It was high in the tallest oak tree, shining in the cold morning light.

“Wow,” breathed Jack. “Dreams can come true.”

“Yep,” said Annie. “Teddy! Kathleen!”

No one answered.

“I guess only part of this dream came true,” Annie said sadly. She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed. Annie climbed into the tree house. “Oh, wow!” she said.

“What is it?” said Jack.

“They’re here!” said Annie in a loud whisper. Jack climbed in behind her. Their friends Teddy and Kathleen, apprentices to Morgan le Fay, were sitting under the tree house window. Wrapped in heavy woolen cloaks, they were both fast asleep.

“Hey, sleepyheads!” said Annie. “Wake up!”

Kathleen blinked and yawned. Teddy rubbed his eyes. When he saw Jack and Annie, he gave them a wide grin and leapt to his feet. “Hello!” he said.

“Hello!” cried Annie. She threw her arms around Teddy. “We both dreamed you were here.”

“Ah, then our magic worked!” said Teddy. “Kathleen suggested we send dreams to let you know we were here, and it seems our magic sent us to dreamland as well.”

“But now we are all awake,” said Kathleen. “And I am very glad to see you.” She stood up, drawing her cloak around her. Her blue eyes sparkled like seawater in the dawn light.

“I’m glad to see you, too,” Jack said shyly.

“Are you taking us on another Merlin Mission?” said Annie.

“Not exactly,” said Teddy. “Merlin has a most important mission for you. But this time, we will not be going along.”

“Oh, no!” said Annie. “What if we need your magic to help us?”

Teddy and Kathleen looked at each other and smiled. Then Kathleen turned back to Jack and Annie. “Morgan thinks you may be ready to use magic on your own,” she said.

“Really?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Teddy, “but Merlin is very cautious about sharing magic powers with mortals, even with two as worthy as you. He is also wary of magic being used outside the realm of Camelot. Nevertheless, Morgan has convinced Merlin to let you prove yourselves. You will be tested on four missions.”

“But we don’t know any magic,” said Jack.

“Remember what I told you on our last adventure?” said Teddy. “If we all work together—”

“Anything is possible!” said Annie. “But you just said you weren’t coming with us.”

“That is true,” said Kathleen. “And that is why we bring you this.” She reached into a pocket of her cloak and pulled out a small handmade book. She gave the book to Annie.

The cover of the book was made of rough brown paper. Written on it in neat, simple handwriting was the title:



“You made this for us?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. “One line of each rhyme is in Teddy’s language, and one is in mine, the language of the Seal People.”

Annie opened the book to the table of contents. She and Jack skimmed the list of rhymes, and Jack read some of the entries aloud:

“Fly Through the Air Make. Metal Soft.

Turn into Ducks—”

Annie giggled. “These are so cool!” she said. “Let’s all turn into ducks!”

“Not now,” said Kathleen. “You must use these rhymes very sparingly. There are only ten rhymes in the book, and each can only be used once. They are meant to last you for four journeys.”

“Four?” said Jack.

“Aye,” said Teddy. “Merlin has agreed that if you can use our magic wisely on four missions, he will teach you the secrets that will allow you to make magic on your own.”

“Oh, boy!” said Annie.

Jack put the book of magic rhymes in his backpack. “So where are we going on our first mission?” he asked.

“This research book from Morgan will tell you,” said Teddy. He took out a book and handed it to Jack. The cover showed a bright, colorful city surrounded by water.

Jack read the title aloud:





A VISIT TO VENICE, ITALY.


“I’ve heard of Venice,” said Annie. “Last year Aunt Gail and Uncle Michael went there on vacation.”

“Aye, ’tis a city that has long welcomed travelers,” said Teddy. “But you and Jack will travel to the Venice of two hundred sixty years ago.”

“What will we do there?” asked Jack.

“Merlin has prepared careful directions for you,” said Teddy. He pulled a letter out of a pocket in his cloak and gave it to Jack. “Read this when you get to Venice.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He put Merlin’s letter and Morgan’s research book into his backpack.

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “If we take the tree house to Venice, how will you guys get back to Camelot?”

Teddy and Kathleen smiled and held up their hands. They each wore a ring made of pale blue glass. “These magic rings belong to Morgan,” said Kathleen. “They will take us home.”

“Remember,” Teddy said to Jack and Annie. “Follow Merlin’s directions carefully. If you prove yourselves to be wise and brave helpers, he will call for you again soon.”

Kathleen nodded. “Good-bye now,” she said to Jack and Annie. “Good luck.”

Kathleen and Teddy raised their glass rings to their lips. Together they whispered words too softly to be heard, then blew on the rings.

Before Jack and Annie’s eyes, the two young sorcerers began to fade into the cool morning air. In an instant, they had disappeared completely.

“They’re gone,” breathed Jack.

“I guess it’s time for us to go, too,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath. Then he pointed at the cover of the Venice book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Carnival

Annie laughed.

Jack opened his eyes. He and Annie were wearing purple and pink outfits with huge ruffled collars. On their heads were funny hats. On their feet were red slippers with big bows.

“Who are we?” Annie asked.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He didn’t feel like a wise and brave helper in his red slippers. He felt stupid.

Together Jack and Annie looked out the tree house window. They had landed in a small tree inside a walled garden. The sky was gray. Jack couldn’t tell if it was morning or evening, but the air felt damp and heavy, as if a storm was about to break.

“I guess this is Venice,” he said.

“Let’s check our book,” said Annie. She opened their research book and read aloud:

Today the city of Venice (say VEN-iss) is one of the most popular tourist spots in the world. It lies in a lagoon of the Adriatic Sea. Instead of roads, Venice has waterways called canals. People glide along the canals in shallow boats called gondolas (GON-duh-luz). A man called a gondolier (gon-duh-LEER) stands in the back of the boat and uses a long oar to propel the gondola through the water.



“That sounds like fun,” said Jack.

“Yep,” said Annie. She closed the book. “Let’s go.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “We don’t even know what our mission is yet.” He took out Merlin’s letter and unfolded it. He read aloud:



Jack pushed his glasses into place. “Hmm,” he said.

“I wonder who the Grand Lady is,” said Annie. “And why do we need to save her?”

“I’m wondering lots of stuff,” said Jack. “What about the King of the Jungle? We’re in a city, not a jungle. And what about that angel? And—”

“Let’s just take one thing at a time,” said Annie. “What are we supposed to do first?”

Jack looked back at the letter and read:

When waters rise beneath the moon,

Visit the Grand Lady of the Lagoon.

“So let’s start by finding the Grand Lady,” said Annie. She headed down the tree house ladder.

Jack put Merlin’s letter into his backpack, along with Morgan’s research book and Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes. Then he climbed down the rope ladder and caught up with Annie.

Jack and Annie walked over a pebbly path as the sky darkened. Good, thought Jack. It’s night. He didn’t want anyone to see him in his silly outfit—especially the red slippers with the bows.

“That must be the way out,” said Annie. She led Jack to a wooden gate in the garden wall and pushed it open.

Jack and Annie stepped through the gate onto a quiet, empty walkway. Next to the walkway was a narrow lane of water.

“I guess that’s a canal,” said Jack.

“And that must be a gondola,” said Annie. She pointed to a long, curved black boat rounding the corner. In the last light of day, the gondola was gliding silently up the canal toward them.

“Yikes,” whispered Annie.

There were two people in the boat—a gondolier and a passenger. Each wore a black cloak, white gloves, and a ghostly white mask. The masks had long, pointy noses shaped like bird beaks. The passenger sat in the middle of the boat, holding a lantern. The gondolier stood in the back, pushing a long oar through the water.

“They look a lot weirder than us,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack.

“Hello!” the passenger shouted.



The person’s voice was muffled behind the white mask. “Do you need help?”

“Yes!” Annie shouted back. “Can you take us to the Grand Lady of the Lagoon?”

“Yes, of course. She is back that way!” answered the masked passenger. “Come.”

“Great!” said Annie. She grabbed Jack’s hand and pulled him over to the gondola. The gondola rocked a bit as she and Jack climbed aboard and took seats between the gondolier and the passenger.

The gondolier pushed the gondola away from the landing. His long oar made soft splashes in the water as the boat moved up the canal.

Jack cleared his throat. “Um, excuse me,” he said. “Why are you wearing bird masks?”

“For Carnival, of course,” said the passenger. “That is why you are wearing clown costumes, no?”

“Oh, yeah, sure,” said Jack.

As the gondola slid through the canal, Jack snuck their research book out of his backpack.

“Oh, boy, a carnival!” Annie whispered to Jack. “I hope it has a roller coaster.”

“I don’t think they had roller coasters two hundred sixty years ago,” whispered Jack.

Jack looked up carnival in the index. He found the page. Then he and Annie silently read together:

For many centuries, Carnival has been the most famous yearly festival of Venice. For Carnival, people disguise themselves as anything they want to be. Rich, poor, male, female, young, and old—all are equal during Carnival.



“Look, that’s us,” whispered Annie. She pointed to a picture of a colorful costume with a white ruffled collar and red slippers with bows.

“Yeah, and that’s them,” whispered Jack. He pointed to a picture of a person dressed in a black cloak and a white mask with a bird’s beak.

Jack closed the book and put it away. The gondola people didn’t seem so weird anymore. But he still wondered why a grand lady was in terrible danger at Carnival.

As the boat glided around a bend, Jack caught his breath. He saw dozens of gondolas rocking on the choppy waters of a wide, open canal. They were all decorated with ribbons and flowers. Candlelight from their lanterns danced on the dark, rippling water.

“Look, that must be Carnival over there,” said Annie, pointing.

In the distance, thousands of candles twinkled along the shoreline. Sounds of laughter, clapping, and shouting floated over the water.

“Hold on tightly!” said the masked person in the front of the gondola. “The tide is high tonight!” As their gondola joined the fleet of boats heading toward Carnival, the wind picked up. The waves grew taller.

Jack and Annie held on to the sides of the boat. Jack heard a faint rumble of faraway thunder. He saw a zigzag flash of lightning in the distant sky. Is a storm coming? he wondered nervously. Is the storm part of the disaster that’s going to happen to the Grand Lady of the Lagoon?

“This is going to be fun, isn’t it?” said Annie cheerfully.

“Sure,” said Jack. He tried to shake off his worries as the wind and tide helped push the gondola toward the twinkling candles of Carnival.



3. The Grand Lady, of the Lagoon

The gondola glided toward a landing at the edge of the canal. As the gondolier tied up the boat, water was sloshing from the canal onto a wide walkway filled with Carnival-goers.

The gondolier reached a gloved hand toward Annie and helped her out of the boat. He then held out a hand to Jack. When Jack grabbed it, he was surprised that the gondolier’s hand felt small under the white glove, like a kid’s hand.

As soon as Jack had stepped out of the boat, the gondolier untied the rope, pushed off from the landing, and began rowing away.

“Bye! Thanks!” called Annie.

The two strangers in the white bird masks waved.

Jack and Annie watched the gondola disappear over the choppy waters. Then they looked back at the shore. The Carnival crowd was parading up and down the wide walkway along the canal.

“Hey look,” said Annie. “There’s a bunch of people dressed like us! And like the two people in our gondola!”

Jack saw lots of black cloaks, bird masks, funny hats, and ruffled collars. He also saw people dressed as chickens, pirates, and knights. None of the costumed people seemed to mind the water spilling over the edge of the canal, soaking their boots and slippers.

As Jack and Annie stared at the crowd, a distant bell began to ring. The bell rang nine times. “I guess that means it’s nine o’clock,” said Jack.

Just then another bell began to chime. Jack counted again. This time, ten chimes rang out. “Ten?” said Jack, puzzled. “So what time is it? Nine o’clock or ten o’clock?”

“Don’t worry about that now,” said Annie. “I think I see the Grand Lady of the Lagoon!”

“Where?” said Jack.

Annie pointed to a tall woman at the edge of the parade. She was wearing a black mask. She wore piles of jewelry, a white wig, and a wide hoop skirt.

Jack and Annie moved toward the lady. “Excuse me,” said Annie. “Hi.”

The lady looked at Annie. “Hello,” she said in a deep man’s voice.

“Whoa,” said Jack, stepping back.

Annie laughed. “You’re a man!” she said.

“Of course,” said the man. “But for Carnival, I am a very beautiful lady, no?”

“We’re looking for someone called the Grand Lady of—” started Annie. But before she could finish, a giant chicken grabbed the man’s hand and pulled him away into the crowd.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack, looking around. Lots of people were dressed as grand ladies! “How are we supposed to know who to visit?”

“Maybe it’s time to use one of Kathleen and Teddy’s rhymes,” said Annie.

“No, we should save our rhymes,” said Jack.

“Then let’s just skip visiting the Grand Lady of the Lagoon for now,” said Annie. “What’s the next thing Merlin tells us to do?”

Jack looked at Merlin’s directions and read aloud:

To find out where you need to go,

Seek out a painter named Tiepolo.

“Good, that’s clear,” said Jack. “Let’s see if Tiepolo is in our research book.”

As the noisy crowd celebrated around them, Jack pulled out the book. He stood near a lantern and looked in the index. “He’s here!” said Jack. He turned to the right page and read:

Tiepolo (say tee-EP-uh-lo) was one of the greatest painters of Venice in the 1700s. He painted bright, beautiful oil paintings for palaces and villas.



“If the guy’s so famous, people must know where he lives,” said Annie. “Excuse me!” she called to a clown walking by. “Can you tell us where the painter Tiepolo lives?”

“Near the Church of San Felice,” the clown said.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

“But you won’t find him home now,” the clown called over his shoulder. “He’s in Milan, painting.”

“Where’s that?” shouted Jack.

“Over a day’s ride on horseback,” said the clown. Then he disappeared into the crowd.

“Hmmm …,” said Annie. “Do you think Merlin wants us to go to Milan?”

“We don’t have time,” said Jack. “I think we have to skip Tiepolo, too.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “Hey, maybe we should just skip all this stuff and try to find the Ruler of the Seas on our own. Our letter says he’s the only one who can help us save the Grand Lady.”

“I don’t know …,” said Jack. “In his letter, Merlin tells us to be patient—”

But Annie was already calling to a pirate passing by. “Sir, do you know where we can find the Ruler of the Seas?”

“What?” shouted the pirate.

“The ruler! Do you know where he lives?” yelled Annie.

“In the palace on Saint Mark’s Square!” said the pirate.

“Where’s that?” Annie called. But the pirate had disappeared into the crowd.

“I’ll look up Saint Mark’s Square,” said Jack. He turned the pages of their book until he came to a map of Venice. “Oh, cool,” he said. Jack loved maps.

“Okay, let’s see,” Jack said. “We’re here.” He pointed to the walkway along the canal on the map. “And we want to go to Saint Mark’s Square.” He pointed to another place on the map. “It’s really close.”

“Yeah, and it looks like everyone else is headed there, too,” said Annie. “Come on.”

“So, if we go this way …,” said Jack. He traced their route with his finger.

“Come on, Jack!” called Annie.

Jack looked up from the map. Annie was already walking with the crowd. Jack closed the book and hurried after her. Soon they came to a huge, open square.

“Wow,” Jack said breathlessly. Saint Mark’s Square was filled with candlelight and musicians. Acrobats balanced on tightropes. Boxers boxed in a ring. Knights fenced with swords. Clowns walked on tall stilts, raced wheelbarrows, and tried to catch live eels in their mouths. All around the square were candlelit buildings.

“Venice is beautiful,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He looked back at their book. He found an illustration of Saint Mark’s Square. Jack read the descriptions of the buildings:

The watchtower of Saint Mark’s Square is the tallest building in Venice. The weather vane on top once helped sailors by showing them which way the wind was blowing.



Jack looked up. “I can barely see the weather vane up there,” he said. “But I think it’s pointing north. So the wind must be blowing from the south.”

“What about the ruler’s palace? Where’s that?” asked Annie.

Jack read on:

The clock tower is one of the most beautiful towers in the world. On top of the tower, a bell is struck every hour by—



“Jack, skip to the ruler’s palace!” interrupted Annie. “Please!”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He read about the palace:



The palace of Venice’s ruler is one of the most splendid structures ever built. It has a great hall where as many as 2,000 nobles once met to discuss city matters. It also holds the city’s grim prison cells. Above the palace door is a sculpture of Saint Mark showing a book to a winged lion—



“There’s the palace door!” said Annie.

Jack looked up from the map. Annie was heading toward a huge door with the sculpture of a man and a winged lion above it. Jack closed the book and hurried to catch up to her.

A guard was standing by the palace door. The guard wore a uniform and held a rifle. “Wait,” Jack whispered. “Is he a real guard? Or is that just a costume?”

“I’ll find out,” said Annie. She walked over to the guard. “Excuse me, sir. Is the ruler of Venice inside the palace now?”

“Begone, clown!” the guard said gruffly.

“But it’s important,” said Annie. “We need to talk to him about something.”

“I said begone!” the guard growled. “I am tired of clowns wasting my time!”

“She’s not really a clown,” said Jack, coming forward. “We’re on a mission. We—”

“Go! Both of you! Or else!” roared the guard. He held up his rifle. He’s definitely not wearing a costume, thought Jack.

“Okay, sorry, sorry,” said Jack. He and Annie moved away from the palace entrance.

“What a grouchy guy,” said Annie.

“He’ll never let us in,” said Jack.

“Maybe it’s time to use one of Teddy and Kathleen’s rhymes,” said Annie. “Maybe we should turn into ducks. The guard wouldn’t mind if a couple of ducks—”

“No,” said Jack. “We have to save our rhymes.”

“Well, how will we get inside?” Annie asked.

“Patience,” said Jack. “Remember—”

Before he could finish, Annie broke in, “Hey, look!”

Two clowns on stilts were dancing around the guard. One grabbed the guard’s rifle and tossed it to the other.

“Hey!” the guard yelled. “Give that back!”

“Now’s our chance!” said Annie. “Quick!” She ran to the entrance and slipped through the door.

“Oh, no—oh, man!” said Jack. While the guard chased after the two clowns on stilts, Jack rushed to the doorway of the palace and slipped inside, too.


4. Rats!


Jack found Annie standing behind a column in a lantern-lit courtyard. The courtyard was quiet and empty. “Everyone in Venice must be at Carnival,” said Jack. “I just hope the ruler is home.”

“Yeah, we’ll ask him if he knows the Grand Lady of the Lagoon,” said Annie. “And we’ll tell him he has to help us save her from a terrible disaster.”

Jack looked at his map of the palace. Several rooms were labeled Ruler’s Living Chambers. “I guess that’s where he lives,” said Jack. “We have to go up some stairs called the Giants’ Stairs to get there.”



“The Giants’ Stairs?” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Listen to this.”

These stairs are called the Giants’ Stairs because they are guarded by two large statues of gods from Roman mythology: Mars, the god of war, and Neptune, the god of the sea.



“Cool,” said Annie. “Let’s go.”

Jack and Annie hurried down the passageway that ran along the courtyard until they came to a wide staircase. On either side of the stairs were giant marble statues of strong-looking men.

“Mars and Neptune,” said Jack. “This is it. Come on.”

Jack and Annie quickly climbed the Giants’ Stairs. At the top, Jack looked at the map again. “Now we turn right and head for the Golden Staircase,” he said.

Keeping an eye out for more guards, they crept down a hall until they came to a fancy staircase under a gold ceiling.

“There it is,” said Jack. “Let’s climb up.” He and Annie hurried up the Golden Staircase. When they got to the top, they froze. Another guard was slouched against the wall by the stairs. His eyes were closed, and he was snoring softly.

Jack motioned to Annie, and they tiptoed past the sleeping guard to the entrance of the ruler’s living chambers. Jack glanced at the map. “This is it,” he whispered.

The door was open. Jack and Annie peeked inside. “Knock, knock?” Annie said in a soft voice.

No one answered.

They stepped through the doorway. A fire blazed on the hearth. Overhead many candles burned brightly. The dancing flames cast shadows on a marble floor and a carved gold ceiling.

“I have a feeling the ruler’s not here,” said Annie. “Maybe we should leave.”

Jack looked at their book. “Wait, the next room is the Map Room,” he said. “Let’s just take a look.”

“Okay, but we’d better hurry,” said Annie.

Jack led the way into the Map Room. Colorful maps hung on the walls. In the middle of the floor were two huge globes. Jack sighed. “I love this room,” he said.

“Look, more lions,” said Annie. She pointed to three paintings of winged lions on one of the walls. “Why are there lions with wings everywhere?”

Jack looked up winged lions in their book. He turned to the right page and read:

The winged lion is the symbol of Venice. Represented in paintings and sculptures all over the city, the lions stand for strength on both land and sea.



As Jack and Annie looked back up at the lion paintings, they heard footsteps. The grouchy guard and the sleepy guard rushed into the room.

“Hi, we’re looking—” began Annie.

“There they are! The thieves!” the sleepy guard shouted at the grouchy guard. “I told you I heard voices!”

“We’re not thieves,” said Annie. “We were just looking for your ruler to ask for his help.”

“She’s right,” said Jack. “We have to tell him that—”

“Won’t admit your crime, eh?” said the grouchy guard. “The worst cells are reserved for criminals like you! Move!”

“But we—” started Annie.

“Move!” shouted the grouchy guard, raising his rifle and pointing to the door.

Jack knew there was no use arguing. He took Annie’s hand and led her out of the ruler’s living chambers. The two guards walked behind them, pointing guns at their backs.

“To the end of the hall and down the steps!” growled the grouchy guard.

Jack and Annie walked quickly down the hall, then down some steep, narrow steps. They moved through a low stone corridor, the guards close behind them.

“Over the Bridge of Sighs!” shouted the grouchy guard. “And be sure to sigh when you cross it—because you won’t be coming back for a long time!”

Jack gripped Annie’s hand as they crossed a covered footbridge to another building. Once inside, they started down a lantern-lit hallway filled with puddles. Jack’s shoes felt squishy and soggy as he sloshed through the water.

“Halt!” shouted the grouchy guard.

Jack and Annie stopped in front of a heavy wooden door. The grouchy guard opened the door and pushed them into a dark, damp cell.

The door slammed shut. Jack heard a heavy metal bolt clank into place. Then he heard the guards splash away down the hall, arguing with each other.

The prison was eerily quiet. It was hard to breathe in the stale cell. It was hard to see, too. Only the dim light of the hallway shone faintly through the barred window. Under the window was a wooden bench.

“What now?” Annie asked in a small voice.

For a moment, Jack couldn’t answer. He was stunned. Minutes ago they’d been at the bright Carnival. Now they were locked in a dingy prison cell. “I—I’ll look in the book,” he said.

Jack felt shaky as he opened their research book. He moved close to the barred window to read by the dim light. He looked up prison in the index. He found it and read aloud:

The prison cells at ground level in the palace were called the pozzi, meaning “wells” or “pits.” They were dank, airless, and filled with rats. Even the government eventually decided they were too cruel.



Jack heard a squeak from a dark corner. He stopped reading and looked up. He heard the squeak again. The hair went up on his neck. Was that a rat? he wondered.

“Was that a rat?” said Annie.

The squeak came again from the dark corner. Then a squeak came from another corner. Jack heard rustling along the walls and more squeaking.

“Oh, man,” he breathed. There were rats everywhere.

“I think it’s time for magic,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack, “definitely.” He kept his eye on the dark corners while Annie reached into his backpack and pulled out Teddy and Kathleen’s book.

Annie read from the table of contents: “Make a Stone Come Alive. Make Metal Soft. Turn into Ducks.” Annie looked up. “Are rats afraid of ducks?” she asked.

“Forget ducks!” said Jack. “Go back to Make Metal Soft—that’s what we need to do! You read the rhyme, and I’ll try to pull the bars apart.”

“Okay, good,” said Annie.

Jack jumped onto the wooden bench under the barred window. The squeaking grew louder.

Jack reached up and felt the iron bars. They were cold and hard and very solid. Jack couldn’t imagine bending them.

The squeaks were getting louder. Jack gripped two bars in the middle of the window and took a deep breath. “Read the rhyme!” he said.

Annie read aloud:

Iron or copper, brass or steel,

Bree-on-saw! Bro-on-beel!

As Annie finished the rhyme, the bars began to glow. They grew warmer in Jack’s hands. “I think it’s working!” he cried.

Holding the bars tightly Jack pulled in opposite directions. Slowly the glowing bars began to stretch and bend. Jack pulled till there was an opening large enough for Annie and him to fit through.



“We did it!” he cried.

“Great! Hurry, hurry! The rats are coming!” cried Annie as she jumped on the bench.

Jack heard a chorus of squeaks from all sides of the cell. He looked down. He saw the shadowy shapes of dozens of rats. They seemed to be sniffing the air below the window.

“Go! Go!” Jack cried to Annie.

Annie squeezed between the bars and jumped down into the hallway. Jack followed her. He hit the wet floor and scrambled to his feet. “Come on!” he cried.

Jack and Annie sloshed down the watery hallway. At the end of it, they nearly bumped right into the two guards. Jack and Annie kept running.

“Hey!” the grouchy guard shouted, running after them. He reached for Jack. The other guard tried to catch Annie.



Jack and Annie dodged away from them. The guards crashed into each other, falling to the floor. Jack and Annie kept running. They dashed across the Bridge of Sighs. They ran through the corridor and up the steep stone steps.

“This way!” cried Jack. He and Annie tore down the hall, heading for the Golden Staircase.

“Hey! Hey!” the guards yelled from far behind.

Jack and Annie bounded down the Golden Staircase two steps at a time. They flew down the hall and down the Giants’ Stairs. They ran past the statues of Mars and Neptune and charged down the long, open passageway. Finally, they dashed through the entrance of the palace and escaped into Saint Mark’s Square.

6. Disaster


“We have to save all of Venice?” said Jack. “That’s a big responsibility. What do we have to save Venice from?”

“Well, if Neptune’s going to help us, it must have something to do with water,” said Annie.

“Yeah, like the water that’s flooding the alleys,” said Jack.

“But the woman at the café told us not to worry about that,” said Annie.

“I’m still worried,” said Jack. “Let’s look up floods in our Venice book.” He found floods in the index. He turned to the right page and read:

Most of the time, high water in Venice is not serious. But if several conditions are present at the same time, a flood disaster can occur.



“A flood disaster! That must be it!” said Annie. “So what are the conditions?”

“It lists them here,” said Jack. He read:

A high tide

Strong winds from the south

Heavy flow of water from the mountains

Severe storms at sea



“There’s a high tide tonight—the passenger with the bird mask in the gondola told us that,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and winds from the south—the weather vane told us that,” said Jack.

“And water’s flowing down from the mountains—the woman at the café told us that,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and storms out at sea—I saw lightning when we crossed the water,” said Jack.

“All the conditions are here,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie looked around. Water was now flowing steadily from the alleyways into the small square. It had risen above their ankles.

“I get it now,” said Jack. “The water will just keep getting higher and higher until it destroys the whole city. And no one’s paying attention!”

“Neptune’s the only one who can help us stop the flood,” said Annie.

“But Neptune’s not real,” said Jack. “I mean, he’s a character in mythology, and mythology’s not real life. It’s—”

“Okay, okay,” said Annie. “Let’s just take one step at a time. At midnight two guys will tell us the time, and then we should climb to the top of their tower, right?”

“Right,” said Jack.

“So what we have to do now is find those two guys!” said Annie.

“Let’s go back to the waterfront,” said Jack. “The man with the dog said everyone in Venice would be there for the fireworks.”

Jack put away their book. Then he and Annie retraced their steps over the footbridge and back through the alleys. Lots of seaweed was floating in the narrow lanes between buildings. Water is definitely flowing in from the sea, Jack thought.

When they got back to Saint Mark’s Square, people were streaming toward the waterfront. Jack and Annie walked with the crowd. Everyone was talking and laughing as they looked up at the sky over the water, waiting for the fireworks to begin. No one paid attention to the damp winds or the seawater spilling over the side of the canal, soaking their shoes.

“Excuse me!” Annie shouted. “Can anyone tell us the time?”

No one answered, for just then the first explosion of fireworks shook the night. The crowd cheered as blue and red showers exploded in the sky.

In the distance, a clock started to chime. Jack counted the bongs.

“Twelve!” he said. “It’s midnight now, according to that clock.”

More fireworks exploded over the waterfront, and another clock began clanging. This time, Jack counted only eleven bongs. He shook his head. “This is crazy!” he muttered.

Jack looked around at the crowd. “Can anyone tell us the real time?” he yelled. “Is it midnight yet? Can anyone tell us?”

No one answered—not even one man, much less two. Everyone was oohing and aahing over the dazzling fireworks.

Another clock began to sound. This one was much louder than the first two.

BONG!

“This is hopeless!” said Jack.

BONG!

“We’ll never know the right time,” he said.

BONG!

“Jack, look over there—” said Annie.



BONG!

“We’ll never find the two men with the tower,” said Jack.

BONG!

“Jack, look—” said Annie.

BONG!

“All of Venice is about to drown in a flood,” said Jack.

BONG!

“And everyone’s just cheering for fireworks!” said Jack.

BONG!

“JACK! LOOK!” said Annie. She pointed toward the clock tower in Saint Mark’s Square.

BONG!

Jack saw a huge bell on top of the tower. Two bronze statues were holding a club and striking the bell.

BONG!

The statues were of two men.

BONG!

“At midnight two men will tell you the time,” said Annie.

BONG!

The two men struck the bell for the twelfth time and then stopped.

“Come on!” cried Jack. “We have to climb that tower!”

More fireworks thundered over the canal as Jack and Annie pushed their way back through the crowd. They ran into Saint Mark’s Square and splashed their way to the tall tower with the two men on top. They ran to the arched entrance of the tower and stepped inside. The air was damp and musty.

“Stairs!” said Jack. He ran to a dark, winding stairway and started up. Annie followed. They climbed and climbed until they reached the top of the tower.

Jack was breathing hard as he pushed open a heavy door that led out onto the bell terrace. The two statues were frozen on either side of the bronze bell.

As soon as Jack and Annie stepped onto the terrace, the wind blew their hats off their heads. The air was filled with cracking and hissing sounds as more fireworks burst through the sky. Everyone on the waterfront was clapping and cheering.

“What’s the next thing Merlin tells us to do to find Neptune?” Annie shouted.

Jack pulled out Merlin’s letter. Holding on to it tightly as it flapped in the wind, he read aloud:

The King of the Jungle will carry you there,

Not over land, but high in the air.

“The King of the Jungle is a lion,” said Annie. “So it sounds like we need to find a flying lion!”

“Right,” said Jack. “But where?”

“How about that one?” said Annie. She was pointing over the terrace railing.

Jack looked down. Standing on the wide ledge below was the stone statue of a lion. Growing out of the lion’s back were two powerful-looking carved wings.

“But that’s just a statue,” cried Jack. “How can a statue take us anywhere?”

Annie grinned. “I think it’s time to use a little more magic,” she said.


7. The King and the Ruler


“Oh, yeah. Of course,” whispered Jack. He’d forgotten all about Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes!

Jack pulled the book out of his backpack. He and Annie studied the table of contents. “Make a Stone Come Alive,” said Annie. “Make Metal Soft. Turn into Ducks. Fly Through the Air— that’s it!”

“No,” said Jack. “Go back to Make a Stone Come Alive.”

“Why?” said Annie.

“Because the lion’s supposed to carry us,” said Jack, “and he already has wings. But he’s made of stone. So what we need to do is make him come alive.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

“But then what?” said Jack. “Where will we go?”

“Merlin’s letter said an angel of gold would show us the way, remember?” said Annie.

“Angel of gold?” said Jack. “Where are we going to find that? And how will we find Neptune? How will he help us save Venice?”

“Patience” said Annie. “If we need more magic, we’ll go back to the book.”

“Okay. But let’s hurry,” said Jack. He opened Teddy and Kathleen’s book to the second rhyme. He took a deep breath. He looked down at the lion on the ledge. Then he read in a loud, clear voice:

Stone so silent, cold, and hard,

Cum-matta-lie, cum-matta-skaard!



A cracking sound seemed to come from deep within the lion’s body. As Jack and Annie peered down at the statue, the lion’s stone mane ruffled into a mass of shaggy fur. His stone back softened into a sleek golden coat. His stone wings stretched into long, luminous feathers.

“Wow,” breathed Annie. Jack couldn’t speak. Before their eyes, the statue had turned into a living lion with magnificent golden wings. The lion shook his mane and yawned. He had huge, sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. His ears twitched. His tufted tail swayed back and forth.

The lion crouched and leapt off the ledge like a cat. He spread his wings and caught a strong current of wind. His wings flapped, and he began circling above the square.

“Here! Here!” Annie shouted. She waved wildly.

The winged lion turned and flew back toward the tower. He glided silently onto the terrace, landing just a few feet away from Jack and Annie. He stared at them with his golden eyes.

“You have to help us save Venice from a flood disaster,” Jack said.

“Can you carry us to Neptune?” said Annie.

The lion padded toward them. He kept staring straight at them. He tilted his tremendous head and let out a long growl, as if he was trying to answer.

“We have to climb on your back,” said Jack.

“I hope we won’t hurt you,” said Annie.

The lion let out another growl, but he didn’t sound angry. He sounded as if he was telling them to hurry. He crouched down so they could climb on.

“I’ll go first,” Jack said to Annie. “I’ll hold on to his mane, and you hold on to me.” Jack slipped off his backpack and dropped it onto the terrace.

“Take the book of rhymes,” said Annie.

“Got it,” said Jack. He tucked the book under his arm and carefully climbed onto the lion’s back.

Annie climbed on behind Jack and wrapped her arms tightly around his waist. Jack twisted his fingers into the lion’s mane. The mane felt surprisingly soft.

“Okay we’re ready” said Jack.

The lion stood up. He trembled slightly. Then he leapt off the terrace.



“Ahh!” Jack yelled. The rhyme book slipped from under his arm and fell down into the flooded square below.

“Oh, no! Our book!” cried Jack.

“Hang on!” cried Annie.

The lion flapped his great wings and rose through the sky. Jack pressed his knees into the lion’s warm back and clung to his mane.

The lion flew toward the fireworks. A shower of red sparks was opening like an umbrella. Booms and whistles filled the night. Fiery bits rained down through the darkness, whistling into the canal.

“Help! We’re heading straight into the fireworks!” cried Annie.

The lion dipped and turned away from the fireworks. The red showers gave way to bursts of blue and green.

“Which way do we go?” shouted Annie.

As the lion flew back toward the square, Jack saw the gold weather vane on top of the watchtower. It was in the shape of an angel.

“The angel of gold!” shouted Jack.

The weather vane was no longer pointing north with the winds. The angel was turning slowly around and around, pointing in all directions.

“Fly closer to the angel!” shouted Annie.

The lion turned and flew toward the watchtower. As they drew near the golden angel, Jack called out, “Which way do we go? Which way?”

The weather vane turned in a full circle and then came to a complete stop. The angel was pointing toward the southeast, over the choppy water.

“To the sea!” Annie called over the wind.

The lion turned and soared into the wind, his strong wings shining like gold.

“Oh, wow!” cried Annie.

The flying lion glided past the fireworks and over the wide canal. Leaving Venice behind, he flew high over the stormy seas.

Jack gripped the lion’s mane with all his might. The lion sailed in and out of thick, fast-moving clouds. He flew above crashing waves and past bolts of lightning. He flew through screaming winds and pelting rain.

In the middle of the sea, far from land, the lion began circling above the water. “What’s he doing?” cried Jack.

“Looking for Neptune!” shouted Annie.

“But Neptune’s not real!” said Jack.

“I know!” shouted Annie. “We’ll have to use our imaginations! Like Lorenzo! Try to imagine Neptune!”

Jack tried to imagine Neptune, but he was too scared to think clearly.

“Neptune!” shouted Annie. “Rise from the water! Save Venice, Neptune! Help us!” Annie’s voice was lost in the wind.

Jack wrapped his arms around the lion’s neck. He buried his face in the lion’s mane. He tried desperately to imagine Neptune.

The lion let out a roar. With his hands under the lion’s throat, Jack felt as if he himself were roaring. The lion roared again. The roaring made Jack feel stronger and calmer. The details of Tiepolo’s painting came into his mind.

In his imagination, Jack saw Neptune, Ruler of the Seas, with his white beard and long hair, his strong arms and shoulders. He saw a lovely lady who was Venice, the Grand Lady of the Lagoon…. He saw Neptune giving the Grand Lady a gift….

“I see something!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes and sat up. “Where?” he cried.

“In the water!” said Annie.

Clinging to the lion’s mane, Jack peered down into the darkness below. Lightning flashed over the sea. Jack saw a huge three-pronged spear rising out of the foaming, churning waves.

The sea below the spear began to heave and billow. Lightning flashed again, and Jack saw a great mass of swirling seaweed rising from the waves. Not seaweed—hair! Jack realized. A man’s giant head and neck appeared above the surface of the water. Then the man’s massive shoulders, chest, and arms rose above the storm-tossed sea. The giant loomed high above them, as tall as a mountain.



“Neptune!” cried Annie.

The lion let out a roar and then another and another.

Lit by flashes of lightning, Neptune’s face looked as if it had been weathered by thousands of years of wind and sand and waves. He had deep-set eyes, craggy cheeks, a white beard, and tangled hair hanging to his shoulders.

“Neptune, save Venice from the flood!” cried Jack.

“Please!” called Annie. “Save the Grand Lady of the Lagoon!”

Neptune looked at them for a moment. Then, with his powerful arms, he lifted his spear and thrust it down into the waves. When the spear pierced the surface of the water, the sea made a gurgling sound—and then a long slurp, as if water were flowing down a drain.

The thunder and lightning stopped. The storm-tossed waves grew calm. The wind died to a gentle breeze. The clouds parted, and the stars shined brightly.

Neptune raised his spear. He nodded to Jack and Annie and the lion.

“Thanks!” cried Annie.

“Thanks!” shouted Jack. The lion roared again.

Then Neptune began to sink back into the sea. His long arms … huge shoulders … thick neck … craggy face … floating hair—all disappeared. The prongs of his spear sank below the surface of the water.

The Ruler of the Seas was gone. Only a shimmering whirlpool swirled in the moonlight.

9. The Painting


The gondolier silently helped Jack and Annie into the boat. Then he untied the gondola and pushed off from the landing.

As the boat glided through the shallow waters, Jack looked back at Venice. Bathed in early sunlight, the Grand Lady of the Lagoon did seem timeless.

The gondola moved around the bend and up the narrow canal near the walled garden. The gondolier tied the boat to a striped pole. He then offered his gloved hand to Annie to help her out of the boat. Annie climbed out and the gondolier offered his hand to Jack.

As the gondolier helped Jack onto the landing, the boat rocked in the water. Jack tripped, pulling the glove off the gondolier’s hand.



“Oh, sorry,” said Jack. As he handed the glove back, he gasped. On the gondolier’s finger was a pale blue glass ring.

Before Jack could say anything, the gondolier pulled his glove back on and pushed the boat away from the landing.

“Hey—hey!” Jack sputtered. “Teddy? Kathleen? Wait! Come back!”

Neither of the masked people looked back at Jack and Annie.

“Teddy and Kathleen? Where?” said Annie.

“His glove—it came off! There was a blue glass ring on his finger!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie watched the gondola disappear into a blaze of sunlight shining on the water. Had it just glided around the bend? Or had it vanished altogether?

“Are you sure it was them?” said Annie.

“Well, I guess anybody could wear a glass ring,” said Jack. “But still…”

“Maybe Morgan and Merlin told them to watch over us,” said Annie.

“Yeah, to make sure we’d be safe,” said Jack.

“And be patient and follow instructions,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “Well, Venice wasn’t destroyed by a flood. So I guess we passed our first test.”

“I think we did,” said Annie.

With Lorenzo’s canvas tucked under his arm, Jack led the way into the walled garden. Annie followed him to the rope ladder.

When they climbed into the tree house, Jack pulled Merlin’s letter from his backpack. He unfolded it and pointed to the words Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go there!” he said.

“Good-bye, Grand Lady of the Lagoon!” said Annie.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



A nippy wind rustled the Frog Creek trees. Jack and Annie were wearing their jeans and jackets again. It was dawn.

Annie sighed. “I wish we’d had a little more time to visit Venice,” she said.

“I’m glad Lorenzo gave us his painting to finish,” said Jack. “That’ll be like living our trip all over again.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

“We’d better leave Morgan’s research book here,” said Jack. He pulled the book out of his backpack and put it on the floor. “And this.” He took out Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes.

“Wait,” said Annie. “Don’t you think we should take the book of rhymes with us? For safekeeping?”

Jack nodded. “We can’t use them in Frog Creek,” he said. “We’ll just keep it safe till we go on our next mission.”

“That’s what I was thinking,” said Annie. “Come on. Hurry, before Mom and Dad wake up.”

Jack put the book of rhymes back into his pack. Carrying Lorenzo’s canvas, Annie climbed down the ladder. Jack followed.

As they walked through the chilly dawn woods, Annie held up Lorenzo’s canvas. The shimmering light and waters of Venice looked just like they had in real life. “So what should we put in our painting?” she asked.

“Gondolas, of course,” said Jack, “with people in costumes.”

“Wearing black capes and bird masks,” said Annie, “and fancy dresses and wigs.”

“And we could paint the clock tower in the background,” said Jack, “with the two men striking the bell.”

“And the watchtower, too,” said Annie, “with the gold angel on top.”

“And the ruler’s palace,” said Jack.

“And the old man and Rosa walking along the canal,” said Annie, “and, of course, Lorenzo.”

“And the lion flying across the sky,” said Jack, “and Neptune’s spear rising out of the water.”

“With Neptune himself peeking out!” said Annie. “We’ll show just the top of his head and his mysterious eyes.”

“That’s a lot of stuff for one painting,” said Jack.

“We didn’t even put ourselves in yet,” said Annie.

“We’ll paint ourselves on the back of the lion,” said Jack, “wearing our clown suits and red slippers.”

“Yeah, with huge smiles on our faces,” said Annie, “like we’re thinking, Wow! Wow! Wow!”

Jack laughed.

A chilly dawn breeze swept through the bare trees. The bells of a Frog Creek church began to chime. Jack and Annie took off running for home.





More Facts About Venice


Venice has been called a “timeless city,” as well as a city “frozen in time.” This is because so much of the city and its traditions has been preserved through time.

The festival of Carnival goes back over a thousand years in Venice, but it was most popular during the 1700s.

Gondolas have glided along the waterways of Venice for over a thousand years. In the 1700s, there were about 14,000 on the canals. Today there are around 400.

Saint Mark the Apostle is the patron saint of Venice. According to legend, the saint’s corpse was stolen from its grave and brought to Venice in the ninth century. Since the traditional symbol of Saint Mark is a winged lion, that image is depicted all over the city in paintings and sculptures. In Saint Mark’s Square alone, there are no fewer than fourteen!

In Venice, there are approximately 3,000 alleys and 200 canals. Over 400 bridges connect 118 lagoon islands.

Many world-famous painters are from Venice. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo is considered the most important of the 1700s. His two sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, were also painters.

Neptune is the Roman counterpart of the sea god Poseidon from Greek mythology. Neptune’s three-pronged fish spear is called a trident. When astronomers named the planet Neptune, they chose the trident to be its symbol.





Author’s Research Note


Whenever I start work on a new Magic Tree House book, I begin the great adventure of research. I visit libraries, the Internet, bookstores, and museums. I talk to people who are knowledgeable about my subject, and if I’m able, I visit the place where the story occurs.

I chose to write a Magic Tree House story about Venice because I was eager to visit that wonderful city again. I had been to Venice a few years earlier, and when I returned home, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I especially remembered the warm summer night when I’d first stepped into Piazza San Marco, or St. Mark’s Square. I remembered the beauty and magic of the square’s architecture, the candlelit outdoor-café tables, and the sweet violin music played by musicians in tuxedos. I was dying to go back to Venice. What better excuse than to write a Magic Tree House book about the city and have a good reason to return?

On my second trip to Venice, I brought my guide book, camera, and notebook. I visited museums and bought books filled with paintings of Carnival costumes from the 1700s. I took photographs of the watchtower and the clock tower. I visited the Palazzo Ducale, or Doge’s Palace, on the Piazza San Marco and took notes on the statues of Neptune and Mars, the paintings of the winged lions on the wall of the Map Room, and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s painting Neptune Offering Venice the Gifts of the Sea, which now hangs in a palace chamber.

My most unforgettable experience in the Doge’s Palace was a visit to the historic palace jail on the ground floor. I walked down a series of narrow, damp passageways and stone stairways and over the Bridge of Sighs until I came to the empty cells. In my notebook, I sketched diagrams of barred windows and heavy wooden doors.

As I tried to leave, I became confused about how to get out of the prison. Breathless, my heart pounding, I rushed through the musty-smelling passageways and up and down the steep stairways.

Finally I found my way back out onto the beautiful, sunny square. Once I had escaped from the palace, I happily thought, “Now, when I write about Jack and Annie’s experience in the doge’s jail, I’ll really know how they would feel!”

On the morning I left Venice, I rode in a gondola and took notes on how the gondolier pushed his oar. I took notes on the pink early-morning light shimmering on the canal waters. I photographed the ancient city from offshore, trying to record its beauty and sense of timelessness. But no photographs can truly do Venice justice. No notes or diagrams can truly capture her. Venice lives best in memory, stirring the deep waters of the imagination.

Jack put his math homework aside. He opened the drawer beside his bed and pulled out a small, handmade book. For the hundredth time, he stared at the title on the cover:





10 MAGIC RHYMES FOR ANNIE AND JACK

FROM TEDDY AND KATHLEEN


For weeks, Jack had kept the book hidden in his drawer, wondering when he and Annie would be able to use its magic again. The bookߣs ten rhymes were to be used on four missions, and each rhyme could be used only once. Jack and Annie had already used two rhymes on a mission in Venice, Italy.

“Jack!” Annie rushed into Jackߣs room. Her eyes were shining. “Bring the book! Letߣs go!”

“Where?” said Jack.

“You know where! Come on!” Annie called as she ran back downstairs.

Jack quickly put Teddy and Kathleenߣs book into his backpack. He pulled on his jacket and took off down the stairs.

Annie was waiting on the front porch. “Hurry!” she cried.

“Wait! How do you know itߣs there?” Jack said.

“Because I just saw it!” Annie shouted. She hurried down the porch steps and crossed the yard.

“You saw it? Actually saw it?” yelled Jack as he followed Annie through the chilly afternoon air.

“Yes! Yes!” Annie yelled.

“When?” shouted Jack.

“Just now!” said Annie. “I was walking home from the library and I had this feeling—so I went and looked! Itߣs waiting for us!”

Jack and Annie raced into the Frog Creek woods. They ran between the budding trees, over the fresh green moss of early spring, until they came to the tallest oak.

“See?” said Annie.

“Yes,” breathed Jack. He stared up at the magic tree house. Its rope ladder dangled above the mossy ground. Annie started climbing up. Jack followed. When they got inside, Jack pulled off his backpack.

“Look, a book and a letter!” Annie said. She picked up a folded letter from the floor, and Jack picked up a book with a gold cover.

“Baghdad,” Jack said. He showed the book to Annie. Its title was:





THE GOLDEN AGE OF BAGHDAD


“A golden age?” said Annie. “That sounds cool. Letߣs go!”



“Wait, we should read our letter first,” said Jack.

“Right,” said Annie. She unfolded the paper. “Merlinߣs handwriting,” she said. She read aloud:

Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,

Your mission is to journey to Baghdad of long

ago and help the caliph spread wisdom to

the world. To succeed, you must be humble

and use your magic wisely. Follow these—



“Wait, whatߣs a caliph?” said Jack. “And whatߣs Merlin mean—‘spread wisdom to the world’? Thatߣs a big responsibility.”

“I donߣt know,” said Annie. “Let me finish.” She kept reading:

Follow these instructions:

Ride a ship of the desert

on a cold starry night.

Ride through the dust

and hot morning light.

Find a horse on a dome,

the one who sees all,

in the heart of the city

behind the third wall.

Beneath birds who sing

in the Room of the Tree,

greet a friend you once knew

and a new friend to be.

Remember that life

is full of surprises.

Return to the tree house

before the moon rises.

—M.



“This sounds pretty easy,” said Annie.

“No, it doesnߣt,” said Jack. “All these instructions are so mysterious. We donߣt know what any of them mean.”

“Weߣll find out when we get there,” said Annie. “But first we have to get there. Make the wish.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go to the golden age of Baghdad,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Many years ago, I journeyed overland from Greece to Nepal. On my trip, I traveled from Damascus, Syria, to Baghdad, Iraq, riding in a van through the desert. Just before sunset my traveling companion and I came upon a tea tent in the middle of nowhere. There, an old man and his great-grandson served tea to the few travelers who passed their way. The man and the boy invited us to share their dinner and camp near their tent. I’ll never forget their kindness, nor the brilliant sunset over the desert—nor the cold starry night that followed. It has been a joy to return to these memories while writing Season of the Sandstorms, and I hope I can revisit the country of Iraq someday.

To Paul Caringella,

a scholar in the

House of Wisdom



Away, for we are ready to a man!

Our camels sniff the evening and are glad.

Lead on, O Master of the Caravan:

Lead on the Merchant-Princes of Baghdad.

—James Elroy Flecker





One summer day, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie were told they must travel to real times and real places in history and prove to Merlin that they could use magic wisely. They have just returned from a successful mission in the city of Venice over 250 years ago, and now they are waiting to hear from Merlin again….

in the heart of the city

behind the third wall.

Beneath birds who sing

in the Room of the Tree,

greet a friend you once knew

and a new friend to be.

Remember that life

is full of surprises.

Return to the tree house

before the moon rises.

—M.



“This sounds pretty easy,” said Annie.

“No, it doesn’t,” said Jack. “All these instructions are so mysterious. We don’t know what any of them mean.”

“We’ll find out when we get there,” said Annie. “But first we have to get there. Make the wish.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go to the golden age of Baghdad,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Nowhere

Jack felt hot. He opened his eyes. Burning sunlight was flooding into the tree house. He and Annie were wearing long robes tied with cords. They wore white head cloths and pointy slip-on shoes. Jack’s backpack had turned into a leather shoulder bag.



“We look like characters in that book Aunt Mary gave us,” said Annie, “Tales from the Arabian Nights.”

“Yeah, like Aladdin and Ali Baba,” said Jack.

Shading their eyes from the bright sunlight, Jack and Annie squinted out the window. They had landed in the spiky crown of a palm tree. It was the tallest tree in a clump of palm trees. Thorny shrubs and sparse green grass grew under the trees. A small spring bubbled up from the ground. Surrounding the clump of trees were miles and miles of scorching sand.

“This doesn’t look like a golden age to me,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and where’s Baghdad?” asked Jack. He picked up their research book and opened it to the first page. He read aloud:

From 762 AD to 1258 AD, the Arab world had a golden age. During that time, a ruler known as a caliph (say KAY-liff) governed an empire that stretched for thousands of miles. The capital of the Arab empire was the city of Baghdad, an important center for learning and trade.



Jack looked up. “So the caliph is a ruler,” he said, “and he probably lived in Baghdad.”

“Yeah, but how do we get there?” asked Annie.

“Patience,” said Jack. “Remember on our last mission, we learned that we have to do things in order, one thing at a time.” He read the first part of Merlin’s instructions.

Ride a ship of the desert

on a cold starry night.

Ride through the dust

and hot morning light.



“I wonder what a ‘ship of the desert’ is,” said Jack, looking up.

“Well, whatever it is, I’m sure we’ll find it eventually,” Annie said slowly, as if she were trying to sound patient. “We could just sit here and keep an eye out for a big boat. Or …”

“Or what?” said Jack.

“Maybe we could use one of Teddy and Kathleen’s magic rhymes.”

“Not yet,” said Jack. “Merlin said to use our magic wisely. We just got here. We used two rhymes on our last mission. And we only have eight left to divide between three—”

“Okay, okay—” Annie broke in. “We can only use a rhyme when there’s absolutely nothing else to do, right?”

“Right,” said Jack.

“So …,” said Annie. “What do you think we should do?”

“We could start walking,” said Jack.

“Walk where?” said Annie. “Which way is Baghdad?”

Jack looked out the window. Beyond the palm trees there was nothing but sand and sky. In the distance were lonely dunes. The desert was eerily silent.

“We could, uh …” Jack couldn’t think of anything else they could do. “We could look in the rhyme book,” he said. Jack pulled the book of magic rhymes out of his pack. He and Annie read down the table of contents together.

“Make a Stone Come Alive,” read Annie. “We did that on our last mission. We can’t do that again.”

“It wouldn’t help, anyway,” said Jack. He looked at other rhymes. “Bend Iron,” he read.“We’ve already done that, too.”

“Turn into Ducks,” read Annie. She looked at Jack.

“No,” he said.

“Mend What Cannot Be Mended,” read Annie.

“Nothing needs mending,” said Jack.

“How about this one?” said Annie. “Make Helpers Appear out of Nowhere.”

“Well …,” said Jack. “Maybe …”

“Come on, it’s perfect,” said Annie. “That’s where we are—nowhere. And we could sure use some helpers.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “I’ll read the line Teddy wrote. You read Kathleen’s line in her selkie language.”

“Okay,” said Annie. She turned to the page with the rhyme. She held the book out to Jack.

Jack read in a loud, clear voice:

From far beyond, send helpers here!

Then Annie read:

Hah-ee-by, hah-ee-keer!

The second that Annie finished the rhyme, wind gusted in from the desert, blowing a cloud of sand through the window. The wind shook the palm trees. Sand blew into Annie’s eyes. “Oww!” she said.

“Get back!” cried Jack.

Jack and Annie jumped away from the window. They pressed themselves against the wall and covered their faces. Gritty sand kept blowing into the tree house.

“It’s a sandstorm!” said Jack.

The hot sand piled into drifts all over the floor. Then the wind died down as quickly as it had started. The palm trees stopped shaking.

Jack and Annie looked out the window. The air was thick with grainy dust, making it hard to see. But the sand was still.

“I think it’s over,” said Annie.

“I hope so,” said Jack. “Why did our magic rhyme cause a sandstorm instead of sending us helpers?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “Maybe we said it wrong.”

Jack brushed the sand off their research book and looked up sandstorms in the index. He found the right page and read:

The season of the sandstorms begins in the desert in mid-February and continues all spring. Winds can blow as fast as 40 miles per hour. Sandstorms can easily cause travelers to lose their way in the desert.



“I don’t understand,” said Jack. “We don’t need to lose our way. We need to find our way.”

Just then the sound of bells came from outside.

Jack and Annie looked out the window. Through the haze, they saw four riders perched high on the humps of camels. The riders wore brightly colored robes. Behind them a dozen more camels were tied head to tail and loaded down with saddlebags. As the camels swung from side to side, bells tinkled from around their necks.

Annie grinned. “Helpers!” she said.



3. Mamoon

Annie stuck her head out the tree house window. “Hey!” she called.

“Shhhh!” said Jack, pulling her back in. “Don’t let them see us up here! It’s too hard to explain the tree house. Let’s go down.”

“Good point,” said Annie. She handed Merlin’s letter to Jack and started down the rope ladder. Jack grabbed his shoulder bag. He put the letter inside, then added their research book and rhyme book. He slung the leather bag across his chest and climbed down.

When he stepped onto the ground, Jack twisted the rope ladder behind the tree trunk so it wouldn’t be noticed. “Okay,” he said to Annie.

“Hey!” Annie called again, waving. She and Jack stepped out into the open.

The camel riders headed toward the palm trees. The man in the lead made his camel kneel. As he climbed off, Jack and Annie ran over to him. The man wore a long white robe. He had a black beard and stern, dark eyes. “Who are you?” he asked, unsmiling. “From where do you come?”

“I am Annie, and this is my brother, Jack,” said Annie. “Our home is far away in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

“I have not heard of such a place,” the man said. “How do you come to be here in the desert alone?”

“Uh …” Jack didn’t know what to say.

“We were riding with our family,” Annie said. “We stopped to rest here. My brother and I took a nap behind these trees. When we woke up, everyone was gone. They left us by mistake. See, we have a really big family. There are many brothers and sisters—”

“Annie,” said Jack. She was saying too much, he thought.



The man looked concerned. “Why have they not come back for you?” he said, gazing out at the desert. “I hope they have not been attacked by bandits.”

“Are there bandits around here?” asked Annie.

“There are many bandits prowling the desert,” said the man.

Jack looked anxiously around at the vast sandy plain.

“That is why one must always travel with others,” said the man. “But I hope your family is safe and will return for you soon.”

“Excuse me,” Annie said politely. “But who are you? How did you happen to come here?”

“I am a merchant,” the man said. “My caravan was traveling from the west, when we were surprised by a sudden sandstorm. It seemed to come from nowhere. But luckily it brought us to this oasis. We will rest and water our animals until the sun goes down. In the cool of the night, we will travel on to Baghdad.”

The caravan leader walked over to his men and spoke to them. They dismounted and started taking saddlebags off the camels.

Annie turned to Jack. “See, our rhyme worked!” she whispered. “The sandstorm was magic! It brought them here on their way to Baghdad!”

“But how can we get them to help us?” said Jack.

“Well, Merlin said we should be humble, so let’s offer to help them,” said Annie. She walked over to the caravan leader. He was filling a canvas bucket with water from a small spring.

“Excuse me,” said Annie, “we wondered if we could help you.”

The man gave her a quick smile. “Thank you, yes,” he said. “If you could gather dates, it would be most appreciated. My men are very hungry.” He handed Annie two large baskets.

“No problem,” said Annie. “We’ll gather dates.”

Annie carried the baskets to Jack. “Do you know what a date is?” she whispered. “We’re supposed to gather some.”

“I’ll look it up,” said Jack. With his back to the camel riders, he pulled their research book out of his bag and looked up dates. He read:

Dates are known as the fruit of the desert. They hang in bunches from date palms. People gather dates by shaking the trunk of the tree. Not only are dates an important food, but the wood and leaves of the date palm are used to make—



“Okay, got it,” interrupted Annie, putting the baskets down. “Let’s start shaking the trees!”

Jack put the book away and looked around. For the first time, he noticed bunches of brown fruit hanging from the trees. He grabbed hold of the nearest tree trunk. Annie grabbed the trunk from the other side. Together they shook the tree until dates began falling to the ground.

In the desert heat, Jack and Annie went from tree to tree, shaking each one and gathering the dates that fell to the ground. By the time they had filled their baskets, the trees were casting long shadows over the oasis.



Tired and sweaty, Jack and Annie carried their heavy baskets back to the caravan leader. He was boiling water over a fire of twigs. “Ah, very good,” he said. “Thank you, Jack and Annie.”

“You’re welcome,” said Annie. “What else can we do for you?”

“You should rest from the heat now,” said the man. “Would you like to sit and have tea with us?”

“Sure,” said Annie. “By the way, what’s your name?”

“My name is very long,” the man said with a smile. “You may call me Mamoon.”

While their camels grazed, Mamoon and his men sat on a woolen rug spread over the grass. They shared dates and tea with Jack and Annie. The dark, plump fruit was sweet and chewy. The tea was strong but good.

In the fiery red glow of the setting sun, Jack watched the grazing camels. He thought the humped animals looked really funny. They had knobby knees, big clumsy feet, and little ears that twitched. Some camels smacked their droopy lips as they drank water. Others gobbled down whole branches of thornbushes without chewing.

“Don’t the thorns hurt the camels’ throats?” Jack asked Mamoon.

“No,” said the caravan leader. “Their mouths are very tough. They can eat anything: sticks, bones—”

“Even our tents and saddlebags if we let them!” said a young camel rider.

Annie and Jack laughed. “What’s in your saddlebags?” Annie asked.

“Our bags are filled with goods from Greece, Turkey, and Syria,” said Mamoon. “We have many things: jewels, beads, and precious spices, such as cinnamon, pepper, and vanilla. We are taking everything to Baghdad to sell.”

“We have to get to Baghdad, too,” said Annie.

“We have to meet with the caliph.”

The camel riders chuckled as if they thought Annie was making a joke.

Only Mamoon did not laugh. “Your family is to meet with the caliph?” he said.

“No,” said Annie. “Just Jack and me. We have to help him spread wisdom to the world.”

“Annie,” warned Jack.

The camel riders laughed loudly.

“What’s so funny?” Annie asked.

“The caliph does not meet with children,” said a young man. “He is the most powerful and important person in the world.”

“Oh,” said Annie, frowning.

The news worried Jack, too.

Mamoon looked at Annie and Jack with a curious expression. “Night will soon be upon us. Since your family has not yet returned, would you like to travel with us to Baghdad?” he said. “You have journeyed by camel this far. I trust you can ride camels the rest of the way.”

“Sure we can!” said Annie. “We love camels!”

We do? thought Jack.

“Good. We love our ships of the desert, too,” said Mamoon. “We will set sail on them soon.”

“So that’s what ‘ships of the desert’ are!” Annie whispered to Jack.

Camels, thought Jack. Oh, brother.


4. Ships of the Desert


The camel riders all silently watched the sun set over the faraway dunes. As the fiery ball slipped beneath the horizon, the desert was flooded with red light. As soon as the sun disappeared, the air grew much cooler.

Mamoon stood up. “It is time to go,” he said.

The camel riders put out their small fire. In the growing darkness, Mamoon helped them saddle up their animals and load them with baggage.

Then Mamoon came over to Jack and Annie. “You can ride those two sisters,” he said, pointing to two camels kneeling in the sand. “Climb on, then come to the front of the line to ride with me.”

Jack and Annie walked over to the two camel sisters. Each had reins hanging from her neck. Saddles made from colorful cushions were piled high on their humps.

Annie patted the wiry, tan-colored fur of one of the camels. The camel looked at Annie with big eyes and fluttered her thick eyelashes. “Hey, Cutie,” said Annie.

The other camel nuzzled Annie’s neck. “Hey, Beauty,” Annie said to the other. “You want some attention, too?”

“Cutie and Beauty?” said Jack. He didn’t find either camel particularly cute or beautiful.

Annie climbed onto Cutie’s saddle cushion and picked up the reins. “Let’s ride!” she said.

Cutie rose awkwardly up from a kneeling position to a full stand. “Oh, wow!” said Annie, towering over Jack. “She’s really tall.”

Jack started to climb onto Beauty. But the camel caught an end of his head cloth and began chewing it.

“Stop that!” said Jack, pulling the cloth away from her. Beauty opened her mouth wide and flashed rows of sharp teeth. Jack drew back.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie.

“Easy for you to say,” said Jack. “Yours likes you.”

“Don’t worry, Beauty likes you, too,” said Annie. “I can tell.” Annie’s camel began ambling toward the other camels waiting to head off into the desert. “Come on, Jack! It’s really fun once you’re moving!” she called.

“Fun,” muttered Jack. “Right.” He held on to the ends of his head cloth and put his leg over Beauty’s hump. The camel eyed him suspiciously. She swished her tail, slapping his back.

“Hey!” said Jack.

Jack tried to get comfortable on the saddle cushion. But Beauty spat at him and made a weird screeching sound.

“Quiet!” said Jack. He hooked his shoulder bag onto a saddle horn. When he was finally settled, Beauty turned her head and started chewing on his leather bag.

“No! Don’t!” yelled Jack. He tried pulling the bag away, but Beauty played tug-of-war. “Come on, let go,” Jack said. “Give it back, stupid!”

“Do you really think she is stupid?”

Jack jumped. Mamoon had ridden up behind him and was watching as he tried to get his bag back from Beauty.

Jack was embarrassed. “Um, she won’t let go of my stuff,” he said.

Mamoon grabbed the strap of Jack’s bag. He clucked his tongue, and the camel let go. She groaned as Mamoon hooked the leather bag back onto the saddle horn.

“For thousands of years, camels like this one have carried people across the desert,” said Mamoon. “She is truly a miracle of nature.”

Some miracle, thought Jack.

“She can drink two barrels of water in ten minutes,” said Mamoon, “and then go for a week without drinking again. She can live many days without food, too.”

“Really?” said Jack.

“She is well suited to travel in the desert,” said Mamoon. “Her thick eyebrows protect her eyes from the glare of the sun. Her long eyelashes and the fur around her ears keep out the windblown sand.”

“Cool,” said Jack softly.

“Her feet are so tough, they do not feel the heat of the desert,” said Mamoon. “And they are so big that they keep her from sinking down into the loose sand.”

“Hmm,” said Jack.

“She can carry five hundred pounds of baggage on her back,” said Mamoon, “and travel one hundred miles in a single day.”

“That’s a lot,” murmured Jack.

Mamoon tugged on the camel’s reins and clucked his tongue. Beauty breathed heavily as she rose up on her long, powerful legs to her full height.

Mamoon looked at Jack. “We must respect her and honor her,” he said. “In many ways, she is superior to us, no?”

Jack nodded. He thought of the words of Merlin’s letter. To succeed in your mission, you must be humble. He patted the camel. “Good girl, Beauty.”

Mamoon clucked his tongue again to coax the camel forward. Perched high on his saddle, Jack rocked from side to side. He did not feel at all safe, but he stayed calm. Beauty ambled over to Cutie. The two sisters stood together and snorted.

The desert sky was bright with stars. Mamoon called to his men, and the caravan started moving forward.

The camels walked with a swaying motion. They moved two big feet on one side, then two big feet on the other. Jack gripped the horn of his saddle as his “ship of the desert” rocked from left to right.



“Isn’t this fun?” said Annie, rocking alongside him.

“Sort of,” said Jack, shivering. Actually, he wasn’t having any fun at all. He felt seasick and was freezing in the night air. Also, he was worried about their mission. Would the caliph meet with them? If he did, how could they help him “spread wisdom to the world”? And if Baghdad was very far away, how would they ever find their way back to the tree house?

Mamoon slowed his camel until he was riding between Jack and Annie. “When I was a boy, I spent many cold nights in the desert riding with my father on journeys to the west,” he said. “At first, I, too, thought camels were foolish. I always longed for more blankets and for a smoother ride. I wished to be back in Baghdad in my own warm bed.”

Jack smiled. He liked the caravan leader.

“But over time, I have come to love the cold desert nights,” said Mamoon. “Now when I am sleeping in my warm bed in Baghdad, I long to be here instead. I wish to be reading the wind and the stars.”

“How do you read the stars?” asked Annie.

“They have their own language,” said Mamoon. “At this moment, we are heading east, toward the Goat Star.” He pointed at the sky.

Jack couldn’t tell which star was the Goat Star. But he was filled with wonder. Thousands of tiny lights twinkled in the black dome of night. There were more stars than Jack had ever imagined. Some looked close enough to touch.

Mamoon started singing a song. The other camel riders joined in. Jack couldn’t understand the words, but the tune was soothing. The camels seemed to sway to the music.

Jack stopped worrying about how they would get back to the tree house. And he found he was actually enjoying the fresh desert air. He started to relax.

“Jack,” Annie said softly. “Guess what—we just solved the first mystery in Merlin’s letter: Ride a ship of the desert on a cold starry night.”

“Yeah,” said Jack happily. “And it’s really fun.”

Suddenly a fierce shout came from the distance. Jack sat up straighter. His heart thumped.

“Bandits!” one of the camel drivers shouted.



5. Bandits!

Jack looked around wildly. Dark figures on horses were galloping across the sand toward them. They were yelling and shouting.

“Oh, no!” cried Jack. “What should we do?”

“We will fight them off!” said Mamoon. “You and Annie take this box and ride to the dunes!” Mamoon pulled a flat wooden box out of one of his saddlebags. He thrust the box into Jack’s hands. “Hurry! Ride as fast as you can! Protect it with your lives!”

Jack frantically tried to stuff the box into his shoulder bag. But Mamoon slapped the back of Jack’s camel, and she bolted forward. The reins slipped from Jack’s hands. He grabbed the saddle horn with one hand and clutched the wooden box to his chest with the other. He held on for his life as Beauty galloped across the dark desert.

Annie’s camel ran beside Jack’s. Like two racehorses, Beauty and Cutie thundered across the sand toward the distant dunes. Rocking crazily from side to side, Jack clung to the box. “Slow down!” he yelled. “Please!”

It was no use. Beauty ran like the wind. She and her sister practically flew over the desert under the starry sky. Jack wanted the camels to stop. But at the same time, he wanted to get far away from the bandits.

Finally the camels began to slow their pace. Jack looked back. He couldn’t see the caravan at all, and no one seemed to be following them.

When the two camels reached the dunes, they began plodding around the steep hills. Once they were nestled safely between tall sand drifts, they stopped to rest. Beauty grunted. Cutie snorted.

“Thanks … thanks, girls,” said Annie, panting.

“I hope Mamoon and the others are safe from the bandits,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie. “What’s in the box he gave us?”

Jack held up the flat wooden box. “I don’t know,” he said. “But Mamoon said we should protect it with our lives.”

“Maybe it’s a precious spice,” said Annie.

“I hope it’s more than that,” said Jack. “I’d hate to risk my life for cinnamon or pepper.”

“Should we look?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Mamoon might not want us to.”

“But don’t you think we could protect it better if we knew what it was?” said Annie.

“Maybe …,” said Jack. He could see Annie’s point. “Okay.”

Jack tried to open the lid of the box, but he couldn’t. In the dark, his finger pressed against a keyhole. “Forget it,” he said. “It’s locked.”

“Shh! Listen!” said Annie.

Jack listened. He heard a high-pitched moaning sound. It sounded like music from a violin. Wafting through the dry sand dunes, the haunting music grew louder.

“What is that?” said Jack.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “Now I hear something else.”

Jack held his breath. He heard hooves galloping over the desert. “The bandits!” he said.

“We have to hide the box!” said Annie.

“Where?” said Jack.

“In the sand!” said Annie. She clucked her tongue, and Cutie knelt down to the ground. Beauty knelt, too. Jack and Annie jumped off their saddle cushions and started digging in the sand.



The sound of hoofbeats grew louder and louder. Jack and Annie dug frantically. They threw sand behind them like puppies digging in the dirt.

“That’s deep enough!” said Jack. He placed the box in the hole they had dug. Then he and Annie pushed piles of sand back on top of it.

When they stood up, Annie gasped. “Look!”

A dark figure on a camel was silhouetted against the starlit sky. The rider was winding his way through the dunes toward them. Jack’s heart nearly pounded out of his chest.

“Should we use a magic rhyme?” Annie asked.

“We don’t have time!” said Jack.

The rider drew closer, until he stopped in front of Jack and Annie. “You are safe, no?” he said.

“Mamoon!” said Annie.

Relief flooded through Jack. He laughed. “Yes, we’re safe!” he said. “And you’re safe, too!”

“My men fought well,” said Mamoon. “The thieves fled with only a few bags of pepper and painted beads.”

“And we kept your box safe, too!” said Annie proudly. She knelt and dug in the sand until she uncovered the wooden box. She handed it to Mamoon.

“Ahh, very good,” the caravan leader said.

“What’s in the box?” asked Annie.

“A priceless treasure,” said Mamoon. “I have brought it all the way from Greece. And I am taking it to Baghdad. Thank you both for guarding it with your lives. You are very special.”

“Sure, no problem,” said Jack. He still wondered what was in the box. Gold? Silver? Precious jewels?

But Mamoon did not say. He put the box back into his camel’s saddlebag. “Let us be on our way now,” he said.

Jack climbed on top of his kneeling camel. He clucked his tongue. He was surprised and pleased when Beauty rose up on her tall legs.

“We will catch up with the others in Baghdad,” said Mamoon. “If all goes well, we will arrive in the city in the afternoon. We must head east toward the morning sun.”

Mamoon rode out of the dunes. Jack and Annie followed him. As their camels rocked through the chilly dawn, daylight shimmered over the sand.

“Mamoon, last night we heard strange sounds in the dunes,” said Annie. “Like music playing.”

“Ah, yes,” said Mamoon, “the whistling sands.”

“What are the whistling sands?” asked Jack.

“Some say it is magic,” said Mamoon. “But I believe that all things in nature have their reasons. That is why I like the study of science. Science says we must observe our world. We must make experiments and try to find out why things happen. We have learned the whistling is made by sands settling in the drifts.”

“Oh,” said Annie. “I’d hoped it was magic.”

“Learning the reasons for things is magic,” said Mamoon. “True knowledge brings light to the world. And that is a magical thing, no?”

“Yes,” said Jack.

Annie nodded thoughtfully. “I guess, when you put it that way,” she said.

Swaying from side to side on their camels, the three riders traveled toward the dawn. As the sun rose higher in the sky, the desert grew blazing hot. A dry wind whipped through the air, making snaky patterns in the sand.

Mamoon halted his camel. He looked around and frowned.

“What’s wrong?” said Jack. “Are there signs of bandits?”

Mamoon shook his head. “No, it is the desert itself that worries me now,” he said. “It is restless.” He clucked his tongue, and his camel began walking again.

As they rode over the restless desert, the wind picked up loose sand and tossed it into the air. Jack and Annie lowered their heads to keep the sand from blowing into their eyes. Their head cloths flapped in the wind. More and more sand started blowing. The desert seemed alive as the sand shifted and swirled.

Mamoon stopped again and looked about. The snaky patterns in the sand were blowing into round, curly patterns. Jack heard a weird moaning sound. “Is that the whistling sands again?” he asked hopefully.

“No,” said Mamoon. “That is the cry of a terrible sandstorm. And it will soon be upon us.”



6. Sandblasted

In the distance, a haze of sand was spreading over the desert. As the wind picked up, the sky turned red and the haze thickened into a brown cloud. The cloud began gliding toward Jack, Annie, and Mamoon like a moving wall.

“Get down! Lie on your bellies!” ordered Mamoon. “Quickly! Cover your faces with your head cloths!”

Jack clucked his tongue. Beauty knelt to the ground. Jack, Annie, and Mamoon jumped off their camels and lay down on the sand beside them.

Jack tried desperately to cover his face with his head cloth, but the raging wind kept whipping the cloth from his hands. The sky turned from red to black. The moaning sound turned into a loud rumbling.



Jack looked up and saw the wind rip the saddlebag off Mamoon’s kneeling camel! The bag hit the ground and fell open. The box bounced out and tumbled away in the driving wind.

“The treasure!” cried Jack, but his voice was drowned out by the wind. He jumped up and bolted after the box.

Jack raced across the desert as the sand battered his body. The wind tried to push him down. But Jack ran with all his might, until finally he caught up with the box and threw himself down on top of it. He grabbed the ends of his head scarf and covered his face.

The sandstorm blasted over Jack, sounding like the hoofbeats of a hundred galloping camels. Jack’s eyes burned. He felt as if he were suffocating.

Slowly the thundering softened to a low rumbling. The rumbling faded to a moaning. The wind died down. The hot desert grew still and silent.

Coughing, Jack rolled over and sat up. He had sand in his mouth, sand in his ears, and sand in his nose. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed his stinging eyes. But rubbing only made them worse.

Blinking, Jack clutched the box and looked around for the others. The air was thick with dust. He had completely lost his sense of direction.

“Jack! Jack!” He heard Annie shouting.

Jack clutched the small wooden box and stood up. His legs were so wobbly, he fell over. “Annie!” he croaked.

“Jack!” she called through the dust. “Where are you?”

“Here!” he said.

“Where?”

“Here!”

“There you are!” said Annie, stumbling out of the haze. “Are you okay?”

“I’m okay,” croaked Jack. “Are you?”

“Yes! I ran after you,” said Annie. Her voice was hoarse, too.

“I had to save the box,” said Jack. “Where’s Mamoon?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “I don’t think he saw us chase after the box.”

“Mamoon!” they shouted together. “Mamoon!”

There was no answer.

Peering through the sandy haze, Jack heard thumping sounds. He and Annie turned around. Their two camels were trotting toward them.

“Cutie!” cried Annie. “Beauty!”

Jack and Annie stumbled to their camels and grabbed their reins.

“Thank you for finding us!” said Annie.

“Yeah, thanks,” said Jack, patting Beauty.

“Mamoon!” Annie called. “Mamoon!”

“He must have gone in the wrong direction to look for us,” said Jack.

“If we don’t find him, how will we get to Baghdad? And what will we do with his treasure?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He held up the wooden box.

“Look, the top’s broken,” said Annie. She pointed to a long crack running down the lid of the box.

“I hope the treasure wasn’t hurt,” said Jack.

“Maybe we should check and see,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath. He still thought Mamoon might not want them to look inside the box. But his curiosity got the best of him. “Okay,” he said. “I guess it wouldn’t hurt to make sure it’s all right.”

Jack pried apart the two pieces of wood and lifted them off. Inside the box was a book.

“A book?” said Jack, surprised. He’d expected gold or jewels. He carefully lifted the book out of the box. It had a plain leather cover with no title on it.

“It doesn’t look like a precious treasure,” said Annie.

“Maybe the writing inside is the treasure,” said Jack.

Jack gently opened the book. Inside were pages of thick yellow paper. The pages were bound with stitching and covered with writing on both sides. The first page said:





THE WRITINGS OF ARISTOTLE


“Who is Ar-is-totle?” said Annie, sounding out the name.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I’ll look him up in our research book.” He unhooked his bag from the saddle horn. Sand covered the books inside. He pulled out their research book and brushed it off. Then he looked up Aristotle in the index. “Good. He’s here,” Jack said. He turned to the right page and read:

Aristotle (say AIR-is-TAH-tul) lived in ancient Greece over 2,300 years ago. He is known as one of the greatest philosophers of all time. The word philosopher means “lover of wisdom.” Aristotle’s works were introduced to the Western world by the Arabs in the Middle Ages.



“So Aristotle was a great lover of wisdom,” said Annie.

“I guess so,” said Jack. “But I wonder why this book is such a treasure.”

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “Doesn’t Merlin’s note tell us that we have to help the caliph of Baghdad spread wisdom to the world?”

Jack caught his breath. “Yeah,” he said. “And if this is a book of Aristotle’s writings, it must be full of wisdom…. We have to get this book to the caliph—that’s our mission for Merlin!”

“We better get going!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie pulled on the reins of their camels and clucked their tongues. Beauty and Cutie knelt in the sand, and Jack and Annie climbed on. Leaving the broken box behind, Jack carefully packed the ancient book of Aristotle’s wisdom and the research book into his bag. Then he hung the bag from his saddle horn.

“Which way?” said Annie.

“Toward the rising sun in the east,” said Jack. “That’s what Mamoon said.”

“It’s that way, then,” said Annie. She pointed toward a bright blur in the hazy sky.

Jack and Annie’s camels headed into the dusty, glaring sun. “Hey, we’re following Merlin’s second instruction now,” said Annie. “Ride through the dust and hot morning light.”

“You’re right,” said Jack.

As Jack and Annie kept traveling toward the east, the desert sands shimmered and sparkled with heat. The air cleared, but still they saw no sign of Mamoon.

Jack looked down to shield his eyes from the burning sunlight. Exhausted, he closed his eyes. As Beauty swayed gently from side to side, Jack’s head dropped forward. Suddenly he heard Annie shout, “Jack! Look!”

“What? Mamoon?” said Jack, jerking awake.

“No! Look!” said Annie.

In the distance, Jack saw sunlit towers and domes shining against the clear blue sky. “Oh, man,” he whispered. “Baghdad.”



7. Behind the Third Wall

“Let’s hurry!” said Annie.

As Beauty and Cutie walked toward Baghdad, the loose sand of the desert changed to sunbaked earth. Then the hard earth changed to scrubby grass. Goats and sheep grazed in the grass, and farms dotted the countryside.

It wasn’t long before Jack and Annie came to a red clay path. The path led to a crossroads where many travelers were coming from different directions. They were all heading toward the shining city. Jack and Annie rode alongside boys driving sheep and farmers in donkey carts. They passed women with veils over their faces, carrying pots on their shoulders.



Jack kept looking for Mamoon. But he never saw him. Moving with the crowd, Beauty and Cutie clomped across a bridge. Rowboats and barges glided along the yellowish brown river.

On the other side of the river was a huge outdoor market with a maze of tents. The market seemed to be filled with people from many countries. The sharp smell of incense filled the air. Stalls were jammed with burlap sacks, baskets, and carpets. Shoemakers sat cross-legged, stitching shoes. Potters were bent over ovens, baking earth-colored pots. Weavers sat at small looms, spinning silk brocade.

“Paper? Pearls?” a merchant shouted.

“No thanks!” said Annie.

“Pigeons, parrots?” another shouted at Jack.

“No thanks!” he said.

“I love this place!” said Annie. “What is it?”

“I’ll look it up,” said Jack. He pulled out their research book and read:

In the ninth century, traders from all over the world brought their goods to Baghdad to sell. Baghdad merchants traded paper, fine cloth, and jewelry for goods from Spain, India, Africa, China, Greece, and other lands. These goods were sold in a huge open-air market called a bazaar.



“Oh, so a bazaar is sort of like a mall,” said Jack.

“It’s a lot better than a mall!” said Annie. “Let’s get off and look around.”

“We don’t have time to shop,” said Jack. “We have to finish our mission.” He pulled out Merlin’s letter and read:

Find a horse on a dome,

the one who sees all,

in the heart of the city

behind the third wall.

“It sounds like we pass three walls and then we come to a horse,” said Jack. “We’d better keep going.”

Jack put the book and letter away. Beauty and Cutie ambled through the noisy bazaar. When they left the bazaar, they came to a curved brick wall. Running along the base of the wall was a muddy moat.

“Look—that must be the first wall!” said Annie.

“Cool,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie rode the two camels over an arched bridge that crossed the moat. They passed through a gate with double iron doors. On the other side of the wall was a busy avenue lined with buildings.

As their camels wove slowly in and out of the crowd, Jack pulled out their research book. Swaying from side to side, he read to Annie:

During its golden age, Baghdad had good hospitals. The city was also known for its excellent police system and public schools, along with its many libraries and stores and a zoo with a hundred lions.



“I’d like to visit those lions,” said Annie.

“We don’t have time now,” said Jack.

Their camels clopped down the busy avenue until they came to a green field.

“Look, there’s the second wall!” said Annie.

Bordering the field was another wall. It was curved, too, but much taller than the first. It looked like it was at least a hundred feet high. There were guards at the gate, but they didn’t seem to be checking any of the people passing through.

“Act normal,” Jack advised Annie. “Don’t attract their attention.”

Jack and Annie joined a stream of people passing through the gate. Beyond the second wall was another grand avenue. And at the end of the wide cobbled road was another green field. “Look! The third wall!” said Annie.

The third wall was even taller than the second. Again, people were passing freely through its gate.

“This part of the mission is easy!” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But we still have to find that horse on the dome, and then find the caliph and get him to meet with us.”

Beauty and Cutie ambled through the gate of the third wall, carrying Jack and Annie into the heart of Baghdad. A palace loomed before them. Its roof was a glittering green dome. At the top of the dome stood the statue of a horse.

“Yay, the horse who sees all!” said Annie. “I’ll bet the caliph lives in that palace. Let’s follow those people inside.” She pointed to a stream of people entering an arched passageway outside the palace.

Jack and Annie rode under the arch and into a beautiful garden. The warm breeze smelled of flowers. They rode down a path bordered by date palms until they came to a courtyard where boys were playing ball. Near the courtyard was a stable with camels in it.

“Looks like we’ll have to go the rest of the way on foot,” said Jack.

“Yeah, I guess Beauty and Cutie can stay there,” said Annie, pointing to the stable.

Jack and Annie rode into the stable. They clucked, and the camels knelt. As Jack reached for his shoulder bag, a ball rolled into the stable. Annie picked it up and stepped outside. Jack followed her.

“Here!” shouted a young boy with curly black hair. He was holding out his hands. Annie threw the ball to him, and the boy caught it. He grinned at Annie’s good throw. “Who are you?” he called. “Where are you from?”

Before Jack could say anything, Annie crossed to the boys. Jack hurried after her.

“I’m Annie and this is my brother, Jack,” Annie said. “We’re from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

“Why have you come to Baghdad?” the boy asked.

“We have to see the caliph,” said Annie.

The boy and his friends laughed.

“What’s so funny?” said Annie.

“Our caliph is the most powerful man in the world,” said another boy. “He does not have time to visit with children.”

“That’s what everyone keeps saying,” said Annie. “But we’re here on a very important mission. We—”

“Annie,” Jack interrupted, “come on. I left my bag back in the stable.” He waved to the boys. “See you guys later. Let’s go, Annie.”

Annie started to leave with Jack.

“When you discover that the caliph will not meet with you, come back and play with us,” called the curly-haired boy.

Annie stopped. “Don’t worry,” she called back. “He’ll meet with us! We’re special!”

“Annie, come on,” said Jack.

“Why are you special?” shouted the boy.

“For one thing, we just saved a precious treasure from bandits and from a sandstorm in the desert,” said Annie. “For another—”

“Annie!” Jack said sternly. He grabbed her arm. “Come on!” He pulled Annie away.

As they headed back into the stable, Jack shook his head. “Don’t say stuff like that,” he said.

“Why not?” said Annie.

“Because it’s bragging,” said Jack. “It makes other kids feel bad. Even if you are special, you don’t have to—”

“Oh, no!” cried Annie. She covered her mouth with her hands.

“What?” said Jack, following her shocked gaze.

Jack’s leather bag lay at Beauty’s feet. It was open. Beside it was the torn leather cover of Aristotle’s book. Wet pages hung in shreds from Beauty’s mouth as she happily chewed the precious treasure.


8. Room of the Tree


“Nooooo!” cried Jack.

Jack ran to Beauty and yanked hunks of paper from her mouth. Annie dropped to her knees and picked up the torn pieces strewn around the camel’s big feet.

“The treasure’s ruined!” moaned Annie.

Jack was stunned. “I shouldn’t have left my bag here,” he said.

“No, it’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have gone back and bragged to those kids,” wailed Annie.



“I should have acted more humble, like Merlin said.” Annie sounded like she was about to cry.

“It’s okay,” said Jack. But he knew it wasn’t. The book was destroyed. They’d failed in their mission.

“Maybe—maybe we can fix it,” said Annie.

Jack shook his head. “No, we can’t,” he said. “It’s completely destroyed. It can’t be fixed.”

Annie looked up. “What—what did you just say?” she said.

“I said it can’t be fixed,” said Jack.

A big grin crossed Annie’s face. “Right! It can’t be fixed!” she said. “Help me gather up all these pieces!”

“Why?” said Jack. Had Annie gone nuts?

“Just do it! Quick!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie rushed around the stable, gathering up all the torn pages.

“Now pile everything over here on top of the cover and give me the book,” said Annie.

“What book?” said Jack.

“The rhyme book!” said Annie.

“Oh. Oh!” said Jack. “Right!” He reached into his shoulder bag and pulled out Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes.

Jack opened the book and read down the list. “Here it is: Mend What Cannot Be Mended,” he said.

“That’s the one,” said Annie.

Jack flipped through the pages until he came to the rhyme. He held up the book so he and Annie could both see. Standing in a shaft of sunlight, Jack read in a loud, clear voice:

Heal what is broken beyond repair!

Annie read the second line:

Avi-bree-all! Fen-a-mare!



The paper bits fluttered. They began to swirl off the floor. They swirled up and around as if they were caught in a small tornado. The tornado captured all the torn pieces in its funnel and twisted them together. The papers swirled into a blur of blinding light.



Jack shielded his eyes. He heard a loud whoof! When he looked up, the bright tornado had vanished.

Lying on the floor of the stable in front of Jack and Annie was the ancient book.

Holding his breath, Jack carefully picked up the treasure. He opened the leather cover. “Oh, man,” he whispered. Aristotle’s priceless words of wisdom were neatly written on the yellow pages. There was no sign of a rip or tear anywhere.

“Thank goodness,” breathed Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“So what do we do now?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “What’s the next thing Merlin tells us to do?” He pulled out Merlin’s letter and read:

Beneath birds who sing

in the Room of the Tree,

greet a friend you once knew

and a new friend to be.



“What’s that mean?” said Jack.

Suddenly Jack heard someone behind them. He and Annie turned around. A girl was standing in the doorway of the stable. She wore a long white gown. Her hair and face were hidden by a veil.

“Hi,” said Annie. “Who are you?”

“I am a servant of the palace,” the girl whispered. “Come.”

She motioned for them to follow her.

“Let’s go,” Annie said to Jack.

“Where is she taking us?” asked Jack. “And why is she whispering?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But I feel like we should follow her.”

“Okay,” said Jack. He put the book of wisdom and the book of magic rhymes into his bag. He slung the bag over his shoulder and followed Annie and the servant girl out of the stable.

The three of them walked through the courtyard and through the palace doors. They walked down a wide candlelit hallway over a thick woven carpet.

At the end of the hallway was a tall, carved door. A boy servant stood by the door. He wore baggy trousers and a long shirt. His face was almost completely hidden by his head cloth. He did not speak or look at them.

The servant girl stood close to Jack and Annie. In her strange, whispery voice, she said, “In front of the chair, bow to the floor. Do not look up and do not speak until you are spoken to.”

“But what—” said Jack.

“Go quickly,” whispered the girl.

The boy servant pulled open the heavy door. The girl servant pushed them into the room.

“Wait,” said Jack.

But the boy servant closed the door behind them, leaving Jack and Annie alone.

“Jack, look! We’re here!” said Annie. “The Room of the Tree!”

Jack turned around. A giant tree stood in the center of the room. It had silver leaves that fluttered as if blown by the wind. Mechanical golden birds sang “Tweet-tweet!” from the silver branches.



Beneath the strange tree was an empty black chair. Jewels sparkled in its shiny wood.

“We’re in the right place,” said Annie. She quoted from Merlin’s letter:

Beneath birds who sing

in the Room of the Tree,

greet a friend you once knew

and a new friend to be.



“Another mystery solved,” Annie said.

“Not really,” said Jack. “Where are the two friends?”

“I don’t know, but we better bow in front of the chair like that servant girl told us to,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie knelt in front of the shiny black chair. They bowed their heads to the floor. Jack gripped his bag with the treasure inside.

“Remember what else she said,” Annie reminded Jack. “Don’t look up and don’t speak until we’re spoken to.”

“But there’s no one here,” said Jack. He felt foolish, bowing in front of a chair and listening to the chirping of mechanical birds. Why are we doing this? he wondered.

The door opened with a low creaking sound. Jack squeezed his eyes shut. He heard footsteps moving past them.

“How did you get into the throne room?” a deep, gruff voice asked.

“A servant brought us here,” said Annie.

“And why have you come?” asked the voice.

“We have a priceless treasure to give to the caliph of Baghdad,” said Jack, keeping his head down. “It’s a book of wisdom.”

Jack fumbled in his bag and pulled out the book. He kept his eyes tightly shut as he held the book up toward the voice.

There was a long silence.

“We hope it will help the caliph spread wisdom to the world,” said Annie.

“How did you come to be in possession of this book?” the man asked.

“We were helping a friend,” said Annie. “And we got separated in a sandstorm.”

“Ah, then I suppose you brought this book to Baghdad to gain a reward,” said the man.

“No! No, we didn’t,” said Jack. “It was our mission to give it to the caliph.”

“Surely you must be seeking some payment in exchange for this treasure,” said the man. “Would you not like precious perfumes gathered from the sweetest flowers on earth?”

“No thank you,” said Annie.

“Rubies as large as hens’ eggs?” said the man.

“No thanks,” said Jack.

“You would not accept the book’s weight in gold?” said the man.

“We don’t need a reward, really,” said Jack.

“Since he likes books so much, why don’t you just tell the caliph to use his gold and rubies to buy more of them?” said Annie.

Again, there was silence. Then the man cleared his throat. When he spoke, his voice was gentle and familiar-sounding. “Look up at me, Jack and Annie,” he said.

Jack opened his eyes. He slowly lifted his head. First he saw gleaming gold slippers … then a long white robe with gold trim … then a familiar face.

Jack gasped. He couldn’t believe his eyes. The man wasn’t a scary person at all. The man was Mamoon!



9. House of Wisdom

“Mamoon?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Mamoon. “I am very glad to see that you have safely arrived in Baghdad.”

“We’re glad you’re safe, too!” said Annie. “We were worried about you.”

“I looked everywhere for you after the sandstorm,” said Mamoon. “Finally I gave up my search and returned sadly to Baghdad. I assume you found your family?”

“Uh, sure,” said Annie, “we found them.”

“And we found your book,” said Jack. “When we couldn’t find you, we decided that we should give the book to the caliph.”

Mamoon smiled. “You still do not understand, do you?” he said.

“Understand what?” said Annie.

“I am Caliph Abdullah al-Mamoon.”

“You’re the caliph?” said Annie.

“But—how—what?” stammered Jack.

“For many years, I have wanted a book of Aristotle’s wisdom,” explained the caliph. “I heard that such a book had been found in the city of Damascus, and I made arrangements to acquire it for my library. It was most important that it arrive here safely. I have long wished to travel again through the desert as I did when I was a boy. So I disguised myself as a humble merchant and made the journey. My fellow travelers never knew my true identity.”

“Wow,” whispered Jack.

“You have shown me that you have a great respect for books and learning,” said Caliph al-Mamoon. “And you have also proven you have humble hearts. Before you join your family, I want to show you a very special place. I call it the House of Wisdom.”

“The House of Wisdom?” breathed Jack. “That sounds great.”

“It is my hope that the world will indeed find it ‘great,’” said the caliph. “Come.” He started to leave the room. Jack and Annie rose from the floor and hurried after him.

Carrying the ancient book of Aristotle, the caliph led Jack and Annie out of the Room of the Tree. His gold-trimmed robe billowed about him as he swept down the corridor. Every person he passed bowed low to the floor.

“Another mystery solved!” Annie said to Jack. She quoted from Merlin’s letter:

Greet a friend you once knew

and a new friend to be.



“Both friends are the same person!” said Annie. “Mamoon from the desert and Caliph Abdullah al-Mamoon.”

“Right,” said Jack, smiling.

The caliph led Jack and Annie out the front doors of the palace. In the courtyard stood two camels with long poles attached to their saddles. Resting on top of the poles was a small carriage decorated with gold tassels and brass bells.

Servants helped Jack, Annie, and Caliph Abdullah al-Mamoon into the strange little carriage. Bells jingled as the camels began to move slowly through the courtyard.



The caliph opened tiny shutters to let in air and sunlight. Jack looked out. Everyone bowed as the royal carriage passed by: the boys playing ball, the gardeners weeding flower beds, the women carrying pots.

Jack had lots of questions about the House of Wisdom. But now that he knew their friend Mamoon was the mighty caliph, he felt shy. Even Annie seemed to be at a loss for words as they rode past the date palms and the palace gardens.

“We are here,” said the caliph as the camels came to a stop. He helped Jack and Annie out of the carriage. Then he led them up the steps of a large brick building.

“Welcome to the House of Wisdom,” said the caliph, “a learning center for the entire world.”

“What happens here?” asked Jack.

“Come, I will show you.” The caliph escorted Jack and Annie through the front door and down a wide hallway. “We have a laboratory for discovering new medicines,” he said, “and an observatory for viewing the stars and planets. But this is my favorite room of all.”

The caliph stopped before an arched doorway. He opened the door and led Jack and Annie into a huge, silent room. “This is the library,” he said in a hushed voice. “Even I must be very quiet here.”

Late-afternoon light slanted down from high, open windows, streaming over bookshelves and colorful carpets. Men read at long tables. When the readers looked up and saw the caliph, they all started to rise.

“Please continue with your work. Do not mind us,” the caliph said softly.

The men sat down again and returned to their reading and writing.

The caliph pointed to a bearded man sitting by a window, hunched over a pile of papers. The man was writing furiously.

“That is al-Khwarizmi,” whispered the caliph. “He is a truly great mathematician. He has perfected the Indian way of writing numbers.” The caliph pointed to numbers written on a board on the wall: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. “We call these the Arabic numerals,” he said.

“Arabic numerals?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said the caliph.

Jack whispered to Annie, “We use the Arabic numerals, too. They must have come from that guy.”

The caliph pointed to another man reading by the window. “He is al-Kindi. He is perhaps the most brilliant scientist and thinker in the world,” whispered the caliph. “But he is very humble. He believes knowledge cannot belong to only one person or country. It belongs to all. The world grows wise only when wisdom is shared. I agree. And that is why I built this house.”

“I agree, too,” whispered Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“Scientists and scholars from many countries come here to read and study and share their knowledge,” whispered the caliph. “We have thousands of books. They have all been copied by hand.”



“By hand?” said Annie. “That’s a lot of writing!”

“What kind of books?” asked Jack.

“Books of history, mathematics, geography, and medicine,” said the caliph. “But we also have a very special book of fantasy and wonder.”

The caliph took a large, thick book down from a shelf. He rested it on a table and turned the pages to show Jack and Annie. The book was filled with fancy writing and beautiful illustrations. There were pictures of Aladdin and Ali Baba, magic lamps and flying carpets.

“Oh, Tales from the Arabian Nights!” said Annie. “We know those stories.”

“You do? Wonderful!” the caliph said with a smile. “It seems someone from our land has traveled to yours and shared our stories. Perhaps someone will soon bring stories from your land back to us. That is the great power of a book, no?”

“Yes,” said Annie.

“And I hope your land will hear of this book, too, someday,” said the caliph. He held up the book of Aristotle’s writings. “After I have read it, I will have it copied so I can share its wisdom with the world. Thank you for helping me.”

“Sure,” Jack said modestly. “That was our mission.”

“I fear I must now return to my duties,” said the caliph. “But please, stay in the library. Read until you must go to meet your family. And come back someday to visit me.”

“We’ll try,” said Jack.

“Good-bye, Annie. Good-bye, Jack.”

“Bye, Mamoon,” Annie said.

The mighty caliph gave them a warm smile and a deep bow. Then he left Jack and Annie in his wondrous library.



10. Before the Moon Rises

Jack and Annie looked around the big room. The scholars and scientists were all deep into their reading.

“I can’t believe Mamoon is the caliph,” whispered Jack.

“Remember that life is full of surprises,” Annie repeated from Merlin’s letter.

“Yeah, and Return to the tree house before the moon rises,” Jack finished.

“I almost forgot that part,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“Shh!” said one of the scholars and scientists.

“Sorry,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie looked up at the open window. The sky was pink. The sun would be setting soon. “We have to get back to the tree house,” Annie whispered, “before the moon rises.”

“I know,” said Jack, “but how?” He felt a moment of panic. The tree house is really far away, he thought. If we traveled on Beauty and Cutie, it would take a whole day and night to get there. And what about sandstorms? And bandits? Jack looked at Annie.

She was smiling. Magic, she mouthed.

Jack caught his breath and nodded. They both looked around to see if any of the scholars or scientists were watching. They weren’t.

Jack quietly slipped Teddy and Kathleen’s book out of his bag. He and Annie turned their backs to the others and opened the book to the table of contents.

Annie pointed to Turn into Ducks.

Jack gave her a look.

Annie pointed to Fly Through the Air.

“Yes!” said Jack.

“Shh!” said a scholar.

Jack turned to the right page. He held up the book so they both could see.

Jack said the first line of the rhyme:

Sail through the sky where you wish to go!

Annie said the second:

Sawn-ee-fore, sawn-ee-row!

“You must be quiet, or you will have to leave the library!” one of the scholars said grouchily.

“Don’t worry, we’re going,” said Annie.

A wind blew through the tall open window, fluttering the pages of the Arabian Nights book. The scholars and scientists grabbed their papers before they blew away.

The wind picked up a corner of the small carpet Jack and Annie were standing on. The carpet rippled. Jack and Annie fell forward. As they tried to stand, the carpet lifted off the floor.

“Oh!” cried all the scholars and scientists.

The carpet began floating up. It rose above the long tables. It rose above the shelves of books. Everyone jumped out of their chairs and scrambled out of the way, shouting, “Help!”— “Move!”—“Watch out!”—“Impossible!”—“What is happening?”

“Bye!” called Annie.

The carpet floated to the tall open window and glided out of the House of Wisdom.

Chilly air blew against Jack and Annie. Their head cloths flapped wildly as they clung to the end of the carpet and sailed through the sky.

“This is great!” cried Jack.

“Really great!” shouted Annie.

The carpet soared over the House of Wisdom, over the caliph riding back to his palace in his carriage, and over the camel stable.

The carpet zipped over the green dome with the horse on top. It flew over the courtyard, where the boys were still playing ball, over the third wall, and past the green field and the grand avenue.



The carpet flew over the second wall, the houses, the hospitals, and the hundred lions in the zoo. It flew over the first wall, the arched bridge, and the moat.

The carpet zoomed over the bazaar with the maze of stalls, the shoemakers, potters, and weavers. It sailed high over the road to Baghdad. Below, Jack and Annie saw the men driving donkey carts, the boys leading sheep, and the women carrying pots.

The carpet flew faster and faster and faster—

over the river, the grazing fields,

and the dunes with the whistling sands,

over the red glowing desert

toward the setting sun

and the small oasis

in the middle of nowhere.

The magic carpet slid smoothly onto the scrubby grass, near the small spring and the thorny shrubs, near the date palms and the rope ladder.

The desert looked as if it were on fire with golden red light. Jack felt giddy. “That—that was so fast!” he said. “I can’t believe we made it all the way here.”

“No kidding,” said Annie. “The magic must have helped us stay on.”

She and Jack tried to stand. They teetered and fell against each other.

“Steady,” said Annie, giggling. “You okay?”

“Perfect,” said Jack. He put his bag over his shoulder and staggered off the carpet. Then he and Annie headed over to the tallest date palm. Jack pulled the rope ladder from behind the trunk, and they climbed up.

When they got inside the tree house, Jack took out Merlin’s letter. He glanced out the window one last time.

The sun was gone. The carpet looked small and ordinary in the shadows beneath the palm tree. The desert looked vast and silent and lonely. A thin crescent moon had appeared in the sky.

“Return to the tree house before the moon rises,” said Jack.

“That was our last instruction from Merlin,” said Annie. “We’re all done.”

Jack looked down at Merlin’s letter. He pointed at the words Jack and Annie of Frog Creek. “I wish we could go home!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



The Frog Creek woods were chilly in the afternoon air. Jack and Annie were dressed in their jeans and jackets again. Jack’s shoulder bag was a backpack.

“Good trip,” Jack said simply.

Annie nodded. “Really cool,” she said.

“I guess we should get home,” said Jack. “I have lots of homework to finish.”

“Leave the research book. But don’t forget to take Teddy and Kathleen’s rhyme book for safekeeping,” said Annie.

Jack reached into his backpack. He pulled out the book on the golden age of Baghdad and placed it on the tree house floor. Then he threw his pack over his shoulder and climbed down the ladder. Annie followed. Together they walked through the early-spring woods.

“We passed Merlin’s second test,” said Annie. “We helped spread wisdom to the world…. That’s a pretty big deal.”

“Be humble,” Jack reminded her.

“Well, I guess Teddy and Kathleen’s book did the hard stuff for us,” Annie said humbly.

“I miss them,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie. “But I think they might have been with us in Baghdad.”

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“Remember that servant girl and boy who took us to the caliph?” said Annie. “They sort of came out of nowhere. And we never actually saw their faces, did we?”

“No … ”, said Jack. “You think?”

Annie shrugged. “Maybe.”

Jack smiled and took a deep breath. “Maybe,” he said softly.

“Two missions and five rhymes left,” said Annie. “I hope Merlin sends for us again soon.”

“But not too soon,” said Jack. “I need to do my homework first.”

Annie laughed. “Math with Arabic numerals?” she said.

“Right,” said Jack. “And maybe tomorrow we’ll go to the library and see if they have any books of Aristotle’s wisdom.”

“Good idea,” said Annie.

A cool spring breeze rustled the trees, and Jack and Annie hurried toward home.





More Facts About Baghdad


Baghdad is an ancient city that lies between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Long ago, this area was called Mesopotamia, which means “between the rivers.” Today this land is called Iraq, and Baghdad is its capital.

The character of Mamoon in this book was inspired by two caliphs of Baghdad in the ninth century—Harun al-Rashid and his son Abdullah al-Mamoon (often spelled al-Mamoun).

It is said that Harun al-Rashid sometimes disguised himself and went to the bazaars to listen to his people. The world of al-Rashid was the inspiration for the collection of stories known as A Thousand and One Nights or Tales from the Arabian Nights.

Abdullah al-Mamoon was the youngest son of Harun al-Rashid. He carried on his father’s work by honoring the arts and sciences. He also founded the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.

The House of Wisdom was a home to scholars from all over the Eastern world. Two important thinkers who studied there were al-Kindi, who was called “the philosopher of the Arabs,” and the mathematician al-Khwarizmi, who introduced algebra (a kind of math) to the world.

Many ancient writings were stored and translated at the House of Wisdom. Some of the most important writings included the work of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Aristotle’s teachings helped lay the foundation for modern science.

Harun al-Rashid helped start a golden age, in which Baghdad would be an important center of learning and culture for the next four hundred years. In 1258, the city was destroyed by Mongol invaders.

Jack sat on the porch, reading in the summer twilight. Crickets chirped in the Frog Creek woods. The bell of an ice cream truck jingled down the street.

Annie stepped out the front door. “Let’s go,” she said.

“Where?” said Jack.

“Mom gave us money for ice cream,” said Annie.

“Cool,” said Jack. He pulled on his backpack. Then he followed Annie down the porch steps. As they headed up the sidewalk, the smell of damp leaves and moss wafted from the woods.

Annie stopped walking. “Listen,” she said.

Jack listened. “What?” he said. “I don’t hear anything.”

“That’s the point,” said Annie. “A minute ago, the crickets were blaring away. Now everything’s super quiet.”

Jack listened again. Annie was right. All the Frog Creek woods seemed to be holding its breath.

“Do you think …?” said Jack.

“Maybe,” said Annie, grinning. “Let’s go check!”

Jack and Annie hurried across the street and into the dimly lit woods. They walked quickly between the leafy trees, until they came to the tallest oak. A rope ladder dangled from the tree-top. The magic tree house sat high in the branches, catching the last light of day.

Jack smiled. “I guess ice cream will have to wait,” he said.

“Yep,” said Annie. She grabbed the ladder and climbed up. Jack climbed up after her.

Inside the tree house, dusky light filtered through the window. Lying on the wooden floor was a folded piece of paper and a slim book with a red cover.

Annie grabbed the paper. Jack picked up the book. “This must be a research book from Morgan,” he said.

The book’s title was written in gold letters:



“Paris World’s Fair?” said Jack.

“That sounds like fun!” said Annie.

“Yeah, but I wonder why we’re going there,” said Jack.

“This should tell us,” said Annie. She unfolded the paper. “It’s Merlin’s handwriting.” She read aloud:

To Jack and Annie of Frog Creek: I have discovered that an evil sorcerer is plotting to steal the secrets of four new magicians at the Paris World’s Fair.



Your mission is to find the magicians, warn them, and learn their secrets for me. The four new magicians are:



The Magician of Sound—

his voice can be heard

for a thousand miles.

The Magician of Light—

his fires glow,

but they do not burn.

The Magician of the Invisible—

he battles deadly enemies

no one can see.

The Magician of Iron—

he bends the metals of earth

and triumphs over the wind.

Good luck,

M.



“Our mission sounds more like a fairy tale than real life,” said Jack. “An evil sorcerer. Magicians of the Invisible, Light, Sound, and Iron. They sound like they belong in a magical place like Camelot, not a real place like Paris, France.”

“But we’re going to a World’s Fair,” said Annie. “That sounds kind of magical, doesn’t it?”

“Maybe,” said Jack. “But why do such powerful magicians need our help in the first place? Why can’t they defeat the evil sorcerer with their own powers?”

“Maybe the sorcerer’s power is stronger than theirs,” said Annie.

“So maybe we can help them with Teddy and Kathleen’s rhymes,” said Jack.

Annie gasped. “Oh, no! We need the rhyme book! We have to go back home and get it!”

“Don’t worry, I have it,” said Jack. “Ever since we got back from Baghdad, I’ve been taking it with me everywhere I go—-just in case Merlin sends for us.”

“Whew,” said Annie. “Let’s take a look.”

Jack reached into his backpack. He pulled out the small book written by their two young sorcerer friends from Camelot:





10 MAGIC RHYMES FOR ANNIE AND JACK FROM TEDDY AND KATHLEEN


Jack turned to the table of contents. “Okay, we’ve used five rhymes on our last two missions,” he said. “So we have five left for the next two. We haven’t used Spin into the Air, or Make Something Disappear, or Pull a Cloud from the Sky, or Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose, or Turn into Ducks.”

“Quack! Quack!”

Jack looked up.

“Just kidding,” said Annie.

“You’d better not make jokes about these rhymes,” Jack said. “You might end up saying the wrong one at the wrong time and really get us in trouble.” He closed the rhyme book. “Ready to go?”

“Ready,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath and picked up the guide book to the 1889 Paris World’s Fair. He pointed to the title. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

For years I’ve wanted Jack and Annie to travel to one of my favorite cities in the world—Paris, France. Finally, one day, while doing some research, I came across the perfect setting for a Paris adventure: the Exposition Universelle, 1889—or, as it’s otherwise known, the Paris World’s Fair of 1889. In the years before air travel, television, and the Internet, people attended world’s fairs to learn about the food, dress, and customs of other cultures. They also saw exhibitions of the newest machines and inventions.

During the late 1800s, the world was experiencing great technological change—even greater change than our world today. Join Jack and Annie as they set out on a dangerous mission to that wondrous time…

One summer day, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

For their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie were told they must travel to real times and real places in history and prove to Merlin that they could use magic wisely. First they went on a mission to the city of Venice, and then they journeyed to the ancient city of Baghdad. Now they are waiting to hear from Merlin again….



1. Four New Magicians



Jack sat on the porch, reading in the summer twilight. Crickets chirped in the Frog Creek woods. The bell of an ice cream truck jingled down the street.

Annie stepped out the front door. “Let’s go,” she said.

“Where?” said Jack.

“Mom gave us money for ice cream,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath and picked up the guide book to the 1889 Paris World’s Fair. He pointed to the title. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. A Living Encyclopedia




Jack opened his eyes. The scent of roses floated through the warm twilight. Jack was wearing an old-fashioned cap, a rust-colored jacket, and knee-length pants. His backpack had turned into a leather satchel.

Annie was wearing a puffy white blouse and a long purple skirt with a ruffle. “Look, there’s the Eiffel Tower,” she said.

Jack looked. They had landed in a park filled with trees. Beyond the park, rising into the sky, was a tall tower with lights beaming from the top.

“That’s the Eiffel Tower, all right,” said Jack. “But where’s the World’s Fair?” He opened their guide book and found a map. “Oh, great, it looks like the fair is directly below the tower. That should make it easy to find.”



“Let’s get going,” said Annie.

“Wait, we need to go over what we have to do on our mission,” said Jack.

“It’s simple,” said Annie. “We have to find the Magician of Sound, the Magician of Light, the Magician of the Invisible, and the Magician of Iron. We have to warn them about the evil sorcerer and then learn their secrets for Merlin.”

“That doesn’t sound simple to me,” said Jack. “It sounds like a huge responsibility.”

“So we’d better start now,” said Annie. “Come on.” Annie led the way down the tree house ladder.

Jack put their World’s Fair guide into his satchel, along with their letter from Merlin and the book of rhymes from Teddy and Kathleen. Then he followed Annie down the ladder.

As Jack and Annie started across the park, a clinking sound came from Annie’s skirt pocket. She reached into the pocket and pulled out a handful of coins. “Hey, our ice cream money got changed into French coins!” she said.

“Good,” said Jack. “We might need them at the fair.”

Jack and Annie followed a gravel path that led out of the park and onto an avenue lit by gas streetlamps. Horse-drawn carriages and old-fashioned bicycles clattered over the cobblestones. They all seemed to be headed toward a crowded bridge that crossed a wide river.

Boats were gliding down the river, their lights reflecting in the water. On the far side of the river, thousands of tiny lamps twinkled along the bank. The Eiffel Tower glowed in the silver twilight.

“Paris is so beautiful,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack. “Let’s cross that bridge to the fair.” They hurried to join the people streaming across the bridge.

Jack and Annie blended in easily with the happy crowd. The kids in the crowd were all wearing clothes like theirs. Most of the men wore black top hats and black coats and pants. The women wore hats as big as flower baskets. Their long, colorful dresses puffed out in back.

There seemed to be visitors from many countries. Jack saw Chinese straw hats, Dutch caps, several Indian turbans, and a Mexican sombrero.

“This reminds me of the carnival we went to in Venice,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “Except in Venice, people were wearing costumes. Here, they’re wearing their real clothes. Remember, this is a world’s fair.”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Jack looked around. How would they recognize the four new magicians? he wondered. Would they be dressed like people from Paris? Or people from another country? Or would they look like Merlin or Morgan in flowing medieval robes? And what about the evil sorcerer?

“Looks like we buy our tickets over there,” said Annie as they reached the end of the bridge.

Jack and Annie headed for a ticket booth near an entrance gate. Above the gate, a giant banner read:





Welcome to the 1889 Paris World’s Fair


As they stood in line waiting to buy tickets, Jack pulled out their guide book. “We need to prepare for our mission,” he said. He turned to the first page and read aloud:

Welcome to the World’s Fair—a living encyclopedia with over 60,000 exhibits from all over the globe!



“Maybe some of the exhibits are magic shows,” said Annie. “And that’s where we’ll find the new magicians.”

“Maybe,” said Jack. He kept reading:

This World’s Fair is a showcase of progress! Discover the genius of man! Learn all about science and technology! See wondrous new machines and inventions!



Jack looked up. “Hmm,” he said. “It sounds like this fair is mainly about inventions and scientific stuff. I don’t see anything here about magic or magicians.”

“How many?” the ticket seller asked gruffly. They had reached the front of the line.

Annie held out a handful of French coins. “Two, please,” she said.

The ticket seller took two coins. Annie put the remaining change back into her pocket. Then she and Jack walked through the gate into the 1889 Paris World’s Fair.



3. Magic? Magicians?




“Wow,” said Jack and Annie together.

Inside the crowded fairgrounds, below the looming Eiffel Tower, a band played a lively march. Fountains shot colored water high into the sky. A small train chugged through the crowd, blowing its whistle.

People of all ages from many different countries bustled about in the twilight. Everyone seemed to be having fun, reading from guide books, strolling from one exhibit to another, or buying refreshments and souvenirs.

“We can’t see much from here,” said Annie. “It’s hard to know what’s going on.”

“What about that little train?” said Jack. “Maybe we could ride on it and get a good look at everything.”

“Great idea,” said Annie.

The train whistle blew again.

“Over there,” said Jack. He pointed to a clear space where passengers were getting off the train and other passengers were boarding.

“Hurry!” said Jack.

They raced to the train and jumped on. Annie dug into her pocket and took out some coins. She held them out to the conductor. He took a few, and Jack and Annie squeezed into seats on a wooden bench. The whistle blew, steam sputtered out of the smokestack, and the small train began to move.

“Look for anything about magic or magicians,” said Jack.

As the train slowly chugged through the World’s Fair, a tour guide’s voice blared from a megaphone: “Welcome to the World’s Fair Sightseeing Train! On your ride, you will witness the astounding history of human structures as seen nowhere else! In every age, buildings had style and beauty.”

The train chugged by cave dwellings, canvas tents, and huts made of mud.

Magic? Magicians? Jack thought as he looked at the different structures. No, no, no.

The train passed a thatched cottage, a mansion with columns, and a palace with a huge golden dome.

No, no, no, Jack thought.

“Now we will visit the many lands of the world,” said the tour guide. “First, Egypt!”

The train chugged past an outdoor café. Smells of grilled meat and rich coffee filled the air. Three women with veils over their faces danced to flute music.

No magicians there, thought Jack.

“Next we have an African village on the beautiful Serengeti Plain,” said the tour guide. They passed a cluster of huts surrounded by tall grass. People played drums and shook gourd rattles. Still no magicians, thought Jack.



“And now we visit a New Year’s festival in faraway China,” said the guide. The train chugged by Chinese acrobats and a huge dancing red dragon.

“Dragons are sort of magic, aren’t they?” said Annie, looking back.

“It’s just a couple of guys in a costume,” said Jack. “That doesn’t count.”

“On our left is a Muslim mosque,” the tour guide said. “On the right, a Buddhist temple. Here is an exquisite Japanese garden….”

“No, no, no,” murmured Jack.

The train passed by a show with dolls dressed in outfits from all around the world. It rolled by a giant brown statue of a woman. “This amazing creation is the Roman goddess Venus,” said the tour guide, “made entirely of chocolate.”

“That is amazing!” said Annie.

“It is, but it’s not magic,” said Jack.

The train rode by a globe of the world at least three stories high. The globe was turning slowly. “See the lovely mountains, deserts, rivers, and oceans of Earth,” said the tour guide.

“This fair really is a living encyclopedia!” Annie said.

“But the encyclopedia doesn’t have what we need to find,” said Jack. He sighed and started thumbing through the guide book.

“Ahh, fantastic!” a train passenger said.

“Shocking!” said another.

“Magical!” exclaimed another.

Jack looked up. “Did someone just say magical?” he asked Annie.

“False alarm,” said Annie. “They’re talking about the Eiffel Tower.”

The train came to a stop. All the passengers were gazing up. Pink lights lit the huge arches at the base of the tower.

“The Eiffel Tower was built especially for this World’s Fair,” said the tour guide. “The tower is nearly one thousand feet high, making it the tallest structure in the world today. Some of you may want to leave us here to get a closer look at Paris’s newest miracle.”

People began climbing off the train. “Maybe we should get off here, too,” said Jack. “This train isn’t much help.”

Jack and Annie jumped off the train just before its whistle blew and it started moving again.

“That’s a tall tower,” said Jack, looking up.

“Really tall,” breathed Annie.



Iron rods rose in crisscross patterns high into the sky. Large elevators clanked up through the tower’s lacy ironwork. Powerful spotlights beamed from the top of the tower, sweeping long fingers of light over the city.

“It would be fun to ride to the top in one of those elevators,” said Annie.

“I know, but we don’t have time,” said Jack. “We have to find the four new magicians before the evil sorcerer finds them.”

“I wonder if he’s here yet,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie looked around at all the people busily moving about the fairgrounds, going from one exhibit to another. Parents were holding their children’s hands and pointing to the tower. Couples were strolling arm in arm. Everyone seemed happy and excited.

No one looks like an evil sorcerer, thought Jack. No one looks like a Magician of Sound, or a Magician of Light, or a Magician of the Invisible, or a Magician of Iron, either.

Jack’s thoughts were interrupted by a young girl’s voice—“You see, Papa? It is magic!”

“Magic?” said Jack. He and Annie looked at each other.

“Over there,” said Annie. She pointed to a nearby exhibit. A little girl was laughing as her father pressed a pair of earpieces against his ears.

Jack and Annie walked closer to the exhibit. “It is positively unbelievable, Mimi!” the man said, shaking his head.

“It’s magic, isn’t it, Papa?” said the girl. “It can send a voice a thousand miles!”

Annie grabbed Jack’s arm. “Did you hear what she just said?” she whispered. “Send a voice a thousand miles—that’s what the Magician of Sound does!”

“Right!” said Jack. He and Annie looked at the sign above the exhibit. It said:

Telephone:

A New Invention by Alexander Graham Bell



“She’s talking about a telephone!” said Jack. “I guess it’s just been invented!”

“So Alexander Graham Bell must be the Magician of Sound!” said Annie.

“Oh, man, do you think Alexander Graham Bell is here in person?” said Jack.

“I’ll ask,” said Annie. She walked to a gray-haired woman helping with the exhibit. “Excuse me, but do you know where we can find Alexander Graham Bell?”

“I’m afraid he just left,” said the woman.

“Where did he go?” asked Annie.

“I do not know,” said the woman. “A strange man gave me an invitation to give to Mr. Bell. When Mr. Bell read it, he left at once. That is all I know. Excuse me.” The woman turned away to answer someone else’s question.

“Alexander Graham Bell!” Jack said to Annie. “He’s a famous inventor, not a magician!”

“The evil sorcerer must’ve heard about the telephone and thought it was magic,” said Annie.

“I wonder what that invitation said,” said Jack. “And why did that lady say the messenger was strange?”

“Let’s ask,” said Annie.

Annie tapped the gray-haired woman on the arm. “Excuse me, we have two more questions,” she said. “Do you know what was on the invitation? And why did you say the messenger was strange?”

“I do not know what the invitation said,” replied the woman, “but the man who delivered it was dressed in a long, dark cloak. He wore a hood that hid most of his face, and he spoke in a deep, whispery voice.”

Jack felt a chill go down his spine. So that’s what the evil sorcerer looks like, he thought. Just like you’d expect!

“Sounds like the sorcerer,” Annie whispered to Jack.

“I know, I know,” Jack said, looking around.

“Do you have any idea where the strange man in the cloak went?” Annie asked the woman.

“He asked for directions to the Hall of Machines,” said the woman.

“Where’s that?” asked Jack. “Is that here at the fair?”

“Yes, of course. It is the gigantic building made of glass. Can you see the roof?” The woman pointed to an arched glass rooftop looming above other fair buildings in the distance.

“I see it,” said Annie.

“Good,” said the woman. “Excuse me now. I must help some other people.”

“Sure, thanks,” said Annie. “Let’s go,” she said to Jack. She started walking quickly across the fairgrounds.

“Wait, wait, wait,” said Jack, hurrying after her.

“The messenger is the sorcerer, I just know it!” said Annie.

“Of course he is,” said Jack. “But what do we do when we find him?”

“I don’t know yet,” said Annie.

“He could be dangerous,” said Jack. “We need to make a plan.”

“We need to find him first,” said Annie, “before he gets away! Hurry!” She broke into a run and dashed toward the Hall of Machines.



4. Wizard of Menlo Park





Jack ran after Annie. He caught up to her outside the huge building made of glass. She was standing in line waiting to buy tickets.

“Listen,” Jack said breathlessly, “we … we’ve got to make a plan. What if we suddenly find the sorcerer? What do we say to him? What if he tries to use his powers against us?”

“We use a rhyme,” said Annie.

“Which rhyme?” said Jack.

“How many, children?” interrupted the ticket seller. They’d reached the front of the line.

“Two, please,” said Annie, holding out some coins. The man gave her two tickets, and Annie turned back to Jack. “Let’s go inside and see if we can find the sorcerer. Then we can figure out which rhyme.”

“Okay, but be cool,” said Jack, “so the sorcerer doesn’t notice us.”

Jack and Annie walked through the entrance of the glass building. “Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

The Hall of Machines was the size of a football stadium. It was filled with thousands of people— and thousands of machines! Motors roared, wheels spun, gears clanked.

“What kind of place is this?” asked Annie.

Jack pulled out their guide book and read aloud:

In the Hall of Machines you will see machines from all over the world, bringing alive the world of engineers and inventors. You will see how cloth is sewn by machines to make clothes! You will see an exhibit of an automobile powered by gasoline! And of course, you will see a collection of inventions by the American grand-prize winner from Menlo Park, New Jersey—



“Look at that!” Annie interrupted. She pointed to a mechanical walkway overhead. The walkway circled the entire exhibit hall. Sightseers gazed down on all the exhibits. “We can get a look at everything from up there.”

“Good,” said Jack. “Maybe we can spot the sorcerer.”

He put away the guide book and led the way up the stairs. They stepped onto the crowded moving walkway and peered down at all the people milling about the exhibit hall below.

There were lots of men dressed in black coats and top hats. There were American cowboys and bearded men in Arab robes and headcloths. But Jack didn’t see a single scary-looking guy in a hooded cloak.

As Jack and Annie moved slowly over the exhibits, the air grew hotter and the sounds in the hall grew louder. Hammers hammered, sirens blew, bells rang, whistles whistled. The voices of other sightseers swirled around Jack and Annie. “What genius!” “The Age of Machines!” “He’s the Wizard of Menlo Park!”

“Did you hear that?” Annie shouted to Jack. “Someone said something about a wizard!”

“I heard!” said Jack. “The Wizard of Menlo Park! We just read something about Menlo Park.” He pulled out their guide book and found the page he’d been reading. He read aloud:

And of course, you will see a collection of inventions by the American grand-prize winner from Menlo Park, New Jersey—Mr. Thomas Alva Edison!



“Thomas Alva Edison!” said Jack. “He’s one of the most brilliant inventors who ever lived! Where’s his exhibit?” They looked down at all the booths. Directly below them was a booth with a big sign that said EDISON.

“There! Let’s go down!” said Annie.

When the moving walkway came to a staircase, Jack and Annie jumped off and hurried down to the main floor, squeezing past people as they went.

“Okay, where is it?” said Annie, looking around.

“Follow me,” said Jack. He led her down a wide aisle until they came to the Edison exhibit. Lots of people were gathered around the booth.

Jack and Annie slipped through the crowd to get a good look. Many of Thomas Edison’s inventions were on display. One of them had a big tube and lots of switches. Above it was a sign:

Phonograph

“What’s a phonograph?” Annie asked.

“I think it’s like an old-fashioned CD player,” said Jack. “It was the first thing that played recordings of music.”

A man with earphones was listening to the phonograph. Tears ran down his wrinkled face. “It’s incredible!” he said to the woman beside him. “Now we can hear the dead sing!”

“What does he mean?” Annie asked Jack.

“I guess he means that even after people die, you’ll still be able to hear their voices on the recordings,” said Jack.

“I never thought of it like that,” said Annie.

“Shh!” someone said. People were trying to listen to a man delivering a speech to the crowd. His name tag said: HENRI.

“Yes, indeed,” Henri was saying. “Thomas Alva Edison of Menlo Park, New Jersey, U.S.A., invented the phonograph, shown to the public for the first time here at the Paris World’s Fair. Mr. Edison has invented many other things, too.” Henri moved to another display in the booth: a lightbulb with a switch. He clicked the switch, turning the bulb on and off.

“Ten years ago, after years of work and thousands of experiments, Thomas Alva Edison invented the incandescent lightbulb,” said Henri. “When electricity passes through the thread, it gets very hot. There is no oxygen in the glass bulb, however. So the fire glows, but it does not burn.”



As others moved closer to the lightbulb to get a good look, Jack turned to Annie. “His fires glow, but they do not burn!” he whispered. “Thomas Edison is the Magician of Light!”

“I know!” said Annie. She turned to Henri. “Excuse me—is Mr. Edison in Menlo Park now?” she asked.

“No, as a matter of fact, Mr. Edison was here at this exhibit just a short while ago,” said Henri.

“Do you know where he is now?” asked Jack.

“No. All I know is that he was invited to a party and he left,” said Henri.

Jack felt the hair on his neck go up. “The sorcerer,” he whispered.

“Did a strange messenger in a cloak deliver the invitation?” asked Annie.

“Why, yes,” said Henri.

“Do you know where the messenger went after he left here?” Jack asked.

“He asked for directions to the Pasteur Institute. That is all I know,” said Henri.

“The Pasteur Institute?” said Jack. “Where’s that?”

But Henri didn’t answer. Another boy had asked him a question about the lightbulb.

“Come on,” Annie said to Jack. “We’ll find it somehow!”

As Jack and Annie left the Edison exhibit, they could hear Henri repeating his speech word for word: “Ten years ago, after years of work and thousands of experiments, Thomas Alva Edison invented the incandescent lightbulb….”



5. Hellooo?





Jack and Annie pressed through the crowd of people swarming about the Hall of Machines. Finally they reached the exit and slipped back out into the warm Paris night. The fair was just as crowded outside the hall as inside. Musicians played guitars, singers sang, food sellers shouted, “Chocolate milk! Cheese! Bread! Wine!”

“We have to get to the Pasteur Institute fast!” Annie shouted to Jack.

Jack pulled out their guide book and scanned the index, looking for the Pasteur Institute. “It’s not in here,” he said. He closed the guide book. “It must not be part of the fair.”

“Maybe one of those horse-and-buggies can take us there,” said Annie. She pointed to a row of carriages along a street. There was a line of people waiting to get into them.

“Come on!” said Jack.

Annie and Jack made their way through the crowd and stood in the carriage line.

“Thomas Alva Edison and Alexander Graham Bell!” said Jack. “The sorcerer must think they’re new magicians with secret powers!”

“And now he’s invited them to some kind of party,” said Annie, “so he can steal their secrets.”

“I’ll bet he’s inviting the other two,” said Jack, “the Magician of Iron and the Magician of the Invisible.”

“I wonder if they’re inventors, too,” said Annie.

“Come on, it’s our turn,” said Jack.

They had reached the front of the carriage line. “We need to go to a place called the Pasteur Institute,” Jack called to the coachman. “Can you take us?”

“But of course,” said the man.

“Thanks!” said Annie. She and Jack climbed into the back of the open carriage. The coachman shook the reins, and his white horse clopped down the cobblestone street.

“Excuse me,” Annie said, leaning forward. “But what exactly is the Pasteur Institute?”

“It is a laboratory for finding the cures for diseases,” said the coachman.

“Oh …,” said Annie. “Interesting.” She turned back to Jack. “Why would an evil sorcerer look for magicians in a place like that?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Maybe the sorcerer got sick,” said Annie.

“I don’t think so,” said Jack. “But now we really need a plan. What if we run into him at the institute? Remember, he has magic powers.”

“But we have magic powers, too,” said Annie.

“Right,” breathed Jack. He reached into his satchel and pulled out their book:

10 MAGIC RHYMES FOR ANNIE AND JACK

FROM TEDDY AND KATHLEEN

By the light of the carriage lantern, Jack and Annie looked at the table of contents.

“Remember, we can only use a rhyme once,” Jack said to Annie. “Make a Stone Come Alive— we’ve done that. Make Helpers Appear out of Nowhere—done that. Mend What Cannot Be Mended—done that.”

“But we haven’t used Spin into the Air.” said Annie, “or Make Something Disappear, or Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose, or Pull a Cloud from the Sky, or Turn into Ducks.”

“Go back, go back,” said Jack. “Make Something Disappear. What about that?”

“Is a person a ‘something’?” asked Annie.

“Why not?” said Jack. “This one rhyme could solve our whole problem. We’ll just make the sorcerer disappear.”

“Yes,” breathed Annie.

“Okay, here’s the plan,” said Jack. “Let’s memorize the rhyme now. Then as soon as we see the sorcerer, we can say it without having to look in the book.”

“Great,” said Annie.

Jack turned to a page in the rhyme book. “I’ll memorize the line that Teddy wrote. You memorize the line in Kathleen’s language,” he said.

“Got it,” said Annie. She looked at the rhyme and started to say her line, “Thee-be-wan—”

“No, don’t!” yelped Jack, putting his hand over her mouth. “Don’t say it out loud until we need it! You might accidentally make one of us or something really important disappear!”

“Sorry,” said Annie.

“We’ll practice silently,” said Jack. “And we’ll each only learn our own line. So neither of us can say the whole rhyme at the wrong time.”

“Good plan,” said Annie.

Annie studied her line silently while Jack studied his. As Jack repeated his line in his head, the carriage rolled down a busy street. The street was filled with more carriages and many bicycles. Some of the bikes were built for two people. Couples dressed in fancy evening clothes pedaled together.

Other Parisians ate by candlelight in outdoor cafés. Waiters in white aprons carried trays high in the air. Everyone seemed relaxed and cheerful. As the carriage turned onto a quiet tree-lined street, Jack wished that he and Annie could just have fun in Paris like everyone else and not be worrying about an evil sorcerer.

“Here we are!” said the driver, interrupting Jack’s thoughts. He brought the carriage to a stop. “The Pasteur Institute.”

“This is it?” said Jack. The Pasteur Institute looked like a spooky mansion. Its huge front doors were closed. Its tall windows were dark.



“Are you sure we’ve come to the right place?” Annie asked in a small voice.

“But of course I am sure,” said the coachman. “The institute appears to be closed. Would you like me to take you somewhere else?”

“No thanks,” said Jack. “We’ll get out here.”

Annie gave the coachman a few coins. Then she and Jack climbed out of the carriage.

“Thanks,” said Annie.

The coachman flicked his reins, and the white horse trotted away down the street.

Jack and Annie stared at the dark, silent building.

“I guess we should go up and knock,” said Annie. She and Jack climbed the stone steps to the gigantic front doors.

“We’ve come to the right place,” said Jack. A gas lamp lit a small metal sign that said:

Louis Pasteur Institute

Jack knocked on the door three times.

No one answered.

Annie turned the huge handle and pushed. The door was locked.

“Maybe there’s another door somewhere,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie walked around the institute. They knocked at a back door and a side door, but no one answered.

When they got back to the front of the building, Jack heaved a sigh. “It’s no use,” he said. “We’ve come to a complete dead end.”

“We can’t give up,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. They both stood looking at the street. All was quiet, except for a few bikes rattling by.

Suddenly a whispery voice came from behind them. “Hellooo?”



6. Invisible Enemies





Jack and Annie whirled around. A dark figure was standing at a side door of the institute. The sorcerer! Jack thought. He frantically tried to remember his line of the rhyme.

“Can I help you?” the figure said. He stepped forward into the light of a gas lamp. He was an old man with stooped shoulders. His hair was white and he had a friendly smile.

“Hi! Who are you?” asked Annie.

“I am the night watchman,” the man said. “The institute is closed for the night. Have you been bitten by a dog? Have you come for the rabies treatment?”

“No, we’re fine,” said Annie.

“Is that what you do here?” asked Jack. “You treat people for rabies?”

“Yes. Not I, of course, but Dr. Pasteur. He treats other diseases as well,” said the old man. “He is the world’s foremost medical researcher.”

“Really?” said Jack. “What does he research?”

“Microbes,” said the night watchman.

“Microbes?” said Annie.

“Germs,” explained Jack.

“Yuck,” said Annie.

“Microbes are invisible to the eye,” said the old man. “Some are useful and necessary, but others can cause great harm. Dr. Pasteur battles the deadly ones with research and vaccines and new medicines.”

Annie gasped. “He battles deadly enemies no one can see!” she said. “He’s the Magician of the Invisible!”

“Yes!” said Jack.

The old man smiled. “I suppose you could say that,” he said. “Dr. Pasteur has certainly helped a lot of people.”

“We have to find him,” said Annie. “Do you know where he is now?”

“Unfortunately, you have just missed him,” said the night watchman. “Earlier, a messenger left an invitation for him.”

“A strange man in a black cloak?” said Annie.

“You know him?” said the night watchman.

“Not really,” said Jack. “But we think we know who he is. What did the invitation say?”

“I do not know,” said the old man. “But when Dr. Pasteur read it, he left immediately. He said he had to get to the Eiffel Tower by ten p.m.”

“The Eiffel Tower?” said Annie.

“By ten p.m.?” said Jack. “Do you know what time it is now?”

The old man pulled out a pocket watch. “It is about twenty-five minutes until ten.”

“Yikes, we’d better get going!” said Annie.

“Thanks for your help,” Jack said to the night watchman.

“You’re welcome,” the old man said. Then he stepped back inside the institute and closed the door.

“Hurry!” said Annie. She and Jack ran down the steps to the street.

“Dr. Louis Pasteur!” said Jack. “I’ve heard of him, too! This is crazy. None of these guys are really magicians. They’re all famous for doing great things in science and stuff!”

“I wonder who the fourth ‘magician’ is,” said Annie. “The Magician of Iron, who bends the metals of earth and triumphs over the wind. Is he a magician or a scientist or what?”

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “But we have to get to that tower fast! We have to find the magicians and learn their secrets—before the sorcerer finds them!”

Jack and Annie looked up and down the lamp-lit street. A man was pushing a cart over the cobblestones. A couple on a two-seater bicycle rode by and disappeared. Then a horse and carriage clattered up the street.

“Taxi!” yelled Jack.

But the horse and carriage kept going. There was no sign of another one. The street was empty except for Jack and Annie.

“Let’s start walking,” said Jack.

“Look,” said Annie.

The couple on the two-seater bicycle rattled back down the road. They stopped near a yellow streetlamp.

“We heard you call for help. Do you need assistance?” the man asked in a gruff voice.

Jack and Annie stepped closer to the bike. The riders were an odd-looking couple. The man was short. He wore a tall black hat and had a bushy beard and a long mustache. The woman was short, also. She wore a hat with a veil that hid most of her face.

“We need to know the quickest way to the Eiffel Tower,” said Annie. “We have to get there by ten. It’s an emergency!”

“An emergency! Oh, dear!” exclaimed the woman in a high, squeaky voice.

The man cleared his throat and spoke in his low, gruff voice. “It would take quite a long time to walk to the Eiffel Tower from here,” he said. “Perhaps you should take our bicycle.”

“Really?” said Jack.

“Of course,” said the man, “if it’s truly an emergency.”

“It’s an emergency, all right,” said Annie. “But how can we get your bike back to you?”

“Just leave it for us under the arches at the bottom of the tower,” said the man.

“We can pay you for letting us borrow it,” said Annie. She pulled coins out of her pocket and held them out to the couple. “You can have them all.”

“No, please, we are happy to help,” said the man as the couple climbed off their bicycle.

“This is really nice of you!” said Annie.

“Good luck!” the woman squeaked. Then she and the man started walking away.

“You were our good luck!” shouted Annie. “Thanks!”



“Yes, thanks a lot!” shouted Jack.

The man turned back. “You had better hurry!” he called over his shoulder. “If you want to be there by ten, you will have to spin like a whirlwind!” Then he and the woman rounded the corner and were gone.

“I love this bike!” said Annie. She climbed onto the front seat, and Jack climbed onto the one in back. “Ready?”

“Go easy till we get the hang of it,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie started pedaling. At first, the large bike was very wobbly and they almost fell over. “We have to pedal at the same speed,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie balanced themselves on the bike and tried to pedal together. The bike bumped over the cobblestones a little more smoothly.

“I think I’ve got the hang of it now!” said Annie.

“Me too!” said Jack. “It isn’t that different from riding a regular bike.”

“Which way do we go?” said Annie.

“We have to find that busy street with the cafés,” said Jack.

They rode the bike to the corner and looked right and left. “That way” said Annie. She pointed to the right, where there was a busy block with lots of gaslit restaurants and people strolling about.

“Okay go,” said Jack.

Annie turned the front handlebars, and she and Jack pedaled down the bumpy street. Annie steered them carefully around couples walking arm in arm. People at outdoor cafés waved at them as they rode by.

But the street grew more deserted as Jack and Annie kept riding. By the time they came to the end, there was no one around. They pushed back on their pedals and brought their bike to a shaky stop.

“Which way now?” said Annie.

Jack looked to the right and left. Both ways were dimly lit, with closed shops and dark houses. Jack didn’t recognize anything. “I don’t know,” he said. “I wasn’t paying attention during the carriage ride.”

“Me, either,” said Annie.

Jack could see the Eiffel Tower rising into the sky behind other buildings. It didn’t look that far away, but he had no idea how to get there. “Let’s try going left,” he said.

Jack and Annie turned left and rattled over the cobblestones until they came to an empty square at the end of the street.

“It’s a dead end,” said Jack.

“We have to go back!” said Annie. “Hurry!”

Jack and Annie turned the bike around and sped back up the street. They pedaled until they came to another dead end.

“Oh, no!” said Jack. “Where’s that busy street with all the cafés?”

“We must have missed it somehow,” said Annie. “We’re completely lost! And it’s almost ten o’clock!”

“This is so annoying!” said Jack. “The tower is right there!” He pointed to the Eiffel Tower looming over Paris. “It’s really not that far away! We just don’t know how to get there!”

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “That guy said that to get there by ten, we’d have to ‘spin like a whirlwind.’”

“I know, but we’re lost!” said Jack. “We don’t know which way to go!”

“It doesn’t matter!” said Annie. “We have to spin! Spin into the Air! That’s one of our magic rhymes! We have to spin our bike into the air!”



7. Start Pedaling!





“Wow,” whispered Jack. He reached into his satchel and pulled out their rhyme book.

“I’ll say the first line of the rhyme,” Jack said to Annie. “You say the second. Then we’ll start pedaling as fast as we can. The street’s empty. No one will see us. So we can—”

“Good,” interrupted Annie. “Let’s get going.”

Jack held up the rhyme book so they could both read by the light of a streetlamp. He read his line first:

Whirl and twirl and swirl and spin!

Then Annie read the second line:

Tee-roll-eye-bee-eye-ben!

Jack shoved the book back into his satchel. “Pedal!” he cried.

Jack and Annie balanced themselves on the bike and pedaled hard. The bike rattled over the cobblestones.

“Faster!” shouted Jack. He pedaled as hard as he could.

The bike shot forward! The front wheel began rising off the stone pavement!

“Whoa!” cried Annie.

“Hold on tight!” cried Jack.

Jack gripped his handlebars as the wheels spun faster and faster and the bicycle rose into the air. It rose higher and higher above the dark street, above the rooftops, and into the moon-bright sky.

“Turn left!” shouted Jack.

Annie turned her handlebars, and the flying bicycle headed straight toward the Eiffel Tower. The white beams of the tower’s spotlights swept over Paris, shining on chimneys, church steeples, and domes. But Jack kept his eyes fixed on the glowing iron tower. That was where they had to go. That was their goal.



As Jack and Annie pedaled, the warm Paris air embraced them, holding the bike steady. With very little effort, they drew closer and closer to the tower. Soon they were almost there.

“We have to land!” shouted Jack.

“I know!” shouted Annie. “Lean forward!”

They both leaned forward. The front wheel of the bike dipped. Annie steadied her handlebars as the bike zoomed down toward the base of the tower.

“Stop pedaling!” shouted Jack. He was afraid they would dive straight into the ground.

But the bike seemed to have a mind of its own. As it drew nearer to the base of the tower, it began to drop softly and slowly, like a falling feather.

The bike floated closer and closer to the ground. Its wheels brushed the grass of a shadowy garden not far from the tower. Jack and Annie pushed on the brakes and the bike slowed to a stop. Then it fell gently onto its side, dumping Jack and Annie onto the soft, wet grass.

Jack looked up. The Eiffel Tower loomed above them, reaching toward the bright Paris moon.

“We made it,” Annie said breathlessly.

“Not yet,” said Jack. “We still have to find that party.” He and Annie stood up.

“But first we have to leave the bike under the tower, like we promised,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie picked up the big bike. They jumped back on and started pedaling toward the Eiffel Tower. The bike felt a lot clunkier on the ground than it had in the air. As they bumped over the grass, they saw people streaming away from the fairgrounds.

“It looks like the fair’s closing,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie parked the bike in a bike stand beneath the tower. The area looked deserted. There was no sign of a party or of the new magicians. A single guard stood under one of the tall arches.

“Excuse me!” Annie called to the guard. “Do you know what time it is?”

“Almost ten,” answered the guard.

“Is the tower closed for the day?” said Jack.

“Yes, I’m afraid it is,” said the guard.

“We heard there was going to be a party at the Eiffel Tower tonight,” said Annie.

The guard shook his head. “No, sorry. As you can see, there is no party here—unless you mean the private affair at the top of the tower.”

“There’s a private party at the very top?” said Annie. She and Jack looked up. The top of the tower seemed a mile away.

“Yes, with some very important guests,” said the guard. He leaned closer and whispered, “Mr. Thomas Edison, Dr. Louis Pasteur, and Mr. Alexander Graham Bell.”

“That’s our party!” exclaimed Annie.

“Is there a fourth guest?” Jack asked.

“There may be others, but I did not see anyone else go up,” said the guard.

“We need to be there, too,” said Annie. “How do we get up?”

The guard smiled. “I am sorry,” he said, “but the elevators are all shut down for the night. Even if you had an invitation, the only way you could get to the top would be to climb the steps.” The guard looked up. “And that is quite a few steps, indeed. Come back bright and early tomorrow and you can ride the elevators.” The guard tipped his hat and strolled away.

“Excuse me, sir!” Annie called after him. “Just how many steps are there?”

“To be exact, there are 1,652 steps to the platform at the top of the Eiffel Tower,” the guard said. Then he disappeared into the dark.

“That’s too many steps,” said Jack.

“Let’s fly up on the bike!” said Annie.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “We can only use a rhyme once, remember?” He pulled out their book of rhymes and read the ones they hadn’t used. “Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose.”

“That doesn’t help,” said Annie.

“Pull a Cloud from the Sky,” read Jack.

“No help there, either,” said Annie.

“Turn into Ducks,” read Jack.

Annie smiled.

“Forget it. I’m not meeting Thomas Edison as a duck,” said Jack.

“So …?” said Annie.

“The steps,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie moved quickly around the base of the tower, searching for steps. “There!” said Jack. They hurried to a staircase tucked inside one of the legs of the tower.

Jack gripped the iron railing. “Ready?” he said.

“Yep,” said Annie. “Let’s go.”

Together they started up the 1,652 steps that led to the top platform of the Eiffel Tower.



8. Secrets




Jack could see the Paris sky through the iron rails of the tower. At first, climbing was easy. The steps weren’t very steep, and Jack counted each one as they climbed. “Twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight…”

“I wonder what’s going on at the top now,” said Annie.

“Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three,” breathed Jack.

“I wonder if the sorcerer is there with the others,” said Annie. “What will he do when he finds out those guys aren’t the kind of magicians he thinks they are?”



“Don’t know,” breathed Jack. “Forty-nine, fifty.”

“I’ll bet he won’t believe them!” said Annie. “He might kidnap them—and force them to tell their secrets.”

“Sixty-one, sixty-two …,” said Jack.

“Faster, faster,” said Annie.

By the time Jack had counted the 360 steps to the tower’s first-story platform, they were both panting. Jack’s feet felt like lead.

“That’s a lot of steps!” said Annie, out of breath.

“No … no kidding,” said Jack, gasping between words. “But we… we have to keep going!”

They kept going—but a little more slowly. Jack picked up the count: “Three hundred sixty-one … three hundred sixty-two …”

“You can see how he might have thought Alexander Graham Bell was a new magician,” said Annie, panting.

“Three hundred ninety-two … three hundred ninety-three …,” said Jack.

“Think about it!” said Annie. “You’ve never used a phone in your life … then one day you pick up this thing… hear a voice talking… the voice of someone … who lives far away … you’d think…”

“Magic!” breathed Jack. “Four hundred forty-four … four hundred forty-five …”

“And Thomas Edison!” said Annie. “Think about it! Thousands of years … you depend on fire for light… then one day… you flip a switch… presto!… a glass bulb lights up….”

“Magic!” gasped Jack. “Five hundred ten … five hundred eleven …”

“And Louis Pasteur… think about it!” said Annie. “There are all these diseases … nobody knows what’s causing them … then one day … this guy discovers germs … and he figures out a way … to wipe out the bad ones!”

“Magic!” said Jack. “Six hundred two … six hundred three … six hundred four…”

“I can’t believe the sorcerer would do anything mean to these guys!” said Annie. “Even if he is …”

“Evil…,” said Jack. “Six hundred twenty … six hundred twenty-one…” His leg muscles burned, but he moved like a machine up the mountain of steps. Finally they reached the second platform. “Seven hundred!” breathed Jack.

“We have … to keep going,” said Annie.

“Keep going… and let’s get… our rhyme ready” said Jack. “As soon as we see … the sorcerer … we have to say it… make him disappear!”

“Right,” breathed Annie. “That’s our mission! Protect… the new magicians … and find out… their secrets … for Merlin….”

“Don’t talk … save breath …,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie kept climbing and counting. Drawing closer to the top of the tower, Jack heard piano music. As they climbed higher, the music grew louder.

Finally, Jack and Annie climbed onto a third platform. “One thousand six hundred and fifty-two!” gasped Jack. They were almost at the very top of the tower. A spiral staircase led from the platform up to a terrace.

Jack’s leg muscles ached, his head hurt, his heart pounded. “But we have to keep… going…,” he whispered. He and Annie dragged themselves up the spiral staircase that led to the terrace.

They both collapsed and sat on the top step, trying to breathe. A flag overhead flapped noisily. Damp with sweat, Jack felt chilled by the wind.

The piano music was coming from a small apartment on the terrace.

“I wonder who’s … playing,” said Annie, still gasping for breath.

“Maybe one of the … magicians,” said Jack.

“Or the … the sorcerer,” said Annie.

Jack felt a surge of fear. It almost took away his tiredness. “We have to… make him disappear,” he said. He stood up shakily.

“Let’s look through the window,” said Annie.

The two of them struggled against the wind as they staggered to the window of the apartment. When they peeked in, they saw a cozy room with leather chairs and glowing lamps. A man with a trim, pointed beard was playing the piano. Behind him stood an elderly man with a graying beard, a big man with a bushy white beard, and a friendly-looking man with no beard. All of them were smiling and nodding their heads in time to the music.



“There’re four of them in there,” whispered Jack.

“Is the fourth one the sorcerer?” said Annie. “Or is he the fourth new magician?”

“I don’t think any of them are the sorcerer,” whispered Jack. “None of them look evil. They all look pretty nice.”

“What is this place, anyway?” said Annie.

“Let’s check the book,” said Jack. He pulled out the guide book and looked up Eiffel Tower. He found a drawing of the tower. Each platform was labeled. The area at the top read:





At the very top of the tower is the apartment of Gustave Eiffel.


A picture showed Gustave Eiffel sitting in his apartment.

“Look, he’s the guy playing the piano!” said Jack. He read on:

Gustave Eiffel is one of the world’s master engineers. He built the Eiffel Tower with glass and iron, the world’s newest building materials. Since these materials are lighter than stone or brick, structures can be built very tall. The tower’s open design and its iron beams keep it stable in strong winds.



“He’s the fourth magician!” whispered Jack. “The Magician of Iron—

he bends the metals of earth and triumphs over the wind!”

“They’re all together now,” said Annie. “Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Louis Pasteur, and Gustave Eiffel—the four new magicians.”

“And the evil sorcerer hasn’t shown up yet,” said Jack.

“Come on,” said Annie. “We have to warn them about him!”

“And find out their secrets before he does!” said Jack. He and Annie walked to the door of the apartment. Annie knocked.

The night fell silent as the piano music stopped.

Oh, brother, thought Jack. How would they explain such a weird situation to these famous men?

The door of the apartment opened. Gustave Eiffel looked out. “Yes?” he said.

“Hello. Can we come in?” asked Annie.

Mr. Eiffel looked startled. “Goodness, I seem to be having many unexpected guests tonight. How did you get up here, little girl? I thought the elevators were closed.”

“My brother and I climbed the stairs,” said Annie.

“Oh, my! That’s a very long climb for two children!” said Mr. Eiffel. “Or anyone else, for that matter! Did someone invite you to a party here, too?”

“Not exactly,” said Annie.

“Well, come in anyway. The more the merrier!” Mr. Eiffel stepped back to let Annie and Jack inside. Then he closed the door behind them.

The four men looked curiously at Jack and Annie.

“Before you tell us about yourselves, allow me to introduce my other unexpected guests,” said Mr. Eiffel. “This is Dr. Louis Pasteur.” He pointed to the elderly man with the graying beard. “And Mr. Alexander Graham Bell.” The big man with the white beard nodded. “And Mr. Thomas Alva Edison.”

The friendly-looking man reached out and shook both of their hands, first Annie’s, then Jack’s. “You can call me Alva,” Mr. Edison said.

“Hi, Alva,” Jack murmured shyly. He couldn’t believe he was shaking hands with Thomas Alva Edison.

“You can call us Jack and Annie,” said Annie.

“So, Jack and Annie, how did you learn about this gathering?” Mr. Eiffel asked. “You have nothing to do with the invitations these gentlemen received, do you?”

“We … um …” Annie smiled a goofy grin, as if she didn’t know what to say next. She took a deep breath. “Well, no,” she said. “But we know who sent them.”

“Who?” asked Mr. Eiffel.

“An evil sorcerer who wants to steal the secrets of your magic,” said Annie.

“An evil sorcerer?” said Mr. Eiffel.

“Yes,” said Annie. “We can make him disappear, but we need you to tell us your secrets before he gets here.”

The four men just stared at her.

“What did she say?” asked Mr. Edison, as if he were a little hard of hearing.

“She says an evil sorcerer wants to steal the secrets of our magic,” Mr. Eiffel said loudly. “And that we must tell them our secrets before the sorcerer arrives.”

Mr. Edison laughed. So did the others.

Jack felt his face grow red.

“The secrets of our magic, eh?” said Mr. Eiffel. “That’s really a very good question. Let’s think…. I believe the secret of my magic is actually quite simple. I have a taste for adventure and a love of work and responsibility. So the challenge of building the tallest structure in the world was greatly appealing to me.”

“Very good,” said Annie. “Taste for adventure, love of work and responsibility.” She turned to Dr. Pasteur. “Doctor, what’s your secret?”

“My secret?” said Dr. Pasteur. He looked down at the floor for a long moment. Then he looked up and said, “I believe my secret is this: Chance favors the prepared mind.”

The other men nodded.

“Hmm,” said Mr. Bell.

“Ah,” said Mr. Eiffel.

“Indeed,” said Mr. Edison.

“Um … what does that mean?” said Annie.

“Chance means luck,” explained Dr. Pasteur. “I daresay we all hope for a bit of luck in our work. But I find the more I study and prepare, the luckier I become.”

“Oh, that makes good sense,” said Annie. “Studying makes you luckier.” She turned to Mr. Edison. “Alva, what’s your secret?”

Mr. Edison smiled modestly. “Well, let me see.” His eyes were bright and twinkling. “I suppose my secret is this: Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.”

The other men laughed.

“That’s right,” said Mr. Eiffel. “Sweat! Hard work! Thousands of experiments fail—then finally one works!”

The other men clapped.

“I get it!” said Annie. “Genius is mostly sweat.”

Everyone then turned to the last magician.

“Oh, my,” said Mr. Bell. He stroked his bushy white beard. “How shall I say it?” He closed his eyes. “When one door closes, another door opens.”

Everyone started to applaud.

“Wait, there’s more!” Keeping his eyes closed, Mr. Bell continued. “We often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the new ones which open for us.” He looked at everyone and smiled. The other men clapped again.

“Yes, yes!” said Mr. Eiffel. “There’s always another door.”

“Never give up hope!” said Annie. “Got it!”

Mr. Eiffel smiled at Annie. “So, do you think our secrets would satisfy your evil sorcerer?”

Before Annie could answer, there was a loud knocking on the door.



9. The Sorcerer





Jack’s knees turned to jelly.

The knocking came again.

Mr. Eiffel laughed. “Goodness, another unexpected guest!” He started toward the door.

“Don’t open it!” Jack shouted.

Everyone looked at Jack as if he were crazy.

“It’s the sorcerer!” Jack said. “My sister was telling the truth! He thinks you’re all magicians!”

“Don’t be afraid, son,” Dr. Pasteur said to Jack. “I’m sure it’s just another guest.”

Mr. Eiffel stepped toward the door.

“No, please!” shouted Jack.

Mr. Eiffel opened the door. There was a deafening clap of thunder! A ball of fire blasted into the room!

Jack covered his face.

Then all was quiet.

“Jack?” Annie said in a small voice.

Jack looked up. A golden haze had filled the room. Annie stepped quickly to Jack’s side. But none of the others moved. Mr. Eiffel, Mr. Bell, Mr. Edison, and Dr. Pasteur were all as still as stone.

Jack could barely make out a dark figure in a long cloak standing in the doorway.

“It’s him!” Jack cried. “We have to say our rhyme!” Jack shouted the line he had memorized:

Thing before us, now we see—

Jack waited for Annie to finish the rhyme. But she didn’t say her line. Oh, no! She’s forgotten it! Jack thought wildly.

Suddenly he heard Annie laugh. “It’s you,” she said.



Jack looked up. The haze had cleared. The sorcerer’s face glowed in the light. It was a familiar face, craggy with electric-blue eyes.

“Merlin?” breathed Jack.

The master magician answered him with a smile.

“Merlin! Hi!” said Annie. She rushed over and hugged him.

Jack just stared at Merlin. “What happened?” he asked. “Where’s the evil sorcerer?”

“There are evil sorcerers in my world,” Merlin said in his deep voice. “But I assure you none of them were here at the World’s Fair today.”

“So you were the messenger?” said Annie. “You delivered the invitations for everyone to come to the top of the tower?”

“Yes, I was the messenger,” said Merlin. “I wanted to gather these remarkable men together so you could meet them all in the short time you had to spend in Paris.”

“But why did you tell us that we had to find them before an evil sorcerer did?” said Jack.

Merlin smiled. “Without that challenge, would you have used all your powers of thinking and courage?” he asked. “Would you have been so determined to find the ‘new magicians’ and learn their secrets?”

“Well, maybe not,” Jack said honestly.

“Problems make us focus our energy,” said Merlin. “They can help us think more sharply and act more swiftly. Never wish for all your problems to disappear. Problems can help you achieve your goals. Do you understand?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“So now, what are the secrets of these remarkable men?” asked Merlin. “I truly wish to know.”

“If you want to reach your goal, you have to love adventure and responsibility,” said Jack.

“You have to study and be prepared so luck will favor you,” said Annie.

“You have to work really hard, because genius is ninety-nine percent perspiration and only one percent inspiration,” said Jack.

“And you should never lose hope,” said Annie, “because when one door closes, another one opens, and you don’t want to miss it.”

“Wonderful!” said Merlin. “These are excellent secrets! And I believe you not only learned them on this mission, but you lived each of them as well. Do you understand?”

“I guess,” said Jack.

Annie looked at the four frozen men. “What about them, Merlin?” she said anxiously. “Will they be okay?”

“Yes, they will awaken as soon as I leave. Do not worry,” said Merlin.

“I’m sorry I almost made you disappear,” said Jack.

Merlin smiled. “That is quite all right. But now we have a little problem. One must never leave a magic rhyme hanging in the air unfinished.”

“Oh,” said Jack. “So Annie needs to finish the rhyme and make something disappear?”

“Precisely,” said Merlin. “Perhaps you could use the rhyme to speed me back to Camelot.”

“Sure,” said Annie. “But do you have to leave so soon?”

“Yes, I must be on my way,” said Merlin. “I would not want to confuse these kind gentlemen. Do not worry. I will send for you both again in the very near future. But now it is time for me to … disappear.”

Jack smiled. “Good-bye, Merlin,” he said.

Annie took a deep breath. Then she looked at Merlin and slowly said her line:

Thee-be-wan-new-ee-vee!

There was a clap of thunder and a blast of fiery light—and Merlin was gone.

Just as suddenly, the new magicians came back to life. Mr. Eiffel pointed to the open doorway as wind gusted inside. “You see, son,” he said to Jack, “it was only the wind.”

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack, pretending to be embarrassed. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t worry,” said Mr. Eiffel. “You and your sister are perfectly safe. We live in the wondrous new world of science, and not in the old world of magic and sorcerers.”

Mr. Eiffel moved toward the open doorway. “Come, let us all step outside and take a look at our new world.”

Everyone joined him on the windy terrace and looked over the railing.

“Paris is a lovely city, is it not?” Mr. Eiffel said.

Jack and Annie and the others watched the giant spotlights sweep over Paris like white comets. The lights shined down on the domes and treetops, the grand monuments and church spires, the colorful fountain waters and rippling river. The boat lights twinkled like fireflies.

“Thanks to Mr. Eiffel and his tower, we can see the entire city,” Mr. Edison shouted above the wind.

“Thanks to Mr. Edison, ten thousand gas streetlamps in Paris will soon be replaced by electric lights!” said Mr. Eiffel.

“Thanks to Dr. Pasteur’s institute, we will soon have cures for many more deadly diseases,” said Mr. Bell.

“And thanks to Mr. Bell, I’ll be able to call you all on the telephone and tell you about it!” joked Dr. Pasteur.

Everyone laughed.

“And this is just the beginning!” said Annie. “Someday people will carry tiny telephones in their pockets and talk to other people anywhere in the world.”

“Uh, Annie, we’d better be going,” said Jack. He didn’t want the others to know he and Annie were from the future.

But Annie kept talking. “And there’ll be these things called computers,” she said, “that can give you instant information about anything, anytime—”

“Annie!” said Jack.

“And get this!” she said. She pointed to the full moon overhead. “Someday people will actually walk on that moon up there!”

The men all chuckled. “You have a most delightful imagination,” said Mr. Eiffel.

“And that is a wonderful thing!” said Mr. Edison. “Without imagination, none of us would be standing here tonight.”

“Well, we’d better be getting home now,” said Jack.

“And where is your home? The moon?” teased Mr. Eiffel.

“No, it’s Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, in the United States,” said Jack.

“How will you get there?” said Mr. Bell.

“In our magic tree house,” said Annie.

The men laughed. Jack tried to laugh with them. “Ha. Good one, Annie,” he said. “Well, let’s go.”

“Annie, I hope you and your brother have a safe trip in your magic tree house,” said Mr. Eiffel. “You have both been most entertaining guests. Please come visit me anytime.”

Jack and Annie waved good-bye to the four men. Then they climbed carefully down the spiral staircase and started down the 1,652 steps of the Eiffel Tower.



10. Good Night, Magicians!




It was much easier walking down 1,652 steps than walking up. Jack and Annie walked down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down—until finally they stepped onto the ground.

Jack noticed that the two-seater bicycle was gone. “I guess those two people came and got their bike,” he said.

Jack and Annie looked around. Exhibits were covered and gates were locked. All the motion and noise of the World’s Fair had ended for the day. The living encyclopedia had gone to sleep. Suddenly Jack felt very exhausted.

“Home?” said Annie.

Jack nodded. “Frog Creek,” he said, sighing.

Jack and Annie hurried over the bridge and across the avenue. “Those guys were really nice,” said Jack as they walked through the dark, rose-scented park.

“I know,” said Annie. “They acted like regular people. But they’ve done all those amazing things.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “They’re like magicians in disguise.”

Jack and Annie came to the magic tree house. They climbed up the rope ladder and looked one last time out the window. The Eiffel Tower seemed to stand watch over Paris, its spotlights sweeping over the city.

Jack pulled Merlin’s letter out of his satchel. He opened it and pointed to the words Frog Creek. “I wish we could go—”



Before Jack could finish making the wish, he and Annie were bathed in brilliant white light. Jack looked up. One of the beams of the tower’s spotlights had come to rest on the tree house. It shined on them for a long moment.

With both hands, Annie waved wildly into the blinding light. Jack waved, too.

“Good night, magicians!” Annie shouted.

Jack laughed. Then he pointed at Merlin’s letter again and finished his wish: “… home to Frog Creek,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Jack opened his eyes. He and Annie were dressed in their regular clothes again. Dusky light filtered into the tree house. No time at all had passed in Frog Creek.

“That was a great trip,” Jack said softly.

“Really great,” said Annie.

Jack pulled the guide book to the 1889 Paris World’s Fair out of his backpack. He left it on the tree house floor along with Merlin’s letter. But he kept Teddy and Kathleen’s book of magic rhymes.

“So. We have three rhymes left for our fourth adventure,” he said.

“Quack, quack,” said Annie.

“Very funny,” said Jack. “Ready?”

“Yep,” said Annie. She climbed down the rope ladder, and Jack followed.

As they started walking through the darkening woods, the world felt familiar and ordinary again. “I can’t believe we just met all those guys,” said Jack. “I can’t believe I actually shook hands with Thomas Edison.”

“You mean with Alva,” said Annie.

“Yeah. Alva…. Wow,” Jack said softly.

“What do you think Merlin meant when he said that we had lived all their secrets, as well as learned them?” said Annie.

“Well, think about it,” said Jack. “We wouldn’t have gone on our mission in the first place if we didn’t have a love for adventure and responsibility—like Mr. Eiffel.”

“Right,” said Annie. “And we sure put a lot of sweat into our mission—when we climbed the stairs.”

“And we didn’t lose hope when the door of the institute was locked,” said Jack. “We stuck around until another door opened.”

“And you prepared us by reading from the research book,” said Annie, “so chance favored us when we heard someone call Thomas Edison ‘the Wizard of Menlo Park.’”

“And chance favored us when those two people lent us their bike,” said Jack.

“Actually, I don’t think that was chance,” Annie said.

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“Did you notice that man looked more like a kid in disguise?” said Annie. “His beard and mustache looked kind of fakey.”

“I did notice that!” said Jack. “But there was so much going on, I didn’t have time to think about it.”

“And the woman talked in that funny, squeaky voice, and the veil of her hat covered her face,” said Annie. “And the guy told us to spin like a whirlwind. That was a weird thing to say, but it reminded us of the rhyme in Teddy and Kathleen’s book.”

Jack nodded slowly. Then he smiled. “You think those two were actually Teddy and Kathleen?” he said.

“Maybe,” said Annie. “On our last three missions, I felt like they were with us, helping us get to the right place at the right time.”

“Next time, maybe we can catch them when they help us,” said Jack.

Annie laughed. “Yeah, we’ll try to surprise them for a change!”

“Good plan,” said Jack.

A bell jingled in the distance.

“Ice cream!” said Annie.

“Yep, that’s our mission now!” said Jack.

The ice cream bell jingled again. Jack and Annie ran out of the woods into the soft summer twilight.



Author’s Note




The famous words of Alexander Graham Bell have given many people hope in the face of disappointment: “When one door closes another door opens. But we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.”

Bell tried many doors as he attempted to invent a device that could transmit a human request. After countless experiments, while working on his invention one day, Bell called out to his assistant in the next room: “Mr. Watson, come here.” To their surprise, Watson heard Bell’s request over a transmitter they’d been working on. These turned out to be the first words ever heard over a telephone.

When Thomas Alva Edison gave his famous quote, “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration,” he really meant it! He was always a hard worker. As a child, Edison read nearly every book in the public library. When he was only twelve, he sold snacks on trains and had another business selling vegetables. When he was thirteen, he started his own newspaper, and at fifteen he became an expert telegraph operator.

In his spare time, Edison worked on inventions. Early on, a blow to his ear and a case of scarlet fever damaged his hearing. The silence of his deafness only helped him concentrate. Eventually Edison opened a laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. There he invented the first incandescent electric lightbulb and the first phonograph, or record player. A few years later, he created the first silent motion pictures. By the end of his career, Edison had patents for over 1,000 inventions. When he died in 1931, households all over America dimmed their electric lights to honor him.

By the time Louis Pasteur stated that “chance favors the prepared mind,” he had learned a lot about being well prepared. As a medical researcher in Paris, Pasteur studied microbes for many years. He hoped to understand how germs and infectious diseases were related. Pasteur’s hard work led to the “germ theory” in medicine. He developed a life-saving vaccine to fight rabies, and he created a process called “pasteurization” that uses heat to kill germs in food. Today the Pasteur Institute in Paris is still a very important medical research center that helps prevent and treat deadly diseases.

The French engineer Gustave Eiffel gave much credit for his success to his parents. He said, “From my father I inherited a taste for adventure, from my mother a love of work and responsibility.” Eiffel had many great adventures in his career. Using the new technology of building with iron, he designed innovative bridges and viaducts. He even helped design the Statue of Liberty for New York City. But his most amazing feat was the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the tallest structure in the world until 1930.

Eiffel faced a lot of resistance to building the tower. At first, many people thought the design was terribly ugly; others were sure the tower would topple over in strong winds. But Eiffel had designed his tower so that the wind could blow safely through its open latticework. In time it became the most beloved symbol of Paris. Today the Eiffel Tower has over 6 million visitors a year.


Thomas Alva Edison actually met with Gustave Eiffel in Eiffel’s tower office during the 1889 Paris World’s Fair. Also on his visit to Paris, Edison met with Louis Pasteur at the Pasteur Institute. The only one of the four great men not in Paris that summer was Alexander Graham Bell, but a display of his new telephone invention was one of the most popular exhibits at the World’s Fair.

The November sky was gray with clouds. Jack sat reading in front of the living room fire.

“Who wants hot chocolate?” his dad called from the kitchen.

“Me, please!” said Jack.

The front door burst open, and with a gust of cold wind, Annie rushed inside. “Jack! Guess what!” she whispered. “It’s back!”

“How do you know?” said Jack.

“I was walking home from the library”— Annie paused to catch her breath—“and I saw a flash in the sky above the woods. The last time that happened—”

Before she could finish the sentence, Jack jumped up. “Dad, Annie and I are going to go outside for a while!” he shouted. “Can the hot chocolate wait till we get back?”

“Sure, have fun!” their dad called from the kitchen.

“I have to get my pack,” Jack said to Annie. “Meet you on the porch.”

“Don’t forget the rhyme book!” said Annie.

Annie slipped outside and Jack ran up to his room. He grabbed his backpack. He checked to make sure their book of magic rhymes was inside. Good, there it was.



Jack charged back downstairs. He pulled on his boots, put on his jacket, tied a scarf around his neck, grabbed his mittens, and headed out the door.

“Come on!” said Annie.

Jack could see his breath in the cold air. “Brrr,” he said. “Let’s hurry!”

Jack and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They wove between the trees, their boots crunching through the fallen leaves.

Jack stopped. The magic tree house was back. High in a tall oak tree, it was silhouetted against the gray November sky. “You were right,” he said to Annie. “Good work.”

“Thanks,” Annie said. She ran to the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her.

When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack and Annie saw a book and a scroll of parchment paper lying on the floor. Annie picked up the scroll, unrolled it, and read aloud.

Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,

I am sending you on one more mission to

prove that you can use magic wisely. This

poem will guide you.

—M.



The very last unicorn

Is now hidden well

By those who have put him

Under a spell.



Four centuries, four decades

From that afternoon,

At the end of November,

Before the blue moon,



He will wake once more

And be free to go home

If you call out his name:

Divine Flower of Rome.



You must coax him to stand

Once his name is spoken.

His chain will break

And the spell, too, be broken.



Then a young girl must love him

And show him the way,

Lest he be trapped forever

On public display.



If he loses this chance

To rise and depart,

All magic will fade

From his horn and his heart.



“A unicorn!” breathed Annie. “I love him already. I’ll show him the way!”

“But this poem is really hard to understand,” said Jack. “What kind of research book did Morgan send us?”

He picked up the book that had been left for them by Morgan le Fay, the librarian of Camelot. The cover showed a row of skyscrapers. The title was New York City Guide Book, 1938.

“New York City?” said Annie. “I love New York City! Remember the great time we had there with Aunt Mallory?”



“Yeah, I love it, too,” said Jack. “But why would there be a unicorn in New York City in 1938? A unicorn is an ancient fantasy creature. New York City’s a real place, and 1938 is not even that long ago.”

“You’re right,” said Annie. “It sounds like a hard mission. But don’t forget we have Teddy and Kathleen’s magic rhymes to help us.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He pulled out the book given to them by their friends Teddy and Kathleen, two young enchanters of Camelot. “The problem is, we can only use each rhyme once, and we’ve already used seven out of the ten.”

“Which means we still have three left,” said Annie. “What are they?”

“Pull a Cloud from the Sky,” said Jack.

“Cool,” said Annie.

“Yeah, it is,” said Jack. “But I’m not sure it will be much use.” He looked back at the book. “Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose,” he said.

“Hey, that’s a really good one!” said Annie. “The unicorn’s a treasure. So that rhyme could take care of our whole mission.”

“But it only partly fits,” said Jack. “You could call the unicorn a treasure. But once we find him, we have to lose him. He has to go back home.”

“Oh, right…,” said Annie. “What else?”

“Your favorite,” said Jack. “Turn into Ducks.”

Annie laughed. “I can’t wait to use that one!” she said.

“I hope we never use that one,” said Jack. He didn’t want to waddle around and quack like a duck. “These leftover rhymes don’t seem very helpful to me.”

“Well, let’s just wait and see,” said Annie. “But now…” She held up Morgan’s research book and smiled.

Jack nodded. “New York City, here we come,” he said. He pointed at the book’s cover. “I wish we could go there!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

Here’s what kids have to say to

Mary Pope Osborne, author of

Finally Jack and Annie go to New York City, the place I called home for over twenty-five years. New York City is a larger-than-life place, filled with skyscrapers, taxis, subways, parks, museums, theaters, and busy, bustling streets. The city has all kinds of weather, too, from heat waves to raging snowstorms. I remember one particularly dramatic blizzard in 1996. The city came to a complete standstill as the wind howled and it snowed and snowed and snowed. When the storm finally ended, pale sunlight shone on all the white streets and sidewalks—and everyone went out to play. Kids made giant snowmen and dogs tunneled through the snowdrifts.

No matter what disasters it suffers, New York City always comes back. I hope you have a great adventure there with Jack and Annie.

To Elwood Smith, who long ago

in New York City inspired me

to write for children



He stays, the Unicorn, In captivity….

Yet look again—

His horn is free,

Rising above

Chain, fence, and tree.

One summer day, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

For their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie were told they must travel to real times and real places in history and prove to Merlin that they could use magic wisely. First they went on a mission to the city of Venice. Next they journeyed to the ancient city of Baghdad. On their most recent trip they visited the city of Paris in 1889. Now they are waiting to hear from Merlin again….



1. The Last Unicorn




The November sky was gray with clouds. Jack sat reading in front of the living room fire.

“Who wants hot chocolate?” his dad called from the kitchen.

“Me, please!” said Jack.

The front door burst open, and with a gust of cold wind, Annie rushed inside. “Jack! Guess what!” she whispered. “It’s back!”

“How do you know?” said Jack.

“I was walking home from the library”— Annie paused to catch her breath—“and I saw a flash in the sky above the woods. The last time that happened—”

Before she could finish the sentence, Jack jumped up. “Dad, Annie and I are going to go outside for a while!” he shouted. “Can the hot chocolate wait till we get back?”

“Sure, have fun!” their dad called from the kitchen.

“I have to get my pack,” Jack said to Annie. “Meet you on the porch.”

“Don’t forget the rhyme book!” said Annie.

Annie slipped outside and Jack ran up to his room. He grabbed his backpack. He checked to make sure their book of magic rhymes was inside. Good, there it was.



Jack charged back downstairs. He pulled on his boots, put on his jacket, tied a scarf around his neck, grabbed his mittens, and headed out the door.

“Come on!” said Annie.

Jack could see his breath in the cold air. “Brrr,” he said. “Let’s hurry!”

Jack and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They wove between the trees, their boots crunching through the fallen leaves.

Jack stopped. The magic tree house was back. High in a tall oak tree, it was silhouetted against the gray November sky. “You were right,” he said to Annie. “Good work.”

“Thanks,” Annie said. She ran to the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her.

When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack and Annie saw a book and a scroll of parchment paper lying on the floor. Annie picked up the scroll, unrolled it, and read aloud.

Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,

I am sending you on one more mission to

prove that you can use magic wisely. This

poem will guide you.

—M.



The very last unicorn

Is now hidden well

By those who have put him

Under a spell.



Four centuries, four decades

From that afternoon,

At the end of November,

Before the blue moon,



He will wake once more

And be free to go home

If you call out his name:

Divine Flower of Rome.



You must coax him to stand

Once his name is spoken.

His chain will break

And the spell, too, be broken.



Then a young girl must love him

And show him the way,

Lest he be trapped forever

On public display.



If he loses this chance

To rise and depart,

All magic will fade

From his horn and his heart.



“A unicorn!” breathed Annie. “I love him already. I’ll show him the way!”

“But this poem is really hard to understand,” said Jack. “What kind of research book did Morgan send us?”

He picked up the book that had been left for them by Morgan le Fay, the librarian of Camelot. The cover showed a row of skyscrapers. The title was New York City Guide Book, 1938.

“New York City?” said Annie. “I love New York City! Remember the great time we had there with Aunt Mallory?”



“Yeah, I love it, too,” said Jack. “But why would there be a unicorn in New York City in 1938? A unicorn is an ancient fantasy creature. New York City’s a real place, and 1938 is not even that long ago.”

“You’re right,” said Annie. “It sounds like a hard mission. But don’t forget we have Teddy and Kathleen’s magic rhymes to help us.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He pulled out the book given to them by their friends Teddy and Kathleen, two young enchanters of Camelot. “The problem is, we can only use each rhyme once, and we’ve already used seven out of the ten.”

“Which means we still have three left,” said Annie. “What are they?”

“Pull a Cloud from the Sky,” said Jack.

“Cool,” said Annie.

“Yeah, it is,” said Jack. “But I’m not sure it will be much use.” He looked back at the book. “Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose,” he said.

“Hey, that’s a really good one!” said Annie. “The unicorn’s a treasure. So that rhyme could take care of our whole mission.”

“But it only partly fits,” said Jack. “You could call the unicorn a treasure. But once we find him, we have to lose him. He has to go back home.”

“Oh, right…,” said Annie. “What else?”

“Your favorite,” said Jack. “Turn into Ducks.”

Annie laughed. “I can’t wait to use that one!” she said.

“I hope we never use that one,” said Jack. He didn’t want to waddle around and quack like a duck. “These leftover rhymes don’t seem very helpful to me.”

“Well, let’s just wait and see,” said Annie. “But now…” She held up Morgan’s research book and smiled.

Jack nodded. “New York City, here we come,” he said. He pointed at the book’s cover. “I wish we could go there!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Who Are They?




Snow blew into the tree house.

Jack and Annie wore wool coats, hats, and mittens. Jack’s canvas backpack had turned into a leather briefcase with buckles and a shoulder strap. Jack and Annie looked out the window.

Below the tree house was a wide, snow-covered field that ended in a wall of evergreen trees. Beyond the trees was a city skyline.

“This is definitely New York,” said Annie. “See the Empire State Building? Remember our visit to the top?” She pointed to a faraway building that rose above the others. “This must be Central Park. I remember that big field.”



“Yeah, I do, too,” said Jack. “But we’ve landed in New York in 1938. It was different back then.” He opened their research book and read from the introduction:

The city of New York is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere. It covers an area of 322 square miles.



Jack closed the book. “Whoa. Even in 1938, New York was a huge city,” he said. “This is going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack.”

“I’ll read our mission poem again,” said Annie. She read the first verse aloud:

The very last unicorn

Is now hidden well

By those who have put him

Under a spell.



“Okay, so this unicorn was put under a spell,” said Jack, “and he must be hidden somewhere in New York, or Merlin wouldn’t have sent us here.”

“Right,” said Annie. She read the next verse:

Four centuries, four decades

From that afternoon,

At the end of November,

Before the blue moon,



“What’s a blue moon?” asked Annie, looking up. “I’ve heard that expression before.”

“It’s when you have two full moons in the same month,” said Jack. “It doesn’t happen very often.”

“Oh,” said Annie. She read on:

He will wake once more

And be free to go home

If you call out his name:

Divine Flower of Rome.



“Wait, does that mean the unicorn’s name is Divine Flower of Rome?” asked Jack.

“I guess,” said Annie. She read on:

You must coax him to stand

Once his name is spoken.

His chain will breaks

And the spell, too, be broken.



Then a young girl must love him

And show him the way,

Lest he be trapped forever

On public display.



If he loses this chance

To rise and depart,

All magic will fade

From his horn and his heart.



“So I’m the young girl!” said Annie. “And I have to help him get home, or his magic will fade away forever!”

“Right,” said Jack. “Okay. Let’s review: There’s a unicorn on public display somewhere in New York City. He’s under a spell. The spell runs out in late November before a blue moon. But he’ll only wake up when someone calls his name, which is Divine Flower of Rome. Then a young girl—you— must love him and show him the way home.”

“Great,” said Annie. “Let’s get started.”

“Get started? How?” said Jack.

“Maybe we should talk to some New Yorkers,” said Annie. “We can ask them if they know anything about a unicorn in New York City.” She looked out the window. “There’re some people in the park right now.”

Jack looked out. Through the falling snow, he saw girls crossing the field carrying skates. He saw two people standing on top of a small hill. One wore a cape, and the other a long raincoat.

“If we start asking people about unicorns, they’ll think we’re crazy,” said Jack.

“Who cares?” said Annie. “Maybe someone will at least know something that can help us. Let’s go down.” She started down the ladder.

Jack quickly packed up their books. He buckled his bag and followed her. When they stepped onto the ground, Jack and Annie looked around. The skaters were gone. The two people on the hill were gone, too.

“Where’d everybody go?” said Jack.

“I don’t know. But we’ll find someone else. Come on,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie started across the wide field. The snow was falling fast and furiously. The wind blew harder.

“Look, a frozen pond,” said Annie, pointing. “That must be where the skaters were coming from.”

Wet snow stuck to Jack’s glasses. He wiped them off so he could see. No one was skating on the pond now. Whirlwinds of powdery snow swirled over the ice.

“Keep going,” said Jack.

They kept trudging through the snow.

“Hey, look! Remember that?” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack. He wiped the snow off his glasses again. He saw a merry-go-round. “Oh, yeah.” On their trip to New York with their aunt Mallory, they’d taken a ride on it. But now the riderless painted horses looked sad and lonely.



“I feel like we’re the last living creatures in Central Park,” said Jack.

“Which way do we go now?” asked Annie. “Which way did we come from?”

It was hard to see anything in the white haze of the falling snow. The buildings bordering the park and the skyscrapers in the distance had disappeared.

“Let’s see what our book says,” said Jack. He unbuckled his leather briefcase and pulled out their research book. He found a picture of Central Park and read:

Central Park is a vast natural area in the middle of New York City. The park has thirty-two miles of winding footpaths and covers 840 acres of land. It has rock formations, woods, and many bodies of water. It also has—



“Okay, okay, got it,” said Annie. “It’s a big park. Is there a map that shows where we are?”

Jack tried to read from the index, but the wind and snow made it impossible. He stuffed the book back into his briefcase. “Forget it,” he said. “Let’s just try to get out of the park.”

Jack and Annie turned away from the lonely merry-go-round and walked across the snow. A gust of wind blew Jack’s cap off. As he turned around to grab it, he saw a couple walking a short distance behind them.

The two people looked like teenagers. They were walking with their heads bowed against the wind. The girl wore a dark cape with a hood. The boy wore a hat and a tan raincoat with a belt.

“Hey, look—” Jack said to Annie. But at that moment, the wind shook the trees, and big clumps of snow fell from the branches. Jack and Annie ducked and covered their heads. When the wind died down, Jack looked around for the couple.

“They’re gone now,” he said.

“Who’s gone?” said Annie. “Who did you see?”

“Two teenagers, I think,” said Jack. “A boy and a girl. We saw them earlier from the tree house. I think they might be following us.”

“Wait a second,” said Annie. “Two teenagers? A boy and a girl? Following us? Who does that remind you of?”

A big smile crossed Jack’s face. “Teddy and Kathleen?” he said.

“Think about it,” said Annie. “On our last three missions, it seemed like Teddy and

Kathleen were always nearby, wearing disguises, ready to help us when we needed it.”

“Right,” said Jack. “We could sure use their help now.” He turned around. “Hello!” he shouted.

“Hello!” Annie yelled.

But the wind answered them with a howl. More clumps of snow blew down on Jack and Annie.

“Let’s get going,” said Annie. “They’ll find us sooner or later. They always do.”

3. Lost in Central Park




Jack and Annie kept walking until they came to the ice pond again. “We’ve been here before,” said Jack. “We’re going in circles. How do we get out of the park?”

“We have to try to walk in a straight line,” said Annie.

Annie and Jack struggled on. Jack kept looking back, trying to catch sight of Teddy and Kathleen again. But it was getting harder and harder to see anything. Wet snow kept sticking to his glasses. Snow had blown up the sleeves of his jacket, under his neck scarf, and into his mittens.

“Yikes!” said Annie. She grabbed Jack’s arm. “Look!”

A huge wolf-like dog stood on a ledge above them, his mouth open.

“Whoa!” said Jack.

The dog didn’t move. He stood perfectly still.



Annie laughed. “Oh, he’s a statue!” she said. She ran to a plaque under the dog statue, brushed off the snow, and shouted to Jack. “His name is Balto! In 1925, he carried medicine six hundred miles through a blizzard in Alaska!”

“That’s really great,” said Jack. “But how do we get out of the park?”

“Well, if we follow this path, it’s bound to lead somewhere,” said Annie.

Jack followed Annie up a wide path. They walked and walked, passing a snow-covered outdoor stage and a fountain with the statue of an angel. Raising her outspread wings, the angel seemed about to fly away.

“Which way now?” said Jack.

Two paths led away from the angel fountain: one to the right, one to the left. “I don’t know,” said Annie. “Pick one.”

Jack headed to the left. Annie followed. They passed a frozen lake and walked over an arched bridge. Jack kept his eyes on the ground and walked and walked and walked. Every time he lifted his head, the snow felt like needles against his skin.

Jack tried to keep walking in a straight line, but the path they were following began twisting and turning like a maze. Different paths branched off, curving this way and that. Jack remembered information from their research book: The park has thirty-two miles of winding footpaths.

“We have got to get off these paths!” he shouted to Annie. “Or we’ll be lost in Central Park forever!”

Annie didn’t answer. “Annie!” Jack shielded his face from the cutting wind and looked back. He didn’t see her.

Jack turned around and around, looking for Annie. But he couldn’t see anything—the world was completely white.

“Annie!” he cried. Had she gone off on another path? Was she lost? “Annie!”

She could wander around in the storm for

hours! thought Jack. She could freeze to death! I have to find her!

Jack tried to stay calm. He took a few breaths. A rhyme, he thought. He couldn’t remember which magic rhymes were left. He struggled to unbuckle his briefcase—his fingers felt frozen. He pulled out the book and hunched over it, trying to shelter it from the storm. He wiped his glasses off and read: Turn into Ducks. That wouldn’t help. Pull a Cloud from the Sky. That would only make things worse. Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose.

Is Annie a treasure? Jack wondered. He’d always thought of a “treasure” as something super valuable, like gold or silver or rare jewels. But right now Annie seemed more valuable than any of those things. She seemed like the most valuable thing in the world. Jack found the rhyme and shouted:

Treasure forever must never be lost!

Um-motta cal, um-motta bost!



“Jack!”

Jack whirled around. Annie was standing right behind him. “There you are,” she said. “I was afraid you got lost.”

“ I wasn’t lost,” said Jack. “You were lost.” He slipped the rhyme book back into his briefcase.

“Not me, you,” said Annie.

“Whatever,” said Jack. “Just stay near me now.” He took her hand and gripped it tightly. “Okay, let’s figure out what to do.”

“Wait, is that a castle over there?” said Annie.

“A what?” said Jack.

“A castle. Look!”

Peering through the storm, Jack saw a small castle sitting on top of a snowy hill. A light burned in a window.

“A castle in Central Park?” Jack said. “That’s weird.”

“Let’s go see if anyone’s inside,” said Annie. “Maybe they can help us. People in a castle might know about unicorns.”



“Or at least know how to get out of the park,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie struggled up the stone steps that led to the castle. At the top of the steps, Jack glanced back at the park. He could barely make out two figures in the snow: one in a dark cape and one in a raincoat.

“Them—it’s them!” said Jack.

A cloud of wind-driven snow blew over the couple. Jack kept looking, eager for another glimpse of the two young enchanters. But the snow hid everything in sight.

“They’ll find us,” said Annie. “Come on.” She pushed open the door to the castle and led the way inside.

The door slammed shut behind them. Jack and Annie stood in a dimly lit hallway.

“Hello? Who’s there?” a man called.

“Jack and Annie!” shouted Annie.

A tall, thin man came down a curving stone stairway. He wore an old-fashioned blue-striped suit. “Goodness! Two children!” he said. “What are you doing here on a day like today?”

“We got lost in the park,” said Jack. “My name’s Jack and this is my sister, Annie.”

“Pleased to meet you. I’m Bill Perkins,” said the man. “Welcome to Belvedere Castle.”

“What is this place?” asked Annie.

“The castle was built in 1869,” said Mr. Perkins. “It was meant to be a delightful surprise when one wandered the park. Today it’s a delightful surprise with a nature observatory and weather instruments inside.”

“Weather instruments?” said Jack.

“Yes. I’ve come from the U.S. Weather Bureau to check them,” said Mr. Perkins. “I’m afraid right now our data is telling us that the weather’s undergoing a rapid and terrible change.”

Jack shivered in his damp clothes. “Our data is telling us the same thing,” he said.

“A storm has blown in from the Midwest, bringing wind and snow,” said Mr. Perkins. “But after nightfall, things will get worse. Another storm is coming up from the South, gathering speed on its way.”

“That sounds serious,” said Annie.

“It’s worse than serious,” Mr. Perkins said. “It’s disastrous. After dark, the two systems will meet and create a monster blizzard! It could be the worst in New York history! Even worse than the Blizzard of ’88!”

Jack caught his breath.

“Poor New York,” said Annie.

“Ah, yes, it’s the last thing our great city needs during these hard times,” said Mr. Perkins, shaking his head.

“Excuse me, but I have a question,” said Annie. “Do you know if there’s a full moon tonight?”

“Well, yes, there is,” said Bill Perkins. “You won’t see it, though—not through those storm clouds. Actually, it’ll be the second full moon this month.”

“A blue moon!” said Annie.

“You’re exactly right, a blue moon indeed,” said Mr. Perkins.

“I have another question,” said Annie. “Do you know where we can find—”

“Um—any unusual animals?” Jack interrupted. “On public display somewhere? In New York City?”

“Well, your best bet in New York would be the Bronx Zoo,” said Mr. Perkins. “They display all kinds of animals from all over the world.”

“Great!” said Annie. “How do we get there?”

“What? You can’t go to the zoo today!” said Mr. Perkins. “Not in this storm!”

“No, no, of course not,” Jack said quickly. “But if we ever decide to go to the zoo—in the future— how would we get there?”

“Well, the best way would be to take the West Side IRT,” said Mr. Perkins.

“What’s that?” said Jack.

“A subway line that runs up the West Side,” said Mr. Perkins. “The number two train on that line will take you to the Bronx Zoo.”

“Oh, great, thanks for everything,” said Jack. “We’d better get going now.” He and Annie started toward the door.

“Wait, there’s a telephone upstairs. Let me ring up your parents. Perhaps they can come get you,” said Mr. Perkins.

“Um, well,” said Annie. “We—uh—we haven’t lived here very long, and we don’t have a telephone yet.”

“She’s right,” said Jack. “But it’s not far to where we live. We just need to get out of the park to the street.”

“To the West Side!” said Annie.

“Yeah, yeah, the West Side,” said Jack. “Can you tell us how to get there from here?”

“Certainly!” Mr. Perkins opened the door. Wind and snow blasted inside as he pointed to the right. “Cross the terrace and then walk down the stairs to a path. That path will take you out of the park to Eighty-first Street,” he said. “Hurry home now!”

“We will!” said Jack.

“Thanks a lot, Mr. Perkins!” said Annie. And she and Jack headed back out into the blizzard.

4. Hard Times




The wind lashed the bare trees and swept the snow into tall drifts. “That way!” said Annie. She led the way down the castle steps to the path.

“Mr. Perkins was a nice guy,” said Annie as they headed toward the west side of the park.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Someday I’d like to go back there and see all his weather instruments.”

Jack and Annie trudged through the storm, until they saw buildings just beyond the trees.

“We’re almost out of Central Park!” Annie said.

Jack looked around. “Do you see Teddy and Kathleen?” he said.

“No, but we’d better keep going if we want to get to the zoo today,” said Annie.

Jack agreed. Mr. Perkins had said that the blizzard was going to turn into a monster after dark. And dark came early in November.

They left the park and came to a wide city street. All sorts of things were blowing about in the wind: newspapers, hats, and umbrellas turned inside out. Jack and Annie grabbed a lamppost and clung to it, trying to keep from getting blown away, too. When there was a lull in the storm, they trudged across the avenue. It was lined with cars half buried in the snow.

Jack and Annie started down a side street. They passed an old man and woman huddled in a doorway, wrapped in torn blankets, burning a fire in a small stove. They passed a line of men dressed in ragged clothes standing outside a building. A sign said “Free Soup.”



Jack hoped everyone outside would find better shelter before the monster blizzard hit.

“Excuse me!” Annie called to the men in the line for free soup. “Do you know where the West Side IRT subway is?”

“Two blocks!” said a man. “Keep going!”

“Thanks!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie kept going. They passed a firehouse, a cheese store, and a newsstand. Everything was closed and shuttered. Peddlers’ carts were stuck in drifts.

Signs banged in the wind. One said:



Another said:



A third said:



Jack and Annie crossed the street. They saw newsboys huddled under a theater awning. The boys had wrapped their feet and legs in newspapers to keep warm.

“Excuse me, where’s the subway?” Jack shouted.

“End of the block and around the corner! Green ball!” said a boy.

Green ball? wondered Jack. What does that mean?

“Thanks!” said Annie. “You guys should go home! After dark, the storm’s turning into a monster!”

Jack and Annie trudged on. When they turned the corner, Annie shouted, “Look! A green ball!”

On top of a post was a large green ball. The post was next to a stairway that led underground. A sign said:





UPTOWN IRT TRAINS, 1,2,3


“That’s it! Mr. Perkins said we take the number two!” said Annie.

“Wait, do you see Teddy and Kathleen?” said Jack, peering through the snow. Annie looked with him down the city street.

“I don’t see them. But I’m sure they’ll find us,” said Annie. She and Jack started down the stairs that led underground. The stairway was filled with people trying to get out of the storm. Jack and Annie walked with the crowd into the subway station.

A long line waited in front of a turnstile. A sign over the turnstile said:





SUBWAY: 5¢


“Oops, do you have any money for the subway?” Annie asked Jack.

“Yeah, I think I left home with at least a dollar in change,” said Jack. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two nickels.

“Cool,” said Annie. She led the way to the line.

As they waited, Jack looked around the station. A banjo player played a silly tune, but no one smiled. A man in rags walked around, holding out a hat, begging for money. Jack took another nickel from his pocket and dropped it into the hat.

“Thank you, thank you. Bless you,” said the beggar.

“Sure,” said Jack.

As the beggar walked on, Jack looked at Annie. “Boy, just a little nickel made him so happy,” he said.

“I know. Everyone seems really poor and desperate here,” said Annie.

“I wonder why,” said Jack. While the line moved slowly toward the turnstile, he pulled out their research book. He read aloud from the introduction:

In the 1930s, New York City, as well as the rest of the United States, suffered through hard times known as the Great Depression. Jobs were scarce, and many people had no money or homes.

“That’s what Mr. Perkins was talking about,” said Jack. “Hard times.”

“I wish we could help everyone,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“But right now our mission is to save a unicorn under a spell,” said Annie.

Jack frowned. “Our mission sounds like a fairy tale from a make-believe world,” he said. “Not the real world of the Great Depression.”

“I know,” said Annie. “Hey, it’s almost our turn. What do we do?”

“Let’s watch the person in front of us,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie watched an old woman put her nickel in the slot of the turnstile, which led to the train platform. The woman pushed through and joined the crowd of people waiting for the train. Jack and Annie put their nickels into the slot and pushed through, too.

The platform was bitterly cold. People looked worried, as if they feared the subway train might never come. Jack felt worried, too, but mainly because their mission wasn’t making any sense. They were trying to get to the zoo before the blue moon, and before a monster blizzard hit the city. But when they got to the zoo, what then?

“This is what I don’t understand,” Jack said to Annie. “The poem says the unicorn is on public display. But if that’s true, why haven’t we ever read about New York City once having a unicorn in a zoo? That would be major news.”

“Yeah, but remember the poem says he’s ‘hidden well,’ and he’s ‘under a spell,’” said Annie. “So maybe the spell makes him look like a regular animal. But when we get to the zoo and say his name, he’ll come out of hiding and—and—”

“Reveal his true nature?” said Jack.

“Exactly!” said Annie.

“Okay …,” said Jack. “But how will we know what kind of animal to look for?”

A signal bell clanged. Lights appeared at the end of the tunnel. Jack and Annie moved with the crowd as it surged forward.

The subway train rumbled down the tracks. On the side of the train, Jack saw a big number 2. “That’s us!” he said.



When the train stopped, everyone on the platform crammed inside. Jack and Annie were squashed into one of the first cars. All the seats were taken, so they had to stand in the aisle. They held on to a silver pole as more riders squeezed into the subway car and grabbed straps hanging overhead. Jack actually didn’t mind the tight squeeze. He was anxious to thaw out from the cold.

“Look, Jack!” cried Annie. She pointed out a window of the subway car.

Jack peered out the window, just in time to see two people rush across the platform toward one of the rear cars. One was dressed in a dark cape, the other in a tan raincoat.

A bell sounded. The subway doors closed and the train started down the tracks.

“Yay! They’re on the train!” exclaimed Annie.

“Cool,” said Jack, grinning. “We’ll see them when we get off.”

“Hey, where do we get off?” said Annie.

“Oh, man, we forgot to ask!” said Jack. He turned to the lady next to them.

“Excuse me, where do we get off for the Bronx Zoo?” he asked her.

“Tremont Avenue,” the woman said gruffly.

“Where’s that?” asked Annie.

“There’s a map,” said the woman. She pointed to a map on the wall above a row of seated passengers.

Jack and Annie stared at all the colorful lines that showed the subway system. “Nothing here makes sense,” said Jack.

“Do you need help?” the girl sitting under the map said. She wore a tattered purple shawl over her head and shoulders.

“Yes, please,” said Annie. “Can you tell us where we get off for the Bronx Zoo?”

“It’s much further north,” said the girl. “I’ll let you know when we get to the right stop.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.

The train bumped and creaked along, stopping every couple of minutes. Jack looked out the window and tried to read the name of each station, but sometimes the platforms were too crowded. He was glad the girl in the shawl had promised to help them.

Just when Jack was starting to feel warm and a little drowsy, the girl called out, “Your stop’s next!”

“Thanks a lot!” said Annie. She and Jack squeezed through the crowd toward the doors. When the train stopped and the doors opened, Jack and Annie were practically pushed out onto the platform with the other people leaving.

The subway doors closed and the train moved on.

5. The Cloisters




“Do you see Teddy and Kathleen?” asked Jack.

The crowd was swarming away from the subway platform toward different exits. Jack couldn’t see anyone who looked like the two young enchanters.

“No,” said Annie. “But if we figured out where to get off, I’m sure they did, too. Let’s hurry and get to the zoo. We can meet up with them there.”

Jack and Annie moved with the crowd. They passed a change booth on the way out of the station. “Wait, I’ll ask where to go,” said Annie. She waited in line and then leaned forward to talk to the man in the booth. “Do you know how to walk to the Bronx Zoo from here?” she said.

“Walk to the Bronx Zoo? Are you out of your mind?” said the man. “This isn’t the stop for the Bronx Zoo! It’s much further north.”

“You mean we got out at the wrong stop?” said Annie.

“You did, but it doesn’t matter,” said the man. “You can’t get there now, anyway. The tracks near the zoo are above ground. And I just got word they’re buried in snow.”

“Oh, no,” said Jack.

“Lousy day for the zoo, anyway,” said the man. “Next!”

Jack and Annie stepped away from the booth and walked out of the subway station. The sidewalk was deserted. “Oh, man, that girl gave us the wrong information,” said Jack.

“This is terrible,” said Annie.

“No kidding,” said Jack. He looked around, wondering what to do next.

AH-U-GA! AH-U-GA!

“What’s that?” said Jack.

“It looks like a taxi.” Annie pointed at a big yellow car with a checkerboard stripe and writing on the side. Its horn let out a loud squawk: AH-U-GA! AH-U-GA!

The driver stuck his head out the window. He wore a big furry cap that came down over his ears. “Need a taxi?” he called.

“Yes!” shouted Annie. “Come on, Jack! He can take us to the zoo!” Jack hurried after her through the snow.

The taxi driver stepped out of the cab and opened the back door. “Hop in!” he said. His cheerful voice was muffled through a plaid scarf that covered half his face.

“Thanks!” said Jack. He stepped onto a running board and then climbed inside.

The taxi was very roomy. Jack could stretch his legs out and not even touch the front seat. “Boy, lots more room in old cars than ours,” he said to Annie.

“Yeah,” said Annie. “And there’s no seat belts.”

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack. “I guess old cars didn’t have any. I hope this guy is a good driver.”

The driver slid open a little window that separated the front seat from the back. “Where to?” he asked.

“Can you please take us to the Bronx Zoo?” said Annie.

“We’re in a big hurry to get there,” said Jack.

“Sure thing, kiddos,” said the driver.

“Great,” said Jack.

“Oh, how much will it cost?” asked Annie.

“About thirty cents,” said the driver. “Can you afford it?”

“Sure thing, kiddo,” said Annie.

The driver laughed and closed the window.

Then the taxi began moving through the snow.

“Everything’s so cheap here,” Annie said to Jack.

“To us it is,” said Jack. “But it’s the Great Depression. Lots of people don’t even have a nickel.”

The taxi slid over the icy road and bumped over the curb. “Whoa!” said Jack, slipping off the seat.

“Sorry, kiddos!” called the driver. He got the taxi back onto the street. Then he plowed on through the snow, swerving this way and that.

The ride seemed dangerous in the bad weather, but Jack didn’t want to get out now. He stared nervously out the window. The streets were empty of people. All the stores were closed and shuttered. Snow was piling up on apartment stoops, fire escapes, and iron balconies. Many of the buildings were shabby and crumbling, with broken windows.

“Hard times,” Annie said softly.

“Yep,” said Jack. He took a deep breath.

The taxi climbed up a road lined with tall evergreen trees. Suddenly it skidded and came to a stop. The engine roared, but the taxi’s wheels only spun in the snow.

“What’s happening?” Jack wondered aloud. He tapped on the glass that separated them from the driver.

The driver slid the window open. “Too bad, kiddos, looks like I’m stuck,” he said.

“Are we near the zoo?” asked Annie.

“It’s still a long ways from here, I’m sorry to say,” said the driver. “But this taxi’s not going anywhere. I don’t know what else to tell you.”

“Oh. Well, thanks,” said Annie. “How much do we owe you?”

“Forget it, kiddo,” said the driver. “Good luck!”

“Good luck yourself, kiddo,” said Annie. She opened the door, and she and Jack climbed out into the cold wind. The taxi motor kept running, but the wheels only spun in place, sending up sprays of dirty snow.

“I don’t believe this,” said Jack.

“Maybe there’s a subway station somewhere near here,” said Annie.

“The man in the booth said the subways aren’t running all the way to the zoo,” said Jack.

“I know, but maybe we can at least get closer,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie struggled through the storm until they came to a steep cliff. Over the edge of the cliff they saw nothing but a cloud of wind-blown snow.

“Where are we?” said Annie.

“I have no idea,” said Jack. His teeth chattered. His eyes and ears stung with the cold, and his hands and feet felt numb. Isn’t this what frostbite feels like? he thought. Numb?

“Let’s go back and sit in that taxi until we figure out what to do,” said Jack. “At least get out of the wind.”

“Okay,” said Annie. “Maybe the driver will get it going again.”

Jack and Annie headed back the way they’d come. But the taxi was gone!

“Hey, he must’ve got unstuck!” said Annie. “And he left us!”

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “We’re having really rotten luck. And I think I’m starting to get frostbite. Seriously.”

“It looks like there’s a building over there,” said Annie. “I see a tower.”

“Yeah, me too,” said Jack. “Let’s go there and try to figure out what to do next.”

Jack and Annie trekked up what looked like a long driveway until they came to the gray stone building. Jack wiped snow from a sign in front.





CLOISTERS OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, OPEN TO THE PUBLIC


“A museum!” said Annie. “Let’s go in and ask them how to get to the zoo.”

“Yeah, and get warm for a minute,” said Jack.

He and Annie climbed the snow-covered steps of the Cloisters. Annie opened the door, and the wind nearly swept them inside.

They pushed the door shut.

“Ah! My first visitors all day!” a woman chirped.

Jack and Annie turned around. A museum lady sat at a desk in a corner. Dressed in a green uniform, she was tall and thin with a friendly face and short gray hair.

“I’m sorry, but we can’t stay long,” said Annie. “We just came here to get warm for a minute and get some information.”

“What can I tell you?” the woman asked.

“We’re trying to get to the Bronx Zoo,” said Jack. “Is there a subway near here?”

“Well, the A train is close by,” said the museum lady. “But that won’t take you anywhere near the zoo.”

“Oh, darn,” said Annie.

“Oh, I wouldn’t be so sad,” the woman said brightly. “If I were you, I’d stay right here and enjoy the Cloisters! You won’t regret it, I promise. The Cloisters holds most of the medieval collection of the world-famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.”

“What’s a cloister?” Annie asked.

“It’s an enclosed garden or courtyard,” said the museum lady. “We have four in all. They beautifully evoke medieval times, from the Romanesque period to the light, airy elegance of the Gothic.”

“Cool,” said Jack politely. He had no idea what she was talking about.

“I suppose the gardens are cool most days, my dear,” said the woman. “But today they are freezing! Never mind, you don’t have to spend time in the gardens to enjoy the museum. Inside, we have many beautiful exhibits. The tapestries are especially lovely. They were woven with beautiful yarns by weavers from the Netherlands. For years, they hung in a French castle and managed to escape destruction during the Revolution. Then, for two generations—”

“Excuse me,” said Jack. He was eager to end the woman’s boring lecture so they could be on their way.

But she kept talking excitedly. “The tapestries were used by peasants to protect potatoes stored in their barns until, eventually, a countess rescued them. They were restored, and in 1922, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., bought them. Just last year, Mr. Rockefeller gave them as gifts to—”

“Oh, that is so cool!” interrupted Jack loudly. He pretended to be interested so they could escape. “We’d love to see them! Where are they?”

“The tapestry room is just on the other side of the first cloister,” the woman said, pointing. “Turn that corner, go out the door, and then walk through the garden to the door of the tapestry room.”

“Let’s go, Annie. Quick!” said Jack. He and Annie went around the corner, out the door, and into a snowy garden.

“Whew!” said Jack. “I didn’t want to be rude. But we’re short on time.”

“I know,” said Annie.



“What now?” said Jack, shivering in the cold.

“We need to figure out exactly where we are,” said Annie, “and where the Bronx Zoo is. Maybe we can just walk there from here.”

“Come on, let’s get inside the tapestry room and check our research book for a map,” said Jack.

They walked along the edge of the garden under a covered walkway. When they came to a door, Jack pushed it open, and he and Annie slipped out of the cold into a large, warm room.

Jack closed the door against the storm and unbuckled his briefcase to take out their research book.

“Ohh … wow!” breathed Annie.

“What? What?” said Jack. He looked up.

The walls of the room were covered with cloth hangings—tapestries shimmering with gold and silver.

“Oh … !” whispered Jack.

“A unicorn!” said Annie.

6. The Hunt of the Unicorn




There were seven tapestries in all. Each was almost as high as the wooden ceiling. Jack read aloud from a sign on the wall under the first one:

The Hunt of the Unicorn

Tapestries woven in the Netherlands

at the end of the 1400s



The first tapestry showed hunters and hounds searching for the unicorn. The second showed the unicorn being found.

The other tapestries showed the unicorn trying to escape, leaping from a stream, chased by hounds, then captured and slain by the hunters’ spears.

Oddly, the last tapestry showed the unicorn alive again. He was sitting in a garden of flowers surrounded by a wooden fence. There was a wide blue and gold collar around his neck, and he was chained to a tree.

“That’s him,” Annie said softly.

“How can it be him?” said Jack. “He’s a picture in a tapestry.”

“Read Merlin’s poem again,” said Annie.

Jack unbuckled his briefcase and pulled out the parchment scroll. He read aloud.

The very last unicorn

Is now hidden well

By those who have put him

Under a spell.



“The unicorn is hidden in the tapestry,” said Annie. “The people who wove it must be the ones who put him under a spell.”

“Hmm …,” said Jack. He read on.

Four centuries, four decades

From that afternoon,

At the end of November,

Before the blue moon …



“Stop, do the math,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. He took out his notebook and pencil. “Okay, four centuries is four hundred, and four decades is forty. Add ’em up, you get four hundred forty. Then if you subtract four hundred forty from 1938, you get… 1498.”

“It works!” said Annie. “The sign says the tapestries were woven at the end of the 1400s! And it’s the end of November, and Mr. Perkins said there’s a blue moon tonight!”

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. He kept reading.

He will wake once more

And be free to go home

If you call out his name:

Divine Flower of Rome.



Annie looked up at the tapestry. “Divine Flower!” she called.

Nothing happened.

“Divine Flower of Rome!” Jack called.

Jack and Annie watched and waited. Nothing changed in the tapestry. It looked exactly the same.

“Maybe he’s not the right unicorn after all,” said Jack.

“Maybe it’s just not the right name,” said Annie. “Read the rest.”

Jack read more of the poem.

You must coax him to stand

Once his name is spoken.

His chain will break

And the sipell, too, be broken.



“He is the right unicorn!” said Annie. “See? There’s the chain!” She pointed to the chain in the last tapestry.

“Yeah, but why didn’t calling his name work?” said Jack. “Why didn’t he wake up?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “What else does the poem say?”

Jack read on.

Then a young girl must love him

And show him the way,

Lest he be trapped forever

On public display.

If he loses this chance

To rise and depart,

All magic will fade

From his horn and his heart.



“He is on public display, and I’m the girl, Jack!” said Annie. “I love him a lot! I’ll show him the way!”

“Okay, calm down. First we need to wake him up,” said Jack.

Voices came from outside. Jack moved to a window. He looked out into the courtyard. Two people were coming through the cloister, their heads down against the flying snow. One wore a dark cape, and the other a tan raincoat.

Jack turned back to Annie, a big grin on his face. “You were right! They found us! Teddy and

Kathleen are here!” he said. “They’ll know how to break the spell!”

“Of course!” said Annie, beaming. “Quick, let’s hide and surprise them for a change.”

“In there!” said Jack. He and Annie hurried into a long room off the tapestry room. They heard the door from the cloister open. They felt a rush of cold air. They heard footsteps.

Jack and Annie grinned at each other. Jack put his finger to his lips. Then a quick, nervous boy’s voice came from the tapestry room: “Grinda, they are not here!”

“I see that, Balor, but look—”

“Ahh! Is it him, Grinda?”

Annie grabbed Jack’s arm. “Balor? Grinda?” she whispered.

“Shh,” whispered Jack.

“Of course ’tis him!” said the girl. “I told you those Frog Creek brats would lead us to him! Get the rope ready!”

“Aye,” said the boy.

Jack and Annie carefully peeked around the corner. They saw a girl and boy standing with their backs to them, facing the unicorn in the last tapestry. The boy held a thick black rope.

“Call out his name, Grinda,” said the boy.

The girl took a step toward the tapestry. She raised her arms in front of the unicorn. “Dianthus!” she called.

Wind whistled through the open doorway. The flowers in the tapestry swayed as if the wind were blowing them. The scent of roses wafted through the room. The unicorn moved his head.



“Ohh!” whispered Annie.

“Get ready, Balor, to take him back to the Master,” said the girl.

Annie clutched Jack’s arm. “Who’s the Master?” she whispered.

“I don’t know,” whispered Jack. “But I don’t think he’s a good guy.”

The girl turned back to the tapestry and spoke softly to the unicorn. “Come, come, my lovely Dianthus, stand up now. Come out of that old rug….”

The unicorn turned his head and looked out at the girl. The look in his blue eyes was ancient yet young, wise yet innocent. He lifted his head as if he were about to stand.

The girl nodded to the boy. The boy slowly coiled the black rope into a noose. The girl looked at the unicorn again. “Come to me, Dianthus!” she coaxed. “Don’t be afraid. I’ll love you and show you the way—”



“No, Dianthus!” yelled Annie. “Don’t go to her!” Annie and Jack bolted from their hiding place.

Balor and Grinda whirled around in surprise. They both had pale faces and pale shining eyes.

“Leave him alone!” Annie yelled at the strange pair. “You don’t love him! We love him!”

At that moment, there was a flash of light, and the unicorn in the tapestry leapt like a deer over the woven fence. Balor and Grinda shrieked and jumped back. Jack covered his head.

Then there was silence. Jack looked up. The tapestry on the wall was unchanged—it still showed a unicorn woven from yarn chained to a tree.

But standing on the floor of the museum was the most beautiful creature Jack had ever seen.

7. Dianthus




The unicorn had a broad milk-white chest and graceful neck. A tuft of hair curled under his chin. A long, spiraled horn rose from the middle of his forehead. He stood very still and very tall. His whole body seemed to be glowing.

Balor and Grinda just stared at him. They both looked frightened. But Annie stepped forward. “Hi, Dianthus,” she whispered. She reached out and gently touched the unicorn’s white chest. “Feel, Jack, feel his heart pounding.”

“Move away!” ordered Grinda. The girl stepped between Jack and Annie. “He is ours and he is coming with us.”

“He’s not yours!” said Annie.

“Who are you, anyway?” said Jack. “Where did you come from?”

Grinda glared at Jack. “We come from the same magic world he comes from,” she said. “He belongs with us, not you. Balor!”

The boy shoved Annie aside and tried to loop the black rope around the unicorn’s neck. But Dianthus reared up and wheeled around, forcing Balor and Grinda out of his way.

Dianthus leapt across the tapestry room toward the garden. Jack and Annie followed him through the open doorway into the snowy cloister. Balor and Grinda charged after them. They pushed past Jack and Annie to Dianthus. Balor grabbed the unicorn’s blue collar. “You are coming with us, stupid, like it or not!”

“Don’t pull on him!” yelled Annie. “And don’t call him stupid!”



Dianthus tried to back up.

“Let go!” screamed Annie. “He doesn’t want to go with you!”

“He has no choice,” said Grinda. “As soon as that rope goes around his neck, all three of us will be instantly transported back to the Castle of the Dark Wizard.”

“No!” Jack shouted. He charged at Balor and tried to grab the rope from his hand. Balor let go of the unicorn’s collar and shoved Jack into the snow. Then he turned back to the unicorn and began to swing the magic rope like a lasso.

Dianthus reared up again and kicked his legs. Breath from his nostrils billowed into the icy air.

“A rhyme, Jack!” yelled Annie. “A rhyme!”

Kneeling in the snow, Jack yanked the book from his briefcase. He frantically turned the pages, looking for a rhyme they hadn’t used. “Call a Cloud from the Sky?” he shouted to Annie.

“Anything!” she called. “Try it!”

Jack read the rhyme aloud:

Down from high, out of the sky,

Ee-no-fain-ee-ro-lie!

A thick white fog instantly filled the cloister. The fog was so dense that Jack couldn’t even see his own hand.

“Balor, where are you?” shrieked Grinda.

“Here!” the boy yelled.

Someone grabbed Jack. He struggled to break free. “Let me go!” he shouted.

“It’s me!” whispered Annie. “Come on!”

Jack stood up, clinging to Annie. They stumbled together through the garden. Feeling their way along the walkway, they came to the door that led to the main hall.

“Dianthus, here!” Annie whispered.

Jack heard the soft crunch of the unicorn’s hooves in the frozen snow.

“Where did he go?” Balor shouted.

“Find him!” yelled Grinda.

Jack reached out and felt the unicorn’s soft mane. Annie pushed open the door. Then she, Dianthus, and Jack slipped inside the main hall.

Jack closed the door before Balor and Grinda could escape the garden. There wasn’t a wisp of fog in the main hall. The museum lady was still behind her desk. She stared at Jack, Annie, and the glowing unicorn that had just come in from the garden. Her mouth opened, and then closed.

Dianthus stepped lightly over the wooden floor. Jack and Annie followed him.

The museum lady never blinked. As Dianthus walked gracefully past her desk, she reached out and touched him. She gasped and quickly drew back her hand.

“Thanks for keeping the museum open today,” said Annie. “And thank Mr. Rockefeller for his gifts.”

The museum lady opened and closed her mouth again, still unable to speak.

Jack opened the door that led to the street. Jack and Annie followed Dianthus out of the museum and down the stone steps. The blizzard had gotten much worse. Snow was coming down harder than ever. The wind was wailing. The unicorn shook his head and knelt down.

“He wants us to get on his back!” said Annie. “Quick! Climb on behind me!” Annie climbed onto the unicorn’s back. Jack climbed on behind her.

Dianthus stood up to his full height.

Grinda and Balor burst out the door of the museum. “Stop!” screamed Grinda.

Dianthus looked back at them. Then he leapt nimbly over a snowdrift and headed into the darkening storm.

8. Back to Life




Jack clung to Annie. Dianthus cleared the driveway of the Cloisters and began to run with ease down the street. His long strides were so light and graceful, Jack could hardly feel the movement.

As the unicorn ran, he held his head high. His long, spiraled horn pierced the raging storm, seeming to calm the winds and snow. Jack realized he could feel his fingers and toes again. His whole body began to feel warm.

Dianthus headed down a deserted parkway along the waterfront, past an empty bridge. The bridge’s towers and cables formed a silver arc over a wide river. Whitecaps swept across the water’s surface. As the unicorn trotted past the river, the water became still.

Dianthus left the riverside and headed down a city street. The wind whistled between tall buildings, blowing the snow into great drifts. But the unicorn’s horn turned the howling wind into a soft breeze. The wild blowing snow became floating, star-shaped flakes, like the snowflakes on Christmas cards.

As the unicorn trotted down the street, snow-bound taxis and streetcars started moving again. Lights came on in cafés and jazz clubs. Jack heard happy music coming from inside.

With a calm, steady trot, the unicorn pranced on through the city. As he moved past old mansions, broken-down tenements, and shabby hotels, people peeked out of doorways and windows to see why the sounds of the storm had died away. When they caught sight of Dianthus, with his horn shining in the windless air, they broke into joyful smiles. Church bells started ringing through the white silence.

Finally Dianthus came to a stone wall bordering Central Park. He jumped over the wall and landed knee-deep in a heap of snow. The unicorn leapt effortlessly out of the drift and cantered over a field and down a slope.

Slowly the clouds parted, and light from the setting sun poured down.

“Hot corn!” a peddler shouted, plowing his pushcart through the snow.

“Roasted chestnuts!” shouted another.

The good smells of the corn and nuts filled the crisp golden air of the park. The unicorn trotted past Belvedere Castle. Bill Perkins stood outside, staring up at the clear blue sky.



“Hey, Mr. Perkins, the monster storm’s not coming!” shouted Annie.

The weatherman saw Jack and Annie on the back of the white unicorn. His jaw dropped. Then he smiled and waved.

Jack and Annie rode on. When they passed the statue of the winged angel, Jack thought he saw her move her great wings. “Did you see that?” he cried.

“Yes!” said Annie.

When they passed the statue of Balto, Jack heard the sled dog bark.

When they rode past the merry-go-round, Jack heard a chorus of neighs and whinnies accompanied by lively carousel music.

Dianthus pranced down a shimmering pathway. He leapt over a stone wall and cantered over another field.

The unicorn’s horn glistened, and the snowy field reflected gold and copper light. Not until the unicorn came to the tree that held the tree house did he stop.

Annie hugged the unicorn’s long, graceful neck. “Thank you, thank you!” she whispered, and kissed him.

“Yeah, wow,” breathed Jack.

Annie looked at Jack over her shoulder. “What now?” she asked.

“I guess we climb off,” said Jack.

“But then what?” Annie asked sadly. “Where does he go?”

“That’s a good question,” said Jack.

“He comes with us, of course,” someone said.

Jack and Annie gasped.

Balor and Grinda slunk out from behind the tree. Balor carried the black rope.

Jack was stunned. “How—how did you get here so fast?” he asked.

“We took the A train,” said Balor. “’Tis actually a bit faster than riding a unicorn.” The boy laughed meanly.

“Shut up, Balor,” said Grinda. Then she turned to Jack and Annie. “I am glad you had a happy little ride. But you can say good-bye to Dianthus now. We will take him from here.”

“No, you won’t!” said Annie.

“Stay away from us!” said Jack.

“Come on, Dianthus, let’s go!” said Annie.

Before Dianthus could move, Grinda rushed forward and grabbed his collar with both hands. The unicorn snorted and shook his head. Grinda clung fiercely to the collar. “Get the rope over his head, Balor!” she yelled. “Now!”

Balor looped the black rope into a noose again. The unicorn twisted and turned his head.

Jack kicked at Balor. “Stop!” he yelled. “Get away from us!” Jack felt stupid just yelling and kicking, but he didn’t know what else to do.

As Balor and Grinda struggled to get the noose over the unicorn’s head, Annie pointed at them. In a loud voice, she shouted: Fowl of air, appear now here!

Aka-aka-aka-mere!

The black rope fell to the snow. Balor and Grinda started to spin around. They spun like two spinning tops. As they spun, they grew smaller and smaller. Jack saw a blur of colors: gray and brown, green and white, a dash of orange, a dash of yellow.

The spinning slowly came to a stop. The two scary teenagers were gone. In their place were two small mallard ducks.



9. It’s Them!




One duck was gray with black and white markings. The other had a glossy green head and a rust-colored chest. Both had orange webbed feet and long yellow bills. Quack, quack, they said.

Annie looked over her shoulder at Jack. “I memorized the duck rhyme a while ago,” she said with a grin. “I knew it would come in handy someday.”

Jack laughed. “Good work,” he said.

The two ducks waddled around on their bright orange feet, quacking. Answering cries came from overhead. A flock of ducks was flying through the clear November sky.

“Go on, Balor and Grinda!” Annie shouted to the two mallards. “Go with them now!”

The mallards quacked at Annie.

“Go on!” Jack chimed in. “Fly south for the winter! You’ll have fun! We promise!”

The two mallards quacked and flapped their wings. First one and then the other rose off the ground. They flew high into the sky. Jack held his breath as he watched the mallards soar away, flying south over New York City.

Annie put her arms around the unicorn’s neck. Then she rested her head on his silky white mane. “You’re safe now,” she said. “But you have to leave us. I have to show you the way to Camelot. The problem is, I don’t know how to do that.”

AH-U-GA! AH-U-GA!

Jack looked over at an avenue that bordered the park. A big yellow taxi was parked by the curb. The driver was honking his horn. He waved through the window.

“What’s that guy want?” said Annie, sitting up.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

The driver jumped out of the car. He wore a cap and a plaid scarf. “Hey, it’s the same driver who deserted us outside the Cloisters,” said Annie.

The passenger door of the taxi opened, and a girl stepped out. She was wearing a purple shawl. “And that’s the girl who told us to get off at the wrong subway stop,” said Jack.

The taxi driver and the girl in the shawl both waved at Jack and Annie. Then the driver lifted his cap and pulled down his scarf. He had red curly hair and a wonderfully familiar grin.

The girl pulled the shawl off her head. Beautiful long black curls fell down to her waist.

“It’s them!” said Jack.

“Teddy! Kathleen!” Annie shouted.

Jack and Annie slid off the unicorn’s back onto the snowy ground. The young enchanters ran across the snow to them. Annie threw her arms around Teddy. Kathleen threw her arms around Jack. The four of them laughed and talked at the same time.

“That was you!”

“That was you!”

“That was us!”

“I’m sorry I told you to get off at the wrong stop,” said Kathleen. “But Teddy was waiting for you there!”



“And I’m sorry I left you stranded in the storm,” said Teddy. “But I knew you’d find your way to the Cloisters!”

“We thought you guys were these two kids following us, Balor and Grinda!” said Annie.

“Yes, we just saw you turn them into ducks!” said Kathleen. “Brilliant!”

“Who were they?” asked Jack.

“Apprentices of the Dark Wizard,” said Kathleen. “We didn’t know they were following you! Even Merlin didn’t know.”

“They were pretty creepy,” said Jack.

“Yeah, but they actually helped us without meaning to,” said Annie. “They knew the unicorn’s name.”

“We thought it was Divine Flower of Rome,” said Jack.

“I told Merlin that clue might be a bit difficult,” said Teddy. “Divine Flower is dianthus in Latin, the language of old Rome.”

“So do Grinda and Balor know Latin?” asked Annie.

“Hardly,” said Teddy. “The unicorn’s name is famous throughout the Otherworld. He is known for his great magic.”

“And for his goodness,” added Kathleen.

“We know about his goodness,” said Annie. “When he ran through the streets with his horn in the air, the blizzard ended. And everyone we passed cheered up and seemed to get more hopeful.”

“The Dark Wizard was trying to capture Dianthus so he could keep the unicorn’s good magic from the rest of the world,” said Kathleen. “Merlin will be very pleased that you have foiled the wizard’s plan.”

“In truth, I believe he would like to thank you himself,” said Teddy. He turned toward the yellow taxi parked by the curb.

The back door of the car opened, and two grown-ups stepped out: a tall, elegant woman wearing a wine-colored cloak and a man in a dark blue robe. The man had a long white beard. The woman had long white hair.

“Morgan! Merlin!” whispered Jack.

As the wizard and magical librarian of Camelot walked across the snow, Dianthus stepped forward to greet them. He bowed his head. Merlin tenderly stroked the unicorn’s white neck.

Morgan le Fay turned to Jack and Annie. “Hello,” she said, smiling. “It is good to see you both.” Her lovely voice washed over Jack like music.

“You too,” said Annie, hugging the enchantress.

“What are you and Merlin doing here?” Jack asked.

“I have always wanted to visit New York City,” said Morgan. “Teddy has just given us quite a ride in that taxi. Merlin had to tell him to slow down several times.” Morgan laughed and turned toward Merlin.

“Quite a ride indeed,” said Merlin. “Greetings to you both, Jack and Annie.”

“Greetings,” they said.

“Thank you for saving my beloved Dianthus,” said Merlin. “Long ago, he was stolen from Camelot by evildoers. He was rescued by magic weavers in the Netherlands. To keep him safe, they used their art to hide him in their tapestries. I knew I could entrust you two to set him free on the day the spell was to end. But your mission turned out to be more dangerous than I intended. I did not know the Dark Wizard had sent his apprentices to follow you and capture the unicorn.”

“Poor Grinda and Balor,” said Annie. “Now they’re ducks.”

“Oh, do not worry,” said Teddy. “The spell will wear off in a few days, and they’ll find their way home.”

“Yes,” said Kathleen, “and I am sure the Dark Wizard will have some other wicked plan for them.”

“Aye,” said Merlin, “but they will no longer have the use of their black rope.” He picked the rope up from the ground and handed it to Teddy.

“Take this back to Camelot and see that it is destroyed.”

“Gladly,” said Teddy.

“It must be terrible to work for the Dark Wizard,” said Annie. She looked at Merlin. “I’m glad we work for you instead.”

Merlin smiled. “And so am I,” he said. “On your last four missions, you and Jack have proved you know how to use magic wisely. And for that, I now entrust you with one of Camelot’s greatest treasures.”



Merlin pulled a spiraled wand from his robe. “I give you the Wand of Dianthus,” he said. “As you can see, the wand is made in the shape of the unicorn’s horn. It has a bit of his magic in it.” Merlin held the silver wand out to Jack and Annie.

Jack took the wand from Merlin. It burned in his hand—with cold or warmth, he couldn’t tell which.

“With the help of the wand, you can make your own magic,” said Merlin.

“But you can only use it after you have tried your hardest,” said Morgan, “and remember that it can only be used for another’s good.”

“We’ll remember,” breathed Annie.

“Thank you,” said Jack. He unbuckled his briefcase and carefully placed the silver wand inside.

“We must leave you now,” said Merlin. He turned to Teddy and Kathleen. “You may ride Dianthus home to Camelot. I will be along shortly. But first, I would like to drive that taxi around New York City myself. Morgan, will you join me?”

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “But drive a bit more slowly than Teddy, please.”

“I promise nothing,” said Merlin. He looked at Jack and Annie. “Good evening to you, my friends. I will call for you again soon.”

“Bye,” said Annie and Jack.

Merlin took Morgan’s arm, and the two walked back to the taxi and climbed into the front seat. The big yellow car sputtered and then took off wildly. As it careened up the avenue, Merlin blew its horn.

AH-U-GA! AH-U-GA!



10. The Wand of Dianthus




Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Kathleen laughed.

“My,” said Kathleen. “I believe I would much rather ride Dianthus than go with Merlin!”

The white unicorn knelt in the snow. Kathleen and Teddy climbed onto his back. Dianthus stood up.

Teddy smiled down at Jack and Annie. “You know ’tis a very great honor to be given the Wand of Dianthus,” he said.

“I know,” said Jack shyly. “Thanks for getting us to the right place at the right time today.”

“Hey, were you guys in Venice, looking out for us there, too?” said Annie. “And Baghdad? And Paris?”

The two young enchanters looked at one another. Then they nodded their heads.

“We knew it!” said Annie. “Thanks for helping us!”

“And thanks for the book of magic rhymes,” said Jack.

“You are most welcome,” said Teddy. “And now we must go. We hope to see you again soon.”

“Good-bye, Dianthus,” said Annie. She stroked the unicorn’s neck one last time.

Dianthus lowered his head and stared at her with his soft blue eyes. They sparkled in the last bit of daylight. Annie stood on her toes and whispered in the unicorn’s ear. Then she stepped back.

Dianthus snorted. He raised his head. Then he leapt forward. In a flash of silver, the unicorn and his two riders were gone.

Standing in the cold dusk, Annie stared silently into the distance.

“What did you say to him?” asked Jack.

“I told him he had to go with Teddy and Kathleen,” Annie said. She blinked back tears. “I told him they would show him the way home now.”

“Oh,” said Jack. He put his hand on Annie’s back. “Don’t worry. We’ll see Dianthus again someday. I just feel it.”

Annie smiled. “You’re starting to sound like me,” she said.

“Uh-oh,” said Jack. He shivered. Night was falling fast. “Ready?”

“Sure, let’s go,” said Annie. She followed Jack to the tree house and up the rope ladder. They climbed inside and looked out the window.

The lights of New York City were starting to come on. A full moon was rising over the snow-covered park.

“Hello, blue moon,” said Jack.

“Good-bye, blue moon,” said Annie.

Jack picked up the scroll from Merlin. He pointed to the words Frog Creek in Merlin’s note. “I wish we could go home!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

* * *

A cold wind blew through the Frog Creek woods. A few fat snowflakes drifted into the tree house. Jack and Annie were dressed in their own clothes again. Jack’s briefcase had turned back into a backpack.

Jack quickly opened the pack and looked inside. “Good,” he said. “The Wand of Dianthus is still there.”

“Should we take it home with us?” asked Annie.

“I think so,” said Jack. “We can keep it safe until our next mission.” He pulled Teddy and Kathleen’s book of rhymes out of his pack.

“I guess we can keep our book of rhymes as a souvenir,” Jack said. “We won’t be using it anymore since we’ve used up all the rhymes.” He stuffed the book back into his backpack.

“We haven’t used all of them,” said Annie. “We still have one left, remember? Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose.”

“Oh, I already used that one,” said Jack. “Come on, let’s go.” He grabbed his pack and started down the rope ladder.

“What do you mean you already used that one?” Annie said as she followed him down. “When did you use that rhyme?”

Jack stepped onto the ground. “How do you think I found you when you got lost in Central Park?” he said.

“Wait, you thought I was a treasure?” said Annie.

Jack shrugged. “I guess,” he said. “At least today I did.”

Annie smiled. “Cool,” she said. “Thanks for finding me when you got lost.”

“Not me, you,” said Jack. “You’re the one who got lost.”

“No, you,” said Annie.

“You,” said Jack.

“Youyouyouyouyou!” said Annie.

Jack laughed. “Whatever,” he said. “Let’s go have some of Dad’s hot chocolate.”

The snow began to fall harder. As the cold wind rattled the bare trees of the Frog Creek woods, Jack and Annie hurried home.



More Facts for Jack and Annie and You!




The Great Depression: Today, older New Yorkers remember the Great Depression as one of the most difficult times in the city’s history. Lasting from 1929 to about 1939, the Depression was a time when all of America, as well as much of Europe, suffered terrible economic problems that caused many people to lose their jobs.

Subways: Today, millions of people ride the New York subways every day. There are over 400 miles of tracks. Riders no longer drop coins or tokens into a slot in the turnstiles, though. They now slide a MetroCard through an electronic card reader.

Central Park: Today, more than 250,000 people might visit Central Park on a warm weekend and picnic, jog, skate, bicycle, listen to music, or walk dogs. Designed over 150 years ago, Central Park was the first major park created entirely for public use. Its designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, believed that nature could lift the spirits of city dwellers and bring together people from all walks of life.

Belvedere Castle: Today, Belvedere Castle in Central Park serves as a nature observatory. If you live in New York City, you have often heard on TV or radio: “The temperature in Central Park is … “ That information is coming from the weather instruments that are still housed in the castle.

John D. Rockefeller: Today, America remembers John D. Rockefeller as once being the richest man in the country. After founding the Standard Oil Company, he focused on giving away half of his fortune. Through the generosity of his son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., a small museum in Fort Tryon Park in the northern part of the city was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. That museum is known as the Cloisters.

The Cloisters: Today, the Cloisters is filled with approximately 5,000 works of medieval art, including many works from Rockefeller’s own medieval art collection, such as the famous Unicorn Tapestries.

Unicorns: Today, unicorns appear in old stories from countries all over the world, most notably China, India, and medieval Europe. There is no proof that unicorns ever actually existed, though. The only land animal with a single horn is a rhinoceros.

I have illustrated all the Magic Tree House books, but illustrating Blizzard of the Blue Moon has been the most enjoyable so far.

My research for this project brought back many fond memories because as a student I often visited many of the places mentioned in the story, especially in Central Park, where I loved to sketch.

Since I still live close to New York City, I came to the city several times and followed the same route that Jack and Annie took from Central Park to the Cloisters.

Many of the places in the story are not very different than they were in 1938, and I was able to sketch and photograph them. The taxis and the subway trains have changed, but I was able to find pictures of these in books.

Tap, tap, tap.

Jack was dreaming that a white bird was pecking at his window. Tap … tap. A red bird appeared and pecked with the white bird. Tap … tap.

“Jack, wake up!” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

“They’re here!” said Annie.

“Who? The birds?” said Jack.

“No! Teddy and Kathleen!” Annie rushed to the window and waved outside. “They’re tossing pebbles at our windows.”

“Teddy and Kathleen!” Jack jumped out of bed and joined Annie at the window.

The two young enchanters of Camelot were standing in Jack and Annie’s front yard. They were dressed in long, dark cloaks. They smiled and waved up at Jack and Annie.

“Merlin must have sent them!” said Jack.

Teddy made a walking motion with his fingers and pointed toward the Frog Creek woods.

Annie nodded eagerly. “They want us to meet them at the tree house!” she said to Jack. “Hurry and get dressed! Before Mom and Dad wake up!”

Annie started out of Jack’s room. When she got to the door, she turned. “Oh, and don’t forget to bring the Wand of Dianthus!”

Jack threw on his clothes. He grabbed his backpack and peeked inside. The wand was there. Jack put his pack on his back. Then he slipped quietly downstairs and out the door.

Annie was standing on the front porch. “Let’s go!” she said.

Jack and Annie ran across their yard and dashed up the sidewalk.

“I wonder why they came for us!” said Annie.

“I wonder where we’re going!” said Jack.

“I wonder everything!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie crossed the street and hurried into the Frog Creek woods. The early-March trees looked weary from winter, gray and brown with no leaves on them yet.

“Look—” said Annie, out of breath. “They’re waiting for us!”

Jack looked up. Teddy and Kathleen were waving from the window of the magic tree house.

Jack grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Annie followed. When Jack and Annie climbed inside the tree house, they threw their arms around Teddy and Kathleen.

“We’re so glad to see you!” cried Annie.

“And we are happy to see you, also,” said Kathleen. The sea girl’s lovely water-blue eyes sparkled.

“Indeed,” said Teddy. “It has been too long.”

“What’s our mission this time?” asked Jack. “Where’s Merlin sending us?”

Teddy glanced at Kathleen. “I fear Merlin does not even know we are here,” said Teddy. “We have come not at his bidding, but for his sake.”

“What does that mean?” asked Jack.

“Merlin is not well,” said Kathleen. “He complains that he is getting old and feeble and that life is full of sorrows. He does not eat or sleep.”

“Oh, no!” said Annie.

“All of Camelot wishes to help him,” said Teddy. “But no one knows quite how.”

“What can we do to help?” asked Jack.

Teddy picked up a book from the corner of the tree house. “Throughout the ages, people all over the world have sought the secrets of happiness,” he said. “Morgan wants you to search for four of these secrets to share with Merlin. She believes that the first one might be found here.”

Jack took the book from Teddy. He read the title aloud.



“Oh, wow, we’ve been to Japan before!” said Annie.

“Before we met you,” Jack said to Teddy and Kathleen. “We had an adventure with ninjas.”

“Yes, Morgan told us,” said Teddy. “But she said that on that journey, you visited the countryside. This time you must travel to the capital city.”

“Are you guys coming with us?” asked Annie.

“I am afraid not,” said Kathleen. “We must return to Camelot now to help Morgan. Since Merlin has fallen ill, she has taken on much of his work.”

“You have the wand, do you not?” asked Teddy.

“Yep,” said Jack. He reached into his backpack and took out the Wand of Dianthus. The spiraled wand was shaped like a unicorn’s horn.

“With the help of the wand, you will make your own magic,” said Teddy.

“That’s what Merlin said when he gave it to us,” said Annie.

“But he didn’t say how,” said Jack.

“It is very simple,” said Teddy. “The wand has three rules. First, it only works for the good of others. The wand can never be used for selfish reasons.”

“Second, the wand works only after you have tried your very hardest without its help,” said Kathleen. “Do not attempt to use its magic too quickly.”

“And third, the wand only works with a command of five words,” said Teddy. “So you must choose your words carefully.”

“Can we review all that, please?” asked Jack.

“Don’t worry, I’ve got it,” said Annie. “We have to go. We have to help Merlin as soon as we can.”

“If the tree house takes us to Japan, how will you go back to Camelot?” Jack asked Teddy and Kathleen.

Teddy and Kathleen held up their hands. They each wore a sparkling blue ring. “Our magic rings will take us home,” said Kathleen.

“And this book from Camelot’s library will bring you back home to Frog Creek,” said Teddy, “after you have completed your mission.” He picked up another book lying in a corner. It was the book about Pennsylvania that Jack and Annie had used on their first magic tree house adventures.

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“Good-bye,” said Annie. “Take good care of Merlin.”



“We will try,” said Kathleen. She and Teddy raised their magic rings to their lips. They whispered words too softly for Jack and Annie to hear, then blew on the rings. As they blew, the young sorcerers began to fade into the cool morning air. In a moment, they had disappeared completely.

Silence filled the tree house.

Annie turned to Jack. “Ready?” she said.

Jack nodded. He pointed to the cover of the Japan book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Here’s what kids have to say to

Mary Pope Osborne, author of

the Magic Tree House series:

WOW! You have an imagination like no other.—Adam W.



I love your books. If you stop writing books, it will be like losing a best friend.—Ben M.



I think you are the real Morgan le Fay. There is always magic in your books.—Erica Y.



One day I was really bored and I didn’t want to read … I looked in your book. I read a sentence, and it was interesting. So I read some more, until the book was done. It was so good I read more and more. Then I had read all of your books, and now I hope you write lots more.—Danai K.



I always read [your books] over and over … 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times … —Yuan C.



You are my best author in the world. I love your books. I read all the time. I read everywhere. My mom is like freaking out.—Ellen C.



I hope you make these books for all yours and mine’s life.—Riki H.





Teachers and librarians love

Magic Tree House® books, too!

Thank you for opening faraway places and times to my class through your books. They have given me the chance to bring in additional books, materials, and videos to share with the class.—J. Cameron



It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books … I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year … WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home … I have since introduced this great series to my class. They have absolutely fallen in love with these books! … My students are now asking me for more independent reading time to read them. Your stories have inspired even my most struggling readers.—M. Payne



I love how I can go beyond the [Magic Tree House] books and use them as springboards for other learning.—R. Gale



We have enjoyed your books all year long. We check your Web site to find new information. We pull our map down to find the areas where the adventures take place. My class always chimes in at key parts of the story. It feels good to hear my students ask for a book and cheer when a new book comes out.—J. Korinek



Our students have “Magic Tree House fever.” I can’t keep your books on the library shelf.—J. Rafferty



Your books truly invite children into the pleasure of reading. Thanks for such terrific work.—S. Smith



The children in the fourth grade even hide the [Magic Tree House] books in the library so that they will be able to find them when they are ready to check them out.—K. Mortensen



My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





For many years, I have admired Japan’s literature and art. I collect books of Japanese poetry, and I also collect books of old Japanese prints that show people going about their everyday lives. Japanese art and poetry were my inspiration for writing this book, because I wanted to live in the scenes the artists and poets created. I wanted to ride on a fishing boat, sip tea in a teahouse, see cherry-blossom petals float down a river. When I’m writing a book, I feel as if I am living in another time and place. Working on this particular Magic Tree House adventure, I couldn’t wait to get to my writing desk every day … to visit the world of my dreams.

For Griffin Loehr van Rhyn,

a good friend of Jack and Annie’s



Now I shall dream,

Lulled by the patter of rain

And the song of the frogs.



—poem from old Japan,

translated by Lafcadio Hearn





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history: Venice, Baghdad, Paris, and New York City. After they proved to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he awarded them the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that will help them make their own magic. Jack and Annie are now waiting to hear from Merlin again….



1. For Merlin’s Sake

Tap, tap, tap.

Jack was dreaming that a white bird was pecking at his window. Tap … tap. A red bird appeared and pecked with the white bird. Tap … tap.

“Jack, wake up!” said Annie.

“Yes, Morgan told us,” said Teddy. “But she said that on that journey, you visited the countryside. This time you must travel to the capital city.”

“Are you guys coming with us?” asked Annie.

“I am afraid not,” said Kathleen. “We must return to Camelot now to help Morgan. Since Merlin has fallen ill, she has taken on much of his work.”

“You have the wand, do you not?” asked Teddy.

“Yep,” said Jack. He reached into his backpack and took out the Wand of Dianthus. The spiraled wand was shaped like a unicorn’s horn.

“With the help of the wand, you will make your own magic,” said Teddy.

“That’s what Merlin said when he gave it to us,” said Annie.

“But he didn’t say how,” said Jack.

“It is very simple,” said Teddy. “The wand has three rules. First, it only works for the good of others. The wand can never be used for selfish reasons.”

“Second, the wand works only after you have tried your very hardest without its help,” said Kathleen. “Do not attempt to use its magic too quickly.”

“And third, the wand only works with a command of five words,” said Teddy. “So you must choose your words carefully.”

“Can we review all that, please?” asked Jack.

“Don’t worry, I’ve got it,” said Annie. “We have to go. We have to help Merlin as soon as we can.”

“If the tree house takes us to Japan, how will you go back to Camelot?” Jack asked Teddy and Kathleen.

Teddy and Kathleen held up their hands. They each wore a sparkling blue ring. “Our magic rings will take us home,” said Kathleen.

“And this book from Camelot’s library will bring you back home to Frog Creek,” said Teddy, “after you have completed your mission.” He picked up another book lying in a corner. It was the book about Pennsylvania that Jack and Annie had used on their first magic tree house adventures.

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“Good-bye,” said Annie. “Take good care of Merlin.”





“We will try,” said Kathleen. She and Teddy raised their magic rings to their lips. They whispered words too softly for Jack and Annie to hear, then blew on the rings. As they blew, the young sorcerers began to fade into the cool morning air. In a moment, they had disappeared completely.

Silence filled the tree house.

Annie turned to Jack. “Ready?” she said.

Jack nodded. He pointed to the cover of the Japan book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. The Imperial Garden


Jack opened his eyes. Soft morning light shone across the floor of the tree house. Pink flowers bloomed on a branch outside the window.

Jack and Annie were wearing brown baggy pants and brown silk robes with blue sashes. On their feet were stiff white socks and straw sandals. Jack’s backpack had turned into a burlap bag.



“Are we wearing bathrobes?” asked Jack.

“I think they’re called kimonos,” said Annie.

“Oh, right,” said Jack. “Where’d we land exactly?” Jack and Annie looked out the window.

Below the tree house was a beautiful garden filled with cherry trees and long-leafed willows. A waterfall tumbled into a sparkling green pool.

“Wow,” said Annie.

Jack opened the Japan book and found a painting that looked like the garden. He read aloud to Annie:

In the 1600s, the Imperial Garden surrounded the Imperial Palace in the capital city of Japan. The city was called Edo (say EE-doh). In the mid-1800s, its name was changed to Tokyo (say TOH-kee-oh).



“Tokyo?” said Annie. “I’ve always wanted to go to Tokyo!”

“Me too,” said Jack. He read on:

The late 1600s in Japan were years of peace and prosperity. Art and culture thrived. But it was a time when the country was completely closed to the outside world. No one was allowed to come in. The citizens of Edo were frequently checked to make sure they had passports.



“What’s a passport exactly?” said Annie.

“It’s an official booklet that says who you are,” said Jack. “It also lists the different countries you traveled to.” He read more:

Anyone who did not have a passport was considered a spy and punished severely.



“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “We don’t have passports.”

“Yeah, that’s a problem,” said Jack.

“Hey! What if we use the Wand of Dianthus to make passports?” said Annie.

“Good idea!” said Jack. He peeked inside his bag. Good, the Wand of Dianthus was there.

“Wait, wait,” said Annie. “We can’t. Remember the rules. We can only use the magic wand for the good of others.”

“Oh, right,” said Jack.

“And we have to try our hardest before we use the wand,” said Annie.

“We haven’t tried anything yet,” said Jack.

“I guess we should just start looking for a secret of happiness and hope no one catches us,” said Annie.

“Shh,” said Jack, “listen.”

A bell was ringing in the distance. The ringing grew louder. Then came the sound of horses. Jack and Annie crouched down. They raised their heads just high enough to peek out the window. Through the flowery tree branches, they saw a small procession coming through the garden.

The man leading the procession was ringing a bell. Two men walked behind him, holding up banners. Behind them, four men rode slowly on horseback. They all wore baggy trousers and puffy shirts. Their heads were shaved, except for knots of black hair. Each had two swords—a long one and a short one—hanging from his belt.

At the very end of the procession rode a man in a billowing purple robe and a small purple hat. Red tassels hung from the bridle of his large black horse.

Jack looked at their research book again. He found a picture that looked like the man on the black horse. He read the caption to himself:

In the 1600s, the military ruler known as the shogun (say SHOW-gun) lived in the center of the Imperial Garden in a palace that had hundreds of rooms.





“That last guy is a shogun,” Jack whispered to Annie. “He lives in a big palace in the garden.” He kept reading:

Often the shogun’s warriors traveled with him. They were called samurai (say SAM-uh-rye).



“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “Those other guys are samurai!” He and Annie had barely escaped an armored samurai on their earlier trip to Japan.

Samurai were excellent horsemen well trained in the arts of fighting. The code of the samurai was strict. Samurai did not show their feelings. They had great powers of concentration.



“They’re gone,” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. The shogun and his samurai warriors had disappeared down a tree-shaded dirt road.

“We should get out of the Imperial Garden fast,” said Jack. “If we stay here, we’re just asking to be caught.”

“How do we get out?” asked Annie.

Jack looked in the Japan book. He found a map of Edo. “Look,” he said, pointing at the map. “We have to get over this bridge that leads away from the Imperial Garden into the city. The bridge is on the east side of the garden.”

“The morning sun is over there,” said Annie, squinting into the sunlight. “So that must be east. Let’s climb down and head that way.”

“Good plan. Then we’ll be walking in the opposite direction of those samurai,” said Jack.

“Right,” said Annie. She started down the rope ladder.

“Be careful,” said Jack. “We don’t want anyone to see us sneaking around the Imperial Garden.”

Jack put the Japan book into his burlap bag and slung the bag over his shoulder. As he stepped onto the ladder, he nearly tripped on his kimono. “Oh, brother,” he said. He held up the cloth and carefully climbed down.

Jack joined Annie on a wide path. A gust of dry wind carried petals from cherry trees through the air. The long branches of the willows swayed over the grass.

Jack and Annie began heading east, keeping their eyes and ears open for more people. They walked past flower beds and big rocks. They walked around a pond with swans. They started down a narrow lane between blossoming cherry trees.

Just as they came out from under the trees, Jack and Annie saw four men strolling toward them. One man was shorter and older than the others. He wore a straw hat and a tattered brown coat and used a walking stick. The other three had shaved heads with topknots, and two swords hung from each of their belts.

“Samurai!” whispered Jack.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

“Run!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie turned around and started running back down the narrow lane.

Jack heard the men running after them. “Halt!” cried a samurai.

Jack grabbed Annie’s hand and they stumbled to a halt. Out of breath, they turned to face the three samurai who were rushing toward them.

“Who are you?” one of the samurai barked. He was holding up his sword. “Why do you run from us? Are you spies?”

Just as Jack was about to answer, he heard a voice shout, “Baku! Koto!”

The man with the walking stick and straw hat was hurrying toward them. “Baku, Koto, what are you doing here?” he called out to Jack and Annie. “Why did you not wait for me at the bridge?”


3. Basho


The three samurai turned to the man with the walking stick. “You know them, Master?” one asked.

“Yes, of course,” the man said. “This boy and girl are Baku and Koto, my best students.”

“Hi, Master!” said Annie, pretending she knew who the man was. “We couldn’t find the bridge, so we—uh—we—”

“We came here to look for you,” said Jack.

“And now you have found me,” said the man. “I am sorry you were frightened by my friends.”

The samurai put away his sword. “Forgive me,” he said, bowing before Jack and Annie.



“Sure, no problem,” said Annie.

The samurai turned to the small man. “We will leave you with your students now,” he said. “Thank you, Most Honored Master, for your visit with us today.” All three warriors bowed deeply before the man. Then they walked away.

Why did the samurai call the small man “Most Honored Master”? Jack wondered.

When the samurai were gone, the man turned to Jack and Annie. His eyes twinkled. “I believe you are safe now,” he said.

“Thanks,” said Annie. “But I’m afraid we’re not Baku and Koto.”

“No, you are not,” said the man. “But you are not spies, either, are you?”

“No,” said Jack.

“I did not think so,” said the man. “That is why I thought you needed my help.”

“Thank you,” said Jack.

“You are most welcome,” said the man. “Now perhaps you will tell me who you really are, and how you came to be here in the Imperial Garden.”

“Our names are Jack and Annie,” said Jack. “And we—” He paused. It seemed impossible to explain: Teddy and Kathleen’s visit, Merlin’s sorrow, Morgan’s research book.

“We came here to search for a secret of happiness,” said Annie.

The man smiled. “I believe that is something we all seek,” he said. “But you must be very careful, Jack and Annie. The shogun does not allow foreigners into our country. If you do not have passports, you could be caught and punished.”

“We know,” said Annie. “What should we do?”

“Perhaps you should travel with me today,” said the man. “You can continue to be my students, Baku and Koto.”

“Good plan!” said Jack.

“You must remember, seek harmony with your surroundings,” said the man. “Observe the people of Edo and do as they do. If you do not stand out, you will not be noticed by the samurai.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

Seek harmony with your surroundings. Observe the people of Edo and do as they do, Jack repeated to himself.

“Come,” said the man. He started walking briskly through the garden.

Jack and Annie hurried after him. “Excuse me, but what’s your name?” Annie said.

“My friends call me Basho,” the man answered.

“Basho? That’s a cute name!” said Annie.

“And why did the samurai call you ‘Most Honored Master’?” asked Jack.

“Because I am their teacher,” said Basho.

“What do you teach them?” asked Jack.

Basho smiled. “Today they learned how to listen to a cricket in a woodpile,” he said, “and how to think like a frog.”

“Cool,” said Jack. Those must be warrior skills, he thought, special ways to listen for an enemy or jump around with a sword. He remembered how ninjas used secrets of nature to fight their enemies.

Basho led Jack and Annie through a wooden gate in a high wall. They walked over a wide stone bridge that crossed a moat. When they came to the other side of the bridge, they followed a path that led to a small boat dock on a river.

Three fishermen were loading wicker baskets into a long flat-bottomed boat. Hundreds of shiny little fish were inside each basket.

Basho walked over to the fishermen. “Good morning,” he said.

“Good morning, Master Basho,” the fishermen said. All of them bowed.

Everyone seems to know Basho, Jack thought.

“May my students and I ride with you down the river?” asked Basho.

“Oh, yes, of course, Master Basho!” one of the men said. “We would be most honored to carry you in our humble boat!”

“Thank you,” said Basho.

Jack and Annie followed Basho onto the deck of the boat and sat next to the wicker baskets.



One of the fishermen untied the boat, and the others used long poles to push it away from the dock. The men began poling down the river.

The fishing boat floated under a series of bridges, moving in and out of shadows and glittering light. As it passed under one of the bridges, it scraped the bottom of the river. Basho, Jack, and Annie were thrown forward.

“Forgive us, Master!” one of the fishermen called to Basho. “The river is very shallow.”

“There has been no rain for a long time,” said another fisherman. “It is very worrisome to us.”

“Yes, it worries me, too,” said Basho.

“What’s everyone so worried about?” Annie asked Basho.

“When the weather is very dry, the people of Edo worry about fire,” said Basho. “Twenty-five years ago, during a dry spell, half our city was destroyed by a terrible fire. Thousands died.”

“Oh, that’s awful!” said Annie.

“Yes. Since then, everyone has worked hard to rebuild the capital,” said Basho. “Edo is now even more beautiful than before. In fact, along this riverbank are many new castles of the samurai. See? There one hides now.”

Basho pointed at a steep rocky cliff above the riverbank. Jack shaded his eyes as he looked at the curved roof and high stone walls of a samurai castle. “Its largest room is called the Thousand-Mat Hall,” said Basho.

“What does that mean?” asked Jack.

“It means the room can hold a thousand floor mats,” said Basho.

“Cool,” said Annie. “Basho, where do you live?”

Basho smiled. “My castle is on the other side of the Great Bridge,” he said.

Jack wondered how many mats Basho’s castle could hold.

Beyond the steep cliffs, the boat traffic grew heavier. Now there were many boats floating on the wide river: big sailboats, barges loaded with lumber, and ferries filled with passengers holding parasols.

The fishing boat glided toward a crowded dock next to a market. In the market, thousands of gleaming fish were laid out on tables. Men and women also sold fish and other sea creatures from baskets that hung from poles across their shoulders. “Shrimp!” “Tuna!” “Octopus!” “Eel!” they shouted.

“Wait for us while we deliver the fish,” Basho said to Jack and Annie. “Then we will travel further on the river.”

The fishermen tied up the boat. Jack and Annie waited on the landing as Basho helped the crew unload the wicker baskets. Then each man put a basket on his head and started up the stone steps that led to the fish market.

“Oh, no!” said Annie. “Look!” She pointed toward the other end of the dock.

Jack looked. He saw several samurai getting off a boat. “Quick! Grab a basket!” he said.

Jack and Annie each picked up a basket of fish. As Jack tried to lift the basket to his head, he tilted it. A couple of fish hit him on the nose as they fell to the dock.

“Leave them! Come on!” whispered Annie.

Carrying the baskets on their heads, Jack and Annie followed Basho and the fishermen up the steps and delivered their fish to a young woman at one of the tables. Jack glanced back at the river. The samurai were standing on the landing, checking someone’s passport.

Jack looked at Basho. Basho was watching the samurai, too. He turned to the fishermen. “Thank you for the ride,” he said calmly, bowing to the men. “We will walk from here.”

The fishermen nodded and smiled.

Good plan, Jack thought, relieved.

“Come,” said Basho. He led Jack and Annie away from the market. Soon they came to a busy road crowded with pedestrians and travelers on horseback.

As they walked along with the crowd, Jack remembered Basho’s words: “Seek harmony with your surroundings.” He tried to blend in by walking at a steady pace. Keeping his eyes down, he worried about their mission. How will we ever find the secret of happiness, he wondered, if we have to keep dodging the samurai?

“Look at that bridge!” said Annie.

Jack glanced up. A high, arched bridge spanned the river. Hundreds of people were walking across it.

“That is the Great Bridge,” said Basho. “It will lead us away from the heart of Edo to the bank of the Sumida River, where I live.”

“Great,” said Jack. He hoped they would be safer away from the heart of Edo. Then maybe they could focus on their search for the secret.

Jack, Annie, and Basho joined the crowd crossing the bridge. They walked single file, close to the wooden railing. Jack stared straight ahead, careful not to look anyone in the eye. He saw people having picnics on the other side of the bridge. Kids were flying red kites.

“What’s that mountain?” said Annie. She pointed to a snowcapped mountain looming in the distance. The white cone of the gray mountain rose above fleecy, rose-tinted clouds.

“That is a volcanic mountain called Mount Fuji,” said Basho.





“Oh, I’ve heard of Mount Fuji!” said Jack. “That’s the highest mountain in Japan, right?”

“Yes, and the most beautiful,” said Basho.

“It is beautiful,” said Annie.

Jack looked around. Actually, he thought everything seemed beautiful at that moment: the green and yellow parasols of the ferryboat passengers below, the pink cherry trees shimmering at the river’s edge, the red kites and white seagulls gliding through the sky.

“I love Japan,” Jack said softly.

“I do, too,” said Basho. “We call our world ‘the floating world,’ for it seems to float on beauty.”

“It really does,” murmured Jack. Walking across the Great Bridge, he felt as if he himself were floating through the floating world.



4. Sushi and Sumo

Basho led Jack and Annie off the Great Bridge and down a crowded road. They passed huge stacks of lumber. Then they came to a row of stages built along the riverbank. On one stage women were dancing. Their faces were painted white. They wore shimmering kimonos and waved fans.

Musicians played on a second stage. They plucked three-stringed instruments and blew on bamboo flutes. Their music was high-pitched and strange, but Jack liked it.

On another stage was a puppet show. Puppeteers wearing black clothes moved a giant dragon puppet around the stage. A man stood to the side and told a story to the audience. From the back of the crowd, it was hard to hear him.

“What’s he saying?” said Annie.

“He is telling the legend of the Cloud Dragon,” said Basho. “The Cloud Dragon is one of the guardian animals of the four directions. She has the power of flight and commands the rain clouds.”

“Cool,” said Annie.



Basho led them on past rows of stalls where craftspeople sold beads, cloth, kites, and paper lanterns. Some boys were holding up yo-yos for sale. Jack was surprised to see yo-yos in old Japan.

Beyond the craft stalls was a row of inns and cafés. The smell of spices and grilled fish filled the air.

“Yum,” said Annie.

Jack was hungry, too.

“Would you like to stop at a teahouse?” Basho asked them.

“Yes!” Jack and Annie said together.

Basho led them toward a small building with an open front. At the entrance, Basho slipped off his sandals. Jack and Annie did the same. They placed their sandals in a row of shoes that other people had left by the door.

Inside the teahouse, cooks stirred steaming pots over a wood-burning stove. People sat at long low tables, eating with chopsticks and drinking from small cups. Several customers smiled shyly and bowed before Basho.

Basho must be a really famous teacher of the samurai, thought Jack. It made Jack feel important to be with him.

Basho led them to a table and sat cross-legged on a straw mat. Jack and Annie did the same. A waiter with a kerchief around his head hurried to the table. “Welcome to our humble teahouse, Master Basho!” he said.

“Thank you,” said Basho.

Everyone is so polite in Japan! Jack thought.

The waiter handed Jack, Annie, and Basho warm wet towels. “Thank you,” said Jack and Annie.

Jack watched Basho wipe his hands on the towel. He and Annie did the same. Then they all gave their towels back to the waiter.

“I would like plates of sushi for me and my two students, please,” said Basho.

“Thank you,” said the waiter, bowing.

While they waited for their food, Jack studied the people in the room. Jack noticed that even little kids were eating with chopsticks. He and Annie had never had much luck using chopsticks in Asian restaurants back home.

Soon the waiter brought over three plates of small cakes of sticky rice wrapped in dark green, paper-like strips. He also brought napkins and three pairs of chopsticks.

When the waiter had gone, Basho spoke to Jack and Annie in a soft voice so no one else could hear. “We call this sushi,” he said. “It is rice with pieces of raw fish in the middle.”

“Raw fish?” said Jack. He gulped.

“And what’s this part?” Annie pointed at the papery wrapping.

“Seaweed,” said Basho.

“Seaweed?” said Jack.

“It is very good,” said Basho.

Jack was so hungry he was willing to try anything, even raw fish and seaweed. His only problem was the chopsticks.

“Try it this way, Jack,” said Annie. She carefully picked up a piece of sushi between the wooden ends of her chopsticks. Jack copied her. But as they both tried to bring their food to their mouths, their pieces of sushi fell onto the table.



Jack and Annie laughed and tried a second time. Annie was successful. But Jack dropped his sushi again. Without thinking, he grabbed it with his fingers and popped it into his mouth.

“Mmm!” said Jack. The vinegar-tasting rice, the raw fish, and the green, salty seaweed were delicious!

But Jack stopped in mid-chew. Two samurai at another table were glaring at him. One of the men had a big scar on his face. The other had fierce dark eyes.

Jack’s throat was dry as he swallowed. They saw me mess up with my chopsticks! he thought. They can tell I’m not from Japan! He picked up another piece of sushi with his chopsticks. He glanced again at the samurai. They were watching him like hawks.

Jack’s hand felt shaky. He tried to stay calm. He remembered a passage from their research book: Samurai did not show their feelings. They had great powers of concentration.

Jack tried very hard not to show his fear. He concentrated on holding the sushi with his chopsticks. He raised the sushi to his mouth and ate it calmly. He lowered his chopsticks and picked up another piece of sushi. He ate it calmly.

When Jack looked back at the samurai, they were no longer watching him. Jack let out his breath. He picked up his last piece of sushi with his chopsticks and ate it calmly.

“Very good,” said Basho, smiling at him.

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“Let us go now,” said Basho.

Basho folded his napkin neatly and left it beside his plate. Jack and Annie did the same. Basho paid for their meals, and then they stopped at the entranceway to put on their shoes. As they stepped outside, a drum began beating loudly. A huge crowd had gathered on the grassy riverbank.

“What’s happening?” Annie asked.

“Come, I will show you,” said Basho.

People moved aside so Basho could lead Jack and Annie to the front of the crowd.

A large ring had been marked off on the ground with straw. In the middle of the circle, two enormously fat men squatted at opposite sides of the ring. Each man looked as if he weighed more than four hundred pounds. They clapped their hands. Then each began stomping his feet.



“Who are they?” said Annie, her eyes wide.

“Sumo wrestlers,” said Basho. “Sumo wrestling has been our most popular sport for over a thousand years.”

The two wrestlers were now perfectly still. Crouching down with clenched fists, they were glaring at one another. The whole crowd seemed to hold its breath as the wrestlers stared into each other’s eyes. Suddenly one wrestler lunged forward and grabbed the other. Then the hugely fat men began pushing each other around.

“They are trying to force each other out of the ring,” said Basho.

Grunting and groaning, the two men moved backward and forward as spectators cheered wildly. Then one wrestler made a quick move and shoved his rival out of the circle. The crowd roared. Jack found himself cheering, too.

When the noise died down, Basho turned to Jack and Annie. “The first match is over,” he said. “Shall we go now?”

Before Jack and Annie could answer him, two samurai stepped in front of them. One had a big scar on his face. The other had fierce dark eyes.

“Excuse me,” the scar-faced man said. “May we see your passports, please?”


5. An Excellent Student?


Jack froze.

Basho stepped forward. When the two samurai saw him, they bowed. “Good afternoon, Master,” one said.

“Good afternoon,” said Basho. “These are my students, Koto and Baku. I am afraid they left their passports at home today.”

“They are your students?” said the samurai with the scar.

“Yes, excellent students,” said Basho. “They have much natural talent.”

“Ah.” The two samurai looked at Jack and Annie with interest. “Will you share your talent with us?” one asked, smiling.

What talent? Jack wondered frantically. Some samurai-warrior talent?

Basho saw Jack’s confusion. “Perhaps you would each recite one of your poems,” he said.

“One of our poems?” squeaked Jack. What kind of samurai talent is that? he wondered. Do samurai warriors have to know poems?

“Sure,” said Annie. “Here’s a poem.” She took a deep breath and then recited:

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

How I wonder what you are.

Up above the world so high,

Like a diamond in the sky.



The samurai with the scar nodded. “Very good, Koto,” he said. “The little star twinkles like a diamond.”

The other samurai closed his eyes as if he were seeing the star. “Yes, yes, very good!” he said. “A sparkling diamond high above the world! Excellent.”

Both samurai then turned to Jack. “And you, Baku?” one said.



Jack stared at them. He couldn’t remember any poem—not even a nursery rhyme!

“Uh … a poem? Right,” said Jack. “Um. Let’s see…. Okay.” He took a deep breath and said:

I love Japan.

Oh, man.

I really love Japan.

The land of Japan

Is cool.



Jack bit his lip. He knew his poem was bad. He glanced at Annie. She looked as if she were trying not to laugh.

The dark-eyed samurai turned to Basho. “An excellent student?” he said.

Basho nodded. “Well, yes…. Baku has a—a special talent. He needs work, but the talent is there.”

The samurai frowned. “You say he left his passport at home, Master Basho? Where is his home?”

Just then the drumbeat started again. The samurai turned to look. A new sumo match was beginning. The two samurai moved closer to the ring to get a better look.

Basho turned to Jack and Annie. “We should leave now,” he said calmly. “I will take you to my home, where you will be safe.”

Jack, Annie, and Basho quickly left the sumo crowd and blended in with shoppers walking down a busy street. Peddlers carried long poles over their shoulders with baskets swinging on the ends. They shouted about their wares: “Shoes and socks!” “Cakes and pastries!” “Rope and twine!”

One woman had a large box strapped to her back. “Books! Books!” she shouted.

“No thank you,” said Jack. He loved books, but he kept going. He was afraid the samurai might show up again at any moment.

A boy carried birdcages and shouted, “Birds! Birds!”

Suddenly Jack felt a hand on his shoulder. He nearly had a heart attack! But it was just Basho. “I live that way,” said Basho, pointing. “Over the bridge.”

Jack and Annie walked with Basho over a small, narrow bridge that crossed a canal.

Basho led them past a temple, then past small bamboo houses with chickens in their yards. Little children were spinning tops on the dusty ground. One called out, “Hello, Master Basho!” Basho smiled and waved.

Then Jack and Annie walked with Basho along the dirt path bordering the river. Tall pine trees lined the riverbank. A dry wind blew leaves and pine needles into the shallows. Jack started to breathe more easily. He felt safer now.

The trail grew more narrow. The sun slipped behind the tops of the trees. Jack was eager to get to Basho’s castle. He looked for a steep roof and high stone walls like the castles of the samurai.

Through the deepening shadows of twilight, Basho led them to a clearing not far from the river.

At the center of the clearing was a pond overgrown with weeds. On the far side of the pond, moss-covered stones led to the door of a tiny hut. The hut was made of bamboo and had a roof of wood shingles. Next to the small hut was a large plant with droopy green leaves.

“Welcome to my castle,” said Basho.



6. The Banana Tree

“This is your castle?” said Jack.

Basho smiled. “In my heart, my humble cottage is grander than all the castles of the samurai,” he explained. “And my banana tree is more beautiful to me than all the beauty of the Imperial Garden.”

Jack and Annie stared at the large plant with the long, droopy leaves.

“I like this tree so much I have taken my name from it,” said Basho. “Basho means ‘banana tree.’”

“Cool,” said Annie. She looked around. “It’s nice here.”

Not really, thought Jack. The cottage was shabby and the droopy banana tree looked scrawny and sad to him.



“Please come inside,” said Basho. He slipped off his sandals and left them outside. He picked up a bundle of wood, then ducked through the low door that led into his hut.

Jack and Annie took off their shoes, too, and followed Basho into a small, shadowy room.

Basho opened his shutters to let in the evening air. “Please sit,” he said.

“Thank you,” said Jack and Annie. Jack looked around the room for chairs, but there weren’t any. The only furniture was a low wooden table and a bamboo chest. Three straw mats covered the earthen floor. Jack and Annie sat down on one of the mats.

Basho lit a small oil lamp. Then he made a fire in his fireplace. “I will prepare tea for us,” he said. “Rest while I draw water from the river.” He picked up one of the two wooden buckets near the door and headed outside.

When Basho was gone, Jack and Annie looked at each other. “I guess this is a three-mat house,” said Annie.

Jack nodded. “You’d think a famous teacher of the samurai would have a hundred-mat house … or at least a fifty-mat house,” he said.

“I like this house, though,” said Annie. “It’s cozy.”

“I wonder who Basho is exactly,” said Jack.

“If he’s famous, maybe he’s in our book,” said Annie. “Look him up.”

“Good idea,” said Jack. He pulled the research book out of his bag. By the light of the crackling fire, he looked up Basho in the index. “He is here!” Jack turned to the right page and read aloud.

Basho is one of Japan’s greatest poets.

He wrote short, beautiful poems that

speak to people as clearly today as they

did during the Edo period of Japan.



“Basho’s a great poet!” said Annie. “That explains everything!”

“Sort of …,” said Jack. “It explains why we had to recite poems to the samurai. But it doesn’t explain why Basho lives in such a dinky house.”

Basho opened the door and came in with his bucket. Jack closed the book and slipped it back into his bag.

Basho poured river water into an iron pot over the fire. He pulled three tiny bowls and a small cloth bag from the bamboo chest. He took loose green tea from the bag and dropped it into the bowls. Then he waited patiently for the water to boil.

Jack and Annie waited patiently, too. Listening to the soft rushing sounds of the river outside, Jack started to feel peaceful for the first time all day.

When the water was hot, Basho poured some into each of the tea bowls. Then he handed the warm bowls to Annie and Jack.

“Thank you,” said Annie.

“Thank you,” said Jack.

“You are welcome,” said Basho.

Jack carefully took a sip from the steaming bowl. The green tea tasted bitter, but he didn’t mind it.

“Hmm, interesting taste,” said Annie. “Basho, Jack was wondering, if you’re a famous poet, why do you live in such a dinky house?”

“Annie!” said Jack, embarrassed. “She’s kidding. I wasn’t really wondering that.”

Basho laughed. “Long ago, I trained to be a samurai,” he said. “But I was not happy. All I wanted to do was write poetry. A poet does not need to live in a castle. A poet needs to live with the wind and the clouds, the flowers and the birds. Here, I have a small garden and my banana tree. I have the sound of the river all day long. Here, I have everything I need to write my poems.”

“What do you write about?” asked Annie.

“Small things,” said Basho. “A crow picking snails out of the mud, a woodpecker hammering a tree, pine needles scattered by the wind. A poet finds beauty in all the small things of nature.”

“And you teach poetry to the samurai?” asked Jack.

“Yes, the samurai greatly honor the art of poetry,” said Basho. “Poetry helps focus the mind. The samurai believe a truly brave warrior should be able to compose a poem even in the midst of an earthquake, or while facing an enemy on the battlefield.”

“Can you say one of your poems for us?” asked Annie.

“Let me think,” said Basho. “Well … I was working on a new poem yesterday.” He reached for a wooden box under the table. He took a small piece of delicate paper from the box and read aloud:

An old pond:

a frog jumps in—

the sound of water.



Basho looked up at Jack and Annie.

“Hmm,” said Jack. “Nice beginning.”

“It is not just the beginning,” said Basho. “It is the whole poem. A small moment in time.”

“I think it’s great,” said Annie. “I love frogs. Your poem makes me love them even more.”

“Would you read it again, please?” Jack said. He felt like he must have missed something.

Basho read again:

An old pond:

a frog jumps in—

the sound of water.



Jack nodded thoughtfully. “Good,” he said. “It’s really good.” And he meant it. The poem made him feel as if he himself had been right there, by that pond, hearing the frog splash into the water, breaking the silence.

“If you like it, you may have it,” said Basho. He handed the paper to Jack.

“Thanks!” said Jack. As he put the poem in his bag, a bell rang softly in the distance.

“Ah, the temple bells,” said Basho. He stood up. “It is time to rest. I will take a mat and sleep outside. I enjoy sleeping under the stars. And now, because of the poem you recited today, Annie, I shall think of them as diamonds in the sky.”

Annie smiled.

“You can stay inside and cover yourselves with these mosquito nets,” said Basho. He pulled some nets from the bamboo chest and handed them to Jack and Annie. “But do not worry, in my small house there are only small mosquitoes— not giant ones like those in the Imperial Palace.”

Jack and Annie laughed at Basho’s joke. He gave a net to each of them. Then he picked up one of the mats from the floor and pulled it outside, closing the door behind him.

The fire in the fireplace had died down. The light from the oil lamp had nearly gone out, too. Jack and Annie lay on the straw mats and covered themselves with the mosquito nets. A cricket chirped on the hearth. Jack noticed a patch of light on the floor. He realized it was moonlight coming through the open window.





Jack reached out from under the net and put his hand on the square of pale moonlight. He could hear the rustling of the banana plant in the breeze. Half asleep, he imagined himself swaying with its long, broad leaves.

“This dinky hut is much nicer than a castle,” Annie murmured. “I feel like we’re tiny crickets going to sleep.”

“Yeah … I feel like I’m holding moonlight in my hand,” said Jack, “and like I’m a banana leaf… dancing in the wind.”

“Sounds like a poem,” said Annie.

“Yeah … maybe I should write it down …,” said Jack. But instead, he fell fast asleep.




7. Clang, Clang, Clang!

Clang, clang, clang!

Jack opened his eyes. The sound of bells filled the night—not the gentle ringing of the temple bells but a harsh clanging.

Jack smelled smoke. He and Annie threw off their mosquito nets and stumbled to the door.

Basho was standing in his yard, looking at the dawn sky. It was black with smoke. The bells kept clanging.

“Is there a fire?” asked Jack.

“Yes,” said Basho. “It must be very big, for the bells do not stop ringing from the watch-tower. This is what we have feared most. I must go and help the firefighters.”

“We’ll help, too,” said Jack.

“No, stay here,” said Basho. He pulled on his socks and sandals, then grabbed a wooden bucket by the door. “If the fire gets close, wade into the river, where you will be safe.”

“But we want to help!” said Annie.

“Yes, wait for us!” said Jack. He and Annie pulled on their socks and sandals.

“Come, then,” said Basho. “But if the fire begins to spread, you must promise to return here to the river.”

“We promise!” said Annie.

“Then bring the other bucket and follow me,” said Basho.

“I’ll get it,” said Jack. He hurried into the hut and grabbed the wooden bucket by the hearth. It was heavy, even without water in it. Jack hugged the bucket to his chest and rushed back outside.

Jack and Annie followed Basho through the pine forest. They passed a farmhouse where two small children stood outside, looking at the fiery sky.

“Our father says the lumberyard near the river is burning!” the boy shouted to Basho.

“He has gone to help fight the fire!” said the girl. “Great piles of wood are burning!”

The fire bells kept clanging as Basho, Jack, and Annie rushed past the temple and across the narrow footbridge.

They hurried up the winding dirt path until they came to the shopping market. In the smoky red dawn, people were pushing carts piled high with goods. They were running away from the fire.

But Basho, Jack, and Annie ran toward the fire. The air grew hotter and smokier near the teahouses and the performance stages. Sparks flew through the sky. Tiles on rooftops were catching fire and crashing to the ground.

Basho led Jack and Annie farther through the smoke until they came to the lumberyard. The fire roared as it burned piles of logs. Flames rose high into the sky.

Firefighters were passing buckets of water up a line from the river to the fire. Others waved huge fans to beat back the windblown flames, while the most daring worked with hooks and axes, trying to separate the burning timber.



“Help the bucket brigade!” Basho said to Jack and Annie. “Get water from the river!”

Basho rushed to help the men beating back the fire with fans while Jack and Annie hurried down to the river. Jack filled their wooden bucket. With water inside, it was so heavy he couldn’t lift it.

“Do it together!” said Annie.

“Right!” said Jack.

Using all their strength, Jack and Annie carried their bucket up the bank of the river. As they stumbled along, they tried not to spill the water. Jack could hardly breathe in the smoke-filled air. His throat and eyes burned. His face felt red-hot. Finally, when he thought he couldn’t take another step, they got to the bucket brigade. They gave their bucket to the person at the end, who gave them an empty bucket. “Get more!” he said.

Jack and Annie hurried back to the river with the empty bucket. They filled it with water and then struggled back up the bank.

Over and over, Jack and Annie hauled buckets of water back and forth from the river to the line of firefighters. Everyone worked hard to battle the great blaze. But the flames kept shooting into the sky. Eventually the fire leapt over the river, and timber on the far bank began to burn.

“Oh, no!” cried a woman. “All of Edo will catch fire now!”

“The rice-storage houses will burn down!” said a man. “The harvest will be destroyed!”

Several people began weeping. Jack felt like crying, too. Right in front of his eyes, the beautiful floating world of Edo was about to go up in flames. “This is hopeless!” he said to Annie.

“No, it’s not!” Annie said. “The wand! We can use the wand!”

“Of course!” cried Jack. “But it’s in my bag! Back at Basho’s house!”

“We have to get it!” said Annie. She shouted to Basho, “Basho, we’re going back to your castle!”

“Yes, run for safety!” called Basho. “Jump into the river!”

“Right!” cried Jack.

“Be careful!” Annie shouted to Basho. Then she and Jack started running as fast as they could. They raced past the market. They ran across the footbridge, past the temple and the farmhouse, and through the grove of pines to Basho’s house.

Jack and Annie ran inside the tiny hut. Jack grabbed his bag and pulled out the wand. He waved it through the air. “Do something to make the fire stop!” he shouted.

Jack held his breath and waited.

“Let me try!” said Annie. She took the wand and waved it. “Stop the fire over Edo now!” she shouted.

Jack and Annie waited again.

“It’s not working!” cried Jack. “We must be doing something wrong.”

“But this is for the good of everyone!” said Annie.

“I know, I know!” said Jack.

“And we’ve tried our hardest!” said Annie. “Everybody has!”

“Five words!” said Jack. “We have to use five words!”

“Oh, right!” said Annie. She waved the wand through the air again. “Put. Out. The. Fire!” she yelled.



“One more word!” cried Jack.

“Please!” shouted Annie.

Jack and Annie were blasted by a blinding light. Jack felt himself shooting through brightness, then darkness, then back into light. An icy wind blew. The air was crystal-clear. Early sunlight flashed on rock.

Jack and Annie were standing on the ledge of a mountain.


8. In the Red Dawn


“Are you—are you okay?” Annie asked Jack. She was still holding the wand. Her pigtails blew in the bright wind.

“Yeah, yeah, but what happened?” said Jack in a daze. He was freezing and out of breath. “Where are we?”

“I don’t know,” whispered Annie.

Jack shielded his eyes from the brilliant light of the red dawn and looked around. Pink clouds floated through the air like piles of cotton candy. Through a gap in the clouds, he saw hills shrouded in black smoke below. Beneath the smoke, flames rose from the city of Edo.

“I think we’re on Mount Fuji,” said Annie.

“Mount Fuji?” said Jack. “That’s crazy! Why are we here?” He stopped to catch his breath. He felt dizzy and light-headed. “Edo’s burning! We should be there!”

“Maybe the wand didn’t understand,” said Annie. “Maybe it was trying to save us by taking us far away from the fire.”

Suddenly a great mass of thick clouds piled up, ringing the mountaintop like a wall. The clouds swirled and whirled and tumbled. They changed color, from rose to gold to gray to white.

“What’s going on?” cried Jack.

The head of a gigantic monster rose from the bubbling clouds!

“AHHH!” Jack and Annie screamed. They grabbed each other and crouched down on the rocky ledge.

The monster had spiky eyebrows and long, curled whiskers. It had the horns of a deer, the forked tongue of a snake, and the fiery breath of a dragon. Through the swirling clouds, Jack and Annie could see the dragon’s snake-like body curling through the clouds and down the mountainside. Its back was covered with shiny scales. Its spine had a row of shark-like fins.

The dragon reached out its claws. They were like the claws of an eagle—only a thousand times bigger! The claws gripped the side of the mountain.

Jack made himself as small as he could. He covered his head. But Annie jumped to her feet. “I get it!” she cried. “I know what’s happening! Thank you for coming!”

“Annie, get down!” Jack shouted.

“Jack, it’s the Cloud Dragon!” said Annie. “The puppet show—remember? The wand sent her here!”

“What? Why?” cried Jack.

“She makes rain! Don’t you remember? Rain!” cried Annie. “She commands the rain clouds!”

The dragon lowered her giant head, stretching it over the mountain ledge. Her scales glittered honey-gold in the dawn light. She was still, very still, as if she were waiting for something.

“Come on! We have to climb on her back!” shouted Annie.

“Why?” cried Jack.

“We have to go with her!” said Annie. “The wand brought us to the dragon! Now it’s up to us to show her what to do!”

“Okay! Okay!” said Jack.

Annie climbed onto the back of the Cloud Dragon. She sat between two of the dragon’s shark-like fins. Jack climbed on behind her. He gripped the fin in front of him as if he were holding on to the horn of a saddle.

“Fly over the fire!” yelled Annie. “Make rain!”

“Lots of it!” shouted Jack.

The Cloud Dragon slid off the mountain ledge. Jack trembled with cold as the monster slithered through the freezing sea of clouds, like a snake through the grass.

Above Edo, Jack looked down. Billowing black smoke and red flames shot into the dawn sky.

“Now! Rain now!” Jack said. The Cloud Dragon reared back her head. Great black clouds flowed from her mouth. The clouds spread across the sky. There was a crack of thunder and a flash of lightning. Then rain began to pour down on the city.

The dragon twisted her head this way and that. More clouds blew from her mouth, and more rain fell on the burning city of Edo.

As the dragon slithered through the sky, breathing out mountains of storm clouds, rain fell

on the flat lands of the rice fields,

on the Imperial Garden,

the samurai castles,

the fish market,

and the Great Bridge.





Rain fell on the floating world of inns and stages, teahouses, temples, and farms.

Rain fell on the lumberyard and the pine forest and the canals.

Slowly the rain washed away all the smoke and flames. Even after the fires of Edo no longer flickered, the Cloud Dragon breathed more black clouds, and the rain kept falling, falling steadily, soaking the gardens and fields, filling the shallow rivers and dried-up ponds.

“The fire’s out!” Jack shouted.

“Take us to Basho’s!” Annie yelled to the dragon.

The Cloud Dragon twisted her giant body. She slid through the dark clouds. Then she reared up—until Jack and Annie couldn’t hold on any longer and they were falling backward, somersaulting through the air!

SPLASH! SPLASH!

Jack sank to the bottom of the river. He flailed his arms and struggled to the surface. His head bobbed up—he spewed out water and gasped for air. He had lost his glasses. He dove back down and grabbed them from the river bottom, then swam back to the surface. Treading water, he wiped his glasses, then put them on.

“Hi!” Annie yelled. She was holding the wand in the air, above the water.

“Hi!” Jack yelled back.

Jack and Annie swam toward the bank of the river. They swam until their feet could touch bottom. Then they dragged themselves out of the water and collapsed on the muddy bank.

They had lost their socks and sandals. Their silk kimonos clung to their bodies. Dripping wet, they gasped for breath and looked up at the sky.

Big drops of rain splashed on their faces. There was no sign of the Cloud Dragon. But the cool rain kept falling, bathing the floating world of Edo.



9. Flowers of Edo

“We did it!” said Annie. “We made our own magic!”

“Yeah, we got the Cloud Dragon to put out the fire,” breathed Jack. He felt dazed. “Do you think we’re near Basho’s house?”

“I think so,” said Annie. “We asked the Cloud Dragon to take us there, so I bet she did. Come on, let’s find Basho.”

Jack and Annie stood up and started walking along the edge of the river. They walked barefoot through the mud, under dripping trees.

“Hey, there’s the clearing,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie headed toward the clearing beyond the trees and tall grass.

“Oh, no!” cried Annie. “Look!”

In the clearing, rain was falling on the charred ruins of Basho’s house. The shingled roof and the bamboo walls of the little hut had burned and collapsed.

“Where’s Basho?” said Jack, scared.

“There!” said Annie.

The famous poet sat on a log next to his banana tree in the gray rain. His clothes were blackened. His face was covered with soot. He clutched his writing box.

“Basho!” yelled Annie.

Basho looked up. A smile crossed his dirty, weathered face. “I looked for you by the river, but didn’t see you!” he said. “I am glad you are safe.”

“We’re glad you’re safe, too,” said Jack.

“But your castle! Your castle burned down,” said Annie.

“Yes. It burned before the miracle of the rain,” said Basho, sighing.

Jack and Annie sat on the log next to him. Through the smoky drizzle, they all stared at the rubble. Trees and plants dripped with rain. A pigeon cooed.

For a long moment, no one spoke. Then Annie broke the silence. “I’m glad you still have your banana tree,” she said. “I like the sound of the rain falling on the leaves.”

Basho looked up, but didn’t say anything.

“Yeah, and I like the sound of the river,” said Jack. “It’s louder now since the rain came.”

Basho tilted his head as if listening to the rain on the leaves of the banana plant and to the steady rushing sounds of the river. His face softened. “Yes, I like those things, too,” he said. He held up his wooden box. “And I still have my poems.”

“Don’t worry, Basho,” said Annie. “Everything can be built again.”

“And your castle will be even more beautiful than before,” said Jack.

Basho smiled. “I suppose that is why the ancients called our fires ‘the flowers of Edo,’” he said.

“What do you mean?” asked Jack.

“After something is destroyed by fire, a good new thing often takes its place,” said Basho. “Just as after the bleakest winter, beautiful flowers return with the spring.”

“I’m sure you’ll make many beautiful flowers,” said Annie.

“Thank you,” said Basho. “I am sorry, though, that you and Jack will not have a place to stay now.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “We have to travel back to our own house.”

“How far away is that?” asked Basho.

“Very far,” said Annie. She and Jack stood up. “But we just need to get back to the Imperial Garden. We’ll know the way from there.”

“Good,” said Basho. He stood up. “Come, I will accompany you back to the garden.”

“Thanks, that would be great!” said Jack.

Basho picked up his walking stick. Then he led Jack and Annie along the bank of the river. Through the light drizzle, they saw a ferryboat moving upstream. Basho waved, and the pilot steered the boat to shore.

Jack and Annie followed Basho onto the ferry. The three of them sat together on a wooden bench. The other passengers stared at them. Many had ashes on their clothes and soot on their faces. Jack was relieved to see that no samurai were on board.

“Greetings, Master Basho,” the pilot said. The other passengers nodded respectfully to Basho. They smiled as if the presence of the great poet gave them hope.

“The rains were a miracle, were they not, Master Basho?” an old woman said.

“Indeed they were,” said Basho.

“I guess the Cloud Dragon showed up just in time,” said Annie.

“Annie,” whispered Jack.

Basho smiled at her. “I am afraid no one believes in the Cloud Dragon anymore, Annie,” he said. “But it is lovely to pretend, is it not?”

“Yes, it is lovely,” said Annie.

The rain stopped as the ferryboat traveled on up the river. Mist rose from the water, and birds began to sing.

When they passed the teahouses, Jack and Annie saw firefighters cleaning up after the fire, sweeping up broken tiles and scrubbing the walkways. Waiters were bringing them tea.

The sun was shining by the time they passed the puppet stage and the charred lumberyard. Wisps of smoke still rose from the black piles of burned logs.

The ferryboat floated on through the bright morning. It glided under the Great Bridge and past the crowded fish market. Fishermen were hauling in their catch from the night before.

By the time they moved past the samurai castles and came near the moat of the Imperial Garden, the sun had completely dried out Jack’s and Annie’s kimonos.

The boat pulled up to the landing. Basho helped Jack and Annie onto the dock. He waved good-bye to the boat passengers.



Jack, Annie, and Basho walked over the stone bridge that crossed the moat. They walked through the massive gate in the high wall. Then they followed the paths of the Imperial Garden, around the big rocks and the pond with the swans.

Jack kept an eye out for horses and samurai warriors. But the garden was as peaceful as when they had first landed. It was filled with birdsong. The willows swayed. Water from the waterfall tumbled into the green pool. Jack caught sight of the sun shining on the tree house high in the cherry tree.

Jack stopped walking. “We know our way home from here,” he said to Basho.

“Are you certain?” asked Basho. He did not seem to notice the tree house in the cherry tree.

“We’re sure,” said Annie. “Once we start on our way, the trip will be easy.”

Basho nodded. “You remind me of the famous saying of the samurai Musashi,” he said. “‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.’”

“I’ve heard that saying before,” said Jack.

“Words can outlive their creators,” said Basho. “Though I will never be so lucky as to have mine outlive me.”

“Don’t be too sure of that,” said Annie.

Basho gave them a little smile. “I hope you both will return to Edo someday,” he said. “Look for me when you come back. I should have a lovely new castle on the river by then.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“Good-bye,” said Annie.

They both bowed to Basho.

Basho bowed to them. Then the great poet turned and left them. Falling cherry blossoms floated on the wind as he walked away.

Jack and Annie watched Basho until they could no longer see him. Then they turned to go. Just as they started walking, a man stepped out from the shadows of the garden. The man wore a blue coat and two swords hung from his belt.

“Excuse me,” said the samurai. “May I see your passports, please?”



10. Journey of a Thousand Miles

Jack couldn’t speak.

“Our passports?” said Annie. “They—um— they got destroyed in a fire—on the other side of the Great Bridge.”

The samurai narrowed his eyes. “Your passports burned?.” he said. “Why were you on the other side of the Great Bridge?”

“We were with Master Basho,” said Jack.

“Master Basho?” said the samurai.

“Yes,” said Annie. “We are students of his.”

“Ah!” The samurai’s expression brightened. “So you study poetry with Master Basho?”

“Yes,” said Annie. “Would you like to hear some poems?”

Oh, no! thought Jack. Not again!

“Yes, please,” said the samurai.

“No problem.” Annie thought for a moment and then said: “Here’s a simple little poem.” She recited:

Rain falls outside,

But the tiny cricket on the hearth

Is dry tonight.



The samurai nodded. “Hmm,” he said. “Yes. Very simple, but very lovely.”

“Thank you,” said Annie.

The man turned to Jack. Jack could hardly breathe. His mind was blank. He looked to Annie for help. But Annie just smiled, waiting to hear his poem.

Jack cleared his throat. He tried to stay calm. He closed his eyes and let his mind roam over their visit to Japan. He opened his eyes. He looked up at the cloudless sky and said:

The sun is shining,

The day is hot.

But moonlight

And cool breezes

Still fill my heart,

Left over from last night.



“Whoa!” whispered Annie. “Good!”

“Yes, very good!” said the samurai. He looked at the sky. “The moonlight, the cool breeze,” he mused, “left over from the night. Very good. Master Basho has taught you well!”

The samurai strolled away, shaking his head and murmuring to himself. He let out a happy laugh, as if delighted with the day.

Jack couldn’t believe it. They were free! “Hurry, let’s go,” he said. “Before someone else sees us!”

Jack and Annie ran to the rope ladder and started up. As soon as they climbed inside the tree house, Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He found a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “As the famous samurai once said, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step,’” said Jack.

“Or one sentence,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. He pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go home.”

Annie gasped. “Wait a minute!” she said. “We forgot our mission!”

“What?” said Jack.

But the wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



The early-morning air was cold.

Jack and Annie were back in Frog Creek, wearing their own clothes. Jack’s burlap bag was a backpack again. He looked inside to make sure the Wand of Dianthus was there. It was. And Basho’s frog poem was there, too.

“I can’t believe it!” said Annie. “We didn’t look for a secret of happiness for Merlin. How could we forget that?”

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “We were so busy worrying about the samurai and putting out the fire that we forgot our mission.”

“What will Morgan say?” said Annie. “We’ve never forgotten a mission before! And this one was the most important we’ve ever had! To help save Merlin!” Annie was near tears.

“Wait, wait. Calm down,” said Jack. “Let’s think a minute. Maybe we actually found a secret of happiness. Maybe we just don’t know we found it.”

“You mean, like—were we extra happy at any time?” asked Annie.

“Yeah, sort of,” said Jack. “Were we?”

“I don’t know, were you?” said Annie.

“I think a few times …,” said Jack.

“Like when?” said Annie.

“Like when we were crossing the Great Bridge with Basho, I felt sort of happy then,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie. “And I was pretty happy eating sushi.”

“Yeah, but I got scared when I saw the samurai watching me,” said Jack.

“What about the sumo-wrestling match?” asked Annie.

“That was fun,” said Jack. “But I don’t know if it really made me happy.”

“Riding the dragon and putting out the fire?” said Annie.

“That was great,” said Jack. “But I was too worried about saving the city to be happy.”

“Making up poems for the samurai?” said Annie.

“Too nervous,” said Jack.

“Well, when were you purely happy?” said Annie.

“I think it was when …” Jack stopped. He felt silly saying what he was about to say.

“Go ahead,” said Annie.

“I think it was when I was lying on the mat in Basho’s house,” said Jack, “and I touched that little patch of moonlight on the floor and I listened to the banana leaves in the wind.”

“Oh, yes!” said Annie. “Before we fell asleep, and I heard the cricket and I felt like I was a cricket myself going to sleep in a cozy place.”

“Yeah, like that,” said Jack.

“It’s like what Basho said about finding beauty in the small things of nature,” said Annie, “like his poem about that frog splashing in the water.”

“I think that’s it!” said Jack. “A secret of happiness is paying really close attention to the small things in nature.”

“Wow,” said Annie. “I think that’s a great secret to share with Merlin.”

“It is,” said Jack, “and Basho’s poem will help Merlin understand.”

“Right,” said Annie.

“Let’s go,” said Jack.

Annie climbed down the rope ladder. Jack put his pack on his back and followed her.

As Jack and Annie started through the chilly woods together, Jack noticed things he hadn’t seen before. He saw tiny blue wild-flowers sprouting up from the winter-weary ground.

He saw fresh anthills in the dirt.

He saw leaf buds on twigs and green moss on a rock, bright in the March sunlight.

“I feel like I’m seeing spring for the first time,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie.

“Not just for the first time this year,” said Jack. “But for the first time in my whole life.”





“Me too,” said Annie.

Jack felt happy, really happy, as he and Annie headed for home in the sparkling morning light.



More About Basho, Edo, and Haiku

The poet Basho was born in Japan in 1644. His family wanted him to grow up to be a samurai. But when he was a young man, he decided to write poetry instead.

Basho was poor and unknown for many years. Gradually, though, people started to read his poetry and, over time, he became very famous! His poetry fans built him a small house near the river Sumida. A student gave him a banana tree—basho, in Japanese—to plant in his yard. In 1682, Basho’s house was destroyed by a fire that swept through Edo. (Edo was often in danger from fires because the buildings were made of wood. As mentioned in this story, a terrible fire in 1657 had burned nearly all the city!)

A new house was built for Basho, but he did not live there for long. In 1684, he began the first of his journeys around Japan. Basho even wrote a book about his travels called The Narrow Road to the Deep North, in which he combined journal writing and poetry.

The form of poetry that Basho is famous for is called haiku (say HI-koo). It is the shortest form of Japanese poetry. Haiku poetry is written in plain speech and often describes humble things of everyday life. At first, haiku poetry seems very simple, but it can have a deep effect on a reader. A good haiku poem can waken your senses and help you see life in a fresh way—like it did for Jack, Annie, and the other people in this story.

Jack poured milk over his cereal. His stomach felt fluttery. It was Monday—the first day of a new school year.

Jack always felt nervous on the first day. What would his new teacher be like? Would his desk be close to a window? Would friends from last year be in his class again this year?

“Annie, hurry!” Jack’s mom called upstairs. “It’s fifteen minutes till eight. School starts in half an hour.”

Jack’s dad walked into the kitchen. “Are you sure you and Annie don’t want me to drive you?” he asked.

“No thanks, we don’t mind walking,” said Jack. Their school was only three blocks away.

“Annie, hurry!” their mom called again. “You’re going to be late!”

The back door banged open. Annie rushed into the kitchen. She was out of breath.

“Oh, I thought you were upstairs,” their mom said with surprise. “You were outside?”

“Yes!” said Annie, panting. “Just taking a quick walk.” She looked at Jack. Her eyes sparkled. “Hurry, Jack. We really should go now!”

“Okay, I’m coming!” said Jack. He leapt up from the table. He could tell Annie wasn’t talking about school. The tree house must be back! Finally!

Jack grabbed his backpack. Annie held the door open for him.

“No breakfast?” their mom asked.

“Too nervous to eat now, Mom,” said Jack.

“Have fun,” their mom said.

“Learn a lot,” said their dad.

“Don’t worry, we will!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie slipped out the door and walked quickly across their yard.

“It’s back!” said Annie.

“I figured it was!” said Jack.

“Morgan must want us to look for another secret of happiness to help Merlin,” said Annie.

“Yep!” said Jack. “Let’s run!”

Jack and Annie dashed up the sidewalk. They crossed the street and headed into the Frog Creek woods. They ran between the trees, through shadows and light, until they came to the tallest oak.

High in the tree was the magic tree house. The rope ladder was swaying in the chilly morning wind.

“How did you know it was here?” asked Jack, catching his breath.

“I woke up thinking about Teddy and Kathleen,” said Annie, “and I had this strange feeling.”

“Really?” said Jack. “Teddy! Kathleen!” he shouted up at the tree house.

Two young teenagers looked out the tree house window: a curly-haired boy with freckles and a big grin and a smiling girl with sea-blue eyes and dark wavy hair.

“Jack! Annie!” the girl said.

“Come up! Come up!” said the boy.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, they threw their arms around their friends.

“Are we going to look for another secret of happiness?” said Annie. “To help Merlin?”

“Yes, and this time you will travel back to Florence, Italy, five hundred years ago,” said Teddy.

“Florence, Italy?” said Jack. “What’s there?”

“An amazing person who will help you,” said Kathleen.

“Who?” asked Annie. “Is this person magical?”

Teddy grinned. “Some people might say so,” he said. He reached into his cloak and pulled out a book. The cover showed a drawing of a man wearing a purple cloak and floppy blue cap. He had a long nose, bright, kind eyes with heavy eyebrows, and a flowing beard. The title said:

“Leonardo da Vinci!” said Jack. “Are you kidding?”

“I’ve heard of him,” said Annie.

“Who hasn’t?” said Jack. “He was an incredible genius!”

“This biography of Leonardo will help you on your mission,” said Teddy.

“And so will this rhyme from Morgan,” said Kathleen. She pulled a small piece of parchment paper from her cloak and gave it to Annie.

Annie read the words on the paper aloud.

To Jack and Annie of Frog Creek:

Though the question is quite simple,

Simple answers might be wrong.

If you want to know the right one,

Help the genius all day long,

Morning, noon, and afternoon,

Till the night bird sings its song.

“So to find the secret of happiness, we need to spend the whole day helping Leonardo da Vinci,” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. Teddy nodded.

“I wish you could come, too,” said Annie.

“And help us,” said Jack.

“Never fear,” said Kathleen. “You will have the help of the great genius and the Wand of Dianthus.”

“Oh!” Annie said to Jack. “Did you bring our wand?”

“Of course,” said Jack. “I always carry it with me for safekeeping.” He reached into his backpack and pulled out a gleaming silver wand.

“The Wand of Dianthus,” Teddy said in a hushed voice.

The wand looked like the horn of a unicorn. It burned in Jack’s hand—with cold or warmth, he couldn’t tell which. He carefully put the wand back into his pack.

“Remember the three rules of the wand?” said Kathleen.

“Sure,” said Annie. “You can only use it for the good of others. You can only use it after you’ve tried your hardest. And you can only use it with a command of five words.”

“Excellent,” said Kathleen.

“Thanks,” said Annie. “Ready?” she asked Jack.

Jack nodded. “Bye, Teddy. Bye, Kathleen.”

“Good-bye,” said Teddy.

“And good luck,” said Kathleen.

Jack pointed at the cover of the book. “I wish we could go to Leonardo da Vinci!”

In the distance, the school bell started to ring, letting kids know that school would start in ten minutes. But in the Frog Creek woods, the wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Teachers and librarians love

Magic Tree House® books, too!

Thank you for opening faraway places and times to my class through your books. They have given me the chance to bring in additional books, materials, and videos to share with the class.—J. Cameron



It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books … I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year … WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home … I have since introduced this great series to my class. They have absolutely fallen in love with these books! … My students are now asking me for more independent reading time to read them. Your stories have inspired even my most struggling readers.—M. Payne



I love how I can go beyond the [Magic Tree House] books and use them as springboards for other learning.—R. Gale



We have enjoyed your books all year long. We check your Web site to find new information. We pull our map down to find the areas where the adventures take place.

During spring vacation when I was in kindergarten, my brothers and I decided we’d try to fly like birds. We knew that people couldn’t fly, but that didn’t stop us. We were excited by the thought that we’d be the first to do so. For our launch pad, we chose the playground near our house. We tried swinging and then leaping into the air, flapping our arms wildly. Of course, we kept falling to the ground. Next we climbed to the top of the slide and took turns jumping off, again flapping as hard as we could—only to drop again and again to the sand beneath the slide. We were lucky that we didn’t get hurt. All morning we tried to fly, until finally we gave up and went home, satisfied that we’d given it our best shot.

The great thing about being a kid, I think, is that your imagination can make life full of wondrous adventures. Leonardo da Vinci, one of the world’s greatest geniuses, was a lot like a kid who never completely grew up. Even when he was working, he seemed to be playing, always looking at the world and asking, “I wonder what would happen if …” He had great enthusiasm for experimenting with different ways of doing things and for exploring new ideas—including trying to fly! I hope that when you meet Leonardo in this new Merlin Mission, you will feel that you’ve made an amazing new friend.

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history! And no time at all would pass in Frog Creek while they were gone.

Jack and Annie also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot. After they went on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending Jack and Annie on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history. After proving to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he entrusted them with the Wand of Dianthus. With the help of the wand, Jack and Annie would now be able to make their own magic.

On their most recent adventure, Teddy and Kathleen told Jack and Annie that Merlin was very unhappy and not well and that Morgan wanted them to search for four of the secrets of happiness to share with Merlin.

Now Jack and Annie are waiting for the tree house to return and take them on their second mission to help Merlin….



1. Old Friends





Jack poured milk over his cereal. His stomach felt fluttery. It was Monday—the first day of a new school year.

Jack always felt nervous on the first day. What would his new teacher be like? Would his desk be close to a window? Would friends from last year be in his class again this year?

“Annie, hurry!” Jack’s mom called upstairs. “It’s fifteen minutes till eight. School starts in half an hour.”

Jack’s dad walked into the kitchen. “Are you sure you and Annie don’t want me to drive you?” he asked.

“No thanks, we don’t mind walking,” said Jack. Their school was only three blocks away.

“Annie, hurry!” their mom called again. “You’re going to be late!”

The back door banged open. Annie rushed into the kitchen. She was out of breath.

“Oh, I thought you were upstairs,” their mom said with surprise. “You were outside?”

“Yes!” said Annie, panting. “Just taking a quick walk.” She looked at Jack. Her eyes sparkled. “Hurry, Jack. We really should go now!”

“Okay, I’m coming!” said Jack. He leapt up from the table. He could tell Annie wasn’t talking about school. The tree house must be back! Finally!

Jack grabbed his backpack. Annie held the door open for him.

“No breakfast?” their mom asked.

“Too nervous to eat now, Mom,” said Jack.

“Have fun,” their mom said.

“Learn a lot,” said their dad.

“Don’t worry, we will!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie slipped out the door and walked quickly across their yard.

“It’s back!” said Annie.

“I figured it was!” said Jack.

“Morgan must want us to look for another secret of happiness to help Merlin,” said Annie.

“Yep!” said Jack. “Let’s run!”

Jack and Annie dashed up the sidewalk. They crossed the street and headed into the Frog Creek woods. They ran between the trees, through shadows and light, until they came to the tallest oak.

High in the tree was the magic tree house. The rope ladder was swaying in the chilly morning wind.

“How did you know it was here?” asked Jack, catching his breath.

“I woke up thinking about Teddy and Kathleen,” said Annie, “and I had this strange feeling.”

“Really?” said Jack. “Teddy! Kathleen!” he shouted up at the tree house.

Two young teenagers looked out the tree house window: a curly-haired boy with freckles and a big grin and a smiling girl with sea-blue eyes and dark wavy hair.

“Jack! Annie!” the girl said.

“Come up! Come up!” said the boy.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, they threw their arms around their friends.

“Are we going to look for another secret of happiness?” said Annie. “To help Merlin?”

“Yes, and this time you will travel back to Florence, Italy, five hundred years ago,” said Teddy.

“Florence, Italy?” said Jack. “What’s there?”

“An amazing person who will help you,” said Kathleen.

“Who?” asked Annie. “Is this person magical?”

Teddy grinned. “Some people might say so,” he said. He reached into his cloak and pulled out a book. The cover showed a drawing of a man wearing a purple cloak and floppy blue cap. He had a long nose, bright, kind eyes with heavy eyebrows, and a flowing beard. The title said:

“Leonardo da Vinci!” said Jack. “Are you kidding?”

“I’ve heard of him,” said Annie.

“Who hasn’t?” said Jack. “He was an incredible genius!”

“This biography of Leonardo will help you on your mission,” said Teddy.

“And so will this rhyme from Morgan,” said Kathleen. She pulled a small piece of parchment paper from her cloak and gave it to Annie.

Annie read the words on the paper aloud.

To Jack and Annie of Frog Creek:

Though the question is quite simple,

Simple answers might be wrong.

If you want to know the right one,

Help the genius all day long,

Morning, noon, and afternoon,

Till the night bird sings its song.



“So to find the secret of happiness, we need to spend the whole day helping Leonardo da Vinci,” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. Teddy nodded.

“I wish you could come, too,” said Annie.

“And help us,” said Jack.

“Never fear,” said Kathleen. “You will have the help of the great genius and the Wand of Dianthus.”

“Oh!” Annie said to Jack. “Did you bring our wand?”

“Of course,” said Jack. “I always carry it with me for safekeeping.” He reached into his backpack and pulled out a gleaming silver wand.

“The Wand of Dianthus,” Teddy said in a hushed voice.

The wand looked like the horn of a unicorn. It burned in Jack’s hand—with cold or warmth, he couldn’t tell which. He carefully put the wand back into his pack.

“Remember the three rules of the wand?” said Kathleen.

“Sure,” said Annie. “You can only use it for the good of others. You can only use it after you’ve tried your hardest. And you can only use it with a command of five words.”

“Excellent,” said Kathleen.

“Thanks,” said Annie. “Ready?” she asked Jack.

Jack nodded. “Bye, Teddy. Bye, Kathleen.”

“Good-bye,” said Teddy.

“And good luck,” said Kathleen.

Jack pointed at the cover of the book. “I wish we could go to Leonardo da Vinci!”

In the distance, the school bell started to ring, letting kids know that school would start in ten minutes. But in the Frog Creek woods, the wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

2. Looking for Leonardo




A different bell was bonging in the distance. Bright early sunlight poured through the tree house window. Teddy and Kathleen were gone.

Jack looked down at his clothes. He was wearing a knee-length tunic and dark tights. Annie wore a long dress with puffy sleeves. Jack’s backpack had changed into a cloth bag.

Jack and Annie looked out the window. The tree house had landed in a tall tree in a garden surrounded by green hedges. Beyond the garden was a sea of red-tiled roofs. A huge eight-sided dome and a stone tower rose high above the red rooftops.



“Welcome to Florence, Italy,” said Annie.

Jack opened their book and read aloud:

In the early 1500s, many artists and craftspeople lived in the city of Florence. The city was filled with silk weavers, potters, and marble workers. Artists made sculptures, paintings, and tapestries.



“Cool,” said Annie. “I love art.”

Jack read more:

But the most amazing genius of that time did a bit of everything. Leonardo da Vinci was not only a great painter but also an inventor, architect, stage and costume designer, horseman, chef, geologist, and botanist.



“What’s a geologist and a botanist?” said Annie.

“They’re scientists,” said Jack. “A geologist studies rocks, and a botanist studies plants.” He turned the page.

“Come on, we should go,” said Annie. “The tree house probably brought us right to Leonardo. We have to find him before he gets away!”

“Oh, right,” said Jack.

Annie started down the ladder. Jack packed up their research book and climbed down after her.

Jack and Annie walked around the tall hedge and came to a busy road that ran along a river. They stared at all the people going by. There were women in long silk dresses, priests in black robes riding donkeys, and soldiers in blue capes riding horses.

“I don’t see anyone who looks like the guy on the cover of our book,” said Jack.

“Let’s ask someone,” said Annie. She walked over to a girl selling flowers by the road. “Excuse me. Do you know a person named Leonardo da Vinci?”

“Of course! Everyone knows Leonardo!” said the girl. “He was just here! He bought some flowers from me. He said he was going to sketch them later.” Her eyes shone with excitement.

“Where did he go?” asked Jack.

“He headed toward the Old Bridge,” the girl said. She pointed toward a covered bridge farther down the road.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie walked quickly along the bank of the river toward the bridge. “You were right,” said Jack. “The tree house brought us right to Leonardo. But while we were talking, he kept walking.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “We’ll catch up to him.”

The covered bridge was supported by three stone arches. It looked like a long house stretching over the river.

As they crossed the bridge, it was hard to look for Leonardo. The light was dim and the walkway inside the bridge was filled with people.

Jack and Annie squeezed through the crowd to the other side of the bridge. The sunlight was so bright that Jack still couldn’t see clearly. He shaded his eyes with his hand. “I still don’t see him,” he said.

“We can ask again,” said Annie. “That girl said everyone knows Leonardo!” She headed to a shop near the riverbank. Weavers were hanging colorful fabrics on a line. The red and purple silks waved in the breeze.

“Excuse me!” Annie called. “Have you seen Leonardo da Vinci this morning?”

A toothless old woman smiled. “Oh, yes! Leonardo passed by only a moment ago,” she said. “On his way to the bakery, I think.” She pointed down a narrow lane. “He goes there every morning.”

“Thanks!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie hurried to the bakery. The delicious smell of baking bread filled the air.

“Excuse me, did Leonardo da Vinci come in here?” Jack asked.

“Yes, he just bought his daily loaf of bread,” said the baker. “He always goes to the cheese shop next.” He pointed across the street.

“Thanks!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie crossed the busy street to the cheese shop. “Is Leonardo da Vinci here?” asked Annie.

“He just left,” said the cheese man. He pointed up the street. “He was going to the blacksmith’s.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

“Thanks!” said Annie, and they headed up the street.

“I can’t wait to meet him!” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “If we ever catch up to him.”

Loud hammering noises were coming from a shop. Jack and Annie looked inside and saw a blacksmith pounding a horseshoe with a huge iron hammer. A fire was roaring in a hearth nearby.

“Excuse me!” Jack shouted.

The burly man stopped pounding.

“Was Leonardo da Vinci just here?” asked Jack.

“Yes, he paid me for his iron pots,” the blacksmith said gruffly. “Finally.”

“Do you know where he was going next?” asked Jack.

“Headed for the market, in a big hurry, as usual,” said the blacksmith, nodding toward the street. Then he went back to pounding.

Jack and Annie ran up the street. They rounded a corner and stepped into a huge square. Sunlight shone down on hundreds of tents and stalls. The air smelled of fish and cinnamon and other spices.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “It’s huge!”

The market was jam-packed with shoppers. It was hard to see over the heads of all the grownups. “We could spend all day looking for Leonardo here,” said Jack.

“This is not good,” said Annie. “We’re supposed to spend the day helping him, not looking for him! Remember the rhyme said, ‘Help the genius all day long, morning, noon, and afternoon, till the night bird sings its song.’”

“Yeah, whatever that means,” said Jack.

“Hey, maybe we should use the wand now,” said Annie. “This situation fits the rules. Finding Leonardo is not just for our good—it’s to help Merlin. And I think we’ve tried our hardest.”

“Okay, let’s use it.” Jack slipped the Wand of Dianthus out of his bag and handed it to Annie. “Five words,” he said.

“I know, I know,” she said. She held up the wand and counted her words on her fingers: “Help. Us. Find. Leonardo. Now.”

Jack and Annie held their breath and waited. But nothing changed. Everything around them looked exactly the same.

“It’s not working,” said Jack. “What did we do wrong?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “I used five words.

It’s definitely good for others. Maybe we haven’t really tried our hardest yet.”

Jack sighed. “Okay let’s keep trying.” He took back the wand and slipped it into his bag.

“Oh, look at the birds over there!” said Annie. She pulled Jack over to a stall that sold caged birds. Only one bird was singing: a brown bird with a reddish tail. He was very plain, but he sang beautifully with whistles and trills.

“Hi, you,” said Annie.

The bird tilted his head and looked straight at Annie. He chirped softly.

“Come on, Annie, we can’t waste time here,” said Jack. “We have to keep looking for Leonardo.”

“But didn’t you hear his song?” said Annie. “He wants to fly away. He wants to be free.”

Jack looked around for the bird seller. He was standing nearby talking to a customer. “Forget it, Annie. We don’t have money to pay for him,” said Jack.



“But he wants me to help him,” said Annie. “I can feel it.” She reached toward the cage door.

“Annie, don’t!” said Jack.

But Annie unlatched the door. The bird hopped onto the ground.

“Oh, no!” said Jack. He grabbed for the bird, but he was too late. The brown bird was already flying away into the blue sky.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“Hey!” shouted the bird seller, rushing over to them. “Were you trying to steal my bird?”

“We weren’t stealing him!” said Annie. “We were setting him free!”

The bird seller grabbed Jack by the arm. “You’ll have to pay for him, then!” he barked.

“But … but …,” stammered Jack.

“Marco, unhand that boy!” a man’s voice boomed.

Jack turned to see a tall man in a purple cloak and floppy blue cap. He had a long nose, bright, kind eyes with heavy eyebrows, and a flowing beard. He looked exactly like the man on the cover of their book.

“Leonardo!” said Annie. “The wand worked!”

3. Ten Types of Noses




“Let the boy go, Marco,” Leonardo said again.

“But I caught him trying to steal my bird,” said Marco.

“No, Marco. The girl said they were setting him free,” said Leonardo. “And I believe her.”

“Then let them pay me!” the bird seller said.

“We don’t have any money,” Annie said in a small voice.

“I will take care of it,” said Leonardo. He put down the basket he was carrying. It was filled with flowers, cheese, and a loaf of bread. He pulled out a gold coin. The bird seller let go of Jack and took the coin.

“Marco, when I lay in my cradle as a child, a bird flew down and struck me with its tail,” said Leonardo. “Ever since then, I have wished—”

“I know, I know,” interrupted Marco, “to be a bird yourself. You have told me this many times, Leonardo.” The bird seller turned away to help a customer.

Leonardo turned to Jack and Annie. “Yes,” he said, “to be a bird myself—which is why I often buy birds from Marco and set them free. So you see, my friends, you and I are kindred spirits.”

“Yes, we are!” said Annie, grinning.

“Thanks for helping us!” said Jack. He gave Leonardo a big smile. He wanted the great genius to like them so they could spend the whole day with him. “I’m Jack and this is my sister, Annie. Actually it was Annie who freed—”

But Leonardo didn’t give Jack a chance to finish. He kept talking. “In truth, I love all creatures! Every bird and animal known to man—and even the ones not known!” He laughed heartily.

“Me too!” said Annie.

“Me too!” said Jack.

Leonardo picked up some bird feathers from the ground. “Ah, beautiful,” he said, holding them up to the sun. “I will sketch these later.” He tucked the feathers into his basket with the bread and cheese and flowers. “Well, I must be on my way now, friends,” he said. “Good day!” Leonardo turned and began walking briskly away from the bird stand.

Oh, no! thought Jack.

Before he could think of anything to say, Annie shouted, “Mr. da Vinci! Leonardo!”

Leonardo looked back at her. “Yes?”

“Do you … um … do you need any help today?” Annie asked. “Jack and I would really, really like to help you … all day … somehow.”

Jack was embarrassed. He was sure Leonardo would say no. But to his surprise, the great genius was looking at them closely and tapping his chin. “Well … actually I am facing a great task this morning,” he said with a smile. He nodded. “Yes. Perhaps you could be my apprentices—just for today.”

“Great!” said Annie.

“What’s an apprentice?” asked Jack.

“Apprentices help a master artist or skilled worker,” said Leonardo. “They work hard and study hard in hopes they’ll become masters themselves someday.”

“Cool,” said Jack.

“Come along, then!” said Leonardo. He started walking again. Jack and Annie hurried alongside him. They left the crowded market and started up a cobblestone street.

“Do you children live in Florence?” asked Leonardo.

“No, we’re from … um … far away,” said Jack.

“We’re here on a mission,” said Annie. “We’re looking for the secret of happiness.”

Leonardo smiled. “Ah, yes, I discovered that secret some time ago,” he said.

“You did?” asked Jack.

“Yes, it’s something I sought and now I have it,” said Leonardo. “It’s really quite simple.”

“What is it?” said Jack.

“The secret of happiness is fame,” said Leonardo.

“Really? Fame?” said Annie.

“Yes!” said Leonardo. “When I look into the eyes of complete strangers and see their awe and admiration—that makes me very happy!”

As Leonardo strode a few feet ahead of them, Annie looked at Jack. “Fame,” she said. “I guess that’s our answer.”

“I don’t know,” said Jack in a soft voice. “Remember what the rhyme said: ‘Though the question is quite simple, simple answers might be wrong.’”

“Oh, yeah!” said Annie. “And the rhyme says that to learn the answer, we have to stay with him all day.”

“Yep,” said Jack. He didn’t mind that part. Spending the day with one of the most amazing geniuses who ever lived seemed like a great idea.

Jack and Annie followed Leonardo into a square with a huge cathedral. On the top of the building was the enormous eight-sided dome that they’d seen from the tree house. How did anyone ever build that? Jack wondered.

As hundreds of people moved about the square, Leonardo stopped. He stared into the crowd. “Oh! Oh!” he said.

“What? What?” asked Annie.

“I see an angel!” said Leonardo.

“An angel?” said Jack. He looked at the crowd. He didn’t see any angels.

“Over there!” Leonardo pointed to a short, dark-haired girl standing by herself. The girl didn’t look at all like an angel to Jack. She looked like an ordinary kid.

Leonardo put down his basket, untied a small book from his belt, and pulled out a piece of chalk. He started to draw. “I have been seeking an angel for one of my paintings,” he murmured as he sketched the girl. “I think I may have found her.”

In a moment, Leonardo was done. “There.” He showed his sketch to Jack and Annie. With just a few quick lines, he had created an angel. The drawing looked just like the real girl, yet somehow she really did look like an angel now.

“That’s the nicest angel I’ve ever seen,” said Annie.

“Hmm, I don’t know,” said Leonardo. “I fear the nose is not quite right. I’m afraid I must keep looking.” He tore the page out of his sketchbook. “Perhaps you and Jack would like to have this?”

“Oh … yes!” said Annie. “Thank you.”

“I’ll carry it,” said Jack. He took the drawing from Leonardo and carefully slid it into his bag, between the pages of their research book.

Leonardo put away his chalk and sketchbook and picked up his basket. “Come along,” he said.

Jack and Annie half walked and half ran, trying to keep up with Leonardo’s long strides.

“When I travel through the streets, I am always gathering information,” Leonardo said. “I observe like a scientist. For instance, after years of observation, I now know there are ten different types of noses.”

“Really?” said Annie. She felt her nose.

“Yes,” said Leonardo, “straight, round, pointed, flat, narrow…. Of course that is from the side. If you look people straight in the face, you will find eleven types of noses.”

“No kidding,” said Jack.

Jack tried to get a good look at the noses they passed. He saw flat ones, round ones, straight ones … but many were hard to describe.

“My observations have also led me to conclude that there are many more types of mouths than noses,” said Leonardo. “But the location of every mouth is almost always the same. It is halfway between the base of the nose and the chin.”

“Really?” said Annie. She held up two fingers, trying to measure the distance between her nose, mouth, and chin. “I think you’re right, Leonardo.”

“I study people’s expressions and gestures,” said Leonardo. “I study their hands, their eyes, their hair. But to be a truly great artist, you must learn to combine your observations with your imagination.” Suddenly he stopped. “Look up, look up!”

Jack and Annie stopped and looked up.

“See the clouds?” said Leonardo.

A few billowy clouds dotted the sky.

“What do they look like to you?” asked Leonardo. “What sorts of things?”

Big white blobs, thought Jack.

“The biggest one looks sort of like a castle,” said Annie.

“Good, good!” said Leonardo.

“And that little one looks like a dog’s head,” said Annie, “like a Scottie puppy.”



A Scottie puppy? thought Jack. He squinted, trying to see a puppy.

“Excellent!” said Leonardo. “And you, Jack? What about that one?” He pointed at a long cloud. “What do you see?”

Jack studied it. “Uh … well, I guess it sort of looks like a boat,” he said.

“Wonderful!” said Leonardo. “I get ideas for my paintings from everything! I look at a watermark on a wall and see an old woman’s face. I look at a food stain on my tablecloth and see a horse! I study rain puddles and rocks and see oceans and mountains!”

“Oh, I do that kind of thing, too!” said Annie.

“I imagine that the very first drawing might have been a simple line drawn around the shadow of a man on the wall of a cave,” said Leonardo.

“Wow,” breathed Annie.

Pretty cool, thought Jack. He liked Leonardo’s way of thinking.

“Listen now to the cathedral bells,” said Leonardo.

Jack listened. The bells played notes that went up and down: Bong-bing-bong-bing.

Bong-bing-bong-bing.

“I hear the bells’ voices as if they were singing to me,” said Leonardo. “Can you hear what they are saying?”

Well … no, thought Jack. He just heard bongs and bings.

“They’re saying: You have much to do this Monday, Leonardo da Vinci! Get to work!” Leonardo laughed. “So let us be on our way, my friends!” And the great genius took off, walking quickly through the streets of Florence.

4. Battle Scene




Jack and Annie hurried to keep up with Leonardo. “So where are we going?” Annie asked.

“To the palace of the great council,” said Leonardo. “I was hired to paint a fresco in the council hall. I have been working on it for months.”

“What’s a fresco?” asked Jack.

“It is a work of art painted onto a wall,” said Leonardo. “One must spread plaster on the wall and then paint very quickly before it dries.”

“Sounds like fun,” said Annie.

“Not for me,” said Leonardo. “I believe great art requires much thought. I like to paint slowly, and I change things as I go along. So for this fresco, I have invented a special oil paint that dries very slowly.”

“Does it work?” said Jack.

“Too well,” said Leonardo. “Now I have a new problem: Neither the plaster nor my oil paints have dried at all.”

“Oh, no,” said Annie.

“But today all will be well!” Leonardo said cheerfully. “I have a plan to speed up the drying process. This morning I will fix everything!”

Leonardo led Jack and Annie into a square with a large building. “There it is,” he said. “The palace of the great council.”

The palace looked like a fortress. It had rough-looking stone walls and a tower that rose high into the air.

“The palace is a very important place,” said Leonardo. “It is where the governing council of Florence meets. Come along.” He opened one of the grand doors and guided Jack and Annie into a courtyard with a fountain. “This way to the council hall,” he said, “and the latest work of Leonardo da Vinci.”

Leonardo bounded up some steps and down a corridor. Jack and Annie hurried after him until he passed through another grand doorway and stopped.

Leonardo put down his basket and raised his hands. “My fresco,” he said.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack.



They were in an enormous room with tall, arched windows and vast white walls. Several young men stood on a wooden platform on the far side of the room. On the wall above them was a giant painting of a battle scene. It showed a tangle of men on horseback, fighting over a flag.

The men in the painting seemed to be in a fury as they slashed at each other with their swords. Their faces were twisted, their mouths snarling. Even their horses looked wild and angry.

“The city has paid me to paint a scene from a battle once fought to defend Florence,” said Leonardo. “They wanted me to paint a scene of glory. But I believe war is a beastly madness. I hope my painting shows that.”

“Oh, it does,” said Annie.

Jack nodded. It was the scariest painting he’d ever seen.

“Zorro!” called Leonardo.

One of the young men on the platform climbed down a ladder and jumped to the floor. He was a sturdy-looking teenager with a red face and wavy black hair.

“Are things any better this morning?” asked Leonardo.

“No, the paint is still very damp to the touch,” said Zorro.

“Then let us proceed with our plan,” said Leonardo. “Did the pots arrive from the blacksmith?”

“Yes, over there,” said Zorro. He pointed at two large iron pots beneath the platform.

“And you brought the wood?” said Leonardo.

“Yes,” said Zorro. He pointed to a pile of wood stacked against a wall.

Leonardo set down his basket and headed over to the platform.

“What’s the plan, Leonardo?” asked Annie as she and Jack followed him.

“My apprentices and I will fill the pots with wood and lift them onto the platform,” said Leonardo. “Then we will light fires in them. The heat of the fires will quickly dry the fresco.”

“How can we help?” asked Jack.

“Bring us some kindling,” said Leonardo.

“No problem!” said Jack. He put down his bag, and he and Annie hurried to the wood stack.

“Kindling?” she said.

“Small pieces of wood,” said Jack. “They catch fire first and help get the big pieces started.”

Jack and Annie picked sticks and twigs from the wood stack. They carried the kindling back to Leonardo, and he dumped it into the iron pots. Zorro brought over some logs. Then he and Leonardo hooked the handles of the pots to a system of ropes and pulleys.

“Pull!” Leonardo shouted.

The apprentices on the platform pulled on the ropes. The heavy pots swung into the air.

“Steady! Steady!” Leonardo shouted.

The apprentices slowly hauled up the pots. Then they pulled them onto the platform and placed them in front of the fresco.

“Light the fires!” shouted Leonardo.

Zorro lit a candle from a torch burning at the entrance of the hall. He carried the candle up the ladder and used its fire to light the kindling. Soon the wood in the pots began to blaze.

“Bring more wood!” Leonardo shouted. “Bring more wood!”

Jack and Annie hurried back to the woodpile. They gathered bigger pieces of wood and rushed back to the ladder. Apprentices lifted the wood up to the platform and added it to the fires in the pots.

Soon flames were shooting high into the air, warming the fresco. Standing with Leonardo below the platform, Jack and Annie stared up at the battle scene. The room grew hotter and hotter.

With the fires blazing above and smoke curling through the air, Jack felt like he was in the middle of the battle himself. He could hear the clanging swords, neighing horses, and shouting men. He could feel the “beastly madness” of war that Leonardo had talked about.

Suddenly Jack heard real shrieks—Leonardo’s apprentices were all yelling.

“It is dripping, Master!” one cried.

“The paint is running!” shouted another.

Jack looked back at the fresco. The helmets of the warriors were melting down over their furious faces.

“AHHH!” cried Leonardo with a look of horror. “Kill the fires! Kill the fires!”

5. Knock, Knock




The panic of the battle scene seemed to spread through the big room. Leonardo’s apprentices looked around wildly, as if they didn’t know what to do.

“Water from the fountain!” Leonardo roared. “Hurry!” He ran out of the room. His apprentices rushed after him.

“We have to help, too!” Jack said to Annie. They took off after the others, following them down the stairs to the courtyard.

The apprentices were filling buckets with water from the fountain. “Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!” Leonardo shouted.

Jack and Annie grabbed two of the full buckets and clumsily followed the others back up the stairs. “This is like—like Edo!” Jack said to Annie, remembering their recent trip to old Japan.



“Yeah,” said Annie, “except that was a city on fire. This is just paint melting.”

True, thought Jack. But Leonardo was acting like it was a matter of life and death.

Inside the hall, Leonardo and the apprentices carried the buckets up the ladder. They splashed water over the flames in the two iron pots. But it was too late. The helmets and faces and swords of the fighting men had become a messy blur of streaks and blotches. The painting was ruined.

Leonardo stared for a long moment at the wall. Then he climbed down the ladder and walked away. When he got to the door, Zorro shouted, “Master, wait!” But Leonardo kept walking.

“We have to follow him,” Annie said to Jack.

“He seems really upset,” said Jack.

“I know,” said Annie. “But we have to do what the rhyme says—‘Help the genius all day long.’”

“But what if he doesn’t want our help anymore?” said Jack.

“Look! He forgot his basket, with all his stuff in it,” said Annie. “We can take it to him.”

“Okay. Good,” said Jack.

Annie picked up Leonardo’s basket filled with feathers, flowers, cheese, and a loaf of bread. Jack grabbed his own bag and they hurried out of the council hall. When they got to the entrance of the palace, they saw Leonardo striding across the square.

“Leonardo!” Annie yelled.

Leonardo didn’t look back. He disappeared down a narrow lane.

“Quick!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie took off across the square. When they got to the lane, they saw Leonardo at the far end.

“Leonardo, wait!” Annie shouted.

But Leonardo didn’t wait. He kept going and rounded a corner.

Annie and Jack ran faster. When they turned the corner, they looked right and left. Kids were playing in the street. Two women were leaning out of windows talking to each other. But there was no sign of Leonardo.

“Excuse me,” Annie called to the women. “Have you seen Leonardo da Vinci?”

“Oh, yes, he just got home!” one woman said.

“He lives just over there!” said her neighbor. She pointed to a narrow building across the street.

“Thank you!” said Annie. She and Jack walked quickly to the building. A stone arch opened onto a wide pathway. They walked under the arch and down the pathway to a sunny cobblestone courtyard. A big white horse was tied to a cart. Chickens pecked the dirt between the warm stones.

“Hi, guys,” Annie said to the horse and chickens.

Jack pointed to an open doorway across the yard. “He’s in there. I hear him,” he said.

Annie and Jack moved quietly across the courtyard. They stopped outside a window.

Leonardo was pacing up and down inside. His cap and cloak were on the floor. His hair was wild.

“I’ll leave Florence—that’s what I’ll do,” Leonardo said to himself. “I shall go to Rome! Or back to Milan!”

Jack turned to Annie. “We shouldn’t bother him,” he whispered. “If I felt that bad, I wouldn’t want people to bother me.”

“Not bother,” said Annie. “Help. If I felt that bad, I’d want people to help me. Come on, at least we can give him his stuff.” Before Jack could stop her, Annie stepped into Leonardo’s room. “Knock, knock,” she said loudly.

Leonardo whirled around. His face was red. He was scowling. “What are you doing here?” he said.

“We brought your things,” said Annie. “You forgot them.” She held up the basket.

“Oh.” Leonardo’s face softened. “Thank you. Leave it all by the door, please,” he said.

Annie put the basket down. Then she looked up at Leonardo.

“We’d better go,” Jack said softly to her.

“Wait.” Annie stepped farther into Leonardo’s room. “We’d like to help you,” she said.

Leonardo scowled again. “You cannot help me,” he said. “Do as your brother says, little girl. Go now.”

But Annie didn’t move. “Excuse me, but we’re supposed to help you all day,” she said. “You made us your apprentices for the day, remember?”

“Can you not see that I am miserable?” said Leonardo.

“But why are you miserable?” said Annie. “You said that fame was the secret of happiness. And you’re still famous.”

“But what good is fame in the face of failure?” shouted Leonardo. “This fresco was to be my masterpiece! What good is fame when everyone will now laugh at me and mock my failure? Go! Please!”

“Oh, okay. I’m sorry,” said Annie in a small voice. “We just wanted to help.” She and Jack turned to go.

“Wait, wait, wait,” said Leonardo. “Forgive me.”

Jack and Annie looked back at Leonardo. The great genius rubbed his face and sighed. Then he waved his hand. “Please, forgive me. Come in, come in,” he said.

“Thanks,” said Annie. And she and Jack stepped inside Leonardo da Vinci’s studio.

6. Thousands of Ideas

A low fire burned in the hearth. Sunlight slanted across the warm room. Jack caught his breath as he looked around Leonardo’s studio.

There were mirrors, wooden trunks, globes, paint pots, and brushes. Sketches, paintings, and handmade maps were all over the walls. There were stacks of old books, half-built furniture, piled-up papers, theater masks, pieces of costumes, and musical instruments.

“Oh, man,” murmured Jack, “I love this room.”

“Me too,” said Annie.

“Please, sit at my table. Let me get you something to eat,” said Leonardo. He pushed a bunch of things to the side of a long wooden table and pulled up two chairs.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He and Annie sat down.

Leonardo took the cheese and bread from the basket by the door and gave some to Jack and Annie. The cheese was dry but tasted good. And the bread was really delicious—hard and crackly on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. Hmm, I wonder how they make it like this, Jack thought.

“So why do you want to leave Florence, Leonardo?” Annie asked, her mouth full.

“Because I will no longer be respected here,” said Leonardo. “Last week, the council told me I must finish my fresco soon. And now I will not finish it at all. Just recently Michelangelo accused me of never finishing anything!”

“Michelangelo? The great artist?” said Jack.

Leonardo snorted. “You think Michelangelo is a great artist? Have you seen his statues? Those men with their big muscles? They look like sacks of walnuts!”

Jack and Annie laughed.

Leonardo tried to hide a smile as he looked at them. “In truth, Michelangelo is a great artist,” he said. “Still, he should not accuse me of never finishing anything … even if it is true.”

“Why don’t you finish things?” asked Annie.

“Well, I shall not finish my battle scene now because I experimented with my paint,” said Leonardo. “I am experimenting all the time. And often my experiments lead nowhere.”

“So is that your main problem?” asked Annie.

“One of them,” said Leonardo, sighing. “The other is that there are too many things I want to do, and there is never enough time!”

“What else do you want to do?” asked Jack.

“Oh, I have thousands of ideas,” said Leonardo. He put down his bread and cheese and crossed to a wooden trunk in the corner of his studio. He raised the lid of the trunk and stared for a moment at its contents.

Leonardo turned back to Jack and Annie. His eyes were bright again. Whatever was in the trunk had made him happier. “Come, look,” he said.

Jack and Annie walked over to the trunk and peered inside. It held dozens and dozens of plain black books, large ones and small ones.

“Notebooks,” said Leonardo. “I have filled over a hundred of them with my ideas.”

“Oh,” said Jack, his eyes wide.

“Jack keeps notebooks, too!” said Annie.

“Do you mind if we look at them?” asked Jack.

“No, not at all,” said Leonardo.

Jack and Annie started picking up the notebooks and turning the pages. The pages were crammed with doodles and writing. They showed sketches of people’s faces, animal heads, flowers, trees, rivers, mountains, the sun, and the moon.

One notebook was filled with drawings of horses. Another had sketches of bridges and buildings. Another had drawings of birds and machines. Many of the drawings in the notebooks had labels written in a strange language.



“You cannot read my notes, can you?” said Leonardo.

Jack and Annie shook their heads.

“Hold them to a mirror,” said Leonardo.

Jack and Annie stood in front of a wall mirror.

Each held up a notebook and looked at its reflection in the mirror.

“Oh, I get it!” said Jack. He could read the words now! Leonardo had written everything backward—from right to left across the page. So the word bird was written as , and the word wind was written as .

“Why do you write this way?” asked Annie.

“People think I am trying to keep my ideas a secret,” said Leonardo. “But, in truth, I am left-handed, and when I write normally from left to right, I smear ink across the page. One day I realized that if I wrote backward, I would not be so messy.” He laughed and sat down at the table. As he took a bite of bread, he seemed his happy self again.

“What do you write in these notebooks?” said Jack.

“Oh, I’ve written down thousands of ideas,” said Leonardo. “For example—” He opened a notebook and read: “Fossils of tiny sea creatures have been found in the mountains of Italy. It is my belief that ocean water once covered the mountains millions of years ago.”

“Your belief is right,” said Jack.

Leonardo looked at Jack with surprise. “You seem so certain,” he said.

“Well, I know from science books that the oceans once covered many mountains of the earth, and that’s why you can find sea fossils there,” said Jack.

“We read lots of books,” said Annie.

“Indeed?” said Leonardo. Then he picked up another notebook and read: “If a wolf stares at you, your voice will become hoarse.”

“Um … that’s not true,” said Annie.

“It is not?” said Leonardo.

“Well, think about it,” said Annie. “How could an animal make a person hoarse? And why would they want to?”

Leonardo nodded. “Yes, I think I agree with you,” he said. He cleared his throat. Then he read another idea: “A spider hatches its eggs by staring at them.”

“Nooo,” said Jack and Annie together.

“No?” said Leonardo.

“Trust us,” said Jack, smiling. This is really fun, he thought, knowing more than a great genius. Scientists have discovered a lot since Leonardo’s time.

“All right. I don’t know why, but I shall trust you,” said Leonardo. He turned some pages and read: “The moon may be bright because it is made out of rippling water.”

Jack shook his head. “Actually it’s made out of rocks,” he said. “It’s bright because it reflects the light of the sun.” Jack knew lots of facts about the moon.

“And did you know there’s no wind on the moon?” said Annie. “So someday when people walk there, their footprints will last forever!”

Leonardo grinned. “Wonderful,” he said. “I fear you are both speaking nonsense. But I like your original thinking!”

He turned the page and read another entry:

“There must be a way to use a natural force, such as steam or wind, to help people do their tasks in less time, with less work—”

“That’s a great idea,” said Jack. “Maybe someday steam engines could run ships. Or maybe steam could help run a train.”

“A train?” said Leonardo.

“Yes, a train!” said Annie. “A train is this thing we’ve imagined. It’s like—um—”

“Like wagons connected to each other!” said Jack. “And they run over tracks that go across the land.”

“Interesting,” said Leonardo. He closed his eyes as if trying to imagine it.

“And then there are planes,” said Annie. “We’ve imagined these things called planes.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, “they have wings, and they fly you through the air.”

“Like birds!” said Annie.

Leonardo sat up very straight. “You imagine such a flying thing is possible?” he asked.

“We’re positive,” said Jack.

Leonardo leapt to his feet. “You have been sent to me as a sign!” he said.

“A sign of what?” said Annie.

Leonardo’s eyes were gleaming. “I, too, believe humans can fly like birds. And today I shall prove it!”

“You will?” said Jack.

“Yes! Until now, I have been fearful of testing my idea,” said Leonardo. “But the two of you have given me courage!”

What is Leonardo talking about? Jack wondered.

“I am sure my plan will work now!” said Leonardo. “And it will bring me everlasting fame!”

“We don’t really know that much about flying,” Jack said.

“Yeah, we were just imagining,” said Annie.

But Leonardo had grabbed his cap and cloak. “Come with me, friends!” He headed out to the courtyard.

Jack grabbed his bag, and he and Annie followed. Leonardo jumped into the horse cart and picked up the reins. “Climb in! Climb in!” he said.

Jack and Annie climbed into the cart and sat beside Leonardo.

“Today the Great Bird shall rise aloft high into the sky!” said Leonardo. “And the universe shall be filled with wonder!”

7. The Great Bird




Leonardo shook the reins. The white horse clopped out of the courtyard and into the street.

“So where are we going?” Annie asked.

“To a steep hill just outside the city walls,” said Leonardo. “One day you will tell people that you were with me on this historic Monday. You saw the mad genius, Leonardo da Vinci, and his Great Bird!”

“Cool, but can you tell us exactly what you’re planning to do?” said Jack.

“For twenty-five years, I have sketched birds and bats,” said Leonardo. “I have studied all their movements, their gliding, their flapping, their landing, and their rising into the air. I have asked myself over and over, Why can a person not fly as birds do? So, years ago I began building my Great Bird.”

“Your Great Bird?” asked Annie.

“Ha-ha!” laughed Leonardo. “Wait and see! Wait and see!”

The horse pulled the cart through the city gates, heading into the countryside. The chilly air was warmed by bright sunlight.

Leonardo tugged on the reins and his horse turned off the main road and started up a narrow, rocky path. The cart bumped past pale green olive trees and yellow fields of wildflowers. Soon it came to the bottom of a steep hill.

Leonardo pulled the reins and his horse halted. “There! Can you see it?” he said. “My Great Bird.” He pointed to a strange-looking structure on the top of the hill.

“What is it?” asked Jack.

“The wings are like those of a bat, only much, much larger—large enough for a man!” said Leonardo. “About a month ago on a moonlit night, my apprentices and I brought it to the top of this hill. I did not have the confidence to try it then, but now I do.”

Jack was confused. He knew people didn’t fly airplanes until the beginning of the 1900s. “Um—maybe you should work on this one a little longer,” he said. “I mean, maybe—”

“No, no, today is the day! I feel it!” said Leonardo. “Stay here and watch.”

Leonardo leapt down from the cart and took long strides up the steep slope.

“Quick, look up Great Bird in the Leonardo book,” Annie said to Jack.

Jack pulled out their research book and looked up Great Bird in the index. “It’s here!” he said. He found the right page and read aloud:

Leonardo da Vinci spent years making a flying machine that he called the Great Bird. But not until the invention of lightweight motors, nearly 400 years after Leonardo’s time, would human flight be possible. It is not known whether Leonardo ever tried to fly the Great Bird. If he did, he surely crashed.

“Oh, no!” said Annie. “His machine won’t work! If Leonardo tries to fly off that hilltop, he’ll crash. We have to stop him before he hurts himself!”

Annie jumped out of the cart. Jack put the book away. He left his bag in the cart and ran after her. They started up the steep hill.

“Leonardo, stop!” shouted Annie.

But Leonardo kept climbing.

“Human flight isn’t possible yet!” Jack cried.

“Don’t try it, Leonardo!” yelled Annie.

Jack and Annie were only halfway up the hill when Leonardo reached the top. He began strapping himself into a harness on the Great Bird.

Large handles were attached to the harness. On each side were huge cloth wings stretched over a wooden frame.

“Don’t!” shouted Jack.

But Leonardo was already staggering toward the edge of the steep hill with the flying machine on his back. It was so heavy that he could hardly stand up.

“Leonardo, stop!” cried Annie. “You need a motor!”

But Leonardo bent his legs and lowered his body close to the ground. He grabbed the two large handles and pulled them toward his chest. The huge wings rose into the air.

“The Great Bird raises its wings and is pushed by the wind!” shouted Leonardo.

“Noooo!” yelled Jack and Annie.

Leonardo leapt off the side of the hill into the air. A gust of wind lifted him. As the wind held his wings aloft, he pushed and pulled on the handles. The wings moved up and down.



But Leonardo couldn’t make the wings flap fast enough. Though he pushed and pulled wildly on the handles, he soon began falling through the air—until wings and wood and Leonardo all crashed to the ground.

“Leonardo!” yelled Annie.

Jack and Annie charged down the hill. At the bottom, Leonardo da Vinci lay in a silent heap. His twisted wings spread over the grass. Jack and Annie rushed to him.

“Are you all right?” cried Annie.

There was no answer.

Oh, no! We’ve killed him! thought Jack.

But then Leonardo stirred. He moved his hand.

“Are you all right?” Annie asked again.

Leonardo moved his other hand. He rolled over on his side and unbuckled the straps of the harness. He crawled away from the flying machine and hauled himself to a sitting position. His face was scraped and red.

“Are you all right?” Annie asked once more.

Leonardo looked at her. The light had gone out of his eyes. “No,” he said in a quiet voice. “I am not all right.”

“Did you break something?” asked Annie.

Leonardo stood up. He stared at the twisted and torn wings of the Great Bird. He sighed deeply. “Only my heart,” he said. “Only my heart.”

Leonardo turned and limped across the grass back toward his horse and cart. Jack and Annie followed. When Leonardo got to the cart, his white horse snorted, as if trying to comfort him. Leonardo pressed his head against the horse’s neck.

Annie stepped toward him. “Why is your heart broken, Leonardo?” she asked quietly.

Leonardo looked back at the hill. “All my life, I have started projects that have come to nothing,” he said. “My towers and bridges have never been built. My scientific ideas have never been proven.”

“But—” said Annie.

Leonardo went on: “For years, I made drawings of an enormous horse I planned to sculpt for the Duke of Milan. But in the end, that work came to nothing, too. I have finished only a few paintings. I cannot even finish my favorite one, a portrait of a lovely lady of Florence. Today my fresco in the hall of the great council was ruined. But always, in spite of all my failures, one thing brought me comfort.”

“What?” asked Jack.

“I knew someday I would be the first person in the world to fly,” said Leonardo. His voice quavered. “Talking with the two of you, I knew the time had finally come to test my machine.”

“We’re sorry,” said Annie.

“No, no, I had to test it sooner or later,” said Leonardo. “But now that dream, too, has come to nothing. I will never achieve fame by flying. I will never fly.” He hung his head and stared at the ground. “I shall go home now. I shall burn all my notebooks and my unfinished paintings and inventions. I shall leave Florence and never return.”

“Oh, no!” said Jack.

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “You will fly.”

“Annie,” Jack warned. Since the machine would never work, he didn’t want her to give Leonardo false hope.

“You are going to fly, Leonardo,” said Annie. “And you’re going to love it.”

“Annie, human flight isn’t possible at this time in history!” Jack whispered to Annie. “A person needs a motor. We don’t have a motor.”

But Annie paid no attention. “Hold on, everyone,” she said. “I have to get something.” She climbed into the cart and reached into Jack’s bag.

When Annie turned back around, Jack gasped. He had forgotten all about the Wand of Dianthus.

8. Wings!




Annie held up the wand. “Close your eyes, Leonardo,” she said.

Leonardo just shook his head.

“Please?” said Annie. “Just for a second?”

Leonardo put his head in his hands.

“Listen,” said Annie. “This morning you said that a great artist has to combine observation with imagination.”

Leonardo barely nodded.

“Well, watch out—because this is the imagination part!” said Annie. She waved the wand at Leonardo, then at herself and Jack. Counting her words on her fingers, she said in a loud, clear voice: “Make. Us. Fly. Like. Birds.”

Leonardo’s arms whipped out to his sides. They sprouted long grayish feathers. He let out a yelp. The next thing Jack knew, his arms had turned into feathery wings, too! So had Annie’s!

“What’s happening?” cried Leonardo.

“Wings!” said Annie.

Jack’s wings felt light and airy, yet strong and powerful.

“Now we can fly!” said Annie.

“Wings?” said Leonardo, looking stunned. Then he burst out laughing. “We have wings! We have wings! Run! Run into the wind!”

Jack, Annie, and Leonardo all stretched out their wings and took quick steps forward. The wind rushed under their feathers and lifted them off the ground.

“WHOOOAH!” cried Leonardo.

Leonardo, Jack, and Annie flapped their wings and soared high into the sky. Then they caught a gentle wind and stopped flapping. Twisting this way and that, they glided in a big circle above the countryside.

Jack felt as light as the wind. His heart beat wildly.

“Incredible, huh?” yelled Annie.

“Best flying ever!” shouted Jack.

Jack and Annie had flown lots before. They’d flown on a dragon, on a bicycle, on a winged lion, on a magic carpet, and on the back of a white stag in Camelot. They’d even flown as ravens over a haunted castle. But this was the first time they’d ever flown on their own, just as themselves.

“Follow me!” cried Leonardo. He tilted his wings and flew out of the circle. Jack and Annie flew after him. They all swooped high up over the quiet hills and glided through low clouds.

The cool, wet mist blew against Jack’s face. He felt as if he were swimming through the sky, as if the clouds were water keeping him afloat.

Laughing and whooping with delight, Leonardo led Jack and Annie out of the clouds and down over the yellow meadows and the pale green olive groves.

“Helloooo!” Leonardo shouted to farmers plowing a field. But the farmers didn’t look up.

“Helloooo!” he called to grape pickers working in a vineyard, but they didn’t look up, either.

No one on the ground looked up, but all the birds in the sky seemed to take notice. Birds cawed and swooped near them, as if welcoming them to their world. Birds flew alongside them and spread out in front of them, leading them over the city walls of Florence.

Jack, Annie, and Leonardo circled with the birds over the sea of red-tiled roofs, over the great dome of the cathedral, and over the bell tower of the palace of the great council.

“Florence looks so neat and orderly from up here!” Leonardo cried to Jack and Annie. “I wish I had my sketchbook!”



The city did look orderly from the sky, thought Jack: the busy market

with its rows of stalls and tents,

the narrow lanes with the brightly colored

clothes waving from clotheslines,

the long covered bridge,

the winding, sparkling river.

Jack, Annie, and Leonardo soared with the birds back over the city walls out to the countryside. They glided over the olive groves and vineyards. Then they circled above the spot where Leonardo’s Great Bird lay broken in the grass.

The birds swooped up and vanished behind the clouds. Leonardo, Jack, and Annie glided down toward the ground. They opened their wings wide and then, gently and easily, their feet touched the grass. Their wings fluttered with tiny beats, and the three of them took quick hopping steps before coming to a full stop.

When Jack, Annie, and Leonardo were steady on their feet, their long feathers disappeared and their bird wings became arms again. Leonardo looked dazed. He stared up at the sky. Then he staggered a few steps and fell facedown into the grass.

“Leonardo?” said Annie.

Oh, no, thought Jack. He’s had a heart attack.

“Leonardo?” said Annie. She knelt down near him.

Leonardo rolled over and stared up at Jack and Annie. “What … what just happened?” he stammered. “Did we fly? Did we really fly? Or was it a dream?”

“Uh … well …” Jack didn’t know what to say. To explain the wand to Leonardo, they’d have to start way back at the very beginning—with the tree house, Morgan, Merlin, Teddy, Kathleen, Dianthus. It would take forever.

“Well,” said Annie. “One day a long time ago, we were playing in the woods and we saw—”

“Annie—” Jack shook his head.

Annie frowned. “I guess it can’t really be explained,” she said.

Leonardo looked up at the sky. “No, no,” he said. “I think you are right. Perhaps some things should remain mysteries and are better kept in our hearts. We should not try to explain them.”

That’s an amazing statement, Jack thought, from a person who always tries to explain everything.

“But if I had to explain it, I would explain it this way,” said Leonardo. He leapt to his feet. “For years, I wrote down all my observations of bird flight. I made hundreds of drawings. These things helped me build my flying machine. But in the end, something was missing—something very important.”

“What?” asked Annie.

“The spirit of a bird!” said Leonardo. “A bird is not just a machine. A bird has a spirit. And with the two of you, I somehow gained that spirit. If only for a short time and if only in my imagination, we all became more bird than human!”

“And did the spirit of the bird mend your heart?” Annie asked.

Leonardo smiled. “Yes, my heart is mended now. I am ready to leave this dream behind and move on to others. And it does not matter that the world will never know of my great triumph.”

“So maybe fame isn’t the secret of happiness?” said Jack.

“Absolutely not,” said Leonardo. “I know that now. We must do what we do to satisfy our own hearts. For instance, I am working on a painting now. I love it. I do not care if others ever see it.… Oh! Oh, no! What time is it?” He jerked his head around to look at the sun. “I must go! I will be late!”

“Late for what?” said Annie.

“To meet my model at the studio!” said Leonardo. “The woman I am painting in the portrait I was just talking about! We must return!”

Jack, Annie, and Leonardo hurried back to the cart and climbed in. Leonardo snapped the reins, and the white horse started clopping back toward Florence.



9. The Smile




At first no one spoke on the trip back. It was as if they didn’t want to break the spell of joy that had settled over them. Even though Jack was bumping up and down in the cart, he could still remember the feeling of flying smoothly through the sky. He could feel the wind rustling his long feathers.

The cart passed through a gate in the city walls. As they started through the streets, Annie broke the silence. “So if fame is not the secret of happiness,” she said to Leonardo, “then what is? Do you think it could be flying?”

Leonardo thought for a moment. “No, no. The secret of happiness cannot be flying,” he said.

“Why not?” asked Jack.

“Because flying is a great dream that no one but us will ever realize,” said Leonardo. “Surely happiness cannot be only for us.”

“True,” said Annie.

“So what do you think the secret is?” asked Jack.

“Hmm …” Leonardo was silent. Then he sighed. “I must think about it,” he said.

Jack looked worriedly at the sky. The sun would go down soon and night would come. According to their rhyme, they were supposed to leave when the night bird sang its song. “Um … how long do you think it’ll take you to think about it?” Jack asked.

“I do not know,” said Leonardo. “Right now all I know is that I must hurry to meet with my model. She is already unhappy enough without my being late.”

“Why is she unhappy?” asked Annie.

“She will not say,” said Leonardo. “Perhaps she is tired of posing for me. For three years, she has been sitting for her portrait.”

“Whoa, that’s a really long time,” said Annie, “especially if you’re just sitting.”

“Yes, yes, it is,” said Leonardo. “Lately she will not even smile. She only stares at me sadly. I have tried hiring singers, musicians, and joke-sters to amuse her, but nothing helps.”

“Maybe you shouldn’t meet with her today,” said Jack. He didn’t want Leonardo to lose his good feelings from flying. And he wanted him to spend time thinking about the secret of happiness.

“No, I must,” said Leonardo. “The light is perfect today. Late afternoon is the best time for painting a portrait—in my courtyard, when the sunlight is golden and shadows are beginning to fall.”

Shadows were falling as the white horse pulled the cart into Leonardo’s courtyard. A young woman was standing by the studio door.

“Lisa!” called Leonardo.

“Hello, Leonardo,” the woman said. She wore a dark gown with a silk cloth over her shoulder. A thin veil covered her long brown hair. She had a high forehead and large brown eyes. Oddly, she looked like someone Jack knew, but he couldn’t remember who.

“Forgive me, Lisa. I am late,” said Leonardo, leaping down from the cart. “Will you wait for me to set up my things?”

“Yes, I will wait,” said Lisa.

Leonardo hurried inside, and Jack and Annie climbed down from the cart. “Hi, we’re Annie and Jack,” said Annie.

The woman smiled at them. “I am Lisa,” she said.

“You look familiar to me,” said Annie.

“Really?” said Lisa. “Are you from Florence?”

“No, we’re from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania,” said Annie. “It’s far away.”

Lisa smiled again. “I like the name of your town,” she said.

So Lisa did smile for other people, thought Jack. He wondered why she wouldn’t smile for Leonardo.

Leonardo came back outside, carrying a small canvas, an easel, and a paint box. He then brought out a stool for Lisa. She sat down and folded her hands.

Leonardo placed the canvas on his easel. As he prepared his paints, Jack and Annie looked at his painting-in-progress.

“Nice,” breathed Annie.

The small canvas showed the model, Lisa. Except for her mouth, her whole face had been painted. In the background was a misty landscape with mountains and winding rivers.

Leonardo picked up his brush, dipped it into a paint jar, and began to work. Jack and Annie watched closely as the great genius brushed a thin coat of green paint over the scenery.

“What are you doing now?” whispered Annie.

“I paint many very thin coats over the background,” murmured Leonardo. “This casts a soft green light over everything. So it all blends together like smoke, and you cannot tell light from shadow.”



“How’d you figure that out?” asked Annie. “I mean, you’re always coming up with new ways to do things. How do you do that?”

“I ask questions,” said Leonardo. “All the time, I ask questions: How can I paint the light? How can I capture the shadows? How can I do this? How can I do that?” Leonardo stopped painting. He put down his brush and looked at Jack and Annie. His eyes were sparkling. “And now, my friends, I know the secret.”

“You do?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Leonardo. “The secret of happiness is available to all of us, every hour of every day. Young, old, rich, poor—everyone can choose to find happiness in this way.”

“How?” asked Annie. “What’s the secret?” She and Jack leaned forward, eager to hear the answer.

“Curiosity,” said Leonardo.

“Curiosity?” repeated Jack. He had curiosity. He had lots of it.

“Always ask questions,” said Leonardo. “Always try to learn something new. Ask: Why? When? Where? What? Say: ‘I wonder what this means.’ ‘I wonder how that works.’ ‘I wonder what this person is like. And that person. And that one.’ I am always searching for answers to things I do not understand.”

“Me too!” said Jack.

“And so I look forward to each new day, each spring and summer and fall and winter, and all the months and years ahead, because there is so much to discover,” said Leonardo.

“Me too!” said Annie.

“Through my curiosity, I forget my failures and sorrows, and I feel great happiness,” said Leonardo. He looked up at the sky. “For instance, one might wonder how they built that eight-sided dome on top of the cathedral.”

“I do wonder that!” said Jack.

“And I wonder—what exactly makes the clouds change shape?” said Annie.

“And—and what makes bread crackly on the outside and soft on the inside?” asked Jack.

“Are there really just ten types of noses?” said Annie.

“How many kinds of ears are there?” said Jack. “How many kinds of feet?”

“Hands!” said Annie.

“Eyebrows!” said Jack.

Their two voices spilled over each other as they kept calling out questions: “And who rings the bells in the bell tower?” “Why is the sky blue?” “Where do city birds sleep?”

“AND WHY WON’T LISA SMILE FOR LEONARDO?” asked Annie.

Jack and Leonardo looked at Annie. Then they all turned and looked at Lisa. Jack had actually forgotten she was sitting near them.

The quiet, lovely woman blinked. “What?” she said. “What did you say?”

“Why won’t you smile for Leonardo, Lisa?” asked Annie. “Are you mad at him because you’ve been posing for three years?”

Lisa’s face grew red. She seemed to be fighting tears. She shook her head.

“Is—is there another reason?” Annie asked softly.

Lisa looked at Leonardo. He was staring back at her. “Yes,” she whispered. “There is.”

“What is it?” Annie asked.

“I am afraid to smile,” said Lisa. She kept staring at Leonardo, though she was talking to Annie. “If I smile, Leonardo will paint my smile, and he will be done with me. He will sell my portrait to my family and never think of me again.”

There was silence for a moment. Jack and Annie looked at Leonardo. “Annie,” said Leonardo finally, staring at Lisa. “Tell Lisa that if she will smile, I will finish her portrait. But tell her that I will not sell it to her family. I will carry it with me wherever I go, for the rest of my life, and I will never forget her.”

“Lisa, Leonardo says that—” started Annie.

But Lisa stopped her. “I heard,” she said softly. Then she smiled. It was a faint smile, but a mysterious and beautiful one. Her face glowed in the golden light of late afternoon.

“Ah!” gasped Leonardo. “Keep that smile,” he said. He kept staring at Lisa as he dipped his paintbrush into a jar. “Please! Keep that smile, Mona Lisa.”

Mona Lisa? Jack had heard the name Mona Lisa before.

Lisa kept smiling. Leonardo painted.

“Hey, listen,” Annie said to Jack.

Jack listened. He heard a bird whistling and trilling. A plain brown bird was singing from the rooftop above the courtyard.

“That looks like the bird you let out of the cage,” said Jack.

“It is him!” whispered Annie.

“He is a nightingale,” said Leonardo, keeping his eyes on Lisa. “A beautiful singer, yes?”

Annie smiled at Jack. “Time to go,” she said. “Remember Morgan’s rhyme—help the genius ‘Till the night bird sings its song.’ ”

“Right,” said Jack, sighing. “Good-bye, Leonardo.”

Leonardo didn’t seem to hear him.

“Good-bye, Lisa,” said Annie.

Lisa turned her eyes to look at Jack and Annie. “Bye,” she whispered.

Then Leonardo turned and looked at them, too. “Yes, good-bye, my friends!” he said. “Come again soon, please! You have been a great help to me today.”

“You helped us, too,” said Annie.

Leonardo bowed to them. Then he turned back to his work. He painted Lisa’s smile as the nightingale sang on. The bird’s song grew louder and louder, until it seemed to fill the Florence night.

10. Questions




It was twilight when Annie and Jack stepped back out into the street.

“Where’s the tree with the tree house?” asked Annie.

“Somewhere over the bridge beyond the big dome,” said Jack.

They kept their eyes on the dome as they threaded their way through the streets of Florence. When they came to the cathedral, the square was quiet. The cathedral’s great doors were open. Jack and Annie could see candles burning inside.

Jack and Annie kept walking and soon came to the market. The hundreds of tents and stalls were all closed for the night. The square was empty.

Jack and Annie returned the way they had come that morning. Walking down the same narrow lanes, they saw that all the shops were closed now, too. They crossed the covered bridge and walked along the flowing river, past quiet houses where smoke curled from chimneys into the darkening sky.

Finally Jack and Annie came to the hedge that hid the tree with the tree house. In the gray light of dusk, they climbed up the rope ladder.

“Before we go home, I want to look something up,” said Jack. He pulled their research book out of his bag and looked in the index for Mona Lisa. He found it and turned to the right page.

“Look! It’s Lisa!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie stared at a picture of Leonardo’s painting. It looked exactly the same, except now there was a smile on Lisa’s face, the same smile they’d just seen in real life. Jack read aloud:

Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of Mona Lisa is perhaps the most famous painting in the world. It is believed to be a portrait of Lisa del Gioconda. (The Italian word mona means “my lady.”) Leonardo da Vinci never sold the portrait of Lisa. He took it with him everywhere he traveled until he died.



Jack closed the book. “He kept his promise,” he said.

“I knew he would,” said Annie. She sighed. “Good-bye, Leonardo,” she whispered. Then she picked up their note from Morgan and pointed at the words Frog Creek. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Sunlight flooded through the tree house window. No time had passed in Frog Creek. The school bell was still ringing, announcing that class would start in ten minutes. Jack and Annie were wearing their school clothes. Jack’s cloth bag had changed back into his backpack.

“We have to hurry,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. He looked inside his pack. He was happy to see the Wand of Dianthus. As he pulled out their research book, a piece of paper fell out. It was the sketch of Leonardo’s angel.

“Oh, I forgot all about this,” said Jack. He and Annie looked at the sketch.

“It shows he was really a good drawer,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. “And it will remind us about Leonardo’s secret of happiness.”

“He was curious about everything,” said Annie. “Angels, noses, birds.”

“Feathers, flowers, wolves, and spiders,” added Jack.

“Shadows, light,” said Annie.

“Bells, clouds, the moon,” said Jack.

“And every time he was unhappy about something, his curiosity seemed to make him happy again,” said Annie.

Jack took the angel drawing from Annie and carefully put it back into his pack. “Come on,” he said. “We don’t want to be late for school.” Jack started down the rope ladder, and Annie followed.

Jack and Annie walked together through the sun-bright woods. “I wonder where my new class will be,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and I wonder where my desk will be. Close to the window? Or the door?”

“And will Randy and Jenny be in my class again this year?” said Annie.

“Will Joe be in mine?” said Jack.

“Whatever happened to Raymond Johnson?” asked Annie. “Is he coming back this year?”

“I hope so,” said Jack. “And who’s the new librarian? And the new music teacher?”

“Yeah, and what kind of noses do they have?” said Annie.

Jack laughed. All the questions about school didn’t make him nervous anymore. Now he was eager to find out the answers. He quickened his steps. “And how long will it take us to get there, if we walk really, really fast?” he said.



“What if we run?” said Annie.

Jack and Annie started running, as the wind blew through the trees and the leaves fluttered through the air and the birds sang from the branches in the Monday-morning woods.

More About Leonardo da Vinci




Leonardo da Vinci, (say lee-uh-NAR-doh duh VIN-chee) was born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy, just outside Florence. He died on May 2, 1519, in France.

Leonardo da Vinci lived in a time called the Renaissance (say REN-uh-sahns). Renaissance means “rebirth.” The time was given this name because in those years, learning and creativity reached new heights after a long period called the Middle Ages. The Renaissance began in Italy in the 1300s and then spread to other parts of Europe. Leonardo has always been the perfect example of the “Renaissance man,” which is a person who has many different talents. He was not only one of the world’s greatest painters, but he was also an inventor, mathematician, botanist, geologist, cook, musician, philosopher, engineer, and sculptor.

Monday with a Mad Genius was inspired by many true facts about Leonardo da Vinci, such as his reverse handwriting and his keeping of many notebooks. Historians think that his notebooks may have totaled as many as 13,000 pages, but only 7,000 pages of his writings and drawings have been found.

Leonardo really did begin painting a fresco of a vivid battle scene called The Battle of Anghiari in the hall of the great council in Florence. A fresco is a plaster painting on a wall or ceiling. The Battle of Anghiari was indeed damaged because Leonardo experimented with a new painting technique and parts of the painting melted down the wall. Sadly, he never finished it.

Leonardo really had a great interest in birds and flying. He wrote in one of his notebooks that a bird had visited him as a baby in his cradle. One of his earliest biographers wrote that Leonardo bought caged birds in the market and freed them. Leonardo’s notebooks had designs for a flying machine with flapping wings, which he called a “great bird.” Leonardo wrote that the “great bird” was about to take its first flight and would fill the universe with amazement and bring “eternal glory to the nest where it was born.” It was not recorded that his machine ever flew successfully. It is possible that he or an assistant may have tried to fly the plane and failed.

Leonardo really did take three or four years to paint one of the world’s most famous works of art, the Mona Lisa. And he really did keep the painting with him until he died. But no one knows—or will ever know—the real reason for the Mona Lisa’s mysterious smile.

Jack felt raindrops. He looked up and saw a summer storm cloud.

“Hurry!” Jack called to Annie. They were riding their bikes home from the library. Jack’s backpack was filled with library books. He didn’t want them to get wet.

As Jack and Annie pedaled faster, a large white bird swooped over them and flew into the Frog Creek woods.

“Did you see that?” cried Jack.

“A seagull!” called Annie. “It’s a sign!”

“You’re right!” said Jack. The last time they’d seen a seagull in Frog Creek, the magic tree house was waiting for them!

“The woods!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie bumped their bikes over the curb. The rain fell harder as they headed into the wet woods. Their bike tires bounced over the rough ground, crushing leaves and snapping twigs.

“It must be time to look for another secret of happiness for Merlin!” Jack called.

“I hope Merlin’s feeling better!” shouted Annie.

“I hope Teddy and Kathleen came with the tree house!” shouted Jack.

“Me too!” shouted Annie.

Jack and Annie steered their bikes under canopies of wet leaves. By the time they came to the tallest oak in the woods, the seagull had disappeared. But the magic tree house was back! It was high in the tallest oak, its rope ladder swaying in the wind and rain.

Jack and Annie climbed off their bikes and propped them against the trunk of the tree.

“Teddy! Kathleen!” Annie shouted.

There was no answer.

“I guess they didn’t come this time,” Jack said.

“Darn!” said Annie. “I really wanted to see them.”

“Boo!” Two older kids looked down out of the tree house window: a curly-haired boy with a big grin and a girl with sea-blue eyes and a beautiful smile. Both were wearing long green cloaks.

“Yay!” cried Annie and Jack.

The rain fell harder as they started up the rope ladder. When they climbed into the tree house, they yanked off their bike helmets and hugged Teddy and Kathleen.

“Morgan sent us to tell you about your next mission for Merlin,” said Teddy.

“How is Merlin?” asked Annie.

Teddy stopped smiling. He shook his head.

“Merlin still suffers from an unspoken sorrow,” Kathleen said sadly.

“When can we see him?” asked Annie.

“We’ve learned two secrets of happiness to share with him,” said Jack.

“You may visit him after you have learned two more secrets,” said Kathleen. “Morgan believes four is the magic number that will ensure success.”

“We have come to send you on your search for a third secret,” said Teddy.

Kathleen took a book from under her cloak and handed it to Jack and Annie. “From Morgan’s hands to our hands to yours,” she said.

Jack took the book from her. The cover showed waves crashing on a beach.



“Wow,” said Jack. “We’re going to the ocean?”

“Yes,” said Teddy. “That is where you will next search for a secret of happiness.”

“The ocean always makes me happy,” said Annie. “Once Jack and I traveled to a coral reef and swam with dolphins. And we ran into an octopus. But he was nice and shy and—”

“But the shark we saw wasn’t shy,” Jack broke in. “It was a big hammerhead.”

“Oh, my,” said Kathleen.

“We took a ride in a mini-sub,” said Annie. “It was so cool!”

“Until it started to leak and—” said Jack.

“We had to escape!” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “We tried not to splash—so the shark wouldn’t notice us.”

“We had so much fun!” said Annie.

Kathleen smiled. “Well, I hope you will not find the same ‘fun’ on this journey,” she said.

“But in case you do, you have your wand to help you, do you not?” asked Teddy. “The Wand of Dianthus?”

“Of course,” said Jack. “I always carry it, just in case.” Jack reached into his backpack and pulled out the silvery wand. It was shaped like the spiraled horn of a unicorn.

“You remember the three rules?” asked Kathleen.

“Sure,” said Jack. “To make magic, we use a wish with only five words.”

“And before we use the wand, we have to try our hardest,” said Annie.

“And the wand can only be used for the good of others,” said Jack, “not just ourselves.”

“Exactly,” said Teddy.

“I wonder who the ‘others’ will be on this mission,” said Annie. She looked at Teddy and Kathleen. “Maybe you guys?”

“I fear not,” said Kathleen. “You must find the third secret on your own.”

“Just remember to keep your wits about you,” said Teddy.

“And listen to your hearts,” said Kathleen.

“Okay,” said Annie. “We’ll tell you all about it when we see you again.”

Lightning flashed through the woods as Jack pointed to the cover of the ocean book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

Thunder cracked in the dark sky. The wind blew harder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

For three years of my childhood, my family lived right on the ocean. Our windows were always covered with sea spray from the waves splashing on the rocks beneath the house. You might think I spent every summer playing in the water. But sadly, I was afraid of the ocean. I was convinced that sea creatures would grab me, sting me, swish against me, bite me, or drown me. (Sometimes having too much imagination can be a problem!)

I did try very hard to overcome my fear. Many times I waded in cautiously—wearing my sneakers!—one step at a time. I wish I could tell you that one day I got up the courage and just dove in and was never afraid again. But alas, I never managed to get in past my knees.

Only as a grown-up did I realize that the creatures of the sea were probably more afraid of me than I was of them. Since learning this, I have not been afraid—in fact, I’ve gone snorkeling in the waters of the Caribbean and have swum with dolphins off the coast of Mexico. My fear of ocean life has been replaced with great wonder and respect. I hope by the time you finish this book, you’ll feel the same.

For Elyot and Beatrice Harmston





“The sea, once it casts its spell, holds

one in its net of wonder forever.”

—Jacques Cousteau





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history: Venice, Baghdad, Paris, and New York City. After proving to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he awarded them the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that would help them make their own magic.

On their last two adventures, Teddy and Kathleen told Jack and Annie that Merlin was very unhappy and not well and that Morgan wanted them to search for four secrets of happiness to share with Merlin.

Now Jack and Annie are waiting for the tree house to return and take them on their third mission to help Merlin….



1. Back to the Sea

Jack felt raindrops. He looked up and saw a summer storm cloud.

“Hurry!” Jack called to Annie. They were riding their bikes home from the library. Jack’s backpack was filled with library books. He didn’t want them to get wet.

As Jack and Annie pedaled faster, a large white bird swooped over them and flew into the Frog Creek woods.

“Did you see that?” cried Jack.

“A seagull!” called Annie. “It’s a sign!”

“You’re right!” said Jack. The last time they’d seen a seagull in Frog Creek, the magic tree house was waiting for them!

“The woods!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie bumped their bikes over the curb. The rain fell harder as they headed into the wet woods. Their bike tires bounced over the rough ground, crushing leaves and snapping twigs.

“It must be time to look for another secret of happiness for Merlin!” Jack called.

“I hope Merlin’s feeling better!” shouted Annie.

“I hope Teddy and Kathleen came with the tree house!” shouted Jack.

“Me too!” shouted Annie.

Jack and Annie steered their bikes under canopies of wet leaves. By the time they came to the tallest oak in the woods, the seagull had disappeared. But the magic tree house was back! It was high in the tallest oak, its rope ladder swaying in the wind and rain.

Jack and Annie climbed off their bikes and propped them against the trunk of the tree.

“Teddy! Kathleen!” Annie shouted.

There was no answer.

“I guess they didn’t come this time,” Jack said.

“Darn!” said Annie. “I really wanted to see them.”

“Boo!” Two older kids looked down out of the tree house window: a curly-haired boy with a big grin and a girl with sea-blue eyes and a beautiful smile. Both were wearing long green cloaks.

“Yay!” cried Annie and Jack.

The rain fell harder as they started up the rope ladder. When they climbed into the tree house, they yanked off their bike helmets and hugged Teddy and Kathleen.

“Morgan sent us to tell you about your next mission for Merlin,” said Teddy.

“How is Merlin?” asked Annie.

Teddy stopped smiling. He shook his head.

“Merlin still suffers from an unspoken sorrow,” Kathleen said sadly.

“When can we see him?” asked Annie.

“We’ve learned two secrets of happiness to share with him,” said Jack.

“You may visit him after you have learned two more secrets,” said Kathleen. “Morgan believes four is the magic number that will ensure success.”

“We have come to send you on your search for a third secret,” said Teddy.

Kathleen took a book from under her cloak and handed it to Jack and Annie. “From Morgan’s hands to our hands to yours,” she said.

Jack took the book from her. The cover showed waves crashing on a beach.



“Wow,” said Jack. “We’re going to the ocean?”

“Yes,” said Teddy. “That is where you will next search for a secret of happiness.”

“The ocean always makes me happy,” said Annie. “Once Jack and I traveled to a coral reef and swam with dolphins. And we ran into an octopus. But he was nice and shy and—”

“But the shark we saw wasn’t shy,” Jack broke in. “It was a big hammerhead.”

“Oh, my,” said Kathleen.

“We took a ride in a mini-sub,” said Annie. “It was so cool!”

“Until it started to leak and—” said Jack.

“We had to escape!” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “We tried not to splash—so the shark wouldn’t notice us.”

“We had so much fun!” said Annie.

Kathleen smiled. “Well, I hope you will not find the same ‘fun’ on this journey,” she said.

“But in case you do, you have your wand to help you, do you not?” asked Teddy. “The Wand of Dianthus?”

“Of course,” said Jack. “I always carry it, just in case.” Jack reached into his backpack and pulled out the silvery wand. It was shaped like the spiraled horn of a unicorn.

“You remember the three rules?” asked Kathleen.

“Sure,” said Jack. “To make magic, we use a wish with only five words.”

“And before we use the wand, we have to try our hardest,” said Annie.

“And the wand can only be used for the good of others,” said Jack, “not just ourselves.”

“Exactly,” said Teddy.

“I wonder who the ‘others’ will be on this mission,” said Annie. She looked at Teddy and Kathleen. “Maybe you guys?”

“I fear not,” said Kathleen. “You must find the third secret on your own.”

“Just remember to keep your wits about you,” said Teddy.

“And listen to your hearts,” said Kathleen.

“Okay,” said Annie. “We’ll tell you all about it when we see you again.”

Lightning flashed through the woods as Jack pointed to the cover of the ocean book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

Thunder cracked in the dark sky. The wind blew harder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Pirates Again?

Jack opened his eyes. Teddy and Kathleen were gone. The warm air was filled with mist.

Jack and Annie peered out the window together. The tree house had landed in a tall tree with spreading branches. The mist was so thick they couldn’t see anything around them. But Jack heard the caws of gulls and the swooshing of rolling waves. He smelled salt water and seaweed.

“The ocean’s out there. Feel it?” said Annie.

“I hear it and smell it,” said Jack.

“Then let’s go play in it!” said Annie. She pulled off her sneakers and socks.

“We can’t just play,” Jack said. “We have to look for a secret of happiness.”

“Well, I’m happiest when I’m playing in the ocean!” Annie started down the rope ladder.

I’m sure our mission’s harder than that, Jack thought. He took their library books out of his pack and replaced them with the deep-sea book.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

Jack put on his pack and started down after her. He stepped off the ladder onto the misty ground.

“Come on!” said Annie.

Jack followed Annie toward the sounds of seabirds and waves. They walked through feathery ferns and climbed a sloping sand dune. When they rounded the top, Jack saw waves rolling onto a wide, sandy beach. But the ocean itself was still shrouded in a gray haze.

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“Come on, let’s go in,” Annie said.

Jack and Annie hurried down the dune and ran toward the ocean. While Annie waded into the water, Jack stood at the edge and pulled out their research book. “Listen to this, Annie,” he called.

Jack read loudly:

Water covers three-quarters of our earth. Most of the ocean is an enormous plain a little more than two miles deep. But some ocean trenches are more than six miles deep.



“More than six miles?” Annie asked, splashing the water with her hands. “It’s six miles from our house to Aunt Libby’s.”

“I know,” said Jack. He read more:

The ocean is home to thousands and thousands of sea creatures. Mountains and volcanoes are also hidden deep beneath the surface of the sea.



“Mountains and volcanoes?” asked Annie. “Under the water?”

“That’s what the book says,” said Jack. “The ocean’s a whole world we don’t know anything about.”

“Well, some people know about it,” said Annie. “Or that book couldn’t have been written.”

Good point, thought Jack.

“Put the book away and come in, Jack,” said Annie. “The sun’s coming out!”

Jack looked up from his book. The sun was burning away the mist, making the day hotter.

“Let’s go swimming!” said Annie.

As Annie dove into a wave, Jack put his book back into his backpack. He left his pack on the beach, then he waded into the water.

“Great, huh?” called Annie.

“Yeah,” Jack said as he dug his toes into the soft, gooey sand. Cool seawater lapped around his calves. He felt the warm sunshine on his face.

“Let’s swim farther out,” said Annie. “Maybe the secret of happiness is in the deep sea.”

“How do we go down there without a submarine?” asked Jack.



“The wand,” said Annie. “Maybe it will turn us into fish or something.”

Jack closed his eyes and pictured the darkness of the deep filled with thousands of weird creatures. “But the wand can be used only after we’ve tried our hardest. I don’t think we’ve done that yet,” he said.

“Oh, right,” said Annie. “Plus, it has to be for the good of others.”

“So first we have to find some others,” Jack said, his eyes still closed.

“Jack, you won’t believe it,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack asked dreamily.

“Take a look!” said Annie.

Jack sighed and opened his eyes. The mist had cleared a bit, and the day was becoming bright and hot.

“I think we just found the others!” said Annie. She pointed out to sea.

Jack shaded his eyes and squinted. Through the wavy sunlight, he saw a large wooden ship with three tall masts. “Whoa,” he breathed. “That’s a ship from a long time ago.”

“Yeah. Remember when we ran into the pirate ship?” said Annie. “This ship looks the same, doesn’t it?”

“Oh, no,” said Jack. “Pirates again?”

“Look! A rowboat’s leaving the ship,” said Annie.

“Oh, man …,” said Jack.

“It’s heading toward us,” said Annie. “Just like that other time, remember? The pirates came ashore and chased us. Remember Pinky, Stinky, and Captain Bones?”

“Don’t panic,” said Jack, panicking. He splashed out of the water and ran up on the beach.

“Where should we go?” asked Annie, hurrying after him.

“To the tree house!” said Jack. He grabbed his backpack.

“But the pirates climbed up to the tree house,” said Annie. “Pinky and Stinky found—”

“Forget Pinky and Stinky!” said Jack. “Let’s just get out of here!”

Jack and Annie charged toward the sand dune. They raced up over the top and ran through the tall ferns and grass until they came to the rope ladder.

“Up, up!” cried Jack.

Jack and Annie climbed into the tree house. “Pull up the ladder!” said Jack. Together they hauled the rope ladder after them.

“Where’s the Pennsylvania book?” said Jack. He looked around wildly for the book that always took them home. He grabbed it and found a picture of Frog Creek.

“Wait, wait! Don’t make a wish yet!” said Annie. She was looking out the window. “I’m not so sure these guys are pirates.”

Clutching the Pennsylvania book to his chest, Jack looked out the window with Annie. There were three men in the rowboat. The boat rode the top of a wave and came close to the beach.

Two of the men scrambled out and dragged the boat from the shallow water onto the sand. They both wore huge, bulky vests over white puffy-sleeved shirts. They wore round white hats and white pants rolled up to their knees.

“Those two don’t look at all like Pinky and Stinky,” said Annie.

“You’re right,” said Jack. “Pirates never wear such clean-looking clothes.”

“And look at that third guy,” said Annie.

The third man stepped out of the boat, carrying a butterfly net. He pulled off his bulky vest, revealing an old-fashioned suit and a bow tie.

“He definitely doesn’t look like a pirate,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “He looks like he’s never been on a boat before in his life.”

As the two sailors pulled the rowboat farther onto the beach, the man in the bow tie picked up a stick. He started poking at clumps of seaweed.

“What’s he doing?” asked Jack.



The man dropped his stick and picked up something small from the sand. He studied it for a moment. Then he knelt down, pulled a small book out of his pocket, and started to write.

“Who is he?” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But one thing’s for sure—pirates don’t carry butterfly nets or write in notebooks.”

“You’re right,” said Jack. He put down the Pennsylvania book. “So what’s going on?”

“Let’s go find out,” said Annie. She dropped the rope ladder back to the ground and started down.

Jack grabbed his pack and hurried after her. Together they ran barefoot over the hot sand and through the feathery ferns. They climbed to the top of a sand dune and looked down. The three men were still at the edge of the water while the big ship drifted offshore.

“Hey, look. You can see the name of the ship,” said Annie.

Jack peered through the haze and read on the side of the ship, HMS Challenger. “I’ll look it up,” he whispered. He pulled out their research book and searched the index. “It’s here!” he whispered. He found the right page and read:

The HMS Challenger (HMS stands for Her Majesty’s Ship) was a British navy vessel that served as the first dedicated scientific exploration ship in the history of the world.



“Oh, man,” said Jack, looking up. “That is so cool.”

“Yeah, read more,” whispered Annie. Jack read on:

From 1872 to 1876, the HMS Challenger circled the globe, exploring the dark depths of the ocean. There were over 200 seamen and six scientists on board.



“So we landed in the 1870s,” said Jack, looking up again.

“And that guy with the butterfly net must be one of the scientists,” said Annie. “Come on, let’s go meet him!”

Before Jack could tell her to wait, Annie darted down the sand dune. “Hey, guys!” she called. She waved her arms. “Hi!”

The three men whirled around. Their eyes grew wide and their mouths dropped open. They looked at Annie as if they were staring at a ghost.


3. A Creature Named Henry


Jack threw their book into his pack and quickly ran to join Annie. “Hi,” he said to the three men.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. “We come in peace.”

The three men kept gawking. “Who—who are you?” one of the sailors sputtered.

Jack and Annie walked closer. “I’m Jack, and this is Annie,” said Jack.

The man in the bow tie stepped forward. He had a long mustache and a big, friendly smile. “My name is Henry,” he said. “I came ashore to look for rare butterflies, plants, and shells. But it seems I have found a rare creature called a Jack-and-Annie instead.”

“And we’ve found a creature called a Henry,” said Annie, giggling. “That’s what we named a pteranodon when we went to the time of the dinosaurs.”

“I beg your pardon?” said Henry.

“Uh … she’s teasing,” said Jack.

“What an unusual wit,” said Henry, his eyes sparkling. “Well, you have not only found a Henry. You’ve also found a Joe and a Tommy, the two able seamen who rowed me here.”

“Hi, Joe and Tommy,” said Annie. She gave the two sailors a big smile.

But Joe and Tommy didn’t smile back. They were both scowling. “Where are you from?” Joe asked suspiciously.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvania,” said Annie.

“Where is that?” asked Tommy.

“America,” said Jack.

“How nice!” said Henry. “Why are you here?”

“We, uh … we’re on vacation,” said Annie. “We’re camped with our family back there somewhere….” She waved vaguely.

“Vacation?” said Henry.

“Our parents like to vacation in really out-of-the-way places,” said Annie.

Henry chuckled. “Americans!”

“Are you a scientist from the HMS Challenger?” Jack said. He was eager to change the subject.

“Why, yes,” said Henry. “I am one of the team trying to solve the riddles of the deep.”

Jack loved the sound of that: riddles of the deep. “What kind of riddles have you solved so far?” he asked.

“Well, for one thing, we’ve learned that the ocean floor is absolutely teeming with life,” said Henry.

“You didn’t already know that?” asked Annie.

“We thought it was probably the case,” said Henry. “But mind you, many people cannot imagine that life can exist in the icy darkness of the deep. In fact, some still believe there is no floor to the ocean at all! They think the sea goes down forever.”

“Are you serious?” said Annie. “Ha. I guess you’ll be letting them know that most of the ocean is not more than two miles deep. Of course, some ocean trenches are deeper than six miles. But—”

“Annie …,” said Jack.

“My, you know a lot about the sea,” said Henry, looking at Annie with curiosity.

“Well, I know that mountain ranges and volcanoes are down there, too,” said Annie.

Jack leaned in close to Annie. “Stop showing off,” he said under his breath.

“Um … I mean maybe, just maybe,” Annie said to Henry. “Of course, I’m only guessing.”

“You are a very good guesser,” said Henry. “On our voyage, we’ve collected many volcanic rocks from the deep.”

“Cool,” said Annie. “How’d you get them? Mini-subs?”

“Mini-subs?” asked Henry.

“You know, they carry you down into the deep sea,” said Annie.

“Annie!” said Jack between his teeth. He gave her a look that said Just stop! Jack was pretty sure mini-subs hadn’t been invented by the early 1870s. He quickly changed the subject again. “And you study butterflies, too?” he said, pointing to Henry’s net. “And seashells?”

“Indeed I do,” said Henry. “In fact, I came ashore to search for a rare shell just now. And I think I may have found its cousin.” He opened his book to a page that showed a pencil drawing of the shell.

“Would you like us to help you look for more?” asked Annie.



“Why, thank you,” said Henry. “But I have quite successfully found what I came for. We’ll be going back to the ship now.”

“Oh, please, can we visit the HMS Challenger?” Annie blurted out.

“Out of the question,” said the sailor named Joe.

“Well, I’m—” said Henry.

“Sir, the captain would never approve of bringing children on board,” Tommy broke in. “It’s absolutely against the rules.”

Henry looked at Jack and Annie. Jack didn’t want to break any rules, but at the same time, he really wanted to visit the ship. “We’d really like to learn more about sea exploration,” he said. He gave the scientist a hopeful smile.

“We promise not to get in anyone’s way,” said Annie. “And our parents like us to learn new things.”

Henry turned back to the two seamen. “Surely such bright and curious young people should be allowed to visit our ship,” he said. “Since we’ll be drifting and dredging in this area all day, we can return them to shore before nightfall.”

Joe and Tommy frowned at each other. But Joe finally gave a quick nod.

“Yay!” Annie said.

“Thanks!” said Jack. “We promise we won’t cause any trouble.”

“See that you don’t,” said Henry with a smile. “Joe and Tommy, would you mind lending our two visitors your life preservers?”

“Never fit ’em, sir,” said Joe.

“Well, we must do what we can to keep them safe,” said Henry.

The two seamen grudgingly handed Jack and Annie their bulky vests.

So these are old-fashioned life preservers! thought Jack. The vests were made of blocks of cork tied together. Even though Jack buckled his tightly, it hung low on his body, almost slipping off.

“I’m afraid they are rather big,” said Henry, “but still they might save you should we capsize.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “We’re really good swimmers.”

“We should go now, sir,” Joe said impatiently.

“Yes, yes,” Henry said. “Let us be off!”

Joe and Tommy pushed the rowboat into the shallow water. While Jack and Annie had been talking with Henry, the water had turned choppy. Dark gray clouds had rolled in, hiding the sun.

“Climb in after me!” Henry told Jack and Annie, and they followed him into the rowboat.

Jack’s backpack wouldn’t fit over his life jacket. So he clutched the pack to his chest as Joe and Tommy pushed the boat farther into the ocean. The sailors jumped in, picked up their oars, and began rowing back to the ship.



4. Off the Ship!

“The wind’s against us!” Joe said as he and Tommy rowed.

Even after the boat moved past the breakers, it kept bouncing up and down on the swell of the waves. Water splashed over the sides and soaked Jack’s clothes. But Jack wasn’t worried about the wind or water. He was worried about being seasick, because waves of nausea had started to come over him.

“Sorry it’s a bit of tough going!” Henry said.

“We can take it!” Annie said.

We hope, thought Jack. The last thing he wanted to do was throw up, especially in front of Joe and Tommy!

“We should get back just in time to see the men haul up this morning’s catch!” said Henry.

“This is so much fun!” said Annie, her eyes shining as the little rowboat bobbed up and down.

Jack wasn’t having any fun at all. To keep from being sick, he gripped his backpack, closed his eyes, and gritted his teeth.

“Every day we make new discoveries,” said Henry. “Off the coast of Argentina, we found over one hundred new species! Giant worms several feet long! Shrimp the size of lobsters! Caught them in our nets, didn’t we, Joe?”

“Aye,” said Joe as he pulled on the oars. “But the creature that’s never been caught is the one these mates should be worried about!”

“What creature is that?” asked Annie.

“The great monster,” answered Tommy.

Jack opened his eyes. “What? You mean like a shark?” he asked.

“No, no, lad, ’tis much worse than any shark, even the twenty-foot tiger shark that’s been following us,” said Tommy. The sailor blinked nervously.

Whoa, twenty-foot tiger shark?! thought Jack. He looked at the dark water for a shark fin.

“Aye! This monster’s much bigger than any shark!” shouted Joe. “They say it looks like a cross between a dragon and a gigantic starfish.”

“Nay, more like a floating nest of snakes, mate,” said Tommy with a shudder. “They say it’ll curl around your body and strangle you to death!”

“A floating nest of snakes?” Annie asked.

Jack gulped. He turned to Henry. “Have you seen the monster?” he asked the scientist.

Henry shook his head. “I’ve never seen it,” he said. “But a few of our crewmen claim to have glimpsed something monstrous in these waters just yesterday.”

“Don’t be scared, mates!” said Joe. “If we see a monster, we’ll hurl our harpoons at ’im!”

“We’ll shoot ’im with our cannons!” said Tommy. He and Joe laughed loudly.

Maybe the sailors on the ship are just trying to scare the scientists, Jack thought hopefully. Why else would they be laughing?

When they reached the HMS Challenger, the rowboat drew alongside the big ship, rocking on the water. Jack gripped his pack tighter as more waves of seasickness washed over him.

“You go first, mate!” Joe said to Jack. “You’re looking a bit green.”

Clutching his pack under one arm, Jack grabbed the sides of the ladder. He held on tightly and climbed from the wooden hull of the ship up to the top deck. Annie came after him, then Henry, Joe, and Tommy. When they were all on the deck, the two seamen hauled up the row-boat.



Jack took a long, deep breath. Though the large ship rocked in the wind, it wasn’t nearly as bad as the small rowboat’s movement on the waves. Looking around the deck, Jack saw teams of sailors working. Some were coiling thick ropes. Others were hauling up strange-looking buckets.

Jack turned to ask Henry what the sailors were doing. But Henry was staring at a tall man in a white uniform and a heavyset older man in a dark suit who were walking briskly toward them. The two men were frowning.

“Oh, no,” murmured Henry. “Prepare to meet thy doom.”

“Who are they?” asked Annie.

Before Henry could answer, the man in white shouted, “What have you done this time, Mr. Moseley?”

Jack moved closer to Annie. He clutched his pack to his life vest.

“Well, Captain, I—” started Henry.

“Goodness, what have you brought up from the sea now, Henry?” the portly man asked. “A four-legged, four-armed creature of the deep?”

“Yes, Professor. It’s a Jack-and-Annie from America,” said Henry. “I found the creature vacationing on the island.”

The portly man smiled. “Oh, I see. I thought perhaps it was the monster that was sighted by some of the men yesterday.”

The monster again! thought Jack.

“This ship is not a place for children, Mr. Moseley,” the captain said gruffly.

“Yes, I know, sir,” said Henry. “But these two are extraordinary. They hardly seem like children at all. They’re quite independent and have great knowledge of the sea. I thought it might be permissible to bring them aboard for the afternoon and then return them to shore.”

“I’m afraid it goes against all the ship’s rules,” said the captain.

“It’s not Henry’s fault, Captain,” Annie piped up. “We begged him to let us visit your ship.”

“Ah, did you now?” the portly man asked, his eyes twinkling. “Why is that?”

“We love the ocean!” said Annie.

“And we’d really like to learn more about sea exploration, sir,” said Jack.

“Well, you’ve come to the right place!” said the man. “Allow me to introduce myself. I am Professor Thomson, the scientific director of the Challenger.”

“The professor is one of the world’s most renowned experts on the ocean,” said Henry.

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Well, I don’t know about that,” the professor said modestly. But he put his thumbs in his vest and began speaking as if he were giving a lecture. “Since the beginning of time, the secrets of the deep have been hidden from us. But now, with our expedition, we have learned many things.”

“Like what?” asked Jack.

“We have used miles and miles of steel wire to measure the depth of the sea,” said the professor. “We have lowered thermometers to measure temperatures in the deep. But perhaps most important of all, we are learning about the amazing creatures who live in the dark regions far beneath the ocean waves—”

“That is all well and good, Professor,” the captain broke in. “But I want these children off this ship immediately! Before the weather gets worse. Do you hear, Mr. Moseley? Off the ship!”


5. Ooze


The captain turned and strode away.

“Sorry, friends,” Henry said to Jack and Annie. “But the captain’s in charge.” He looked around. “I see Joe and Tommy are helping the men bring up the catch now. As soon as they are free, I will ask them to take you back to shore. I am very sorry.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “You did what you could.”

“Before you young people leave, perhaps you would like to see today’s specimens?” asked the professor.

“Sure!” said Jack and Annie together.

“Then come along!” said the professor. “Every single day we make new discoveries!”

Hurrying with Annie across the deck, Jack couldn’t wait to see what had just been brought up from the deep. They followed Henry and the professor to a team of sailors pulling up large nets. The nets were shaped like giant bags with mops attached to the bottom.

“What are those mops for?” asked Annie.

“They sweep up sea animals from the floor of the ocean,” explained Henry.

“We pull them from pitch-darkness into the light of day,” said the professor.

“That must scare them!” said Annie.

But the professor didn’t seem to hear her. “Over the years, we’ve hauled up tens of thousands of specimens!” he said.

As the sailors dumped the bags onto the deck, Jack saw mostly mud. But lying in the mud were tiny, squirmy pink and yellow fish and fiery orange sea stars.

“No monsters there, huh?” asked Annie.

The professor looked at her. “Not today, my dear,” he said.

“I was just kidding,” said Annie. “Do you believe in monsters?”

“Oh. Well …” The professor looked serious. “The sea is very deep, my dear. It covers nearly three-quarters of the world. So I say to myself, ‘Might it not indeed hold many mysterious creatures, including monsters?’”

Good point, thought Jack.

“But don’t be afraid, children!” said the professor. “Someday we’ll catch all the monsters and study them! We will conquer our fears through knowledge! Won’t we, Henry?”

“Yes, sir,” said Henry.

“Conquer our fears through knowledge!” The professor repeated his thought with enthusiasm. “I shall add that to my lectures.”

Low thunder rolled in the sky.

Jack looked up. Black clouds hovered overhead. A strong gust of wind swept over the deck.

“Attention!” the captain shouted, heading toward them. “A squall is headed our way! For now, take the children below to the main deck.”

“Yes, sir!” said Henry. He smiled at Jack and Annie. “Well, friends, I suppose you get to stay with us a while longer, after all.”

“Yay!” Annie said softly.

“Only those on watch stay on deck!” the captain shouted to his crew. “Everyone else get below.”

Henry led Jack and Annie away just as the rain began to pour down. Water dripped from Jack’s hair and backpack and life vest as he and Annie followed Henry down a steep flight of stairs to a dimly lit hallway.

“Our ship was converted from a war vessel to a ship of sea laboratories,” Henry said. “The navy removed sixteen of the eighteen guns on board to make room for them. Would you like to see mine?”

“Oh, yes!” said Jack. He couldn’t wait to see an actual sea laboratory.

“Follow me.” Henry unlocked a door and showed Jack and Annie into a large, dim room. There was a small skylight overhead. Rain pounded against the glass.

Henry struck a match and lit a couple of oil lamps. Shadows danced around the room.

Jack smiled and let out a deep sigh. He loved the sea lab. Shelves were lined with hundreds of different-size bottles. The bottles were filled with floating blobs. In the middle of the room was a wooden table. It held maps, rulers, thermometers, bowls with gooey-looking stuff, and a big microscope.

Henry pointed at the microscope. “Would you like to see something remarkable?” he asked.

“Oh, yes!” said Annie. She peered through the eyepiece. “Whoa—that’s amazing,” she breathed.

“Let me see,” said Jack. He put his backpack down on the table and looked in the microscope. He saw the tiny skeleton of a sea horse. “Cool …,” he said.

“That sea horse is no bigger than a grain of sugar,” said Henry. “But of course I’m fascinated by larger creatures as well. Why, just yesterday I spent several hours studying the ear bone of a dolphin and the tooth of a shark.”

“And what’s in all those bottles?” asked Annie. She pointed at the rows and rows of bottles on Henry’s shelves.

“Many curiosities,” said the scientist. “That large one, for instance, holds a creature that looks like a giant sock. Some call it a blubber fish. But it’s not a fish at all! It is made up of millions of tiny sea creatures.”

“Eww,” said Annie.

“And there’s a rare sea slug,” said Henry. He pointed to a bright yellow blob floating in a clear liquid.

“Nice color,” said Jack.

“We study whatever we bring up from the deep,” said Henry. “We measure the specimens and identify them. Then we preserve them in bottles of alcohol and label the bottles.”

“So all those bottles are full of dead sea creatures?” said Annie.

“Oh, no. Many bottles are simply filled with ooze from the bottom of the sea,” said Henry.



“Ooze?” said Jack.

“The official name for mud,” said Henry, smiling. “Here, feel it.” Henry picked up one of the plates on the table and held it out to Jack and Annie. They rubbed the sticky, wet mud between their fingers.

“Ooze is a good name for it,” said Jack.

Henry gave them a cloth to wipe their hands. Then he picked up a large book from the table. “And here is the notebook where I transfer my drawings of natural history specimens,” he said. He opened the book. Inside were beautiful watercolors of shells, plants, and butterflies.

“These are great,” said Jack. Henry’s notebook reminded him of the notebooks he’d seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s studio.

“This is beautiful,” said Annie. She reached across Henry’s table and picked up a gleaming, round seashell. The shell was white with curved reddish brown lines.

“Yes,” Henry said softly. “My nautilus shell.”

“Is this one of your specimens?” asked Annie.

“No,” said Henry. “I don’t consider that a specimen. It’s more like a treasure. I’m afraid I grew quite fond of the little creature who once lived inside that shell.”

“What did he do?” asked Annie.

“Oh, he just swam around a small tub I had for him,” said Henry. “But he moved backwards. Rather funny. He filled himself with water and then squirted it out—all over me!” Henry smiled. “I was quite sad when he died. I wished I had returned him to the sea.” Henry put the shell down and let out a quiet sigh. “Silly to think that way, I know.”

“Not silly at all,” said Annie.

The ship’s bell rang.

“Ah, time to go,” said Henry. “The captain runs a tight ship. It’s against the rules to be late. So let us be off to the wardroom.”

“What’s the wardroom?” Jack asked.

“That’s where the scientists and naval officers eat,” said Henry.

“Eat?” Jack said weakly. The thought of food made him feel queasy again.

“Yes,” said Henry. He blew out the two oil lamps. “Come along! You must join us! It’s lunchtime!”



6. Pea Soup

Henry led Jack and Annie out of the sea lab, locking the door behind them. Then he led the way through the hall and down another flight of steep steps. In the faint light of the lower deck, Jack saw naval officers and scientists streaming through a door ahead. He, Annie, and Henry lined up behind them and filed into the wardroom.

Still wearing their bulky life vests, Jack and Annie sat awkwardly on a long bench in front of a table. Many of the men stared at them with curiosity. The professor smiled, but the captain did not look happy.

“I thought our friends might join us for lunch, sir,” Henry said to the captain. “I promise they will return to shore after the storm.”

“Very well,” said the captain. “Immediately after the storm.”

“Aye, aye, sir,” said Henry. He turned to the other officers at the table. “Gentlemen, may I introduce Annie and Jack from America. They are adventurous travelers.”

“Hi,” murmured Jack and Annie.

The officers and scientists nodded politely.

Sailors in white uniforms acted as waiters, bringing plates and cups to the table. “What are we having for lunch?” Annie whispered to Henry.

“The usual,” said Henry, sighing. “Salted meat, pickles, dried biscuits.”

This is not good, thought Jack. He was right. When he was served, he could hardly look at his food, much less eat it. He was thirsty, though. So he reached for his cup and took a long sip of water.

Jack immediately spit the liquid back into his cup. It was unbelievably sour! He gagged and coughed. When he looked up, everyone was staring at him, including the captain. “Excuse me,” Jack said, wiping his mouth. His face felt hot from embarrassment.

“You just guzzled your lime juice, lad,” said the professor. “Most of us take it in small sips.”

“Lime juice?” asked Annie. “Why?”

“It prevents scurvy,” said the Professor. “Every day we all drink a cup of lime juice for vitamin C. Otherwise, we’d get sores and rotten teeth.”

“Yuck,” said Annie.

Henry smiled. “You won’t get scurvy if you eat fruits and vegetables,” he said. “But it is hard to keep vegetables and fruits fresh on board a ship.”

Jack couldn’t think about eating or drinking anything at the moment. All of it—especially the pickles—made him feel even queasier. The rolling of the ship didn’t help, either. “The waves seem to be getting worse,” he said to Henry.

“They do indeed,” said Henry. He turned and looked out a small, round window. “Can’t see a thing. It’s as thick as pea soup out there.”

Oh, no, Jack groaned to himself. Please don’t talk about pea soup.

The ship lurched. Cups and plates slid across the table and crashed to the floor. Annie grabbed Jack as the ship rocked wildly.

“Steady as she goes!” said the captain.

“It seems the storm is fully upon us,” said the professor.

The ship lurched again. More cups and plates slid off the table. Jack and Annie almost slid off their chairs. But without any sign of nervousness, the officers and scientists stood up and hurried out of the room, as if they knew just what to do in bad weather.



“I’ll take you down to the hold,” Henry said to Jack and Annie. “We’ll wait there until the waves calm down.”

The ship pitched violently as they stood up from the table. Holding on to the back of their life vests, Henry steered Jack and Annie out of the wardroom. Jack nearly slipped on the wet floor. His bare feet crushed some soggy biscuits and pickles. He tried not to think about it.

Out in the dark hall, the wind howled down the stairwell from the top deck, spraying them all with ocean foam.

“I must go secure my lab,” Henry shouted to Jack and Annie. He pointed to the stairs. “Go down one more flight! I’ll join you when I can!”

“We’ll come with you!” said Annie.

“’Tis better to be safe!” said Henry. “Follow the others quickly! I’ll come soon!” Henry unlocked the door to his lab and disappeared inside.

“Come on, let’s go down!” said Jack. He grabbed Annie’s hand and pulled her toward the stairwell. Officers and sailors were all heading down the steps ahead of them.

Just as Jack and Annie started down, the ship lurched again. Jack’s stomach lurched with it. He covered his mouth. I am definitely going to be sick! he thought. He really didn’t want to throw up on the stairs—or in front of the captain and the others!

“You go down! I’ll be right there!” Jack shouted to Annie.

“Why? Where are you going?” Annie yelled.

“Just go down!” said Jack. Then he whirled around and charged up two flights of steep steps to the top deck.

When Jack stepped onto the deck, the rain was pounding. The wind was howling. The waves looked like dark mountains. Sea foam was blowing everywhere.

Jack knew at once he’d made a mistake. Better to be embarrassed than drown! he thought. Just as he turned to go back down the steps, Annie burst onto the deck.

“Jack!” she cried. “What are you doing?”

Jack forgot all about throwing up. “I made a mistake!” he shouted. “We shouldn’t be up here! Go down! I’m coming with you! We have to go back down!” He pushed Annie toward the stairwell.

A giant wave crashed over the side of the ship. Jack fell and slid across the foam-covered deck. It was impossible to see anything. The wind was screaming. Jack tried to stand, but wearing his clumsy life vest, he couldn’t get back on his feet.

Jack finally hauled himself up. But just as he did, another giant wave broke over the side of the ship! The ship rolled again, and Jack fell to his knees. Another wave crashed over the deck. Jack was swept up by the foamy water—and tossed overboard into the churning sea!


7. Help!


Jack plunged down into the sea. The water was freezing cold. He bobbed back up to the surface, choking and coughing. The life vest kept Jack afloat, but the waves kept hammering him.

“Help!” Jack shouted. Thoughts of the twenty-foot tiger shark and the mysterious monster shot through his mind. “Help! Help!” he screamed.

Jack heard someone else screaming, “Help!” It was Annie! She’d been washed off the ship, too!

Jack flailed his arms and kicked his legs, trying to get to Annie. A wave lifted her up and tossed her toward him. But just as Jack reached for her hand, another wave pushed her past him, out of reach.

“The wand, Jack!” Annie shouted. “Use the wand!”

The wand! Jack thought. The Wand of Dianthus! Where was it? In his backpack! He didn’t have his backpack! Where was his backpack?

“Jack! The wand!” Annie yelled.

“I don’t have it!” Jack shouted. His voice was lost in the roar of the storm. Jack kept flailing and kicking, trying to reach Annie again.

Jack felt his cork life vest coming loose. Another wave crashed over him, and one side of the vest slipped off his arm!

Jack clutched the vest, trying to keep it on. But the waters kept pulling and tugging. The sea itself now seemed like a monster!

As Jack desperately fought the water, he saw another life vest floating free on the waves. It was Annie’s!

Where was she?

“Annie!” Jack screamed. As he looked around, he lost his fight with the sea—a wave washed his vest right off him! Then another wave crashed down on his head and pushed him down into the deep.

Jack held his breath as he plunged through the black water. He thrashed his arms and kicked his legs, trying to get back to the surface. His head popped above the waves, and he took one deep gulp of air before another wave washed over him and he went under again.

Jack kept kicking and trying to swim, but the fight to get back to the surface was too great. Just when he was about to run out of air, he felt something curl around his waist. Then he felt himself being lifted toward the surface!

Jack’s head popped above the water again. He opened his mouth and gasped for air. The waves were swirling and foamy, but Jack kept his head above them. Something around his waist was holding him up.

Jack couldn’t think at first. He was trying too hard to breathe. But then he saw something spreading across the water near him. It looked like a giant gray umbrella with dark spots all over it.

Rising from the center of the umbrella was a huge, rounded head! It had yellow eyes with black pupils. Stretching out from the umbrella were tentacles—lots of tentacles, all connected by a thick web, with double rows of suckers on each one.

A giant octopus! Jack thought with horror. It was much bigger than the octopus they’d seen a long time ago. And this time, a tentacle of the huge creature was curling around his waist!

“Help!” Jack shrieked. He tried to pull himself free from the thick, rubbery arm.

The giant octopus held him tightly. Jack looked around wildly. Where was Annie?



“Jack!” Annie shouted.

Jack saw her. One of the octopus tentacles had lifted Annie above the surface of the water, too.

Jack’s relief at seeing Annie was matched by his terror. “We’re caught!” he cried. “Try to escape!”

Jack kept trying to break free from the huge tentacle. But the more he fought, the tighter the grip of the octopus became.

“Don’t fight him, Jack!” Annie yelled. “He’s rescuing us!”

Jack couldn’t think straight. Was she crazy? “He’ll strangle us and pull us back under!” he shouted. “We have to fight him!”

“No!” shouted Annie. “You’re wrong! Can’t you see? He’s saving us from drowning!”

He is? thought Jack.

Jack tried not to panic. The octopus arm around his middle felt firm, but he could tell that it wasn’t trying to strangle him. It actually felt like it was hugging him, circling him like an inner tube, holding him above the water.

Jack saw the creature’s huge yellow eyes fixed on him. As Jack stared back into his eyes, he knew what Annie was saying was true. The creature wasn’t trying to hurt him. Instead, the octopus looked concerned. He looked curious, too, and even a little shy.

Staring back into the eyes of the octopus, Jack found himself smiling. As he and Annie kept bobbing up and down in the arms of the octopus, all of Jack’s fear vanished. This was the weirdest rescue he’d ever experienced.

“Hi, you,” Annie said to the octopus. “We come in peace.”

Jack felt so dazed he started laughing. Annie laughed, too. Even the octopus looked amused.

Their laughter was interrupted by the blare of a horn. Jack heard men shrieking and shouting. He looked up and saw the HMS Challenger heading toward them.



8. Monster of the Deep

Sailors were on the top deck. They were yelling and pointing.

The giant octopus loosened his hold on Jack and Annie.

“The ship!” Jack gurgled before slipping under the water. His head popped back up. “Swim to the ship!” he shouted to Annie.

Jack and Annie started swimming. The sky was still covered with clouds and the sea was still rough. But arm over arm, they swam until they got close to the ladder on the side of the ship.

“Ahoy!” someone shouted from above. Jack looked up and saw Henry and the professor standing at the top of the ladder.

“Climb up!” yelled Henry.

“Hurry, children! Hurry!” cried the professor. “Before it comes back!”

Jack swam as fast as he could to the ladder. He and Annie got there at the same time. They pulled themselves onto the ladder and climbed. When they reached the top, Henry and the professor helped them onto the deck. Henry wrapped wool blankets around them.

“Thank goodness you are saved!” said the professor.

“I thought you were below in the hold!” said Henry. “How did you end up in the water?”

“The storm … the waves …,” gasped Jack, shivering.

“The waves threw us overboard,” said Annie.

“Why were you up on deck?” said Henry.

“I was—I was seasick!” said Jack.

“I followed Jack, and big waves came crashing down and washed us into the water!” said Annie.

“Our life vests saved us at first,” said Jack. “But then they came off!”

“Then the octopus saved us,” said Annie.

“That monster saved you?” asked the professor.

“No, no, not a monster,” said Jack, “a giant octopus!”

“Yes, the monster of the deep! I do not think it saved you, boy,” said the professor. “It is a miracle it did not eat you and your sister alive!”

“No, no, he’s—he’s not a monster. He didn’t try to do any of that—” said Jack.

“He did save us!” said Annie. “He held us up above the water.”

“Really!” said Jack. “He kept us from drowning. Then he got scared away by the ship.”

“We didn’t even thank him, Jack,” said Annie. “We didn’t say good-bye.”

Jack and Annie looked back at the water. “Hey, what’s going on over there?” said Annie. She pointed to the rear of the ship. Sailors were facing the sea, yelling and shouting.

“What are they yelling at?” Annie asked.

Jack and Annie threw off their blankets and took off across the deck. They saw Joe and Tommy standing at the edge of the crowd.

“What are they doing?” Annie yelled. “What’s going on?”

“They snared it in the net!” shouted Tommy.

“We’ve caught the beast at last!” shouted Joe.

“Caught it?” Annie looked at Jack.

“Come on!” Jack cried. He and Annie pushed their way through the crowd.

“Children, stop!” the professor shouted, hurrying after them. “Don’t get in the way!”

But Jack and Annie squeezed through the crowd of sailors and scientists until they got to the railing of the ship. They looked down.

The giant octopus was tangled in a net. His arms were churning the seawater into foam.



His body had turned bright red. A cloud of dark ink billowed around him.

“You’re hurting him!” yelled Annie. “Leave him alone!”

“Move away!” yelled a sailor.

Some of the sailors were yelling mean things at the octopus. Others seemed terrified. Even the captain was caught up in the panic. “Stand back!” he shouted. “It could be powerful enough to sink the ship!”

“That’s crazy!” yelled Jack. “Leave him alone!”

“Its tentacles are as hard as steel!” shouted one of the sailors.

“No, they’re not!” cried Annie. “They’re soft! They saved us from drowning!”

But everyone kept shouting:

“Hungry for human flesh!”

“Devour a man in one bite!”

“Thirsty for blood!”

“He’s not any of those things!” yelled Annie.

“Throw the harpoons!” yelled a sailor.

“Get your axes, swords, and knives!” yelled another.

“Ready the guns!” said the captain.

“No!” screamed Annie.

“No!” roared Jack.

“The children are right!” shouted the professor. He and Henry had squeezed through the crowd, too. They were standing behind Jack and Annie.

Jack felt a rush of relief. “The professor says we’re right!” yelled Annie.

“Do not destroy it, Captain!” roared the professor. “Haul it on board!”

“On board?” said Jack.

“Capture it alive and whole!” said the professor. His eyes gleamed. “So we can study it!”

“No, no, let him go,” said Jack. “Just let him swim away and be free!”

“Please!” screamed Annie. “Let him go!”

But neither the professor nor the captain seemed to hear Jack and Annie. They were too busy arguing over what to do with the giant octopus.

“We must kill it, Professor!” said the captain. “It could grab the hull and drag the ship down to the bottom!”

“But science needs it alive!” said the professor. “At least till we have examined it!”

By now the octopus had gathered his long arms around himself, as if for protection.

Annie burst into tears. “Henry, help him!” she sobbed. “Don’t let them kill him! Or capture him!”

Henry looked upset, too. “Excuse me, sirs!” he shouted. “Excuse me! The girl is right! We should let him go!”

But no one listened to Henry, either.

“Jack!” cried Annie. She grabbed Jack. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. “Save him! We have to save him!”

“What can we do? We’ve tried everything!” said Jack.

Then he remembered. His own words helped him remember. And Jack knew exactly what to do.



9. Think! Think!

“Where’s my backpack?” Jack yelled to Annie.

“What?” Annie said.

“My backpack!” said Jack.

“Don’t worry about that now,” said Annie. “We have to—”

“The wand! The wand!” Jack interrupted her.

“Oh!” said Annie. “The wand!”

“We have to find my pack! Fast!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie pushed past the sailors crowding the railing. They ran across the deck.

“Did you bring it in the rowboat?” yelled Annie.

“Yes! No! I don’t know!” said Jack. “I can’t remember!”

“Think! Think!” said Annie.

Jack tried to think as they ran around the upper deck of the ship. Did I have it in the row-boat? What happened in the rowboat? I felt sick in the rowboat! I hugged my backpack in the row-boat!

“I remember!” Jack shouted. “I was holding on to it when we first came aboard!”

“Then it’s here somewhere!” said Annie.

“The wardroom!” said Jack.

“Hurry!” cried Annie.

Jack and Annie raced down two flights of steps. They looked in the wardroom. Jack’s pack wasn’t there!

“Henry’s lab!” said Annie.

“Yes! Yes! It’s in there!” Jack cried. “I remember now! I left it on the table. I put it down when I looked through the microscope!”

Jack and Annie ran up one flight of steps to Henry’s lab. They tried to open the door, but it was locked!

“We need Henry!” said Jack.

“We don’t have time!” said Annie.

“We don’t have a choice!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie charged back up the stairs to the upper deck.

The crew was still gathered at the end of the deck, yelling and shrieking about the octopus.

Henry was coming toward them!

“Henry, help us!” said Annie. She raced to Henry and grabbed him by the arm. She pulled him toward the stairs. “You have to unlock your lab! We have to get Jack’s pack! It’s life or death! Hurry, hurry!”

“Why? What?” sputtered Henry.

“We’ll explain later!” said Jack.

“Just hurry!” said Annie.

Henry looked baffled, but he walked quickly and led Jack and Annie down the stairs. They nearly pushed him across the hall toward his lab. The scientist pulled out his key and unlocked the door.

Jack and Annie burst into the lab. “Yay!” said Annie. Jack’s pack was on the table!

Jack grabbed it and tore it open. He pulled out the Wand of Dianthus. The silver spiraled wand gleamed in the dim light of the room.

“What is that?” asked Henry.

“We’ll explain later!” said Annie.

“Come on, let’s go back up!” said Jack.

“No, we don’t have time!” cried Annie. “Use it now, Jack! Say something now! Before they hurt him!”

Jack held up the wand.

“Five words!” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. But what five words? This was their only chance!

“Hurry!” said Annie.

“I am!” said Jack. “But we can’t just save him this one time. We have to make sure the ship never, ever tries to hurt him or others like him again.”

Jack closed his eyes. He pictured the giant octopus … his umbrella-like body and long tentacles, the gaze of his yellow eyes—a gaze that had curiosity and shyness.



Jack thought of the sheer wonder of the octopus’s existence. The giant sea animal was incredibly amazing. He was like a miracle.

Jack wished he and Annie could explain the miracle of the octopus to everyone. But no one would listen to them. Unless— “Hurry, Jack! Say the words!” said Annie.

“Make them hear the truth!” The words had burst out of Jack.

“What?” said Annie.

“Make—them—hear—the—truth!” said Jack, his eyes still shut tight. “That’s my wish. Make all the guys upstairs hear the truth about the octopus.”

“What are you talking about?” said Henry. “What is that stick you’re waving?”

Jack opened his eyes. He shook his head at Annie. But she didn’t see him.

“It’s a magic wand!” Annie said to Henry.

“Actually—” said Jack, trying to think of something else to say.

“Oh, oh, yes, I see,” said Henry. He smiled sadly. “You’re pretending, like children.”

“We are children!” said Annie. “Come on, Jack. Let’s go tell them the truth!”


10. The Heart of the Ocean


Jack put the wand back in his pack. Then he and Annie charged out of the lab, with Henry behind them.

The three of them climbed back up the stairs. When they stepped onto the top deck, they heard the sailors still shouting and yelling. Jack and Annie raced across the deck. They pushed through the crowd until they got to the railing.

The octopus was still in the net, bright red and hiding his head in fear. The sailors had gathered weapons. Some were aiming harpoons. Others stood by with knives. Some pointed pistols.

“Stop!” cried Annie.

“Stand back!” the captain yelled at her.

“You must bring it up alive!” begged the professor. “I beg you to let me examine it before you slay it, Captain!”

But before the captain could answer, someone hurled a harpoon at the creature. It missed and landed in the water with a splash.

“No!” yelled Annie.

“Listen to us!” Jack yelled in his loudest voice. “You have to hear the truth!” He stood up on the bottom rung of the ship’s railing so everyone could hear him. “Don’t touch him!” he shouted. “He’s not going to hurt you! He deserves to live peacefully in the sea! He’s a miracle of nature!”

But no one was listening to Jack. No one even turned to look at him.

“Stop! Hear us!” said Annie. “We speak the truth! Leave him alone!”

“Remove the children!” the captain roared again. “Now!”

Tommy and Joe grabbed Jack and Annie.

“Let us go! We have to talk to them!” yelled Annie, kicking and flailing. She and Jack broke loose from the sailors.

“She’s right! They have to hear the truth!” yelled Jack, running toward the railing. “He’s okay where he is! He’s different from people, but he’s a miracle!”

Again, no one seemed to hear him.

“The magic’s not working!” Annie cried to Jack.

“I know!” said Jack. He was desperate. No one was hearing the truth! What was wrong? He and Annie had followed the rules: They were trying to help others, not themselves. They had tried their hardest first. And Jack had used only five words.

“Look!” a sailor shrieked. “Look at the monster!”

Jack and Annie looked back at the water.

The giant octopus had uncovered his head and raised it out of the water. “LEHHHHHHHH!” The sound was breathy and whispery, as if it came from the wind.

The members of the crew lowered their weapons and stepped back in awe. “It—it speaks!” shouted a sailor.

“MEEEEEEEEEEE!” The sound was wild and shrill, as if it came from a deep forest.

“GOOOOOOOOO!” The sound was hollow and haunted, as if it came from an ancient gong or bell or drum.

“HOOOOOOOOME!” The sound was unbearably sad, as if it came from the heart of the ocean.

“IMMMMMNOOOOOMONNNSTERRR!” The octopus fell back into the water. All the seamen and scientists stared in wonder and terror.

Then Annie’s voice rang through the silence. “Did you hear him? He said, ‘Let me go home. I’m no monster.’”

The crew looked at each other in shock.

“That’s what ’e said. I heard it,” one man said. “Heard it with my own ears.”

“I heard it, too!” said another.

“Me too!” said another.

“It’s a sign,” said a sailor. “We can’t hurt ’im—”

“Or any other like ’im!” said another.

All eyes turned to the captain. He stood still for a moment, staring down at the giant octopus in the net. The captain looked at the professor. The professor seemed stunned. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.

The captain looked at Jack and Annie. “Please hear him,” Annie said. “He told you the truth.”

The captain stared at the octopus for a long moment. Then he raised his hand. “Free him,” he said softly.

The sailors slowly put down their harpoons, axes, pistols, and ropes.

“Sir, I request permission to cut the creature from the net,” Henry said to the captain.

The captain nodded. “Permission granted, Mr. Moseley,” said the captain.

“Help me,” Henry said to Jack and Annie.

“Sure!” said Jack.

“We’ll come, too, mate,” said Joe.

Joe and Tommy hurried after Henry, Jack, and Annie to a row of small boats on the deck. The sailors lowered one of the boats down to the surface of the water. Then Jack, Annie, Joe, Tommy, and Henry all climbed down the ladder and stepped inside.

Everyone else watched from the deck. Joe and Tommy rowed along the side of the ship until they came to the spot where the giant octopus was trapped. The two sailors held the boat steady with their oars. “Grab the net,” Henry said to Jack and Annie.

Jack reached out and grabbed a corner of the net. Annie helped him pull it out of the water. Henry used a big knife to slice through the thick rope strands.



Even though the rowboat rocked violently, Jack didn’t feel sick at all.

Jack, Annie, and Henry pulled the torn net into the small boat. Jack kept staring at the octopus. He looked back at all of them with his great eyes, his tentacles spread about him like a giant flower. His fierce red color had changed back to gray.

“Good-bye, you,” Annie said softly. “Go home now.”

The octopus lifted two of his tentacles as if to wave good-bye. Then he slipped under the surface of the water and vanished.



11. Good-bye, Mates

Jack looked up. The captain, the professor, and the crew members were all gazing silently down at the water.

Henry gave the captain a salute. The captain saluted back. Then everyone on board clapped and shouted.

Overhead the clouds had disappeared, as if a curtain had been pulled away from the sky. Pink and red swirls of light streaked the blue.

The cheering died down. “Let us disturb these waters no more!” commanded the captain. “Unfurl the sails! Get the steam up in the boilers!”

Henry turned to Jack and Annie. “While they prepare the ship, shall we return you to shore?” he asked.

“Yes, please,” said Annie.

Jack just nodded. He was totally exhausted.

As Joe and Tommy started rowing back toward land, the wind shifted and died down to a breeze.

“I predict a fine, clear night tonight,” said Tommy.

“And tomorrow, too,” said Joe. “The wind should be brisk.”

“A good time to sail,” said Tommy.

When they drew close to shore, Tommy and Joe both jumped out of the boat. Splashing through the shallows, they pulled the boat up onto the beach. Jack and Annie hopped out. Henry climbed out after them.

“Thanks!” Jack said to the sailors.

Henry walked with Annie and Jack up to the dunes. “Are you sure you’ll be all right?” he asked. “What will you do when night comes on?”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “We’ll get back to our parents before dark.”

“Lucky you,” Henry said wistfully. “I wish I could be back to my own family before dark.”

“I hope you keep having a good voyage,” said Annie.

“And I hope you learn a lot,” said Jack. “Bye.”

“Wait, before you go—” said Henry. “I want to give you something.” Henry reached into the pocket of his vest and took out the beautiful nautilus shell. “The real reason I ran into my lab when the storm came was to get this,” he said. “I didn’t want to risk losing it. But now I would like to give it to you.”

“Oh, no, Henry. You love it. You keep it,” said Annie.

“I do love it,” said Henry. “But I want you two to have it. Today you taught me—no, you taught all of us—an important lesson. It is a dark day in the deep sea when we cause innocent creatures to suffer. The professor said we can conquer our fears through knowledge. But you taught us that our fears can best be conquered through compassion. Even we scientists must never forget to have compassion for all living creatures. My compassion for the little creature that once lived in this shell made me very happy.”



Oh, man! thought Jack. That’s the secret!

Henry held out the gleaming nautilus shell, and Annie took it from him. “Thanks, Henry,” said Annie. “We promise to take very good care of it.”

“Thank you,” said Henry. He brushed his hand across his eyes. “Well, I must say good-bye now. Enjoy the rest of your vacation.”

Henry saluted them. Before Jack and Annie could say anything, the scientist turned and walked briskly back to the rowboat.

“Let’s go,” Annie said to Jack.

Jack and Annie walked around the dunes and headed through the sea grass to the rope ladder. Then they climbed back into the tree house and looked out the window. The rowboat was gliding over the shimmering water of the sunlit sea, heading back to the HMS Challenger.

“Good-bye, mates,” said Jack.

“Our mission!” said Annie, as if she’d just remembered. She looked at Jack. “We didn’t discover a secret of happiness!”

“Yes, we did,” said Jack with a smile. “Henry said it, actually. A secret of happiness is having compassion for all living creatures.”

“Compassion?” said Annie.

“Yeah, that means feeling sympathy and love for them,” said Jack.

“Oh, sure,” Annie said matter-of-factly. “Loving other creatures makes me really happy. I wonder why some people don’t get that.”

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Too bad they have to see a miracle first, like an octopus talking,” said Annie.

“I know what you mean,” said Jack. “The octopus just being an octopus is the real miracle.”

Annie smiled. “And Henry’s seashell—the little creature inside—him too,” she said. “He was a miracle, too.” She held out the shining shell.

Jack took the shell from her and carefully put it in his backpack. “The shell will help us remember the secret,” he said.

“I think we always knew it,” said Annie. “Henry just put it into words for us. Come on, let’s go.”

Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book and turned to the picture of the Frog Creek woods. “Lehhh meee gooo hooome,” she said, repeating the strange sounds from the octopus.

Jack smiled. He started to tell her to say it right. But before he could, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Soft raindrops pattered against the roof of the tree house.

“I love being home,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack with a sigh.

Jack and Annie strapped on their bike helmets and pulled on their sneakers. Then Jack took their research book out of his pack and put in their library books.

“All I want to do now is go into our warm, dry house and see Mom and Dad,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “And read one of my new library books.”

“And eat dinner,” said Annie.

“A good dinner,” said Jack. “No stale biscuits or lime juice.” He slipped on his backpack. “And no pea soup.”

“Pea soup?” asked Annie.

But Jack had already started down the ladder. “And then read a little more and climb into bed,” he continued.

“A warm, dry bed in a warm, dry house,” said Annie, following him.

“Yep,” said Jack, stepping onto the wet ground. “I guess the octopus just wanted to go home, too. Hey, I wonder if he has a name.”

“Hmm …,” said Annie. She and Jack climbed on their bikes. “I think his name might be … Charles!”

“That sounds right,” said Jack, laughing. “I wonder if Charles has an octopus wife—and octopus kids.”

“I bet he does,” said Annie. “And I bet he couldn’t wait to get home and hold them in all eight of his arms.”

Jack laughed again. “Yeah, I bet you’re right,” he said. Then he and Annie took off riding through the Frog Creek woods.

The rain fell harder. But it didn’t matter. They were heading home.



Author’s Notes

When I first decided to write about the deep sea, I had no idea where the story should take place or what sort of adventure should happen. Once I started my research, though, I discovered some exciting facts about ocean exploration in the 1800s. The ships that set sail were not seeking to discover new lands but rather to discover the depth, the life, and the structure of the world beneath the ocean. Many writers caught the romantic fever of writing about such voyages. The most famous of these stories was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne.

The ship I decided to base my fictional story on was HMS Challenger, an English vessel that sailed nearly 70,000 miles between 1872 and 1876. During that time, the British scientists aboard the ship found more than 4,000 new living species of sea life! As well as gathering a huge number of plants and animals, their explorations gave the world a new understanding of the landscape of the deep sea, including how deep it is and that it has mountains and ridges just like the land above water.

When shell collecting was very popular in the 1800s, the most sought-after shell was the chambered nautilus. I learned in my research that during the actual voyage of HMS Challenger, a living chambered nautilus was captured in the South Pacific. When it was placed in a tub, the creature inside the shell swam around, ejecting water out of its funnel. I imagined this was the creature that Henry had so loved.

The character of Henry was inspired by a real scientist who sailed aboard the Challenger named Henry Moseley. He was a young man in his twenties when the voyage began. He loved natural history and became one of the greatest natural scientists of his time. The chief scientist on the Challenger was Charles Wyville Thomson, a brilliant Scottish professor.

All the scientists aboard the ship were courageous explorers who gave birth to a new area of study called oceanography, which is a branch of knowledge concerning the earth’s oceans and seas. Today oceanographers all over the world study climate change, global warming, water pollution, and related concerns. They are working hard to protect the precious life under the sea.

Jack was raking leaves on a chilly November afternoon. Geese honked overhead.

“Smile,” said Annie.

Annie was pointing her camera at him. “No pictures now,” he said.

“Come on,” said Annie. “Smile!”

Jack gave her a goofy smile.

“A real one,” said Annie. “I’m taking pictures for our family project at school.”

Jack crossed his eyes and made his smile even goofier.

“Okay. Be that way,” said Annie. “I’m going into the woods.”

“Good,” said Jack. “Go.”

“Maybe the tree house is back,” said Annie.

“You always say that when you want me to stop what I’m doing and do something with you,” said Jack.

“Maybe Teddy and Kathleen are waiting for us,” said Annie.

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” said Jack.

“Maybe today’s the day they want us to look for a fourth secret of happiness for Merlin,” said Annie. “Maybe they’re going to send us to a super-cool place.”

“Good. Hope they do. Have fun,” said Jack. “I want to finish raking these leaves before dark.” He glanced up at the late-afternoon sky—just in time to see a bright streak of light pass over the Frog Creek woods. “Whoa!” Jack turned to Annie with a smile. “Did you see that?”

“Hold that smile!” said Annie as she took Jack’s picture. “Thanks! Perfect.”

“But did you see that?” Jack asked. “The light going over the woods?”

“Ha-ha,” said Annie.

“No, I’m serious! It was a bright light! Wait a second!” Jack put down his rake and dashed into the house. “Mom! Dad!” he shouted. “Annie and I are going for a walk, okay?”

“Okay,” called their dad, “but be home before dark!”

“And wear your scarves and hats!” called their mom.

“We will!” Jack grabbed their scarves, their hats, and his backpack from the hall closet and ran back outside. “Let’s go!” he said to Annie.

Annie put her camera in her jacket pocket and took off running with Jack. They ran up the sidewalk, crossed the street, and headed into the shadowy Frog Creek woods. They crunched over a carpet of fallen leaves until they came to the tallest tree.

The magic tree house was there! Kathleen and Teddy were looking out the window. The two young enchanters were both wearing dark cloaks.

“Hi! Hi!” Annie shouted.

“We were about to come looking for you!” said Kathleen. “How did you know we were here?”

“I saw the light!” said Jack.

“Climb up!” said Teddy.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, they hugged Teddy and Kathleen.

“Is it time to go on another mission?” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Kathleen.

“And it is quite urgent now,” said Teddy.

“Merlin is failing quickly,” said Kathleen. She blinked back tears.

“Oh, no!” said Annie.

“Morgan wants you to find the final secret of happiness today,” said Teddy. “And then you must return to Camelot to present all four secrets to Merlin. You remember the first three, do you not?”

“Sure!” said Jack. “We have three gifts to help us remember. I kept them in my backpack.”

“A poem, a drawing, and a seashell,” said Annie.

“Good,” said Teddy. “Here is where you will look for the final secret.” He took a book from his cloak and handed it to Jack.

On the cover was a picture of a volcano surrounded by snow and ice. The title said:

“Antarctica?” said Jack. “We studied Antarctica in school. There’s hardly anything there. Where would we find a secret of happiness in Antarctica?”

“I do not know,” said Kathleen. “But Morgan has sent a rhyme to help your search.” She handed Annie a slip of parchment.

Annie read Morgan’s rhyme aloud:

For the final secret, you must go

To a burning mountain of ice and snow

On wheels, by air, then all fall down,

Till you come to the Cave of the Ancient Crown.

Then speed to Camelot by close of day,

Lest grief take Merlin forever away.



“Forever away?” said Annie.

“I fear so,” said Teddy.

“I don’t understand,” said Jack. “This rhyme sounds like we’re going to a fantasy world, a place with ‘a burning mountain’ and a ‘Cave of the Ancient Crown.’ But Antarctica’s a real place, totally real.”

“Aye, Morgan’s rhyme is a mystery to me, too,” said Teddy.

“But you still have the Wand of Dianthus to help you, do you not?” asked Kathleen.

“Yes,” said Jack. But he looked inside his backpack just to make sure. There it was: the gleaming spiraled wand of the unicorn.

“Good,” said Kathleen. “And you remember the three rules of the wand?”

“Sure,” said Annie. “The wand’s magic only works if our wish is for the good of others. It only works after we’ve tried our hardest. And it only works if our wish is five words.”

“Excellent,” said Teddy.

“I wish you guys could come with us,” said Jack.

“We must return to Morgan and try to help Merlin,” said Kathleen. “But with your courage and intelligence, I know you will be able to find the secret by yourselves.”

Jack nodded, embarrassed. But Kathleen’s words did make him feel more confident.

“And after you have found it, you must hurry to meet us in Camelot,” said Teddy. “Just point to the word ‘Camelot’ on the rhyme from Morgan and make a wish to go there.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

“Go now. Quickly,” said Kathleen. “And good luck.”

“See you soon,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath, then pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Here’s what kids have to say to

Mary Pope Osborne, author of

the Magic Tree House series:

WOW! You have an imagination like no other.—Adam W.



I love your books. If you stop writing books, it will be like losing a best friend.—Ben M.



I think you are the real Morgan le Fay. There is always magic in your books.—Erica Y.



One day I was really bored and I didn’t want to read. . . . I looked in your book. I read a sentence, and it was interesting. So I read some more, until the book was done. It was so good I read more and more. Then I had read all of your books, and now I hope you write lots more.—Danai K.



I always read [your books] over and over . . .  1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times. . . . —Yuan C.



You are my best author in the world. I love your books. I read all the time. I read everywhere. My mom is like freaking out.—Ellen C.



I hope you make these books for all yours and mine’s life.—Riki H.





Teachers and librarians love

Magic Tree House® books, too!

Thank you for opening faraway places and times to my class through your books. They have given me the chance to bring in additional books, materials, and videos to share with the class.—J. Cameron



It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books. . . . I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year. . . . WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! . . . Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home. . . . I have since introduced this great series to my class. They have absolutely fallen in love with these books! . . . My students are now asking me for more independent reading time to read them. Your stories have inspired even my most struggling readers.—M. Payne



I love how I can go beyond the [Magic Tree House] books and use them as springboards for other learning.—R. Gale



We have enjoyed your books all year long. We check your Web site to find new information. We pull our map down to find the areas where the adventures take place. My class always chimes in at key parts of the story. It feels good to hear my students ask for a book and cheer when a new book comes out.—J. Korinek



Our students have “Magic Tree House fever.” I can’t keep your books on the library shelf.—J. Rafferty



Your books truly invite children into the pleasure of reading. Thanks for such terrific work.—S. Smith



The children in the fourth grade even hide the [Magic Tree House] books in the library so that they will be able to find them when they are ready to check them out.—K. Mortensen



My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





For many years, one of my favorite places to visit has been the Central Park Zoo in New York City. My husband, Will, and I love going there for one main reason: to visit the building where about sixty gentoo and chinstrap penguins live. The penguins always make us laugh—especially when they jump out of the water onto the edge of their pool. We also love watching their keepers call each penguin by name and hand-feed fish to them.

While I was writing this book, I combined my memories of watching the penguins at the zoo with my research on Antarctica. And I used my imagination to think about Jack and Annie searching for a secret of happiness to share with Merlin. I always mix these three things together to create a Magic Tree House book: memory, research, and imagination. But there’s one other ingredient that goes into my work on this series: joy. I love to write—and I love sharing Jack and Annie’s adventures with you. That’s one of my own personal secrets of happiness.

For Nory van Rhyn,

who reminds me of Penny



“Glittering white, shining blue, raven black;

in the light of the sun the land looks like a fairy tale.”

—Roald Amundsen,

the first explorer to reach

the South Pole, 1911





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

For their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie were told they must travel to real times and real places in history and prove to Merlin that they could use magic wisely.

Now Jack and Annie must save Merlin himself. Morgan le Fay has asked them to find four secrets of happiness to help Merlin out of a deep sadness. Having found the first three secrets, they are waiting to find out where they are going to search for the fourth…


1. Smile

Jack was raking leaves on a chilly November afternoon. Geese honked overhead.

“Smile,” said Annie.

Annie was pointing her camera at him. “No pictures now,” he said.

“Come on,” said Annie. “Smile!”

Jack gave her a goofy smile.

“A real one,” said Annie. “I’m taking pictures for our family project at school.”

Jack crossed his eyes and made his smile even goofier.

“Okay. Be that way,” said Annie. “I’m going into the woods.”

“Good,” said Jack. “Go.”

“Maybe the tree house is back,” said Annie.

“You always say that when you want me to stop what I’m doing and do something with you,” said Jack.

“Maybe Teddy and Kathleen are waiting for us,” said Annie.

“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” said Jack.

“Maybe today’s the day they want us to look for a fourth secret of happiness for Merlin,” said Annie. “Maybe they’re going to send us to a super-cool place.”

“Good. Hope they do. Have fun,” said Jack. “I want to finish raking these leaves before dark.” He glanced up at the late-afternoon sky—just in time to see a bright streak of light pass over the Frog Creek woods. “Whoa!” Jack turned to Annie with a smile. “Did you see that?”

“Hold that smile!” said Annie as she took Jack’s picture. “Thanks! Perfect.”

“But did you see that?” Jack asked. “The light going over the woods?”

“Ha-ha,” said Annie.

“No, I’m serious! It was a bright light! Wait a second!” Jack put down his rake and dashed into the house. “Mom! Dad!” he shouted. “Annie and I are going for a walk, okay?”

“Okay,” called their dad, “but be home before dark!”

“And wear your scarves and hats!” called their mom.

“We will!” Jack grabbed their scarves, their hats, and his backpack from the hall closet and ran back outside. “Let’s go!” he said to Annie.

“Got it,” said Annie.

“Go now. Quickly,” said Kathleen. “And good luck.”

“See you soon,” said Annie.

Jack took a deep breath, then pointed to the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. Lots of Ice


“Welcome to Antarctica,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie were bundled in cold-weather gear. They both wore snow pants, gloves, boots with spikes, and thick red parkas with hoods. Goggles covered their eyes, and wool masks covered their mouths and noses. A hiker’s backpack had replaced Jack’s own pack.

Jack felt trapped by all the gear. He pulled his mask down under his chin and pushed his goggles onto his forehead. Annie did the same. Their breath made clouds of mist in the freezing air.



“It’s really cold here!” said Jack. The wind stung his bare face and made his eyes water. But he kept his mask and goggles off as he looked out the window with Annie.

The tree house was on the ground. It was tucked under the overhang of an ice cliff near the ocean. Icy seawater sparkled in the sunlight. The shore was silent and deserted.

“It looks totally empty out there,” said Jack. “I still don’t get it—how do we find the Cave of the Ancient Crown here? No king or queen ever ruled Antarctica. In fact, no people ever lived here at all until explorers came in recent times.”

“Let’s get started and try to figure it all out,” said Annie.

“Not so fast,” said Jack. He pulled off his glove and opened their research book to the first chapter. He read aloud:

The continent of Antarctica is the coldest, driest, and windiest place on earth. Larger in area than the United States, it is a land filled with ice—ice cliffs, icebergs, ice sheets, ice shelves—



“Okay, lots of ice,” said Annie. “Got it. Let’s go.”

“In a minute.” Jack kept reading:

But Antarctica was not always a land of ice. Eons ago, it was part of a supercontinent scientists have named Gondwana. It had forests, flowers, and many animals, including dinosaurs. But no people ever lived there.



“See?” said Jack. “No kings, no queens, no crowns.”

“Yep, let’s go,” said Annie.

But Jack kept reading:

Over millions of years, Antarctica broke off from Gondwana and drifted south.



“Okay, I’m drifting now myself, Jack,” said Annie. “Byeee—” She climbed out the window and disappeared from the tree house.

Jack looked back at the book, but before he could read further, he heard Annie whoop with laughter. “Oh, wow! Jack, come look!” she yelled.

“What is it?” said Jack, closing the book.

“You won’t believe this!” said Annie. “You have to come see!”

Jack put his glove back on and pulled on his backpack. He folded the paper with Morgan’s rhyme and put it in his pocket. Then, clutching the research book to his chest, he climbed out of the window.

Jack followed the sound of Annie’s laughter beyond the tree house. On the frozen seashore was a group of penguins, grown-ups and babies. The grown-ups had orange streaks on their cheeks, puffy white chests, and black wings they held straight by their sides. The babies were fluffy balls of gray fuzz. All the penguins were waddling toward Annie. They rocked from side to side, taking funny little steps.

Jack burst out laughing. The big penguins looked like a committee of little men in black suits.

The group stopped in front of Annie and squawked at her.

“Hi, guys,” said Annie. “Glad to meet you!”

The penguins stared back at her with friendly curiosity.

“They’re so cool,” said Jack. He opened the book and found a picture that looked like the group of penguins around Annie. He read:

Emperor penguins are the tallest and heaviest of the penguin species and are also the most ancient. Over three feet tall, grown penguins can weigh up to ninety pounds. Researchers say the penguin’s closest ancestors lived 40 million years ago.



“Forty million years!” said Jack. “So what time have we gone back to? A million years ago? A thousand years ago?”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But I’ll take a picture of them for my family project. They look like a little family, don’t they?” She pulled her camera out of her pocket and aimed it at the penguins. “Smile, everyone.”

As Annie took a picture, a shadow moved over the ice. The penguins squawked loudly and clustered together.

Jack and Annie looked up. The shadow belonged to a giant bird circling above them. The bird was brownish gray with a long beak. It let out an eerie cry.

“What is that?” Annie asked with alarm.

“I’ll look it up,” said Jack. He flipped through the pages of their book to find a photo. “Here!” He read quickly:

Giant petrels are the vultures of Antarctica. They eat dead birds and animals. Sometimes they even attack young seals and pen—



“Oh, no!” cried Annie.

Jack looked up. The petrel was diving toward the penguins. It hit the smallest one with its wing and swooped back into the air.

The penguin squawked and waddled away from the group. The petrel spread its wide wings and dove again.

“NO!” Annie cried.

The petrel swooped away but circled back toward them.

Jack dropped the book and scooped up a handful of snow to make a snowball. Before he could throw it, the petrel attacked again. Jack leapt toward the small penguin. He fell on his knees and threw his arms around the fluffy little body.



Annie charged at the petrel. “Go! Get out of here!” she yelled, waving her arms.

The petrel cawed, then rose high into the sky and disappeared over the ice cliff.

Jack let go of the small penguin and stood up. The penguin peeped and waggled its head at Jack.

Jack laughed. “You’re welcome,” he said. “Now go back to your family. Go—”

He shooed the penguin back to the group. “All of you guys, back in the water now. You’ll be safer there. Go, go.”

The penguins squawked and flapped their wings as if saying good-bye. Then they waddled across the icy shore, taking quick, tiny steps toward the sea. One after another, they dove between cracks in the ice until they all disappeared.

“Bye, guys,” said Annie.

HONK!

“What’s that?” said Jack.

HONK!

“It sounds like some kind of horn,” said Annie.

“That’s weird,” said Jack.

“It’s coming from over there,” said Annie.

Jack picked up their book and followed Annie up the side of an icy slope. The metal spikes on his boots dug into the ice and kept him from slipping. When he and Annie reached the top, they looked down.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “We haven’t gone back in time at all!”


3. Short Grown-ups


In the icy field below the slope were yellow, brown, and green buildings; telephone poles; metal pipes; and storage tanks. Tractors and bulldozers moved along gravel roads. It looked like a small town.

HONK! The sound came from a red bus with gigantic wheels that was parked nearby.

“What is this place?” asked Annie.

Jack looked in their book and found a photo that looked like the scene below. The caption read: McMurdo Station. Jack read the paragraph under the photo:

Antarctica has many scientific research stations, representing countries from all over the world. The largest is named McMurdo Station. Researchers live there for weeks or even months at a time.

HONK!

Jack looked up. He saw four people come out of a yellow building and start toward the bus. They were all bundled in red parkas with hoods, goggles, and masks. They carried backpacks and camera bags.

“They must be researchers,” said Jack.

“Let’s go talk to them,” said Annie.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “They’ll ask why two kids are traveling alone in Antarctica.”

“Maybe they won’t know we’re kids,” said Annie. “If we put our goggles and masks back on, we’ll look just like them, only shorter. They’ll think we’re short grown-ups.”

“Uh … I don’t think so,” said Jack.

Just then someone jumped off the bus. “Hi, folks!” a woman shouted to the four researchers. “I’m Nancy—your bus driver and guide today!”

Nancy caught sight of Jack and Annie. She waved her arms at them. “Hello!” she called. “Are you two part of the group going up to the volcano?” She pointed toward a mountain looming in the distance.

“Did you hear that?” Jack said to Annie. “A volcano!” He cupped his gloved hands around his mouth. “Yes!” he shouted back in his deepest voice. “We’re coming!”

“We are?” Annie asked with surprise.

“A volcano—get it?” said Jack. “A volcano is ‘a burning mountain’!”

“Oh, right!” said Annie. “Like in the rhyme—the burning mountain! Got it!”

“Quick, cover up your face!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie covered their eyes with their goggles and pulled up their face masks. Then they started walking toward the bus.

“Try not to talk to anyone unless we have to,” Jack said quickly. “And if we do, talk in a really deep voice.”

“No problem,” Annie croaked in a really deep voice.

“Um … maybe you shouldn’t talk at all,” said Jack.

“Hurry!” Nancy called to them.

“Coming!” Jack shouted in his deepest voice, and they started running across the snow.

By the time Jack and Annie arrived at the bus, everyone but Nancy had climbed aboard. “Good. You made it just in time!” Nancy said. “Follow me!” She bounded up the steep steps of the red bus and sat in the driver’s seat.

Without a word, Jack and Annie climbed on after Nancy. Walking down the aisle, Jack glanced at the others in the group. A couple of them nodded and he nodded back. Everyone was hidden behind goggles, ski masks, and bulky parkas. Jack couldn’t tell anyone’s age, or even whether they were male or female.

Jack and Annie sat a few rows behind the others. Jack took off his backpack and put it at his feet.

“All set?” Nancy asked, looking in the bus mirror.

Jack and Annie nodded.

Nancy closed the door and started the engine. As the bus’s giant wheels moved slowly over the gravel road, Jack looked out the window.

The sun shone brightly on the wide, snowy fields. Glittering ice crystals blew in the wind. All the world around them seemed to be sparkling.

“How’s everyone doing?” Nancy called over her shoulder. “Are you all happy campers?”

Everyone, including Jack and Annie, nodded.

“Good. I like travelers who don’t complain!” Nancy joked.

So far, so good, Jack thought. No one seemed to suspect they were kids.

“We have a short ride,” said Nancy. “But enough time for you all to introduce yourselves to me. I’m Nancy Tyler, and I work here in Antarctica as a guide, a bus driver, and a flight mechanic.”

“Cool,” whispered Annie.

“I know you all come from different countries as researchers and journalists,” said Nancy. “Start from the front and tell me who you are.”

The woman in front pulled down her face mask. “I’m Lucy Banks,” she said. “I’m an American, and I’m a space scientist. I’m writing a paper on the use of robots on the crater of Mount Erebus. Hopefully this will help our work on Mars someday.”

Oh, brother, thought Jack. What can we say? That we’re Jack and Annie from Frog Creek and we’ve come to Antarctica to find the fourth secret of happiness to save Merlin the magician in Camelot?

“Wonderful, Lucy!” Nancy said. “Antarctica is as similar to Mars as any place you can find on earth. Next?”

“Ali Khan, biologist from Turkey,” said the man sitting behind Lucy Banks. “I’m researching heat-resistant bacteria in the crater of Mount Erebus.”

Quick, think! thought Jack.

“Very good!” said Nancy. “Next?”

“Tony Sars from Sydney, Australia,” another man said. “I’m a travel writer for the Sydney Morning Herald.” He held up a notebook.

“Good!” said Nancy.

Yes! thought Jack. He yanked off a glove and pulled his notebook and a pencil out of his backpack.

“Kim Lee,” said the woman sitting behind Tony. “I’m a photographer for a Korean magazine.”

“Great,” said Nancy. “And my friends in the back?”

Without taking off his mask, Jack shouted in a deep voice, “Frog Creek Times, USA!” He held up his notebook. “Story about Antarctica. She’s … uh …”



Annie held up her camera. “His photographer!” she called in a deep voice.

“Excellent!” said Nancy. “A great group! We’ll hear more introductions later. Now, I know you’ve all heard this before, but I have to tell you again. It is very important to remember the rules here in Antarctica.”

Jack opened his notebook and got ready to write down the rules.

“Never rush,” said Nancy. “You should always think about where you’re going and what you’re doing.”

Jack scribbled:





“Never walk on snow and ice fields alone,” said Nancy. “In many places beneath the snow, there are deep, hidden cracks in the ice.”

Jack wrote:





“And remember, all of Antarctica is a nature preserve,” said Nancy. “Never, ever touch or disturb the wildlife.”

“Oops,” said Annie.

Jack frowned. “We really broke the rules with those penguins,” he whispered.

“I know, but we won’t do it again,” Annie whispered back.

“Right,” said Jack. He wrote down:





“Got all that?” Nancy asked the group.

Everyone nodded.

“Good,” said Nancy. “I look forward to sharing Antarctica with you today. I know you’ll all find some great information and stories!”

As the bus rolled along, no one gave Jack and Annie a second look. “Nancy called us ‘friends,’ ” Jack whispered to Annie. “The others must think she knows us.”

“Yeah, and she thinks we’re friends with them,” said Annie.

“We’re getting away with this,” said Jack. He could hardly believe it.

“It reminds me of our last mission,” Annie whispered, “on the ship with the ocean scientists.”

“This is better,” said Jack. “Here everyone’s treating us like grown-ups, and I don’t feel like throwing up.”

“And nowadays women get to do really cool stuff, too, like men do,” said Annie.

“Good point,” said Jack. “But there’s still stuff about our rhyme I don’t get.” He pulled the rhyme out of his pocket, and he and Annie read it silently:

For the final secret, you must go

To a burning mountain of ice and snow

On wheels, by air, then all fall down,

Till you come to the Cave of the Ancient Crown.

Then speed to Camelot by close of day,

Lest grief take Merlin forever away.

“See, it sounds like it’s talking about a magical world,” said Jack. “But Antarctica is a hundred percent real. It’s filled with scientists!”

“I know, but some of the rhyme fits,” said Annie. “Like you said, the ‘burning mountain of ice and snow’ is the volcano, Mount Erebus.” She pointed out the window of the bus. “And there it is.”

A white mountain loomed in the distance. Ice and snow covered its slopes, and puffs of smoke rose from its peak, drifting into the blue sky.

“It’s burning, all right,” said Jack.

“And we’re on wheels,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. He looked at the rhyme again. “Okay, ‘burning mountain of ice and snow,’ ‘on wheels’—but then what about ‘by air’? What’s—”

“Oh, my gosh!” said Annie, craning her neck.

“What?” said Jack.

“Look over there!” said Annie.


4. Happy Campers


Touching down onto a flat, snowy field was an orange and white helicopter. The helicopter had skis on the bottom so it could land on the ice and snow. The bus came to a stop at the edge of the field.

“We must be going to the volcano in a helicopter!” said Annie.

“By air! Just like the rhyme says!” said Jack. “Great!” Jack had always wanted to fly in a helicopter!

Nancy stood up. “For those of you getting off the bus now, please remember,” she said, “the helicopter blades are extremely dangerous. Always wait for a signal from the pilot before approaching the chopper.”



Everyone watched as the spinning blades slowly came to a stop. The pilot waved from the helicopter window.

“Okay, Pete says we can go!” said Nancy.

Jack put their rhyme back into his pocket. He pulled on his backpack. Then, carrying his notebook and pencil, he filed down the aisle after Annie and the others who would join them in the helicopter. They all scrambled off the bus into the dazzling sunlight.

“Jump aboard!” said Nancy.

Jack and Annie followed the four other adults up the steps of the helicopter and squeezed into a small cabin. Sitting in two rows of seats behind the pilot, everyone buckled their seat belts.

Nancy pulled the door shut and turned the latch. Then she sat next to Pete and put on a set of headphones. “Headphones on, everyone! They’re under your seats,” she said. “They’ll protect your ears from the chopper noise, and also serve as a radio so I can talk to you.”

Everyone reached under their seats and took out headphones. Jack and Annie pulled off their hoods. Without taking off their goggles or face masks, they placed the headphones over their ears. The thick pads muffled the sounds around them.

Jack heard Nancy’s voice over his headphones: “Testing, one, two, three. Can everyone hear me?”

Everyone nodded.

“Okay, Pete, take us to Mount Erebus!”

Pete the pilot started the helicopter. Even with his headphones on, Jack heard the roaring of the engine and the spinning of the blades. He held his breath as the chopper trembled and lifted off the ice and snow.

The helicopter shook and tilted. Then it buzzed forward through the blue sky.

Annie aimed her camera out the window and took pictures. The Korean photographer did the same, and the Australian journalist scribbled in his notebook.

Jack was too excited to take notes now. This is great, he thought. All the words in the rhyme are coming true. As they flew toward the burning mountain of ice and snow, he tried to remember what words came next. He slipped the rhyme out of his pocket and read:

… you must go

To a burning mountain of ice and snow

On wheels, by air, then all fall down …





“All fall down”? Wait a minute. What does that mean? thought Jack. Does that mean the chopper falls down? Do we fall out of the chopper?

As these thoughts swirled through Jack’s mind, Annie turned and gave him a thumbs-up.

Jack didn’t want to scare her, so he nodded and shoved the rhyme back in his pocket. He watched anxiously out the window as the chopper approached a bright orange-red circle on top of Mount Erebus.

“Below is one of the world’s most famous lava lakes,” said Nancy over the headphones.

The chopper hovered motionless above the crater of the volcano. The lava lake bubbled and boiled. “That burning lava is miles deep,” said Nancy. “Its temperature is over seventeen hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Can you guys on this side see okay? Pete?”

Pete tilted the helicopter to one side and then the other. Everyone but Jack oohed and aahed. Kim Lee and Annie took pictures.

Go! thought Jack. Before we all fall down!

“Okay, Pete, that’s great,” said Nancy. “Let’s land at the lower field camp now!”

The helicopter tilted upright and began moving down the side of the volcanic mountain. Jack saw a small orange building sticking up from the snow. Colorful snowmobiles were parked near it.

Moments later, the chopper touched down onto the slope. It rocked and shuddered, then came to a stop. Whew, thought Jack. They’d landed without falling from the sky into a burning lava lake. But then what could “all fall down” in the rhyme mean?

“Stay seated till the blades come to a complete stop!” said Nancy.

Everyone remained in their seats with their seat belts and headphones on.

“As you know, we’ll be driving our snowmobiles up to the summit,” said Nancy. “Driving a snowmobile can be very dangerous on these steep, icy slopes. Please remember everything you learned in your snowmobile training yesterday.”

As the others nodded, Annie nodded, too. Jack nudged her. They’d never had any training with snowmobiles!

“Another warning,” said Nancy. “I know you’ve also been training this week to prevent altitude sickness. But still—it can be very dangerous. So please let me know if you feel any symptoms.”

Altitude sickness? Jack wondered. He pulled off his glove again and opened up his backpack. He took out the research book and looked up altitude sickness in the index. He turned to the right page and read:

Altitude sickness, also known as mountain sickness, is caused by a lack of oxygen at great heights. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Climbers traveling up Mount Erebus train for days by climbing to gradually increasing heights.



Oh, no, thought Jack.

The spinning of the helicopter blades had come to a stop.

“Okay, happy campers,” said Nancy. “All clear! Before we drive up to the top, we’ll gather in the hut!”

Nancy opened the helicopter door. Everyone took off their headphones, undid their seat belts, and followed her down the steps of the chopper. Jack was last as he struggled with putting the research book away, getting his glove back on, and then pulling his pack onto his back.

“What took you so long?” Annie asked when he got out of the chopper.

Jack just shook his head.

“Have a safe trip back to the station, Pete!” called Nancy. “See you later!”

Pete waved from the window. Then the chopper blades started rotating again. The chopper lifted off the ground and thundered away.



5. Lava Bombs

Jack didn’t feel like a happy camper anymore. Walking through the cold, thin air, he looked at the snowmobiles parked near the hut.

“We don’t know how to drive snowmobiles!” Jack whispered to Annie. “We haven’t trained for anything, including altitude sickness!”

“That’s okay. If we get in trouble, we can use the wand,” said Annie.

“No, we can’t,” said Jack. “We can’t use the wand just for ourselves. Plus, we haven’t tried our hardest yet.”

“This way, gang,” called Nancy. She was ushering everyone into the small orange building.

Jack and Annie followed the group inside. The one-room hut had plastic chairs, a small heater, axes, jugs of water, and shelves with boxes of trail mix.

“Have a seat and help yourself to some of the best water in the world,” Nancy said. “It comes from melted glacier ice.”

Everyone sat on the plastic chairs. Lucy, Kim, Tony, and Ali poured water into tin cups and lowered their masks to drink. Jack was thirsty, but he shook his head no at Annie. He was afraid for them to show their faces.

“Before we take off, I want to warn you again about the snowmobiles,” said Nancy. “No matter how much training you’ve had, you must be very careful. On your ride up to the crater, remember to drive sideways so if the snowmobile slips and rolls over, your leg won’t get crushed.”

Everyone nodded.

How do you drive sideways? Jack wondered in a panic.

“Don’t be afraid to go fast, and don’t lock up the brakes,” said Nancy. “Locking your brakes can spell disaster.”

“And watch out for lava bombs,” said Ali, the biologist.

“Lava bombs?” Jack piped. He quickly cleared his throat and deepened his voice. “Excuse me. Lava bombs?”

“Lava that spits from the crater,” said Ali.

“Spits?” repeated Jack.

“Like oatmeal that bubbles and spatters out of the pot,” said Lucy, the space scientist.

“Except these bombs aren’t made of oatmeal,” said Ali. “They’re blobs of fiery hot liquid rock. Some of them can be as big as a car. They burn deep holes in the ice and snow.”

“If they hit you …,” said Tony, chuckling. “Well, just think about it.”

Jack didn’t want to think about it.

“Seriously, it’s pretty neat,” said Nancy. “For millions of years, hot gas and lava have carved deep, hidden places beneath the surface ice of these slopes—caverns and towers. No one knows all the secrets of Mount Erebus.”

Nancy took a last sip of water and put her cup down. “Okay, guys, you have a few hours to do your experiments and get your stories. Then Pete will come back for us. Let’s go!”

As Jack stood up to go, he almost fell over. The room was spinning. He closed his eyes, but that only made it worse. After the others had filed out the door, Jack sat back down on his chair. I’ll just stay here for a second, he thought, his heart pounding.

“You okay?” said Annie, coming back into the hut.

“I’m dizzy,” said Jack, trying to catch his breath. “I think I’ve got altitude sickness.”

“I don’t feel so great, either,” said Annie. “Try taking off your mask and goggles so you can breathe better.” She helped Jack lift off his mask and goggles. “Does that help?”

“Yeah, a little…” Jack took a deep breath. “But we need lots of help.”

“What do you mean?” said Annie.

“Help getting over altitude sickness,” said Jack, “help driving snowmobiles, help dodging lava bombs, help finding an ancient crown … and what is that, anyway—an ancient crown?”

Nancy poked her head back into the hut. “What’s up, guys? You coming?”

“Yikes,” said Annie.

Jack quickly tried to put his goggles and mask back on. But it was too late.

“What—what are you—who are you?” Nancy sputtered. “You’re not a journalist! You’re a kid!”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie in a deep voice. “He’s my son.”

“What?” said Nancy.

“He is,” said Annie. “I often take him on my assignments.”

“You what?” said Nancy.

“Annie, give it up,” said Jack. “We’re caught.”

“Oh, okay,” said Annie. She pushed up her goggles and pulled down her mask. “I’m Annie, and he’s Jack. We’re sister and brother.”

“I’m going to have a heart attack!” said Nancy. “What are you kids doing here?”

“We were looking for …” Annie stopped. “Um …” Jack knew even Annie couldn’t explain their mission to save Merlin to Nancy.

“This is unbelievable!” said Nancy. “I’ve got to get you two back to the station! Your parents must be frantic. I can’t believe this!”

“No, no, it’s our fault. No one will blame you,” said Jack.

But Nancy was pulling out a small radio. “Come in, Pete. Come in.”

The radio crackled and popped. Then Pete’s voice came through. “Hear you, Nancy,” he said.

“Pete, you need to get the chopper back here quick and pick up two of my group. They’re just little kids!”

Not so little, thought Jack.

“Repeat that, Nancy,” said Pete.

“Two little kids came with the group!” Nancy shouted. “I didn’t know they were kids—oh, it’s too hard to explain! Can you come back right away, please?”

“Sure thing,” said Pete. “You head up with the others. I’ll pick up the kids.”

“Thanks. They’ll be here at the hut, waiting for you to take them back,” said Nancy. “Over and out.”


6. All Fall Down


Demo version limitation



7. The Emperor

Clutching the wand, Jack lay in the pitch-dark. He pushed up his goggles, but he still couldn’t see anything.

“You there?” It was Annie’s voice.

“Yes,” said Jack.

“You okay?”

“Yes. But we’re really in trouble now,” said Jack. “We fell way down into a dark hole, and the wand doesn’t work.” He struggled to sit up.

“Well, maybe we should try again,” said Annie.

“What’s the point?” said Jack. “We’ll never get out of here now.”

Jack and Annie were silent for a moment.

“Hey—we’re moving!” Annie said.

“Moving?” said Jack. They were moving. The ice under them was gliding silently and smoothly through the darkness.

“What’s happening?” said Jack.

“Maybe we’re not in a hole,” said Annie. “Look, there’s light ahead.”

In the distance they saw a glimmer of light. As they kept moving, the light grew brighter. It grew brighter and brighter, until they slipped out of a dark tunnel into dazzling light.

Now Jack could see they were lying on a slab of ice, floating down a narrow river.

“We’re on an ice raft!” said Annie.

“What’s happening?” said Jack again.

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But I think maybe the wand did work.”

The ice raft floated through light and shadow, past tall frozen cliffs. Then it glided toward an archway in one of the cliff walls.

“Where are we going?” asked Jack.

The raft floated through the archway into a gigantic cavern. The cavern was like a huge icy cathedral. Its walls shone as if they were covered with silver.

“Ohhh,” whispered Annie.

“What is this place?” said Jack.

“I don’t know. But now I’m sure the wand worked,” said Annie.

The ice raft kept floating along a thin river inside the cavern, past icy archways and jagged ledges. Jack felt as if they were being watched. He thought he heard whispering and breathing.

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed to one of the cave openings. Standing on the ledge outside the cave entrance were two penguins. They looked just like the emperor penguins Jack and Annie had seen earlier.

Jack and Annie stood up so they could see better. As their raft floated toward the ledge, the penguin in front stepped back into the cave. The other didn’t move.

“Oh, man!” said Jack.

The penguin wore a glittering crown.

“The ancient crown,” Jack whispered. “We found it!”

Annie didn’t say anything. She just smiled as the ice raft floated straight toward the emperor penguin. It hit the ledge with a gentle bump.

“Hi,” Annie said simply.

The penguin made deep murmuring sounds. He didn’t speak in human speech. But somehow Jack and Annie could understand every word: Welcome to the Cave of the Ancient Crown.

Annie bowed. The penguin had such dignity, Jack bowed, too.

The emperor spoke again: Come. He beckoned with his wing, then turned.

Annie stepped off the ice raft onto the ledge and followed the emperor into the cave. Jack put the Wand of Dianthus into his pack. He hoisted the pack onto his back and tried to balance his weight so he could step from the raft to the ledge.

“Hurry!” said Annie, poking her head out of the cave.

“I’m coming!” said Jack. He leapt from the raft onto the ledge, then hurried into the cave.

The Cave of the Ancient Crown was sparkling. Icicles hung everywhere. Pillars of ice glimmered with blue light. From behind a row of ice pillars came the sound of music—strange music, unlike any Jack had ever heard before. It sounded like the music of a thousand icicle wind chimes.

The emperor led Jack and Annie around the pillars.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie.

Penguin couples were dancing to the strange music on a glittering ice rink. Pink and blue lights spilled over the dancers as they gracefully glided and turned. Some penguins danced silently with their eyes closed. Others touched beaks. A group of baby penguins danced together, hopping and sliding on the ice.



“How—how could this be happening?” stammered Jack.

“Don’t ask,” whispered Annie. “It’s magic.”

A murmur went through the ballroom as the penguins began to notice Jack and Annie. Though the strange music kept playing, all the dancers came to a stop. None of the penguins seemed alarmed, though. They all looked at their visitors with calm, friendly faces.

The emperor spoke to Jack and Annie: Word reached us earlier that you saved one of our own. We have been hoping to meet you.

Puzzled, Jack looked at Annie.

“When we first got here, remember?” she whispered.

“Oh, right,” said Jack. He’d forgotten all about rescuing the small penguin from the petrel.

You may stay with us for as long as you wish, said the emperor. You are honored members of our tribe now.

“Thank you,” said Annie. “But we can’t stay long. We came to Antarctica to look for a secret of happiness.”

“To save one of our friends,” said Jack. It felt natural to tell the emperor and his tribe the truth. They lived in a world as magical as the world of Camelot. “His name is Merlin. He’s the magician of Camelot, and he’s really sad.”

The penguins began murmuring and whispering to one another. Jack couldn’t understand what they were saying. From the back of the crowd, a baby penguin waddled forward, the tiniest one in the tribe.

“Oh, look …,” breathed Annie.

Jack grinned from ear to ear. The baby was a fuzzy gray ball with big dark eyes. It was even smaller than the young penguin they had saved from the petrel. The little penguin waddled up to the emperor.

Peep, peep, she said.

The emperor looked down at her.

Peep, peep.

She says she wishes to go with you, said the emperor. She wants to help your friend.

“But she’s so little!” said Annie. “What about her mom and dad?”

She is an orphan, said the emperor. Her parents were lost in a terrible storm. But she is very brave and full of joy. I know that she will bring happiness to your friend Merlin.

Annie turned to the baby penguin. “Thank you,” she said. Then she leaned over and patted the penguin’s tiny head. “Oh, touch her, Jack. She’s so soft.”

Jack patted the baby on the head, too. As he touched her soft little feathers, she tilted her head and stared at him with her big eyes. Jack felt a wave of tenderness for the baby penguin. He couldn’t believe she was an orphan. Tears came to his eyes, but he quickly blinked them away and cleared his throat. “Thanks, Penny,” he said.

Annie giggled. Jack couldn’t believe he’d just named the little penguin Penny. Usually Annie was the one who named the animals.



Peep, said Penny.

She would like you to pick her up, said the emperor.

“Oh. Okay,” said Jack. He leaned over and held out his arms. Penny snuggled close to his parka.

Peep!

Jack laughed and picked Penny up. He held the little penguin tightly.

The emperor turned to the crowd. He said something Jack couldn’t understand. The crowd parted to make a path. The emperor nodded at Jack and Annie. Let us go now, he said. As Jack, Annie, and Penny left with the emperor, the penguins flapped their wings against their bodies, applauding.

“Good-bye!” Annie called to the crowd.

Jack smiled and waved.

Peep! said Penny.

The icicle chime music grew softer and softer as Jack and Annie followed the emperor through the cave.

The tall penguin led them outside onto the ledge.

Thank you for your help today, he said.

“Thank you for letting Penny come with us,” said Annie.

“We promise to take good care of her. We’ll take her to Merlin,” said Jack.

The emperor touched the orphan’s downy head with the tip of his wing. He leaned close to her and softly murmured something in her ear.

Peep, Penny said.

The emperor looked up at Jack and Annie. Silently, he bowed to them and they bowed back. Then the emperor penguin turned and walked back into the Cave of the Ancient Crown.

Jack sighed. For a moment, he hated to leave the enchanted world of the penguins.

“Oh, she’s cold, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack looked down. Penny was shivering in his arms.

“Put her inside your parka,” said Annie.

Jack unzipped his parka and carefully placed the little penguin against his sweater. He pulled the zipper back up. He held Penny close to him.

“Perfect,” said Annie. “Just make sure she can breathe okay.”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack, patting his jacket. “I’ll take good care of her.”

“Do you think we can use the wand now to get back?” asked Annie.

Jack nodded. “I think so,” he said. “I can’t think of any other way.”

“Should we tell it to take us to the tree house?” asked Annie. “Or Frog Creek? Or Camelot?”

“No, we have to go back to Mount Erebus first,” said Jack. “If Nancy finds out that Pete never picked us up, she really will have a heart attack.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie. “Then we better put on our masks and goggles again.”

Jack pulled up his face mask and pulled down his goggles. “Get the wand out of my pack,” he said.

Annie reached into Jack’s backpack and pulled out the Wand of Dianthus. “Okay, ready?” she said.

Jack patted his parka, comforting the baby penguin. “Here we go, Penny,” he said, “on a big adventure.”

Annie held up the wand, then took a deep breath and said, “TAKE US BACK TO NANCY!”

In less than an instant, Jack and Annie and Penny were on the slope of Mount Erebus.


8. A Good Story


The snowmobiles and the helicopter were both parked on the slope. The scientists and journalists stood talking with Nancy and Pete.

“Oh, no!” Annie said, grabbing Jack. “What about Penny? We’re not supposed to have a penguin! They’ll take her away!”

Jack put his arms protectively over his parka. “I’ll hide her,” he said. “We’ve got to get her to Merlin.”

Jack heard a shout. He turned around. Nancy had caught sight of them. She was waving her arms and running toward them.

“Hey, you two!” Nancy called. She dashed across the snow and threw her arms around Annie, then Jack.

Jack held his breath, hoping Penny wouldn’t be squashed.

Peep.

Jack pulled away from Nancy and pretended to cough. He made his coughing end in a sort of peep.

“The chopper just got here!” said Nancy. “Pete told me he was delayed by a snow squall! I freaked out! Where have you been? Are you okay?”

“Don’t worry, we’re fine,” said Annie.

“Perfect,” said Jack. “We don’t feel a bit sick or anything. We were just getting some fresh air. We’re ready to go now!” Jack started walking toward the chopper.

Annie grabbed Nancy’s arm and walked with her. “Did you have fun on the mountain?” Annie asked, trying to keep Nancy’s attention off Jack. “What happened? What did you see?”

“We saw lots of things, but I was worried about you guys the whole time,” said Nancy. “Your parents must be frantic back at the station!”

“They had their own expedition today,” said Annie. “They study penguins.”

Peep!

“What was that?” asked Nancy.

Jack did his weird cough again.

“Are you sure you’re okay, Jack?” Nancy called after him.

“I’m perfect,” he said.

As the three of them approached the others, they were greeted with cheers. Nancy must have told everyone that we’re just little kids, Jack thought.

“So glad you’re safe, young man!” said Ali, the biologist. He slapped Jack on the back.

Penny peeped, and Jack coughed.

“Sorry you couldn’t make it up to the top,” said Kim, the photographer.

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “We still got a good story.”

“Did you now?” said Lucy, the space scientist.

“Yes, a really good story!” said Annie.

“Excellent, but you mustn’t tell a soul,” said Tony, the journalist, “or one of us will steal it!” Tony laughed, and the others laughed with him.

“Okay, we’ll keep it a secret.” Annie smiled.

Pete opened the door of the chopper.

“Brave little kids first,” said Nancy.

Oh, brother, thought Jack.

Nancy ushered Jack and Annie toward the helicopter. They scrambled up the steps, climbed aboard, and sat down.

As the others climbed in and got settled, Jack loosened his seat belt so he could buckle up without crushing Penny.

Peep!

Jack coughed. But to his relief, Pete started the engine. The rotor blades began to spin.

“Headphones!” yelled Nancy.

Everyone pulled on their headphones.

Nancy gave Jack and Annie a big smile and a thumbs-up sign as the helicopter lifted off the mountain slope.

“I love late spring evenings in Antarctica,” Nancy said to the group.

Jack looked out the window. The evening sky was lavender with streaks of pink.

“This light always reminds me that we’re in a different world from the world back home,” said Nancy.

Jack and Annie smiled at each other. If only the others knew how many different worlds there really were.

The chopper swept up through the soft light of the cold sky,

up the slope of the burning mountain,

past the orange-red lake of boiling lava,

over white fields of ice and snow,

until finally it landed at the heliport, where the

red bus was waiting.

The chopper blades stopped spinning. Pete gave the signal. Then Jack and Annie followed Nancy and the others out of the helicopter.

Jack held Penny in place under his parka as he boarded the red bus. He sat with Annie near the back.

Nancy took the driver’s seat and started the engine. As the bus rolled along, Jack peeked inside his parka. Penny looked up at him. She blinked a few times, as if she was a little worried. Jack patted her gently until she closed her eyes and fell asleep.

Jack kept patting the front of his parka to comfort Penny. He looked out the window and patted the baby penguin the whole ride. As Penny snuggled close to Jack, none of his worries of the day mattered anymore: his fear of falling into the lava lake, his dread of altitude sickness, his embarrassment at being caught by Nancy. All the cares and confusions of the day were wiped away by his feelings for the orphan penguin.



When the red bus stopped at the station, Jack and Annie followed everyone down the aisle and climbed off. As the others stood talking in a group, Jack and Annie started walking away.

“We’re leaving now! Bye, Nancy!” said Annie. “Bye, everyone!”

“Thanks for everything!” called Jack.

“Oh, no you don’t!” said Nancy. She grabbed them both by the sleeves of their parkas. “I’m not letting you two out of my sight again, not until I hand-deliver you to your parents.”

“But—but … our parents are still on their penguin expedition,” said Annie.

“Then I’ll take you to where you’re staying,” said Nancy. “Come on.” Clutching their parkas, she started walking them toward the buildings. “You all must be staying at the wildlife quarters, right?”

“Uh—yes,” said Jack.

Nancy led Jack and Annie to a building at the edge of the compound. “Well, here you are. Home safe and sound.”

“Thanks!” said Annie.

“Bye!” said Jack. He was desperate to get away with Penny.

“Wait—” said Nancy.

Oh, no. What now? thought Jack.

“I’m still worried about you guys,” said Nancy. “Are your parents really here to study penguins? I want you to tell me the true story now.”

Annie heaved a sigh. “Okay. The true story is that Jack and I came alone to Antarctica in a magic tree house—”

“Annie!” said Jack.

But Annie kept talking. “It belongs to Morgan le Fay of Camelot. Morgan wants us to find the fourth secret of happiness for Merlin the magician. See, he’s very sad. And as soon as we leave Antarctica, we’re headed for Camelot to cheer him up.”

Nancy just stared at Annie. Jack held his breath, afraid Nancy would finally have her heart attack.

But Nancy burst out laughing and shook her head. “Where did that come from?” she said. “You guys are so cute! How do you think up this stuff? Seriously now, tell me the truth.”

“Well …,” started Jack.

“Oh, look!” said Annie. “Mom! Dad!”

“What?” said Jack.

“There they are!” said Annie. She pointed to a couple bundled up in parkas, goggles, and ski masks. They were walking toward a building.

“Oh—right!” said Jack. “Mom! Dad!”

The couple kept walking and disappeared behind the building.

“They didn’t hear us!” said Annie. “We better go! They’ll wonder where we are. Bye, Nancy! Thanks for everything!”

“Nancy, you coming with us for coffee?” Tony yelled, standing by the bus.

“You should go, Nancy,” said Annie. “We’ll be fine.”

“Okay,” said Nancy, sighing. “Bye, guys. Run and catch up with your folks.”

Peep!

Jack coughed his funny cough.

“And take care of that cough of yours, Jack!” said Nancy.

“Don’t worry, I will!” said Jack.

Then Jack and Annie took off. They ran behind the building. They stopped and peeked back around the corner. They watched Nancy walk off with Tony and the others.

“Let’s go,” said Jack. He and Annie hurried away from all the buildings at McMurdo Station.

Jack put his arms around Penny as they crossed the icy slope and ran to the cliff near the seashore.

The tree house was still there, tucked under the overhang. Annie climbed in through the window. Jack followed her, careful not to let Penny slip out of his parka.

Annie pulled Morgan’s rhyme out of her pocket and read the last part:

Then speed to Camelot by close of day,

Lest grief take Merlin forever away.

“Let’s go!” said Jack. “Speed to Camelot!”

Annie pointed to the word Camelot and said loudly and clearly: “I wish we could go there!”

A blast of light—

a roar of wind—

a rumble of thunder—

and, of course,

they were there.



9. Penny and Merlin

Peep.

Penny’s head was sticking out of Jack’s jacket. Jack and Annie were wearing their own clothes again—their jeans, jackets, hats, and scarves. All their heavy cold-weather gear for Antarctica was gone.

“We’re in Camelot,” said Annie, looking out the window.

Jack took Penny out of his jacket and held her up to the window so she could see the grounds of King Arthur’s castle.

The tree house had landed in an apple tree in an orchard. In the near distance, castle towers rose into a late-afternoon sky. Several knights on horses were riding away from the castle.

“Jack! Annie!”

Teddy and Kathleen were running through the orchard, between the trees, over fallen golden leaves and apples.

Jack and Annie waved at them.

“Oh, I just thought of something,” said Jack. “We forgot to find out the fourth secret.”

“What do you mean?” said Annie. “It’s Penny.”

“No, I don’t think so,” said Jack. “Remember, Leonardo da Vinci told us a secret of happiness has to be available to everyone. Not many people can have their own baby penguin.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

“Jack! Annie! Come down!” Teddy and Kathleen called from below.

“We’re coming!” said Annie.

Jack put Penny inside his jacket, then carefully climbed down the rope ladder after Annie.

“Oh! What did you bring back with you?” said Kathleen.

Penny was peeking out of Jack’s jacket again. “A baby penguin for Merlin,” said Annie.

“Look at her!” said Kathleen. “She’s beautiful!”

“Indeed!” said Teddy, petting Penny’s downy head.

Peep.

“She wants to help Merlin,” said Annie.

“Then let us hurry to him at once,” said Teddy. “Come, follow us.”

Kathleen and Teddy led the way between the trees to a small wooden cottage at the edge of the orchard.

“Merlin’s in there?” asked Jack.

“’Tis a garden house he always loved as a child,” said Teddy. “Morgan thought he would find comfort there. But alas, he seems to have found nothing but more grief. He will eat nothing, and he has not spoken for days.”

Teddy opened the door to the cottage and ushered Annie and Jack inside.

Morgan was sitting by Merlin’s bed. Late-afternoon light slanted through the window onto the magician’s face. He lay very still. His eyes were closed and his hands were folded on his chest.

A chill went through Jack. Merlin hardly looked alive.

Morgan turned around. She, too, looked tired, but her face brightened when she saw Jack and Annie. “Thank goodness you have come!” she said.

Annie crossed the room and hugged Morgan. Jack stepped forward with Penny. “Look what we brought for Merlin,” he whispered.

“Oh!” said Morgan. The enchantress gently touched the little penguin. “She is lovely indeed,” she whispered. “Thank you for bringing her.”

Morgan turned back to Merlin. “Merlin?” she said. “Jack and Annie from Frog Creek are here. They want to talk with you.”

Annie stepped forward, while Jack stood in the shadows with Penny. “Hi, Merlin!” said Annie. “How are you doing?”

The magician didn’t open his eyes. But he nodded to let Annie know he heard her.

“We have four secrets of happiness to share with you,” said Annie. She reached into Jack’s backpack. She pulled out the poem that the poet Basho had given them on their trip to old Japan.

“Listen, here’s a poem from a man named Basho,” said Annie. She read the short poem:

An old pond:

a frog jumps in—

the sound of water.

“The secret of happiness for Basho was that he paid attention to small things in nature,” explained Annie.

Merlin nodded slowly. “Nature,” he said in a raspy voice.

“That’s right,” said Annie. “And we brought you this, too.” She pulled out the angel picture Leonardo da Vinci had drawn. She held it up to show Merlin.

“This is an angel drawn by a great genius named Leonardo da Vinci,” said Annie.

Merlin opened his eyes and peered at the drawing.

“Isn’t she beautiful?” said Annie. “The secret of Leonardo’s happiness was that he had great curiosity about everything—angels, art, noses, feathers, flowers, flying. Every day he felt happy when he learned something new.”

Merlin nodded as he stared at the angel sketch. “Curiosity,” he breathed.

“Yes. And here’s the third secret,” said Annie. She reached into Jack’s pack and pulled out the nautilus shell they’d been given on their trip to the deep ocean.

“A sea creature once lived inside this shell,” said Annie. “We learned from an ocean scientist that a secret of happiness is having compassion for all living things, from a tiny shell creature to a giant octopus.”

Merlin took the shell from Annie. He cupped his hands around it and closed his eyes. His face softened. “Compassion,” he said. But still he didn’t smile.

Jack sighed. Maybe Merlin isn’t going to get better, he thought.

“Give him Penny now, Jack,” whispered Annie.

Jack stepped out from the shadows.

“Merlin,” he said, “we don’t actually know what the fourth secret of happiness is, but we want to give you something else.”

Merlin looked at Jack.

Jack held up the tiny penguin. “Her name is Penny,” he said.

Merlin just stared at Penny. He looked confused.

“She’s an orphan,” said Jack. “Her parents were lost in a terrible storm.”

Merlin frowned. “She is very small,” he said hoarsely.

“Yes. And she wants to live with you,” said Annie.

“The emperor of the Cave of the Ancient Crown wants you to take care of her,” said Jack. “He says she is very brave and full of joy.”

Jack set Penny on the floor. Standing alone, the penguin looked tiny and fragile.

“Go to Merlin,” Jack urged Penny.

Penny waddled across the floor to Merlin. Her little body rocked stiffly from side to side as she held out her wings to keep her balance.

Penny stopped in front of Merlin. The little penguin and the old magician stared at each other for a moment. Merlin’s expression didn’t change.

Peep! said Penny. Peep! Peep!

Merlin’s face twitched. Then he began to laugh. At first his laughter seemed more like coughing than laughing, as if he hadn’t laughed in a long time. But then his laughter grew louder. He stood up and scooped the baby penguin into his arms.

Merlin hugged Penny to his chest, pressing her against his long white beard. His face settled into a warm smile.



“It is your destiny to care for her, Merlin,” said Morgan. “The emperor of the Cave of the Ancient Crown has sent her to you. He is very wise.”

Merlin nodded. Then, cradling Penny in his arms, he walked to the doorway of the cottage and looked out. “The air smells like ripe apples and wood smoke today,” he said.

“Yes, my old friend, it does,” said Morgan. She wiped tears from her eyes.

Merlin turned back and looked at Jack and Annie. “Thank you for bringing—What did you say her name was?”

“Penny,” said Annie.

“Ah, yes, Penny … to me,” said Merlin. “And thank you for your other gifts as well. I will never forget the secrets you have shared with me.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack and Annie.

Peep.

“Yes, yes,” Merlin murmured to the baby penguin. “You will stay with me. And we will have a happy time together. Let us go into the orchard and I will show you the rising moon.”

Merlin put Penny down on the ground. The baby penguin took tiny quick steps alongside the magician as they walked into the orchard. The two strolled together between the trees, and a round moon rose over the kingdom of Camelot.


10. The Secret


“Well done,” Teddy said softly.

“Indeed,” said Kathleen, smiling at Jack and Annie.

Morgan smiled at them, too. “Thank you for your four secrets,” she said.

“You’re welcome,” said Annie. “But we’re not exactly sure what the fourth secret is.”

“I told Annie I don’t think it can be a baby penguin,” said Jack. “Because in our time people aren’t allowed to have baby penguins.”

“That is true,” said Morgan. “But people can always take care of someone—or some creature—who needs them.”

“So that’s the secret?” said Annie.

Morgan nodded. “Taking loving care of another can make one very happy,” she said. “Like the other three secrets, it helps us look outside ourselves. Then we can better see all the gifts the world has to offer.”

“Yeah, taking care of Penny really took my attention off myself,” Jack said. “I forgot about a million things I was worried about.”

“I know you will miss her,” said Morgan. “But I imagine you will see her again someday.”

“So are we going on another mission soon?” asked Annie.

“Return home and rest first, and we will send for you again,” said Morgan.

“Can you try to make it really soon?” said Annie. “We don’t like long rests.”

Morgan laughed. “We will see,” she said.

“Oh, before we leave, I want to take a picture of you three guys,” said Annie. “It’s for my family project at school. You seem like a family to me. Look this way, please.”

Annie aimed her camera at Morgan, Teddy, and Kathleen. “Smile!” she said.

“What are you doing?” asked Teddy. “What are you holding?”

“It’s a camera,” said Annie. “Just smile. Say cheese.”

“Cheese? Why ‘cheese’?” said Teddy.

Click! Flash!

“Got it.” Annie put her camera back into her pocket.

“What was that? What did you do?” asked Teddy.

“It’s hard to explain,” said Jack. “It’s like magic. From our time.”

“Good-bye now,” said Morgan, smiling. “Have a safe journey home to your family.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“See all you guys again soon—real soon, we hope!” said Annie.

“We hope so, too!” said Teddy.

“Good-bye,” said Kathleen.

Jack and Annie left the garden cottage and hurried back to the tree house.

They climbed up the rope ladder. Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book and opened it to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“Wait, I see Merlin and Penny! Look!” Annie pointed toward Merlin in the distance. He was still walking through the apple orchard with Penny at his side.

“They look like a little family now, too,” said Jack.

“Yeah, they do. I should take their picture,” said Annie. She aimed her camera at Merlin and Penny and took a picture. Then she sighed. “Okay, home now.”

“Bye, Penny,” Jack said softly. Then he pointed in the book to the words Frog Creek. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



“We’re home,” Annie said. “That was a great trip.” She and Jack were back in the Frog Creek woods.

“Yeah. I hope we see Penny on our next mission,” said Jack.

“If we see Merlin, we’ll probably see Penny,” said Annie. “I think those two are a team now. At least we have a picture of them—and a picture of Teddy, Kathleen, and Morgan.”

Annie held up her camera and clicked through the photo display. “Oh, no!” she said. “I don’t believe it!”

“What?” said Jack.

“All my pictures are gone!” said Annie. “No Antarctica! No Merlin or Morgan! No penguins!”

“Really?” said Jack. “Maybe you can’t keep the pictures you take on a magical trip.”

“I think you’re right,” said Annie. “I only have one picture. I took it right before we left home.” She held up her camera to show Jack. It was a picture of him. He had a grin on his face.

“That’s when I saw the streak of light over the woods,” said Jack, “and I knew the tree house was back.”

“Well, at least I captured that moment,” said Annie, sighing.

“Yep.” Jack put the Antarctica book on the floor of the tree house and pulled on his pack. Then he climbed down the rope ladder. Annie followed. As they started tramping over the fallen leaves, the woods were growing dark. Jack felt a little cold and hungry.

“So the fourth secret is take care of someone who needs you,” said Annie. “I guess that could mean lots of things. Like take care of a sad person, a baby, a puppy, or a new kid in school …”

Jack nodded. “Yep,” he said. “And maybe it works the other way, too.”

“What do you mean?” said Annie.

“I think sometimes you can make other people happy by letting them take care of you,” Jack said.

“Oh, right,” said Annie. “It seems to make Mom and Dad happy to take care of us.”

“Like when they tell us to wear scarves and gloves,” said Jack.

“And make us dinner,” said Annie.

“And tell us to be home before dark,” said Jack.

“We better hurry,” said Annie.

“Yep, let’s go make Mom and Dad happy—” said Jack, laughing.

“By letting them take care of us!” said Annie.

The wind shook the tree limbs, and leaves fluttered to the ground. Geese honked overhead as Jack and Annie hurried home through the chilly November twilight.


More Facts About Antarctica


• Today Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent in the world.

• The land area of Antarctica is more than 5 million square miles.

• More than 99 percent of Antarctica is covered with thick ice.

• Ninety percent of all the world’s ice can be found in Antarctica.

• In winter, the sea around Antarctica freezes and the continent becomes much bigger.

• Much of the land is unreachable by humans in winter.

• Mount Erebus is the most active volcano in Antarctica, with daily eruptions.

• Mount Erebus was named after Erebus, a god from Greek mythology who was the son of Chaos. Erebus was the god of darkness, and Antarctica is in darkness for much of the year.

• The continent of Antarctica was first seen by humans less than 200 years ago.

• In the twentieth century, more than forty permanent stations were built in Antarctica by people from many countries.

• For over fifty years, the United States has had a full-time research site called McMurdo Station.





• There are six kinds of penguins in Antarctica: the Adélie, chinstrap, gentoo, macaroni, king, and emperor.

• Only emperor penguins can winter on Antarctica, because only they can survive the cold.

• In the winter, thousands of emperor penguins march inland and create colonies on the ice of Antarctica. There the female penguin lays her egg. Then she marches north back to the sea to get food for her chick.

• While the female is gone, the male penguin stays with the egg and protects it from the brutal weather. For the next two months, the male penguins all huddle together against the howling winds. Not until their mates finally return do the hungry males head to the sea to eat.

Jack was sitting at the computer in the living room. He was doing research on penguins for a school project. His mom and dad were cooking in the kitchen. Jack could smell bread baking in the oven and spaghetti sauce bubbling on top of the stove.

“Jack!” Annie burst into the living room. “Come with me!” she said.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“They’re here!” said Annie.

“Teddy? Kathleen?” asked Jack.

Annie nodded, her eyes shining.

“Oh, man!” Jack whispered. He jumped up from his chair and grabbed his jacket and backpack. “Mom, Dad—we’ll be back soon!” he called.

“Dinner’s in thirty minutes,” their mom called from the kitchen.

“No problem!” said Annie. Then she and Jack headed out the front door into the cool spring air.

“Where did you see them?” said Jack.

“At the edge of the woods!” said Annie. “I was riding my bike home from my piano lesson. When they saw me, they waved.”

“You didn’t stop and talk to them?” said Jack.

“No, I pointed to the house,” said Annie, “to let them know I had to get you first.”

“Oh! Thanks!” said Jack. “We’d better hurry!”

“I wonder where they’re sending us!” said Annie as they crossed their yard and headed up the sidewalk. “I wonder what our next mission is! Hey, did you bring the Wand of Dianthus?”

“Yep, it’s in my backpack!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran into the Frog Creek woods. They hurried through the shadowy light of late afternoon, until they came to the tallest tree. Jack looked up. The tree house was back. The two young enchanters from Camelot were looking out the window.

“Hi!” yelled Jack and Annie.

“Hello!” Teddy and Kathleen shouted.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up into the tree house. Jack followed.

“We’re so glad you’re back!” said Annie. She hugged Teddy and Kathleen. Jack hugged them, too.

“How’s Penny?” Jack asked. He’d been missing the little penguin they had given Merlin on their last adventure.

“Oh, Penny and Merlin have become the best of friends,” said Kathleen. “She has brought him much joy and laughter.”

“Cool,” said Jack. He wasn’t surprised. Penny had made him really happy, too.

“What do you want us to do now?” said Annie.

“On your last missions, you found secrets of happiness to help Merlin,” said Kathleen.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Now, on your next mission, Merlin wants you to help bring happiness to millions of people,” said Kathleen.

“Whoa,” said Jack. “That’s a big job.”

Teddy and Kathleen laughed.

“How do we do that?” asked Jack.

“Simple,” said Teddy. “You must seek out a brilliant artist—”

“Do you mean like a painter?” asked Annie.

“It could be,” said Teddy. “But it could also be any person who uses passion and imagination to create something beautiful.”

“Merlin wants you to help put that artist on the right path,” said Teddy, “to share his or her gifts with the world.”

“Oh, cool!” said Annie. “Where do we start?”

Kathleen took a creamy white envelope from her cloak. It was sealed with melted red wax. In fancy writing, it said: For Jack and Annie of Frog Creek. “‘Tis a royal invitation,” said Kathleen.

Jack took the envelope. He carefully broke the seal and pulled out a thick card with gold edges and gold script. He read aloud:

“A party at a summer palace! In 1762!” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Teddy. “The palace is in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most splendid palaces in all the world.”

“That sounds like fun,” said Annie.

“Indeed, it should be,” said Kathleen. “But you must watch your manners. And beware of unexpected dangers.”

“What kind of dangers?” asked Jack.

“I do not know,” said Kathleen. “But Merlin believes you will need magic to keep safe. Did you bring the Wand of Dianthus?”

“Yes,” said Jack. He reached into his backpack and pulled out the silvery wand. It was shaped like the horn of a unicorn.

Kathleen took the wand from Jack. She closed her eyes and spun it through the air, as if she were spinning a baton. In a blur of light and movement, the wand changed into a small silver flute.

“Wow,” said Annie.



“A flute?” asked Jack.

“A magic flute,” said Teddy. “Playing this flute will deliver you from danger.”

“But Jack and I don’t know how to play the flute,” said Annie.

“Do not worry,” said Kathleen. “If the time is right, the flute will make its own music.”

“Just blow over the mouthpiece,” said Teddy. “And while one of you plays, the other must make up a song. Whatever you sing will come true.”

“Cool!” said Annie.

“But when your song has ended, the flute’s magic will end, too,” said Kathleen. “You can only use the flute’s magic once, so choose the time wisely.”

“Okay, got it!” said Annie.

“Are you ready to go?” asked Kathleen.

“Uh, wait,” said Jack. “Party invitation … magic flute … Is that all? Don’t you have a research book for us?”

“On this journey, Merlin wants you to rely only on your wits and your talents,” said Teddy.

“Oh. Okay,” said Jack, though he wasn’t sure he had many talents.

“Tell the magic tree house where to go by pointing to the words on the invitation,” said Kathleen.

Annie pointed to the words Summer Palace. But before she made her wish, she looked at Teddy and Kathleen. “I hope we see you again very soon,” she said. “Say hi to Merlin and Morgan when you go back to Camelot.”

“And Penny, too,” said Jack.

Kathleen and Teddy both smiled.

“Yes, we will,” said Teddy.

Annie took a deep breath. “Okay. I wish we could go there!” she said. “To the summer palace!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

I’ve always wanted Jack and Annie to go to the country of Austria, and now, finally, they do in Moonlight on the Magic Flute. When I was a small child, my family lived in Austria for three years. Our home was in Salzburg, a beautiful old town situated on the banks of a river and surrounded by mountains. Best of all, a huge castle sits on a hilltop in Salzburg overlooking the town. I could see the castle from the windows of our house!

Living in Austria was like living in a fairy tale. I’m certain it gave me my love of fairy tales and folklore, and it also gave me the feeling from a very early age that everyday life has a touch of magic to it. So I hope that now you, too, will have a great trip to this country that meant so much to me a long time ago.

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next eight Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history: Venice, Baghdad, Paris, New York City, Tokyo, Florence, the deep ocean, and Antarctica. After proving to Merlin that they could use magic wisely, they were awarded the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that helped them make their own magic. With the wand, Jack and Annie were able to find four secrets of happiness to help Merlin when he was in trouble.

Now Jack and Annie are waiting to hear from Merlin again….


1. To the Summer Palace


Jack was sitting at the computer in the living room. He was doing research on penguins for a school project. His mom and dad were cooking in the kitchen. Jack could smell bread baking in the oven and spaghetti sauce bubbling on top of the stove.

“Jack!” Annie burst into the living room. “Come with me!” she said.

“What’s going on?” said Jack.

“They’re here!” said Annie.

“Teddy? Kathleen?” asked Jack.

Annie nodded, her eyes shining.

“Oh, man!” Jack whispered. He jumped up from his chair and grabbed his jacket and backpack. “Mom, Dad—we’ll be back soon!” he called.

“Dinner’s in thirty minutes,” their mom called from the kitchen.

“No problem!” said Annie. Then she and Jack headed out the front door into the cool spring air.

“Where did you see them?” said Jack.

“At the edge of the woods!” said Annie. “I was riding my bike home from my piano lesson. When they saw me, they waved.”

“You didn’t stop and talk to them?” said Jack.

“No, I pointed to the house,” said Annie, “to let them know I had to get you first.”

“Oh! Thanks!” said Jack. “We’d better hurry!”

“I wonder where they’re sending us!” said Annie as they crossed their yard and headed up the sidewalk. “I wonder what our next mission is! Hey, did you bring the Wand of Dianthus?”

“Yep, it’s in my backpack!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran into the Frog Creek woods. They hurried through the shadowy light of late afternoon, until they came to the tallest tree. Jack looked up. The tree house was back. The two young enchanters from Camelot were looking out the window.

“Hi!” yelled Jack and Annie.

“Hello!” Teddy and Kathleen shouted.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up into the tree house. Jack followed.

“We’re so glad you’re back!” said Annie. She hugged Teddy and Kathleen. Jack hugged them, too.

“How’s Penny?” Jack asked. He’d been missing the little penguin they had given Merlin on their last adventure.

“Oh, Penny and Merlin have become the best of friends,” said Kathleen. “She has brought him much joy and laughter.”

“Cool,” said Jack. He wasn’t surprised. Penny had made him really happy, too.

“What do you want us to do now?” said Annie.

“On your last missions, you found secrets of happiness to help Merlin,” said Kathleen.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Now, on your next mission, Merlin wants you to help bring happiness to millions of people,” said Kathleen.

“Whoa,” said Jack. “That’s a big job.”

Teddy and Kathleen laughed.

“How do we do that?” asked Jack.

“Simple,” said Teddy. “You must seek out a brilliant artist—”

“Do you mean like a painter?” asked Annie.

“It could be,” said Teddy. “But it could also be any person who uses passion and imagination to create something beautiful.”

“Merlin wants you to help put that artist on the right path,” said Teddy, “to share his or her gifts with the world.”

“Oh, cool!” said Annie. “Where do we start?”

Kathleen took a creamy white envelope from her cloak. It was sealed with melted red wax. In fancy writing, it said: For Jack and Annie of Frog Creek. “‘Tis a royal invitation,” said Kathleen.

Jack took the envelope. He carefully broke the seal and pulled out a thick card with gold edges and gold script. He read aloud:

“A party at a summer palace! In 1762!” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Teddy. “The palace is in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most splendid palaces in all the world.”

“That sounds like fun,” said Annie.

“Indeed, it should be,” said Kathleen. “But you must watch your manners. And beware of unexpected dangers.”

“What kind of dangers?” asked Jack.

“I do not know,” said Kathleen. “But Merlin believes you will need magic to keep safe. Did you bring the Wand of Dianthus?”

“Yes,” said Jack. He reached into his backpack and pulled out the silvery wand. It was shaped like the horn of a unicorn.

Kathleen took the wand from Jack. She closed her eyes and spun it through the air, as if she were spinning a baton. In a blur of light and movement, the wand changed into a small silver flute.

“Wow,” said Annie.



“A flute?” asked Jack.

“A magic flute,” said Teddy. “Playing this flute will deliver you from danger.”

“But Jack and I don’t know how to play the flute,” said Annie.

“Do not worry,” said Kathleen. “If the time is right, the flute will make its own music.”

“Just blow over the mouthpiece,” said Teddy. “And while one of you plays, the other must make up a song. Whatever you sing will come true.”

“Cool!” said Annie.

“But when your song has ended, the flute’s magic will end, too,” said Kathleen. “You can only use the flute’s magic once, so choose the time wisely.”

“Okay, got it!” said Annie.

“Are you ready to go?” asked Kathleen.

“Uh, wait,” said Jack. “Party invitation … magic flute … Is that all? Don’t you have a research book for us?”

“On this journey, Merlin wants you to rely only on your wits and your talents,” said Teddy.

“Oh. Okay,” said Jack, though he wasn’t sure he had many talents.

“Tell the magic tree house where to go by pointing to the words on the invitation,” said Kathleen.

Annie pointed to the words Summer Palace. But before she made her wish, she looked at Teddy and Kathleen. “I hope we see you again very soon,” she said. “Say hi to Merlin and Morgan when you go back to Camelot.”

“And Penny, too,” said Jack.

Kathleen and Teddy both smiled.

“Yes, we will,” said Teddy.

Annie took a deep breath. “Okay. I wish we could go there!” she said. “To the summer palace!”

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Put On Your Wig!

Jack opened his eyes. He looked down at his clothes. He was wearing a blue velvet coat, a long vest, and knee-length pants. His shoes were black with shiny buckles.

Jack looked up at Annie and burst out laughing. Her pigtails had changed into thick, cigar-shaped curls. She was wearing a pink dress covered with lace and bows. There was a big hoop underneath her skirt to hold it out. The hoop, the skirt, and lots of petticoats were all bunched up around Annie.

“You look like you’re standing in a basket,” said Jack.

“You look like an old woman,” said Annie. She pointed at Jack’s head.

Jack reached up and lifted off a black velvet hat. But something else was on his head, too. He pulled off a white wig with curls on the side and a ponytail in the back.

“ A wig?” said Jack. His nose tickled. He sneezed, and a cloud of white powder puffed from his wig. “It’s covered in powder! I can’t wear this!”

“Yes, you can,” said Annie. “If I have to wear this“—she shook her dress—”you have to wear that.”

“But why are we dressed this way?” asked Jack.

“Because we’re going to a fancy party in a palace a long time ago,” said Annie.

“Okay, but where’s the palace?” said Jack.

Jack and Annie went to the window and looked out. They had landed in a row of trees that lined a cobblestone street. At the far end of the street, glittering horse-drawn coaches were parked outside tall iron gates.

“I wonder if the palace is beyond those gates,” said Annie, pointing.



“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I wish we had a research book to help us.”

“Merlin wants us to rely on our wits and talents,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “whatever that means.”

Bells rang in the distance: bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.

“Five bongs,” said Annie. “What time’s the party?”

Jack looked at their invitation and read aloud, “‘Five o’clock in the evening.’”

“Oh, no! We’re going to be late!” said Annie. “Put on your wig!”

Jack crammed his wig back onto his head and put on his hat. He pushed the silver flute and invitation into a deep pocket in his coat.

Annie squashed her hoopskirt and squeezed through the opening in the tree house floor. “It’s hard to climb down a rope ladder in this dress!” she said.

“Be careful! Go slow!” said Jack.

“But we have to hurry!” said Annie. She jumped off the ladder and landed on the ground.

Jack hurried down the ladder. “You okay?” he asked.

“I’m fine,” said Annie, standing up. “Just got a little dirty.” She brushed off her dress. “Let’s ask one of those guys about the palace.” She pointed toward the coach drivers outside the iron gates. “Hurry!”

Annie started to run. Her skirt swung wildly from side to side like a giant bell.

“Slow down!” said Jack, rushing to catch up with her. “You can’t run in that big skirt—you look ridiculous. Besides, we need to discuss our mission before we go to this party.”

“It’s simple,” said Annie. “We’re looking for a brilliant—”

“I know—artist,” finished Jack. “But how do we find this person?”

“We’ll get to that part soon enough,” said Annie. “First let’s find the party.”

Jack and Annie walked toward the fancy coaches parked near the gates. “Where’s our invitation?” asked Annie.

“Here.” Jack pulled the invitation out of his pocket.

“Excuse me,” said Annie, walking up to the driver of a golden coach pulled by two white horses. “We’re looking for the summer palace.” Jack showed their invitation to the man.

The driver nodded approvingly. “Ah, so you are guests of the imperial family!” he said. “But why are you arriving on foot? Where is your coach?”

“Um, our driver let us out back there,” said Annie, pointing down the street.

“I fear he let you out too soon,” said the driver. “You still have quite a distance to go.”

“ We do?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said the driver. “I have already delivered my employer and his family to the palace. I was waiting here until the party ended. But if you like, I can take you there. Young nobles should always arrive by coach.”

“Oh, thanks!” said Annie.

Jack straightened his shoulders and tried to look noble.

“My name is Josef,” said the man. “Come, let me help you up.” Josef held out his hand. Annie took it, and Josef helped her up onto a cushioned leather seat.

Josef helped Jack up, too. Then the friendly driver climbed onto a bench behind the milk white horses.

“Wow, I feel like Cinderella going to the ball,” Annie said to Jack.

Josef snapped the reins. The horses took off, and the guards opened the gates. The coach clattered over the cobblestones into an immense square.

The square was bathed in the last light of day. Monks in brown robes strolled around a huge fountain. Soldiers in uniforms rode on horseback. On the far side of the square was a long building. It had bright yellow walls and dozens of windows that flashed with the light of the setting sun.

“Is that the summer palace, sir?” Annie called to Josef.

“Yes, indeed,” Josef said over his shoulder. “And there is much more that you cannot see! Behind the palace is a garden of nearly three hundred acres. It has beautiful flowers, orchards, fountains, and a zoo.”

“A zoo?” said Jack.



“Hello, boy and girl!” came a high little voice. A closed blue coach passed them. A small boy wearing a white wig was calling from a window. He pointed at Jack and laughed. “Your wig is crooked!” he shouted in his high voice.

Before the boy could say more, someone pulled him back from the window, and the blue coach rumbled away.

“What an annoying kid,” said Jack. “Is my wig crooked?”

“A little.” Annie lifted Jack’s hat off. She tried to straighten his wig as they lurched and swayed on the cushioned seat. “There,” she said. “That’s better.”

Josef drove the horses to the front of the palace. The coach stopped near a staircase that led up to a terrace. Josef helped Jack and Annie down from their seat.

“I can tell this is your first visit to the palace,” said Josef. “At the door, you must show the guard in the red uniform your invitation. He will direct you to the receiving line.”

“The receiving line? What’s that?” said Jack.

“That is where you will wait to be introduced,” said Josef.

“Introduced to who?” asked Jack.

“To Her Imperial Majesty Maria Theresa. She is Archduchess of Austria; Queen of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia; and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire,” said Josef.

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

Yeah, right, thought Jack. Help!


3. Her Imperial Majesty


“Thanks for your help, Josef,” said Annie.

“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Jack.

“You’re very welcome,” said Josef. “I hope you will enjoy yourselves at the party.”

“ We will,” said Annie. “Bye.”

As the coachman climbed back into his carriage, Annie turned to Jack. “This is so cool!” she said.

Not really, thought Jack. He didn’t know how he was supposed to act with Her Imperial Majesty whatever-the-rest-of-her-name-was! His hands felt clammy. “What do we do when we meet her? What do we say?” he asked.

“ We just watch what other people do,” said Annie, “and we copy them. Come on.”

Jack and Annie walked over to the sweeping stairway. They started up the steps, following the other party guests. The women all wore glittering jewels and gowns with giant hoopskirts. The men wore wigs with white curls flowing down over the collars of their long coats. All the clothes were made of silk and satin and velvet in rich colors and patterns.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

“What?” said Annie.

“There’s that kid who yelled at me,” Jack said.

The small boy from the blue coach was standing at the top of the stairs. He wore a lilac-colored coat with gold braid. A tiny sword hung from his side.

“A sword?” said Jack. “That’s ridiculous. He can’t be more than four or five years old.”

The boy turned and caught sight of Jack and Annie. A big smile crossed his round face. He waved at them.

“He’s cute,” said Annie. She waved back.

“Not really,” said Jack.

A man grabbed the boy’s hand and pulled him into the palace.

“And he thought I looked funny,” said Jack. “How’s my wig now?”

Annie giggled. “It’s crooked again,” she said. “And your ears are poking out. Hold on.”

Jack and Annie stopped on the stairs. Annie grabbed both sides of Jack’s wig and gave it a good yank.

“Move along, children. You’re holding up the line!” a woman behind them said.

Annie picked up her hoopskirt, and she and Jack hurried up the stairs. At the top, Jack pulled their invitation out of his pocket again. He led Annie into the palace and showed the invitation to a guard in a red uniform.

“Follow the line through the lantern room and into the Great Rosa Room,” the guard said.

Jack saw a line of party guests walking slowly through a candlelit room. He and Annie quickly joined the line. The room was filled with sounds of whispering and the rustling of silk.

A young girl in a white dress with red roses was standing near Jack and Annie. When the line moved, Jack waited for the girl to go ahead.

The girl smiled. “I’m not in line,” she said in a soft voice. “I’m waiting for my brother.”

Jack nodded, and he and Annie stepped forward. Jack craned his neck to get a better view inside the Great Rosa Room. He couldn’t see Her Imperial Majesty yet, but he could see part of the fancy room with its red velvet chairs and gold-trimmed, glossy white walls.

Another guest entered the Great Rosa Room, and Jack and Annie took a step closer to the door. Now Jack could see Her Imperial Majesty. She was a tall, plump woman dressed in a blue silk gown with ruffles. To Jack’s surprise, the little kid with the sword was sitting on her lap! A long row of older children stood behind her.

Jack turned to Annie. “Who do you think those kids are?” he asked.

Annie shrugged.

“They are the children of Her Imperial Majesty,” said the girl who had spoken to Jack earlier. “The imperial children.”

“Thanks,” said Annie.

“The imperial children look pretty unfriendly,” Jack whispered to Annie. The little boy with the sword was the only one smiling.

“Well, it must be really hard to just stand there wearing stiff clothes and wigs while people are being received,” Annie whispered back.

“Prepare yourselves. You are next,” a servant at the door said to Jack and Annie.

Oh, no! thought Jack. He’d been too busy looking at the imperial children to watch the guests in front of him. “What do we do when we meet Her Imperial Majesty?” he asked Annie frantically.

“I don’t know! I forgot to watch!” she said. Annie turned to the girl in the white dress. “Um— excuse me? Can you tell us what to do when we meet Her Imperial Majesty?” she asked.

The girl leaned close to Annie and whispered, “Enter the room and announce your names. Then walk to the middle of the room. You must curtsy; he must bow. Next go directly up to Her Imperial Majesty and do the same.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

“Oh, and remember—” the girl said to Jack, “do not rise from the second bow until Her Imperial Majesty tells you to. Do not even look up. Rise only when she says ‘rise.’ Then step backward out of the room.”

“Backward?” said Jack.

“Yes. You must never turn your back on Her Imperial Majesty,” said the girl. “It would be considered very bad manners.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He was grateful to the girl for giving them such important information.

The servant at the door turned and nodded to Jack and Annie. The two of them stepped into the Great Rosa Room.

“Annie of Frog Creek!” Annie said loudly.

“Jack, also of Frog Creek!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie walked slowly to the center of the room; Her Imperial Majesty and the imperial children watched them closely. The little boy with the sword waved at them. Annie curtsied and Jack gave a low bow.

Then Jack and Annie walked closer to Her Imperial Majesty. She had a double chin, a high forehead, and lots of teeny blond curls. Jack smiled at her, but her pale face stayed very serious.

Annie curtsied again, and Jack gave a second bow. As he bowed, he remembered that it was bad manners to rise or look up before Her Imperial Majesty told him to.

Jack stared at the shiny buckles on his shoes, waiting to hear Her Imperial Majesty say “rise.”

Maybe I’m not bowing low enough, Jack thought. He bent over a few inches more. To his horror, the silver flute slipped out of his coat pocket! It clattered to the floor. As Jack grabbed it, his hat fell off.

The imperial children snickered.

Clutching the flute, Jack reached for his hat with his other hand. But when he grabbed his hat, his wig fell off! Jack reached for his wig, but powder got in his nose, and he sneezed. As he sneezed, he slipped on the polished floor and fell to his knees. Gripping his wig, his hat, and his flute, Jack scrambled back up to his bowing position. But he still hadn’t heard Her Imperial Majesty tell him to rise!

The imperial children laughed loudly. Jack even heard Her Imperial Majesty laughing! She probably can’t speak because she’s laughing so hard, thought Jack. He didn’t know what to do. His face was burning hot. You’ve got to get out of here! he told himself.

Still bowing, Jack began backing up with little steps—until he bumped into a wall.



As the imperial children howled with laughter, Jack turned his head and saw Annie peeking out from a doorway, giggling. He backed over to her.

Annie grabbed his coattails and pulled him out of the Great Rosa Room.

The imperial children clapped and cheered. Jack heard one of the girls say between gulps of laughter, “Who was that fool?”

“That was Jack of Frog Creek!” answered the small boy in his high voice. And they all laughed loudly again.



4. Jack of Frog Creek!

Annie was laughing so hard that she could barely stand up. “What—what happened to you in there?” she said. “After I curtsied, I left. When I looked back in the room, you were still bowing!”

“She didn’t say ‘rise’!” said Jack.

“Yes, she did, dummy!” said Annie.

“Well, I didn’t hear her!” said Jack. He turned away from Annie and started walking as fast as he could. He strode through one elegant room into another. He didn’t know where he was. These rooms all look the same, he thought angrily, with stupid velvet furniture and stupid gold-trimmed walls.

“Jack, wait!” Annie called. She hurried after him.

Jack kept walking, desperate to get far away from the scene of his disaster. Finally he came to a door that led outside. He opened it and stepped out onto a long marble terrace overlooking the back of the palace. Bright silvery light from a full moon shone on a huge garden.

Jack stood in the chilly air, trying to calm down. He took a deep breath. He desperately wanted to run back to the tree house and go home.

“Jack!” Annie slipped out to join him. “I’m sorry I called you a dummy,” she said. “Are you okay?”

“I didn’t hear her say to rise,” said Jack. “And the flute fell out of my coat and my hat came off … and my wig … and I sneezed and I slipped…. Come on, let’s leave. We can go down these stairs.”

“No, we can’t leave now,” said Annie. “ We have a mission from Merlin. Don’t feel bad. Hardly anyone saw what you did.”

“Yeah, except Her Imperial Majesty and all those imperial kids,” said Jack. “They all laughed at me.”

“They weren’t being mean,” said Annie. “You were funny. Here, give me your wig.”

Jack handed Annie his wig, and she put it back on his head and straightened it.

“Your hat,” she said.

Jack gave her his hat, and she placed it over his wig. “Hide the flute,” said Annie.

Jack stuck the silver flute back into his pocket. “I don’t know what we need this flute for,” he said. “There’s nothing dangerous here. I don’t get this whole mission.”

“We’ll figure it out. Let’s just go back in,” said Annie. She pulled Jack back inside the palace.

“So what do we do now?” asked Jack.

“We should find the party we were invited to,” said Annie. “That must be what Merlin wanted us to do.” She pointed across the room. People were streaming through a set of doors into another room. Loud party noises came from inside: the chatter of guests, tinkling china, and harp and violin music.

Jack pulled back. But Annie took him by the arm. “Don’t worry, I’ll bet there are hundreds of people in there,” she said. “We’ll get lost in the crowd.”

“But what about all those kids and Her Imperial Majesty?” Jack asked.

“They don’t care about us,” said Annie. “They have too many other guests to think about. Come on.” Annie led Jack through the double doors into the party room.

“Whoa,” breathed Jack. He and Annie stopped and stared.

The party room was the size of a football field. Grand paintings covered the towering ceiling. Everything was trimmed in gold. The glossy white walls and tall mirrors reflected the glow of at least a thousand candles.

Musicians played harps and violins while hundreds of guests stood around long dinner tables, chatting and laughing. Women fanned themselves, their diamonds and rubies flashing in the candlelight. The air smelled of perfume, powder, and roses.

“Okay! Let’s talk about our mission,” said Annie. “ We have to help a brilliant artist get on the right path to bring joy to the world.”

“Yeah, but first we have to find one …,” said Jack.

“Right, so let’s look around,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie started drifting together through the huge room. Jack gazed at the grownups. Dressed in their finery, they all looked pretty much the same. What does a brilliant artist look like? Jack wondered.

“Jack of Frog Creek!” came a high little voice.

Oh, no! thought Jack. He whirled around.

The boy with the tiny sword was grinning up at him. “I have been looking all over for you!” he said.

“Hi!” said Annie. “What’s your name?”

“Wolfie,” said the boy.

“That’s a funny name,” said Annie.

“So is Jack of Frog Creek!” said Wolfie. His eyes shone as he looked up at Jack. “Are you a clown?” he asked.

Annie giggled.

“Yeah, that’s right, I’m a clown,” said Jack.

“How old are you, Wolfie?” said Annie, changing the subject.

“Six!” the little boy said.

“Six?” said Jack. This kid looked more like a four-year-old, he thought, five at the most.

“And I’m eleven,” a girl said.

For the first time, Jack noticed the girl standing behind Wolfie. She wore a white dress with red roses. She was the girl who had helped them in line!

“Hi!” said Annie.

“Hello again,” the girl said in a soft, lovely voice. “I am Wolfie’s sister.”

Jack felt his face grow red. The girl must have seen him make a fool of himself.

“My name is Nannerl,” said the girl.



“Nan-nerl?” said Annie, trying to pronounce her name.

The girl smiled. “You can call me Nan if you like,” she said. “Wolfie and I enjoyed your performance in the Great Rosa Room, Jack. You must be very proud. Her Imperial Majesty does not laugh easily.”

Jack shrugged and scratched his wig. He wondered if the girl was joking. But she looked serious, so he decided not to tell her he hadn’t meant to be funny.

“Do you call your mother ‘Her Imperial Majesty’?” Annie asked Nan.

Nan looked confused. “No.”

“ We call her Mama!” said Wolfie.

“But you just said Her Imperial Majesty doesn’t laugh much,” said Annie.

“Oh, Her Imperial Majesty is not our mother!” Nan said. “Our mother is back home in Salzburg. We are just visiting the palace.”

“Then why was Wolfie sitting on Her Imperial Majesty’s lap?” asked Annie.

“Because she likes me very much!” Wolfie piped up.

Oh, brother, thought Jack.

“Wolfie, be modest,” said Nan, shaking her head. “Actually, Wolfie jumped in her lap when we presented ourselves. I tried to grab him, but Her Imperial Majesty wanted him to stay with her.”

“Were all those other kids imperial children?” Annie asked.

“Oh, yes,” said Nan. “Papa taught me all their names before we came here: Leopold, Ferdinand, Maximilian, Joseph, Maria Antonia, Maria Caroline, Maria Josepha, Maria Amalie, Maria Elisabeth, Maria Christina, Maria Johanna, and Maria Anna.”

“Hmm,” said Jack. “Maria’s a popular name around here.”

Nan laughed. Jack liked making her laugh.

“Hey, look at me!” said Wolfie. He pulled off his wig. He pretended to sneeze and then fell to the floor. “I’m Jack the Clown!” he said.

“Ha-ha. Very funny,” said Jack, forcing a smile. He’d had just about enough of Wolfie.

“Nan, we have a question for you,” said Annie. “Do you know if there are any brilliant artists here at the party?”

“I haven’t really been in Vienna long enough to meet many people,” said Nan. “But Papa told me that artists do live—”

“Wait!” Wolfie broke in. He jumped to his feet. “I know someone here who is very brilliant.”

“Who?” asked Annie.

“Me!” said Wolfie. And he bowed.

“Wolfie,” said Nan, shaking her head.

“Right,” said Jack. He turned back to Nan. “What were you about to say?”

But Wolfie broke in again. “Nan and I are both brilliant!” he exclaimed in his high voice. “Our papa teaches us math, history, writing, reading, geography, music, drawing, riding, fencing, and dancing.” Wolfie raised his arms over his head and did a little dance step.

Annie laughed.

“Wolfie, stop!” said Nan.

Yeah, cool it, kid, thought Jack.

“Do you want to go outside and play in the garden?” Wolfie asked Jack and Annie. “ We can all dance!”

“I don’t think so, Wolfie,” said Jack. “But thanks.” He turned back to Nan. “So! What were you going to tell us about artists?”

“Oh, yes,” said Nan. “Papa told me that Her Imperial Majesty often invites artists to live in the palace and work here.”

“Perfect!” said Jack.

“Do you think any of them are here at the party now?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Nan. “The palace is very big. Papa told us that more than fifteen hundred people live here. Why are you looking for brilliant artists?”

“Oh,” said Annie, “we’re on a mission to—”

Jack interrupted her. “… to party with brilliant artists,” he finished. “That’s our mission.” Then he laughed because he knew he sounded stupid.

Nan laughed, too. “I see,” she said. “All right then, at dinner I will ask Papa where the artists stay.”

“Thank you!” said Jack. Finally, he thought, they were starting their Merlin mission!


5. Bad Manners


A servant rang a bell. Other servants began carrying in large silver bowls, platters, and trays.

“It is time for dinner now,” said Nan. “ We must go, Wolfie. We have to find Papa.” She helped her little brother put his wig back on.

“But I want to stay with Jack and Annie,” whined Wolfie. “I want to play with them in the garden.”

“Not now,” said Nan. She grabbed Wolfie’s hand. “It was nice to talk to you,” she said to Jack and Annie. “And I hope we can see you perform again someday, Jack.”

Jack forced a smile. “Uh … yeah, thanks. Hey, let us know what your dad—I mean, your papa— says about the brilliant artists living in the palace,” he said. “Maybe you can meet us later by those double doors?”

“Yes, after dinner, we will meet you,” said Nan.

“And then we will play in the garden!” said Wolfie.

“No, you and I will have other things to do, Wolfie, remember?” said Nan. “Come along now.” She pulled her little brother away.

“But I want to play with Jack the Clown!” Wolfie wailed.

Jack and Annie watched Wolfie and Nan disappear into the crowd.

“I am not a clown,” Jack said darkly.

“Don’t worry about him,” said Annie. “He really admires you.”

“Lucky me,” said Jack.

The bell sounded again. People started moving toward the dinner tables.

“Where should we sit?” said Annie.

“Anywhere,” said Jack, “as long as we’re out of the way.” He still wanted to hide from the imperial children. “What about that table at the end of the room? Near the door?”

“Sure.”

Jack led the way to the table at the far end of the room. “Let’s grab seats while we can,” he said to Annie.

As grown-ups hovered near the table talking and laughing, Jack and Annie sat down in two chairs. Steaming platters of food lined the middle of the table: beef stew, mashed potatoes, sausages, dumplings, cabbage, spiced apples, and gingerbread.

Jack’s mouth watered. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was. “Okay, here’s our plan,” he said to Annie. “We’ll eat first. Then Nan will tell us where all the artists live, and we’ll get to work.”

“Excuse me, young man and young lady,” someone said in a snippy tone.

Jack and Annie turned around in their chairs. An elderly couple stood glaring at them.

“The empress herself designed the seating plan,” the man said. “And I can assure you these are not your seats.”

“Furthermore,” said the woman, “no one sits until Her Imperial Majesty is seated.”

Jack and Annie jumped up from their chairs.

“Oops!” said Annie.

“Sorry!” said Jack.

“Our mistake,” said Annie. “Excuse us.”

Jack and Annie walked away from the table. “That was bad manners,” Annie said to Jack.

“Who, us or them?” said Jack.

“Us,” Annie said. “I wonder where our seats are.”

“I have a feeling we’re not a part of the empress’s seating plan,” said Jack. His face felt hot again. His wig itched like crazy.

Suddenly a hush fell over the room. The harp and violin music stopped. Everyone stopped talking.

Her Imperial Majesty had entered through the main doors. The imperial children followed her. Her Majesty led them to the table in the middle of the room. Everyone else stood silently, waiting for the imperial family to sit down.

“ We have to get out of here now,“ Jack whispered to Annie. “Soon we’ll be the only ones left standing.”

“Like musical chairs,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “Forget dinner. Let’s go look for where the artists are staying. We can’t wait for Nan to ask her dad.”

As all the guests sat down, Jack and Annie hurried toward the door.

“Jack the Clown!” came a high voice.

Jack looked over his shoulder. Wolfie was waving from one of the tables.

Annie waved back.

“Don’t wave! Keep going,” said Jack. He grabbed Annie’s hand and pulled her out of the party room. They hurried into yet another elegant room with red velvet furniture and gold-trimmed walls.

“Keep going,” said Jack. He led the way into another fancy room.

“Jack and Annie, wait!” came a cry.

“I hear Wolfie!” said Annie.

“Darn!” Jack quickly closed the door behind them. “Keep moving!” he said.

“ We can’t,” said Annie. “That’s mean. We should wait for him.”

“But he’ll slow down our mission!” said Jack. “When are we going to get started?”

“Calm down,” said Annie. “We’ll just tell him we can’t hang out with him now because we have something important that we have to do.”

Jack heaved a sigh. “Okay.”

“Jack! Annie!”

Jack opened the door.

Wolfie ran right into him. “There you are!” the little boy said, smiling. “I was looking for you!”

“No kidding,” said Jack.

“Yes!” Wolfie said. “Are you leaving?”

“Not yet, we have to do something important,” said Jack. “And you can’t come with us.”

Wolfie’s smile vanished.

“Sorry,” said Jack.

“But I want you to come to the garden with me,” said Wolfie.

“Not now,” said Jack. “Wolfie, listen to me. Listen carefully. Annie and I have to do something really, really important. And we have to do it all by ourselves.”

Wolfie’s bottom lip started to quiver. Oh, no, thought Jack. He’s going to cry.

A tear ran down the little boy’s cheek.

“Aww, Wolfie, don’t cry,” Annie said gently.

“Wolfie! Wolfie!” someone called. Nan burst into the room. “Wolfie, what are you doing? Papa is very upset!”

“I want to play with Jack and Annie,” said Wolfie. Another big tear ran down his cheek.

“Please, Wolfie,” Nan begged. “You know you have a big responsibility tonight. You have to—”

“No!” wailed Wolfie, stamping his foot. “No, no, no! I never get to play!”

“Wolfie, stop!” said Nan. “Please do not be this way. Not now, of all times! You will kill Papa!”



“Wolfie! Wolfie!” came a deep voice.

“He’s in here, Papa!” Nan called. “Come, Wolfie.” She took Wolfie’s hand, but he pulled away from her.

“No! I want to play!” shouted Wolfie. And he charged out of the room.

“Wolfie?” A portly man in a wig burst through another door. “Where is he? Where is my son?”

“Oh, Papa!” said Nan. “Wolfie ran away!”

“Ran away?” The man threw his hands in the air. “ We must find him!” he cried.

“Papa, calm down!” said Nan.

“ We will fail utterly without him!” cried her papa. And he rushed out of the room.

“Papa! Papa!” yelled Nan. And she hurried after her father.


6. Under the Moon


“Good grief,” breathed Jack. “That family has problems.”

“Maybe we should help them,” said Annie.

“No, we can’t,” said Jack. “Right now we have our own problem. We have to start working on our mission. Darn! I should have asked Nan’s dad about the artists in the palace.”

“I think he’s too upset to think about that now,” said Annie.

“You’re right,” said Jack. “So we need to find some friendly people who work here and ask them.”

“Let’s go look for help,” said Annie.

As Jack and Annie started toward the door, Nan rushed into the room again. “Has Wolfie come back?” she asked frantically.

“I’m afraid not,” said Annie.

“Oh, dear! Papa will die if Wolfie doesn’t return soon!” said Nan, near tears. “Can you help me find him, please?”

“Well, we’d really like to,” said Jack, “but—”

“Please!” said Nan again. “Please?”

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “Sure.”

“Thank you!” said Nan. “The palace is very large. I’ll go this way, and you go that way. Surely one of us will find him!” She hurried out of the room.

“I’ll bet I know where Wolfie is,” said Annie. “The garden. Remember he kept talking about the garden?”

“Oh, yeah. I think the garden is below that terrace where I went after everyone laughed at me,” said Jack. “Let’s go check.”

Jack led Annie back through one of the elegant palace rooms and into the party room. Everyone was still seated, eating dinner and talking loudly. No one noticed as Jack and Annie hurried through the double doors and slipped into the room off the terrace.

Jack opened the door, and he and Annie stepped outside. The air was chilly, but it felt good. Jack pulled off his hat and his wig. He gave his head a good scratch.

Annie looked down at the moonlit garden. “Do you think that’s the garden Wolfie was talking about?” she said.

The silver light of the full moon shone on a large square with flower beds and fountains. Woods bordered the square. Cricket sounds filled the night.

“Probably,” said Jack. “Wolfie!”

There was no answer.

“Let’s go down and look for him,” said Annie.

Leaving his wig and hat behind, Jack followed Annie down the stone stairway. As they started across the square, a strange sound came from the woods: AI-YEE!

“What was that?” said Jack.

Two creatures scampered out from the trees.

“Ahh!” said Jack.

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “It’s just a squirrel and a cat.”

The squirrel dashed over the flower beds and disappeared. The cat ran after it.

“Yeah, but what was that noise from the woods?” said Jack. “I’ve never heard a squirrel or a cat make a sound like that.”

Another sound came from behind the trees: WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP!

“What was that?” Jack said.

“An owl maybe?” said Annie.

“I’ve never heard an owl make a noise like that!” said Jack. “Have you?”

KER-LOO! KER-LOO!

“Yikes! What was that?” said Annie.

“I don’t know. Those woods sound like a jungle,” said Jack.

“Wolfie!” yelled Annie.

There was no answer. Wind shook the treetops. The cricket chirps grew louder.

“This place feels really weird. Let’s go back inside,” said Jack. “I don’t think Wolfie’s out here.”

“Wait a minute,” said Annie. “I think I just heard him.”

Jack and Annie both listened. A faint little cry came from the woods. “Annie! Jack!”

“Wolfie is out there!” said Annie. “Wolfie!” She picked up her hoopskirt. She hurried across the square and disappeared down a path that led into the woods.

“Annie, wait!” Jack called. He started after her, but then— WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP!

Jack froze. He was sure the whooping sound wasn’t coming from an owl.

EEE-EEE!

Was that Annie screaming? Jack wondered. “Annie?” he yelled. He dashed across the moonlit garden and ran down the path to the woods. He stopped between the trees. “Annie?” he called’ again.

EEE-EEE! Something leapt down from a tree branch and landed on the path. “Ahhh!” said Jack, jumping back. It looked like a baboon! EEE-EEE! The baboon bounded away!

KER-LOO! KER-LOO! Jack looked up. Overhead a huge crane glided through the air. KER-LOO! KER-LOO!

AI-YEE! A crowned peacock stood in the moonlight, fanning its green and gold tail feathers.

What’s going on? Jack thought. This is crazy!

AI-YEE! the peacock cried again.

Jack heard a rustling in the bushes. Something was moving through the woods, grunting, snorting, and growling. A huge bear lumbered onto the moonlit path! Standing on its hind legs, the bear looked about ten feet tall. It growled.

“Hi?” Jack croaked.

The bear growled again. It stepped toward Jack, raking the air with its huge claws.



Jack began backing away. Then he turned and ran as fast as he could. As he wound his way between the trees, he could hear the bear crashing through the woods behind him.

WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP!

A dog-like animal bounded across Jack’s path. Jack recognized it. It was a laughing hyena—a creature he and Annie had seen on the plains of Africa! What’s going on? Jack wondered again. Where are these animals coming from?

“Jack!” yelled Annie. “Over here!”

Annie was hiding behind a tree. Jack ran over and crouched beside her. He could hear the bear growling and thrashing through the brush.

“A huge bear’s chasing me!” Jack said.

“I know! He was chasing me, too!” said Annie.

“I saw a baboon, a hyena, and a crane!” sputtered Jack. “What’s happening?”

“I don’t know!” whispered Annie. “Look!”

From behind the tree, they watched an ostrich prance through the moonlight. Behind the ostrich, a gazelle stepped softly over the path in the woods, looking from side to side. Then the peacock strutted back into sight, fanning its luminous feathers.

“It’s like a zoo in these woods,” said Jack.

“Oh, wow, that’s it!” said Annie.

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“The zoo! That’s where they’re from!” said Annie. “Remember our coach driver said the palace had a zoo!”

“But zoos have cages!” said Jack. “The animals don’t just roam around free!”

“Jack! Annie!” Wolfie’s voice was close by.

“That’s Wolfie again!” said Annie. “Oh, wow. I’ll bet Wolfie let the animals out of their cages.”

“Help!” Wolfie called.

“Oh, man, that kid’s crazy,” said Jack.

“I know, but we have to help him!” said Annie.

Annie picked up her skirt. She and Jack crept from their hiding place and walked cautiously down the path.

“Jack! Annie! Help me!”

Jack and Annie kept going, stepping in and out of the shadowy moonlight. Suddenly Annie gasped and pointed. Wolfie was sitting in the crook of a tree up ahead.

A large spotted animal was crouched below him.

“A leopard!” whispered Jack.

The leopard looked up at Wolfie and growled.


7. Follow Me


“Stand back!” Wolfie shouted at the leopard. “I have a sword! And I’m not afraid to use it!”

“Oh, brother,” whispered Jack. There was no way Wolfie’s tiny sword could ward off the huge leopard. But if Jack and Annie rushed in to rescue Wolfie, the leopard might leap up and attack him.

Annie nudged Jack’s arm. She pointed at the pocket of his coat. She held up her hands, pretending to play a flute.

Jack had forgotten all about their magic flute! He remembered Teddy’s words: Playing this flute will deliver you from danger.

But what can the flute do? Jack wondered. How can it help us? He reached into his pocket and pulled out the flute anyway.

“You play—just blow over the mouthpiece,” whispered Annie. “I’ll make up a song. Remember, whatever I sing will come true.”

Jack nodded and held up the magic flute. It glistened in the light of the moon. Jack wasn’t sure he was holding it right, but he hoped it wouldn’t matter. He closed his eyes and blew gently across the mouthpiece.

Music streamed from the silver instrument! The pure sound wafted through the air like a feather on the wind. The melody was simple, yet beautiful.

Annie started singing, making up a song:

Leopard, hey, leopard,

Listen to our sound.



The leopard turned its head and looked at Jack and Annie. It pricked up its spotted ears.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Clown? thought Jack. Is that me? He didn’t love Annie’s choice of words, but he didn’t have time to worry about it. The leopard rose to its feet and began walking toward Jack and Annie.

Jack was so scared that he almost turned and ran away. But he didn’t dare. He knew that as soon as he stopped playing the flute, the magic would end.

Annie tugged on Jack’s sleeve, and they started walking slowly down the path, back toward the palace. The leopard padded silently after them as Annie kept singing:

Wolfie, hey, Wolfie,

Jump down, jump down …

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Without a word, Wolfie bravely hopped down from the tree. He followed the leopard, Jack, and Annie. They all walked down the path between the trees. Jack had no idea where they were going. He only knew that he should keep playing, Annie should keep singing, and they should all keep moving.

Jack heard branches breaking. He heard grunting and snorting. The giant bear lumbered out from behind some trees. But Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

Bear, hey, bear,

No need to frown.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The bear followed Jack, Annie, the leopard, and Wolfie down the path. The moonlight grew brighter and brighter. The magic music was making the night as bright as day!

Next the hyena’s laugh rippled through the air. WHOOP-WHOOP! The hyena slunk out from behind a tree trunk.

Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

Hyena, hey, hyena,

We’re glad you’ve been found.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The hyena joined the parade.

More creatures appeared: the gazelle and the ostrich and the peacock. Annie sang to them as Jack played the magic flute:

Hey, gazelle! Hey, ostrich!

Hey, bird with a crown!

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



The animals all joined the parade. Jack heard Wolfie laughing with joy. He looked back and saw the little boy waving his arms as if he were conducting the magic music, a big grin on his face.

Jack kept playing, and Annie kept singing:

All creatures who fly,

Fly after this tune.All creatures who walk,

Walk under the moon.

All creatures who crawl,

Crawl over the ground.

Follow me, follow me,

Follow me and the clown.



Baboons and bunnies, snakes and squirrels, lizards and foxes—all the ordinary and extraordinary creatures in the woods followed Jack and Annie. On the other side of the wide square, candles twinkled in the rear windows of the palace. Jack wondered where he should lead all the wild creatures. Where was the zoo? How could he and Annie get the animals back into their cages?

But Annie had another idea, as she sang:

To your forests and plains,

Where you’re all free to roam,

To your lands near and far,

Go home now, go home …

Go home now, go home …

Go home now, go home …





As Annie sang the last words over and over, the creatures began to vanish into thin air. The leopard, bear, hyena, ostrich, gazelle, peacock, baboon, and crane all disappeared. Soon, the only animals left in the woods were the ones that belonged there.

Annie stopped singing, Jack stopped playing, and Wolfie stopped waving his hands. The bright light faded to silver moonlight, and the cats, squirrels, and bunnies scampered off into the dark. The garden became quiet and peaceful again, except for the chirping of crickets.

“Where did the wild animals go?” asked Wolfie.

“Home,” Annie said simply.

Jack put the flute back in his pocket and heaved a sigh. “Good work,” he said to Annie. “But did you have to keep calling me a clown?”

Annie giggled. “Sorry, but ‘clown’ sounds good with so many other words.”

“I’m glad they went home,” said Wolfie. “I wanted them to be free.”

“Listen, Wolfie,” said Jack. “Don’t ever, ever again try to free animals from a zoo. Someone could have gotten hurt!”

“I’m sorry,” said Wolfie. “I promise I’ll never do it again. But how did you make them follow you?”

“It wasn’t us,” said Annie. “It was our music.”

“Was it magic?” asked Wolfie.

“Yes, as a matter of fact it was,” said Annie.

“Music is magic,” said Wolfie thoughtfully. “I love music.”

“Cool,” said Jack.

“I really love it!” said Wolfie.

“Uh … good,” said Jack.

“I love it more than anything!” said Wolfie. He whirled around, clapping his hands and dancing for joy.

What a weird kid, thought Jack.

As Wolfie twirled, the palace clock sounded: bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.

“Seven,” said Annie. “Seven o’clock.”

Wolfie stopped twirling and stumbled dizzily. “Oh, no! I must go!” he cried. “I will be late!” Wolfie grabbed Jack and Annie. “Come with me! You have to come with me!”

“Uh, okay,” said Jack. Why is Wolfie so frantic? he wondered.

Wolfie pulled Jack and Annie toward the palace. “Hurry! I cannot be late!” he cried.

“Late for what?” said Jack.

Before Wolfie could answer, someone called his name. “Wolfie! Where are you?” It was Nan. She was standing on the back terrace of the palace. “Wolfie!” she called again.

“Coming!” shouted Wolfie. “Poor Nan! She is waiting for me! Papa is waiting for me! The whole world is waiting for me!”


8. The Hall of Mirrors


Wolfie took off running toward the palace.

“The whole world?” Jack said to Annie. “I don’t think so.”

Annie smiled. “Come on, let’s go back inside,” she said.

Jack and Annie hurried through the moonlit garden back to the summer palace. They followed Wolfie up the stairway that led to the terrace.

“I’m here, Nan!” Wolfie called.

Nan ran across the terrace and grabbed him. “Oh, Wolfie! Where were you?” she asked.

“I was in the garden! Oh, Nan, the most amazing thing—” said Wolfie.

“Not now, Wolfie, we don’t have time,” Nan said. She brushed off his jacket and straightened his wig.

“I love music, Nan! Jack and Annie made me love music again!” Wolfie said, pointing at Jack and Annie.

“I’m glad, good, come now,” said Nan. “ We have to hurry to the Hall of Mirrors! Papa’s there waiting for us!” Nan pulled Wolfie toward the door.

“Jack, Annie, come with us!” Wolfie yelled over his shoulder.

“In a minute! We’ll be right there!” said Annie.

As Wolfie and Nan went inside, Annie tried to smooth her clothes. The lace on her petticoat was ripped. The bottom of her dress was dirty. Her bows had come untied. The hoop of her skirt was bent. “I’m a mess,” she said to Jack.

“Me too,” he said. His jacket was dirty and his pants were torn. He found his wig and hat where he’d left them and scrunched them back onto his head. “But we have to look for the artists now,” he said.

“What about Wolfie?” said Annie.

“Forget it. We don’t have time to hang out with Wolfie,” said Jack.

“But we told him we’d come,” said Annie.

“ We can’t spend our whole lives chasing after Wolfie!” said Jack. “Because of him, we’ve already used up our only chance to make magic. And we haven’t even started our mission yet!”

“Okay, okay,” said Annie. “But we should at least say good-bye to him and Nan.”

Jack sighed. “Okay. A quick good-bye,” he said.

Jack and Annie walked across the terrace and stepped into the palace.

“Excuse me,” Annie said to a servant, “where is the Hall of Mirrors?”

The servant frowned at their appearance. But he pointed to a door on the right. “Pass through the next three rooms, then through the Great Rosa Room, into the Hall of Mirrors.”

“Thanks!” Jack and Annie hurried through the four rooms until they came to a large door. They opened it and peeked into the Hall of Mirrors.

Mirrors hung on the walls. The room was filled with party guests sitting in rows of chairs. Her Imperial Majesty and the imperial children sat in the front row. Wolfie was standing near the front of the room with Nan and their father.

Jack wanted to leave as quickly as possible. But Wolfie saw them and called out, “Jack! Annie! Come in!”

Jack started to slip away. But Annie pushed the door open and stepped inside. Oh, brother, thought Jack, following her.

“Watch me!” cried Wolfie. Then Wolfie shot away from his family and hopped in front of the crowd.

Oh, no! thought Jack. What’s he doing? Why doesn’t someone grab him?

Wolfie faced the audience. He placed his hand over his heart and bowed. Then he swept back his coattails and climbed up on a bench in front of an odd-looking piano. His short legs didn’t even reach the floor.

Wolfie closed his eyes and bowed his head close to the keyboard. With just one finger he began tapping out some musical notes.

Why’s everyone watching this little kid pretend to play the piano? Jack wondered. Then he realized something amazing: the simple tune Wolfie was picking out on the keyboard was the same tune the magic flute had played in the garden.

Everyone in the room seemed to hold their breath as Wolfie played. He went from tapping with one finger to tapping with two fingers and then three. As Wolfie kept tapping out notes, he didn’t look like a silly six-year-old anymore. The expression on his face was thoughtful and dreamy.

Suddenly Wolfie was playing with all his fingers. His small hands flew over the black and white keys as he added to the tune of the magic flute.

Jack was stunned. He couldn’t believe a little kid could make such beautiful music. The sounds from the piano were sometimes light and playful,and at other times heavy and forceful. The slow parts of Wolfie’s music made Jack want to close his eyes. The lively parts made him want to bounce up and down.



Wolfie ended his concert with a great flourish. Then he stood up and bowed.

The guests jumped to their feet, smiling and laughing, clapping and yelling, “Bravo! Bravo!”

Wolfie kept bowing. The clapping and cheering would die down, but then it would start up again. As long as people clapped, Wolfie bowed.

Finally Wolfie’s father stepped up to the piano. Then Wolfie seemed to turn into a little kid again. “Papa!” he said. He grabbed his father and buried his face in his father’s coat. Wolfie’s dad had tears on his cheeks as he hugged his son.

All the guests talked excitedly about the performance they’d just seen:

“I couldn’t believe my ears!”

“I couldn’t believe my eyes!”

“How did he do it? He is so young and small!”

As the party guests kept praising Wolfie, Nan walked over to Jack and Annie. “Thank you for bringing Wolfie back for his concert,” she said.

“Has he been playing a long time?” Annie asked.

“Papa has been teaching him since he was three,” said Nan. “And now Wolfie is even starting to write his own music. He tells Papa he hears tunes in his head—like the tune he played tonight. I have never heard that one before.”

Annie smiled at Jack, and he smiled back at her. “Cool,” Annie said.

A hush fell over the crowd. Her Imperial Majesty had stepped forward. She took Wolfie’s hands in hers. “Thank you for your brilliant performance, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,” she said.

As the crowd clapped wildly again, Annie looked at Jack. “Mozart!” she said.

Jack was confused. Mozart? He knew the name Mozart. Their piano teacher loved the music of Mozart. Their parents loved it, too. In fact, they’d once taken Annie and Jack to hear a concert of Mozart’s music. Jack couldn’t believe that this strange little kid was the world-famous Mozart.

The applause stopped as Her Imperial Majesty spoke to the crowd. “ We have witnessed a great event here tonight. I know we will all remember it in the years to come, when our young Wolfgang Mozart brings joy to all the world with his music.”

“Oh, man,” Jack whispered. He looked at Annie. “Did you hear that?”

Annie smiled at him and nodded.

“Thank you again for your help,” Nan said to them. She started to leave, then turned back. “Oh, I asked Papa your question about the artists living here. He said he was talking about another palace in Vienna. I am sorry.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “No problem.”

As Nan headed for Wolfie and her father, Annie looked at Jack. “ We found our great artist,” she said. “He was with us all along.”


9. Me and the Clown


“Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” Jack sighed. “And right now he’s just a little kid.”

“So I guess we did our mission,” said Annie. “Remember what Wolfie said to Nan? He said we made him love music again. So I guess we put him back on the path to giving his gifts to the world.”

“Yep, and now we can leave,” said Jack. “Whew.” He was ready to get out of his fancy clothes and wig and go home and have a good dinner.

“Let’s go say good-bye to Wolfie,” said Annie.

As Jack and Annie started toward Wolfie, Her Imperial Majesty was laughing at something he had said. “You are truly a young magician, my little Wolfgang Mozart!” she said.

“No, not me,” said Wolfie. “Jack and Annie are the true magicians!”

“Who?” said Her Imperial Majesty.

“Over there,” said Wolfie, pointing across the room. “Jack! Annie!” he called.

All eyes turned to Jack and Annie.

“Look! It’s Jack of Frog Creek!” said one of the imperial children.

Jack froze, horrified.

“Jack is a clown,” said Wolfie. “And he plays magic music on his flute. And Annie sings beautiful magic songs. I just heard them.”

“Really?” said Her Imperial Majesty. She raised her eyebrows. “Well, Jack and Annie. Perhaps you will perform for all of us here as well?”

Everyone was silent, waiting for an answer from Jack and Annie.

“Um, well, you see …,” Jack began.

“Sure,” said Annie with a big smile. “We’d love to perform for you.”

Oh, no! thought Jack.

“Yes! Sing for us! Play for us!” said Wolfie, clapping his hands. He ran to Jack and Annie and pulled them toward the front of the room.

Annie leaned close to Jack. “You play; I’ll sing,” she whispered.

“But the flute won’t make magic anymore,” Jack said out of the corner of his mouth.

“Do the best you can,” whispered Annie. She smiled at the crowd.

Jack could hardly breathe. This is worse than facing the leopard and bear! he thought.

“Me, then you,” Annie said to him.

Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the silver flute. Annie started singing:

We came in a coach,

In a wig and a gown.We came to Vienna,

Me and the clown.

Annie turned to Jack. As everyone watched him, he held the instrument in a playing position. He desperately hoped a little magic still lingered in the flute. He blew air over the mouthpiece.

No sound came out. All anyone could hear was Jack’s huffing and puffing.

Wolfie giggled. “See! Jack’s a clown!” he said.

Everyone laughed.

Okay, thought Jack, if they want a clown, I’ll be a clown. Jack put on a goofy face. He looked into the end of the flute, as if searching for its missing sound. He jerked back his head, as if something had shot out of the flute and hit him in the eye.

Everyone laughed harder.

Jack liked hearing their laughter this time. He made a big show of wiping his eye. Then he gave Annie a silly grin.

Annie shook her head and sang:

My brother’s a fool,

He’s always around.

Why is it always

Me and the clown?



Jack pretended to bonk her on the head with his flute. He tried playing again, but again no sound came out. He turned the flute upside down and shook it, as if he were trying to shake out some music.

Annie rolled her eyes, to show she thought Jack was hopeless. Then she nodded at him, motioning for him to walk with her. As they moved away from the front of the room, Annie sang the last verse of her song:

It’s time to go,

It’s time to leave town.

Good-bye from me, and

Good-bye from the clown.

Crossing the room, Jack put the flute to his lips again. As he followed Annie to the door, he looked at the crowd and winked. Then he started to make up his own flute sounds. “Tweetle-tweetletweetle!” he sang. “Toot-toot-ah-roo!”

The audience laughed. When Jack saw Nan laughing hard, it spurred him on, and he did a little dance step. “Peep-peep-peep-ah-lee!” he sang, pretending to play the flute. “Peek-peek-a-boo!”



At the door, Jack and Annie stopped. Jack held the flute to his side and bowed. Annie curtsied at the same time. The audience laughed and clapped. Together Jack and Annie waved to the crowd.

“Bye, Wolfie!” shouted Annie. She blew kisses to him. “Keep making music!”

“Have a great life, Wolfie!” shouted Jack.

“Bye, Jack! Bye, Annie!” yelled Wolfie. “I promise I will never forget you!”

Jack bowed very low, and Annie curtsied again.

“Rise,” said Her Imperial Majesty, laughing.

Jack and Annie straightened up, waved one last time, and slipped out the door.



10. Joy

“Go, go!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran through the Great Rosa Room, through the next three rooms, and into the room off the back terrace. Then they turned and hurried to the huge party room, where the thousand candles had nearly burned out. They ran to the door that led out to the front entrance.

“ We have to leave. Good night!” Annie said to the guard. “Thanks for everything!”

The guard opened the door, and they ran outside.

“Keep going!” said Jack.

They hurried down the sweeping, curved stairway that led to the giant square.

A line of coaches was parked below, waiting to pick up guests. Jack and Annie saw Josef standing by his coach. The moonlight shone on his two milk white horses.

“Josef!” shouted Annie.

Jack and Annie ran over to the coachman.

“Ah, my young friends!” he said. “How was your evening?”

“Great,” said Annie. “But we have to go home now. Do you have time to take us back to the gate?”

“Indeed, it is early,” said Josef. “I can take you now and then return for my employer and his family.”

Josef gave Annie his hand and helped her into the coach. Then he helped Jack. Josef climbed up onto his bench and snapped the reins, and the two horses clomped over the cobblestones.

“So tell me now, young lady,” said Josef, “did you have a good time at the party? What did you see and what did you do?”

“I had a great time!” said Annie. “I was received by Her Imperial Majesty. I saw a room lit with a thousand candles. I made good friends, met some zoo animals, heard a great concert, and saw a silly clown.”

“Excellent,” said Josef. “And you, young man?”

“I did all those things, too,” said Jack. “But the clown was the best part. He knew how to make great use of his wits and his talents.”

Annie laughed. Josef drove the coach through the palace gate and stopped on the cobblestone street. “Where do you need to go?” he asked.

“Oh, this is perfect,” said Annie. “ We can get out right here. Thank you.”

Jack and Annie climbed out of the coach and looked up at Josef.

“Thank you, Josef!” said Annie.

“Yeah, thanks a lot for the ride,” said Jack.

“You two are very mysterious,” said Josef. “You appeared out of the twilight and now you disappear into the moonlight.”

“We’re magicians,” said Annie.

“It would seem so,” said Josef, smiling. He tipped his hat. “Well, I had better return now. Good night, my young friends.”

“Good night, Josef,” said Jack and Annie.

Josef flicked the reins, and the milk white horses clomped back toward the palace gates.

“Nice guy,” said Jack. “Let’s go.”

Jack and Annie ran to the trees that lined the cobblestone street. “There!” said Annie. She grabbed the rope ladder.

Annie started up to the tree house. Jack followed her. When they got inside, they looked out the window at the full moon shining over Vienna, Austria.

“Good-bye, Wolfie,” said Annie.

“Good luck, kid,” said Jack.

Then Jack picked up the envelope from their invitation. He pointed at the words Frog Creek. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Jack opened his eyes. “Ahhh,” he sighed with relief. They were back in the Frog Creek woods. They were wearing their own clothes again. Jack was holding the magic flute.

“Ready?” asked Annie.

“Totally” said Jack.

Jack carefully laid the flute in a corner of the tree house. Then he and Annie climbed down the rope ladder and started for home.

Jack was in such a good mood, he nearly bounced through the woods. The sun was going down, dappling the ground with lovely light. The air was soft and smelled like new leaves. Jack knew a good dinner was waiting for them at home.

When Jack and Annie came out of the woods, they took off running down the street. They crossed their yard, scrambled onto the porch, and banged through the front door.

“We’re back!” Annie called.

“Just in time,” their dad said from the kitchen. “Dinner’s in a few minutes.”

“Quick, before we eat …,” Jack said to Annie. He led her over to the computer. He sat down and typed in one word: Mozart.

There were 48,400,207 entries.

“Whoa!” said Jack. He clicked the first one. He read aloud:

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the most famous child musician in history. He performed all over Europe for many years. As Mozart grew up, he composed more than six hundred pieces of music. For over two hundred years, his music has brought joy to the world.

“ Yes!” said Annie.

As Jack scrolled down, three words leapt out at him. He gasped. “Listen to this!” he said. And then he read to Annie:

Mozart’s last great opera was called The Magic Flute.

Annie smiled at Jack. “Wolfie kept his promise,” she said. “He never forgot us.”


More Facts About Mozart and His Time


Born in Austria in 1756, Mozart was baptized Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. When Mozart was three years old, his father, Leopold, began teaching him to play the organ, the violin, and the harpsichord (an early piano-like instrument). Mozart started to write his first musical compositions when he was only five.

In October 1762, Leopold took Mozart and his sister, Maria Anna (also called Nannerl), to Vienna to play for the Empress Maria Theresa and her court at her summer palace, known as Schönbrunn Palace. According to a letter from his father, during the visit the young Mozart clambered onto the lap of the empress and hugged and kissed her. The only time he did not behave like a small child was when he sat at the harpsichord to play. His genius then stunned everyone in the court.

For the next three years, Mozart and Nannerl toured the capitals of Europe as child wonders. Nannerl was considered to be as talented as her brother. But this changed when she and Mozart grew older and he began performing his own compositions. Today many consider Mozart the best classical composer who ever lived.

The summer palace of Empress Maria Theresa actually had one of the first zoos in the world. It was built in 1752 by her husband, Emperor Franz Stephan, who had a great interest in natural history. The zoo at first housed mostly exotic waterfowl. But over the years, more and more wild animals were brought there from expeditions all over the world. In 1828, the arrival of the first giraffe caused a huge sensation. Today the Schönbrunn Zoo is still a favorite tourist spot in Vienna.

Jack was asleep. He was dreaming that he was sleeping on a boat. It was rocking back and forth, back and forth…

“Jack.”

Jack opened his eyes. It was just getting light outside. Rain was tapping against the window-pane. Tappity-tap-tap. Jack closed his eyes again.

“Jack, get up.”

Jack opened one eye and looked up. Annie stood next to his bed. She was already dressed. She was even wearing her raincoat. “They’re here,” she whispered.

“No, they’re not,” Jack said. He closed his eye.

“Yes, they are,” said Annie. “They’re waiting for us.”

“How do you know?” Jack asked.

“I dreamed it,” said Annie.

“Oh, you dreamed it.” Jack turned over and pulled the covers over his head. “Go back to bed. It’s really early, and it’s raining.”

“Come on, Jack,” said Annie. “I saw them. They were wearing their cloaks and looking out the tree house window.”

“Great,” said Jack. “I just dreamed I was sleeping on a boat.”

“But my dream was real, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack pretended to snore.

“Okay,” said Annie. “I guess you want me to go there all by myself. You want me to have a great adventure while you just lie here, dreaming about sleeping. If that’s really what you want, I’ll leave you alone.”

“Good,” said Jack. “Have fun.”

“Don’t worry, I will,” said Annie, and she left Jack’s room.

Jack lay still for a moment, listening to the rain fall outside. Darn, he thought, what if she’s right?

Jack heaved a sigh. Then he climbed out of bed. He pulled on his clothes and grabbed his backpack. He slipped down the stairs, put on his rain boots and raincoat, then headed out the front door.

Annie was standing on the porch, waiting for him. “Ready?” she said.

Jack just grunted. But as he and Annie took off into the cool, rainy dawn, he woke up completely. As they charged up the sidewalk, Jack’s heart pounded with excitement. By the time they headed into the Frog Creek woods, Jack felt like he’d dreamed Annie’s dream, too.

Raindrops tapped on tree branches. Jack and Annie scrunched over fallen red and gold leaves until they came to the tallest oak. Jack looked up.

“Ta-da!” said Annie.

The tree house was back. And Teddy and Kathleen were dressed in their dark cloaks, looking out the window.



A Good Night for Ghosts

“Good morning!” called Kathleen.

“We dreamed about you!” said Jack. “At least Annie did.”

Teddy and Kathleen smiled, as if this news didn’t surprise them at all.

Annie and Jack started up the rope ladder. When they climbed inside the tree house, they hugged the two young enchanters. “Welcome,” said Kathleen. Her beautiful sea-blue eyes sparkled.

“Do you have a new mission for us?” said Jack.

“Indeed,” said Teddy, smiling. “Just like last time, Merlin wants you to help a creative person bring his gifts to the world.”

“And this will help you,” said Kathleen. She pulled a book from her cloak.

“Great!” said Jack. He took the book from Kathleen. The cover showed a street parade with musicians playing trumpets and trombones. The title was A History of New Orleans Music.

“New Orleans?” said Annie.

“Yes, New Orleans, Louisiana,” said Kathleen.

“You will love this city,” said Teddy.

“Cool,” said Annie.

“And here is your magic flute.” Kathleen picked up a gleaming silver flute from the corner of the tree house. It was the magic flute Jack had played on their adventure in Vienna, Austria. “Only this time…” Kathleen tossed the flute into the air. It hovered for a moment, then began to twirl around and around. There was a flash of blue light—and the flute was gone! Floating in its place was a shining brass instrument.

Kathleen plucked the instrument from the air. “This time you will play a magic trumpet,” she said.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack. “That’s incredible.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “I’ve always wanted to play the trumpet.”

Kathleen laughed. “Well, this is your chance,” she said. “The trumpet’s magic will make you a brilliant performer.”

“But the magic can only happen once,” Teddy reminded Jack and Annie, “just as on your last journey with the magic flute. Play the trumpet only when you face your greatest danger.”

“And while one of us plays, the other has to make up a song, right?” said Annie. “And whatever we sing will come true.”

“Precisely,” said Teddy.

“Um… what danger will we face in New Orleans?” asked Jack.

“Perhaps none,” said Teddy. “But keep the magic trumpet with you just in case. And remember, after you have played it, the magic will be gone and it will become an ordinary trumpet.”

“Got it,” said Jack. He took a deep breath.

“Okay,” said Annie. “Ready?”

“Wait,” said Jack. “Can you tell us what kind of creative genius we’re looking for?”

“We can do more than that,” said Kathleen with a smile. “We can tell you his name. It is Louis Armstrong.”

“Louis Armstrong,” repeated Jack. He knew that name.

“He is the King of Jazz,” said Teddy.

“The King of Jazz?” said Annie. “Cool!”

“Yes,” said Kathleen. “But Louis Armstrong won’t know that when you meet him. It is your job to put him on the right path.”

“To give his gifts to the world,” said Annie. “Got it.”

“Good,” said Teddy. “And now you should go.”

“Right,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there,” he said. “To New Orleans!”

“To meet the King of Jazz!” said Annie.

“Good luck!” said Teddy as he and Kathleen waved good-bye.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Years ago, my husband, Will, and I lived for several weeks in the French Quarter in New Orleans while Will was performing in a play at the Saenger Theatre. During that time we fell in love with the city’s architecture, food, and especially its music. Every night after Will’s show, we sought out our favorite jazz bands. One of our best memories is visiting the New Orleans Jazz Museum and seeing the first cornet played by a young Louis Armstrong, who grew up to be one of the greatest jazz performers the world has ever known. Soon after that stay in New Orleans, we started collecting Louis Armstrong’s early recordings and began learning about his life.

I always knew it was only a matter of time before Jack, Annie, and I would have an adventure in New Orleans with Louis Armstrong. And now I can say it was one of the best adventures we’ve ever had.

For Will, who always wanted

me to write this book





“I was so happy I did not know what to do. I had

hit the big time. I was up North [playing] with the

greats…My boyhood dream had come true at last.”

—Louis Armstrong, from Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie had traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history. After they proved to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he awarded them the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that helped them make their own magic. With the help of the wand, Jack and Annie were able to find four secrets of happiness to help Merlin when he was in trouble.

Now Merlin wants Jack and Annie to bring happiness to others—by helping four creative people give their special gifts to the world…


1. Way Down Yonder in New Orleans


Jack was asleep. He was dreaming that he was sleeping on a boat. It was rocking back and forth, back and forth…

Kathleen plucked the instrument from the air. “This time you will play a magic trumpet,” she said.

“Oh, man,” breathed Jack. “That’s incredible.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “I’ve always wanted to play the trumpet.”

Kathleen laughed. “Well, this is your chance,” she said. “The trumpet’s magic will make you a brilliant performer.”

“But the magic can only happen once,” Teddy reminded Jack and Annie, “just as on your last journey with the magic flute. Play the trumpet only when you face your greatest danger.”

“And while one of us plays, the other has to make up a song, right?” said Annie. “And whatever we sing will come true.”

“Precisely,” said Teddy.

“Um… what danger will we face in New Orleans?” asked Jack.

“Perhaps none,” said Teddy. “But keep the magic trumpet with you just in case. And remember, after you have played it, the magic will be gone and it will become an ordinary trumpet.”

“Got it,” said Jack. He took a deep breath.

“Okay,” said Annie. “Ready?”

“Wait,” said Jack. “Can you tell us what kind of creative genius we’re looking for?”

“We can do more than that,” said Kathleen with a smile. “We can tell you his name. It is Louis Armstrong.”

“Louis Armstrong,” repeated Jack. He knew that name.

“He is the King of Jazz,” said Teddy.

“The King of Jazz?” said Annie. “Cool!”

“Yes,” said Kathleen. “But Louis Armstrong won’t know that when you meet him. It is your job to put him on the right path.”

“To give his gifts to the world,” said Annie. “Got it.”

“Good,” said Teddy. “And now you should go.”

“Right,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book. “I wish we could go there,” he said. “To New Orleans!”

“To meet the King of Jazz!” said Annie.

“Good luck!” said Teddy as he and Kathleen waved good-bye.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. Money Blues


The hot, muggy air was filled with noise. Jack and Annie heard the clippity-clop of horses’ hooves. They heard voices calling out “Crawfish pies!” “Buttermilk!” “Gumbo for sale here!”

Jack looked down at his and Annie’s clothes. They were both wearing white shirts and dark trousers with suspenders. Jack’s backpack had turned into a cloth bag. Neither Jack nor Annie was wearing shoes.

“Wow, we’re barefoot. That’s cool,” said Annie. “And at least I can run in these pants. I like them a lot better than the dress I wore on our last mission.”

“Yeah.” Jack smiled, remembering Annie’s long, frilly dress in Vienna and his velvet coat and white wig. “I like being barefoot, too,” he said. “But what year did we come to? I can’t tell from our outfits.”

Jack and Annie looked out the window. The tree house had landed in a grove of palm trees. Not far away, steamboats churned down a river. Below them was a bustling city scene. Rows of stores lined both sides of a wide street. Vendors were selling food from carts. Women shoppers wore long skirts, and men wore white suits and hats.

Mule carts and horse-drawn buggies bumped alongside a few antique-looking cars. Moving down the middle of the street were red and green train cars. Each one was attached to an electric line overhead.

“This is definitely a long time ago,” said Jack. “But when exactly?”



“I can’t tell,” said Annie.

“Maybe our research book can help us,” said Jack. “I’ll look up Louis Armstrong.” Jack looked in the index of A History of New Orleans Music and found a chapter on Louis Armstrong. He read:

Born in New Orleans in 1901, Louis Armstrong grew up to be one of the greatest jazz musicians who ever lived.

A photo showed an African American man playing a trumpet. His cheeks were puffed out and his eyes were closed. Stage lights were shining on him. Thousands of people were in the audience. The caption under the photo read Louis Armstrong, King of Jazz.

“So what is jazz exactly?” asked Annie.

“It’s a kind of music,” said Jack.

“Well, yeah, but what kind?” said Annie.

Jack looked up jazz in the glossary of their book. He read:

Jazz began in New Orleans in the early 1900s and was first played by African Americans. It is a style of music that has a strong beat and is played with lots of feeling. Jazz melodies are often made up on the spot.

“Got it,” said Annie. “Read more about Louis.”

Jack flipped back to the pages about Louis Armstrong and read:

As a young teenager, Louis Armstrong often performed with “kid bands” on the streets of the city. Eventually he played with older musicians in dance halls and developed his musical talents performing on Mississippi riverboats. When he was twenty-one, he moved to Chicago, where—



“Stop. That’s all we need,” Annie broke in.

“It is?” asked Jack.

“Yep, we’ll just ask someone what the date is,” said Annie. “Then we can figure out how old Louis Armstrong is, and we’ll know where to look for him: the streets, a dance hall, or on the Mississippi River.”

Annie picked up the magic trumpet. She tucked it under her arm and started down the rope ladder.

“I guess that’s a plan,” murmured Jack. “Sort of.” He put the New Orleans book in his bag and followed her.

In their bare feet, Jack and Annie hurried a short distance to the wide, busy street. A sign read CANAL STREET.

The sidewalks on both sides of Canal Street were crowded with vendors pushing carts and shouting in rich, loud voices.

“Buttermilk! Buttermilk! Fresh from the buttermilk man! Bring out your bucket! Bring out your can!” shouted a man.

“Blackberries! Mighty fine! Three sacks for a dime!” called an old woman.

“Read all the news! Chase away the blues!” sang a boy with newspapers.

“Let’s buy a paper,” said Jack. “It’ll tell us the date.”

Jack and Annie ran over to the boy selling newspapers.

“A paper, please,” said Annie.

“A penny, please,” said the boy.

Jack and Annie dug into their pockets.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “No money.”

“Uh-oh,” said the boy. “No paper.” He started to walk away.

“Wait, please,” said Jack. “Can you just tell us the date?”

“October thirty-first, the eve of All Saints’ Day,” said the boy. “You didn’t know that?”

“Uh, not really,” said Jack.

“And what year is it?” Annie asked.

The newsboy scowled. “It’s 1915! Don’t you two know anything? Who are you?”

Before Jack could think of an answer, Annie blurted out, “We’re musicians. We came all the way from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.” She held up their trumpet.

“Oh, right. And it’s a different year in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, than here in New Orleans, Louisiana! I forgot!” The newsboy headed up the street, laughing at his own joke.

“Well, yeah,” said Annie.

Jack laughed. “Okay, Louis Armstrong was born in 1901, so if it’s 1915…”

“He’s fourteen years old,” said Annie. “So that means he’s playing with kid bands in the streets. Excuse me!” she called to the buttermilk man. “Can you tell us where some kid bands might be playing today?”

“Try Jackson Square in the French Quarter,” said the man.

“What’s the French Quarter?” asked Jack.

“It’s the oldest section of the city,” said the buttermilk man. “Catch that streetcar that’s stopping up ahead! It will take you right there.”

“Thanks!” said Annie. She and Jack ran up the sidewalk.

“So I guess those train cars in the street are called streetcars,” said Jack.

“Makes sense!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie ran to a streetcar stop. They stood in line and then climbed aboard. “Oh, wait,” Jack said to Annie. “We can’t! We don’t have money!” He started to leave.

“Hey, sonny, are you coming or going?” said the conductor.

“Sorry. We made a mistake,” said Jack. “We don’t have any money.”

“Don’t worry, there’s no fare today. It’s the eve of All Saints’ Day,” said the conductor.

“Oh! Good,” said Jack. He and Annie chose a wooden seat near the door and sat down.

“Could you tell us when to get out for Jackson Square in the French Quarter?” Annie asked the conductor.

“Sure thing,” the conductor said.

Annie rested their magic trumpet on her lap. “Lucky for us we came here on the eve of All Saints’ Day,” she said to Jack.

“Yeah, but what does that mean?” said Jack. As the streetcar headed along Canal, he looked up All Saints’ Day in their book. He read aloud:

November first is celebrated as All Saints’ Day in New Orleans. It is a day to honor those who have passed away. Sometimes on the eve of All Saints’ Day, people wear costumes and have parties and parades. Considered the spookiest night of the year, the eve of All Saints’ Day is a good time for ghost sightings.

“The eve of All Saints’ Day sounds like Halloween,” said Annie. “It’s the same day, too: October thirty-first.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But what do they mean, ‘a good time for ghost sightings’?” He kept reading:

The city of New Orleans is often called the most haunted city in America. According to legend, the old blacksmith shop on Bourbon Street is haunted by the ghost of the famous pirate Jean Lafitte. Some say that Saint Louis Cathedral is haunted by a Spanish priest, and that a hotel on Chartres Street is haunted by Confederate soldiers. There have been ghost sightings in many other places throughout the city as well.

“Ooh, sounds scary,” said Annie.

“Huh,” said Jack. “Well!” He slammed the book shut. “Forget ghosts. We didn’t come to New Orleans to look for ghosts. We came here to look for Louis Armstrong, the King of Jazz.”



3. Coal Cart Blues

The streetcar turned onto a crowded, busy street. Lively music blared from restaurants and dance halls.

“We’re in the French Quarter now, and you’re the next stop,” the conductor said to Jack and Annie. “Head down St. Peter Street toward the Mississippi River. You’ll run right into Jackson Square.”

“Thanks!” Jack put the research book back in his bag. Annie tucked the trumpet under her arm. When the streetcar came to a stop, they hopped off.



“Good luck playing that horn, missy!” said the conductor.

“Thanks, I’ll need it!” said Annie.

As the streetcar pulled away, Jack and Annie looked around. “Hey, this is Bourbon Street,” said Annie, pointing to a street sign. “Isn’t that the street with the haunted blacksmith shop?”

“Don’t think about that,” said Jack. “Let’s head down St. Peter.”

Jack and Annie left Bourbon Street and started down St. Peter Street. They passed tall, narrow houses painted pale green, yellow, and pink. Vines grew up walls and twined around iron balconies. Alleys led to courtyards with trickling fountains.

“I like the buildings in New Orleans,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and it smells good, too,” said Jack.

Delicious food smells filled the air. From a mule-drawn cart, an old woman cried out, “Waffles! Get your waffles here! Yes sir, fresh, hot waffles!”

Jack was getting hungry. Outside a restaurant was a sign that read:

Special! Dinner 10 cents.

“Gosh, things are cheap in 1915,” said Jack. “Too bad we don’t even have a dime.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “Oh, look!” She pointed to a grand cathedral with soaring spires. “A cathedral! That must be the place with the ghost of the Spanish priest.”

“Why do you like ghosts so much?” said Jack.

“I don’t like ghosts so much,” said Annie.

“Well, you keep talking about them,” said Jack.

“I’m just pointing things out,” said Annie. “You’re the one who brought up ghosts in the first place.”

“Well, let’s forget them,” said Jack. He didn’t like ghosts. He didn’t even like thinking about them.

Soon Jack and Annie came to a huge green park with an iron fence around it. A sign at the entrance read: JACKSON SQUARE.

“We found it!” said Jack.

Outside the iron fence, in the hot afternoon sunlight, small bands of barefoot kids were playing music. Some strummed banjos. Others played harmonicas or long tin horns. Three boys sang in harmony. A couple of the smallest kids passed around hats, collecting money for the different bands.

“Where’s Louis Armstrong?” Annie asked Jack. “No one here looks like the picture in our book.”

“Of course not,” said Jack. “The picture shows him as a grown-up. He wouldn’t look the same when he’s fourteen.”

“I’ll ask,” said Annie. She went up to a small girl passing a hat. “Excuse me, is there a musician here named Louis Armstrong?”

“Louis Armstrong? You mean Dipper?” asked the girl.

“I guess…,” said Annie.

“Hey, Little Mack!” the girl shouted to the biggest kid in the singing trio. “Where’s Dipper Armstrong?”

“Just saw him—he’s at the River Café!” shouted Little Mack.

“Where’s that?” Annie asked.

“Down by the river,” said the small girl. She pointed beyond the square. “Walk down Decatur Street and you’ll see it.” The girl held up the hat, as if asking for a donation.

“Sorry, no money,” said Jack.

“But thanks for your help,” said Annie. She and Jack left the square. They hurried along Decatur Street.

“So Dipper must be a nickname for Louis Armstrong,” said Jack.

“Yeah,” said Annie. “And Dipper must be playing music at the café.”

“There it is,” said Jack. He pointed to a red sign on a slanted rooftop.



“Doughnuts, yum,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie walked under a striped red awning. Waiters in white jackets were running around with trays of coffee and delicious-smelling doughnuts. Jack’s mouth watered.

“That’s funny. There’s no music here,” said Annie. “Excuse us,” she called to one of the waiters. “Have you seen Louis Armstrong? Or Dip—”

“Did you come here to buy something, kids?” the waiter interrupted rudely.

“No, we don’t have any money—” started Jack.

“Then out, boy!” the waiter shouted. “No begging in here!”

“He’s not begging!” said Annie. “We’re looking for—”

“I know beggars when I see them! Out!” said the waiter.

“Let’s go. I don’t think Dipper’s in here, anyway,” said Jack.

“Wait a minute, I have to tell them that we’re not beggars!” Annie said.

“It’s not worth it, come on,” said Jack.

Jack was mad, too, but he pulled Annie out from under the awning. “I think it’s the way we look,” he said. “Our clothes make us look poor. And we don’t have shoes on.”

“It’s not fair,” said Annie.

“Forget it. We’ll ask someone else where to find Dipper,” said Jack.

On the street by the café was a mule cart filled with coal. A young teenager was putting a bucket and shovel into the back of the cart. He was barefoot and wore clothes like Jack and Annie’s.

“Excuse me!” Jack called. “Do you know Louis Armstrong? Or Dipper?”

The boy turned. When he saw Jack and Annie, he grinned. He had the friendliest smile Jack had ever seen. “Louis Armstrong?” he said. “That’s me. How can I help you, man?”

Jack was at a loss for words. He hadn’t thought about what to say to Louis Armstrong when they found him.

“Hi, Dipper!” said Annie, walking up to the boy. “We’re Jack and Annie from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania. Friends of ours told us to find you when we came to New Orleans.”

“What friends?” asked Dipper.

“Teddy and Kathleen,” said Annie.

The boy looked puzzled. But then his gaze fell on Annie’s trumpet. “Hey, nice horn. Can you play that thing?”

“Only when the time is right,” said Annie.

“And when’s that?” asked Dipper.

“I won’t know till I feel it,” said Annie.

Dipper smiled his radiant smile again. “Ha! I know just what you mean!” he said. He wiped his hand on his pants and held it out to shake. “Any friends of Teddy and Kathleen’s are friends of mine.”

As Jack shook Dipper’s hand, he sputtered, “You—you know Teddy and Kathleen?”

“No, man, never heard of them,” said Dipper. “But I consider everybody my friend.”

“Oh. Oh!” said Annie. She and Jack laughed.

“Only problem is I can’t hang out with y’all right now,” said Dipper. He climbed onto the mule cart.

“Where—where you going, man?” asked Jack.

“I’m making my rounds with this coal cart,” said Dipper. “And I have lots more work to do today. But be sure to look me up the next time you come to town. And say hi to my pals, Teddy and Kathleen.” Dipper waved at them and then shook the reins. “Go ’long, mule,” he said.

The mule clopped over the brick street, pulling the coal cart away from the River Café.

Louis Armstrong was gone.



4. Potato Head Blues

“Wat now?” Jack said.

“We have to follow him,” said Annie. “We can’t let him out of our sight.”

Jack and Annie walked quickly after the mule cart. The hot brick road burned their feet. “Ow, ow, ow,” they both whispered.

“So let’s figure out—ow—what we’re going to say to him,” said Jack.

“Simple,” said Annie. “We’ll tell him we’d like to work with him. And then while we’re working, we’ll start talking to him about music. And put him on the right path to becoming the King of Jazz.”

“Hmm,” said Jack. It wasn’t much of a plan, but he couldn’t think of anything better.

Up ahead, Dipper’s mule cart stopped near the back of a candy shop.

“Hey, Dipper!” yelled Annie.

Dipper looked over his shoulder. He smiled. “What’s going on? Y’all are sticking to me like glue,” he said.

“Well, actually, we were wondering—” started Jack.

“If we could work with you?” finished Annie.

“Work with me?” said Dipper. “I’m just delivering coal.”

“Yeah, we know. We think it might be fun,” said Annie.

Dipper laughed. “Y’all are crazy,” he said.

“No, we’re not. We just like to work,” said Annie.

“Yeah, yeah, we really do,” said Jack.

Dipper laughed again. “Okay. I reckon there’s enough work to go around today,” he said. “There’s extra shovels and buckets in the cart.”

“Cool. Just tell us what to do, Dipper,” said Annie.

“Fill your buckets with coal and toss each bucket load into the bin,” said Dipper. He pointed to a large wooden box at the back of the small candy shop. “Twelve bucket loads should do it.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

Annie carefully set the magic trumpet on the ground near Dipper’s cart. Jack left his cloth bag beside it. Dipper handed each of them a heavy shovel and a tin bucket from the back of the cart. Then all three of them started shoveling coal.

Dipper whistled and worked quickly. But Jack and Annie had a hard time handling their heavy shovels. Whenever the shovels tipped to the side, all the coal fell off. Finally they both just grabbed pieces of coal with their hands and tossed them into their buckets.

The afternoon sun beat down on Jack’s back as he worked. He was sweaty and short of breath. His hands were black from picking up the coal, and his clothes were covered with coal dust. This is a terrible job, he thought. He wondered how Dipper could be so cheerful.



“So, Dipper,” said Annie, “do you like music?”

Dipper’s answer was drowned out as he dumped a load of coal into the bin.

“What’d you say?” Jack called to Dipper.

Dipper answered again, but Jack didn’t hear him because a buggy rumbled by. This is a bad time for a serious discussion, Jack thought. He could hardly think in the burning sun.

As Dipper shoveled more coal, he started singing a song that seemed to give words to how Jack felt:

I’ve got those coal cart blues.

I’m really all confused—

I’m about to lose my very mind.

But Dipper didn’t seem confused at all, or about to lose his mind. He had a warm, raspy voice, and his song had a lively beat.

“Dipper! Dipper! Dipper!” some kids called.

Dipper stopped singing. Three boys were running toward the coal cart. They were the singing trio Jack and Annie had seen on Jackson Square.

“I know you’re working,” said one of the kids. “But quit early today, Dipper! We just got a gig to sing in the parade.”

“Sorry, can’t do it, Little Mack,” said Dipper.

Little Mack wasn’t exactly little, Jack noticed. He looked like he weighed over two hundred pounds.

“Come on, Dipper,” said another boy.

“Gotta work, Happy,” said Dipper.

“Aww, Dipper,” said Happy. He didn’t look happy at all.

“Come on, Dipper!” said the third boy.

“Can’t do it, Big Nose,” said Dipper.

Jack looked at Big Nose’s nose. It was really quite small.

“Aww,” said Happy again.

“Go on now. Y’all sound just fine by yourselves,” said Dipper. “Go on to the parade and have fun.”

“But—” Big Nose began.

“Listen,” said Dipper. “Since sunup, I’ve delivered five cartloads of coal. I get paid fifteen cents a load. That makes seventy-five cents I’m going to take home to my family tonight. How much did you fellas make on the square today? How much you going to make in the parade?”

The three boys were silent.

“I’ve got a steady job now,” said Dipper. “You don’t need me. Go on to the parade and have a good time.”

The three boys stared at Dipper for a long moment. “Come on, fellas,” Little Mack said finally. “Let him be. Ever since he got back from the Waif’s Home, he’s turned into a mama’s boy.”

Jack wondered what the Waif’s Home was.

Dipper watched the three boys walk off. Then he looked at Jack and Annie. “Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney are old buddies of mine,” he explained with a sigh. “We used to have a quartet. We sang everywhere together.”

“Dipper, can’t you take just a little time off and go with your buddies to sing in the parade?” asked Annie.

“Nope,” said Dipper. “That’s just the way it has to be.”

Dipper went back to shoveling coal. Jack wanted to ask him about the Waif’s Home, but Dipper didn’t look like he wanted to talk. He didn’t sing anymore as he filled up his coal bucket.

If Dipper doesn’t perform, he’ll never grow up to be the King of Jazz, Jack thought. He’ll never give his gifts to the world.

Finally Annie broke the silence. “Dipper, do you have to support your family all by yourself? You’re pretty young for that, aren’t you?”

“I’m not young. I’m fourteen,” said Dipper. “Mama Lucy, Mayann, and baby Clarence are all depending on me.”

“Is that your family?” asked Jack.

“Yep, and I love them a lot,” said Dipper.

“I understand,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “But what about giving your gifts to the world?”

Dipper laughed. “I can’t afford gifts for Lady the mule. How am I going to afford gifts for the world?”

“What about your musical gifts?” asked Jack.

“Okay, good idea. I’ll sing a song to Lady on her birthday,” he said. “Let’s go now.”

Dipper tossed his shovel into the bucket. Then he reached into his pocket and took out some change. “Tomorrow I’ll be getting paid fifteen cents for this load,” he said. “In case I don’t see you again, here’s your share: five cents for you and five for you.”

“No, no, keep it,” said Annie. “You should keep it all for your family, Dipper.”

“What? That’s not right,” said Dipper.

“It is right,” said Jack.

“Then what did y’all do that work for?” asked Dipper.

“We didn’t do that much,” Jack said. “Not nearly as much as you did. It was a lot harder job than I thought it would be.”

“Then why did y’all keep working?” asked Dipper.

“It was fun hanging out with you,” said Annie.

Dipper laughed. “Well, you two sure are a couple of potato heads,” he said.

“What’s that mean?” asked Annie.

“It means you don’t have any more brains than a pair of potatoes,” said Dipper.

Jack and Annie just laughed.

“Sure you won’t take any money?” said Dipper.

“Absolutely!” said Annie.

“Well, thanks a million for your help,” said Dipper. He climbed back into the driver’s seat of the cart. “Hey want me and Lady to give y’all a ride back to the coal yard?”

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

“Good. Climb on!” said Dipper.

“Thanks, man!” said Jack.

Annie grabbed their trumpet. Jack grabbed his bag, and they sat on the cart bench next to Dipper. Jack was still hot and sweaty. He was tired and his arms were sore. But for some reason, he felt great.

“Let’s go, Lady,” said Dipper.

Lady the mule began pulling the creaky cart along the Mississippi River. And Dipper began singing again:

I’ve got those coal cart blues.

I’m really all confused…



5. Go Long, Mule

The sky had grown cloudy, and a warm breeze was blowing.

Dipper stopped the cart and listened. “Hear that?” he said. “Parade’s coming this way.”

Jack heard band music in the distance.

“Is that parade for All Saints’ Day?” asked Annie.

“Maybe. Or maybe for a million other things,” said Dipper. “Folks in this city will find any excuse for a parade.”

Soon the parade came into view.



Horseback riders wore plumed hats and black masks. Following them were people dressed up as clowns, kings, queens, fairies with fluttering wings, ghosts, and skeletons.

“We read that New Orleans might be the most haunted city in the country,” Annie said to Dipper, “especially on the eve of All Saints’ Day. We heard there’re real ghosts in a cathedral, a hotel, and a blacksmith shop.”

“Yeah, and plenty more places, too,” said Dipper. “But I’m not afraid of ghosts. I’m not afraid of anything.”

“Me neither!” said Annie.

“Um, me neither,” said Jack.

A band followed the people in costumes. The musicians were playing trumpets, tubas, trombones, and drums—lots of drums. The joyous music filled the New Orleans air. Jack and Annie couldn’t help nodding their heads in time to the beat. Jack noticed that Dipper was nodding his head, too.

“Hey, there’re the fellas!” said Annie.

Happy, Little Mack, and Big Nose Sidney were walking alongside the band, singing their hearts out.

“Looks like they’re having fun!” said Annie. She nudged Jack. “Doesn’t it?”

“Yeah!” said Jack. “A lot of fun! Music is so much fun! I wish I had musical talent! You’re so lucky, Dipper!”

“You really are, Dipper!” said Annie. “Musical talent is really a great gift to share with the world!”

Dipper just shook his head, as if he thought they were crazy. “Biggest potato heads I’ve ever met,” he said.

Jack and Annie laughed.

Dipper gave the reins a shake. “Go ’long, Lady. Keep me on my path.”

How weird that Dipper said that, Jack thought. Their mission was to keep him on the right path, too—the path to becoming the King of Jazz.

As Lady plodded along the bank of the Mississippi, Dipper started singing nonsense words:

Skid-dat-de-dat

Skid-dat-de-doo!



“That sounds so cool,” said Jack. “What’s that song?”

“Not a song. I’m just scat-singing, man,” said Dipper.

“Scat-singing?” said Annie. “What’s that?”

“When you can’t think of words, just sing sounds,” said Dipper. “Make ’em up. If you put your heart in it, folks will understand you.”

“I didn’t know a person could make music like that,” said Jack.

“Heck, yeah, you can make music any way you want,” said Dipper. “Just listen to the world: There’s church bells, the washerwoman singing about her wash, the ragman blasting his tin horn for folks to bring out their rags. Folks selling things, like that pie man. Listen to him.”

Dipper pointed to a man sitting in a red wagon, calling out in a strong, rich voice, “Sweet potato! Sweet potato pie! Lemon pie! Apple pie! Any pie you like!”

“Listen to that voice,” said Dipper. “That’s music. And listen to those sounds—” Dipper pointed to some women walking beside the road.

The women carried baskets on their heads and called out in singsong voices, “Blue-berries!” “Rasp-berries!” “Black-berrieeeeeeeeeeeeeees!”

“I see what you mean,” said Annie. “Music is everywhere.”

“You got it, girl,” said Dipper. “You can even hear it in Lady’s hoofbeats. Listen.”

Jack listened to the rhythmic clippity-clop, clippity-clop of the mule.

“See? There you go!” said Dipper. “That’s a song—Go ’long, mule, go ’long, mule.”

Jack and Annie listened to the steady music of Lady’s hoofbeats, until finally the mule came to a stop.

“Well, here we are at the coal yard,” said Dipper. “I’ll leave Lady here till tomorrow.”

They all jumped to the ground.

“Thanks for your music, Lady.” Dipper patted the mule on her nose. Then he turned to Jack and Annie. “Afraid I have to leave y’all now,” Dipper said. “But it’s been great.”

“Yeah, um…,” Jack began, trying to think of a good reason to stay with Dipper.

“I’d like to hear you blow that horn when the time’s right,” Dipper said to Annie. “And don’t forget to say hi to Teddy and Kathleen for me.” He winked, then waved and started walking away.

“But—but, Dipper!” called Jack.

“Sorry, man! I’m late!” Dipper shouted over his shoulder. “Thanks a million!” He waved again and kept going.

Jack and Annie looked at each other in a panic. “We have to stay with him!” said Annie. “Wait, wait, Dipper!” She and Jack ran after him.

“Where are you going now?” Jack asked.

“My next job,” said Dipper. “I have to haul bananas till dark.”

“Really? Another job?” said Jack.

“Hey guess what?” shouted Annie. “We love to haul bananas!”

“Yeah. Yeah, we do,” said Jack.

Dipper stopped and stared at them. “What is wrong with y’all?” he said. “Don’t you know how to have fun?”

Jack didn’t know what to say.

“Seriously,” said Annie. “We do love to haul bananas. And you make everything more fun with your singing.”

“Yeah, you’re a good singer!” piped up Jack. “That’s a gift!”

Dipper just shook his head. “Remember when I said you didn’t have any more brains than a pair of potatoes? Well, I take it back. I don’t think you have one potato’s brain between you.”

Jack and Annie laughed.

“Well, come on, then,” said Dipper.

Jack and Annie hurried with Dipper down to the loading dock on the riverfront. At least fifty workers were hauling huge loads of bananas out of the cargo hold of a ship.

“Wait here,” Dipper told them.

Dipper walked over to a man checking people in to work. He pointed to Jack and Annie. The man shrugged, then nodded. Dipper waved for them to come join him.

Jack and Annie ran down to join Dipper and the other workers in the cargo hold. Dipper picked up a giant bunch of bananas. The bunch was almost as big as Annie! He hauled it onto his shoulder and then picked up another one.

“Grab a bunch of bananas and follow me!” Dipper said. He headed to the counter, where men in white suits were inspecting the banana bunches.

“No way either of us can pick up one of those bunches,” Jack said to Annie.

“Let’s try it together,” said Annie.

Annie hid their trumpet behind a large wooden box. Jack put his bag there, too. Jack and Annie loaded a bunch of bananas into their arms. They walked closely together, taking short, clumsy steps, following Dipper. They delivered the bunch to the inspectors and then hurried back to get another.

As the sun sank toward the river, Jack, Annie, and Dipper hauled bananas back and forth between the cargo hold and the inspectors. They hauled bananas until it was almost dark. Jack was so tired he could hardly see straight. He was afraid Dipper would never call it quits.

“Last one,” Dipper said finally.

Yes! thought Jack. They grabbed their last loads.

Suddenly a large rat jumped out of the cargo hold! Dipper let out a scream. He dropped his bananas and took off running. Annie and Jack dropped their bananas, too. Annie grabbed her trumpet. Jack grabbed his bag, and they ran after Dipper.

Running like crazy, Dipper led Jack and Annie far from the loading area—and the rat. When he finally stopped, Jack bumped into Dipper, and Annie bumped into Jack. They all started laughing. Dipper laughed the hardest. He collapsed on the curb of Decatur Street and laughed so hard his whole body shook. Jack and Annie sat down next to him, laughing until they cried. Finally they all managed to calm down.

“I know… I know I said I wasn’t afraid of anything,” Dipper said breathlessly. “But I lied. I’m afraid of one thing: rats. Rats give me the heebie-jeebies.”



“Yeah, yeah,” Annie said, catching her breath. “I know how you feel. Spiders give me the heebie-jeebies.”

“Yeah,” Jack said, panting. “Yeah, actually, ghosts give ’em to me.”

“That’s cool, that’s cool, man,” said Dipper. “Between the three of us, we got all the scaredy stuff covered.”

That made them all start laughing again. As the twilight deepened, they sat on the curb, catching their breath. They laughed now and then, out of relief and friendship.

Then Dipper stood up. “Before we part ways, I better get our pay from the boss. Hold on.”

Jack and Annie kept sitting on the curb as Dipper ran back down to the dock. “Part ways? We can’t part ways yet,” said Jack.

“I know!” said Annie. “We haven’t even begun to accomplish our mission.”

“Umbrella! Buy an umbrella!” a man shouted as he walked by. He carried a load of umbrellas on his back. “Storm a-comin’! Big storm comin’ for the eve of All Saints’!”

“Oh, no, now a storm’s coming,” said Jack. He was confused about what they should do next.

A moment later, Dipper returned. “Thirty cents!” he said. “We each get ten.”

“No, no, Dipper,” said Annie. “Please use it to take care of your family.”

“Yeah, do that,” said Jack.

“We insist,” said Annie.

Dipper smiled. “Oh, you do, do you? Why? What’s this game y’all are playing?”

“It’s no game,” said Jack.

“We’re just a couple of potato heads,” said Annie. “Get used to it.”

“Well, then, you two potato heads, let me give you something else,” said Dipper. “Come along with me.”

“Great!” said Jack. They weren’t “parting ways” yet! He and Annie jumped up from the curb and bounded off with Dipper.


6. Find Me at the Greasy Spoon


Streetlamps were coming on as Jack, Annie, and Dipper walked away from Jackson Square. When they came to Bourbon Street, vendors walked the sidewalks, calling out, “Ice cream!” “Lemon pie!” “Ham biscuits!”

“Hmm. Sounds good,” said Annie. “There seems to be lots of good food in New Orleans.”

“Best in the world!” said Dipper.

People were sitting outside dance halls and restaurants, laughing and talking, eating and drinking. Outside and inside, musicians were blaring away on their instruments.

“Hey, there’s Dipper! Sing something for us, Dipper!” the ice cream lady yelled.

Dipper waved and kept going.

“Hey, girl, can you play that trumpet?” a man called to Annie.

“Not till the time’s right!” Annie shouted.

“When’s that?” the man said.

“She’ll know it when she feels it!” Dipper shouted.

At the end of the block, under a streetlamp, a trio was singing in harmony. It was Little Mac, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney.

“Look, Dipper, it’s your friends again,” said Annie.

“I see ’em,” said Dipper. But he ignored the three boys and crossed the street.

Dipper led Jack and Annie down a narrow alley to the back of a shabby, run-down building. Good cooking smells came from inside. “Y’all wait for me outside this greasy spoon,” he said, and he slipped through the back door.

“What’s a greasy spoon?” asked Annie.

“Smells like it must be a restaurant,” said Jack.

Annie put down the trumpet. Jack put down his bag. They sat on the back steps of the greasy spoon. While they waited in the muggy twilight for Dipper, Jack wiped his forehead. He was starving and ached all over.

Soon Dipper pushed open the back door with his foot. He was carrying a big bowl and a tall glass. “I got us some gumbo stew and some lemonade to share!” he said. “Talk about good!”

“Oh, man, thanks,” breathed Jack.

Dipper sat between Jack and Annie on the steps. He pulled spoons out of his pocket for each of them. “Dig in, y’all!” he said.

Together the three of them tackled the gumbo stew. They all ate their fill of spicy chicken, ham, tomatoes, okra, onions, and rice. When the bowl was empty, they shared the tall glass of lemonade. Then they sat back on the steps and heaved big sighs. Jack felt stuffed and happy.

“Mighty fine,” breathed Dipper.

“Mighty fine,” echoed Jack.

“Mighty fine,” said Annie.

“Nothing tastes as good as gumbo after a hard day’s work,” said Dipper. He stood up. “Well, I have to leave y’all now. Thanks a million for your help today. And don’t forget to thank Teddy and Kathleen for sending y’all to find me.” Before Jack and Annie could stop him, Dipper climbed down the steps and vanished into the dark.

“Dipper?” called Jack.

There was no answer.

“He’s gone again!” said Annie.

“And we totally failed in our mission for Merlin,” said Jack. “We didn’t help Dipper get on the right path to give his gifts to the world.”

“I know. We have to find him. Come on,” said Annie. She hopped up and headed after Dipper.

“Wait, the trumpet!” said Jack. He grabbed the magic trumpet and his bag and followed her.

When Jack left the steps, it was too dark for him to see where Annie had gone. Thunder rumbled in the distance. The air felt heavy and thick as if the storm were about to break at any moment.

“Annie!” Jack called.

“Here!” Annie called back from the front of the restaurant. Jack joined her. Together they peeked through a window that looked into a large kitchen. Dipper was alone, washing a mountain of dishes.

“Why’s he doing that?” whispered Jack.

“Hey Dipper!” said Annie.

Dipper turned and smiled. “You caught me,” he said. He looked embarrassed.

“Why are you washing dishes?” asked Annie.

Dipper shrugged. “Got to pay for our dinner somehow,” he said.

“We’ll help you,” said Annie.

“We love washing dishes!” said Jack.

Dipper laughed. “Then come on in, potato heads,” he said. “I could use some help.”

Jack and Annie slipped through a side door into the hot, steamy kitchen.

Jack put down his bag and the trumpet. He and Annie picked up dirty plates from the counter. They began scraping leftovers into a garbage pail. They scraped fish heads, oyster shells, crab legs, shrimp tails, chicken bones, grease, and gravy off dozens of plates.

The work was messy and smelly. But Jack and Annie worked hard to keep up with Dipper. Every time he took a plate from them, he smiled and said, “Thank you.” He never frowned or complained or even seemed tired.

“Dipper,” said Annie while they worked, “your life seems really hard. How do you stay so cheerful?”

“Why not? It’s more fun to be cheerful than sad,” he said.

“Don’t you ever feel like getting mad or complaining about stuff?” said Jack.

“Sure I do, I’m human,” said Dipper. “I feel all kinds of things. All day long I feel things. You could say I have a rich life. I might not get to have everything. But I get to feel everything!” He laughed.

“I’m the same way,” said Annie.

“I thought so,” said Dipper. “That’s why I sure would like to hear you play that trumpet sometime.”

“Maybe you will,” said Annie.

By the time they finished washing dishes, rain was falling outside.

“Where to now?” said Jack.

“One more treat for y’all,” said Dipper. “Let’s leave this greasy spoon and head back down to the river. To the River Café for dessert! Come on.”

“We better not,” said Jack. “The waiters there don’t like us.”

“Don’t worry about them,” said Dipper. “You’re with me now.”

Jack and Annie followed Dipper outside into the rain. The wind was blowing harder now. “Uh-oh,” said Dipper. “Here comes the storm! Let’s hurry!”

Thunder cracked and rain began to pour down. The three of them got soaked as they hurried through the alley back to Bourbon Street.

The street was empty now. Partygoers and street musicians had fled from the storm. The restaurants and cafés had taken their chairs and tables inside. Lightning lit the sky, and thunder shook the ground. The wind was blowing hard, picking up sticks and leaves and trash.

“We have to find cover!” said Dipper. “Run!” He and Jack and Annie bowed their heads against the downpour and ran up Bourbon Street.

“Dipper! Over here, man!” someone yelled. It was Little Mack.

Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney were waving to Dipper from the doorway of a dark building on a corner. Dipper, Jack, and Annie ran across the street through the pounding rain.

“Get over here, out of the street!” shouted Little Mack. “Before you get hit by lightning!”

“Thanks, fellas!” said Dipper.

Soaking wet, Jack, Annie, Dipper, Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney all crowded together just inside the dark building, looking out at the storm.

“Who lives here?” asked Dipper.

“Nobody. It’s been empty for years,” said Happy.

“Used to be a blacksmith shop,” said Little Mack.

“Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop?” said Jack. He immediately stepped out of the shop and stood under the eaves.

“Yeah, what’s wrong with that?” asked Little Mack.



“We read this place is haunted!” said Annie.

“Y’all believe in ghosts?” asked Little Mack.

“No, not really,” said Jack.

“But I thought you said they gave you the heebie—” started Dipper.

“No, no, I was kidding,” Jack said quickly. He didn’t want Dipper’s friends to know he was afraid of ghosts.

Lightning split the sky again. Another crash of thunder shattered the night. The wind blew so hard that shingles blew off the roof across the street and crashed to the sidewalk.

“Whoa! Come inside, man, we gotta close the door,” Dipper said to Jack.

“Hold on,” said Little Mack. “We have to go.”

“We do?” asked Happy.

Little Mack whispered something to Happy and Big Nose Sidney.

“Oh, yeah, he’s right,” said Happy. “We have to leave. We’ll see y’all later.”

“Y’all are scared to stay here, aren’t you?” said Dipper.

“No, man. We forgot we have an important gig to play,” said Big Nose Sidney.

“Oh. Suddenly y’all have got an important gig. I see…,” said Dipper.

“Yeah, we’ll have to try to make it through the storm. See y’all! Come on, fellas!” said Little Mack.

The three boys hurried out of the blacksmith shop and turned the corner.

“They left ’cause they’re scaredy-cats,” said Dipper, chuckling.

“Yeah,” said Jack, “scaredy-cats.”

Thunder cracked the sky again, the loudest crack so far. It seemed to shake the whole block. Roof shingles flew through the air.

“Come back inside!” said Dipper. “It’s dangerous out there.”

Jack took a deep breath and stepped back into Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop.



7. Skid-Dat-De-Dat!

Dipper closed the door.

It was pitch-black inside the shop. As the wind howled outside, the broken shutters banged against the brick walls. A gust of damp air blew through the room.

“It’s dark in here,” said Annie. “And cold.”

“It’s creepy,” said Jack.

“Yup,” said Dipper. “Let’s leave. I’ve changed my mind about staying here. We can find some other place to get out of the storm.”

“Good idea,” said Annie.

“Great idea!” said Jack.

Jack heard Dipper rattle the door handle. “Uh-oh,” said Dipper.

“Uh-oh what?” said Jack.

“Won’t open,” said Dipper. “It’s stuck.”

Jack felt the hair rise on the back of his neck. The shutters banged in the wind.

“Hold on a second, I’ve got some matches in my pocket,” said Dipper. “I just hope they didn’t get wet in the rain.”

Jack heard Dipper trying to strike a match. He tried one, two, three times—then he held up a small flame.

“Yay” breathed Annie.

Jack looked around the room. In the dancing light, he could make out wooden buckets on the floor, a couple of broken chairs, a doorway leading to a back room, and— Squeak! A bat flapped above their heads.

“Ahhh!” Jack, Annie, and Dipper ducked.

The match went out.

Dipper quickly lit another match. He held it up high, trying to light the room. Jack didn’t see the bat, but he saw a bricked-over fireplace, some rusty lanterns, and lots of spiderwebs.



“Yikes!” said Annie.

The match went out.

“Help,” said Annie in a small voice. “More light, please.”

“Nobody panic,” said Dipper. “I got two matches left.”

“Just two?” said Annie.

“Hey, I thought I saw some lanterns,” said Jack. “Near the fireplace. Maybe we could light them.”

“Good idea,” said Dipper. “Maybe there’s oil still in ’em. I just hope I can light the wicks. Or we’ll be left in the dark with the bats.”

“And spiders,” said Annie.

And ghosts, Jack thought.

Dipper struck his next-to-last match. He held it up to find the lanterns.

“Over here,” said Jack, pointing.

“I see,” said Dipper. But as he knelt on the floor, the match went out. “I got just one more,” he whispered. “So we better be real careful.”

Dipper lit his last match. Jack slowly lifted the glass on both the lanterns. Very carefully, Dipper touched the match flame to the wick of the first lantern. The wick sputtered and flickered to life. A yellow glow filled the room.

“Ahh!” said Dipper. He lit the second lantern. “Beautiful. You can each carry one.”

Jack picked up one of the lanterns. Annie put down her trumpet and picked up the other one. The firelight cast eerie shadows on the walls.

Screeeee!

A sound from the back room startled them. It sounded like the creak of a door opening. Jack’s heart began to pound.

WHAM! The sound of a door slamming shut!

Jack’s heart beat faster and faster.

“Hey!” called Dipper. “Who’s back there?”

No one answered.

Clump. Clump. Clump. The sound of footsteps on stairs!

Jack held his breath.

“Who’s there?” yelled Dipper.

“WOOOOOOO!”

“Show yourself!” yelled Dipper.

The shutters outside banged harder against the walls.

“WOOOOOOO!”

“Mercy,” whispered Dipper.

Jack’s hand trembled, shaking the lantern and making the shadows in the room dance even more wildly.

The moaning came again: “WOOOOOOO!”

“Annie!” said Jack. “The trumpet! The time is right!”

“I know it! I feel it!” said Annie. She put down her lantern and grabbed the trumpet. “Sing, Jack!”

Annie lifted the magic trumpet to her lips and blew. A pure, smooth sound flowed from the trumpet and filled the room. As Annie played, Jack started singing:

Ghost, ghost,

Leave us alone!

Stop, stop!

Stop your moan… ing!

What a stupid song, Jack thought, but they were the only words that came to his mind. Then he remembered Dipper’s advice: When you can’t think of words, just sing sounds. Make ’em up. Put your heart in it.

So Jack started singing nonsense sounds. He sang with all his heart, pouring all his feelings into the sounds, telling the ghost to go:

Skid-dat-de-dat!

Skid-dat-de-dow!

Skiddle-skiddle

Daddle-daddle

Outta here NOW!

Thumping noises came from the other room, as if heavy things were falling.

“Who’s there?” shouted Dipper.

Annie stopped playing.

Jack stepped back in fear, waiting for something awful to happen. Then he heard laughing and whispering.

“Hey!” shouted Dipper. He picked up Annie’s lantern and headed into the other room. Jack and Annie followed.

Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney were crawling toward the back door.

“Stop!” yelled Dipper. “What are y’all doing here?”

The three boys all talked at once: “We fell out of the attic!” “Felt like something was pushing us out!” “Yeah! Then down the stairs and toward the door!”

“Jack’s song pushed you downstairs!” said Annie, laughing. “He ordered the ghost to leave us alone! His singing was magic.”

“Your playing was magic, too!” Dipper said to Annie. “You two really put your hearts in it.”

“Thanks,” said Jack.

Dipper looked down at Little Mack. “Now tell us what you three fools were up to!” he said.

“We decided to play a joke on y’all,” said Little Mack. “So we snuck through the back door and up to the attic.”

“We thought you left because you were scared of ghosts!” said Annie.

“Heck no, man,” said Little Mack.

“We’re not afraid of ghosts,” said Happy.

“Not even a little bit,” said Big Nose Sidney.

Suddenly a cold wind blasted through the room. The lanterns flickered out. An eerie green light lit the blacksmith shop.

“WHAT?” a voice roared. “NOT AFRAID OF GHOSTS?”

The voice seemed to come from everywhere—and nowhere.

“AHHHHHHH!” the kids all screamed together.

“HAH-HAH-HAH!” Mean-sounding laughter echoed through the shop. It grew louder and louder. “HAH-HAH-HAH!”

“AHHHHHHH!” the kids all screamed again.

Stomping noises thundered in the attic overhead.

Everyone shrieked and froze with terror.

Down from the attic came a pirate. His face was hidden by the brim of a black hat. He wore a gray jacket with a double row of buttons, a red sash, and dark pants tucked inside black boots.

The pirate looked like a real person, except you could see right through him.


8. Heebie Jeebies


Tunder shook the night. The wind howled. The pirate ghost floated down the stairs.

“The ghost of Jean Lafitte!” whispered Annie.

The ghost pointed a bony finger at Happy. “NOT AFRAID OF GHOSTS?” his voice boomed again. He pointed at Big Nose Sidney. “NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT? HAH-HAH-HAH!”

“AHHHHHHH!” everyone shrieked again. They all scrambled out of the back room to the front room. They pushed on the front door together. But the door still wouldn’t open.

“SCURVY DOGS! YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME!” the ghost of Jean Lafitte shouted.

The pirate ghost floated to the center of the room and stopped. He rested his hands on his hips, threw back his head, and laughed again. “YOU’RE TRAPPED NOW!” Jean Lafitte roared. “TRAPPED HERE FOREVER!”

To Jack’s horror, more ghost pirates began gliding through the walls into the room. One at a time they came: a pirate with a gold earring, another with a pistol, one with a head scarf, another with an eye patch, one with a saber, another with a bushy beard, one with a thin mustache, another with a sack, one with a striped shirt, another with a peg leg.

Finally ten ghost pirates circled the room!

From the center of the circle, Jean Lafitte let out another peal of mean laughter. “HAH-HAH-HAH!”

The pirate crew snorted, snarled, and growled, “YARRR! ARGHH! ARRL!”

Suddenly Jack started singing:

Skiddle-diddle dog!

Hey, hey, hey!

Ghost, go away,

Go away, go away!



“Jack!” said Annie. “What are you doing?”

“Play Annie! Play!” squeaked Jack.

“I can’t!” said Annie. “We used up the magic! It’s just an ordinary trumpet now!”

“Here, give it to me!” said Dipper.

Annie handed Dipper the trumpet.

Dipper put the trumpet to his lips. He closed his eyes. He took a deep breath, and then he blew. The air vibrated with a single warm note. Then Dipper’s fingers danced over the trumpet’s valves. A lively, swinging tune filled the blacksmith shop.

Jean Lafitte stopped laughing his mean laugh. He held up his hands for his crew to be silent. As Dipper played, crooked smiles crossed the pirates’ faces.

Dipper’s joyful music drowned out the noise of the storm outside. Annie snatched two rungs from a broken chair. She used them as drumsticks, tapping them against a wooden bucket. Jack grabbed two more rungs and did the same.

Dipper paused long enough to yell to his trio, “Hey, boys! Sing the Heebie-Jeebie song!”

“We don’t know it!” said Little Mack.

“Make somethin’ up!” called Dipper.

As Dipper played the trumpet, Little Mack sang:

I got the heebies!

You got the jeebies!



Then Happy sang:

The heebies make you hop!

And the jeebies make you quake!



Then Big Nose Sidney sang:

Do a little dance, Mama!

Stomp and shake!



As the trio sang, the ghost of Jean Lafitte started to dance. He shook his head and clapped his hands. He waved his arms through the air. He turned in a circle. “Go, Mama, go!” he shouted.

Lafitte’s crew began dancing like their captain. All the ghost pirates moved in a circle, shaking their heads and waving their hands. Some floated off the floor, turning this way and that.

Little Mack sang:

Hey, Papa! Hey, Mama!

Hey! Hey! Hey!



“Hey, hey, hey!” all the pirates shouted. “Hey, hey, hey!”

Dipper played the trumpet. Jack and Annie drummed on the bucket. The trio sang. The floor shook. The windows rattled. And all the pirates stomped and shook, doing the Heebie-Jeebie dance.

“SWING THAT MUSIC!” shouted Jean Lafitte’s ghost.



“YARR!” the pirates all shouted. “YARR! YARR!”

The front door suddenly banged open.

“GO, MAMA! GO, PAPA! GO! GO! GO!” shouted the ghost of Jean Lafitte. He danced out of the shop, and his pirate crew followed, one by one.

As the ghosts all danced out of the shop, Dipper kept playing. The trio kept singing, and Jack and Annie kept drumming.

“MY CREW AND I SURE ENJOYED YOUR VISIT!” the pirate ghost captain shouted back to Dipper and the others. “BE SURE TO COME BACK! SAME TIME NEXT YEAR!”

The ghost of Jean Lafitte turned and waved his arms in the air again. “COME ON, BOYS! PAPA’S DOIN’ THE HEEBIE-JEEBIES DANCE!” Then, doing the Heebie-Jeebies dance, all the pirate ghosts danced away into the dark New Orleans night.


9. Working Man Blues


Dipper stopped playing. The three boys stopped singing. Jack and Annie stopped drumming.

There was silence. They all crept to the open doorway and stepped outside. The rain had stopped, and the wind had died down. The air felt clean and cool. Stars shone overhead. The pirate ghosts were gone.

“Whoa, that was something!” said Little Mack. “What just happened?”

“Was it a dream?” asked Big Nose Sidney. “Were those ghosts real?”

“I don’t know,” said Dipper. “But I’ll tell you this: you’ll never, ever get me back in that shop again.”

Everyone laughed. Even Happy looked happy. “Hey, Dipper, how’d you get so good on that horn?” he asked, grinning.

“I practiced for two years at the Waif’s Home,” said Dipper. “That’s how.”

“You got to blow that horn while we sing!” said Big Nose Sidney. “Come with us now! We really do have an important gig tonight on a riverboat!”

“A riverboat?” Jack and Annie said together. They looked at each other. Their research book said that Louis Armstrong developed his musical talents performing on riverboats!

“That’s right,” said Little Mack.

“Oh, wow, Dipper, you have to go with them!” said Annie.

“Yeah, man!” said Jack.

But Dipper just shook his head. “Sorry, folks, but I can’t play tonight. I have to get up early in the morning to haul coal.”

“Aww, Dipper,” said Little Mack.

“Aww, Dipper,” said Jack.

“Don’t y’all worry about me,” said Dipper. “Have a good time on the boat, fellas. Hang on to that smile, Happy.”

“I’ll try,” said Happy.

“See you later,” said Big Nose Sidney.

“So long to y’all, too,” Little Mack said to Jack and Annie.

“Bye,” said Jack.

“Good luck on your gig,” said Annie. The three boys waved and took off.

Dipper looked after them for a long moment. Then he turned to Jack and Annie.

“Here’s your horn back,” he said. “Thanks for letting me play it.” He handed the trumpet to Annie.

“Do you want to keep it?” she said.

“No, thanks. I have my own horn back at my house, a cornet they gave me at the Waif’s Home,” said Dipper. “Someday when I’m grown, maybe I’ll bring it out again.”

“I think you should have gone with the fellas, Dipper,” said Jack, “to share your musical gifts—”

“I know, I know,” said Dipper, “to share my musical gifts with the world.” He shook his head as if he were shaking off the thought. Then he beamed a big smile at Jack and Annie. “Hey! Weren’t we talking about dessert a little while back? That’s a gig I can get behind and still get some sleep. Come on!”

As Dipper led Jack and Annie down the rain-slicked street, the wet sidewalks glistened like silver. Life had returned to the French Quarter. Horses and mules splashed through puddles. Streetlamps burned brightly outside dance halls and restaurants. Waiters carried tables and chairs back outside.

When Dipper, Jack, and Annie came to Jackson Square, they found kids playing music again. A band was playing a song Jack knew: “When the Saints Go Marching In.” A few people in costumes were wandering about.

Dipper led Jack and Annie to the back door of the River Café. “The cook here is a friend of mine. So don’t worry about the waiters,” he said with a wink. “Be back in a minute.” He slipped into the café kitchen.

As Jack and Annie waited for Dipper, they could hear the jazzy music coming from the square:

Oh, when the saints go marching in,

Oh, when the saints go marching in.



“Teddy was right. I love New Orleans,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “But how are we ever going to accomplish our mission for Merlin? Dipper seems like he’s never going to change his mind about making music.”

“I know,” said Annie. “In fact, I was just thinking that we might have to do something really drastic.”

“What’s that?” said Jack.

“Show him our research book,” said Annie.

“Whoa!” said Jack. “Do you really think—”

Before Jack could finish, Dipper came back outside. “Mmm-mmm! Talk about something good!” he said. He clutched a greasy napkin filled with freshly made doughnuts. “Follow me.”

As Jack and Annie followed Dipper to the river, Jack’s mind was racing. Should they show Dipper the research book? It would prove they’d come from the future. What would Dipper say? What would he think? It’s too weird, Jack thought.

“Let’s just try talking to him first,” Jack whispered to Annie. She nodded.

Dipper led them to a bench near the water. Jack and Annie sat on the wet wood on either side of him. Dipper unwrapped the doughnuts and handed one to Jack and one to Annie and kept one for himself.

“Careful,” Dipper said. “The sugar will get all over y’all.”

Jack lifted the warm, sticky doughnut to his mouth and took a big bite. Powdered sugar, flour, butter, vanilla—all melted in his mouth. It was mighty good.

Nobody talked while they ate their doughnuts. When they were finished, they all wiped their sticky fingers on their shirts and pants. By now, Jack’s clothes were soaked with rainwater, coal dust, kitchen grease, sweat, and grime. A little powdered sugar and butter won’t make a bit of difference, he thought.

“So, Dipper,” said Annie. “You know you’re a really great musician, don’t you?”

Dipper smiled at her.

“Actually, you’re a creative genius,” added Jack.

Dipper laughed out loud. “And y’all know who you are, don’t you?”

“Yup, the biggest potato heads you ever met,” finished Jack.

“But this time we’re right,” said Annie.

“Nope, sorry,” said Dipper. “I’m definitely no genius. The truth is I never got past elementary school. I don’t even know how to read music.”

“But don’t you love to play music?” said Annie.

“Yeah, sure, I do. Somehow I’ve got music in my bones,” said Dipper. “Sad to say, all I really ever want to do is blow my horn.”

“Then why don’t you?” said Jack. He felt desperate. Even without their mission for Merlin, it seemed incredibly sad that Dipper had turned his back on his music.

“Yeah, why don’t you go play on the riverboat with the fellas?” said Annie. “It wouldn’t hurt you to miss a few hours’ sleep.”

Dipper took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “When I was twelve years old, I got too rowdy one time,” he said. “It was New Year’s Eve. I was singing with the fellas, and I got carried away and fired off a gun… just into the air. I wasn’t trying to hurt anybody. But I got caught and I got sentenced to two years in the Waif’s Home. I just got out a little while ago. I feel really bad for letting my family down like that. So right now, all I want to do is help them by keeping a steady job.”

“But what about a job playing music?” said Jack. “Great musicians can make a lot of money and help their families.”

“Not playing the music I want to play” said Dipper. “At least I haven’t met any. Have you?”

“Yes. Actually we have,” said Annie. She turned and looked at Jack. “We have to do it.”

Jack sighed, then nodded slowly. Annie was right. He reached into his bag and pulled out their research book.


10. Thanks a Million


Jack pushed his glasses into place and opened A History of New Orleans Music.

“What’s that, man?” Dipper asked.

“It’s a history book,” said Jack.

“Teddy and Kathleen gave it to us,” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah, my best friends,” said Dipper.

Jack looked in the index of the book. He found the right page and turned to it.

“I’m going to read something to you, man,” said Jack. “Just listen.” And Jack read:

As a young teenager, Louis Armstrong often performed with “kid bands” on the streets of the city. Eventually he played with older musicians in dance halls, and he developed his musical talents performing on Mississippi river-boats. When he was twenty-one, he moved to Chicago, where he played in the well-known band of his old friend Joe Oliver.

“Joe Oliver?” said Dipper. “Joe’s in that book? I’m in that book?”

“Yep. Hold on, there’s more,” said Jack. He read:

Over time, Louis Armstrong became world-famous, but he always called New Orleans home. The city honored him by naming a large park the Louis Armstrong Park. It also named its airport the Louis Armstrong International Airport.



“What’s that? International airport?” asked Dipper.

“That’s where planes fly in and out from all over the world,” said Annie.

Dipper started laughing. “Y’all are pulling my leg.”

“No,” said Jack. “We’re not. Look at this, Dipper.” He held up the book and showed Dipper the picture of Louis Armstrong, the King of Jazz, playing the trumpet in front of a huge crowd. “That’s you, Dipper.”

Jack waited for Dipper to laugh and say the picture wasn’t him. But Dipper stopped smiling and nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, I’ve seen that picture before,” he said softly.



“You have?” said Jack, stunned.

“You’ve seen this picture before?” said Annie. “Where?”

“Here.” Dipper touched his chest. “Here, in my heart. It’s the picture I’ve had in my heart for a long time, like a dream. Hey, y’all, is this a dream?”

Jack and Annie laughed. Annie smiled. “Yes, you could say that,” she said.

“But it’s a true dream,” said Jack.

“Keep that picture in your heart, Dipper,” said Annie. “Hold it close to you, and one day you’ll be living it. We promise.”

For a long time the three of them just stared at the picture. When Jack looked at Dipper again, he saw tears glisten in Dipper’s eyes.

“Okay, I’ll do that,” said Dipper. He wiped his eyes with the palms of his hands. “I think I can keep my jobs and start making a little room for my music, too.”

“Yes!” said Annie.

“Maybe you should go play with the fellas on the riverboat tonight,” said Jack.

“Yeah, maybe I’ll try and do that,” said Dipper.

“Great!” said Annie.

Jack heaved a sigh and put away their book.

Dipper stood up. “But now y’all have to get going. On the eve of All Saints’ Day, there’s a curfew for kids under thirteen. They have to be off the streets by nine, or the paddy wagon will pick ’em up.”

“So… you’re definitely on the path to sharing your musical gift with the world. Right, man?” asked Jack.

Dipper laughed. “I reckon I am,” he said. “Thanks to a couple of potato heads.”

“Okay, good,” said Jack. He and Annie stood up. “To get home, we need to walk to Bourbon Street and catch a streetcar to Canal Street.”

“Let’s go,” said Dipper.

The three of them left the waterfront. They walked past Jackson Square and headed past the cathedral on St. Peter Street.

“I’ll walk y’all back to Bourbon Street,” said Dipper.

“Then do you have time to ride back with us to Canal Street?” said Annie. “So we can hang out together a little longer on the train?”

“You know I can’t do that,” said Dipper. “They won’t let me sit with y’all on the streetcar.”

“Why not?” asked Jack.

“I’d have to sit in the back while y’all sit up front,” said Dipper.

“What are you talking about?” said Annie.

“Y’all are white. I’m black,” said Dipper.

“So?” said Annie.

“Black folks aren’t allowed to sit with white folks. That’s the way it is,” said Dipper.

“Are you kidding? That’s crazy!” said Annie.

“No, I’m not kidding,” said Dipper. He stopped walking and looked closely at Jack and Annie. “Where are y’all from? How’d you get that crazy history book with my picture in it? And why did y’all come here to find me?”

“It’s really, really hard to explain, Dipper,” said Jack. “But just know this: one day things are going to change. Everybody will sit together on trains and buses and planes.”

“And one day an African American man will run for president of the United States,” said Annie. “And millions of people—of all colors—will vote for him.”

“And he’ll win!” said Jack.

Dipper laughed and shook his head. “Okay, now I know I’m dreaming,” he said, “but I really like this dream.”

“It’s the truth,” said Annie. “We promise.”

By now they had come to the corner of St. Peter and Bourbon Street. “This is where I leave you,” said Dipper.

Annie threw her arms around Dipper and gave him a big hug. “Good-bye, Dipper!”

Jack did the same. “Bye, man,” he said. “Thanks a million.”

“Same to you,” said Dipper. “Hey, there’s your streetcar now.”

The streetcar glided to a stop at the corner. Jack and Annie hopped aboard and sat in front. As the streetcar went up Bourbon Street, they stuck their heads out the window and waved to Dipper. He waved back. Jack and Annie waved and waved, until they couldn’t see Dipper anymore.


11. Swing that Music


As the streetcar rumbled down Canal Street, Jack looked over his shoulder. Dipper was right. African Americans were sitting in the back, while only white people were in the front. Jack hadn’t even noticed it on their first streetcar ride.

Jack’s heart felt heavy. Why would anyone not want to sit next to someone just because they are a different color? he wondered. How could anyone ever be mean to Dipper? Dipper, who is gentle and friendly and kind? Dipper, who hears music everywhere?

Jack listened to the click-clack of the streetcar rolling down the tracks. The sound had a good beat. Jack tapped his hand against his knee, until the streetcar came to a stop.

“Let’s go,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie stood up. Canal Street was bright with lights. People were still selling things on the sidewalk.

“What time is it, please?” Jack asked the conductor.

“Five minutes after nine, boy,” said the conductor. “Y’all better head for home.”

“We are!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie hopped off the streetcar and started to run. They ran to the bottom of Canal Street and crossed to the palm trees in the grove near the Mississippi River. In the dark, they found the rope ladder and scrambled up it into the tree house.

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book that would take them home.

“Wait!” said Annie, looking out the window. “Look!”

A brightly lit Mississippi showboat was rolling up the river. A large paddle wheel behind the boat was churning the water. Music was coming from on board.



Annie grabbed Jack’s arm. “Listen! The ‘Heebie-Jeebies’!” she said.

Jack listened. He could hear the trio singing: Little Mack, Happy, and Big Nose Sidney. But the best sound of all was the bright sound of a horn sailing through the New Orleans night.

“It’s Dipper!” said Annie. “It’s got to be!”

“He caught the boat!” said Jack. “Just in time!”

Jack and Annie listened to the joyful swinging sound of Dipper’s music until the riverboat rolled out of sight.

Jack heaved a happy sigh. Then he pointed at their Pennsylvania book. “I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Jack and Annie were wearing their own clothes again. Rain tapped gently against the roof of the tree house. A cool breeze blew through the window.

“We have to get home before Mom and Dad wake up,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. He pulled A History of New Orleans Music out of his backpack and left it on the floor.

Annie put the trumpet beside it. Then they headed down the rope ladder. They pulled up their rain hoods. As they tramped in their boots through the wet autumn woods, they were both quiet.

Finally Annie said, “I feel good.”

“I feel good, too,” said Jack. “We accomplished our mission.”

“But I feel other things, too,” said Annie. “I feel mad that Dipper couldn’t sit on the streetcar with us.”

“Me too,” said Jack. “And it wasn’t just in New Orleans. A long time ago, they had laws like that in lots of places.”

“Unbelievable,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“And I feel scared when I think of those spiders in their webs,” said Annie.

“Oh, they didn’t bother anybody,” said Jack. “But I still feel scared when I think of ghosts.”

“Actually, they didn’t bother anybody, either,” said Annie.

“True,” said Jack. “And neither did that bat.”

Annie laughed. “That’s true, too,” she said. “I feel sad when I think we’ll never see Dipper again.”

“We can listen to his music,” said Jack.

“Yeah… and I guess the music all around us will always make us think of him,” said Annie. “Like right now Dipper would hear the music of the rain.”

“Tappity-tap-tap,” said Jack.

“And the music of our feet scrunching over the dead leaves—” said Annie.

“Scrunchity-scrunch-scrunch,” said Jack.

“Patti-pat-pat!” sang Annie.

“Skid-dat-de-dat!” sang Jack.

“Skid-dat-de-doh!” sang Annie.

“Go, Mama! Go!” shouted Jack.

And the two of them ran out of the Frog Creek woods and up their street, heading for home.



More Facts from Jack and Annie

The city of New Orleans is nestled on the Mississippi River in southern Louisiana. The historic city is a blend of many cultures. Its architecture, food, and music were greatly influenced by a mix of French, Spanish, African, German, and Irish settlers.



In 2005, New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest storms in American history. Much of the city became flooded, and over 1,000 people lost their lives. The city is still rebuilding after the devastating storm.



New Orleans is famous for being the birthplace of jazz music. Jazz bands play in clubs and march frequently in street parades.



The most famous parade of the year happens on Mardi Gras in late winter. On this day many thou sands of tourists and townspeople participate in parties and processions.



Louis Armstrong was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in August 1901 and died in Queens, New York, in July 1971.



His friends and family called him Dipper because he had a fondness as a child for a song called “Dippermouth Blues.”



All the chapter titles in this book are the titles of songs Louis Armstrong recorded early in his career.



A year before he died, Armstrong told a reporter, “I think I had a beautiful life. I didn’t wish for anything that I couldn’t get and I got pretty near everything I wanted because I worked for it.”∗



In Louis Armstrong’s New York Times obituary published on July 18, 1971, his friend and fellow musician Dizzy Gillespie wrote: “Louis is not dead, for his music is and will remain in the hearts and minds of countless millions of the world’s peoples, and in the playing of hundreds of thousands of musicians who have come under his influence. The King is dead. Long live the King.”

CHAPTER ONE


A Beautiful Word


It was a chilly afternoon in late winter. Annie was doing her homework on the computer in the living room. Jack sat on the couch and stared at a blank page in his small notebook. He heaved a sigh.

“What’s wrong?” said Annie.

“I have to write a story for school,” said Jack, “and I’m stuck.”

“Well, you’d better get unstuck,” said Annie. “Mom and Dad said we have to get our homework done before we go to the theater with them tonight.”

“I know,” said Jack. “But I can’t think of anything to write about.”

“Why don’t you do what you love to do?” said Annie. “Go outside and write down some facts about what you see. Then turn them into a story.”

“Hey, that’s a good idea,” said Jack. “Thanks.” He jumped up and grabbed his coat from the hall closet. Then, taking his pencil and notebook with him, he headed outdoors.

The early March weather was sunny but cold and windy. Jack looked around. Then he wrote down some facts in his notebook:

old snow in yard

sun sparkling on sidewalk

Jack looked up again. Treetops swayed in the March winds. Jack started to write about them. But when he looked down at his notebook, he nearly dropped his pencil. On the page were two large, fancy letters:

T K

“Oh, man!” whispered Jack. He dashed back in the house and into the living room. “Annie! Look!” Jack held up his notebook. “Look at this!”

Annie stared at the page. “Old snow … sun sparkling … Nice.…”

“No, not that!” said Jack. “The letters!”

Annie looked at Jack like he was a little crazy. “Uh … what letters?” she said.

Jack looked back at the page. “They’re gone!” he said. “A big, fancy T and K!”

“T and K?” said Annie.

“Yes! For Teddy and Kathleen!” said Jack. “The letters just appeared on the page when I was outside! They were there! Really!”

“I believe you,” said Annie. She jumped up from the computer. “Let’s go.”

“Wait, I have to get my backpack from upstairs,” said Jack.

“Forget it! Come on! The tree house must be waiting for us!” said Annie.

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He quickly shoved his notebook and pencil into a pocket of his coat.

Annie grabbed her jacket. “Mom! Dad! We’re going to take a little break from our homework!” she called.

“Okay, but make it short! We have to leave for the theater by seven!” their dad called from the kitchen.

“We will!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie headed outside. They ran over the melting snow in their front yard and up the sun-sparkling sidewalk. They charged across the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They hurried between the windblown trees until they came to the tallest oak.

High in the branches was the magic tree house. Their friends from Camelot, Teddy and Kathleen, were looking out the window.

“Hello!” called Kathleen.

“Hi!” shouted Annie, waving.

“Good trick with the magic letters!” Jack called.

“We thought you’d like that!” said Teddy. “I just learned how to do it!”

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her. They climbed into the tree house and hugged the young enchanters.

“So what’s up today?” asked Jack.

“Where does Merlin want us to go now?” asked Annie.

“Merlin wants you to go to Galway, Ireland,” said Kathleen.

“Ireland? Cool!” said Annie.

“Morgan sent us to Ireland once before—to the ninth century,” said Jack.

“Yes. Well, this time you will go to Ireland in the nineteenth century,” said Teddy. “To 1862, to be exact. Your mission is to find an imaginative and creative girl named Augusta.”

“Augusta doesn’t know yet what her talents are,” said Kathleen. “She lives in a time when it is not easy for girls to explore their creativity. Your mission will be to inspire her, so she can give her gifts to the world.”

“What does that word mean exactly?” asked Annie. “Inspire?”

“’tis a beautiful word,” said Kathleen, her sea-blue eyes shining. “It means to breathe life into a person’s heart, to make her feel joyful to be alive.”

“That is beautiful,” said Annie.

“You may need some magic to help you,” said Teddy. From the corner of the tree house, he picked up the magic trumpet that had helped them on their last journey. “Only this time …”

Teddy handed the trumpet to Kathleen. She held the shiny brass instrument for a moment. Then she tossed it into the air. The trumpet spun like a whirlwind. There was a flash of blue light—and the trumpet was gone! In its place was a thin silver pipe with six holes.

“What’s that?” breathed Jack.

“An Irish whistle,” said Kathleen. She plucked the instrument from the air. “When you face great danger, one of you must play it. It will make magical music. And anything the other one sings will come true.”

“But remember,” said Teddy, “its magic will work only once.”



“Right,” said Annie.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He took the Irish whistle from Kathleen and put it into his pocket. “And did Morgan send a research book to give us information?”

“Not this time,” said Teddy. “Morgan wants you to draw upon your own experiences in life to help you on this journey.”

“No problem,” said Annie.

Jack wasn’t sure about that. He liked having a book of facts to help them.

“So how do we find Augusta?” said Annie.

“It should be easy to find her,” said Teddy. “When you land in the county of Galway, Ireland, just ask anyone for directions to the Big House.”

“Hold on.” Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

County of Galway, Ireland

Augusta

Big House



“Got it,” said Jack. “But how do we get to Ireland in the first place if we don’t have a research book?”

“Point to the notes you just made and make your wish,” said Kathleen.

“And when you are ready to come home,” said Teddy, “use the Pennsylvania book as you usually do.”

“Got it,” said Jack.

“Go now, and help Augusta,” said Kathleen. “She needs you.”

Jack pointed to the words Galway, Ireland in his notebook. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

“Bye!” Annie said to Teddy and Kathleen.

“Farewell!” said Kathleen.

“Good luck!” said Teddy.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

A few years ago I visited County Galway in Ireland. I traveled through seaside towns along the rocky coast and took a boat out to the lonely Aran Islands at the mouth of Galway Bay. I loved the lush green sheep meadows of the countryside, the smell of peat fires wafting through misty rain, the cozy pubs where we had gingerbread and strong tea. Ever since that visit, I’ve loved Irish music and literature—especially the folklore of leprechauns, fairies, and legendary Irish heroes and heroines.

So now I want to share Ireland with you. Get ready for a journey to the enchanted countryside of Galway, to a time a hundred and fifty years ago, when mysterious creatures still hid in the forests and hills. Be careful not to let them see you, or you might be turned into a skunk or a weasel! But don’t be afraid—just have a great time with Jack and Annie.

“They can grow small or grow large. They can

take what shape they choose.… They go by us in a

cloud of dust; they are as many as the blades of

grass. They are everywhere.”

—from Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland

by Lady Gregory





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie traveled to places both mythical and real to do Merlin’s bidding.

On their most recent missions, Jack and Annie found four secrets of happiness to help Merlin when he was in trouble.

Now Merlin wants Jack and Annie to bring happiness to others—by helping four creative people give their special gifts to the world. They have already helped the first two; now they are ready to find the third.…

“Right,” said Annie.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He took the Irish whistle from Kathleen and put it into his pocket. “And did Morgan send a research book to give us information?”

“Not this time,” said Teddy. “Morgan wants you to draw upon your own experiences in life to help you on this journey.”

“No problem,” said Annie.

Jack wasn’t sure about that. He liked having a book of facts to help them.

“So how do we find Augusta?” said Annie.

“It should be easy to find her,” said Teddy. “When you land in the county of Galway, Ireland, just ask anyone for directions to the Big House.”

“Hold on.” Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

County of Galway, Ireland

Augusta

Big House



“Got it,” said Jack. “But how do we get to Ireland in the first place if we don’t have a research book?”

“Point to the notes you just made and make your wish,” said Kathleen.

“And when you are ready to come home,” said Teddy, “use the Pennsylvania book as you usually do.”

“Got it,” said Jack.

“Go now, and help Augusta,” said Kathleen. “She needs you.”

Jack pointed to the words Galway, Ireland in his notebook. “I wish we could go there!” he said.

“Bye!” Annie said to Teddy and Kathleen.

“Farewell!” said Kathleen.

“Good luck!” said Teddy.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. The Big House


A cold wind blew rain into the tree house. Jack shivered. He was wearing an old overcoat and ragged trousers. Annie wore a scarf, a shawl, and a long red wool dress. They both wore scuffed, worn boots.

“So where are we?” said Jack. He and Annie looked out the window.

The tree house had landed in a tree at the edge of a green meadow dotted with woolly white sheep. Next to the meadow was a narrow lane. It ran uphill between low stone walls. Through the drizzle, Jack could see mist-covered mountains in the distance and a flash of silver sea.

“It looks like a scene in a fairy tale,” said Annie.

“Yeah, a fairy tale with bad weather,” said Jack.

“I wonder where the Big House is,” said Annie.

“I don’t know, but I’d like to get inside it now,” said Jack.

“Me too,” said Annie, shivering. “Let’s go.”

Jack crammed his cold hands into the pockets of his torn coat. In one pocket, he felt his notebook and pencil. In the other, he felt the Irish whistle. “I’ve got the whistle,” he said.

“Good,” said Annie. She held her red skirt and started down the rope ladder. Jack climbed down after her.

Annie pulled her shawl tightly around her shoulders. Jack turned up the collar of his coat. As they tramped through the wet meadow, he felt cold water seeping through holes in his boots.

Jack and Annie climbed over a stone wall onto the muddy lane. A horse-drawn wagon was rattling toward them down the hill. The wagon was filled with squealing pigs.

“Excuse me!” Annie called to the driver. “Can you tell us where the Big House is?”



An old man with a tired, rugged face pointed back up the hill.

“Thanks!” said Jack.

The large wooden wheels of the wagon rumbled past, splashing Jack and Annie with mud.

“Yuck!” said Annie.

“Now we’re cold and wet and dirty,” said Jack.

“Yeah, we’re going to look great when we get to the Big House,” said Annie.

“So what do we do when we get there?” asked Jack.

“When we find Augusta, maybe we tell her that Teddy and Kathleen sent us,” said Annie, “like we told Louis Armstrong in New Orleans.”

Just thinking about their adventure with Louis Armstrong made Jack smile. “I don’t know if that will work,” he said. “His world seemed so different from this world. There it was so noisy and busy. Here it feels lonely.”

“Well, we won’t know until we find Augusta,” said Annie. “Let’s go.”

Jack and Annie lowered their heads. They plodded up the lane, sloshing in and out of giant puddles. When they reached the top of the hill, they stopped. The muddy lane wound down, past more sheep meadows and some cottages, past a long stable and several barns.

At the end of the lane was a large open gate that led onto the grounds of a white mansion. Gray smoke rose from the mansion’s chimneys.

“The Big House!” said Annie.

“Maybe the people who live there will invite us inside to get warm and dry by a fire,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie started down the lane. As they passed the sheep meadows, black-and-white dogs barked at them. When they walked by several boys hauling wet hay, the workers looked up and eyed them suspiciously.

Jack was relieved to get to the gate and head toward the Big House. When they reached the front door, Annie lifted the heavy knocker and let it drop.

A moment later, the door opened. A pale teenage girl looked out. “Who are you? Why are you here?”

“Uh … well …,” started Jack.

“Are you the ones the butler sent for?” the girl asked.

“The butler?” said Jack.

“Yes, we are!” said Annie.

“Then you should go round to the back!” the girl said. Before Jack or Annie could ask for Augusta, the girl slammed the door in their faces.

“Nice,” said Jack.

“I hope she wasn’t Augusta,” said Annie.

“Why did you tell her ‘yes’?” asked Jack.

“It’s a way to get inside the Big House,” said Annie. “Come on.”

Jack and Annie tramped through the mud to the back of the mansion. They stopped at a door beneath a large smoking chimney. Annie knocked again.

This time a young red-haired girl in a cap and apron opened the door. “Yes?” she said.

“Is your name—” started Annie.

“Who is it, Molly?” someone called from inside.

Molly? So she’s not Augusta, thought Jack.

“Who are you?” Molly asked them.

“We’re the ones the butler sent for,” said Annie.

“You?” said Molly. She looked doubtful. “Well, come in and see him then.”

Jack and Annie stepped inside.

“He’s in the kitchen,” said Molly. She started down the hall.

Jack and Annie followed Molly to the doorway of a dimly lit kitchen. The kitchen smelled of fish and onions. Pots and pans hung from a long rack over a big wooden table. A stout older woman was bent over the table, rolling out dough.

“Cook, here are the ones the butler sent for,” said Molly.

The cook looked up from her dough and squinted at Jack and Annie. “You’re the ones he sent for?” she said.

“Uh, yes, ma’am, that’s us,” said Annie.

The cook turned toward the fireplace. Next to the fire an ancient-looking man with white whiskers sat slumped in a chair, snoring. “Mr. O’Leary!”

The old man jerked and opened his eyes.

“The ones you sent for are here!” the cook shouted, as if the man were hard of hearing.

The groggy butler peered at Jack and Annie. “I sent for you?” he growled. “Not possible! I sent for a coach driver and a blacksmith.”

“Really?” said Annie. “I guess there was a mistake. But maybe there are some other jobs we could do around here.”

“Well, what are you good for?” asked the butler.

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“Do you know how to sweep the inside of a chimney?” said the old man.

“Um … no,” said Jack.

“Pluck a chicken?” the cook asked.

“No way,” said Annie.

“What about rats?” the butler said.

“What about them?” asked Jack.

“They’re all over the cellar,” said the cook. “Can you catch ’em?”

“I—I don’t think so,” said Jack.

“Then you’re no good to us here!” snorted the butler. “Be on your way!”

At that moment, Jack heard the back door open and shut. A girl about Jack’s age stepped into the kitchen. She wore a red cape and carried two large, empty baskets. Her wet hair was parted neatly down the middle and pulled into a tight bun in the back.

“Ah!” said the cook. “Welcome back, Miss Augusta!”


3. Miss Augusta


Jack and Annie looked at each other. Augusta!

The girl put down her baskets and took off her wet cape.

“Did you deliver your cakes to the poor, Miss Augusta?” asked Molly.

“Yes, Molly,” said Augusta. “I visited seven cottages today.”

“Seven? In this weather? You’re an angel, Miss Augusta!” said Molly. “Always so kind to the poor.”

“It is my duty, Molly,” the girl said, “to help those less fortunate than myself.” Her gaze rested on Jack and Annie. “And who are these poor children?”

“They’re looking for work, miss,” said the cook. “But I’m afraid they’re sorry creatures, not good for anything. I was just sending them away.”

“Oh, surely we must not turn them out so quickly, Cook,” said Augusta. “How tired and miserable they look.”

Jack didn’t think they looked that bad.

“We are tired and miserable,” Annie said. Her voice sounded sad. Her shoulders sagged.

Oh, brother, Jack thought. Annie was really acting her part.

“My poor dears, you must both come into the parlor and rest a bit,” said Augusta.

“We would like that,” Annie said pitifully.

“Follow me,” said Augusta.

“Miss Augusta, surely you’re not taking those dirty children into the parlor!” said the cook.

“We must always be kind to the poor, Cook, no matter how dirty they are,” said Augusta. “We should give them something to drink if they are thirsty, and something to eat if they are hungry.”

“You are too kind, Miss Augusta,” said Molly, shaking her head.

“Well, at least make them take off their filthy boots,” said the cook.

Jack and Annie pulled off their boots and socks and set them by the door. Their feet were red and raw-looking.

Augusta took two peeled potatoes from a bowl and put them in her pocket. Then she picked up a lit candle from the hearth. “Come, let me take you to the parlor,” she said to Jack and Annie.

“Thanks, Augusta,” said Annie.

“Show some respect!” the cook called after Annie. “Call her ‘Miss Augusta’!”

“Sorry!” said Annie. “Thanks, Miss Augusta.”

Jack rolled his eyes. Why should he call her ‘miss’? Augusta didn’t look like she was any older than he was!

Holding her flickering candle, Augusta led Jack and Annie out of the kitchen. The wooden floor creaked as they walked barefoot through a narrow hallway.

How are we ever going to inspire this strange, serious girl? wondered Jack. She acts as if she’s already a grown-up and treats Annie and me like babies.

“We’ll sit in here, children,” said Augusta. She directed Jack and Annie into a large room with heavy curtains and dark furniture. The pale teenage girl who’d answered the front door sat on a sofa, knitting. Another teenage girl knitted beside her. They scowled when they saw Jack and Annie.

“What are you doing, Augusta?” asked the pale girl. “Why are you bringing those two into the parlor?”

“I invited them to tea, Gertrude,” said Augusta. She turned to Jack and Annie. “Pay no attention to my sisters,” she said. “Please, sit down.”

“Augusta, have you gone mad?” said Gertrude. “You cannot invite these two ragamuffins to sit in here!”

“Mother will be furious,” said Augusta’s other sister. “They’re filthy! They’re not even wearing shoes!”

Jack looked down at his muddy clothes and cold red feet.

“Cook made them remove their muddy shoes in the kitchen, Eliza,” Augusta said. “I only wish I had nice, dry shoes to give them. Sit down, children,” she said to Jack and Annie again.

Jack and Annie slowly sat down.

“You’re going to get into trouble, Augusta …,” said Gertrude.

“Mother will never approve,” said Eliza. Both sisters shook their heads as they went back to their knitting.

Augusta ignored her sisters and walked to a silver teapot on a sideboard. “Would you like some hot tea, my poor dears?” she asked Jack and Annie.

“Yes, Miss Augusta,” said Annie.

Jack nodded. Hot tea sounded good. He still felt chilled from the cold wind and rain. There was a fireplace in the dreary parlor, but no fire was lit. Everything in the room seemed dark and gloomy, except for a few books on a table.

As Augusta poured tea into fancy china cups, Jack leaned closer to get a look at the books. One was titled The Plays of William Shakespeare. Another was called The Tales of King Arthur. Jack smiled to himself. Seeing those book titles made him feel a little more comfortable.

Augusta carried cups of tea to Jack and Annie. Then she pulled the potatoes out of her pocket and gave one to each of them.

“Thank you, Miss Augusta,” said Annie.

Jack took a sip of tea, but it was too bitter and hot to drink. He took a bite of his cold potato, but it was too hard to chew.



“So, Miss Augusta, what do you like to do around here?” Annie asked. “What inspires you?”

Augusta looked puzzled. “I do not know what you mean,” she said.

“What about reading books?” said Jack. “Have you read those books?” He pointed to The Tales of King Arthur and The Plays of William Shakespeare.

“Those books belong to my brothers,” said Augusta.

“The time has not come for Augusta to read such books,” said her sister Gertrude.

“Not until she is older,” said her sister Eliza.

“Why?” asked Jack.

“Mother says The Tales of King Arthur and the plays of Shakespeare are not for young ladies,” said Augusta.

“Really?” said Jack.

“Yes. But I’m afraid I sometimes peek at my brothers’ books,” Augusta said to Jack and Annie in a low voice. “I love stories. I remember every story I read or hear.”

“I love stories, too,” said Annie. “And I love books.”

The two older sisters smiled. “Keep striving, my dear,” said Eliza. “Perhaps one day you will learn to read.”

“I already know how to read,” said Annie. “Jack and I read lots of books.” She pointed to the books on the table. “In fact, we know tons about King Arthur, and we go see plays by Shakespeare with our parents. And one time, we even acted in a play by Shakespeare—A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”

“It was at our school,” Jack broke in, before Annie could tell them that she and Jack had actually met Shakespeare himself!

“A Midsummer Night’s Dream?” said Augusta. She looked surprised.

“Don’t listen to them, Augusta,” said Gertrude. “I doubt these children have ever been to school—much less acted in a play by William Shakespeare.”

“I suspect you are quite right, Gertrude,” someone said.

A tall woman was standing in the doorway of the parlor. She wore a long black velvet dress and stood very straight. There was an icy look on her face as she stared at Jack and Annie.

“Oh! Mother!” said Eliza.


4. What Are You Good For?


“Hi there!” Annie said cheerfully.

Augusta’s mother did not reply. She was staring at Jack’s bare feet. Her expression made him sink down in his chair.

“Do not blame Eliza or me, Mother,” said Gertrude. “These are Augusta’s friends, not ours.”

“I took pity on them, Mother,” said Augusta. “They were wet and miserable.”

Her mother finally smiled. “Yes, daughter, I imagine they were. It’s very nice to have pity for the poor, but dirty children should not be sitting in our parlor.”

“They were hungry, Mother,” said Augusta.

“Yes, and I see you have given them food,” said her mother. “So it is time to take them out of the house now.”

Jack and Annie stood up. Jack was happy to leave. He felt like Augusta and her mother were talking about stray dogs or cats.

But Augusta sat very still and just stared at her mother.

“Go on—get them out of here, Augusta,” said Gertrude. “They are not clean! They might even have bugs in their hair.”

The mere mention of bugs made Jack’s scalp itch. He and Annie both scratched their heads.

“See!” said Gertrude.

“Augusta …,” her mother said in a stern voice.

“Oh, all right! All right!” said Augusta, standing up. “I was trying to be kind! Come with me, please,” she said to Jack and Annie. “I’ll lead you down the lane a bit, at least past the sheepdogs.”

As Augusta started out of the room, her mother stopped her and pinched her shoulders. “Carry yourself straight, daughter,” she said.

Jack couldn’t imagine how the girl could carry herself any straighter.

Augusta led Jack and Annie back down the dark hallway, through the fish-smelling kitchen, past the ancient butler sleeping by the fire and the three kitchen maids and the cook. Without a word, she grabbed her red cape and pulled it around her.

“Where are you going, Miss Augusta?” asked Molly.

“I have been ordered to send these poor children back out into the storm,” Augusta said.

Jack and Annie forced their feet into their stiff, wet socks and boots. Augusta held the door for them, then followed them outside, slamming the door shut behind her.

Even though it was still rainy and windy, Jack felt much happier outside the Big House than inside it. He and Annie followed Augusta past the gates and out to the lane. Augusta walked stiffly, leading them like a mother duck.

“What are we going to do about her?” Annie whispered to Jack.

“I don’t know,” whispered Jack. “She doesn’t seem very creative or imaginative to me.”

“Well, we have to inspire her! Come on!” said Annie. She and Jack hurried to catch up with Augusta.



“Miss Augusta!” said Annie, walking alongside her. “Do you like to sing? Dance? Paint? Play a musical instrument? Anything creative like that?”

“No,” said Augusta. She sounded angry. Jack figured she must be mad at her mother for kicking them out of the Big House.

“Well, what about nature?” said Annie.

“What about it?” asked Augusta.

“Walking in the woods?” said Annie. “Trees? Birds? Does anything like that inspire you?”

“Not anymore. I was close to nature once,” Augusta said. “I used to roam the woods with my younger brothers. They said I was like a robin with the eye of a hawk. I knew where to find the caves of the otters. I knew where to find the nests of wild birds.”

“That’s so cool,” said Annie.

“I knew where the deer lay down to sleep,” said Augusta. “I knew the names of every tree: oak, beech, elm, hazel, larch, pine.…” Augusta’s voice grew a little wobbly, as if she might cry. “But I’m not allowed to roam the woods with my brothers anymore. Mother says it’s not proper for a young lady.”

“That’s so sad!” said Annie.

“Never mind,” said Augusta, lifting her chin. “Let us not talk about me anymore. Let us try instead to help the two of you. Cook said you were not good for anything. Why would she say that?”

“They asked us if we were good for cleaning chimneys, plucking chickens, or catching rats,” said Annie, “and we said no.”

“Then you must find other ways to make yourselves useful,” said Augusta, “or you will never find your way in the world. Can you shear sheep?”

“We’ve never tried it,” said Jack.

“Milk cows? Churn butter? Weave a shawl?” Augusta asked impatiently. “Hunt rabbits with hounds?”

“Oh, never that!” said Annie. Jack laughed.

Augusta frowned. “This is nothing to laugh about. Every day, you must ask yourselves: what am I good for?”

Actually, that was a good question, Jack thought. What was he good for?

“And I would like to give you a further piece of advice,” said Augusta. “Never make up stories about yourselves that aren’t true.”

“What do you mean?” said Jack.

“You never acted in a play of Shakespeare’s, did you? Tell the truth now,” said Augusta.

“We did,” said Jack. “My sister was telling the truth. We were both in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”

“We played wood fairies,” said Annie. “We had green costumes, and Jack gave a little speech and I danced and sang.”

Augusta shook her head. “You poor dears,” she said. “I know you only make up these wild stories because your real lives are so miserable, but—”

“Wait a minute. Stop,” said Jack. “What’s wrong with you? Why do you act so snobby?”

“Snobby? Me?” Augusta looked confused.

“Jack—” said Annie.

“No, I’m serious,” Jack said to Annie. “She thinks she’s better than us.”

“No, I don’t!” Augusta said, stunned. “I’m not like that at all! Each day I walk several miles to town to give cakes and clothes to poor children like yourselves.”

“That’s nice,” said Jack. “But you think you’re better than those poor children, don’t you? You’d never want to be real friends with them, would you?”

“What you say about me is not true!” Augusta said to Jack. “I love the poor! Why, my favorite friend in all the world is quite poor and has never been to school. Some say she’s even a little cracked in the head, but I love her dearly!”

“Who’s that?” asked Annie.

“Mary! Mary Sheridan, our old nursemaid,” said Augusta. “I’ll take you to meet her. Mary will tell you the truth about me! Come along!”

Augusta ran from the lane and across the muddy grass, her red cape flying in the wind.

“Um … I don’t think you inspired her,” Annie said.

“I know, I’m sorry,” said Jack. “I just couldn’t take her attitude any longer.”

“Well, get over it,” said Annie. “We’re supposed to help her, not annoy her.”

“She was annoying me!” said Jack.

“Yeah, I know,” said Annie. “Me too. But we’ve got a mission. Come on.”

Jack and Annie followed Augusta across the grass to a small white cottage with a straw roof. Augusta banged on the door, scaring away birds eating crumbs by the front steps. “Mary! Mary! It’s me, Augusta!” she called.

“Come in, my dear,” a voice answered.

Augusta lifted the latch and led Jack and Annie inside.

Wrapped in a brown shawl, Mary Sheridan was stroking an orange cat by an open fire. She had ragged white hair and bright blue eyes. Her crooked smile revealed a few missing teeth.

“One and twenty welcomes on this wonderful winter day!” said the old woman.


5. A Fireside Tale


“Hello, Mary!” said Augusta. She kissed the old woman on her wrinkled cheek.

With the firelight on her face, Mary seemed to glow. Her warm, snug cottage was the opposite of the Big House. It smelled of damp leaves and moss, bread and chocolate. Firelight danced on the earthen floor and stone walls. Rain dripped through the roof, pinging into a couple of tin buckets.

“And who do we have here, Miss Augusta?” Mary asked.

“Two poor children from town,” said Augusta. “I want you to tell them about me—how I truly love the poor and try to help them.”

Mary smiled. “Please, sit down first,” she said.

Jack, Annie, and Augusta sat down on three rickety wooden chairs.

“Would you children like some hot cocoa?” Mary asked.

Jack and Annie nodded eagerly.

“Yes, please, Mary,” said Augusta. “But would you tell them—”

“Yes, I will tell them all about you,” said Mary. She picked up a pot sitting on the hearth. She poured steaming cocoa into three mugs and handed them to Jack, Annie, and Augusta.

The cocoa smelled delicious. Jack took a sip and licked his lips. “Yum,” he said. His insides felt warm for the first time all day.

“Now, Mary?” asked Augusta.

“In time, my child,” Mary said to Augusta. “Tell me, what have you been doing today?”

“I delivered cakes in town,” Augusta said proudly. “Then I found these poor children in our kitchen looking for work. I’ve tried to help them. But they say I am snobby. I brought them here so you could tell them the truth about me.”

“Ah, I see, Miss Augusta. How did you try to help them?” said Mary.

“I’ve tried to discover what they are good for,” said Augusta. “But it appears they are good for nothing.”

“Really?” Mary fixed her twinkling eyes on Jack and Annie. “Well, let us start with this, children: tell me something you like to do. No, wait—what do you love to do?”

“Uh … well, I love to read,” said Jack.

“And write,” said Annie.

“Read and write?” said Augusta. “I don’t think so.”

Mary ignored Augusta and kept looking at Jack and Annie. “What do you like to read and write?” asked Mary.

“Facts mostly,” said Jack. “True stories.”

“Jack writes facts down all the time,” said Annie.

“Honestly, Mary,” said Augusta. “Soon they’ll be telling you that they are actors, too—and have performed in a play by William Shakespeare. Can we talk about me now?”

“Actually, that’s true,” Jack said to Mary. “We were in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Annie and I were fairies. I had stage fright, but Will—”

“William Shakespeare himself,” said Annie.

“He helped me get over it,” said Jack. He looked straight at Augusta.

Augusta rolled her eyes.

“Will was so nice,” said Annie.

“And smart,” said Jack.

“Of course he was!” said Mary. “You can tell that from his stories.”

“Oh, please stop. Don’t tell Mary those ridiculous things!” Augusta said. “What about me, Mary?”

“Wait, child, I have a question for them,” Mary said. She leaned forward and spoke in a whisper. “Where is summer? Can you answer me that?”

Mary’s question doesn’t make sense, Jack thought.



“I don’t know. Do you know where summer is, Mary?” asked Annie.

“Summer is hiding with the Shee!” said Mary, laughing.

“The Shee? What’s that?” said Annie.

“Surely, you must know the Shee,” said Mary. “That’s what we Irish call our fairies. In the winter, the Shee steal all the warmth and sunshine, leaving us to suffer with the cold and rain!”

Annie laughed, too.

“So you’ve played the parts of fairies in a play by Shakespeare?” said Mary. “They’re just like our Shee. Have you seen the Shee here in Ireland?”

“Mary!” Augusta said impatiently.

“Not yet,” said Annie.

“That’s a shame,” said Mary. “I have seen them. This is a true story”—she looked at Jack and smiled—“with facts. You might want to write them down.”

“Oh. Sure,” said Jack. He pulled his notebook and pencil out of his pocket. Augusta looked surprised.

Mary leaned close to Jack and Annie again. Her eyes were shining and her voice was hushed. “One day long ago, a lonely young girl took a walk in an old forest,” said Mary. “All was still, until joyful music began coming from a hidden world.…”

Jack loved Mary’s way of telling a story. He wrote down:

old forest, all still

joyful music, hidden world



Augusta frowned. “So, I guess you can write,” she muttered.

“Suddenly there came a spinning wind,” said Mary, “and a cloud so bright, and a beam of light poured over a river!”

Jack quickly wrote:

spinning wind, bright cloud beam of light, river



“Then they came, rumbling and thundering!” exclaimed Mary.

“Mary,” said Augusta. She sounded impatient.

But Mary kept talking. “Some with wings, some on horses of white! Queens and kings! In robes and gowns the colors of summer, fall, winter, and spring!” Jack wrote:

some with wings

white horses

queens, kings

“They galloped in a circle, a blinding swirl!” said Mary. “They swept up that lonely girl and carried her across the river to their secret hollow hill! Had she gone inside, she would have become very small and seen many wondrous sights!”

Jack wrote:

take lonely girl

hollow hill of Shee

wondrous sights



Jack looked up from his notebook, waiting for Mary to go on. When she spoke again, her voice was very soft. “But the girl grew afraid and ran home instead.”

Mary sat back in her chair and closed her eyes. The only sound in the cottage was the crackling of the fire and the pinging of rain into the tin buckets.

“Mary?” Annie said softly. “Are you the girl in the story?”

Mary opened her eyes. “I will never tell,” she said.

“Oh, Mary,” said Augusta, “such tales!” She turned to Jack and Annie. “Mary still believes in the impossible.”

“Aye, I do, I surely do,” said Mary. “Every night I leave a bit of milk on my windowsill for the Shee. I leave crumbs at my door. They eat them, too.”

“Mary, the birds eat the crumbs!” said Augusta.

“Yes, the birds are hungry also,” said Mary. “But the Shee pick over the crumbs first! At twilight, they steal across the river from their hidden hollow hills. Just ask the old fishermen of County Galway. Ask the farmers and nursemaids.”

Augusta shook her head sadly. “Mary, only simple-minded folk still believe in such things,” she said. “Educated people know what is true and what is not true.”

“No, child,” said Mary. “They only know what they think is true.…”

Augusta straightened her shoulders. “Well. We should be going now, Mary,” she said. “So could you please tell these children the truth about me now?”

“Yes,” said Mary. She turned to Jack and Annie. “Do you children have names?”

Jack smiled. This was the first time today anyone had asked them their names.

“Yes. Our names are Jack and Annie,” said Annie.

“Well, Jack and Annie, thank you for coming to visit me today. I can tell that you are very special,” said Mary.

“What about me, Mary?” Augusta asked. “Am I special?”

“Yes, child, you are,” said Mary. She turned to Jack and Annie. “Augusta is special, too, but in a different way.”

“How am I different, Mary?” asked Augusta.

“You try very, very hard to be good, and you are very smart. But you—” Mary stopped.

“What, Mary? I—what?” said Augusta.

“You are not happy,” said Mary. “And that breaks my heart.”

Augusta’s eyes filled with tears.

“Oh, Augusta, don’t cry,” said Annie. She reached out to take Augusta’s hand, but the girl stepped back.

Augusta wiped her eyes. “That’s silly. I’m happy enough. I know I’ve never seen the Shee and I never will. But I don’t care anymore. And if you like these miserable children more than me, Mary—well, that’s fine!”

Augusta ran to the door and opened it. The damp air swept inside as she rushed out of the cottage. Through the open doorway, Jack and Annie could see Augusta’s red cape flying behind her.


6. A Late–Winter’s Daydream


Jack sighed. Their mission really seemed hopeless now.

“We’d better go find her,” said Annie.

“She won’t go far,” said Mary. “My poor Augusta … she has a fine mind and a brave heart. But she is so unhappy.”

“Why is she so unhappy, Mary?” asked Annie.

“Yeah, what is her problem?” said Jack.

“More than any of her brothers and sisters, Miss Augusta loved my stories,” said Mary. “Remembered every one of them, she did.”

“Really?” said Jack.

“Yes, she would repeat them back to me, word for word,” said Mary.

“That’s amazing,” said Annie.

“She loved the stories so much that she grew desperate to see the Shee for herself,” said Mary. “At night she would carry a lantern across the fields, calling for them. By day, she poked and prodded every part of the farm. Why, she even used a magnifying glass, scouring the earth for tiny footprints! But I’m afraid she never found them.”

“Why?” said Annie.

Mary sighed. “Because she looked for them with her head and not her heart,” she said. “Eventually she gave up and stopped searching. She didn’t even want to hear the stories anymore. She’s been a dutiful—but sorrowful—child ever since.”

“That’s terrible,” said Annie. “What can we do to help her?”

“There is only one thing you can do,” said Mary.

“What?” breathed Jack.

Mary leaned forward in her chair. Her blue eyes seemed to stare right through Jack and Annie. “You must show her the magic,” she said.

What? thought Jack. Does Mary know about the magic tree house? “What do you mean?” he asked.

“I know that you children are like me—you see things that others don’t,” said Mary. “Help Augusta see them, too. Help her find the magic in the fields and in the forest.”

For a moment, Jack and Annie didn’t say anything. The wind blew through the open door. The fire crackled.

Then Annie took a deep breath. “Okay,” she said. “We know exactly what to do.”

“We do?” said Jack.

“Yep, we’ll talk about it outside,” said Annie. “Thanks, Mary. We’ll find Augusta and take care of everything.”

Jack and Annie stood up to go.

“One and twenty fare-thee-wells on this wonderful winter day,” said Mary.

“One and twenty to you, too,” said Jack. Then he and Annie left the cozy cottage, scattering the winter birds by the front door.

It had warmed up a little outside. The rain had stopped, but fog hung heavily over the sheep fields. The ground was soggy with mud.

Jack could barely make out Augusta’s red cape through the fog. She was across the lane, sitting on a stone wall at the edge of the sheep meadow. “Mary was right, she didn’t go far,” Jack said. “So how do we show her the magic, Annie?”

“Easy,” said Annie. “We play our magic whistle.”

“No, we can’t do that,” said Jack. “We’re supposed to save the whistle for a moment of great danger.”

“That moment is now!” said Annie. “Come on.”

“Hold on,” said Jack. “What great danger are we facing right now?”

“Not us. Augusta,” said Annie. “She faces the great danger of losing all hope and happiness and being bored and sad for the rest of her life—and never being inspired and never sharing her gifts with the world! It’s almost too late already!”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. “But are we just going to go up to her and start blowing the whistle and singing? That seems pretty weird.”

“Hmm … yeah, it does,” said Annie.

“How about this?” said Jack. “We’ll tell Augusta that we want to put on a play for her.”

“A play?” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. “We can tell her we want to prove that we weren’t lying, that we really were in a play by Shakespeare.”

“Oh, cool,” said Annie. “Then what?”

“We play the magic whistle,” said Jack. “We sing about the Shee. We make them appear—like in Mary’s story—galloping and thundering! Augusta sees them. She gets inspired. Our mission’s done.”

“Perfect!” said Annie. “Let’s go!”

Jack and Annie hurried across the lane to the stone wall. “Excuse us, Miss Augusta,” said Annie. “We just had a really great idea! Want to hear it?”

Augusta didn’t answer. She kept staring at the ground.

“How would you like to see a play?” said Jack.

Augusta looked up. “A play?” she said.

“We want to put on our own play for you,” said Annie.

“Why?” said Augusta.

“Because it’s really good,” said Jack. “And maybe it will prove to you that we really were in a play by Shakespeare.”

Augusta looked doubtful.

“Come on, you’ll love it,” said Annie. “Do you know a quiet spot where no one can bother us?”

Augusta bit her lip and looked around. Then she stood up. “All right,” she said. “The river near the old forest. I used to go there with my brothers.”

“Great!” said Annie.

Annie and Jack followed Augusta through the rain-soaked, misty meadow. They walked past grazing sheep, then down a slope toward a wide, rushing river. The river separated the sheep’s meadow from an old forest. Jack could barely see the trees through the ghostly fog.

Augusta stopped on a low ridge above the riverbank, near some large rocks. “Here,” she said.

“Good, those rocks can be our stage,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie climbed the pile of small boulders and stood on a large, flat rock.

“Okay,” said Annie. “The name of this play is A Late-Winter’s Daydream.”

Not bad, thought Jack.

“And this is what’s going to happen,” said Annie. “Jack will be the narrator. I’ll play the Irish whistle. And Jack will sing a song that tells the story.”

“What?” said Jack. “Excuse us a minute, Augusta.” Jack turned to Annie. “Why me sing?” he whispered. “Why not I play and you sing?”

“No, I want to play,” said Annie. “You took notes at Mary’s, right? So just say a few words to describe the scene. Then use your notes about the Shee to make up a song. You can do that, can’t you?”

“I guess …,” said Jack.

“Cool,” said Annie. “Give me the whistle.”

Jack reached into his pockets and pulled out his notebook and the Irish whistle. He gave the whistle to Annie.

“Sorry, Miss Augusta,” said Annie. “We’re almost ready.” She whispered directions to Jack. “Okay. Say your introduction. I’ll start to play. Then you’ll start to sing. Then—”

“I’ve got it,” said Jack. “Let’s just start.”

Jack and Annie turned to face Augusta. Jack cleared his throat. Then he spoke in a loud voice:

All is still in an old forest—

until music sounds from a hidden world.…



Jack nodded to Annie.

Annie raised the magic Irish whistle to her lips and began to play.

Strange, sweet music came from the whistle. The music was both sad and happy. It was full of beauty and hope, pain and sorrow. Like the fog over the river, the music seemed to blend everything together.

For a moment, the whistle music was so powerful that Jack couldn’t sing. He felt like crying and laughing at the same time. Finally he looked down at his notes and began to sing:

In the spinning of light—

in a cloud, like a dream,

a bridge appeared over

a wide, flowing stream.



Jack surprised himself. He thought his words for the song sounded pretty good.

A long, fluttering high note burst from Annie’s whistle. Bright, dancing light flowed across the river. The light arched through the fog toward Jack, Annie, and Augusta.

Augusta gasped. Jack looked back down at his notes and sang:

Some came on horses,

some came with wings.

From an enchanted world

little queens, little kings!



The wind began to blow. Jack looked up. Leaves and grass and twigs were flying everywhere.

The whistle music grew wilder.

Thundering and rumbling sounds came from the old forest. A herd of very small white horses galloped out of the mist. On their backs were proud and lovely riders—men in gold helmets, women with long hair floating on the wind. Their capes and gowns were the colors of nature—the pale rose of a spring dawn, the green of summer hummingbirds, the blue of winter twilight, and the gold of autumn oak leaves.

“The Shee!” cried Augusta.



7. Willy

Hundreds of Shee swarmed over the bright bridge. Behind the galloping riders more Shee came fluttering on wings like butterflies.

Augusta stood up as if in a trance, her hands clasped over her heart.

“Oh, wow!” breathed Annie.

“Keep playing!” shouted Jack.

Annie blew into the whistle again.

The Shee flew and galloped along the wide, grassy bank. Their horses, fleet as the wind, had arched necks and flaming eyes. They moved faster and faster, swirling into a blinding circle of light and color.

The soaring sounds of the music inspired Jack to soar with his words, too. He looked at his notebook and sang:

In a swirl they leave,

so wild, so free,

with a lonely girl

to the hill of the Shee!

“Jack, no!” shouted Annie.

A mighty blast of wind nearly blew Jack and Annie off their rock. They crouched down and covered their heads. When the wind grew calm, they stood up—just in time to see the swirling cloud of light vanish back into the old forest.

The Shee were gone. Once again, sky blended with water and earth in a veil of silver mist.

“Whew,” Jack said breathlessly. “That was amazing!”

“Jack! Do you know what you just did?”

“Yeah, I made the Shee appear and disappear,” Jack said. “I used my notes from Mary’s story, just like we planned.”

“Yes, you did that,” said Annie. “And you made Augusta disappear, too!”

“What?” said Jack.

“The Shee took Augusta!” said Annie. “I tried to stop you, but it was too late! You’d already sung those words—”

“What words?” said Jack.

“You sang: In a swirl they leave, so wild, so free, with a lonely girl to the hill of the Shee!” said Annie.

“I was just reading from my notes!” said Jack. “They took Augusta? Are you sure?”

“Yes! She’s gone!” said Annie.

“Oh, no!” said Jack. He and Annie ran to the ridge above the river. “Augusta!” he shouted.

There was no sign of Augusta’s red cape anywhere.

“See? She’s gone,” said Annie.

“It’s all my fault!” said Jack.

“You couldn’t help yourself,” said Annie.

“But I’m responsible!” said Jack. “We have to get her back!”

“Maybe Mary can help us,” said Annie. “She—”

“Wait, listen,” said Jack. “What’s that sound?”

Squeaky noises were coming from behind the pile of small boulders. It sounded as if someone was trying to play the magic whistle. But the sound was definitely not magical.

“The whistle! I must’ve dropped it!” said Annie.

“Maybe it’s Augusta!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran back and looked over the rocks.

A man no higher than Jack’s knee was blowing into the whistle. The man wore a green jacket and a three-cornered red cap with a white feather. He had big ears, a bushy red beard, skinny little legs, and silver buckles on his shoes.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

“A leprechaun!” whispered Annie.

Jack and Annie just stared at the leprechaun as he blew into the whistle. His small, bony fingers danced over its six holes. But only squeaks, chirps, and hollow tweeting sounds came out.

The leprechaun blew harder and harder. Then he stopped. He turned the whistle over and looked at it closely. He shook his head and frowned.

“Hello!” said Annie.

The leprechaun jumped and looked up. “Well, hello yourself!” he said, grinning. “You startled me! Here, take this back. It’s no use to me, as you can plainly hear.”

The little man held up the whistle. Jack reached over the rock and took it. He slipped it back into the pocket of his coat.

“Listen, we need your help,” said Jack. “Our friend—”



“Oh, you humans! Always in such a hurry!” the leprechaun said.

“Sorry,” said Jack, “but we really need you to help us. You see—”

“First of all, who are you?” the leprechaun asked.

“I’m Jack. She’s my sister, Annie,” said Jack. “Our friend—”

“Ah, well then, Jack and sister Annie, I’m Willy,” said the leprechaun. “Now, let’s get a few things straight right away—never call me Little Willy or Tiny Willy. I don’t like it. And never, ever call me Wee Willy. That’s the one I hate the most.”

“Okay, fine!” said Jack. “But—”

“Jack, let me handle this,” said Annie. She turned to the leprechaun. “Willy, why didn’t you go back over the river with the Shee?”

“Ask me why I came over the river in the first place, and I’ll tell you the answers to both questions,” said Willy.

“Okay, why did you come over the river in the first place, Willy? And why didn’t you go back across with the Shee?” said Annie.

“Answer number one: I was having a bit of a nap in the reeds when I heard your whistle playing,” said Willy. “Before I knew it, I was moving with the Shee across the bridge. Probably you didn’t see me. Lost in the swirl of things, I was.”

“Excuse me—” started Jack.

“I’ve heard some good whistle playing,” Willy said. “But yours, missy, was like none I’ve ever heard from a human—not in the nine hundred years of my life. So! Answer number two: I didn’t go back over the river because I wanted to find out the secret of your playing. Well?”

“That’s easy,” said Annie. “The whistle played itself. It wasn’t me.”

“Ah, you’re a modest girl,” said Willy. “And you like to keep the secrets of your talents to yourself.”

“Not really—” said Annie.

“Listen, Willy!” Jack broke in. “Can you help us? We lost our friend, Augusta. It was my fault. I sang about a lonely girl. Then she was taken by the Shee—”

“Yes, I saw that,” said Willy. “Whisked away, she was. So I’m guessing now you want me to help you find her. Is that it?”

“Yes! That’s it!” said Jack.

“We were going to ask Mary Sheridan to help us,” said Annie. “But you probably know the way better. And—”

“Wait a minute,” said Willy. “Did you say Mary Sheridan?”

“You know Mary?” said Annie.

“Know her?” said Willy, grinning from ear to ear. “Why, if I were four feet taller, I’d have married Mary Sheridan years ago.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“Oh, yes, indeed, we’re very good friends,” said Willy. “You see, I live in what you might call the In-between. I have one foot in the magical world of the Shee. And I have one foot in the mortal world of humans, like Mary. Ah, lovely Mary …”

“Yeah, Mary’s great,” said Jack. “But now—”

“You want me to guide you to your missing friend,” said Willy.

“Right, right!” said Jack.

“I can do that, but what will you give me for it?” said Willy.

“What do you mean?” asked Jack.

“What will you give me for helping you find your friend? My time’s very valuable, you know,” said Willy.

“We don’t really have anything,” said Jack.

“We’re poor and miserable,” said Annie.

“I can see that,” said Willy. “All right then, how about this: I’ll lead you to your friend, and you’ll teach me how to play the whistle the way you play it. Fair enough?”

“Sorry, I—” said Annie.

“Deal!” Jack broke in.

“Jack?” said Annie.

“Annie, it’s a deal,” Jack said. He was ready to promise anything to save Augusta!

“Good!” said Willy. “I’d love to play like that for Mary someday. Now, the path I’m about to show you is very, very secret. You must never show another living soul.”

“Of course not,” said Jack.

“Then come with me,” said Willy, “and I’ll lead you across the water to the home of the Shee!”



8. The Hollow Hill

The leprechaun scrambled down the steep bank of the river.

Jack started to follow, but Annie grabbed him. “Jack, the whistle won’t work for Willy!” she said.

“I know,” said Jack. “We’ll worry about that later. Right now, we just have to save Augusta! Come on!”

Jack and Annie hurried after Willy to the wide, rushing river.

“How do we get across?” Jack asked.

“Follow me along the river,” said Willy, “and I’ll show you. Step lightly.”

Willy skipped ahead of them along the riverbank. Jack and Annie followed. Jack tried to step lightly, but it was impossible. Slopping through the mud, his boots filled with ooze and made squishing sounds with every step.

The river grew narrower and narrower, twisting and turning like a snake. The mist grew thicker, until Jack could hardly see a thing. He bumped into Willy, almost knocking him over.

“Careful, laddie!” said the leprechaun.

“Sorry,” said Jack.

“All right,” said Willy. “Here’s where we cross. Hop from stone to stone after me.” Willy disappeared into the mist, crossing the river. Annie followed him.

Jack started across, too. He tried to hop carefully from stone to stone, but the stones were slippery. On his third hop, his boot slid off a mossy rock, and he splashed into the freezing water!

“Jack, are you okay?” Annie called in a loud whisper.

“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine!” Jack said. He scrambled up. His clothes were soaked and heavy. He really was miserable now. He waded to the other side of the river and joined Annie and Willy.

“Ah, you fell in,” said Willy. “That happens sometimes. Come with me now, into the forest.”

Jack, Annie, and Willy walked under the trees. They passed old oaks and maples that creaked in the wind. Jack shivered in his soaking wet clothes.

A big black crow called from a high, bare branch.

Willy jumped, then laughed. “Ah, ’tis probably Patrick Daly,” he said. “Rumor is the Shee changed him into a crow for stealing a pair of the High Queen’s shoes.”

“Changed him into a crow?” said Jack.

Willy nodded. “One of the Shee’s favorite tricks,” he said, “changing humans who displease them into animals.”

“Oh,” said Jack.

A white rabbit scampered through the forest. “That bunny over there is no doubt the former Mrs. Shan McCartie. She was rude to the High King,” said Willy.



“Rude to the High King?” said Jack. He was starting to feel like he was trapped in a nightmare.

“The Shee cannot bear the rudeness of humans,” said Willy. “Look there.” He pointed to a fawn peeking out from behind a fir tree.

“Aww, it’s so cute,” said Annie.

“Cute? Maybe. Maybe not,” said Willy. “Could easily be old John Foley. I heard he was changed just for being a grouch! Come along.”

Willy led Jack and Annie through the forest until they came to a tangle of briars and brambles. “The hollow hill of the Shee lies just beyond this thicket,” he said to them. “Do you still want to go and find your friend?”

“Yes,” Jack and Annie both whispered.

“Then off you go, and good luck to you,” said Willy, tipping his hat.

“What? Aren’t you coming with us?” said Jack.

“Oh, my, no,” said Willy. “The Shee would be furious if they knew I’d shown humans the path to their secret hiding place. And I certainly don’t want to live the rest of my life as a weasel.”

“But won’t they be angry at us for finding their secret hiding place?” said Jack.

“Possibly,” said Willy. “Here’s what I recommend you do: politely tell the High King and the High Queen that you’ve just come looking for your dear friend to take her back to her loving family. The Shee place very great value on friendship and family.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “Friendship and family …”

“And remember: be simple, direct, and honest at all times,” said Willy.

“Simple, direct, honest,” repeated Jack.

“And polite, that’s the most important—very, very polite,” said Willy.

“Very polite,” said Annie. “Got it.”

“Another thing,” said Willy. “In the world of the Shee, the old tales still live. So do not be afraid if you see odd sights floating about. They’re just bits and pieces of the old stories. Now go. Be simple, direct, honest, and polite, and save your dear friend before she’s lost forever.”

“Thanks, Willy,” said Annie.

“Best of luck,” said Willy.

“See you later,” said Jack.

“Aye, I’ll be waiting for you,” said the leprechaun.

Jack and Annie crouched down and started through the thicket. Thorns and briars pulled at Jack’s wet coat. They scratched his hands and got caught in his hair.

Jack battled his way through the tangled brush until he caught up with Annie. They both pushed their way out of the thicket and stepped into a glade.

“Wow, it’s like Mary said,” whispered Annie. “It is like summer here.”

No rain fell. No wind blew. Warm sunshine shone on the emerald-green glade. In the middle of the glade was a large grassy mound. At the foot of the mound was a small doorway framed by stones.

“That must be it—the hollow hill,” said Jack, “the secret home of the Shee.”

“And that must be someone from an old story,” whispered Annie. She pointed to a woman floating above the green mound.

The woman wore a wreath of flowers on her head and carried a branch with silver apples. She vanished in the sunny haze.

“Whoa,” whispered Jack.

A small sailing ship then appeared in the air. It had white sails and flags flying. The ship, too, vanished. Then an old woman spinning at a spinning wheel appeared … then a wispy dragon … then a knight with a sword. The parade of images faded into the sunshine like wisps of smoke.

“Whew,” said Jack.

“Listen,” said Annie.

The sound of drumming was coming from the doorway of the grassy mound. “Come on, let’s look inside,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie snuck close to the small doorway. It was no higher than Jack’s waist. He and Annie knelt down and peeked inside.

The hollow hill was filled with a pale-green light. Very small dancers, none more than eight inches tall, were bathed in the light. As drummers pounded tiny drums, the dancers danced together in rows. They held their arms straight by their sides and kicked their legs and turned around and around to the rhythm of the drums.

A small shining couple sat on high golden chairs watching the dancers. They wore golden crowns.

“They must be the High King and the High Queen,” whispered Annie.

Jack and Annie watched until the rows of dancers parted. Then they could see a third person watching the dance. She was no taller than the dancers. Draped around her shoulders was a red cape.

“It’s Augusta!” said Annie.



9. Skunks or Weasels?

“Augusta!” whispered Jack. “She’s—she’s tiny!”

“They must have shrunk her!” whispered Annie.

“Hide!” whispered Jack. He crawled away from the door. Annie crawled after him. They pressed their backs against the grassy mound.

“Why are we hiding?” asked Annie.

“We can’t let them see us!” said Jack. “They might shrink us, too!”

“But how are we going to save Augusta?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Hey, I just remembered something,” said Annie. “Didn’t Mary say the girl in her story would have become small if she’d gone inside the hollow hill?”

“Yeah, she did,” said Jack. “So maybe that means you can only get shrunk if you go inside.”

“Right,” said Annie. “So let’s go back to the doorway and call from outside. We’ll be simple, direct, honest, and very polite, like Willy said. We’ll tell the king and queen we’ve come to take our friend back to her family.”

“But wait a minute,” said Jack. “How can she go back to normal life with her family if she’s only eight inches tall?”

“Good point,” said Annie.

“This is so weird,” said Jack.

“Let’s worry about her size later,” said Annie. “For now, we just have to help her escape.”

“Right,” said Jack. “Let’s try it.”

Jack and Annie crawled back to the entrance of the hollow hill and peeked inside.

In the pale-green light, a very small Augusta stood watching the dancers.

“Excuse us, please!” Annie called.

The drumming stopped. The dancers froze. All eyes turned to Jack and Annie. The High King and High Queen looked startled.

“Who are you?” the king called. “How did you find us?”

“That’s not important!” said Annie. “We are very sorry to bother you! But we’ve come to get our very dear friend Augusta! We have to take her home to her very loving family!”

“Please! Thank you!” added Jack, trying to sound polite.

Before the king or queen could speak, Augusta rushed forward. “No! I don’t want to go home!” she screamed in a high little voice. “I don’t want to leave the Shee!”

“Whoa,” said Jack. That was a surprise. Maybe Augusta was under a spell!

“Leave here at once!” the High King commanded Jack and Annie in a squeaky voice. “You were not invited! You have no business here!”

“Yes, we are leaving right away. But Augusta has to come with us!” Annie called. “Thank you!”

“She’s right!” said Jack. “Augusta has to come with us, please. Thank you!”

“No! I want to stay here!” said Augusta. “I’m not good for anything at home! Mary was right, I’m not happy there!”

Jack was amazed—Augusta wasn’t under a spell. She really wanted to stay with the Shee!

“The girl will stay with us!” the High King shouted. “Go, now! Now!”

“No way!” Jack blurted out. “We won’t leave without Augusta!”

The crowd gasped.

“What?” roared the High King.

“Sorry, sorry,” said Jack. “I meant—”

“You will pay for this rudeness!” the king yelled.

Before Jack and Annie could get away, the king thrust out his arm. Sparks flew from the tips of his tiny fingers. Suddenly Jack and Annie couldn’t move their arms or legs!

The king kept pointing at them. “Skunks?” he shouted at the crowd. “Or weasels?”



“Neither, please! Thank you!” shouted Jack. He was glad he could still talk!

But the crowd began chanting in strange, high voices, “Skunks! Skunks! Skunks!”

The king nodded and raised both arms into the air. Jack was desperate. He didn’t want to live the rest of his life as a skunk!

“Wait! Please!” Jack shouted. “I’m sorry I was rude! Before you change us, I really, really need to tell Augusta some things! Thank you!”

The king looked at Jack for a long moment. Then he lowered his arms, and the crowd grew silent.

“Thank you!” said Jack. “Augusta, listen to me! You should go back home. You’re good for lots of things back there! You’re very kind! And Mary said you have a brave heart and a fine mind! Those are really good things to have!”

Tears rolled down Augusta’s cheeks. She shook her head.

“Listen to me, please!” Jack went on. “Mary says you’re not happy. But some things do make you happy, Augusta. You said you feel close to nature! You said you love simple folk like Mary. And I know you love stories, too! Mary said you remembered every story she told you! You used to tell them yourself, word for word! You have a great memory!”

“He’s right, Augusta!” yelled Annie. “Those are your gifts! You need to give your gifts to the world!”

Augusta was still for a moment. Then she shook her head. “I want to stay!” she said.

“You have had your say!” the High King shouted at Jack and Annie. “Now prepare to become skunks!” He raised his arms again.

Oh, no! thought Jack.

“Wait, Finvara!” said the High Queen.

The High Queen stepped closer to Augusta. The queen wore a silver cloak that glittered with diamonds. She had jewels in her long red hair that shone like stars. Her high, clear voice rang like a bell. “I am Queen Aine of the Shee,” she said. “The boy said you love stories—and that you remember every story you hear. Is this true?”

Augusta nodded.

“Then listen now to our story,” said Queen Aine.

All the Shee were very still, watching Augusta and their queen.

“In the morning of time, out of a rosy sky and a windy light, we came,” said Queen Aine. “We were tribes of a supernatural people called the Tuatha Dé Danann. Strong, fearless, and noble we were. Five roads carried our armies through the wild, wooded lands of Ireland, and for eons we ruled the Irish world.

“But when the humans came, the wild woods gave way to villages and pastures. Our tribes hid in the hollow hills, in ruined forts, and under the sea. Over time we made ourselves smaller and smaller so we could more easily hide from humans.

“Eventually we became known as the Shee, and we were mocked as the Wee Folk of Faerie. But, in truth, we are a tribe of the great Tuatha Dé Danann, and we live in enchanted places like this one, protected by what is left of our magic. Do you understand?”

“I do, yes,” breathed Augusta.

“Our stories were passed down for centuries in the old language of Ireland. But as the old language was replaced with English, the stories began to fade away,” Queen Aine said.

“Go home now with your friends, human child. Go back, for our sake. Seek out the old storytellers, and ask them to tell you the tales of my people. Learn the old language. Read the old manuscripts. Write our stories down and share them before they are lost completely. Share them with all the people of Ireland and all the world. Will you do that for us? Will you use your gifts to tell our stories and restore our dignity?”

Augusta’s eyes shone. “Yes,” she said, “yes, I will, yes.”

“Good. Then I will send you all swiftly home,” said Queen Aine. She beckoned to a small dancer, who stepped forward with a tiny silver chalice.

“Sip the honey nectar of the Shee,” said the High Queen. She took the chalice and held it out to Augusta. Augusta took a sip.

A second later, Jack felt cold wind and rain. He and Annie were standing on the bank of the river. Augusta was standing beside them. She was her normal size again.


10. Fare-thee-wells


“Well, that was simple and direct,” said Annie.

“Yeah.…” Jack felt dazed.

Augusta looked at Jack and Annie. “I saw them,” she said, her eyes wide. “I finally saw the Shee. I really saw them!” She burst out laughing. Her laughter was so full of joy that Jack and Annie started laughing, too.

“I saw them! I saw them!” Augusta kept repeating. “I saw the Shee! And now I have important things to do!”

“Yes, you do,” said Annie.

“I must learn the old language! And I must start gathering stories at once, that’s what Queen Aine told me!” said Augusta. “I can’t wait to visit the old storytellers! There’s Mary Sheridan and Biddy Early, too! I’ll start with Mary! Let’s go see her right now! Hurry! Will you come with me? Hurry!”

“Sure,” said Annie, “but just a second.” She turned to Jack. “What about Willy?”

“Who’s Willy?” asked Augusta.

“A friend of ours,” said Jack, looking around. “He said he’d wait for us. But where was he going to wait? Willy!”

“Willy!” called Annie.

“I guess he’s still somewhere on the other side of the river …,” said Jack.

“That’s too bad,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

“Come, let us go see Mary now!” said Augusta, grabbing Annie’s hand and pulling her along.

Jack looked around for Willy one last time. He was sad about not seeing the leprechaun again. But he was a little relieved, too. He knew they couldn’t keep their part of the deal: teaching Willy how to play the magic whistle.

“Come on, Jack!” cried Augusta.

Jack followed the two girls through the wet meadow, over the stone wall, down the dirt lane, and across the muddy field to Mary Sheridan’s cottage.

“Mary! Mary!” Augusta called. She dashed ahead of Jack and Annie. She didn’t even stop to knock. She threw open the door to the cottage. “Oh!” she said, freezing in her tracks.

Jack and Annie caught up with Augusta and looked inside.

Mary was sitting in front of her fire. Next to her was a small man wearing a green jacket and a three-cornered red cap with a white feather.

“Willy!” cried Annie.

Annie and Jack hurried past Augusta into the cottage.

“You’re here!” said Jack.

“Of course! I said I’d wait for you!” said the leprechaun. “I see you found your dear friend and brought her home. Good work!”

Augusta stood in the doorway, gaping at Willy. “Who are you?” she asked.

“Name’s Willy. Just plain Willy,” said the leprechaun. “I usually leave before you visit Mary. But now that you’ve seen the Shee, I suppose there’s no point hiding from you anymore.”



“Are—are you real?” asked Augusta.

“Who knows?” said the leprechaun. “Maybe I’m real and you’re not! Depends on which one of us is asking the question!”

Everyone laughed. “Good point,” said Annie.

“Well, we’d better be getting home,” said Jack. He wanted to leave before Willy asked Annie for his whistle lesson.

Jack took Annie’s hand and started backing toward the door. “Thanks for helping us, Willy,” he said.

“Yeah, and thanks, Mary, for everything!” said Annie, waving. “Good-bye, Augusta! Good-bye, everyone!”

“Wait just a minute, my friends,” said Willy.

Uh-oh, thought Jack.

“Have you forgotten our deal?” said Willy. “My fingers are itching to make beautiful music for Mary.”

“Well, you see … there’s a problem with that,” said Jack, squirming.

A frown crossed Willy’s face. “A problem?” he said. “How could there be a problem? Find your friend, teach Willy to play the whistle. Doesn’t get any simpler than that.”

“Right,” said Jack.

“So what’s the problem?” asked Willy.

“Well, the whistle …” Jack didn’t know how to finish.

“I’ll answer that question,” said Annie. “Willy, I’m going to be simple and direct and honest with you.”

“Yes …?” said the leprechaun.

“Merlin the magician gave us the whistle to help us on our missions,” said Annie. “The whistle is magic, and the magic only works once. Without the magic, I don’t really know how to play. So I can’t teach you. There you have it.”

“Ah,” said Willy. He looked at the floor and shook his head. “Then I’m afraid I’m going to have to turn you both into chipmunks.”

“What?” said Jack.

Willy burst out laughing. “Joking! Only joking!” he said. “Merlin! You should have told me you were friends with Merlin in the first place!”

“Do you know Merlin?” asked Jack.

“Oh, yes, we spent a great deal of time together. Must be about eight hundred years ago now,” said Willy. “How is he?”

“He’s happy,” said Annie.

“Good!” Willy turned back to Mary and Augusta. “I first met the master magician on the Isle of Merlin in the Irish Sea. He—”

“Wait, wait, please, Willy,” said Augusta. “Mary, do you have pen and paper?”

“No, my dear, I’m afraid I don’t,” said Mary.

“I can help,” said Jack. He took his pencil and small notebook out of his pocket. He tore some clean pages out of the notebook. Then he gave the pencil and pages to Augusta. “There,” he said.

“Oh, thank you, Jack!” said Augusta. She turned back to Willy. “Continue, please.”

“Well,” said Willy, “Merlin was only a few centuries old then, and I was a mere lad.…”

As Willy told his story, Augusta began to write. Jack put his notebook back into his pocket and nodded to Annie. She nodded back, and the two of them started toward the door.

Just as they were about to leave, Annie called out to the others, “Bye!”

“We have to go home now,” said Jack.

“Trip lightly!” said Willy.

“Thank you for everything!” said Augusta.

“One and twenty fare-thee-wells!” said Mary.

“Same to you guys,” said Jack. Then he and Annie slipped out of the cottage.

The rain was pouring again, and the wind was blowing hard.

“I think we inspired Augusta,” said Annie.

“Yep, we accomplished our mission,” said Jack. “Now let’s get out of here.” He couldn’t wait to go home and get warm and dry.

Jack and Annie ran against the wind. They climbed over the stone wall, then hurried down the lane, slipping and sliding in the muck. They ran across the soaked field. By the time they arrived at the rope ladder, their clothes were caked with mud.

Jack and Annie climbed into the tree house. Annie found the Pennsylvania book in the corner. As rain blew through the window, she pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there!” she said.

The wind blew harder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


11. Lady Gregory


“A hh, sunshine,” said Jack. He closed his eyes and felt the sunshine streaming through the tree house window.

“And clean, dry clothes,” murmured Annie. She placed the Pennsylvania book back in the corner.

Jack took the magic whistle out of his pocket and placed it next to the book. “There. Let’s go home now,” he said. “I want to look on the Internet for information about Augusta.” He started down the rope ladder.

“Great idea,” said Annie, following Jack. “We can find out what happened to her.”

Jack and Annie ran through the chilly Frog Creek woods. They crossed the street and hurried up the sparkling sidewalk to their yard. They tramped over old snow up to their porch. Annie opened the front door and led the way inside.

“Hi!” Jack called. “We’re back!”

“Hi!” their mom called from the kitchen. “Did you have a nice break?”

“Yes, we did!” said Annie.

“Good. Get back to your homework now,” said their mom. “So you can finish in time to go to the theater.”

“Okay!” called Annie. She went to the computer desk and sat down. “What should I type?” she asked Jack.

Jack pulled up a chair and sat beside her. “Well, we don’t know her last name,” he said. “So try Galway … Augusta … and Irish stories.”

Annie typed these words on the keyboard, then hit enter. There were lots of choices for different Web sites. Annie clicked on the first one.

On the screen was a black-and-white photograph of a woman. The caption under it said:

Lady Augusta Gregory

“Look! It’s her!” said Annie.

The woman on the screen was middle-aged, but she still looked like Augusta. Her hair was parted neatly down the middle.

Jack read aloud from the screen:

Lady Augusta Gregory was born into a wealthy family in Galway, Ireland, in 1852. She wrote over forty plays and many poems and essays. She was a co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland. Lady Gregory also learned the old language of Ireland and became well known for collecting Irish stories and legends and sharing them with the world.



“Wow!” said Annie. “Augusta did have a brave heart and a fine mind! And she must have liked our play, since she wrote forty of her own and started her own theater.”



“Yeah,” said Jack. “She really turned out great.” This reminded him of a question he’d asked himself earlier. “I wonder what I’m good for? I didn’t know how to do anything on that Irish farm.”

“Me neither,” said Annie. “But hardly any kids today know how to do that kind of stuff.”

“So what would we do if all our machines and computers broke down?” said Jack.

“We’d have to figure out how to grow potatoes and make our own clothes and milk cows,” said Annie.

“I’d probably read some kind of instructions first, then give it a try,” said Jack.

“I’d probably give it a try first,” said Annie, “then read the instructions.”

Jack laughed.

“I know some stuff we’re good for,” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“First, we’re good for helping each other,” said Annie.

“Yeah, but—” said Jack.

“No, really. We help each other all the time,” said Annie.

“That’s true,” said Jack.

“And we’re good for helping Augusta,” said Annie, “and helping Louis Armstrong, Mozart, and Leonardo da Vinci. We put the smile on the Mona Lisa’s face, remember?”

Jack nodded. “Yep,” he said.

“And we’re good for saving an orphan penguin, a huge octopus, and the cities of Tokyo, Venice, and New York,” said Annie. “We’re good for rescuing a baby gorilla from a leopard, and schoolkids from a twister. We’re good for helping Shakespeare, Clara Barton, and George Washington. We’re good for rescuing two kids from a tsunami, a Lakota boy from a buffalo stampede, and a baby kangaroo and a koala from a forest fire. We’re good for—”

“Wait, stop,” said Jack. “Stop.”

“But that’s not even half of it,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. “But that’s plenty. I’m inspired. I’m ready to write that story for homework. I’ll use my own experience. I have a little more than I thought.”

“Cool,” said Annie. She went back to reading about Lady Gregory on the computer.

Jack grabbed a pencil and pulled out his notebook. He moved to the couch and sat down. As late-winter light slanted into the living room, he began to write.



More Facts from Jack and Annie

Irish Fairies

• There was a time when many people in Ireland believed in fairies who lived inside mounds of earth. The name for Irish fairies is Sí. In Ireland, the word Sí is pronounced Shee. To avoid confusion in my story, I refer to the fairies as the Shee.

• Leprechauns are a type of male Irish fairy. In folktales they often work as shoemakers or tailors and are thought to have hidden pots of gold. Leprechauns are featured on St. Patrick’s Day, a national holiday in Ireland celebrated on March 17.

Lady Gregory

• When she was a child, Lady Gregory’s full name was Isabella Augusta Persse, though everyone called her Augusta. After she grew up, she married Sir William Henry Gregory. As the wife of a knight, she was called Lady Gregory.

• Ireland’s most famous poet is William Butler Yeats (YATES). He was a very good friend of Lady Gregory’s. Together in 1904, they founded Dublin’s Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland.

• William Butler Yeats often accompanied Lady Gregory when she visited cottages and collected Irish folklore. It was said that Lady Gregory had a natural genius for remembering the direct speech of storytellers. “In her many years of traveling, listening, transcribing and publishing, Lady Gregory … gave value to the stories, to the mind and the imagination of Irish country people” (Lucy McDiarmid and Maureen Waters, introduction to Lady Gregory: Selected Writings).

Irish Language

• From the 1600s to the early 1900s, the language of Ireland, called Irish Gaelic, was replaced by English in many parts of Ireland. During the struggle for Irish independence in the twentieth century, the desire to learn the old language became very strong in Ireland. In 1922, Irish Gaelic became the official language of the country along with English. Today it is taught in Irish public schools. Lady Gregory’s knowledge of Irish Gaelic helped her when she visited cottages and collected stories.

For Jack and Cathy Desroches





When I was in high school, I spent most of my free time at our town’s little theater, acting in plays or working behind the scenes. One year, I was involved in a production of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, a timeless story that readers and theater audiences have enjoyed for over 150 years. After weeks of working backstage, I felt as if I had really visited the exciting, dramatic world of Charles Dickens’s Victorian England. One reason I decided to write A Ghost Tale for Christmas Time is that I was eager to revisit that world.

That’s the magic of using your imagination: whether you put on a play, write a story, or read a novel, you often end up feeling as if you’ve actually visited other places, met new people, and shared their adventures. After you finish this book, I hope you’ll feel that you’ve just spent time with Jack, Annie, and Charles Dickens—that you’ve escaped an angry crowd with them, feasted in an old inn with them, and seen three ghosts with them!

So get ready to wander the twilight streets of London, England, long ago. Horses clomp over the cobblestones, and soon the fog will be rolling in.…






“There is probably a smell of roasted chestnuts and other good comfortable things all the time, for we are telling Winter Stories—Ghost Stories … round the Christmas fire …”

—Charles Dickens, from “A Christmas Tree”





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie had traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history. After they proved to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he awarded them the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that helped them make their own magic. With the wand, Jack and Annie were then able to find four secrets of happiness to help Merlin when he was in trouble.

Now Merlin wants Jack and Annie to bring happiness to others by helping four creative people give their special gifts to the world. They have already helped the first three—Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Louis Armstrong, and Lady Augusta Gregory. Now Jack and Annie are ready to find the last person.…


1. Did You See That?


Jack and Annie were walking home from soccer practice. It was four-thirty in the afternoon. Sunlight was fading quickly.

“November has really short days,” said Jack.

“Yeah, but it has really beautiful skies,” said Annie.

The horizon glowed with the orange light of sunset. Suddenly a streak of light blazed over the Frog Creek woods.

“Whoa!” said Jack. “Did you see that?”

“See what?” said Annie.

“A streak of light!” said Jack. “Like a shooting star!”

“Over the woods?” asked Annie.

“Over the woods!” said Jack. He started to run.

“Run!” said Annie.

“I’m running!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran down the sidewalk and into the Frog Creek woods. Their feet crunched through fallen leaves as they raced among the shadows. Finally they came to the tallest oak in the woods. The magic tree house sat high in the branches.

Teddy and Kathleen were looking out of the tree house window. The two young enchanters seemed to glow in the fading daylight. Teddy was grinning and waving. Kathleen’s long dark hair blew in the breeze.

“Hello!” Teddy called.

“Hello yourself!” Annie shouted back.

“Come up!” called Kathleen.

Jack and Annie hurried up the rope ladder. They climbed inside the tree house and hugged Teddy and Kathleen.

“We haven’t seen you guys in so long!” said Jack. “What have you been doing?”

“Oh, learning more magic—and practicing it,” said Teddy. “Turning frogs into boys.”

“And boys into frogs,” said Kathleen, smiling at Teddy.

“Yes, I rather enjoyed being a frog for a day,” said Teddy.

Jack and Annie laughed.

“We missed you!” said Annie.

“We missed you, too,” said Kathleen. “We were both delighted when Merlin told us it was time to send you on a new mission.”

“Does he want us to help another great artist give their gifts to the world?” asked Jack.

“Yes,” said Teddy. “So far you have helped Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Louis Armstrong, and Lady Augusta Gregory. Now your mission is to travel to Victorian England and help Charles Dickens.”

“His name sounds familiar,” said Jack. “But I can’t remember why.”

“Me neither,” said Annie.

“I am sure you will know a great deal about him by the end of your mission,” said Kathleen. “In the meantime, here is something to help you.” She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a book.



The cover showed two girls wearing long skirts and big bonnets. The girls were walking along a path lined with trees. Behind the trees were buildings with towers and tall chimneys.

“London?” said Jack. “That’s the city in England where we met William Shakespeare!”

“Yes, but Charles Dickens lived over two hundred years after Shakespeare’s time,” said Kathleen. “He lived in the 1800s, during Victorian times.”

“What’s that mean? ‘Victorian times’?” asked Annie.

“It means the years during which a queen named Victoria ruled the British Empire,” said Teddy.

“Cool, a queen,” said Annie. “But can I ask you something? This cover shows girls in long hoop-skirts like I wore when we went to the time of Mozart. It was really hard to run and do stuff in those clothes. Can I please wear something else?”

Teddy laughed. “Yes, I think we can arrange for you to wear more comfortable clothing,” he said. “But you may have to pretend to be a boy.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie.

“So do we have a magic instrument for this mission?” asked Jack.

“Indeed,” said Kathleen. “We gave you a magic flute to help Mozart, a magic trumpet to help Louis Armstrong, and a magic Irish whistle to help Lady Augusta Gregory. Do you still have the whistle?”

“Sure, we left it here,” said Annie. She grabbed the whistle from the corner of the tree house and gave it to Kathleen.

“Thank you,” said Kathleen. She tossed the whistle into the air. It spun around and around. There was a flash of blue. The whistle was gone. Floating in its place were a small violin and bow. Kathleen reached up and took them from the air.

“Here is a magic violin to help you on your journey,” she said.

“I really like violin music,” said Jack.

“Good,” said Kathleen. She handed the violin and bow to Jack. “Then on this mission, perhaps you should play while Annie makes up a song.”

“No problem,” said Annie. “And whatever I sing will come true, right?”

“Exactly,” said Teddy.

“Any more questions?” asked Kathleen.

“Nope,” said Annie.

Jack was sure he had more questions. But before he had time to think of any, Annie pointed to the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there!” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



2. Two Gentlemen from Frog Creek

Jack and Annie were both dressed in brown-and-green velvet jackets and dark pants. They wore loose wool caps and shiny new boots. Jack’s backpack had become a green velvet bag with a brass buckle.

“Fancy clothes,” said Jack.

“Well, at least I’m not wearing a giant skirt, like I wore in Vienna,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and these boots aren’t full of holes, like the boots we wore in Ireland,” said Jack.

“So where did we land?” said Annie. She and Jack looked out the window.



The tree house had landed in a row of big trees. Beyond the trees was a grassy park with gardens and pathways.

Bordering the park was a busy road filled with horse-drawn carriages. Autumn sunlight shone on rooftops, towers, and church steeples. Black smoke rose from hundreds of chimneys.

“London looks great,” said Annie. “Let’s start looking for Charles Dickens.”

“Wait, I’ll check the book first,” said Jack.

Jack looked in the index of their book and found Charles Dickens. He turned to a page with a photograph of a handsome man with wavy brown hair and huge eyes. Jack read:

Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. He is one of the most famous writers of all time.



“Of all time?” said Annie. “Wow, he shouldn’t be hard to find.”

“Maybe he isn’t famous yet,” said Jack. “If he is, why would he need our help?”

“Good question,” said Annie. “Let’s start looking for the answer.”

“Okay, but first you’d better hide your pigtails,” said Jack.

“Oh, right. I’m supposed to be a boy,” said Annie. She tucked her pigtails under her cap. “In the past, girls didn’t have many choices, did they? How do I look?”

“Fine,” Jack said.

“Good, let’s go,” said Annie.

As Annie climbed out of the tree house, Jack unbuckled the green velvet bag. He put their research book and magic violin and bow inside. Then he buckled the bag and followed Annie down the ladder.

When Jack stepped off the ladder, he heard jingling in his coat pocket. He reached in and pulled out a handful of coins. “Hey, I have money!” he said.

Annie dug into her pockets. “Me too!” she said.

“Great,” said Jack. “I didn’t like being poor on our last two missions.”

Jack and Annie crunched through fallen leaves until they came to the open park area. A man stood on a platform giving a speech. Women pushed baby buggies. Children sailed toy boats on a pond.

“We have to ask someone for help,” said Annie, looking around. “Excuse me!” she called to a woman in a flowery bonnet. “Do you know where Charles Dickens lives?”

“Why, yes, he and his family live at One Devonshire Terrace,” the woman said, “below Regent’s Park.”

“Thanks,” said Annie.

“That was easy,” said Jack as the woman strolled on.

“I guess he’s already famous,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, pulling out their book again. “Let’s see if there’s a map.” He thumbed through the book until he found a map of London. “Here it is. Regent’s Park.” He looked up. “Where are we now?”

“That sign over there says Hyde Park,” said Annie.

“Wrong park,” said Jack. He looked at the map again. “Okay. Hyde Park is here … and Regent’s Park is here. They’re pretty far away from each other.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “We have money, and London has carriages. This will be fun!”

“Right,” said Jack. “Let’s go catch a ride.”

Jack and Annie hurried over the grass to the busy street bordering the park. Carriages of all shapes and sizes clattered over the cobblestones. Four high-stepping horses pulled an elegant black coach. Two donkeys pulled an old wooden wagon with benches.

“Excuse me!” Jack called to the driver of a small red carriage waiting on the street. “Can you take us to One Devonshire Terrace, below Regent’s Park?”

The driver smiled down from his seat. “Indeed, sir!” he said. “I would be proud to carry two fine young gentlemen across our fair city.”

Jack caught Annie’s eye and smiled. “Thank you,” he said.

“Climb into my cab, if you please,” said the driver. “Where are you gentlemen from?”

“Frog Creek,” said Annie in a deep voice.

“Frog Creek!” said the driver. “Lovely place, I’m sure.” Then he flicked the reins, and his fat little horse started clopping up the cobblestone street.

In the cool autumn air, the red cab clattered by toy shops, bootmakers, and hatmakers. The cab passed brick mansions with gardens and ornate buildings with turrets and towers.

“This is a beautiful city,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He pulled out their book and turned to the beginning. One of the first pages showed a portrait of a plump-faced woman in a red robe. She wore a small crown on her head.

The Victorian era in England began when Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837. She ruled for the rest of the century and helped her country become a powerful world empire.



“Wow,” said Annie. She stuck her head out the window of the cab and called up to the driver, “Excuse me, sir! Where’s the queen today?”

“I believe she’s on holiday with Prince Albert,” said the driver.

“How long has she been queen?” asked Annie.

“Let’s see, she was crowned and moved into Buckingham Palace six years ago,” the driver said.

“Thanks!” said Annie. She sat back in her seat. “I love this time in history, with a queen, a prince, and a palace.”

“Yep,” said Jack. He read on:

During the reign of Queen Victoria, England went through a period known as the Industrial Revolution. People no longer worked mainly on farms. The invention of machines led to work in factories and mines. Many people became very wealthy.



Jack glanced out the window. The people on the sidewalks did look wealthy. Women and girls dressed in ruffles and ribbons strolled in and out of elegant shops. Boys wore frilly white shirts. Men wore top hats and suits.

Jack read on:

But while many people became rich in Victorian England, many more worked under terrible conditions. Even young children worked in factories and mines. Rich and poor lived side by side, but they lived in very different worlds. While the rich feasted in grand mansions, the poor often died young of hunger and disease.



“Whoa,” said Annie. “Maybe I don’t love this time as much as I thought.”

The horse and cab came to a halt. “Here we are!” the driver called. “One Devonshire Terrace.”

Jack closed their book and looked up. The cab had stopped in front of a high brick wall with an iron gate. Jack and Annie stepped down to the sidewalk. The driver climbed off of his perch.

“How much do we owe you?” asked Jack.

“One shilling, if you please, sir,” said the driver.

Jack reached into his pocket and took out a large coin. He had no idea how much it was worth, but he gave it to the driver. “I hope this is enough,” he said.

The man’s eyes grew wide. “Why, good heavens, I should say it is! Thank you, gentlemen! Thank you! Thank you! My children thank you! All the good, hardworking people of the world thank you! Shall I come to pick you up later?”

“Sorry, but we don’t know how long we’ll be here,” said Jack.

“Well, perhaps I’ll pass by this way now and again,” the driver said. “If I see you, I shall certainly stop. I’m always pleased to carry such fine young gentlemen!” The man bowed. Then he climbed back up onto his bench. “Good day, good sirs!” he called, tipping his hat.

As the horse and cab clattered away, Jack looked at Annie. “He was nuts,” he said.

Annie laughed. “I think you gave him a lot more than the regular fare,” she said.

The gate behind Jack and Annie swung open. Three small children bounded out to the sidewalk, two girls with curly hair and a round-faced boy.

A woman with a baby followed them out. “Mary! Kate! Charley! Wait for me!”

“Hurry, Mother!” yelled the little boy.

“You wait for me, Charley Dickens!” the young mother called. She caught up with the children, and they all vanished around the corner.

“Charley Dickens?” said Jack, stunned.



3. Riches to Rags

Jack looked at Annie. “She called that kid Charley Dickens,” he said.

“I heard,” said Annie. “So Charles Dickens must be five or six years old.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack, groaning. “So Merlin wants us to help another little kid, like we helped Wolfie Mozart?”

“Seems like it,” said Annie.

“Wait a minute. That doesn’t make sense. Let’s do the math,” said Jack. “Our book said Charles Dickens was born in 1812.” He pulled out their research book and looked at the first page. “And Queen Victoria became queen in 1837.”

“The driver said she’s been queen for six years …,” said Annie. “So now it’s 1843. Subtract 1812 from 1843.…”

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. “And you get … thirty-one!” he said.

“Good work!” said Annie.

“So Charles Dickens is thirty-one,” said Jack. “And Charley must be Charles Junior.”

“Great,” said Annie. “Let’s go meet Charles Senior.”

Jack put away their book, and he and Annie walked to the front gate. Between the iron bars, they could see a beautiful three-story house with tall windows.

“Nice place,” said Annie. “It looks like Charles Dickens has already given his gifts to the world.”

“Yeah, and gotten some back,” said Jack. “So I wonder what his problem is?”

“We’ll have to figure that out when we meet him,” said Annie. She jangled a bell hanging from the gate.

A moment later, the front door opened. A stout woman in a white apron came out and walked to the gate. “Yes?” she said through the bars.

“Is this the Dickens residence?” said Annie.

“Yes,” said the woman.

“Ah, excellent!” said Annie. “We’ve come to call on Charles Dickens.”

“Indeed? Who are you?” asked the woman.

“We’re Jack and An—” started Annie.

“Andrew!” finished Jack.

“Right,” said Annie, clearing her throat and deepening her voice. “We’re Jack and Andrew from Frog Creek. And who are you?”

“I am Mrs. Tibbs, the housekeeper,” said the woman. “And it is my sad job to tell you that Mr. Dickens can have no visitors today. He is working on his latest book and cannot be disturbed.”

“Mrs. Tibbs,” said Annie, “may we have just five short minutes of Mr. Dickens’s time, please?”

“Young man, I am afraid that right now Mr. Dickens needs every minute he can spare for his writing,” said Mrs. Tibbs. “Surely you know how important Mr. Dickens’s work is.”

“Yes, ma’am, surely we do,” said Jack. “But—”

“I am terribly sorry, young gentlemen,” said Mrs. Tibbs. “It grieves me to turn you away, but I must. I pray that you will bear no grudge against Mr. Dickens.” With that, Mrs. Tibbs turned and hurried back inside.

“Well, that didn’t get us very far,” said Jack.

“Surely it did not,” said Annie.

“Pardon us, sirs,” someone said.

Jack and Annie turned around.

Two boys with dirty clothes and dirty faces were standing behind them. The taller boy wore an old top hat, and the smaller one wore a wool cap that was too big for him. He carried a large, round brush, a broom, and some rags.

“Oh … hi,” said Jack.

“We was just needing to ring the bell, sir, if you don’t mind,” the bigger boy said.

“Sure,” said Jack. “But the housekeeper’s not letting anyone in today. That’s why we’re leaving.”

“She’ll let us in,” said the smaller boy. “We’ve come to sweep the chimneys.”

“Really? She’ll let you into the house?” said Annie. “Hold on.” She turned to Jack. “I’ve got an idea!”

“No you don’t,” said Jack. “See you, guys. Bye.” He tried to move Annie along, but she pulled away.

“Wait, don’t ring the bell yet,” Annie said to the boys. “Would you be interested in trading places with us for a while?”

“Annie—” said Jack.

“Shh,” said Annie.

The boys looked confused. “Trade places?” asked the bigger boy. “Why?”

“Actually—” said Jack.

But Annie jumped in. “Here’s the deal,” she said. “We’ve come a long way. And we really, really want to talk to Mr. Dickens. So … maybe if we go in and clean the chimneys, we’ll have a chance.”

“We can’t lose our wages,” said the bigger boy.

“How much do you get paid for this job?” asked Annie.

“Twopence,” said the smaller boy.

Annie reached into her pocket and pulled out a handful of coins. She gave them to the boy. “Is that good?”

Both boys looked at her with wide eyes and nodded eagerly.

“And you’ll get our coats, too,” said Annie. “If you give us yours.”

“Whoa, whoa. Excuse me,” Jack said. He pulled Annie aside. “This is not a good plan.”

“Yes it is,” Annie said. “Remember when we got kicked out of the Big House in Ireland? If we’d had a job, we could have hung around there longer.”

“But we don’t know how to sweep chimneys,” said Jack.

“How hard can it be?” said Annie. “It will get us inside the house. Then we can keep an eye out for Mr. Dickens. The next thing you know, we’ve figured out the problem and we’re playing our magic music and Mr. Dickens is giving more gifts to the world. Mission accomplished!”

Before Jack could protest, Annie turned back to the chimney sweeps. “So do you want to trade your coats for ours? Hats, too?”

The boys stared at her in wonder. “Them is fine coats, Harry!” said the smaller boy. “And fine hats, too!” He threw down the brush, broom, and rags. He traded his coat for Annie’s velvet coat, and traded his dirty, ragged cap for her new, clean cap.

“Hey, you’re a girl!” the boy said when he saw Annie’s braids.

“So what if I am?” Annie asked, tucking her braids under the dirty cap.

“Forget it, Colin. Rich folks are strange,” Harry said. He pulled off his coat and held it out to Jack. “Here,” he said with a big grin.

Jack sighed and traded his beautiful velvet coat and wool cap for Harry’s tattered coat and old top hat.

“And what about your boots?” asked Harry.

Jack looked down at his shiny leather boots. He looked at Harry’s dirty, old shoes.

“Come on, Jack,” said Annie. “These guys need them more than we do.”

Annie pulled off her boots. Colin took off his shoes and handed them to her. Jack sighed again and sat down to take off his boots.



Colin and Harry stood tall in their new boots and jackets and hats.

“How ’bout it, Colin?” said Harry, shaking his head. “In two minutes, we went from rags to riches.”

Colin let out a wild whoop. Then the two boys linked arms and danced a jig, kicking up their boots. When they stopped dancing, Harry rang the gate bell wildly.

As the bell clanged, the front door of the house flew open. The housekeeper stuck her head outside. “Stop the noise, you idiots! I’m comin’!” she screeched.

“Let’s go, Colin, before they change their minds!” said Harry.

As the two boys ran off in their new velvet coats, Jack heard money jingling. “Oh, no!” he said. “We forgot to empty our pockets!”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “I’m sure they need the money more than we do. They were so happy going from rags to riches.”

“Yeah, right,” said Jack, “and we just went from riches to rags.”

“Shh! Here comes Mrs. Tibbs!” said Annie. “We’d better smudge our faces with the rags so she won’t recognize us.” She rubbed her face with a dirty rag, then Jack’s. “There! You look like a real chimney sweep now.”

The housekeeper stomped to the gate and unlocked it. “Don’t break my eardrums next time, you knaves!” she cried.

Jack and Annie grabbed the brush and broom. They kept their heads down as they headed for the front door. “Not that door, you fools!” yelled Mrs. Tibbs. “Go round to the back!”


4. Out! Out! Out!


Jack and Annie hurried around to the back door and slipped inside the house. They walked through a small, dark mudroom, then stepped into the large front hallway. Sun slanted through the tall windows. Everything seemed to be made of carved wood or marble. A wide staircase curved up to the second floor.

“Get to work, sweeps!” barked the housekeeper. “Do the regular!”

Mrs. Tibbs left them and clomped down the back stairs. Jack heard pots clattering below. He realized the kitchen must be in the cellar. The rest of the house was quiet, as if it were waiting for the mother and children to return.

“I wonder where Mr. Dickens is writing,” Annie whispered.

“He must be working quietly somewhere in the house,” said Jack.

Mrs. Tibbs came bustling up the back stairs and burst into the front hallway. “I told you to get to work!” she said. “If I don’t see you working in two minutes, I’ll throw you out on your ears!” The housekeeper then disappeared up the wide staircase to the second floor.

“I guess we’d better get to work,” said Jack.

“So where do we start?” said Annie.

“Let’s check out the fireplaces on this floor,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie crept into a dining room that overlooked a garden. A fire crackled in the hearth.

“She can’t expect us to clean that chimney,” said Jack, “unless she wants us to burn to death.”

Jack and Annie went back through the front hall and into a room filled with leather-bound books.

There was no fire in the large fireplace, but the room was bright and warm. It had big windows, a rich-colored plush carpet, and mirrors that reflected the light from outside. A vase of fresh flowers sat on a desk facing one of the windows.

“Oh, man, I love this room,” said Jack, staring at all the books.

“Yeah, and look—there’s a desk with a feather pen and paper,” said Annie. “I’ll bet this is where Mr. Dickens does his writing. I wonder where he is.”

“Maybe he’s taking a break,” said Jack.

“Maybe he’ll come in here soon,” said Annie. “Let’s start cleaning the chimney.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “But first we have to figure out how.” He unbuckled the green bag and pulled out their research book. He looked in the index and found chimney sweeps. He turned to the right page and read aloud:

In Victorian England, young boys worked as chimney sweeps, cleaning the soot made by coal fires. It was not only a dirty job, but a dangerous one as well.



“Great.” Jack closed the book. “Good work, Annie. You made us give up our nice clothes and all our money, and you landed us a dirty, dangerous job.”

“Don’t worry,” said Annie. “We shoveled coal, washed dishes, and hauled bananas with Louis Armstrong. We can do this.”

“Yeah, but how do we do it? The book doesn’t tell us,” said Jack.

“Well, we’ve got a brush, a broom, and rags,” said Annie. “Let’s start by using them. Remember, we’re just waiting to run into Charles Dickens. Then we’ll chat with him and play our music and—”

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He put the book away.

Jack and Annie stepped into the hearth. Annie got down on her hands and knees and began scrubbing the stones with the brush. Jack pushed his broom up the chimney and tried to sweep the soot off the bricks. A pile of soft black powder fell on his head. It got in his eyes and mouth.

“Oh, no!” whispered Jack, puffing and blowing. As he squeezed his eyes shut, he felt Annie yank his sleeve.

“Don’t …,” he said. “I—”

“Shh!” whispered Annie. “He’s here!”

Jack opened his watery eyes. He saw a small, slender man standing in the hallway outside the door. The man had wavy brown hair. He wore a dark coat and pants. He was reading some papers and muttering to himself.

“Mr. Dickens,” whispered Annie.

Before Jack could say anything, the man shouted, “Let no one enter my study, Mrs. Tibbs! Under penalty of death!” And he came into his study and slammed the door.

Penalty of death? thought Jack. He’s got to be kidding! But he and Annie crouched down in the fireplace.

Mr. Dickens didn’t notice them or Jack’s green velvet bag sitting on the carpet. As he crossed the room, he kept looking at his papers and muttering to himself. He sat down at the desk, facing the window. He picked up the feather pen, dipped it into an ink pot, and began to write.

Suddenly Mr. Dickens leapt out of his chair and rushed to one of the mirrors. He put his hands around his neck and cried, “AGHHH!” He struggled and made a horrible face as if someone were choking him.

Then the writer hurried back to his desk and scrawled a few more lines. He stopped and read what he’d written. “Good, good!” he said.

Then Mr. Dickens leapt up again and rushed back to the mirror. This time he rapped his head with his knuckles. He looked furious. “Bah-bah-bah!” he shouted.

Jack and Annie watched, fascinated.

Again Mr. Dickens hurried back to his desk and wrote. He stopped and read what he’d written. Then he crumpled the paper and threw it across the room. He covered his face with his hands and murmured, “I can’t, I can’t!” He was still for a long moment.

“Excuse me. Are you okay?” Annie asked in a soft voice.

Mr. Dickens gasped and whirled around. He saw Jack’s green velvet bag on the carpet. “What’s that? Who’s here?” Then he saw Jack and Annie huddled in the fireplace. He jumped out of his chair.



“Chimney sweeps?” he cried. “Why—why are you in my study?”

“Sorry, we’re just working on the chimney,” said Annie.

Mr. Dickens groaned. “I—I can’t bear it,” he said. “I have to get out. I have to leave.…” He rushed across the room and threw open the door.

The housekeeper was sweeping in the hallway. “What’s wrong, Mr. Dickens?” she asked.

“I’m finished for today, Mrs. Tibbs,” said Mr. Dickens. “They—they …” He pointed back into his study.

Mrs. Tibbs saw Jack and Annie. “Oh! What are you doing in there?” she cried. “Mr. Dickens, I’m sorry! They—”

“Never—never mind. I’m going out,” said Mr. Dickens. “Tell Mrs. Dickens I don’t know when I’ll be back.” He grabbed his hat and walking stick. Then he hurried out the front door.

“Mr. Dickens, don’t go!” cried Mrs. Tibbs. But the door closed before she could stop him.

Mrs. Tibbs whirled around and charged into the room. “What are you doing in here, filthy brats?” she shrieked. “You know you’re to start with the back rooms! Not his study! Never his study!” She waved her broom at them, as if she was trying to sweep them away. “Out! Out! Out!”

Jack grabbed his green bag. Then he and Annie fled from Mrs. Tibbs and her broom. They hurried out the front door.

Mrs. Tibbs followed them to the iron gate. “Poor Mr. Dickens! You’ve ruined his day!” she cried. “I hope that makes you happy!”

“No, it doesn’t,” said Annie.

“All of England is waiting for his next story!” cried Mrs. Tibbs.

Oh, brother, thought Jack.

Mrs. Tibbs yanked open the gate. As Jack and Annie tried to slip past her, she grabbed Jack by his jacket. She looked at him closely. “Why, you’re not Harry!” She turned and looked at Annie. “And you’re not Colin! What have you done with my regular sweeps?” she cried.

“Nothing! They’re fine!” said Jack.

“You better not have hurt them, you scamps!” she said, pushing Jack and then Annie out onto the sidewalk.

“They’re fine! We promise! We’re sorry!” said Annie.

“There’s no forgiveness for all the harm you’ve done today!” the housekeeper said, looking as if she might burst into tears. Then she pushed the iron gate shut. It slammed with a loud clang!


5. Stop, Thief!


“Oh, man,” said Jack, dazed. “She was nuts. Everyone here is nuts, including Mr. Dickens.”

“It’s all my fault,” said Annie. “I shouldn’t have—”

“No, no, don’t worry,” said Jack. “We just have to catch him and try to fix things.”

“He couldn’t have gone far,” said Annie. She and Jack glanced up and down the busy street. The afternoon sun had disappeared. Dark clouds filled the sky.

“Look, there he is!” said Annie, pointing.

Jack saw Mr. Dickens weaving through the horse-and-carriage traffic. He was signaling to a cabdriver with his walking stick.

“Mr. Dickens!” cried Annie. She started into the street, but Jack grabbed her just in time. Another horse and cab clattered by, barely missing them.

“He’s getting away!” said Annie.

“I know,” said Jack. “But we don’t want to get run over!”

“Look!” said Annie. “There’s the driver who brought us here! I’ll bet he’s waiting for us!”

Across the street was the red cab pulled by the small, fat horse.

“Great!” said Jack. He dodged the carriage traffic and rushed toward the driver. “Hi! Hi there!” Jack yelled. “Thanks for coming back! We need a ride! We have to follow—” He started to climb into the cab.

“Sorry, no free rides today, boy!” the driver said. “I’ve got mouths to feed at home!” He jiggled his reins, and his horse took off.

Jack nearly fell backward onto the sidewalk. “Wait! Don’t you remember us?” he called. “We’re the young gentlemen from Frog Creek!”

But the driver didn’t seem to hear him in all the traffic.

Annie touched Jack’s arm. “He didn’t recognize us. We don’t look like gentlemen anymore,” she said. “Our clothes are ragged, and we’re covered with soot.”

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “Everyone was nice to us when we looked rich. Now it feels like the whole world’s against us.”

“I’m sorry, it’s all my fault,” said Annie.

“Forget it,” said Jack. “We just have to find Mr. Dickens. Come on. Let’s try to find his carriage.”

Clutching his green bag, Jack led the way down the street. He and Annie half ran, half walked past a long row of shops. As they looked for Mr. Dickens, they passed little girls sewing in the window of a dress shop. They saw boys sweeping trash and polishing boots, and girls selling matches and meat pies. Jack had never seen so many kids working at real jobs.

“Hey, isn’t that him getting out of that carriage?” said Annie. She pointed to an intersection in the distance.

A small man wearing a top hat and carrying a walking stick was climbing down from a cab.

“Yeah, I think it is!” said Jack. “Hurry!”

Jack and Annie ran up the sidewalk, dodging shoppers and merchants. By the time they got to the intersection, Mr. Dickens had disappeared again.

“Darn,” said Annie.

“Let’s keep looking,” said Jack. “If we don’t find him soon, we’ll go back to his house and wait for him outside the gate.”

A light rain began to fall as Jack and Annie started down a crowded, muddy road. They passed shabby shops and rows of small shacks. They passed vendors selling secondhand clothes and hats and shoes. They saw lots of ragged kids hanging around the street.

Jack caught the eye of a big, tough-looking boy slouching against a lamppost with his hands in his pockets. As Jack passed him, the boy looked him over. Jack saw the boy say something to another kid. The two of them started walking after Jack and Annie.

“I think we’re being followed,” Jack said.

“Walk faster,” said Annie.

As Jack and Annie hurried up the muddy street, black smoke from chimneys blended with the rain. The air felt grimy and dirty.

Jack glanced back. The two boys were getting closer to them.

“Run!” said Jack.

Jack and Annie ran past a butcher shop, a bakery, and a cigar store. Jack looked over his shoulder. The boys were running, too!

Jack slipped in the mud and fell. Before he could get up, the tough-looking kid caught up with him. The boy grabbed Jack’s green velvet bag and took off. The magic violin, the bow, and their book were in the bag!

“Help! Stop him!” cried Jack. “He’s got my bag!”

Jack jumped up from the mud and charged after the kid. But the big boy tossed the bag to the other boy.

“That one’s got it now!” Annie yelled, pointing.

Jack and Annie took off after the boy with the stolen bag. Fierce anger made Jack run as fast as he could. He caught up with the kid and wrestled the bag away from him. Then Jack turned around and started running back the way they’d come. Annie followed.

“Stop, thief!” the boy yelled.

Jack and Annie kept running through the black rain, passing the same shops again.

“Stop, thief!” Both boys were yelling now. “Stop, thief!”

Thief! Jack thought wildly. Why were they calling him thief?

But others quickly joined the two boys, chasing after Jack and Annie:

“Stop, thief!” the butcher yelled.

“Stop, thief!” the baker yelled.

“Stop, thief!” the cigar seller yelled.

Even dogs and old ladies joined the chase through the muddy streets.

Jack looked over his shoulder. The two boys and a bunch of grown-ups and dogs were running after him and Annie. Everyone was yelling, “Stop, thief!”

“What should we do?” cried Annie.

“Keep running,” Jack answered. He clutched the green bag closer to his chest and spotted an alley up ahead. “Turn right!” he called.

Jack and Annie ran into the narrow alleyway filled with junk—broken wagon wheels, cracked plates, old pots and pans. The crowd followed them down the alley. Everyone kept shrieking, “Stop, thief!”

As the black rain fell, Jack and Annie scrambled over the rubble, desperately looking for an escape. Soon they came to a dead end. There was nowhere else to run!



Jack and Annie turned around. The crowd was closing in on them. Jack clutched the green bag in his hand. “Get away from us!” he shouted. “This is my bag! It’s mine!”

But the crowd kept moving toward him, led by the two boys who’d stolen the bag. They sneered at Jack. “We’ve got you now, thief,” said one.

“Just hand the bag over to us,” said the other, “or we’ll have to take it.”

“Play the violin, Jack!” said Annie.

Of course! thought Jack. Only magic could save them now! Jack turned his back to the crowd. But before he could unbuckle the bag, someone grabbed him by his shirt collar. Jack looked up.

A large man wearing a blue uniform loomed over him. “I’ll take that bag, boy,” the policeman said, holding out his hand.


6. To Jail


Jack handed the policeman his green bag. “But it’s mine, sir!” he tried to explain. “I promise it’s mine!”

“No, it’s mine!” said the kid who’d stolen the bag. “It belonged to my dear, departed father.”

“It is not yours!” Jack said, furious.

“It is!” the boy shouted. “Take him to jail, Officer!”

“Stand back!” the policeman shouted at the kid. “Don’t worry, I will be puttin’ him in jail. But I might be puttin’ you there, too!”

“Jail?” said Jack.

“But, sir, it really is our bag,” said Annie. “Those two kids stole it from us, and my brother just grabbed it back and—”

“Quiet!” the policeman said. “Someone stole it—whether it’s him or him, or maybe you, we’ll soon find out.”

“But I can tell you what’s in it!” said Jack. “I can prove—”

“Quiet! You can make your case to the chief inspector at Scotland Yard!” said the policeman. “Step aside! Let us through!” he yelled at the crowd.

As the crowd parted to make a path, Jack saw the tough kid and his friend slip away down the alley. “They’re running away, sir!” he said.

But the policeman ignored him. “March!” he ordered.

Annie grabbed Jack’s hand and walked close to him. “I’m sorry,” she said, near tears. “I’m so sorry I made us give up our nice clothes.”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “You didn’t know this would happen.” He wasn’t mad at Annie. He was mad at the boys who had tried to steal his bag. And he was mad at Merlin, Teddy, and Kathleen! Why had they sent him and Annie to such a terrible place? He didn’t care at all about helping crazy Mr. Dickens anymore. He just wished they were back home in Frog Creek.

“This way!” the policeman ordered. He gave Jack a little push. Jack and Annie turned out of the alley and headed down the street. They walked through the smothering coal smoke and grimy rain.

“Left!” the policeman shouted.

Jack and Annie turned left. The crowd still followed them. Jack kept his head down. He couldn’t bear to look at the gawkers.

“Hello!” Annie suddenly shouted. “It’s us! Remember us?”

Jack looked up. Who was Annie shouting to?

Standing on the other side of the street was Mr. Dickens.

“It’s us!” Annie called again. “The chimney sweeps in your study! Remember?”

Mr. Dickens scowled, but he started to follow them, walking behind the crowd.

“Help us!” Annie shouted. “Please help us!”

“Quiet, boy!” the policeman barked at Annie.

Mr. Dickens moved briskly toward Jack and Annie, pushing his way through the crowd. “Excuse me, Officer!” he said.

The policeman stopped. He squinted at the small, well-dressed man. “Mr. Dickens? Mr. Charles Dickens?” he said with wonder.

Gasps and whispers went up from the crowd. “It’s him. It’s Charles Dickens, the writer!” the baker said.

“Yes, it is I,” said Mr. Dickens. “I know these sweeps. What seems to be the problem, Officer?”

“The boy stole this bag, sir.” The policeman held up the green velvet bag.

“When? When did he steal that bag?” asked Mr. Dickens.

“Just now, sir. I caught him trying to run off with it,” said the policeman.

“Well, I’m afraid you’re mistaken, Officer,” said Mr. Dickens. “These lads were working at my house earlier today. They had that green bag with them then.”

“Ah, did they now?” said the policeman, looking at Jack.

Jack nodded.

“This lad is innocent,” said Mr. Dickens. He turned and spoke to the crowd. “Do you see what has happened here? If I had not come along, the courts might have thrown this boy in jail for years. Why? Because he has soot on his face and holes in his shoes. How do you think this lad got so dirty? I ask all of you!”

No one in the crowd answered.

“I’ll tell you how,” said Mr. Dickens. “From honest work. And now all of you want to put this innocent, hardworking lad into prison?”

The butcher, the baker, and the cigar seller lowered their gazes. The policeman looked ashamed, too. “Mr. Dickens, forgive me. I shall release him at once,” he said.

“Yes, Officer, release this lad. Return his bag, and think twice before you arrest another child just because he is ragged and poor,” said Mr. Dickens.



The policeman handed the green velvet bag to Jack. “Your bag, boy,” he said. “Good luck on your journey through life. God bless you. And God bless you, Mr. Dickens. Good day.”

“Thank you, Officer. And one last word to all of you,” Mr. Dickens said to the crowd. “Remember, goodness dresses in rags and patches as often as it dresses in velvet and silk.”

The crowd was silent for a moment. Then some people broke into applause.

Mr. Dickens tipped his hat. He put his hands on Jack’s and Annie’s shoulders. “Come, lads. I will walk with you a ways, so no one else will prey upon you,” he said.

“Thanks,” Jack said hoarsely.

Mr. Dickens guided Jack and Annie away from the crowd. He steered them across the street.

“Thanks for helping us,” said Annie. “We’re sorry we ruined your work today. We didn’t mean to.”

“Oh, no, you didn’t ruin my work,” said Mr. Dickens. “It was just that the sudden sight of you reminded me of all the children who sweep our chimneys and work in our mines and factories. You suffer.…” He shook his head. Then he looked at them and tried to smile. “Forgive me, lads. I needn’t tell you about your own hard lives. Instead, you both must tell me about yourselves.”

“Well, first, I’m not a lad,” said Annie. “I’m a girl. My name is Annie.” She took off her cap, and her pigtails fell to her shoulders.

Mr. Dickens’s big eyes grew bigger. “Why, I am speechless!” he sputtered.

Annie shrugged. “Sorry, Mr. Dickens, but this is the real me.”

“Well—well, Annie, I’m delighted to meet the real you!” Mr. Dickens looked at Jack. “And are you also a little girl in disguise?” he asked.

“No!” said Jack. “I’m her brother, Jack.”

“I see,” said Mr. Dickens. “So you are Jack and Annie. Well! I would like it if you both called me Charles.”

“Thank you, Charles,” said Annie.

“So now, Jack and Annie, what exactly happened today with the policeman and the mob?” asked Charles.

“Tell him, Jack,” said Annie.

“No, you tell him,” said Jack. He felt too upset to talk about it.

“Okay, Charles, I’ll tell you,” said Annie.

As Annie told the story of how the boys had stolen the bag, Charles listened carefully, nodding and frowning. His eyebrows jumped up and down. His mouth twitched. He seemed to be feeling everything Annie was describing.

Finally Annie finished, saying, “And then you came, and you know the rest.”

“Remarkable!” said Charles.

“Yes, it was remarkable,” Jack said bitterly.

“No, it is remarkable because it is exactly like a scene in my book Oliver Twist!” said Charles. “Oliver is wrongly accused of picking the pocket of an old man. And the real thieves lead the chase, yelling, ‘Stop, thief!’”

“Really?” said Jack.

“Are you serious?” said Annie. “That happens in your book?”

“Indeed,” said Charles.

“Cool,” said Jack with a little smile.

“Does that make you feel better?” Annie asked Jack.

“Yeah, it does, actually,” he said. “It makes me feel like I’m not alone.”

“Good!” said Charles. “Now, tell me, Jack and Annie, are you hungry?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Of course you are!” said Charles. “I imagine you’ve had nothing but watery gruel for days! Let me treat you to a meal that you will never forget! Steak and gravy! Pork pie! Gooseberry jam! Come, we will dine like kings!” He looked at Annie. “And a queen!” he added with a wink.


7. Bah, Humbug!


Night was falling as Charles led Jack and Annie across the street to an old inn. Candles twinkled in the paned windows. Charles ushered them through the door and into a warm dining room. The room had low ceilings with dark wooden beams. A fire crackled in a huge fireplace at one end.

“Ah, Mr. Dickens, welcome! Welcome!” said a man with a pointed nose and small eyes. He bowed low and rubbed his hands together.

“Thank you, Mr. Pinch,” said Charles.

“What brings you to my humble inn today?” Mr. Pinch asked.

“I’ve come to dine with my two friends, Mr. Pinch,” said Charles.

The innkeeper looked down at Jack and Annie. He frowned at their ragged, muddy clothes. “These are your friends, Mr. Dickens?” he said. He wrinkled his nose as if he smelled something bad.

“Yes. They are hardworking children,” said Charles. “And they are quite hungry.”

“I see.…” Mr. Pinch looked fretfully around the room. “Well, what about that table in the corner, Mr. Dickens?”

“Yes, Mr. Pinch, that will be fine,” said Charles.

Mr. Pinch ushered them to the table. A waiter brought them silverware and lit a candle. Some of the diners began to notice Charles Dickens and whispered to one another.

An elegantly dressed couple came over to the table. “Excuse me, Mr. Dickens,” the woman said shyly. “But I want you to know how much my husband and I love your stories.”

“Why, thank you!” said Charles, grinning. “Tell me, what do you love most about them?”

As the couple began talking about their favorite scenes from his books, more people gathered around Charles Dickens.

At the same time, serving people delivered heaping plates of food to the table: baked apples, turkey drumsticks, steak pie, mashed potatoes, brown bread, buttery cheese, dark jam, and steaming cups of tea. Jack and Annie started to eat at once. Gobbling his mashed potatoes, Jack noticed that Charles Dickens didn’t even look at his food. He was too busy laughing and talking with his fans.

People all over London love Charles, Jack thought. So why did Merlin send us here? So far Charles was only helping them. They weren’t helping him at all.

“Jack, look,” Annie whispered. She pointed toward a window.

A man and a small boy were staring through the glass, their faces lit by candlelight. The man was leaning on a crutch. He and the boy were both thin and sad-looking.



“They’re staring at Charles,” Jack mumbled, his mouth full of potatoes.

“No, I think they’re staring at our food,” said Annie.

While Charles kept talking with his fans, Annie took a drumstick, two pieces of bread, and a chunk of cheese from her plate. She wrapped them in a napkin. Then she slipped away from the table and out the door of the inn.

Mr. Pinch cried out. He waved his hands and charged to the door. He yelled in a shrill voice, “Come back here, urchin! Where are you going with that?”

Oh, no, not again! thought Jack. He leapt up and ran to the doorway. He pushed past Mr. Pinch and stepped outside into the chilly air.

Annie was standing with the little boy and the man with the crutch. She was offering them her bundle of food.

“Don’t you dare give that food away!” cried Mr. Pinch.

“Why?” said Jack. “She’s not stealing anything. She’s giving them some of her own dinner.”

“What is happening here?” said Charles, stepping outside.

The little boy grabbed the bundle of food from Annie. “Thank you,” he said softly, and he and the man took off. The man’s crutch thumped on the pavement as he hobbled away with the boy.

“That’s right! Get out of here!” Mr. Pinch yelled after them. “No greedy mice begging at my inn! And you, urchin, you had no right to do that!”

“Mr. Pinch, from what I could tell, my young friend was only showing compassion,” said Charles.

“Bah! Foolishness!” said Mr. Pinch. “Rumors will spread now that I give away food!”

“And what harm would come of that?” Charles asked the innkeeper. “You’re rich enough. You can afford to share a bit with those less fortunate.”

“Bah, humbug!” said Mr. Pinch. “Are there no poorhouses to feed them? No workhouses? Let them eat in debtors’ prisons! The father should put the boy to work! There are plenty of factories that would hire him!”

Charles seemed unable to speak as he stared at the stingy man.

“Charles?” said Annie.

Jack didn’t know what was wrong with Charles. But he knew he should get him away from the miserable innkeeper. “Let’s leave,” he said, tugging on Charles’s sleeve. “Let’s go.”

Charles looked at Jack. “Yes … yes …,” he said absently. “Indeed.”

“Wait a second,” said Jack. He dashed back into the warm dining room and grabbed his green velvet bag. On his way out, he noticed that everyone had gone back to their dinners. They were eating and talking, their lives untouched by the sad events outside.

Jack joined Charles and Annie on the street. “All set,” he said.

“Mr. Dickens? Please!” Mr. Pinch whined from the doorway. “Pay me before you leave? Please, sir?”

“Yes. Yes … of course.” Charles pulled out his wallet and paid the innkeeper.

Mr. Pinch smiled. “You understand, don’t you, sir?” he said. “It’s not my job to feed all of England.”

“No. Of course it isn’t,” said Charles. Then he walked away from the inn. Jack and Annie followed him.

It was colder and darker now. Brownish fog shrouded the street. A lamplighter was lighting the streetlamps.

“Are you okay, Charles?” asked Annie.

Charles barely nodded. “Yes—uh—did you children get enough to eat?” he said.

“Yes, thank you,” said Annie. “We’re fine. But are you all right?”

“Me?” He let out a long, shaky sigh. “Sorry, but I—I must leave you now,” he said. “Here.” Charles pulled out his wallet again. “Take this. I want you to buy new boots and a week’s worth of food. I’m sorry to leave you, but I must.” His hands shook as he held out the leather wallet.

“No, we can’t,” said Jack.

“I insist,” said Charles, giving him the wallet. “Thank you for your company. And bless you both.” Charles Dickens then walked away from them, disappearing into the brown fog.



8. A Terrible Story

“What do you think is wrong with him?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. He put the wallet in his bag. “But so far our mission’s been a disaster.”

“Well, we can’t give up now,” said Annie. “Come on, let’s follow him.”

As Jack and Annie started after Charles, the street was quiet and empty. It seemed the blinding fog and damp drizzle had driven everyone inside.

They hadn’t gone far before Charles looked back and saw them. “Don’t follow me, children!” he called. “Please! I want to be alone now! I must be alone.”

Jack and Annie watched Charles vanish into the mist.

“Maybe we should go back,” Jack said. “We could find our way to his house and wait for him there.”

“Something tells me he’s not going home soon,” said Annie. “I feel like he really needs our help now.”

Jack sighed. “Yeah, I feel that way, too,” he said. “So let’s follow him. But we’d better keep a safe distance from him, so he doesn’t see us.”

As Jack and Annie followed Charles through the fog, they could hear the tapping of his walking stick on the cobblestones. They followed the sound down a sloping street lined with shacks.

In the dingy light of the gas streetlamps, Jack could see garbage in the gutters—cabbage leaves, moldy bread, rotten fish. The poor neighborhood frightened him. But he and Annie kept going, following the sounds of Charles’s footsteps and the tapping of his walking stick.

Then the sounds stopped.

“Wait,” Jack whispered.

Jack and Annie froze. They couldn’t see Charles through the fog, but they could hear the sound of sobbing.

“Oh, no!” whispered Annie.

Jack and Annie moved closer to the sound. Charles was sitting under a streetlamp at the bottom of the hill. His head was resting in the crook of his arm.

“Charles?” said Annie. She stepped closer to Charles. “Are you okay?” Annie sat on the curb next to him.

Jack sat on the other side of Charles. “You want to talk about it?” he asked.

Charles lifted his head. “I’m sorry. I’ve never told anyone this story before,” he said. “Not even my wife or my closest friends.”

“You can tell us,” said Jack.

Charles looked at Jack, then at Annie. He stood and motioned for them to join him. Then he pointed into the fog. “Over there, near the river, was once a shoe polish factory. It was a tumbledown old building, filled with river rats. I went to work there when I was twelve. I sat at a table, pasting labels onto pots of black polish. I worked eleven hours a day, six days a week, yet I barely earned enough to keep alive.”

“You were only twelve?” said Jack.



“Yes. And I lived alone. I had lost everything—my family, my school, my dignity,” said Charles.

“Were you an orphan?” asked Annie.

“No. I had parents,” said Charles.

“Why did they make you work in such a bad place?” asked Jack.

“My father had fallen on hard times,” said Charles. “He was a good man, but he couldn’t pay his bills. So he was sent to a debtors’ prison across the river. My mother chose to live there with him.”

“That’s a terrible story,” said Annie.

“Wait a minute,” said Jack. “You mean your dad was sent to prison because he couldn’t pay his bills?”

“Yes,” said Charles.

“That doesn’t make sense,” said Jack. “How could he earn the money to pay his bills if he was in prison?”

“That’s a very good question,” said Charles.

“That doesn’t happen anymore,” said Jack, thinking of life back in Frog Creek.

“Oh, yes, it does,” said Charles. “Life is still miserable for thousands of poor. Parents live in prisons and workhouses, while countless children work in factories and mines for pennies.”

“But at least things are different for you now,” said Annie. “You’re a famous writer. That should make you feel better.”

“How can that make me feel better?” said Charles. “What is writing? Just ink on a page. It’s not food for the hungry. It’s not medicine for the sick. Lately I’ve been thinking I should give up my writing altogether.”

“Oh, no,” said Jack. “You can’t do that.”

“It seems so foolish and vain,” said Charles.

“But—” said Jack.

“No,” said Charles. He let out a shuddering sigh. “I have decided: I shall write no more.”

“Charles, what about—” said Annie.

“Be kind, children, and leave me now,” said Charles. “I need to be alone. My heart dies inside of me.”

“Oh. Okay …,” said Annie. She and Jack stood up. “Bye, Charles …”

Jack started to wish Charles good luck, but the words stuck in his throat. There was really nothing to say. As Charles covered his face in despair, Jack and Annie started back up the hill.

“We can’t just leave him,” said Jack.

“I know. So let’s stay nearby,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie found a stoop to sit on, and they watched over the lonely figure at the bottom of the hill.

“Now I know why Merlin sent us here,” said Jack. “But this really seems hopeless.”

“Look in our research book,” said Annie. “Maybe it can help us.”

Jack pulled out their book and looked up Charles Dickens again. He read aloud:

Charles Dickens was born in England in 1812. He is one of the most famous writers of all time. He wrote many novels, including Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, and—



“Wait, wait,” said Annie. “A Christmas Carol? Wasn’t that the name of the play we saw last year with Mom and Dad and Grandma?”

“Yeah,” said Jack, “on Christmas Eve. Oh, man, that’s why the name Charles Dickens sounded familiar.”

“Look, there’s a picture of Scrooge, the mean guy in the play,” said Annie. She pointed to a picture in the book. It showed an old man wearing a nightcap and holding a candle.

Jack read the caption underneath:

A Christmas Carol has been retold again and again in plays, movies, and television shows. To this day, it inspires people to be kinder and more generous to others.



“Wow, remember the three ghosts who visit Mr. Scrooge?” said Jack. “The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Future.”

“Right. They try to change him by showing him his past, his present, and his future,” said Annie. “At the end of the story, he’s like a different person. I can’t believe Charles wrote that story!”

“Well, now it seems like he won’t,” said Jack. “He just said he’s never going to write again. He said his heart has died.”

Annie stood up and brushed herself off. “So get out the violin and the bow,” she said matter-of-factly.

“Oh, I forgot all about our magic violin!” said Jack.

“Me too, until now,” said Annie. “Get it out. I’ll make up a song.”

“What kind of song?” asked Jack.

“I’ll make up my own version of A Christmas Carol,” said Annie. “But it won’t be a story about Scrooge. It’ll be a story about Charles—a ghost story about Charles Dickens.”


9. The Three Ghosts


“A ghost story?” said Jack. “You mean we’ll make ghosts appear?”

“Yep,” said Annie.

“Um … I don’t know,” said Jack. Ghosts made him nervous.

“I promise this will work,” said Annie.

“But I don’t get it,” said Jack. “A ghost story. How can we change Charles with that?”

“We won’t change him. The ghosts will change him, just like they changed Scrooge,” said Annie. “Our job is just to make the right ghosts appear.”

“But—” started Jack.

“It’s magic, Jack,” said Annie. “We have to trust the magic.”

“But Charles doesn’t even want us around,” said Jack.

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “He doesn’t have to see us. He can believe it’s all happening in his imagination. He has a great imagination, you know. Come on, before he leaves.”

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “But I hope we don’t give him a heart attack.” He unbuckled the green velvet bag and pulled out the violin and the bow.

Jack rested the bow against the strings of the violin. Then he began moving the bow back and forth. The violin’s music was soft at first, but as it grew louder, it seemed to come from every direction.

At the bottom of the hill, Charles lifted his head.

Annie started singing in a soft, whispery voice:

Come, three ghosts,

in a dreamlike swirl.

Help our friend

give his gifts to the world.



The streetlamp flickered and went out. Then a hazy glow surrounded Charles. He stood up and looked around. In the haze, a ghostly figure swirled into shape.

Jack’s heart pounded as he kept playing.

Charles cried out and stumbled back.

The ghost looked like both a child and an old man. He had long white hair, but there was not a wrinkle on his face. He wore a white tunic with a silver belt and carried a holly branch in his hand.

Annie sang on:

Do not fear him, Charles,

stand fast.

He’s come to share

a Christmas Past.



The ghost waved his hand, and a scene slowly appeared in the glowing fog: a small, frail boy was lying on a heap of rags.

“Who are you? And why do you show me this poor child?” cried Charles.

The boy rolled over and sat up. He had big eyes and wavy brown hair.

Charles gasped. “Oh, my!” he said. “Is that … is that me?”

The boy reached under the rags and pulled out a book. On the cover was a picture of a flying carpet. The boy opened the book and smiled.



“I remember that book! It is me!” cried Charles. “I loved to read The Arabian Nights! I felt as if I could ride on a flying carpet myself! Books gave me hope when I had no hope. But why do you show me this now?”

The ghost did not answer. He raised his pale hand in farewell.

“Wait!” cried Charles.

But the ghost faded into the haze. And the vision of young Charles Dickens faded with him.

The glow still surrounded Charles. Jack’s violin music swelled with deep tones. Annie sang on.

Come to Charles,

O second ghost.

It’s your turn now

to be the host.…



The haze became rose-colored. It swirled in the shape of a small cyclone. The funnel of vapor spun wider and wider, until out from its center stepped a giant in a green robe. He had a bushy brown beard and wore a crown of icicles. He held a flaming torch high into the air.

“Who are you? What do you want with me?” cried Charles.

The ghost pointed into the mist and bellowed:

You say you’ll write

not one more book?

Stop your weeping, man,

and look!



Charles stared as human shapes began to form in the mist: a young Victorian couple stood at a bookstall. “I’m getting the new book by Charles Dickens! I love Mr. Dickens!”

“I know you do, my dear! And so do I!”

The couple laughed joyfully, and another scene appeared beside them: a teacher stood in front of schoolchildren. “So what did we learn today from Mr. Dickens’s book?” she asked.

“We learned to be more generous and kind!” a small girl answered.

“Yes!” the class shouted.

As the children cheered, another scene took shape: Queen Victoria was sitting on her throne!

“I say,” the queen said to a lady-in-waiting. “This Oliver Twist book is exceedingly interesting. Poor Oliver. I had no idea children in our kingdom lived such dreadful lives.”

The queen faded away. The couple faded away—and the teacher and the children. Everything faded away except the giant ghost.

“They were all speaking about my books,” Charles said in a voice filled with wonder.

The giant ghost boomed:

Yet writing is nothing

but paper and ink!

A foolish task!

Is that not what you think?



“Yes! No! Yes, but …,” said Charles.

The ghost shook his head sadly. Then he, too, vanished into the fog.

Annie sang on:

Think about all

you’ve been shown by this ghost,

and get ready to meet

your last ghostly host.



The rosy glow faded to an eerie silver light. The air grew very cold. Then, like a dark shadow, a third ghost silently appeared. This ghost wore a black cape with the hood pulled over its head.

Charles raised his walking stick to protect himself. Jack trembled with cold and fear, but he kept playing the violin.

The ghost glided slowly toward Charles.

“Who are you? What do you want?” Charles cried.

A scene swirled into view beside the ghost: a group of people stood in a graveyard. A young woman was weeping near a tombstone.

“Why—why do you show me this scene of grief?” asked Charles.

The ghost pointed a bony finger at the tombstone.

Charles lowered his walking stick and crept closer. He squinted at the writing on the tombstone. He gasped. “It’s my name!” he cried. “My name is on that stone!”



“Poor Papa,” the young woman said to the other mourners. “How sad that he stopped writing when he was so young. So many beautiful words might have been written. So many wonderful characters might have lived. If only he’d given more stories to the world, he might have touched the hearts of millions.” The woman broke down in tears again.

“Stop! Stop!” cried Charles. “I can’t bear it!”

The scene began to fade.

“Wait!” Charles shouted to the ghost. “I’ve changed my mind! Tell her I will keep writing! Wait!”

But the ghost and the mourners and the tombstone had already disappeared into the fog. Charles Dickens stood alone in the cold silver light.

Jack played one long, low note on the magic violin.

Then there was silence.


10. A Christmas Carol


The gas streetlamp flickered back on. Charles began pacing back and forth.

“Come on, Jack,” said Annie. “Let’s go talk to him! Quick!”

Jack packed up the violin and bow. Then he and Annie hurried down the hill to Charles.

“Charles!” cried Annie. “Hello!”

Charles whirled around. “Annie! Jack! You can’t imagine what just happened!” His voice was shaking. “I had the strangest visions! Three ghosts came to me! They showed me visions of myself in the past, the present, and the future!”

“Really?” said Annie. “That sounds like a scene in a book.”

“Yes, yes, it certainly does!” Charles said, laughing and wiping his eyes. “The ghosts made me want to keep writing. They taught me that I can truly help the world with my books! I—I must go home! I must find a cab and go home and get to work at once! I cannot waste another day! Another hour! Another minute! I must write! I love to write!” He laughed with joy.

“Then I guess we’ll be going home, too,” said Jack, smiling. “Our job is done here.”

“Shall I tell the cab to let you off somewhere?” asked Charles.

“We need to go to Hyde Park,” said Annie.

“Wonderful! It’s on the way. Come along!” said Charles. He took off running up the hill, dashing ahead of Jack and Annie. When they caught up with him, they saw a horse and cab clattering over the cobblestones.

“Stop, sir! Give us a ride, please!” Charles shouted to the driver.

The driver brought his horse to a halt. Jack and Annie followed Charles to the cab. “Hyde Park! Then One Devonshire Terrace! Please hurry!” said Charles.

The driver looked delighted. “Yes, Mr. Dickens, sir!” he said.

The three of them crowded into the cab, and the horse began to trot through the dark, foggy city, its hooves clopping on the cobblestones.

“Ah!” said Charles, clapping his hands. “I know now what I shall write about! I will write a Christmas story about a man whose life is changed by three ghosts! The Ghost of Christmas Past! The Ghost of Christmas Present! And the Ghost of Christmas Future! What do you think of that?”

“It sounds brilliant,” said Jack.

“I agree!” said Charles. “I’ll write about a greedy, selfish man who helps no one. Like—like Mr. Pinch! But I’ll call him—what shall I call him?”

“How about Scrooge?” said Annie.

“Wonderful name!” Charles laughed. “Mr. Scrooge! I love it. The three ghosts will change Scrooge’s life! Do you like that idea?”

“Love it,” said Jack.

“Good!” said Charles. “I think I shall just be able to write the story in time for Christmas. Hah! Perhaps I’ll call it A Ghost Story of Christmas.”

“Hmm. Or maybe you could just call it A Christmas Carol,” said Jack.

“Oh! I love that!” said Charles. “Yes, perhaps I’ll call it A Christmas Carol. And then underneath those words, I’ll write: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas!”

“That sounds good,” said Annie.

“That should make people want to read it,” said Charles. “Everyone loves a ghost story, don’t they?”

“Well …,” started Jack.

“Of course they do!” said Charles. “It all makes sense to me now. I will keep using my books to fight greed and cruelty. My pen is my sword. Except my books will never celebrate wars and fighting. They’ll always show the joys and sorrows of real people. They’ll show how good always triumphs over evil.”

“Great,” said Jack.

Charles sat back in his carriage seat and chuckled, his eyes shining in the lamplight. “I’m as light as a feather, as happy as an angel. Am I not the luckiest man on earth?”

“I think you might be,” said Annie.

The horse came to a stop. “Hyde Park, Mr. Dickens, sir,” the driver called down.



“Well, Jack and Annie, I hope you have enjoyed your time with me. I trust I have been of some help to you,” said Charles. He sounded like the old Charles, pleased and proud of himself.

Jack didn’t mind. A happy Charles was much better than a sad one.

“Yes,” said Jack. “But we have to give this back to you.” He pulled out the leather wallet that Charles had given them. “Thanks, but we don’t need it.”

“Oh, no, please keep it,” said Charles. “Buy food with the money. Buy boots. Buy books!”

“Actually, we have lots of books,” said Jack. “And we have food at home and shoes and parents. We have everything we need.”

“Charles, please share it with others who aren’t so lucky,” said Annie.

“Why, I don’t know what to say,” said Charles. “You two are the most extraordinary children I’ve ever met. Clearly you have good, generous hearts. You already live the message I want to write in A Christmas Carol.”

Annie smiled. “Yeah, well, it’s always good to be reminded,” she said. “I can’t wait to read your story.”

“And where will you go now?” asked Charles. “Will you be safe?”

“Yes, our parents take good care of us,” said Jack. “You don’t have to worry.”

“I shall never forget you,” said Charles.

“We won’t forget you, either,” said Annie. “Good-bye, Charles.”

Jack and Annie hopped down from the cab and took off through the park. The fog was so thick it was impossible to see the tree house. Jack couldn’t even see Annie. He was relieved when she called out, “I found it!”

Jack ran toward the sound of Annie’s voice. She was already halfway up the ladder. As he started up after her, church bells began to bong, striking the hour.

Jack and Annie climbed inside the tree house and looked out the window. But there was nothing to see, nothing except the heavy fog.

“Charles is going to be fine,” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack with a smile. “He never even knew that it was us who helped him.”

“That’s the best way to help someone, I think,” said Annie.

“Why?” asked Jack.

“Then you know you’re not helping them just to get a lot of credit,” said Annie. “You’re helping because it’s the right thing to do.”

Jack nodded. What Annie had just said felt true. “Ready to go home now?” he said. He picked up the Pennsylvania book.

Annie nodded.

Jack pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


11. Gifts to the World


No time at all had passed in Frog Creek. The sky was lit by the orange afterglow of the sunset. Jack and Annie were wearing their jeans and jackets and sneakers again. The green velvet bag had changed back into Jack’s backpack.

“Jack! Annie!” two voices called from the woods below.

Jack and Annie looked out the window. Teddy and Kathleen stood in the shadows beneath them!

“Hi! Hi!” Annie and Jack called. They quickly climbed down the rope ladder and hopped to the ground.

“We’re glad to see you!” said Annie. “Why are you here?”

Before Teddy or Kathleen could answer, the leaves rustled, and out from the dark trees stepped Morgan le Fay and Merlin the magician.

“Morgan! Merlin!” said Annie.

Peep.

“Penny!” said Jack.

Waddling behind Merlin was the baby penguin Jack and Annie had given to Merlin after their trip to Antarctica.

Peep.

Kathleen picked up Penny and held the little penguin in her arms.

Peep. Peep.

Jack and Annie laughed. “How are you, Penny?” asked Jack.

“She is wonderful,” said Morgan. “She is dearly loved in Camelot. I would say Penny has become the very heart of our kingdom.”

“She hasn’t gotten any bigger,” said Jack.

Merlin smiled. “Time passes very slowly in Camelot,” he said.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “Camelot has hardly aged at all since we last saw you.”

“But you have accomplished much in that time,” said Merlin. “You have completed your missions to help four artists give their gifts to the world.”

“And from all we hear,” said Morgan, “you were as successful with Charles Dickens as you were with Lady Augusta Gregory, Louis Armstrong, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.”

“I guess we were,” Jack said modestly.

“I loved Charles,” said Annie. “I loved all of them. I felt like we became good friends with them.”

“Yeah, and I’m really sad that I won’t see them again,” said Jack.

“We thought you might feel that way,” said Kathleen.

“Merlin and Morgan have something to show you,” said Teddy.

“But first, may we have the magic violin and bow back?” asked Kathleen.

“Oh, sure,” said Jack. He reached into his backpack and pulled out the violin and bow.

Teddy took the violin from him, and Kathleen took the bow. “On your last four missions, you played a magic violin, a magic Irish whistle, a magic trumpet, and a magic flute,” said Kathleen.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Do you remember where the magic came from?” said Kathleen. She tossed the violin bow into the air. It was still for a moment. Then it began to twirl around and around. There was a flash of blue light. The violin and bow disappeared. Floating in the air was an object shaped like the spiraled horn of a unicorn.

“The Wand of Dianthus!” Jack and Annie said together.

“Yes,” said Kathleen. She plucked the wand from the air and handed it to Merlin.

Merlin closed his eyes. He waved the Wand of Dianthus in a circle and whispered words Jack couldn’t understand.

There was a whoosh of wind, and they were all standing at the corner of Jack and Annie’s street. Some people were walking by in the dusk. Jack looked worriedly at Merlin, Morgan, Teddy, Kathleen, and Penny. What would people say when they saw them?

“Do not worry,” Morgan said, as if she could read Jack’s mind. “They see and hear only you and Annie.”

“Listen carefully,” said Merlin.

Jack listened. Beautiful music was coming from a house on the corner.

“A string quartet is rehearsing for a Mozart concert at a church this Saturday,” said Merlin.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie.

Merlin waved the wand in a circle and whispered more magic words.

Whoosh! They were all standing outside a window of a large brick building. Inside, kids were playing trumpets, saxophones, and drums. “Hey, it’s the band room at the middle school,” Jack said.

“Yes, the band is rehearsing a Louis Armstrong song for the jazz festival next week,” said Morgan.

Again Merlin waved the wand in a circle and whispered magic words. Whoosh! They all stood at a window of a white wooden building. “It’s the Frog Creek library!” said Annie. Inside the library, a woman sat in an armchair, talking and waving her hands. Children sat at her feet, listening.

“A storyteller is telling Irish folktales,” said Kathleen. “Stories collected by Augusta Gregory.”

Merlin waved the wand in a circle and whispered magic words again. Whoosh! They were all standing at the back of a dark auditorium. Actors were rehearsing on the stage.

“Back by popular demand,” Teddy whispered, “the Frog Creek Little Theater presents Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol.”

“Yay! We can go see it again,” whispered Annie.

“Yes. And that is how you will visit with Charles Dickens again,” said Merlin.

“Charles Dickens, Lady Augusta Gregory, Louis Armstrong, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and all other great artists live on through their work,” said Morgan.

“You put your four friends on the path to giving their gifts to the world,” said Kathleen.

“And the world still receives their gifts,” said Teddy.

“You accomplished your mission,” Merlin said to Jack and Annie. “Thank you for helping bring happiness to millions.”

“You’re welcome,” said Jack.

“No problem,” said Annie.

Jack turned back to watch the rehearsal of A Christmas Carol.

The Ghost of Christmas Future had just left the stage, and Scrooge was alone in his bedroom. The actor playing Scrooge started hopping about, laughing and crying in the same breath. “I am as light as a feather!” he shouted. “I am as happy as an angel!”

Jack and Annie laughed at Scrooge’s wild joy. Jack turned around to laugh with the others. But they were gone. Merlin, Morgan, Teddy, Kathleen, and Penny had all vanished.

“Where …?” Jack said.

“They must’ve gone home to Camelot,” said Annie. “But I’ll bet we’ll see them again soon.”

Jack nodded. “We should go home now, too,” he said.

As Scrooge was shouting “Merry Christmas!” to the world, Jack and Annie slipped out of the Frog Creek Little Theater. Then they ran through the cool autumn evening, heading for home.


More Facts About Charles Dickens


In the autumn of 1843, the young writer Charles Dickens was greatly disturbed by the plight of England’s poor people. He was especially worried about children, as he was haunted by his own memories of being a desperately poor child. Seeking guidance and inspiration, he often took twilight walks through some of London’s worst neighborhoods.

One evening on a walk, Dickens came up with the idea of writing A Christmas Carol in Prose: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, as he subtitled it. The story included a miserly man named Scrooge, a small child known as Tiny Tim, and three Christmas ghosts. Dickens wrote feverishly and finished his ghost story by early December. It was quickly published and sold out its first six thousand copies.

A Christmas Carol has since become one of the world’s best-loved stories. Written at a time when Christmas traditions were on the decline, it is often credited with reviving holiday customs and encouraging families to gather together during the Christmas season and to be more generous toward those less fortunate.

After writing A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens went on to create many other great works, including David Copperfield, Bleak House, and Great Expectations. During the Victorian age, his books not only brought people great pleasure, but helped inspire Britain to make many reforms to improve conditions for the poor.

“The weather’s getting warmer,” said Jack. He and Annie were walking home from school under a cloudless May sky. A warm breeze blew the newly green trees that lined their street.

“I love it,” said Annie. “It makes me feel like something good’s going to happen.”

“Something good already happened,” said Jack. “My teacher finally gave back my story today.”

“The one about our adventures in the tree house?” asked Annie.

“Yep. She said I have a fantastic imagination,” said Jack.

“Great!” said Annie.

“And she loved your drawings for the story, too,” said Jack. “She said you’re really talented.”

“That’s nice!” said Annie. “Maybe she loved the sparkle pens I used.”

“Yeah, the only thing she didn’t love was the type I chose,” said Jack. “She said it was hard to read because it was too fancy.”

“I really like that curly type,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “But it’s no big deal—she still gave me an A plus.”

“Wow, cool,” said Annie.

As they reached the edge of the Frog Creek woods, a gust of wind shook the tree branches. Jack’s baseball cap blew off. He grabbed his cap from the sidewalk. The wind blew harder.

“What’s happening?” said Annie.

Suddenly two figures rushed out of the woods. Their dark cloaks flapped behind them as they hurried toward Jack and Annie.

“Teddy!” said Annie.

“Kathleen!” said Jack.

The red-haired teenage boy and the beautiful girl with dark wavy hair ran to Jack and Annie and hugged them.

“You must come with us to the tree house!” said Kathleen. “Hurry!”

“Why? What’s up?” said Jack.

“We’ll explain when we get there!” said Teddy. He and Kathleen turned and started back into the woods. As Jack and Annie raced after them, sunlight slanted through the leafy treetops.

Soon they all came to the tallest oak tree. “Up, up!” cried Teddy.

One by one, Teddy, Kathleen, Jack, and Annie scrambled up the rope ladder and climbed into the magic tree house. When they were all inside, Teddy heaved a sigh. “My friends, we desperately need your help,” he said.

“What’s wrong?” asked Annie.

“We made a terrible mistake!” said Kathleen.

“No, it was me, just me,” said Teddy. “I made the mistake.”

“What did you do?” said Jack.

“I turned Penny into a stone statue,” said Teddy.

“Penny?” said Annie. “A statue?”

“Oh, no,” said Jack. He loved the little orphan penguin that he and Annie had found on one of their adventures. Penny had helped save Merlin’s life.

“It was an accident,” said Kathleen.

“It was stupidity!” said Teddy. “We were in Morgan’s library, and I was looking at spells in her books. Morgan forbids us to try any spells on our own, but I disobeyed when I found a simple one that turns things into stone. I thought I’d just give it a quick try—I turned an apple, a goblet of water, and a writing quill all to stone!”

“Teddy was pointing at a walking stick by the doorway, reciting the words of the spell,” said Kathleen. “And just as he finished, Penny wandered in, and the spell hit her!”

“And now she’s a stone statue,” Teddy said miserably.

“That’s terrible,” said Annie.

“Well, can’t you just ask Merlin or Morgan to use their magic to bring Penny back to life?” asked Jack.

“No, no, they must never learn anything about this! If they do, I …,” said Teddy. He shook his head and looked away.

“Merlin and Morgan are both in Avalon for the Festival of May,” said Kathleen. “If they discover what Teddy has done, we fear Merlin will banish him from the kingdom.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“Yes, Merlin will be enraged,” said Kathleen. “Penny is the very heart of our kingdom. We all love her very much.”

“Me too,” said Jack. He thought about the penguin’s fuzzy head, the funny way she peeped, the way she loved and trusted everyone.

“The good news is that we have found a rhyme that tells us how to reverse the stone spell,” said Kathleen. She took a note from her cloak.

“The bad news is that it is written in an ancient language,” said Teddy. “We have only translated eight lines so far.”

Kathleen read from the note:

Ye say that ye wish

your spell be reversed?

Four things ye must find.

Here is the first:

In the shape of a rose

is an emerald stone

that uncovers the heart

of one who’s alone.



“An emerald stone shaped like a rose?” said Jack. He took the note from Kathleen and looked at it. “That’s what you have to find first?”

“Yes, only we must spend our time trying to translate the rest of the spell before Merlin and Morgan return,” said Kathleen, “so we need you and Annie to look for the emerald rose.”

“Got it,” said Jack.

“Where do we look?” asked Annie.

“We’ve done some research,” said Teddy, “and we think you should go back almost four hundred years before your time and visit one of the Great Moguls of India.”

“Great Moguls?” said Annie.

“They are the emperors who ruled India’s Mogul Empire,” said Teddy. “One of them had the largest collection of precious gems in all the world.”

“And his stonecutters cut many of his jewels into the shape of leaves and flowers!” said Kathleen.

“Perfect!” said Annie.

“Our research says he often gave gifts of his precious gems to visiting ambassadors,” said Teddy. “You will have to pretend to be ambassadors.”

“And I’m afraid, Annie, that you will have to pretend to be a boy again,” said Kathleen. “In Mogul India, girls were not allowed to show their faces in public.”

“No problem, I’m getting used to it,” Annie said.

“Wait, even if Annie’s a boy, they’re probably not going to believe that we’re ambassadors,” said Jack.

Teddy and Kathleen gave each other blank looks. “I do not know why not,” said Teddy, “though I admit we do not really know very much about ambassadors.”

“They’re people who visit other countries to represent their own country,” said Jack.

“Splendid!” said Teddy. “So that’s what you’ll do—you’ll represent Frog Creek four hundred years ago.”

“Except ambassadors are usually grown-ups,” said Jack.

“Oh. Well. I suppose you must just do the best you can,” said Kathleen.

“Perhaps this will help you,” said Teddy. “If you have knowledge, you will seem older.” He reached into his cloak and pulled out a book.

“And we thought perhaps some magic might help, too,” said Kathleen, “if you find yourselves in danger.” She reached into her cloak again and pulled out a tiny blue bottle. “A potion to make you very small.”

“Wow, great!” said Annie.

“Uh … very small?” said Jack. He remembered how their friend Augusta had been made tiny by the fairies of Ireland. He remembered he’d been afraid it might happen to them, too. All kinds of ordinary things could seem huge and scary, he thought. “How long would we stay small?” he asked.

“It depends on how many sips you take,” said Kathleen, giving the bottle to Jack. “One sip will make you small for ten minutes, two for twenty, three for thirty, and so on.”

“Thanks,” he said. He put the bottle and the rhyme into his backpack.

“Go now,” said Teddy. “Try to find the emerald rose while we try to translate the rest of the spell.”

“We’ll do our best,” said Annie.

“Thank you,” said Kathleen. “When you need strength, just think of Penny.”

“We will,” said Jack. He took a deep breath and pointed at the cover of their research book. “I wish we could go there!”

“See you later!” said Annie.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

The hottest day of my life was also the day I saw the most beautiful building of my life. Many years ago, friends and I rode for months in a van, traveling through Asia. When we arrived in Agra, India, the heat was so unbearable I could barely think or move. A tour guide led us around to see the sights, and late in the afternoon, we arrived at one of the wonders of the world: the Taj Mahal.

When I got out of the van, I forgot all about the heat. I felt as if I had stepped from the real world into a dream. Through the heat waves, a twenty-story marble building shimmered in the pink twilight. The Taj Mahal was the tomb of a Mogul queen named Mumtãz Mahal, built by her grieving husband, Shah Jahãn, in the 1600s.

Since that day, I’ve always wanted to go back to the Taj Mahal. In this book, traveling with Jack and Annie, I finally have.

Thanks for joining us.

For Nikita, Kumar, and Susan






Only let this one teardrop, the Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time, forever and ever.

—Rabindranath Tagore,

Nobel laureate poet from West Bengal





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. It was filled with books. A boy named Jack and his sister, Annie, soon discovered that the tree house was magic, and just by pointing at a book, they could go to any time and any place in history. And while they were gone, no time at all passed back in Frog Creek.

Jack and Annie eventually found out that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot. They have since traveled on many adventures in the magic tree house and have completed many missions for both Morgan le Fay and Merlin the magician. On these journeys, they’ve often received help from two young enchanters from Camelot named Teddy and Kathleen.

Now Jack and Annie are waiting to hear about where they will be going next—for their forty-fifth adventure in the magic tree house.



1. A Terrible Mistake

“The weather’s getting warmer,” said Jack. He and Annie were walking home from school under a cloudless May sky. A warm breeze blew through the leaves on the newly green trees.

“I love it,” said Annie. “It makes me feel like something good’s going to happen.”

“Something good already happened,” said Jack. “My teacher finally gave back my story today.”

“The one about our adventures in the tree house?” asked Annie.

“Yep. She said I have a fantastic imagination,” said Jack.

“Great!” said Annie.

“And she loved your drawings for the story, too,” said Jack. “She said you’re really talented.”

“That’s nice!” said Annie. “Maybe she loved the sparkle pens I used.”

“The only thing she didn’t love was the type I chose,” said Jack. “She said it was hard to read because it was too fancy.”

“I really like that curly type,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack. “But it’s no big deal—she still gave me an A plus.”

“Wow, cool,” said Annie.

As they reached the edge of the Frog Creek woods, a gust of wind shook the tree branches. Jack’s baseball cap blew off. He grabbed his cap from the sidewalk. The wind blew harder.

“What’s happening?” said Annie.

Suddenly two figures rushed out of the woods. Their dark cloaks flapped behind them as they hurried toward Jack and Annie.

“Teddy!” said Annie.

“Kathleen!” said Jack.

The red-haired teenage boy and the beautiful girl with dark wavy hair ran to Jack and Annie and hugged them.

“You must come with us to the tree house!” said Kathleen. “Hurry!”

“Why? What’s up?” said Jack.

“We’ll explain when we get there!” said Teddy. He and Kathleen turned and started back into the woods. As Jack and Annie raced after them, sunlight slanted through the leafy treetops.

Soon they all came to the tallest oak tree. “Up, up!” cried Teddy.

One by one, Teddy, Kathleen, Jack, and Annie scrambled up the rope ladder and climbed into the magic tree house. When they were all inside, Teddy heaved a sigh. “My friends, we desperately need your help,” he said.

“What’s wrong?” asked Annie.

“We made a terrible mistake!” said Kathleen.

“No, it was me, just me,” said Teddy. “I made the mistake.”

“What did you do?” said Jack.

“I turned Penny into a stone statue,” said Teddy.

“Penny?” said Annie. “A statue?”

“Oh, no,” said Jack. He loved the little orphan penguin that he and Annie had found on one of their adventures. Penny had helped save Merlin’s life.

“It was an accident,” said Kathleen.

“It was stupidity!” said Teddy. “We were in Morgan’s library, and I was looking at spells in her books. Morgan forbids us to try any spells on our own, but I disobeyed when I found a simple one that turns things into stone. I thought I’d just give it a quick try—I turned an apple, a goblet of water, and a writing quill all to stone!”

“Teddy was pointing at a walking stick by the doorway, reciting the words of the spell,” said Kathleen. “And just as he finished, Penny wandered in, and the spell hit her!”

“And now she’s a stone statue,” Teddy said miserably.

“That’s terrible,” said Annie.

“Well, can’t you just ask Merlin or Morgan to use their magic to bring Penny back to life?” asked Jack.

“No, no, they must never learn anything about this! If they do, I …” Teddy shook his head and looked away.

“Merlin and Morgan are both in Avalon for the Festival of May,” said Kathleen. “If they discover what Teddy has done, we fear Merlin will banish him from the kingdom.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“Yes, Merlin will be enraged,” said Kathleen. “Penny is the very heart of our kingdom. We all love her very much.”

“Me too,” said Jack. He thought about the penguin’s fuzzy head, the funny way she peeped, the way she loved and trusted everyone.

“The good news is that we have found a rhyme that tells us how to reverse the stone spell,” said Kathleen. She took a note from her cloak.

“The bad news is that it is written in an ancient language,” said Teddy. “We have only translated eight lines so far.”

Kathleen read from the note:

Ye say that ye wish

your spell be reversed?

Four things ye must find.

Here is the first:



In the shape of a rose

is an emerald stone

that uncovers the heart

of one who’s alone.



“An emerald stone shaped like a rose?” said Jack. He took the note from Kathleen and looked at it. “That’s what you have to find first?”

“Yes, only we must spend our time trying to translate the rest of the spell before Merlin and Morgan return,” said Kathleen, “so we need you and Annie to look for the emerald rose.”

“Got it,” said Jack.

“Where do we look?” asked Annie.

“We have done some research,” said Teddy, “and we think you should go back almost four hundred years and visit one of the Great Moguls of India.”

“Great Moguls?” said Annie.

“They are the emperors who ruled India’s Mogul Empire,” said Teddy. “One of them had the largest collection of precious gems in all the world.”

“And his stonecutters cut many of his jewels into the shape of leaves and flowers!” said Kathleen.

“Perfect!” said Annie.

“Our research says he often gave gifts of his precious gems to visiting ambassadors,” said Teddy. “You will have to pretend to be ambassadors.”

“And I am afraid, Annie, that you will have to pretend to be a boy again,” said Kathleen. “In Mogul India, girls were not allowed to show their faces in public.”

“No problem, I’m getting used to it,” Annie said.

“Wait, even if Annie’s a boy, they’re probably not going to believe that we’re ambassadors,” said Jack.

Teddy and Kathleen gave each other blank looks. “I do not know why not,” said Teddy, “though I admit we do not really know very much about ambassadors.”

“They’re people who visit other countries to represent their own country,” said Jack.

“Splendid!” said Teddy. “So that’s what you’ll do—you’ll represent Frog Creek four hundred years ago.”

“Except ambassadors are usually grown-ups,” said Jack.

“Oh. Well. I suppose you must just do the best you can,” said Kathleen.

“Perhaps this will help you,” said Teddy. “If you have knowledge, you will seem older.” He reached into his cloak and pulled out a book.



“And we thought perhaps some magic might help, too,” said Kathleen, “if you find yourselves in danger.” She reached into her cloak again and pulled out a tiny blue bottle. “A potion to make you very small.”

“Wow, great!” said Annie.

“Uh … very small?” said Jack. He remembered how their friend Augusta had been made tiny by the fairies of Ireland. He remembered that he’d been afraid it might happen to them, too. All kinds of ordinary things could seem huge and scary, he thought. “How long would we stay small?” he asked.

“It depends on how many sips you take,” said Kathleen, giving the bottle to Jack. “One sip will make you small for ten minutes, two for twenty, three for thirty, and so on.”

“Thanks,” he said. He put the bottle and the rhyme into his backpack.

“Go now,” said Teddy. “Find the emerald rose while we try to translate the rest of the spell.”

“We’ll do our best,” said Annie.

“Thank you,” said Kathleen. “When you need strength, just think of Penny.”

“We will,” said Jack. He took a deep breath and pointed at the cover of their research book. “I wish we could go there!”

Annie waved at Teddy and Kathleen. “See you later!” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


2. The Red Fort


Kathleen and Teddy were gone. The air was hot. Flies buzzed around Jack’s head.

“These are ambassador clothes?” said Annie.

Jack and Annie were dressed alike. They both wore wide-brimmed felt hats, stockings, buckled shoes, short jackets, and puffy short pants. Jack’s backpack had turned into a leather bag.

“I guess,” said Jack. “This must be how we would’ve dressed almost four hundred years ago in Frog Creek.”

“If we’d both been boys,” said Annie. “So, where are we?”

Jack and Annie looked out the window. The tree house had landed in a row of tall dark trees. The trees stood next to a red fort with a moat, a drawbridge, and massive red battlements.



“Cool fort,” said Jack.

“Yeah, and look—elephants,” said Annie. “I love elephants!”

Leading away from the fort were two streets. One was filled with oxen pulling carts and people riding horses and elephants. Veiled women sat in carriages on the elephants’ backs.

“Yeah, and there’s a bazaar like the one we saw in Baghdad,” said Jack. He pointed to the other street, which was lined with tents and stalls.

“So where do you think we find an emerald stone in the shape of a rose?” said Annie.

Jack picked up their research book and opened to the first page. He read aloud:

In the 1600s, India was a vast land of crowded cities and countless villages. A great deal of India, though, was still covered by wilderness. Wild creatures such as cheetahs, elephants, and Bengal tigers lived in its forests. India’s wilderness was also home for many snakes, including the king cobra, one of the deadliest snakes on earth.



“Yikes,” said Annie. She and Jack looked at pictures of a Bengal tiger and a king cobra. The growling tiger had a huge head and enormous teeth. The cobra had speckled yellow bands around its long body. Its open jaws revealed two deadly fangs.

“Don’t worry,” said Jack with a shiver. “We definitely didn’t land in the wilderness.” He turned the pages until he found a drawing of the red fort. “Yes! Here’s exactly where we landed.” He read:

For several centuries, mighty rulers, known as Great Moguls, ruled over much of India. The wealthiest of the Great Moguls was named Shah Jahãn. He lived inside the Red Fort, where he was protected night and day by imperial guards.



“So the Great Mogul lives right here!” said Annie. “How lucky is that?”

She and Jack looked at the fort again. “I guess those guys must be imperial guards,” Jack said. He pointed to men in white coats and leggings guarding the drawbridge. Some carried spears; others had bows and arrows.

“Right. But who do you think those guys are?” Annie asked, pointing. Two carts pulled by pairs of white oxen had stopped at the entrance to the bridge. Eight men were climbing out of the carts. They wore outfits like Jack’s and Annie’s—puffy pants, short jackets, and wide hats. Two of the guards greeted them with deep bows.

“They’re dressed like us,” said Jack. “So I guess they must be ambassadors, too.”

“If they’re visiting the Great Mogul, we should join them!” said Annie.

“Hold on,” said Jack. He opened his bag. As he put their book inside, he noticed that everything that had been in his backpack was still there: his story from school, the note about the emerald rose, and the blue bottle with the potion to make them small. “Okay, we’ve got everything,” he said.

“Come on, before we miss our chance!” Annie called, starting down the rope ladder.

“Wait!” said Jack. He put his bag over his shoulder and hurried after Annie. By the time he stepped off the ladder, Annie was already heading toward the drawbridge of the fort.

“Annie, hold on! We have to talk about something important!” said Jack. He didn’t want her to say anything crazy to the guards or the ambassadors.

“What?” said Annie, waiting for him.

“If they’re real ambassadors, we shouldn’t get too close to them,” Jack said. “They’ll figure out we’re fakes.”

“Oh. Good point,” said Annie.

“So let’s wait until they start across the bridge,” said Jack. “Then we’ll run to the gate and tell the guards that we’re supposed to be with them. And don’t forget, if anyone asks, you’re my brother. Oh, you should stick your braids under your hat.”

“Right,” said Annie. She tucked her pigtails under her hat. “How’s that?”

“Fine, I guess,” said Jack. He was still worried about the fact that he and Annie looked too young. “We have to try to act like ambassadors. So stand up straight and speak in a low voice.”

“Okay, don’t worry,” said Annie.

“And we should hold up our chins,” said Jack. “Try to look taller.”

“Okay, okay. Oh, look, they’re leaving,” said Annie. “Let’s go!”

The ambassadors had climbed back into their oxcarts. As the carts started across the moat, Jack and Annie walked quickly toward the bridge.

The first guard held up his spear. “Who are you?” he asked. He had a long purple scar on his cheek and silver rings in his ears.

“We are ambassadors,” Jack said in a deep voice. “We are with the gentlemen who just crossed the bridge.”

The guard gave Jack and Annie a sharp look. “You are with the ambassadors from Europe?” he said.

“Yes”—Jack stood straighter—“but we’re from Frog Creek.”

“I imagine you are thinking that we look very young,” Annie said in a low voice. “Well, it is true, we are young. But we are very learned.”

“I see,” said the guard.

“And imaginative and creative,” Annie added.

Oh, brother, thought Jack.

“I see,” said the guard again. He looked at Jack’s bag. “And is that where you carry your treasure? Your gifts for the Great Mogul?”

“Um … well …,” said Jack.

“What gifts do ambassadors from Europe usually give Great Moguls?” Annie asked.

“The gifts sent by the kings and queens of Europe are always rare and beautiful,” said the guard.

“Such as …?” said Annie.

“Silver swords, golden goblets, treasure chests filled with jewels and coins,” said the guard, “or perhaps … the fastest horses from Arabia.”

Forget it, thought Jack.

But Annie smiled. “I see,” she said. “Well, I am pleased to tell you that we have brought a gift far greater than any of those things.”



3. Complete Respect

“Very good!” the guard said. “The Great Mogul eagerly awaits your arrival—and your treasure!”

What treasure? thought Jack. What is Annie talking about?

“You may pass through the gate,” said the guard. “Follow the other ambassadors to the Hall of Public Audience, where the Great Mogul appears each morning before his court nobles.”

“Thanks!” said Annie. She pulled Jack along toward the drawbridge.

“And do not worry,” the guard called after them. “The Great Mogul will not mind your youth. His grandfather became emperor when he was thirteen.”

“Super! Thanks!” Annie called back.

“Hey, what were you talking about back there?” Jack whispered as he and Annie started across the bridge. “We didn’t bring any treasure for the Great Mogul! We didn’t bring anything!”

“Yes, we did,” said Annie.

“What? Tell me what,” said Jack.

“Your story,” said Annie. “It’s in your bag, right?”

“You’ve got to be kidding!” said Jack. “That’s not treasure!”

“Yes, it is! Think about it! You printed your story in fancy curly type from the computer, right?” said Annie. “I did my drawings with sparkle pens. There were no computers or sparkle pens four hundred years ago! The Great Mogul has never seen writing and artwork like that. Our ordinary stuff would be treasure in his time!”

“I—I don’t know.…” Jack didn’t know what to think. He just shook his head.

“It would be! Trust me,” said Annie. “And hurry! We don’t want to lose the other ambassadors!” She ran to the entrance of the Red Fort.

Jack followed her. They passed through a gateway that opened onto a stone road. The road led to a large square. At the opposite side of the square was a long, low building with columns and arches.

“There they are,” said Annie. She pointed to the ambassadors’ oxcarts rolling toward the building.

“That must be the Hall of Public Audience,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie walked quickly toward the building. The air felt as if it were coming from a hot furnace. By the time they arrived at the hall, Jack felt faint from the heat.

The ambassadors from Europe had already gone inside. Fierce-looking guards stood at all the entrances. Daggers and curved swords hung from their belts.

Annie walked up to one of the burly guards. “Excuse me,” she said in a low voice, “but we are ambassadors from Frog Creek, and we are supposed to be with those other ambassadors.”

To Jack’s surprise, the guard asked no questions. He nodded and gestured for them to follow him.

Annie and Jack followed the guard into the shadowy hall. The air inside was much cooler. It smelled of roses and mint. Hidden musicians played soft music.

The burly guard escorted Jack and Annie past the audience of court nobles. All the men had beards or mustaches and wore beautiful coats of many colors and patterns—bright orange, purple, turquoise, green striped, and pale pink with flowers.

Next to the nobles, the eight ambassadors from Europe stood along a silver railing. They were lined up in pairs. The burly guard ushered Jack and Annie to the end of the line.

Everyone in the hall was facing a high platform with wide steps. The platform was made of sparkling diamonds, emeralds, and pearls. Gold columns supported a golden canopy above the platform. Statues of two jeweled peacocks with rubies in their beaks were perched above the canopy. Over the golden canopy was another canopy of rich cloth.

Tall, thin candlesticks held flickering candles, and servants sprayed rose-scented water into the air. As Annie looked around at everything, Jack slipped their book out of his bag. He huddled over it and read to himself.



Every morning, the Great Mogul sat on his Peacock Throne in the Hall of Public Audience. He demanded complete respect. Everyone had to be perfectly still and silent in his presence. No one was allowed to sit or leave as long as he was in the hall. If his guests spoke to him without permission or did not bow the proper way, he could have them killed.



Oh, man! thought Jack. He shoved the book back into his bag and turned to Annie. “Don’t speak!” he whispered. “And we have to bow the proper way!”

“Don’t worry, we learned how to bow in the palace in Vienna,” Annie said.

“No, this is different!” whispered Jack. “When I messed up there, people just laughed. Here, they kill you!”

“Oh. Well, don’t forget we’ve got our potion from Kathleen,” Annie whispered. “If worse comes to worst, we can make ourselves small and escape.”

“Forget it,” Jack whispered. “I don’t want to be a tiny little person! The guards will just chase us down and squash us like bugs!”

Annie laughed.

“This isn’t funny,” said Jack. “Let’s go back outside and make another plan. We don’t know what we’re doing here.”

“Yes, we do,” Annie said. “We’re going to give your story to the Great Mogul, and then we’re going to ask him for an emerald rose. Simple.”

“No, no!” said Jack. “I told you we can’t say a word to him! Not a word! Come on, we have to leave while we’re still alive.”

Annie sighed. “Okay, fine,” she said.

But as Jack and Annie turned to go, trumpet blasts shattered the air. The trumpet sounds were followed by deafening drumrolls.

Shah Jahãn, the Great Mogul of India, stepped through a door at the back of the hall.


4. The Great Mogul


Jack and Annie froze. The hall was completely still and silent. The Great Mogul climbed the steps to the Peacock Throne. He wore an orange turban and a silver coat trimmed with diamonds and pearls. He wore ropes of jewels around his neck and sparkling rings on his fingers.

The Great Mogul sat cross-legged on a cushion and looked coldly at his audience. He had a handsome face with a sharp nose and dark, distant eyes. A servant stood near him, waving a large peacock-feather fan. Another waved a broom to shoo away flies.

An imperial guard escorted a pair of European ambassadors up the wide steps that led to the throne.

Jack and Annie watched carefully as the ambassadors stood before the Great Mogul. The two men bowed from their waists and brushed the back of their right hands over the carpet. They straightened up, raised their right hands into the air, and placed their palms on top of their heads. Then they lowered their hands and stood very still.

So that’s the way to bow before a Great Mogul, thought Jack. He hoped he and Annie could remember how to do it.

One of the ambassadors then opened a bag and pulled out a jewel-studded crown and a golden goblet. He gave them to the Great Mogul. The ruler looked at the glittering gifts. Without smiling, he handed them to a servant who had appeared beside him.

Another servant stepped forward with a silver tray. On the tray was a red satin pillow. Spread across the pillow were dozens of glittering jewels. The ambassadors selected several precious gems. Then they turned and walked slowly down the steps of the throne.

Annie nudged Jack. He looked at her, and she smiled. He knew just what she was thinking: Those guys got jewels without saying a word!

But Jack was still worried. An emerald rose wasn’t an ordinary jewel. Plus, his story seemed like such a teeny gift compared to a crown and a gold goblet.

The other ambassadors climbed the Peacock Throne in pairs. They all bowed in the same way. They all opened their bags and gave gifts to the Great Mogul—a carved wooden clock, a crystal necklace, a gleaming silver sword. As the ruler received each exquisite gift, he never changed his expression.

Jack grew more and more anxious. If the Great Mogul seemed bored with these treasures, what would he think of a kid’s story?

All the ambassadors from Europe were offered jewels from the silver tray. Then they resumed their place in line. Finally an imperial guard beckoned to Jack and Annie. It was their turn!

Jack’s legs felt wobbly as he walked with Annie up the steps of the throne. The Great Mogul looked at them with his distant, cold stare.

Together, Jack and Annie bowed from their waists. They brushed the back of their right hands over the carpet. They stood up and raised their right hands into the air. They placed their palms on top of their heads. Jack held his breath the whole time. A fly landed on his nose, but he didn’t flinch.

Jack and Annie lowered their arms. Jack’s hands were shaky as he unbuckled his bag and pulled out his story. Without a word, he handed it to the Great Mogul.

The ruler stared at the first page. Slowly he ran his fingers over the fancy type. He turned the page and stared at Annie’s sparkly drawing of the tree house in the Frog Creek woods. Again he touched the page.

Then the Great Mogul raised his eyes and looked straight at Jack and Annie. The next thing Jack knew, the servant was standing in front of them with the tray of jewels. In a panic, Jack stared at the pile of diamonds, pearls, and red, green, and yellow gems. The jewels were all cut in different shapes.

Emerald rose! Jack thought wildly. He tried to focus, but the glittering gems swirled in front of his eyes—flowers, fish, stars, birds, butterflies, pears, and apples. But no emerald rose!



When Jack glanced up, he saw the Great Mogul watching him. Jack was ready to grab anything!

Annie reached forward and carefully picked up a green stone. She solemnly showed it to Jack. It was a small emerald shaped like a rose!

Jack nodded, trying to appear calm. His heart was pounding. He glanced at the Great Mogul. The ruler was looking at them with interest. He seemed about to say something. But then a guard beckoned for Jack and Annie to leave the throne platform.

Jack and Annie climbed down the steps and returned to their places behind the other ambassadors.

Wow, wow, wow! Jack thought. We did it!

The Great Mogul stood up from his cushion. Quickly and quietly, he walked down the steps of the Peacock Throne. No one moved as the all-powerful ruler slipped out of the hall.

The whole audience seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. Everyone began talking and moving about. The guards stepped forward to escort the ambassadors through the door at the back of the hall.

“Come on, let’s get out of here!” Jack whispered to Annie. He pulled her away from the other ambassadors, and they joined the stream of court nobles heading toward the doors at the front of the hall.

“Mission accomplished!” Annie exclaimed. She handed Jack the emerald rose.

Jack stared at the delicately cut stone. It had five tiny rose petals that curled back at the edges. “Great work,” he said to Annie. He carefully put the jewel in his bag and buckled it. “I was wrong. You were right.”

“I won’t rub it in,” said Annie with a grin.

“That’s okay, I deserve it,” Jack said. “I shouldn’t have worried so much. Now we just have to get back to the tree house. Keep your head down. Move quickly.”

Jack and Annie wound their way through the crowd, heading for the front doors. Just as they were about to step into the sunlight, another guard blocked their way.

“Excuse us,” said Jack. He tried to step around the guard who towered over them.

But the guard put out his large hand. “I will escort you now to the palace,” he said, “to the private balcony of the Great Mogul.”

“Uh … why?” Jack asked.

“All the ambassadors are to view a parade in their honor,” said the guard.

“Parade?” said Annie. “I love parades.”

“Uh … but we’re kind of in a hurry. Do we have a choice?” Jack asked.

“No,” said the guard.

“Oh,” said Jack. “Okay.”

“This way,” said the guard.

Jack and Annie walked after him back through the empty hall.

“Don’t worry,” Annie whispered to Jack. “What could possibly go wrong at a parade?”


5. Not Funny


The tall guard escorted Jack and Annie out the back door of the hall and into a walled courtyard. The other ambassadors were already entering the palace quarters on the far side.

Jack was so frustrated he barely noticed the crimson and purple flowers, the bubbling fountains, and the dazzling water pools in the courtyard. All he wanted to do was get back to the tree house. Their mission was done. He tried to think of an excuse to get away.

“Annie!” he whispered.

By now Annie was walking ahead and chatting with the guard. “Where do the royal women and children live?” she asked.

The guard pointed to the palace quarters on the left side of the courtyard. Jack noticed veiled women peeping out from behind the arched windows. Annie waved at them, but the women moved out of sight.

The guard escorted Jack and Annie out of the courtyard and through a quiet passageway. The passageway led to a chamber lit with brass lanterns hanging from the wall. The guard handed them each a silk coat, a sash, a pair of pointy shoes, and a jeweled turban.

“Um … what’s this?” asked Jack.

“Gifts from the Great Mogul. You may change in here,” the guard said.

“Oh. Thanks,” said Jack.

The guard pulled aside a curtain to reveal a small space like a dressing room. Jack and Annie stepped inside, and the guard pulled the curtain shut.

Jack whirled around to Annie. “This is awful!” he whispered. “We have to get out of here!”

“Calm down,” said Annie. “We don’t have a choice.” She rubbed her hand over her purple silk coat. “I love these clothes.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack, sighing. But he took off his hot jacket and pulled on his orange coat and tied the sash. He definitely felt cooler in the soft silk coat, but the puffy pants made the coat balloon out around his waist. “I really hate this,” he groaned.

“Don’t worry, we’ll leave right after the parade,” said Annie. She tucked her braids under her orange turban. “Do I still look like a boy?”

“You look ridiculous,” said Jack. “We both look ridiculous. We have to make some excuse so we can leave.”

“Don’t you want to see the parade?” asked Annie.

“Not with a person who kills you if you speak to him or bow the wrong way,” said Jack.

“Maybe we won’t have to bow again,” said Annie.

“You’re missing my point,” said Jack. He put on his blue turban. Then he took off his buckled shoes and pulled on the pointy slippers.

Annie looked at him and laughed.

“Not funny,” said Jack.

“Well, don’t forget, if we run into trouble, we can always drink the potion and make ourselves small,” said Annie.

“And get squashed by the Mogul’s guards? No thank you,” said Jack.

Annie laughed again.

“Not funny,” said Jack.

The imperial guard pushed open the curtain to the dressing room. “Come with me now,” he said.

Jack and Annie followed the guard out of the chamber and down a hallway of the palace. “Remember, don’t talk to the other ambassadors,” whispered Jack. “And never, ever say anything to the Great Mogul. Promise?”

“Don’t worry, I know what to do,” whispered Annie.

Jack and Annie followed the guard through another chamber and out to a wide, shaded balcony. The balcony overlooked a river and a sandy shore.

The Great Mogul stood near the railing of the balcony, with imperial guards surrounding him. The ambassadors stood in a row behind them. Jack was relieved to see that they, too, were wearing pointy shoes and silk coats that stuck out.

Jack gestured to Annie to stand behind the ambassadors. He hoped none of them would try to talk to him. He was relieved to hear trumpets suddenly blaring and drums booming. All the men stepped forward to watch the parade.

Musicians came first. Hundreds of them marched in formation down the flat sandy shore between the palace and the river. Some blew long golden trumpets. Others beat drums tied around their bodies.

Dozens of flag bearers followed the musicians, their red and yellow banners waving in the hot, dry wind. After them came row after row of tall, elegant horses with golden bridles. Some were dark gray. Others were copper colored, milk white, or midnight black.

“One hundred Arabian horses!” an imperial guard announced to the ambassadors. “The most beautiful animals in the world!”

Jack glanced at the Great Mogul. The ruler was coldly watching the parade.

Next came carts pulled by white oxen. Riding on the carts were cheetahs with tan fur and black spots. They wore gold collars that glittered in the sunlight.

“One hundred cheetahs!” announced the guard. “The fastest land animals in the world!”

Then came rows and rows of elephants kicking up a sea of dust. They looked like a fleet of gray ships.



“One hundred elephants caught in the wild!” said the guard. “The largest land animals in the world!”

The elephants wore gold chains and silver bells around their necks. The tops of their heads were covered with fancy fringed cloth. On their backs were straw carriages with riders inside.

“Oh, wow, elephants,” said Annie, her eyes shining.

“Shhh! We can’t talk,” whispered Jack.

Elephants, oxen, and horses all stepped in time to the beat of the drums and the blare of the trumpets.

Suddenly the music was interrupted by wild shrieks and bellows.

The Great Mogul, his guards, and the ambassadors all moved to get a better view. Jack and Annie stood on their tiptoes to see what was happening.

Jack could see that an elephant had broken out of line and left the parade. Guards were struggling to capture it. The elephant had reared up on its hind legs, and its rider had tumbled from the carriage on its back. The elephant was making a terrible noise, like a screaming trumpet.

“What’s happening? What’s making that noise?” said Annie.

“An elephant,” whispered Jack.

“Oh, no!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed her by the arm. “Don’t say anything. Don’t do anything,” he whispered. “Think of Penny.”

“I am! I hate it when animals are hurt!” said Annie. She pulled away from Jack and slipped through the row of ambassadors.

Jack moved after her. “Annie! Come back!” he whispered.

One of the guards saw Annie heading toward the railing where the Great Mogul stood. He quickly stepped in front of her.

“Excuse me, sir, I’m worried about that elephant,” Annie said in a low voice. “What’s wrong with it?”

“She tried to escape,” the guard said. “They are capturing her now.”

“What’s going to happen to her?” asked Annie, trying to look around the guard.

“She will be punished,” said the guard.

“What?” said Annie. “Why?”

“She has failed to show respect for the Great Mogul,” said the guard.

“What?” Annie said.

“Annie!” Jack warned.

But Annie didn’t seem to hear him. “That’s crazy! She’s just an animal!” she said to the guard. Her voice was fierce.

“Annie, quiet! Please!” said Jack.

The imperial guards and the other ambassadors were looking at Annie with alarm. Worst of all, the Great Mogul was staring at her, too.


6. Morning Breeze


“Your Majesty, sir!” Annie called to the Great Mogul. “She’s just an animal! Please don’t let anyone hurt her!”

“Shhh! You can’t talk to him!” Jack whispered furiously.

“Please help her!” Annie said to the Great Mogul. “She doesn’t know how great you are. She doesn’t know she should respect you.”

The Great Mogul kept staring at Annie but said nothing.

“Don’t you love animals?” Annie asked.

The Great Mogul didn’t answer.

“Don’t you love anything?” asked Annie.

The ambassadors gasped. Two of the guards grabbed Annie by her arms.

“No, please, she—he can’t help it!” Jack explained to the guards. “That’s just the way my brother is. He can’t stop himself from talking. Please, tell your ruler that!”

The Great Mogul murmured something to a bodyguard. Then he turned and left the balcony.

The guard looked startled. He said something in a low voice to the men holding Annie. Jack held his breath. Were they going to drag her away? To his surprise, the guards let Annie go.

“Is the Great Mogul going to punish the elephant?” Annie asked.

“No, he is not,” a guard said. “He has given her to you as a gift.”

“What?” said Jack.

“Really?” said Annie.

“Given her to us as a gift? What does that mean, exactly?” Jack asked.

“It means you must take her home,” said the guard. “Back to your own country.”

“Take the elephant home?” said Jack.

“Come with me,” the guard said.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie called as she hurried after the guard, leaving the balcony.

“Take the elephant home?” Jack repeated.

The ambassadors were still gaping at him. “Who are you?” one of them asked. “Where are you from?”

“Jack, ambassador from Frog Creek,” said Jack. “Excuse me.” In a daze, he hurried after Annie and the guard. When he caught up to them, he whispered to Annie, “Have you lost your mind? We can’t take an elephant home!”

“We can’t let her stay here, either,” said Annie.

“They’ll punish her!”

“Okay. Then you can be the one who carries her up the rope ladder,” said Jack.

“Ha-ha,” said Annie.

“It’s not ha-ha,” said Jack, “it’s insane.”

“Look, let’s just get her out of the Red Fort first,” said Annie. “Then we’ll figure out what to do.”

Jack and Annie followed the guard until they emerged at the edge of the square in front of the Hall of Public Audience. Several guards were scuffling with the elephant. They had a rope around her neck. Her ears were flapping. She was snorting and stamping her feet.



The guards pulled on the rope, forcing the elephant down on her knees. Her eyes looked desperate and furious.

“Hey, don’t hurt her!” Jack blurted out.

A guard pointed his saber at Jack. “Climb on. Now. Both of you,” he said. “You have caused enough trouble this day. It is a miracle you are still alive!”

Jack clutched his bag and scrambled awkwardly into the straw carriage on the elephant’s back. Annie climbed in behind him. Crammed together, they gripped the sides of the carriage.

“Her name is Morning Breeze!” the guard shouted. “Take her back to your own land! Go now! Before the Great Mogul changes his mind!”

As if obeying the guard, Morning Breeze rose to her full height. She moved quickly across the square and headed down the stone road that led to the gate.

Jack and Annie bounced up and down. They clutched the sides of the straw carriage, trying not to fall out. Jack could hear the guards roaring with laughter behind them. “Slow down!” Jack shouted to the elephant.

But Morning Breeze ran even faster, her big leathery ears flapping and her bells jangling.

“She’s more like a wind than a breeze!” shouted Annie.

“More like a tornado!” Jack yelled.

Morning Breeze thundered through the gate and over the wooden drawbridge. Jack and Annie held on to the sides of the carriage for dear life. After she’d crossed the moat, the elephant finally slowed to a walk.

Morning Breeze held her trunk high. She seemed to be sniffing the hot wind. Her ears spread out as if she were listening for a distant sound.

“We’re near the tree house! It’s right there in that row of trees!” said Jack. “We have the emerald rose. If we can just make her stop, we can jump off and go home. We can get out of this heat and away from this place—”

“I know, I know,” said Annie. “But—”

“Stop! Stop, Morning Breeze!” said Jack. “Let us off!”

“But what about her?” said Annie. “We can’t just leave her here by herself!”

Jack looked at Morning Breeze’s trunk waving in the air. He heard what sounded like crying coming from the wild elephant. She seemed terribly lost and sad.

Suddenly Jack wanted desperately to help the elephant get back to the wild, wherever that was. “All right,” he said. “Keep going. Go fast!” His voice rose to a shout. “Hurry! Go, Morning Breeze! Go!”



7. Something Very Weird

Her trunk high in the air, Morning Breeze kept sniffing the hot wind.

“We’ll get her away from here!” Jack said to Annie. “Then you and I can walk back to the tree house!”

“Great!” said Annie.

“Go!” Jack yelled again at the elephant. “Go home! Go home!” He looked over his shoulder. He was afraid the Great Mogul might change his mind and send his guards after them.

Morning Breeze let out a long, deep rumble and flapped her ears, as if she’d finally heard a distant call or caught a special scent. Her rumbling cries grew louder and louder—rrrrrrRRRRRR! She lumbered away from the drawbridge of the Red Fort.

Jack was sure the elephant would start down the street filled with horses and oxcarts. But Morning Breeze headed up the other street, the one that went through the bazaar.

“No, no! Go the other way!” cried Jack.

The elephant began to run. Her flat oval feet thumped against the road as she headed toward the tents and stalls of the bazaar. The street was crowded with merchants and shoppers—bearded men in colorful coats and women in outfits that completely hid their faces and bodies.

“Watch out, everyone!” Annie cried.

As the elephant ran between the busy stalls, everyone scrambled out of her way.

“Sorry! Sorry!” yelled Jack.

“Rogue elephant!” a banana seller shouted.

“Sorry! Sorry!” Jack kept shouting.

Morning Breeze knocked over wooden poles that supported white tents. The tents collapsed onto burlap bags filled with figs, rice, and peas. She knocked over baskets of lemons, oranges, and pineapples.

Angry merchants yelled and shook their fists.

“She’s from the wild! She can’t help it!” Annie cried.

“Sorry! Sorry!” Jack said.

Morning Breeze pulled down hanging silk shawls and carpets with her trunk. The silk merchant shouted with rage. He and the other sellers grabbed sticks and charged at the elephant. Jack and Annie scrunched down in their small straw carriage.

“Hurry! Go! Go!” Jack called to Morning Breeze.

With the merchants all chasing after her, Morning Breeze bolted from the bazaar. She started down a narrow pebbled road that soon became a dirt path. She left the bearded merchants shouting angrily in the dust.

Morning Breeze kept running down the path, passing farms with small mud huts. Sheep and goats bleated and scuttled out of her way. Chickens clucked and scattered.

Her bells jangling wildly, the elephant clomped past women and girls tending outdoor cooking fires. She lumbered past men and boys unloading hay from wooden carts.

“Hi! Hi! Excuse us!” Annie yelled, waving. Jack tried to smile as he clung to the sides of the swaying carriage.



No one smiled or waved back. Everyone stared in shock as the elephant thundered by.

Morning Breeze ran to the end of the dirt path. But she didn’t stop there. She kept running, cutting her own path through a sun-scorched field. Jack felt as if they were riding a big gray ship on waves of tall yellow grass.

“This is fun!” said Annie.

Not really, thought Jack. Where in the world were they going?

A million insects hummed and buzzed. Butterflies and dragonflies darted about. The elephant burst from the sea of grass and charged into a scrubby forest. As she plowed through shrubs and trees, birds cawed and flapped out of the brush.

“Okay, slow down, Morning Breeze!” yelled Jack. “You’re back in the wild, so you can let us off now! We need to—”

Before he could finish, the elephant lifted her trunk and let out a loud shriek. She reared up on her hind legs. Jack and Annie tumbled out of the carriage. They slid down the elephant’s back and fell onto the ground. Morning Breeze shrieked again and tore away through the forest.

Jack and Annie lay in the dirt. They heard the elephant trampling plants and crashing through bushes. They heard her bells jangling. Then the sounds faded away.

“Are you okay?” Annie asked.

“Yep,” said Jack. “But that wasn’t very polite of her.”

Annie laughed. “Well, you asked her to let us off,” she said.

“Yeah, but not dump us off,” said Jack. He waved away flies and slapped at mosquitoes. He felt sweaty and thirsty and exhausted. “I wonder how long it will take us to get back to the tree house?”

“I don’t know—let’s just start retracing our steps,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie stood up and brushed the dirt off their coats.

“Hey, where’s your bag?” asked Annie.

“My bag?” said Jack. Where was it? He whirled around. He saw it lying in the grass.

“There!” he said. He hurried to his bag and picked it up. It was open. “Oh, no!” He reached in and pulled out their research book, the blue bottle, and Teddy and Kathleen’s note. He searched frantically for the emerald rose.

“I don’t believe it! The emerald’s missing!” cried Jack.

“It must have slipped out when we fell off Morning Breeze,” said Annie. “We’ll find it. It has to be here somewhere.”

Jack shoved everything back into his bag. Then he and Annie got down on their hands and knees. Jack looked intently at the forest undergrowth—the dried vegetation, sticks, clumps of dirt, and rotten leaves.

“I can’t believe this!” said Jack. They had been so close to returning home, their mission done. Now they were stuck in the middle of nowhere and the emerald rose was missing. “I don’t see it. It’s not here. Maybe it fell out at the bazaar when—”

“Bingo!” said Annie. “There it is!”

“Where? Where?” said Jack.

“There!” Annie said, pointing.

Jack saw it. The emerald rose glittered like a tiny green light in a small, sunlit clearing. It was lying next to a mound of earth and dead leaves.

“Yes!” said Jack. He and Annie scrambled to their feet and headed for the mound.

But when they got closer, Annie grabbed his arm. “Wait! There’s something weird happening there,” she whispered. “Very weird. See?”

“What? Where?” said Jack.

Annie pointed to the mound. Something very weird was happening. The earth and leaves seemed to be moving! Then Jack saw speckled yellow bands and two shiny black eyes.

Jack gasped. “Oh, no,” he whispered. “A king cobra!”


8. SHHHHHH-WISSSSSST!


The king cobra circled the leafy mound. Its skin was olive brown, the color of the dead leaves. It had speckled yellow bands that ran around its scaly body.

“Back up, back up. Go slow,” Jack whispered to Annie. Jack picked up his bag, and they quietly stepped backward, until they got to the edge of the clearing. “Now run!”

Jack and Annie took off. Clutching his bag, Jack ran with little steps, trying not to lose his pointy slippers. After about a hundred yards, Annie came to a halt. “Stop, stop!” She grabbed Jack’s arm. “We shouldn’t get too far away!”

“Why not?” said Jack.

“Penny!” said Annie. “We have to get the emerald for Penny!”

“Right, right,” said Jack. “Okay!” He took a deep breath. “First, we have to get calm.” Jack took another deep breath. Then he pulled out their research book. “Okay. Let’s read about cobras.”

Jack opened the book and found a section about Indian wildlife. He read:

The king cobra is the only snake known to make a nest for its eggs. The nest is made of a mound of dead leaves. The cobra’s scaly skin is the same color as the leaves, a good example of natural camouflage.



“So that mound of leaves was its nest,” said Jack. “And the cobra was probably a mother snake guarding her eggs.”

“How does that information help us?” said Annie.

“It doesn’t,” said Jack. He went on:

King cobras cannot hear, but they have excellent vision and can feel vibrations. They will attack anything they see that gets too close to their nests.



“That’s bad news,” said Annie.

“Yep, really bad news,” said Jack. He kept reading:

When threatened, the king cobra flattens its neck into a hood. A single bite from the snake contains enough venom to kill twenty men or a large elephant.



“Whoa,” said Annie. “That must be why Morning Breeze panicked and ran away.”

Jack closed the book. He shook his head. “I don’t see how we can possibly get close to that nest,” he said.

“Then there’s no way we can get an emerald rose for Penny,” said Annie, “unless we go back to the Great Mogul and ask for another one.”

“And that’s not going to happen,” said Jack.

“Then how can we save Penny?” asked Annie. “Think of Penny.”

Jack thought about Penny. He would do anything for her. “Okay,” he said. “There might be a way we could get the emerald rose. What if … what if we were really small?”

“Yes!” said Annie.

“The cobra can’t hear us, right?” said Jack. “She can only see us and feel vibrations. So if we make ourselves small, maybe we can sneak back and get the emerald without being seen.”

“Yes!” said Annie.

Jack reached into his bag and pulled out the blue bottle. He and Annie both stared at it. “So how many sips should we take?” Jack asked. “One for ten minutes?”

Annie shook her head. “Two for twenty.”

“Okay …” Jack took a deep breath. “But just so you know, when we get small, everything else will be huge, like flies and spiders and—”

“Spiders?” Annie said in a small voice.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Hey, you know what? You don’t have to do this. I can do it by myself. It only takes one person to get the emerald.”

“No! I’ll go. You stay,” said Annie.

“No way,” said Jack. “We’ll both go.”

“Good,” said Annie.

Jack held the bottle up to his lips. “Okay,” he said, “two sips.” He took two quick sips, then handed the bottle to Annie.

Jack felt dizzy. He closed his eyes and hugged himself. He felt as if he were falling through a hole.

SHHHHHH-WISSSSSST!

Suddenly the forest was filled with chirping, whirring, crunching, and squeaking.

“Oh, wow!” whispered Annie. “Open your eyes.”

Jack opened his eyes.

He and Annie were both small—very small. Their clothes and shoes and Jack’s bag were all small, too.

“Oh, man, we got really small,” said Jack. He looked around at the grass and the weeds and the mushrooms—they were all taller than he was! “I think we shrunk to about six or eight inches.”

Close to the ground, the scrubby forest was awake and alive, filled with the ripe smells of earth, noisy insect sounds, and the rustling and whispering of grasses and weeds. The dirt glittered as if sprinkled with flecks of silver.

“It’s really beautiful,” said Annie.

“Yeah …,” said Jack.

Wildflowers looked like elegant and luminous umbrellas with pale pink petals and silvery leaves. Berries were the size of apples.

“Look up!” said Annie.

“Wow!” said Jack.

The tall trees of the forest were like skyscrapers. It was hard to see where they ended.

WHUP! Something plopped down in the dirt beside Jack.

“AHHH!” Jack and Annie grabbed each other in terror.

It was a giant insect—as long as Jack’s arm! It had a flat brown body, six legs, and two sets of wings. It looked at them with huge, goggle-like eyes. It waved its antennae and crept forward.

“AHHH!” Jack and Annie stumbled backward.

The giant bug stopped. Then it rubbed its front wings together. The forest erupted with shrill chirping—Creekle! CREEKLE! Creekle! CREEKLE!

Jack covered his ears and laughed. The giant insect was a cricket! He knew a cricket wouldn’t hurt them. The cricket pushed off the ground with its long hind legs and leapt into the brush.

“Look!” said Annie, glancing up.

A giant golden yellow butterfly hovered above her. As if Annie were a flower, the butterfly touched down lightly on her head and opened its wings. Annie held her breath. She didn’t move a muscle. She looked like she was wearing a wide yellow hat.

The butterfly closed its wings, then opened them, and with a whispery sound, fluttered deeper into the forest.



Bzzzzzzzzzzz-zzzzzzzzzzz.

A gigantic bee circled above Jack. “Whoa. Keep moving, buddy!” Jack said, ducking and waving his hands. “We’re not flowers!”

The bee buzzed lazily away.

“Hey, we’d better hurry and get our emerald before we become our real size again,” said Annie.

“Oh, right!” said Jack.

“Which way?” asked Annie.

Jack looked around. It was hard to tell where they were. “I remember the emerald was shining in the sunlight.”

“It looks sunny over there,” said Annie. She pointed to a clearing.

“So let’s creep through the shade toward the light,” said Jack. “Remember, the cobra can’t hear us, but she can see us and feel our vibrations. We have to stay hidden and step lightly.”

“Hey, I wonder where the dad is,” said Annie.

“Don’t ask,” said Jack. “Don’t think about it. We have enough to worry about. Come on. Let’s go.”

He and Annie crouched down and started creeping toward the sunlight.



9. Camouflage

Jack and Annie stepped lightly through dead leaves and pushed aside feathery weeds that towered above them. They carefully climbed over twigs, pebbles, and tangled roots. They skirted around a deserted anthill as high as Jack’s knees.

When they got to the edge of the cobra’s clearing, Jack stopped. He held up his hand and Annie nodded. They peered between tall blades of grass.

The emerald rose glittered in the sunlight. It looked as big as a softball. The cobra was still coiled around her nest. But now she looked as big as a monster in a fairy tale.

“Whoa!” Jack breathed.

“What do you think we should do?” Annie whispered. “Should I just run as fast as I can, grab it, and run back?”

“No, no!” said Jack. He was shocked by how big the cobra looked.

“I think she’s asleep,” said Annie.

“We can’t really tell,” said Jack. “Her eyes are hard to see because of her camouflage.”

“So how—” started Annie.

“That’s it!” said Jack. “Camouflage!”

“What about it?” said Annie.

“That’s how we’ll get the emerald!” said Jack. “We’ll use our own camouflage.”

“You mean like leaves?” said Annie.

“Yeah, leaves would be good,” said Jack. They looked around. “There.” He pointed to a vine with large light green leaves. He and Annie gripped one of the leaves and pulled until it tore off the vine.

Annie held it up in front of her like a shield. “How’s this?” she said.

“Great,” said Jack. “Now one for me.” He and Annie gripped another leaf and pulled until they ripped it from the vine, too.

“Poke holes in them, so we can see,” said Annie.

“Good idea,” said Jack. They poked holes in their leaves and then held them up, covering their faces. Jack moved his leaf around until he could see the emerald through the eyeholes.

“Go slowly and stick with me,” Jack said. “Two steps, then stop. Two steps, then stop.”

“Got it,” said Annie.

Holding their leaves in front of them, Jack and Annie carefully stepped into the clearing. They took two steps toward the emerald, then stopped … two steps, then stopped.

The cobra didn’t move. Jack desperately hoped she was asleep. He and Annie took two more steps, then stopped. The emerald glittered in the hot sunlight. They took two more steps. Then Annie gasped.

The cobra was lifting her body above her nest! Her head was broad and flat. She swayed back and forth and looked around with staring eyes.

Jack and Annie froze.

Then slowly the cobra lowered her head. Jack let out his breath. Their camouflage had worked! He motioned to Annie, and they both took another two steps, then stopped.

Jack was only a step away from the jewel now. Holding up his leaf camouflage with one hand, he leaned over and scooped up the emerald. It felt as heavy as a big rock. Holding the leaf with one hand, Jack used his other hand to shove the emerald into his bag. With Annie behind him, he stepped backward—two steps, then stopped.

Jack kept his eye on the cobra coiled around her nest. He and Annie kept backing up.

Suddenly a sound came from behind them—a strange hissing, growling sound. A chill went through Jack. He turned around.

A monster-size cobra towered over them.

“The dad!” yelled Annie.



The male cobra had the same coloring as the female. His hood was spread out as he raised himself high above the grass. He swayed from side to side, staring down at Jack and Annie with cold, unblinking eyes. He opened his giant mouth, showing two deadly fangs.

“AHHH!” said Jack and Annie.

They dropped their leaves and crouched down, hiding themselves in the grass. “Go—go!” sputtered Jack. They took off, scrambling through the undergrowth of the forest.

Jack led the way as they both half crawled, half ran over the dirt and through the grass. Jack lost his slippers and ripped his coat. Like a mouse, he clambered over sticks and twigs, nuts, seeds, bark, feathers, mosses, and mushrooms. All kinds of ants and beetles scuttled out of the way. The air was filled with screeching insect sounds.

Jack had no idea where he was running, but he knew he couldn’t stop. He was sure the cobra was slithering after them, thrashing through the undergrowth. Maybe both king cobras were searching for them now, he thought, and all the forest was screaming about it.

Jack stumbled over a stick. He scrambled up from the dirt and looked around wildly. Where was Annie? He didn’t see her! Had she gone off in another direction? Where were the cobras? Had they chased after Annie instead of him?

Jack panicked. “Annie!” he shouted.

The ground trembled. Jack heard thumping, thrashing, and bells. He crouched down in the grass and covered his head. He heard Annie shout, “Jack! Where are you, Jack?” She sounded as if she was up in a tree! What was going on?

Jack looked up. Suddenly a gigantic snake dropped down in front of him.

“AHHH!” Jack yelled.

“Yay!” Annie yelled from overhead.

The snake didn’t have the olive brown skin of a cobra. It was gray and wrinkled. It wasn’t a snake at all! It was the trunk of an elephant!

Before Jack could think, the tip of the elephant’s trunk curled around him. Clutching him like a banana, Morning Breeze lifted Jack up in the air. Jack clung to his bag so he wouldn’t lose the emerald again. The trunk curled back, and Jack could see the sky whirling above him.

The elephant uncoiled her trunk and let go of Jack. He plopped down into the straw carriage. Annie was already there!

“Morning Breeze!” Annie cried. “She came back for us!”

Jack was so small, he couldn’t see over the sides of the carriage. He tried to stand up to look for the cobras. But just then Morning Breeze bellowed and bolted through the forest. Jack lost his balance and fell backward.

Jack and Annie both laughed as they bounced around in the basket on the back of the elephant. They were safe from the cobras! They had their emerald rose! And Morning Breeze had risked her life to save them!

SHHHHHH-WISSSSSST!


10. Caught in the Wild


Instantly the straw carriage felt small and cramped. Jack and Annie sat up and looked at each other.

“We’re big again,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, dazed.

“Where’s the emerald?” said Annie.

Jack opened his bag. The jewel looked tiny again, but it was there. “No problem. I have it,” he said.

“It was kind of fun being so little, wasn’t it?” said Annie.

“Yeah, until we nearly got killed by humongous, superpoisonous snakes,” said Jack.

“Thanks for saving us, Morning Breeze!” called Annie. She reached out from the carriage and patted the elephant’s wrinkled skin.

“Yeah, thanks,” said Jack.

Morning Breeze made a trumpet sound and swayed from side to side as she tramped through the low, scraggly brush.

“I wonder where she’s going,” said Jack.

The elephant slowed down. She sniffed the air with the tip of her trunk. Then she stopped near a clump of bushes and made a low purring sound.

A snuffling noise came from behind the bushes. Branches and leaves shook and parted.

“Ohhhh, wow!” breathed Annie.

A baby elephant bumbled out into the open. He had a fuzzy head and bright, shining eyes.

Morning Breeze lowered herself onto her knees. She stretched out her trunk and stroked her baby. The little elephant nuzzled against her.

“So that’s why Morning Breeze had to escape the fort!” said Annie. “When they captured her in the wild, they took her away from her baby. She was desperate to get back to him.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, “and after she found him, she came back to help us.”

Annie climbed out of the straw carriage and carefully slid down off the elephant’s back. Jack followed her.

Annie patted the elephant’s back. “I guess you’ll be staying here now that you’ve found your baby.”

Jack rubbed his hand over Morning Breeze’s skin. Her huge, wrinkled body smelled of grass and heat and trees. The elephant actually looked as if she were smiling.

“I don’t think you need to wear this stuff anymore,” said Annie. She reached up and lifted the rope of silver bells off the elephant’s neck. The bells jangled as Annie dropped them into the grass.

“Or this,” said Jack. He took the fringed cloth off the elephant’s head.

“And especially this,” said Annie. Together she and Jack unbuckled the strap that held the straw carriage in place on Morning Breeze’s back. They pulled the carriage off and set it on the grass.

“Doesn’t that feel better?” said Jack.

Morning Breeze stared at Jack and Annie. Her eyes were bright and clear. She trumpeted and rose to her full height.

“Before you go, can we pet your baby?” asked Annie.

The large elephant didn’t seem to mind as Annie reached out and stroked the baby elephant. “Whoa,” Annie breathed. “Pet him, Jack.”

Jack rubbed his hand slowly over the baby’s head. The elephant’s fuzzy hair felt coarse and tickly. Jack laughed.

“Enjoy being home in the wild again,” Annie said to Morning Breeze. “Jack and I have to go back to our home now.”



“Thanks, Morning Breeze,” said Jack. “Good luck.”

“We love you,” said Annie.

Morning Breeze flapped her ears and waved her trunk at them. Then she turned and lumbered off with her baby at her heels. The two of them kicked up grass and dirt as they disappeared into the brush.

“Wow,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

Annie turned to Jack and laughed. “We look like we’ve been in a train wreck,” she said.

“No kidding,” said Jack. They’d both lost their pointy shoes, and their coats were torn and dirty.

“At least we have our emerald rose,” said Annie. “And Morning Breeze is back with her baby.”

“Mission done,” said Jack.

“So let’s go back to the tree house,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He looked around. “But … where the heck are we?”

“I think the big field we came through is over there,” said Annie, pointing. “I hear a lot of bug noise. Let’s look.”

Jack and Annie headed for the field. “Oww! Oww!” Weeds and rocks jabbed their bare feet. Jack just missed stepping on a large anthill. He and Annie picked their way through the scrubby forest, until they came to the edge of the yellow field.

The sounds of buzzing and chirping filled the air. The tall grasses rustled in the dry, hot wind.

“That’s it,” said Jack. “So to get back to the tree house, we cross the field, then go on the dirt path, then head back through the bazaar and down the road to the Red Fort. Got it?”

“Got it,” said Annie.

“I just hope we don’t get eaten alive by bugs,” said Jack, “or get heatstroke or get clobbered by those angry guys in the bazaar or—”

“Enough, stop,” said Annie, grinning. “One thing at a time. Come on, don’t be chicken. The bugs are more afraid of us than we are of them. Run!”

Annie and Jack started running through the dry, dusty field. Their torn silk coats billowed behind them. Jack could feel grasshoppers and all sorts of buzzy and jumpy things bashing against him, but nothing really hurt. His feet crushed the dry, tough grass, until he and Annie finally reached the dirt path.

“Yes! We—we made it!” Annie said, out of breath. “Oh! Look …”

Jack was burning up. He felt dizzy. “Whew, we—”

“Look!” Annie said again. She grabbed Jack and pointed to a farmer hauling hay. The farmer was talking to an imperial guard in a horse-drawn carriage. It was the same guard who had escorted them to the Great Mogul’s balcony!

The farmer pointed back at Jack and Annie. The guard turned and saw them.

“Oh, no! He must be searching for us,” said Jack. “Hide!”

But it was too late. The guard had jumped out of the carriage. He was striding toward the edge of the field. “Stop, ambassadors from Frog Creek!” he called.

Jack held his breath as he and Annie waited for the guard.

The guard looked about as he approached them. “Where is the elephant?” he asked.

“She threw us off,” said Annie.

“Yeah, and then she ran that way,” said Jack. He pointed to the right, while Annie pointed to the left.

But the guard didn’t seem to care about the elephant, nor did he seem to care about their bare feet and torn coats. “You must come with me,” he said gruffly.

“Why?” asked Jack.

The guard wrapped his hand around the hilt of his sword. “Because if you do not, you will be put in jail for the rest of your lives,” he said.

“Oh,” said Jack. “Good reason.”



11. Heart to Heart

Jack and Annie silently followed the guard to his carriage and climbed in the back. The guard flicked the reins, and the pair of black horses took off, trotting down the dirt path.

Annie looked at Jack. “I wonder where we’re going,” she whispered.

Jack just shook his head. His worst thought was that the Great Mogul had changed his mind and wanted to punish them.

The horses passed the mud huts, the men and boys hauling hay, the women and girls cooking outdoors. They passed goats and sheep and chickens.

The horses clopped down the stone road. They moved easily through the bazaar. Jack saw that the silks and carpets were hanging on the lines again. Oranges, lemons, and pineapples were back in the baskets. Tent poles were all standing, and the bearded merchants looked happy and busy.

The horses trotted down the street toward the Red Fort. When they came to the drawbridge, Jack expected them to cross the moat and head back to the palace, but they didn’t. The horses trotted past the fort and down a road along the river.

The sun was low in the sky when the horse-drawn carriage came to a square. The horses stopped before a massive red gateway with an arched entrance.

The guard turned to Jack and Annie. “You are to go inside and wait,” he said.

“Okay. Thanks for the ride,” said Annie.

The guard stayed in the carriage while Jack and Annie climbed out. They walked up to the looming gateway.

“Where are we?” Annie whispered to Jack. “And why are we here?”

“If I knew, I’d tell you,” whispered Jack.

Jack and Annie stepped under the high, arched entrance. Leading from the entrance was a narrow canal stretching to the horizon.

In the sunset, Jack thought he saw a cloud of mist hovering above the ground. Then he realized it was a shimmering, milky white dome about twenty stories high. It seemed to float between the earth and the sky. There were four tall towers at the corners of a terrace beneath the dome.

Jack and Annie just stared at the dreamlike vision. Then they saw a man walking along the narrow canal toward them. As the man got closer, Jack caught his breath. It was the Great Mogul! No guards were with him. He was all alone.

The Great Mogul stopped and stared at them. His gaze took in their ragged, torn coats and bare feet.

Jack panicked. They looked terrible. Would the ruler think they weren’t showing proper respect for him?

“Bow,” Annie whispered.

Together, they bowed from their waists and brushed their right hands on the ground. They straightened up, raised their right hands into the air, and placed their palms on their heads. Then they lowered their hands and stood perfectly still. Jack cast his eyes down, afraid to look directly at the Great Mogul.

There was a moment of silence. Then the all-powerful ruler spoke. “I have never read such writing before. Or seen such artwork,” he said.

Jack looked up at the Great Mogul. But he didn’t know what to do. Were they allowed to talk?

“Excuse me, Your Majesty,” said Annie. “Is it all right to speak?”

“Yes,” said the Great Mogul.

“Thank you. Well, Jack wrote the words,” said Annie. “And I drew the pictures.”

The Great Mogul nodded. “Your story and pictures tell of riding through the world in a tree house. You tell of saving a huge octopus, a baby gorilla, and a baby kangaroo. You tell of helping brilliant men named Leonardo da Vinci and William Shakespeare. You tell of rescuing children from a giant ocean wave and from a sinking ship. You are a great storyteller,” he said to Jack.

“Oh, not really,” said Jack. He felt embarrassed. “I just told about stuff that happened to us.”

The Great Mogul turned to Annie. “Your pictures are filled with life and joy. They are rich and stirring. You are a great artist,” he said.

“Not really,” Annie said. “Lots of people draw better than me. What you probably loved was the perfect printing of Jack’s story and the sparkly colors of my pens.”

“Yeah, we can’t take credit for those things,” said Jack.

The Great Mogul almost smiled. “The perfect letters and the sparkles were not what I liked best,” he said. “I liked the heart in the story. I liked the heart in the drawings.”

Jack couldn’t explain why, but he thought he understood what the Great Mogul meant.

“And now I want to answer the question you asked me today,” the Great Mogul said to Annie. “You asked if I loved anything. I could not speak freely in front of my guards or my foreign guests. But the answer is yes. I once did love something—someone—very much. My wife. She was my best friend and the mother of many children. I wept an ocean of tears when she died.”

“Oh. I’m so sorry,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“You have shown me your hearts,” said the Great Mogul. “Now I show you mine.” He turned and looked at the shimmering dome. “This is the tomb of marble I built for my wife. It is called the Taj Mahal.”


12. The Meaning of the Emerald


Jack, Annie, and the Great Mogul were silent for a long moment. The marble of the Taj Mahal seemed to change color as the sun went down. Against the darkening sky, it went from pale pink to orange to purple. The dome sparkled as if it were covered with a thousand tiny lights.



“How did you make it sparkle like that?” Annie asked finally.

“Stonecutters set precious stones in the marble,” said the Great Mogul. “Many were cut in the shapes of flowers and leaves. The emerald rose you chose today is like the carved flowers set in the Taj Mahal.”

“It’s really beautiful,” Jack said.

“Yes. Many say it is the most beautiful building in all the world,” said the Great Mogul. “But hidden beneath the sparkle and magnificence of the Taj Mahal is simply the lonely heart of one person who loved another.” The Great Mogul had tears in his eyes. He cleared his throat and looked away from them. “And the elephant I gave you—where is she now?”

“Uh … actually …,” Jack started. He didn’t know what to say. How could he protect Morning Breeze?

“We left her in the forest,” Annie finished. “She has a baby she wanted to take care of. You probably didn’t know this, but Morning Breeze was a new mom when she was captured. She’s a good mother. She should stay with her baby.”

The Great Mogul nodded. “I understand,” he said. “My wife was a good mother, too. The last thing she said to me was ‘Please take care of our children.’ Do not worry, the elephant will remain in the forest with her child.”

“Thank you,” said Annie.

The Great Mogul stared at them for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice was kind. “You are ambassadors from far away,” he said, “but you are children, too. You should go back to your home, to those who care for you.”

“A splendid idea,” said Jack, trying to sound like an ambassador.

“Come.” The Great Mogul walked with Jack and Annie back to the arched entrance and through the tall gate. He waved at the driver in the cart. Then he turned to Jack and Annie.

“Farewell,” he said. “Travel safely.”

“Thank you,” said Annie.

“Bow,” Jack whispered to her.

Jack and Annie performed their bow one last time. When they straightened up, the Great Mogul nodded.

“Oh, and thank you for the emerald rose,” said Annie. “It is a priceless treasure.”

“You are most welcome,” said the Great Mogul. “The rose was my wife’s favorite flower. And, as you know, emeralds stand for love.” For the first time, a warm smile crossed his face.

Jack and Annie smiled back at him.

But the Great Mogul was suddenly serious again, as if he wasn’t allowed to smile. He looked at Jack and Annie for a moment. Then, without another word, he turned and walked through the tall gate, back toward the shimmering tomb of his wife.

Jack looked at Annie. “Let’s go home now,” he said.

Jack and Annie walked to the guard and his horse-drawn carriage. “Please take us to the trees outside the walls of the Red Fort,” Jack said.

The guard flicked his reins. The black horses trotted along the river in the pink twilight. They passed veiled women on the backs of elephants, white oxen pulling a cart, and small boys driving a herd of sheep. They stopped near the row of dark trees outside the Red Fort.

“This is fine. We’ll get out here, please,” said Jack.

The guard gave them a silent nod.

Jack and Annie jumped out of the cart. They ran under the trees to the rope ladder and climbed into the tree house. Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. Before he made the wish, he and Annie looked out the window.

In the distance, they could just see the Taj Mahal. It glowed faintly in the hot night, like a shimmering cloud.

“Oh, wait …,” said Jack. “I just remembered something.” He reached into his bag and pulled out the note from Kathleen and Teddy. He read aloud:

Ye say that ye wish

your spell be reversed?

Four things ye must find.

Here is the first:



In the shape of a rose

is an emerald stone

that uncovers the heart

of one who’s alone.



Jack put the note away. “Our mission wasn’t really done until now,” he said. “We were so worried about the emerald rose, we forgot the part about uncovering the heart of one who’s alone.”

“The Great Mogul,” said Annie. “Even though he has millions of followers, he’s really lonely.”

Jack and Annie looked out the window again. “Good-bye, Great Mogul,” Annie said. “I hope your heart feels better someday.”

Jack took a deep breath. He pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Jack and Annie were wearing their own clothes again. Jack’s bag was a backpack. A warm wind was blowing the trees in the Frog Creek woods.

“I’m glad it’s not boiling hot here,” said Jack.

“It feels good,” said Annie. “You’ve still got the emerald rose, right?”

Jack looked in his backpack. “Got it,” he said. He pulled out their note, their research book, and the blue bottle, and he left them in the corner of the tree house.

Then Jack took out the sparkling stone and held it up to the afternoon light. “This is for you, Penny,” Jack said. “We’ll take this home and keep it safe until we see Teddy and Kathleen again.”

“Good,” said Annie.

Jack carefully put the emerald rose back into his backpack. Then he looked at Annie. “Home,” he said.

Jack and Annie climbed down the rope ladder. As they walked through the Frog Creek woods, Annie was unusually quiet.

“What’s on your mind?” Jack asked.

“Well, I was just thinking that it’s really cool that emeralds stand for love,” said Annie. “Love was the reason for every big thing that happened today.”

“How do you mean?” said Jack. He thought their day had been crazy.

“Well, we went on our mission because Merlin—and everyone else in Camelot—loves Penny,” said Annie, “and we love her, too.”

“Right …,” said Jack.

“And the Great Mogul gave us Morning Breeze because I loved her,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

“And Morning Breeze took us into the wild because she loved her baby,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

“And we ran into trouble with the cobras because they loved their babies-to-be,” said Annie.

“Yeah …,” said Jack. “Okay.”

“And finally, the Great Mogul showed us the Taj Mahal, which is the most amazing building we’ve ever seen, and he built it because he loved his wife,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “You’re right.” Annie made it all sound so simple.

“And now I would love to go home,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“Hey, we can tell Mom and Dad you got an A plus on your story,” said Annie. “We’ll print it out again.”

“Yeah, and I made copies of your artwork,” said Jack. “Except the sparkles don’t really show.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “The sparkles aren’t that important.”

“Right,” said Jack. “It’s the heart that counts.” And the two of them left the Frog Creek woods and headed home under the cloudless May sky.



Author’s Note

Taj Mahal

Shah Jahãn, the Great Mogul whose name means “king of the world,” ruled the Mogul Empire of India from 1628 to 1658. Shah Jahãn was a ruthless king, but he was also a supporter of writing, painting, and astonishing architecture. And he left behind many buildings, mosques, and beautiful gardens.

Shah Jahãn’s favorite wife was Mumtãz Mahal, who bore him fourteen children. After she died, he built a mausoleum, or large tomb, in her memory. The mausoleum was called the Taj Mahal, which means “crown palace.”

It took over twenty years to finish the Taj Mahal. Twenty thousand men from all over the Mogul Empire worked on it, using small hand tools to split the marble stone. Artisans set precious gems into the marble to make flowers. A court poet wrote:

They set stone flowers in the marble

that by their color, if not their perfume,

surpass real flowers.



A Russian visitor in the late 1800s wrote that the flowers looked so natural that you wanted to touch them to make sure they weren’t real. He said that “every leaf, every petal is a separate emerald, pearl or topaz” (Diana and Michael Preston in Taj Mahal, p. 190).

Asian Elephants

There are two different kinds of elephants: Asian and African. Asian elephants have smaller ears than African elephants, their skin is not quite as wrinkly, and their backs are dome-shaped. Both species are endangered because their habitats are shrinking and poachers are illegally hunting them for the ivory in their tusks.

An Asian elephant uses its trunk not only to smell, but also to drink water and to wipe its eyes, as well as to play and grapple with other elephants. And it uses the trunk as a sort of finger that can coil around food and lift it up to the elephant’s mouth.

King Cobras

King cobras, the largest venomous snakes in the world, can be eighteen feet long. A king cobra can lift up to one-third of its body into the air—which means that an eighteen-foot-long cobra can rise six feet off the ground!
