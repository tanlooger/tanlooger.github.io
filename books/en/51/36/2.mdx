title: 2. Who Are They?
---






Snow blew into the tree house.

Jack and Annie wore wool coats, hats, and mittens. Jack’s canvas backpack had turned into a leather briefcase with buckles and a shoulder strap. Jack and Annie looked out the window.

Below the tree house was a wide, snow-covered field that ended in a wall of evergreen trees. Beyond the trees was a city skyline.

“This is definitely New York,” said Annie. “See the Empire State Building? Remember our visit to the top?” She pointed to a faraway building that rose above the others. “This must be Central Park. I remember that big field.”



“Yeah, I do, too,” said Jack. “But we’ve landed in New York in 1938. It was different back then.” He opened their research book and read from the introduction:

The city of New York is the largest city in the Western Hemisphere. It covers an area of 322 square miles.



Jack closed the book. “Whoa. Even in 1938, New York was a huge city,” he said. “This is going to be like looking for a needle in a haystack.”

“I’ll read our mission poem again,” said Annie. She read the first verse aloud:

The very last unicorn

Is now hidden well

By those who have put him

Under a spell.



“Okay, so this unicorn was put under a spell,” said Jack, “and he must be hidden somewhere in New York, or Merlin wouldn’t have sent us here.”

“Right,” said Annie. She read the next verse:

Four centuries, four decades

From that afternoon,

At the end of November,

Before the blue moon,



“What’s a blue moon?” asked Annie, looking up. “I’ve heard that expression before.”

“It’s when you have two full moons in the same month,” said Jack. “It doesn’t happen very often.”

“Oh,” said Annie. She read on:

He will wake once more

And be free to go home

If you call out his name:

Divine Flower of Rome.



“Wait, does that mean the unicorn’s name is Divine Flower of Rome?” asked Jack.

“I guess,” said Annie. She read on:

You must coax him to stand

Once his name is spoken.

His chain will breaks

And the spell, too, be broken.



Then a young girl must love him

And show him the way,

Lest he be trapped forever

On public display.



If he loses this chance

To rise and depart,

All magic will fade

From his horn and his heart.



“So I’m the young girl!” said Annie. “And I have to help him get home, or his magic will fade away forever!”

“Right,” said Jack. “Okay. Let’s review: There’s a unicorn on public display somewhere in New York City. He’s under a spell. The spell runs out in late November before a blue moon. But he’ll only wake up when someone calls his name, which is Divine Flower of Rome. Then a young girl—you— must love him and show him the way home.”

“Great,” said Annie. “Let’s get started.”

“Get started? How?” said Jack.

“Maybe we should talk to some New Yorkers,” said Annie. “We can ask them if they know anything about a unicorn in New York City.” She looked out the window. “There’re some people in the park right now.”

Jack looked out. Through the falling snow, he saw girls crossing the field carrying skates. He saw two people standing on top of a small hill. One wore a cape, and the other a long raincoat.

“If we start asking people about unicorns, they’ll think we’re crazy,” said Jack.

“Who cares?” said Annie. “Maybe someone will at least know something that can help us. Let’s go down.” She started down the ladder.

Jack quickly packed up their books. He buckled his bag and followed her. When they stepped onto the ground, Jack and Annie looked around. The skaters were gone. The two people on the hill were gone, too.

“Where’d everybody go?” said Jack.

“I don’t know. But we’ll find someone else. Come on,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie started across the wide field. The snow was falling fast and furiously. The wind blew harder.

“Look, a frozen pond,” said Annie, pointing. “That must be where the skaters were coming from.”

Wet snow stuck to Jack’s glasses. He wiped them off so he could see. No one was skating on the pond now. Whirlwinds of powdery snow swirled over the ice.

“Keep going,” said Jack.

They kept trudging through the snow.

“Hey, look! Remember that?” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack. He wiped the snow off his glasses again. He saw a merry-go-round. “Oh, yeah.” On their trip to New York with their aunt Mallory, they’d taken a ride on it. But now the riderless painted horses looked sad and lonely.



“I feel like we’re the last living creatures in Central Park,” said Jack.

“Which way do we go now?” asked Annie. “Which way did we come from?”

It was hard to see anything in the white haze of the falling snow. The buildings bordering the park and the skyscrapers in the distance had disappeared.

“Let’s see what our book says,” said Jack. He unbuckled his leather briefcase and pulled out their research book. He found a picture of Central Park and read:

Central Park is a vast natural area in the middle of New York City. The park has thirty-two miles of winding footpaths and covers 840 acres of land. It has rock formations, woods, and many bodies of water. It also has—



“Okay, okay, got it,” said Annie. “It’s a big park. Is there a map that shows where we are?”

Jack tried to read from the index, but the wind and snow made it impossible. He stuffed the book back into his briefcase. “Forget it,” he said. “Let’s just try to get out of the park.”

Jack and Annie turned away from the lonely merry-go-round and walked across the snow. A gust of wind blew Jack’s cap off. As he turned around to grab it, he saw a couple walking a short distance behind them.

The two people looked like teenagers. They were walking with their heads bowed against the wind. The girl wore a dark cape with a hood. The boy wore a hat and a tan raincoat with a belt.

“Hey, look—” Jack said to Annie. But at that moment, the wind shook the trees, and big clumps of snow fell from the branches. Jack and Annie ducked and covered their heads. When the wind died down, Jack looked around for the couple.

“They’re gone now,” he said.

“Who’s gone?” said Annie. “Who did you see?”

“Two teenagers, I think,” said Jack. “A boy and a girl. We saw them earlier from the tree house. I think they might be following us.”

“Wait a second,” said Annie. “Two teenagers? A boy and a girl? Following us? Who does that remind you of?”

A big smile crossed Jack’s face. “Teddy and Kathleen?” he said.

“Think about it,” said Annie. “On our last three missions, it seemed like Teddy and

Kathleen were always nearby, wearing disguises, ready to help us when we needed it.”

“Right,” said Jack. “We could sure use their help now.” He turned around. “Hello!” he shouted.

“Hello!” Annie yelled.

But the wind answered them with a howl. More clumps of snow blew down on Jack and Annie.

“Let’s get going,” said Annie. “They’ll find us sooner or later. They always do.”
