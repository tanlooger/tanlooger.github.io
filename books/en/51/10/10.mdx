title: 10. Echo from the Past
---



Jack and Annie looked outside.

The sun had slipped behind the trees of the Frog Creek woods.

Annie still held the ancient scroll. She put it in the corner, next to the scroll from their ocean trip.

“Just two more to go,” she whispered.

“Yup,” said Jack. He unzipped his pack. He pulled out Days of the Wild West. He put it on top of a stack of books.

“Ready?” he said.

Annie was staring at the books. Her mouth dropped open.

“What’s wrong?” asked Jack.

Annie just kept staring.

“Have you gone nuts?” said Jack.

Annie pointed at the Wild West book.

“Read the cover,” she said.

Jack picked the book up. He read the title aloud: “Days of the Wild West.” He looked at Annie. “So?”

“Keep reading,” said Annie.

The author’s name was below the title. It was in smaller letters. Jack read: “Slim Cooley.”

Jack gasped. His mouth dropped open. He and Annie stared at the words for a long moment.



“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We were using Slim’s book. The book he wrote after he left us!”

Jack and Annie shook their heads with wonder.

Jack opened Slim’s book. He looked at the title page. At the bottom of the page, he read: Texas Press, Dallas, 1895.

Jack turned the page. He read the dedication:

WITH THANKS TO SMILEY AND SHORTY,

TWO STRANGERS WHO CHANGED MY LIFE



Jack looked at Annie. “Slim dedicated his book to us,” he said.

“Yup,” said Annie. She smiled.

Jack placed Slim’s book back on the stack of books.

Then he and Annie left the tree house and climbed down the ladder.

As they started through the woods, the trees were alive with bird sounds. The air felt soft and moist.

“Frog Creek seems so peaceful,” said Jack. “No rattlers, no rustlers, no ghosts.”

“Yeah, but no Slim Cooley, either,” said Annie sadly.

“I know,” said Jack. “But when we read his book, it’s like he’s still talking to us.”

“Oh, right,” said Annie. “You mean it’s like an echo from the past?”

“Yeah,” said Jack softly. “Wow.”

Just then, out of the blue, a voice called, “Jack! Annie!”

“It’s Dad!” said Annie.

“Coming!” she and Jack shouted.

Then they ran all the way home, through the long shadows of the setting sun.





Here are the words to

RED RIVER VALLEY,

the traditional cowboy song that

Lonesome Luke played on the piano.





From this valley they say you are going.

I shall miss your sweet face and bright smile.

For they say you are taking the sunshine

That has brightened my pathway awhile.





Refrain (after each verse):





Come and sit by my side if you love me.

Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

For remember the Red River Valley

And the cowboy who loved you so true.





There never could be such a longing

In the heart of a poor cowboy’s breast.

As dwells in this heart you are breaking

While I wait in my home in the West.





Do you think of this valley you’re leaving,

Oh, how lonely and dreary it will be?

Do you think of the kind hearts you’re grieving,

And the pain you are causing to me?





From this valley they say you are going.

I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.

For they say you are weary and tired

And must find a new range for a while.

Jack and Annie were walking home from the grocery store. Jack’s pack was heavy. It held a big jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread.

“Are you going to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” said Annie. “Or a peanut butter and honey sandwich?”

Jack started to answer, but stopped.

“Oh, man,” he whispered.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“Look at that!” said Jack.

He pointed to the edge of the Frog Creek woods. In the shadows stood a small, delicate animal. It looked like a tiny deer.

“It’s a sign,” whispered Annie. “Remember when we saw the rabbit? He was a sign of the Wild West.”

The deerlike creature leaped into the woods.

Jack and Annie didn’t stop to think. They followed as fast as they could. Jack’s heavy pack thumped against his back as he ran.

Finally, they stopped and looked around.

“Where did she go?” he said.

“I don’t see her,” said Annie.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She pointed up.

There was the magic tree house. It was shining in the noon sun, at the top of the tallest tree in the woods. Its rope ladder swayed in the shadows below.

“Where’s Morgan?” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay wasn’t waving at them from the window. She wasn’t even at the window.

“I don’t know. Let’s go up,” said Jack.

They climbed the ladder and went into the tree house.

Sunlight streamed through the window. It lit a stack of books and two scrolls in the corner. The ancient scrolls held the answers to riddles Jack and Annie had solved earlier.

Jack took off his heavy pack.

“Did Morgan leave us a third riddle?” said Annie.

“Looking for someone?” said a soft voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around.

“Morgan!” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay had appeared out of nowhere. She looked ancient and lovely in the bright light.

“Do you still want to become Master Librarians?” she asked Jack and Annie. “So you can help me in my work?”

“Yes!” they said together.

“Wonderful,” Morgan said. Then she reached into her robe and pulled out a scroll.

“You’ve solved two riddles so far,” she said. “Here is your third.” She handed the scroll to Annie. “And for your research—”

She pulled a book out from her robe and handed it to Jack. The book’s cover said THE PLAINS OF AFRICA.



“Africa?” said Jack. “Oh, man, I’ve always wanted to go there.”

He opened the book. He and Annie stared at a picture.

It showed hordes of zebras, tall giraffes, big animals with horns, and tiny, deerlike creatures.

“Hey, that’s the animal that led us here!” said Annie.

“A Thomson’s gazelle, I believe,” Morgan said.

“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

“You’ll find out,” said Morgan.

“Um … maybe we need to plan this trip,” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “No. Go ahead. Make your wish now.”

Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go there,” she said.

“Be careful,” said Morgan. “Just keep an eye out.”

“For what?” said Jack.

“The lions, of course,” she said.

“Wait!” said Jack.

Too late.

The wind had started to blow.

The tree house had started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.
