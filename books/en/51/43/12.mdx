Irish Fairies

• There was a time when many people in Ireland believed in fairies who lived inside mounds of earth. The name for Irish fairies is Sí. In Ireland, the word Sí is pronounced Shee. To avoid confusion in my story, I refer to the fairies as the Shee.

• Leprechauns are a type of male Irish fairy. In folktales they often work as shoemakers or tailors and are thought to have hidden pots of gold. Leprechauns are featured on St. Patrick’s Day, a national holiday in Ireland celebrated on March 17.

Lady Gregory

• When she was a child, Lady Gregory’s full name was Isabella Augusta Persse, though everyone called her Augusta. After she grew up, she married Sir William Henry Gregory. As the wife of a knight, she was called Lady Gregory.

• Ireland’s most famous poet is William Butler Yeats (YATES). He was a very good friend of Lady Gregory’s. Together in 1904, they founded Dublin’s Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland.

• William Butler Yeats often accompanied Lady Gregory when she visited cottages and collected Irish folklore. It was said that Lady Gregory had a natural genius for remembering the direct speech of storytellers. “In her many years of traveling, listening, transcribing and publishing, Lady Gregory … gave value to the stories, to the mind and the imagination of Irish country people” (Lucy McDiarmid and Maureen Waters, introduction to Lady Gregory: Selected Writings).

Irish Language

• From the 1600s to the early 1900s, the language of Ireland, called Irish Gaelic, was replaced by English in many parts of Ireland. During the struggle for Irish independence in the twentieth century, the desire to learn the old language became very strong in Ireland. In 1922, Irish Gaelic became the official language of the country along with English. Today it is taught in Irish public schools. Lady Gregory’s knowledge of Irish Gaelic helped her when she visited cottages and collected stories.
