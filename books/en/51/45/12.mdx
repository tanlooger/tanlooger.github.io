title: 12. The Meaning of the Emerald
---




Jack, Annie, and the Great Mogul were silent for a long moment. The marble of the Taj Mahal seemed to change color as the sun went down. Against the darkening sky, it went from pale pink to orange to purple. The dome sparkled as if it were covered with a thousand tiny lights.



“How did you make it sparkle like that?” Annie asked finally.

“Stonecutters set precious stones in the marble,” said the Great Mogul. “Many were cut in the shapes of flowers and leaves. The emerald rose you chose today is like the carved flowers set in the Taj Mahal.”

“It’s really beautiful,” Jack said.

“Yes. Many say it is the most beautiful building in all the world,” said the Great Mogul. “But hidden beneath the sparkle and magnificence of the Taj Mahal is simply the lonely heart of one person who loved another.” The Great Mogul had tears in his eyes. He cleared his throat and looked away from them. “And the elephant I gave you—where is she now?”

“Uh … actually …,” Jack started. He didn’t know what to say. How could he protect Morning Breeze?

“We left her in the forest,” Annie finished. “She has a baby she wanted to take care of. You probably didn’t know this, but Morning Breeze was a new mom when she was captured. She’s a good mother. She should stay with her baby.”

The Great Mogul nodded. “I understand,” he said. “My wife was a good mother, too. The last thing she said to me was ‘Please take care of our children.’ Do not worry, the elephant will remain in the forest with her child.”

“Thank you,” said Annie.

The Great Mogul stared at them for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice was kind. “You are ambassadors from far away,” he said, “but you are children, too. You should go back to your home, to those who care for you.”

“A splendid idea,” said Jack, trying to sound like an ambassador.

“Come.” The Great Mogul walked with Jack and Annie back to the arched entrance and through the tall gate. He waved at the driver in the cart. Then he turned to Jack and Annie.

“Farewell,” he said. “Travel safely.”

“Thank you,” said Annie.

“Bow,” Jack whispered to her.

Jack and Annie performed their bow one last time. When they straightened up, the Great Mogul nodded.

“Oh, and thank you for the emerald rose,” said Annie. “It is a priceless treasure.”

“You are most welcome,” said the Great Mogul. “The rose was my wife’s favorite flower. And, as you know, emeralds stand for love.” For the first time, a warm smile crossed his face.

Jack and Annie smiled back at him.

But the Great Mogul was suddenly serious again, as if he wasn’t allowed to smile. He looked at Jack and Annie for a moment. Then, without another word, he turned and walked through the tall gate, back toward the shimmering tomb of his wife.

Jack looked at Annie. “Let’s go home now,” he said.

Jack and Annie walked to the guard and his horse-drawn carriage. “Please take us to the trees outside the walls of the Red Fort,” Jack said.

The guard flicked his reins. The black horses trotted along the river in the pink twilight. They passed veiled women on the backs of elephants, white oxen pulling a cart, and small boys driving a herd of sheep. They stopped near the row of dark trees outside the Red Fort.

“This is fine. We’ll get out here, please,” said Jack.

The guard gave them a silent nod.

Jack and Annie jumped out of the cart. They ran under the trees to the rope ladder and climbed into the tree house. Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. Before he made the wish, he and Annie looked out the window.

In the distance, they could just see the Taj Mahal. It glowed faintly in the hot night, like a shimmering cloud.

“Oh, wait …,” said Jack. “I just remembered something.” He reached into his bag and pulled out the note from Kathleen and Teddy. He read aloud:

Ye say that ye wish

your spell be reversed?

Four things ye must find.

Here is the first:



In the shape of a rose

is an emerald stone

that uncovers the heart

of one who’s alone.



Jack put the note away. “Our mission wasn’t really done until now,” he said. “We were so worried about the emerald rose, we forgot the part about uncovering the heart of one who’s alone.”

“The Great Mogul,” said Annie. “Even though he has millions of followers, he’s really lonely.”

Jack and Annie looked out the window again. “Good-bye, Great Mogul,” Annie said. “I hope your heart feels better someday.”

Jack took a deep breath. He pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



Jack and Annie were wearing their own clothes again. Jack’s bag was a backpack. A warm wind was blowing the trees in the Frog Creek woods.

“I’m glad it’s not boiling hot here,” said Jack.

“It feels good,” said Annie. “You’ve still got the emerald rose, right?”

Jack looked in his backpack. “Got it,” he said. He pulled out their note, their research book, and the blue bottle, and he left them in the corner of the tree house.

Then Jack took out the sparkling stone and held it up to the afternoon light. “This is for you, Penny,” Jack said. “We’ll take this home and keep it safe until we see Teddy and Kathleen again.”

“Good,” said Annie.

Jack carefully put the emerald rose back into his backpack. Then he looked at Annie. “Home,” he said.

Jack and Annie climbed down the rope ladder. As they walked through the Frog Creek woods, Annie was unusually quiet.

“What’s on your mind?” Jack asked.

“Well, I was just thinking that it’s really cool that emeralds stand for love,” said Annie. “Love was the reason for every big thing that happened today.”

“How do you mean?” said Jack. He thought their day had been crazy.

“Well, we went on our mission because Merlin—and everyone else in Camelot—loves Penny,” said Annie, “and we love her, too.”

“Right …,” said Jack.

“And the Great Mogul gave us Morning Breeze because I loved her,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

“And Morning Breeze took us into the wild because she loved her baby,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

“And we ran into trouble with the cobras because they loved their babies-to-be,” said Annie.

“Yeah …,” said Jack. “Okay.”

“And finally, the Great Mogul showed us the Taj Mahal, which is the most amazing building we’ve ever seen, and he built it because he loved his wife,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “You’re right.” Annie made it all sound so simple.

“And now I would love to go home,” said Annie.

“Me too,” said Jack.

“Hey, we can tell Mom and Dad you got an A plus on your story,” said Annie. “We’ll print it out again.”

“Yeah, and I made copies of your artwork,” said Jack. “Except the sparkles don’t really show.”

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “The sparkles aren’t that important.”

“Right,” said Jack. “It’s the heart that counts.” And the two of them left the Frog Creek woods and headed home under the cloudless May sky.
