title: 6. To Jail
---




Jack handed the policeman his green bag. “But it’s mine, sir!” he tried to explain. “I promise it’s mine!”

“No, it’s mine!” said the kid who’d stolen the bag. “It belonged to my dear, departed father.”

“It is not yours!” Jack said, furious.

“It is!” the boy shouted. “Take him to jail, Officer!”

“Stand back!” the policeman shouted at the kid. “Don’t worry, I will be puttin’ him in jail. But I might be puttin’ you there, too!”

“Jail?” said Jack.

“But, sir, it really is our bag,” said Annie. “Those two kids stole it from us, and my brother just grabbed it back and—”

“Quiet!” the policeman said. “Someone stole it—whether it’s him or him, or maybe you, we’ll soon find out.”

“But I can tell you what’s in it!” said Jack. “I can prove—”

“Quiet! You can make your case to the chief inspector at Scotland Yard!” said the policeman. “Step aside! Let us through!” he yelled at the crowd.

As the crowd parted to make a path, Jack saw the tough kid and his friend slip away down the alley. “They’re running away, sir!” he said.

But the policeman ignored him. “March!” he ordered.

Annie grabbed Jack’s hand and walked close to him. “I’m sorry,” she said, near tears. “I’m so sorry I made us give up our nice clothes.”

“Don’t worry,” said Jack. “You didn’t know this would happen.” He wasn’t mad at Annie. He was mad at the boys who had tried to steal his bag. And he was mad at Merlin, Teddy, and Kathleen! Why had they sent him and Annie to such a terrible place? He didn’t care at all about helping crazy Mr. Dickens anymore. He just wished they were back home in Frog Creek.

“This way!” the policeman ordered. He gave Jack a little push. Jack and Annie turned out of the alley and headed down the street. They walked through the smothering coal smoke and grimy rain.

“Left!” the policeman shouted.

Jack and Annie turned left. The crowd still followed them. Jack kept his head down. He couldn’t bear to look at the gawkers.

“Hello!” Annie suddenly shouted. “It’s us! Remember us?”

Jack looked up. Who was Annie shouting to?

Standing on the other side of the street was Mr. Dickens.

“It’s us!” Annie called again. “The chimney sweeps in your study! Remember?”

Mr. Dickens scowled, but he started to follow them, walking behind the crowd.

“Help us!” Annie shouted. “Please help us!”

“Quiet, boy!” the policeman barked at Annie.

Mr. Dickens moved briskly toward Jack and Annie, pushing his way through the crowd. “Excuse me, Officer!” he said.

The policeman stopped. He squinted at the small, well-dressed man. “Mr. Dickens? Mr. Charles Dickens?” he said with wonder.

Gasps and whispers went up from the crowd. “It’s him. It’s Charles Dickens, the writer!” the baker said.

“Yes, it is I,” said Mr. Dickens. “I know these sweeps. What seems to be the problem, Officer?”

“The boy stole this bag, sir.” The policeman held up the green velvet bag.

“When? When did he steal that bag?” asked Mr. Dickens.

“Just now, sir. I caught him trying to run off with it,” said the policeman.

“Well, I’m afraid you’re mistaken, Officer,” said Mr. Dickens. “These lads were working at my house earlier today. They had that green bag with them then.”

“Ah, did they now?” said the policeman, looking at Jack.

Jack nodded.

“This lad is innocent,” said Mr. Dickens. He turned and spoke to the crowd. “Do you see what has happened here? If I had not come along, the courts might have thrown this boy in jail for years. Why? Because he has soot on his face and holes in his shoes. How do you think this lad got so dirty? I ask all of you!”

No one in the crowd answered.

“I’ll tell you how,” said Mr. Dickens. “From honest work. And now all of you want to put this innocent, hardworking lad into prison?”

The butcher, the baker, and the cigar seller lowered their gazes. The policeman looked ashamed, too. “Mr. Dickens, forgive me. I shall release him at once,” he said.

“Yes, Officer, release this lad. Return his bag, and think twice before you arrest another child just because he is ragged and poor,” said Mr. Dickens.



The policeman handed the green velvet bag to Jack. “Your bag, boy,” he said. “Good luck on your journey through life. God bless you. And God bless you, Mr. Dickens. Good day.”

“Thank you, Officer. And one last word to all of you,” Mr. Dickens said to the crowd. “Remember, goodness dresses in rags and patches as often as it dresses in velvet and silk.”

The crowd was silent for a moment. Then some people broke into applause.

Mr. Dickens tipped his hat. He put his hands on Jack’s and Annie’s shoulders. “Come, lads. I will walk with you a ways, so no one else will prey upon you,” he said.

“Thanks,” Jack said hoarsely.

Mr. Dickens guided Jack and Annie away from the crowd. He steered them across the street.

“Thanks for helping us,” said Annie. “We’re sorry we ruined your work today. We didn’t mean to.”

“Oh, no, you didn’t ruin my work,” said Mr. Dickens. “It was just that the sudden sight of you reminded me of all the children who sweep our chimneys and work in our mines and factories. You suffer.…” He shook his head. Then he looked at them and tried to smile. “Forgive me, lads. I needn’t tell you about your own hard lives. Instead, you both must tell me about yourselves.”

“Well, first, I’m not a lad,” said Annie. “I’m a girl. My name is Annie.” She took off her cap, and her pigtails fell to her shoulders.

Mr. Dickens’s big eyes grew bigger. “Why, I am speechless!” he sputtered.

Annie shrugged. “Sorry, Mr. Dickens, but this is the real me.”

“Well—well, Annie, I’m delighted to meet the real you!” Mr. Dickens looked at Jack. “And are you also a little girl in disguise?” he asked.

“No!” said Jack. “I’m her brother, Jack.”

“I see,” said Mr. Dickens. “So you are Jack and Annie. Well! I would like it if you both called me Charles.”

“Thank you, Charles,” said Annie.

“So now, Jack and Annie, what exactly happened today with the policeman and the mob?” asked Charles.

“Tell him, Jack,” said Annie.

“No, you tell him,” said Jack. He felt too upset to talk about it.

“Okay, Charles, I’ll tell you,” said Annie.

As Annie told the story of how the boys had stolen the bag, Charles listened carefully, nodding and frowning. His eyebrows jumped up and down. His mouth twitched. He seemed to be feeling everything Annie was describing.

Finally Annie finished, saying, “And then you came, and you know the rest.”

“Remarkable!” said Charles.

“Yes, it was remarkable,” Jack said bitterly.

“No, it is remarkable because it is exactly like a scene in my book Oliver Twist!” said Charles. “Oliver is wrongly accused of picking the pocket of an old man. And the real thieves lead the chase, yelling, ‘Stop, thief!’”

“Really?” said Jack.

“Are you serious?” said Annie. “That happens in your book?”

“Indeed,” said Charles.

“Cool,” said Jack with a little smile.

“Does that make you feel better?” Annie asked Jack.

“Yeah, it does, actually,” he said. “It makes me feel like I’m not alone.”

“Good!” said Charles. “Now, tell me, Jack and Annie, are you hungry?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Of course you are!” said Charles. “I imagine you’ve had nothing but watery gruel for days! Let me treat you to a meal that you will never forget! Steak and gravy! Pork pie! Gooseberry jam! Come, we will dine like kings!” He looked at Annie. “And a queen!” he added with a wink.
