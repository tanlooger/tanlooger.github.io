title: 9. The Three Ghosts

“A ghost story?” said Jack. “You mean we’ll make ghosts appear?”

“Yep,” said Annie.

“Um … I don’t know,” said Jack. Ghosts made him nervous.

“I promise this will work,” said Annie.

“But I don’t get it,” said Jack. “A ghost story. How can we change Charles with that?”

“We won’t change him. The ghosts will change him, just like they changed Scrooge,” said Annie. “Our job is just to make the right ghosts appear.”

“But—” started Jack.

“It’s magic, Jack,” said Annie. “We have to trust the magic.”

“But Charles doesn’t even want us around,” said Jack.

“That’s okay,” said Annie. “He doesn’t have to see us. He can believe it’s all happening in his imagination. He has a great imagination, you know. Come on, before he leaves.”

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “But I hope we don’t give him a heart attack.” He unbuckled the green velvet bag and pulled out the violin and the bow.

Jack rested the bow against the strings of the violin. Then he began moving the bow back and forth. The violin’s music was soft at first, but as it grew louder, it seemed to come from every direction.

At the bottom of the hill, Charles lifted his head.

Annie started singing in a soft, whispery voice:

Come, three ghosts,

in a dreamlike swirl.

Help our friend

give his gifts to the world.



The streetlamp flickered and went out. Then a hazy glow surrounded Charles. He stood up and looked around. In the haze, a ghostly figure swirled into shape.

Jack’s heart pounded as he kept playing.

Charles cried out and stumbled back.

The ghost looked like both a child and an old man. He had long white hair, but there was not a wrinkle on his face. He wore a white tunic with a silver belt and carried a holly branch in his hand.

Annie sang on:

Do not fear him, Charles,

stand fast.

He’s come to share

a Christmas Past.



The ghost waved his hand, and a scene slowly appeared in the glowing fog: a small, frail boy was lying on a heap of rags.

“Who are you? And why do you show me this poor child?” cried Charles.

The boy rolled over and sat up. He had big eyes and wavy brown hair.

Charles gasped. “Oh, my!” he said. “Is that … is that me?”

The boy reached under the rags and pulled out a book. On the cover was a picture of a flying carpet. The boy opened the book and smiled.



“I remember that book! It is me!” cried Charles. “I loved to read The Arabian Nights! I felt as if I could ride on a flying carpet myself! Books gave me hope when I had no hope. But why do you show me this now?”

The ghost did not answer. He raised his pale hand in farewell.

“Wait!” cried Charles.

But the ghost faded into the haze. And the vision of young Charles Dickens faded with him.

The glow still surrounded Charles. Jack’s violin music swelled with deep tones. Annie sang on.

Come to Charles,

O second ghost.

It’s your turn now

to be the host.…



The haze became rose-colored. It swirled in the shape of a small cyclone. The funnel of vapor spun wider and wider, until out from its center stepped a giant in a green robe. He had a bushy brown beard and wore a crown of icicles. He held a flaming torch high into the air.

“Who are you? What do you want with me?” cried Charles.

The ghost pointed into the mist and bellowed:

You say you’ll write

not one more book?

Stop your weeping, man,

and look!



Charles stared as human shapes began to form in the mist: a young Victorian couple stood at a bookstall. “I’m getting the new book by Charles Dickens! I love Mr. Dickens!”

“I know you do, my dear! And so do I!”

The couple laughed joyfully, and another scene appeared beside them: a teacher stood in front of schoolchildren. “So what did we learn today from Mr. Dickens’s book?” she asked.

“We learned to be more generous and kind!” a small girl answered.

“Yes!” the class shouted.

As the children cheered, another scene took shape: Queen Victoria was sitting on her throne!

“I say,” the queen said to a lady-in-waiting. “This Oliver Twist book is exceedingly interesting. Poor Oliver. I had no idea children in our kingdom lived such dreadful lives.”

The queen faded away. The couple faded away—and the teacher and the children. Everything faded away except the giant ghost.

“They were all speaking about my books,” Charles said in a voice filled with wonder.

The giant ghost boomed:

Yet writing is nothing

but paper and ink!

A foolish task!

Is that not what you think?



“Yes! No! Yes, but …,” said Charles.

The ghost shook his head sadly. Then he, too, vanished into the fog.

Annie sang on:

Think about all

you’ve been shown by this ghost,

and get ready to meet

your last ghostly host.



The rosy glow faded to an eerie silver light. The air grew very cold. Then, like a dark shadow, a third ghost silently appeared. This ghost wore a black cape with the hood pulled over its head.

Charles raised his walking stick to protect himself. Jack trembled with cold and fear, but he kept playing the violin.

The ghost glided slowly toward Charles.

“Who are you? What do you want?” Charles cried.

A scene swirled into view beside the ghost: a group of people stood in a graveyard. A young woman was weeping near a tombstone.

“Why—why do you show me this scene of grief?” asked Charles.

The ghost pointed a bony finger at the tombstone.

Charles lowered his walking stick and crept closer. He squinted at the writing on the tombstone. He gasped. “It’s my name!” he cried. “My name is on that stone!”



“Poor Papa,” the young woman said to the other mourners. “How sad that he stopped writing when he was so young. So many beautiful words might have been written. So many wonderful characters might have lived. If only he’d given more stories to the world, he might have touched the hearts of millions.” The woman broke down in tears again.

“Stop! Stop!” cried Charles. “I can’t bear it!”

The scene began to fade.

“Wait!” Charles shouted to the ghost. “I’ve changed my mind! Tell her I will keep writing! Wait!”

But the ghost and the mourners and the tombstone had already disappeared into the fog. Charles Dickens stood alone in the cold silver light.

Jack played one long, low note on the magic violin.

Then there was silence.
