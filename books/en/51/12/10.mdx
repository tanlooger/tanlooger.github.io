title: 10. Master Librarians

Warm air washed over Jack. It felt wonderful.

“You have succeeded in your quest,” said a soft, soothing voice. “Are you glad to be home?”

Jack opened his eyes. Morgan le Fay stood in the moonlight.

“Yes,” he said.

“We solved all our riddles,” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You have proved that you can find answers to very hard questions.”

She reached into the folds of her robe and took out two thin pieces of wood.

“A magic library card for each of you,” she said.

She gave one to Annie and one to Jack.

“Oh, man,” said Jack, feeling the card.

The wooden card was as thin and smooth as an ordinary library card. On its surface shimmered the letters M and L.



“These are your Master Librarian cards,” said Morgan. “You are the newest members of the ancient Society of Master Librarians.”

“What do we do with them?” asked Jack.

“Take them on your future journeys,” said Morgan. “Only a very wise person or another Master Librarian will be able to see the letters. These will be the people who can help you.”

“Wow,” said Annie. “Can we go on a mission right now?”

“Now you must go home and rest,” said Morgan. “I will come back for you soon.”

Jack and Annie put their secret cards in their pockets. Then Jack took out the Arctic book and put it with the other books.

“Good-bye,” he said.

“See you soon,” Annie said to Morgan.

Morgan gave them a little wave.

Jack and Annie climbed down the rope ladder.

As soon as they stepped onto the dark ground, they heard a roar. They looked up. They saw a blur of wind and light high in the oak tree.

Then all was silent.

Morgan and her magic tree house were gone.

Jack reached for his magic library card. When he felt its tingly warmth, he knew that amazing adventures lay ahead.

“Let’s go,” he said.

He turned on his flashlight.

“The woods don’t feel scary like they did before,” said Annie as they walked through the trees. “I’m not afraid anymore.”

“Me neither,” said Jack.

“Hey, the darkness is like a mask,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “It hides the day, but it brings out your courage.”

They came out of the woods.

Jack saw their house in the distance. It looked warm and cozy.

The porch light glowed. The moon shone overhead.

“Home,” he whispered.

“Home,” said Annie.

She started running. Jack took off after her, running to the place that they both loved the best.

Jack reached into his drawer and took out his secret library card. He held the thin piece of wood and ran his finger over its shimmering letters: M L.

“Master Librarian,” he whispered.

Jack couldn’t believe that he and his sister, Annie, were finally Master Librarians.

He wondered if he should pack the secret card to take on vacation. His family was about to leave for a week in the mountains.

Just then Annie stuck her head into Jack’s room.

“Want to check the woods?” she asked.

Every morning, they looked in the Frog Creek woods to see if Morgan le Fay and her magic tree house had returned.

“We can’t,” said Jack. “We’re leaving soon.”

“But what if Morgan’s there?” said Annie. “What if she’s waiting for us?”

“Oh, okay,” said Jack. “Let’s look fast.”

He grabbed his backpack. He threw in his notebook, his pencil, and his secret library card. Then he followed Annie downstairs.

“We’ll be back soon!” Annie called.

“Don’t go far!” their dad called. “We’re leaving in twenty minutes.”

“Don’t worry, we’ll be back in ten!” said Annie.

Right, thought Jack. Five minutes to the woods, and five minutes back. Even if Morgan sent them on an adventure, they would return at exactly the same time that they left.

Jack and Annie ran out their front door. In the bright morning sunshine, they hurried across their lawn and down the street.

“I had a nightmare last night,” said Annie.

“What was it?” said Jack.

“I dreamed fires were burning,” said Annie. “Everything was smoky and dark, and the ground was shaking. Do you think it was a warning?”

“Nah,” said Jack. “Nightmares never come true.”

They left the sidewalk and headed into the Frog Creek woods. The woods were quiet and peaceful. They walked between sunlit trees until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“Yay!” said Annie.

There it was—the magic tree house. And Morgan le Fay was waving from the window.

“Hail, Master Librarians,” she said.

Jack and Annie bowed playfully.

“At your service,” said Annie.

“Then come on up!” said Morgan.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up. When they climbed inside the tree house, they found Morgan holding a book and a piece of paper.

“I have an important mission for you,” she said. “Are you ready?”

“Yes!” they both answered.

Jack’s heart pounded. Ever since Morgan had made them Master Librarians, he had been longing for their first mission.

“You know I collect books for Camelot’s library?” she said.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Well, there have been many great libraries lost in history,” said Morgan. “And with them, we have lost many wonderful stories.”

“That’s sad,” said Annie.

“It is,” said Morgan. “But luckily, with the help of the tree house and you two Master Librarians, some of those stories can be saved. Such as this one—”

Morgan showed them the piece of paper. There was strange writing on it:

Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Is that a secret code?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “In a way,” she said. “Actually, it’s the title of a lost story. It’s written in Latin, the language of the ancient Romans of Italy.”

“Ancient Romans?” said Jack. He loved anything to do with ancient Romans.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “This story was in a library in a Roman town. I need you to get it before the library becomes lost forever.”

“No problem!” said Annie.

“Do you have your secret library cards?” asked Morgan.

“Yes,” said Jack.

“Good. Do not lose them. The right people will know what they mean,” said Morgan. “And, as usual, here is a book to help you.”

Morgan handed Jack a book called Life in Roman Times. The cover showed a Roman town with people wearing tunics and sandals.

“That looks great,” said Jack.

“And take this—the name of the story I need,” said Morgan. She handed the piece of paper to Jack, and he put it in his pack.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But remember: In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you. But first you must find it.”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Go now,” Morgan said softly. “And don’t forget what I just told you.”

“Thanks,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book on Roman times. “I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

“I almost forgot—I’m going to help you blend in!” Morgan shouted above the wind.

“What do you mean?” shouted Jack.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

“Oh, cool,” whispered Annie. “Look at us.”
