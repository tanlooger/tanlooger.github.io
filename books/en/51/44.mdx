For Jack and Cathy Desroches





When I was in high school, I spent most of my free time at our town’s little theater, acting in plays or working behind the scenes. One year, I was involved in a production of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, a timeless story that readers and theater audiences have enjoyed for over 150 years. After weeks of working backstage, I felt as if I had really visited the exciting, dramatic world of Charles Dickens’s Victorian England. One reason I decided to write A Ghost Tale for Christmas Time is that I was eager to revisit that world.

That’s the magic of using your imagination: whether you put on a play, write a story, or read a novel, you often end up feeling as if you’ve actually visited other places, met new people, and shared their adventures. After you finish this book, I hope you’ll feel that you’ve just spent time with Jack, Annie, and Charles Dickens—that you’ve escaped an angry crowd with them, feasted in an old inn with them, and seen three ghosts with them!

So get ready to wander the twilight streets of London, England, long ago. Horses clomp over the cobblestones, and soon the fog will be rolling in.…

—Charles Dickens, from “A Christmas Tree”





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. A brother and sister named Jack and Annie soon learned that the tree house was magic—it could take them to any time and any place in history. They also learned that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot.

After Jack and Annie had traveled on many adventures for Morgan, Merlin the magician began sending them on “Merlin Missions” in the tree house. With help from two young sorcerers named Teddy and Kathleen, Jack and Annie visited four mythical places and found valuable objects to help save Camelot.

On their next four Merlin Missions, Jack and Annie once again traveled to real times and real places in history. After they proved to Merlin that they knew how to use magic wisely, he awarded them the Wand of Dianthus, a powerful magic wand that helped them make their own magic. With the wand, Jack and Annie were then able to find four secrets of happiness to help Merlin when he was in trouble.

Now Merlin wants Jack and Annie to bring happiness to others by helping four creative people give their special gifts to the world. They have already helped the first three—Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Louis Armstrong, and Lady Augusta Gregory. Now Jack and Annie are ready to find the last person.…
