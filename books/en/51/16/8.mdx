title: 8. Save Annie!
---



The guards tried to pull Annie away from the chariot race.

Annie looked surprised. Then she looked angry.

“Let go of me!” she shouted.

Jack rushed down the steps of the viewing stand.

The guards were having a hard time pulling Annie through all the people.

“Leave her alone!” Jack yelled.

His voice was lost in the noise of the race.

He pushed his way through the crowd.

“Leave her alone!” he kept shouting. “Leave her alone!”

Finally, Jack reached Annie and the guards. He tried to grab her, but a guard blocked his way.

“Let her go!” yelled Jack. “I promise I’ll take her home!”

More guards arrived. The crowd began to shout, “Arrest her! Arrest her!”

The guards kept pulling Annie away.

“Jack! The story!” cried Annie.

Of course! thought Jack. The poet’s story! This is definitely our darkest hour!

He reached into his bag and pulled out the poet’s scroll.

He held the story up to the sky.

“Save Annie!” he shouted.

But Jack’s voice was again lost in the roar of the race as the four-horse chariots barreled through the dust.

Jack looked around wildly for someone—or something—to help them.

Then suddenly the crowd fell silent.

All heads turned to watch as a huge white horse galloped out of the dust.

The crowd murmured with excitement and wonder.

The white horse was the most beautiful animal Jack had ever seen.

He was pulling an empty chariot.

And he was galloping straight toward Jack.
