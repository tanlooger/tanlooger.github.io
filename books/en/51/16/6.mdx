Plato and Jack hurried past the crowds standing at the sides of the race track. Everyone was shouting and cheering.

“I have seats next to the judges,” said Plato. He pointed to a tall stand with rows of benches.

Plato led Jack through the crowd and up the steps to their seats.

“Wow, thanks,” said Jack.

He had a great view.

The Olympic parade had already started. Musicians playing pipes were at the front. Behind them marched the Olympic athletes—the best in all of Greece.

Jack sighed as he watched the parade going around the track. Annie would really love this, he thought.

“The athletes in front are the runners,” said Plato. “Foot races are the oldest event of the Olympics.”

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:



“Behind the runners are the boxers,” said Plato. “They’re wearing special gloves and bronze helmets.”

Jack wrote:



“Behind them are the wrestlers,” said Plato.

And Jack wrote:



When Jack looked up again, he saw a soldier staring up at him from the sidelines.

The soldier was dressed like the actor from the outdoor theater. He had on a long cape and a red-crested helmet that covered most of his face.

But something was strange. This soldier was short—really short.

“Here come the discus and javelin throwers,” said Plato, “and then the men in armor.”

“What do they do?” asked Jack.

“They race wearing full armor,” said Plato.



Jack smiled to himself. He knew Annie would think that was funny.

He wrote in his notebook:



Jack finished writing.

He looked back at the short soldier.

“In a moment, the chariot races will begin,” said Plato. “Winning a chariot race is the greatest honor of the games.”

Jack just nodded. He was still studying the short soldier, who seemed to be looking back at him.

Suddenly, a small hand came out from the soldier’s cape. The hand gave a little wave.

Jack gasped. It was Annie’s hand waving!

The short soldier was Annie.
