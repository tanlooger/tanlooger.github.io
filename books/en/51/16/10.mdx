title: 10. They’re All Here

Jack opened his eyes.

It was so dark he couldn’t see anything.

He felt his clothes. He was wearing his T-shirt and jeans again. The leather bag had turned back into his backpack.

“Hello,” said Morgan le Fay. Her voice came from the corner of the tree house.

“Hi!” said Annie.

“Did you have a good journey?” asked Morgan.

“I did,” said Jack, “but girls can’t do anything fun in ancient Greece.”

“I did one fun thing,” Annie said wistfully. “I rode in a chariot pulled by a flying horse.”

“That must have been wonderful,” said Morgan. “You were very lucky to be bringing me the story of Pegasus.”

“Who?” said Jack.

“Pegasus,” said Morgan. “He’s the great white winged horse in Greek mythology.”

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack. “I think I’ve heard of him.”

He felt in his backpack and found the scroll. He gave it to Morgan. He could still barely see her in the dark.

“It was written by Anonymous,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Morgan. “Many talented women used that name in the past. Her story will be a great addition to my Camelot library.”

“Plato helped us find it,” said Jack.

“Ah, my good friend Plato,” said Morgan. “He was one of the greatest thinkers who ever lived.”

“And Pegasus was the greatest horse,” said Annie. She sighed. “I just wish I could see him again.”

“You can,” Morgan said softly. “He’s here right now.”

“Pegasus?” cried Annie. “Oh, boy!”

Annie turned on the flashlight and used it to find her way down the rope ladder.

Jack grabbed his backpack and followed her.

When they were both standing on the ground, Annie shined her flashlight at the dark trees.

“Pegasus?” she said. “Where are you? Pegasus?”

“Turn off your flashlight, Annie,” said Morgan. She was looking down from the tree house window.

Annie switched off the light.

“In the night, you can see all the story characters that saved you on your last four missions,” said Morgan. “They are all here—Hercules and the silk weaver; Sarph, the serpent monster; and Pegasus.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and studied the dark woods.

“Where are they, Morgan?” cried Annie. “Where’s Pegasus?”

“Look hard,” said Morgan.

“I can’t see him!” said Annie.

“Yes, you can,” said Morgan. “The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.”

Has Morgan gone crazy? wondered Jack.

“Look up,” said Morgan. “Your friends are in the night sky. They are stars.”

“Stars?” whispered Jack.

He stared at the shimmering field of tiny stars overhead.

“Hercules is a constellation,” said Morgan. “The Romans imagined him kneeling in the sky, holding a club over his head.”

Morgan waved her finger at the sky. For a moment Jack saw a living, breathing Hercules outlined by stars.

“And there’s the silk weaver, with her beloved cowherd,” said Morgan. “The ancient Chinese believed that they were two stars on either side of the Milky Way.”

Morgan waved her hand again. The lovely silk weaver was outlined in the heavens.

“And long ago, the Irish believed the Milky Way itself was the serpent monster Sarph,” said Morgan.

Morgan waved her hand. A giant serpent glittered through the sky.

“And the ancient Greeks named one of their constellations Pegasus,” said Morgan.

She waved her hand again and the white horse’s head, wings, and galloping legs glowed in the sky.



“I see him!” said Annie. Then she whispered, “I love you, Pegasus.”

Jack thought he saw the stars move as if Pegasus was rearing back in the sky.

After a breathless moment of silence, Morgan lowered her arm. The night sky became a field of tiny glittering stars again.

“You have done amazing work as Master Librarians,” said Morgan. “I would trust you with any important mission.”

“Does that mean we’re going on more trips?” asked Jack.

“Indeed it does,” said Morgan. “Many more.”

Jack smiled with relief.

“When is our next mission?” asked Annie.

“As soon as I need your help, I will send for you,” said Morgan. “Go home now and rest.”

“Good-bye,” said Annie.

“Good-bye,” said Jack.

“Farewell,” said Morgan.

There was a sudden rushing of wind, then a blur of blinding light. And Morgan le Fay and the magic tree house vanished.

The night was still.

“Home?” asked Annie.

“Sure,” said Jack.

As they walked between the trees, the Frog Creek woods were pitch-black.

Jack couldn’t see a thing.

But he didn’t ask Annie to turn on the flashlight. For once, he wasn’t worried about finding his way home.

He felt as if someone—or something—was leading them through the woods.

Morgan’s words came back to him: The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.

Jack looked up at the stars again. They were beginning to fade in the growing light of dawn.

But he thought he could hear the beating of giant wings, somewhere high above.





MORE FACTS FOR YOU AND JACK





The Olympics

The Olympics of ancient Greece were held for over a thousand years, from 776 B.C. to A.D. 394.

Every four years, the games were held in several cities, including the town of Olympia, for five days in August. (The modern Olympics were named after Olympia.)

For two months, all fighting and wars ceased so people could travel safely to and from the Olympics.

The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.

Greek athletes believed that having a physically fit body was a way to honor their chief god, Zeus. Olympia’s statue of Zeus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Unfortunately, it no longer exists.

Greek Language

The word anonymous comes from a Greek word that means “nameless.”

The English language has many words that were originally Greek, especially words having to do with sports, such as gymnasium, marathon, and athlete; words having to do with science, such as psychology and astronomy; and words related to the arts, such as drama, theater, and scenery.

The word museum is also of Greek origin. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greeks built a temple to the nine goddesses known as the Muses. They called the temple the Museum.

Some Greek letters are similar to ours. The Greek A is called alpha. The B is called beta. That’s where we get our word alphabet.

Democracy

About 2,500 years ago, the Greeks adopted a system of government called a democracy. Under the Greek democracy, all citizens had a say in the government. At that time, however, women and slaves were not considered citizens.

Plato

Plato the philosopher lived in ancient Greece in the fourth century B.C. Plato founded a school called the Academy. In both his teachings and his writings, Plato explored the best way for a government to be set up. His ideas are still talked about today.

Zeus

Zeus was god of the skies and ruler of all the Greek gods and goddesses. Zeus and his family were called Olympians because they lived on top of a mountain called Mount Olympus. The major Greek gods and goddesses were later adopted by the Romans. Zeus was called Jupiter by the Romans.

Pegasus

In Greek mythology, a great winged horse sprang from the neck of a snake-haired monster known as Medusa. The horse was named Pegasus, which may come from a Greek word that means “spring.” Pegasus was tamed by a young man named Bellerophon.

Star Myths

In ancient times, mythic characters from different world cultures were sometimes identified as patterns of stars in the night sky. Once a hero or heroine took a place in the heavens, he or she became famous forever.

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Jack finished tying his sneakers. Then he looked out his bedroom window.

A small dog stood in the early sunlight. He had floppy ears and scruffy brown fur.

“Teddy!” said Jack.

Just then, Annie ran into Jack’s room.

“Teddy’s back!” she said. “It’s time.”

It was time for their second mission to help free the little dog from a spell.



Jack threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he followed Annie downstairs and past the kitchen.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Outside,” said Jack.

“Breakfast will be ready soon,” she said. “And Grandmother will be here any minute.”

“We’ll be right back,” said Jack. He loved his grandmother’s visits. She was kind and funny. And she always taught them new things.

Jack and Annie slipped out the front door. Teddy was waiting for them.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Hey, where did you go last week?” Jack asked.

The small dog wagged his tail joyfully.

Then he ran up the sidewalk.

“Wait for us!” Annie shouted.

She and Jack followed Teddy up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

They ran between the trees. Wind rattled the leaves. Birds swooped from branch to branch.

Teddy stopped at a rope ladder that hung from the tallest oak tree in the woods. At the top of the ladder was the magic tree house.

Jack and Annie stared up at it.

“No sign of Morgan,” said Annie.

“Let’s go up,” said Jack.

Annie picked up Teddy. She carried him carefully up the ladder. Jack climbed after her.

Inside the tree house, Teddy sniffed a silver pocket watch on the floor. Beside it was the note that Morgan had written to Jack and Annie.

Annie picked up the note and read it aloud:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

A gift from a ship lost at sea,

A gift from the prairie blue,

A gift from a forest far away,

A gift from a kangaroo.

Be brave. Be wise. Be careful.



“We’ve got the first special thing,” said Annie, “the gift from a ship lost at sea.”

“Yeah,” said Jack. He picked up the silver pocket watch.

The time on the watch was 2:20—the time the Titanic had sunk.

Jack and Annie stared at the watch.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy’s barking brought Jack back from his memories.

“Okay,” Jack said. He sighed and pushed his glasses into place. “Now it’s time for the gift from the prairie blue.”

“What’s that mean?” said Annie.

“I’m not sure,” said Jack. He looked around the tree house. “But I bet that book will take us there.”

He picked up a book in the corner. The cover was a picture of a wide prairie. The title was The Great Plains.

“Ready?” Jack said.

Teddy yipped and wagged his tail.

“Let’s go,” said Annie. “The sooner we free Teddy, the better.”

Jack pointed at the cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.
