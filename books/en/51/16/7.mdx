title: 7. Go! Go! Go!

Jack stared in horror at Annie. She must have borrowed a costume from the theater!

He remembered Plato’s words: A girl will get in terrible trouble if she tries to attend the Olympic Games.

Jack shook his head at her and pointed his finger, as if to say, Get out of here!

But Annie just waved at him again.

Jack kept shaking his head at Annie. He even shook his fist.

Annie turned back to watch the race.

“It’s not a joke!” Jack shouted.

Plato turned and looked at him.

“Of course not,” said Plato. “We take the games very seriously.”

Jack felt his face grow hot. He glared at Annie’s back.

Just then the trumpet sounded.

“The chariots are taking their places,” said Plato.

Jack saw the dozens of chariots lined up on the race track. Each chariot was pulled by four horses.

Jack glanced back at Annie. She was looking up at him, pointing at the chariots.

The trumpet sounded again.

The horses took off!

The crowd went wild. They were cheering and screaming and stamping their feet.

Clouds of dust rose up as the chariots raced around the track.

Annie turned back to watch the race. She began jumping up and down.

“Go! Go! Go!” she shouted.

A few people began staring at the strange small soldier with the high-pitched voice.



Jack couldn’t take it anymore. He had to get Annie away before it was too late!

He shoved his notebook into his bag.

“I have to go!” he shouted to Plato.

The philosopher looked surprised.

Jack was afraid to tell him that Annie had broken the rules.

“I had a great time. But I have to go home now,” said Jack. “Thanks for everything!”

“Have a safe journey,” said Plato.

Jack waved and started down the steps.

As he climbed down, he saw Annie pull off her helmet.

Her pigtails flew up and down as she jumped and shouted, “Go! Go! Go!”

Her soldier’s cape fell off.

Now lots of people were staring at her. Someone shouted for the guards.

Annie was too busy cheering to notice anything.

Jack moved as quickly as he could.

But two big guards got to Annie first.
