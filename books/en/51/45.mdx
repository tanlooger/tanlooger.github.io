I think you are the real Morgan le Fay. There is always magic in your books.—Erica Y.



One day I was really bored and I didn’t want to read.… I looked in your book. I read a sentence, and it was interesting. So I read some more, until the book was done. It was so good I read more and more. Then I had read all of your books, and now I hope you write lots more.—Danai K.



I always read [your books] over and over … 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times.…—Yuan C.



You are my best author in the world. I love your books. I read all the time. I read everywhere. My mom is like freaking out.—Ellen C.

Teachers and librarians love

Magic Tree House® books, too!

Thank you for opening faraway places and times to my class through your books. They have given me the chance to bring in additional books, materials, and videos to share with the class.—J. Cameron



It excites me to see how involved [my fourth-grade reading class] is in your books.… I would do anything to get my students more involved, and this has done it.—C. Rutz



I discovered your books last year.… WOW! Our students have gone crazy over them. I can’t order enough copies! … Thanks for contributing so much to children’s literature!—C. Kendziora



I first came across your Magic Tree House series when my son brought one home.… I have since introduced this great series to my class. They have absolutely fallen in love with these books! … My students are now asking me for more independent reading time to read them. Your stories have inspired even my most struggling readers.—M. Payne



I love how I can go beyond the [Magic Tree House] books and use them as springboards for other learning.—R. Gale



We have enjoyed your books all year long. We check your Web site to find new information. We pull our map down to find the areas where the adventures take place. My class always chimes in at key parts of the story. It feels good to hear my students ask for a book and cheer when a new book comes out.—J. Korinek



Our students have “Magic Tree House fever.” I can’t keep your books on the library shelf.—J. Rafferty



Your books truly invite children into the pleasure of reading. Thanks for such terrific work.—S. Smith



The children in the fourth grade even hide the [Magic Tree House] books in the library so that they will be able to find them when they are ready to check them out.—K. Mortensen



My Magic Tree House books are never on the bookshelf because they are always being read by my students. Thank you for creating such a wonderful series.—K. Mahoney





The hottest day of my life was also the day I saw the most beautiful building of my life. Many years ago, friends and I rode for months in a van, traveling through Asia. When we arrived in Agra, India, the heat was so unbearable I could barely think or move. A tour guide led us around to see the sights, and late in the afternoon, we arrived at one of the wonders of the world: the Taj Mahal.

When I got out of the van, I forgot all about the heat. I felt as if I had stepped from the real world into a dream. Through the heat waves, a twenty-story marble building shimmered in the pink twilight. The Taj Mahal was the tomb of a Mogul queen named Mumtãz Mahal, built by her grieving husband, Shah Jahãn, in the 1600s.

Since that day, I’ve always wanted to go back to the Taj Mahal. In this book, traveling with Jack and Annie, I finally have.

Thanks for joining us.

For Nikita, Kumar, and Susan






Only let this one teardrop, the Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time, forever and ever.

—Rabindranath Tagore,

Nobel laureate poet from West Bengal





One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods. It was filled with books. A boy named Jack and his sister, Annie, soon discovered that the tree house was magic, and just by pointing at a book, they could go to any time and any place in history. And while they were gone, no time at all passed back in Frog Creek.

Jack and Annie eventually found out that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay, a magical librarian from the legendary realm of Camelot. They have since traveled on many adventures in the magic tree house and have completed many missions for both Morgan le Fay and Merlin the magician. On these journeys, they’ve often received help from two young enchanters from Camelot named Teddy and Kathleen.

Now Jack and Annie are waiting to hear about where they will be going next—for their forty-fifth adventure in the magic tree house.
