title: 8 Ivanov, the Initiator
---



The irony is that even though he presided over the rearmament of his country, and for all of his evident love of a photo opportunity in the cockpit of a fighter, driving a tank, or trying out the latest service pistol, Vladimir Putin never really served in the military. He avoided the draft by enrolling at Leningrad State University, and while that meant he was required to train as a reserve officer – he graduated as a reserve lieutenant commanding a howitzer artillery control platoon – memoirs of the time stress just how cursory and minimal this really would have been. It meant a few weeks a year in classroom and fitness training, some basic target practice and participation in a few routine and choreographed wargames, and typically some weeks in the summer bringing in the harvest as a ‘volunteer’.

His time in the KGB was first as a political policeman at home, then a low-level intelligence manager in East Germany. He never had much contact with military men, and none of his close friends, allies and patrons were soldiers, either. Although he knew he wanted a powerful Russian military – while he felt the country needed one – he would have to depend on others to build it for him. This was especially because, while Yeltsin had turned to soldiers in the 1990s, the tradition was that the position of Minister of Defence was an essentially political one, filled by trusted civilians who could keep the soldiers in check as much as they argued their case. Men like Grachyov and Rodionov saw themselves as soldiers first, politicians later, and perhaps this helped explain why they had been unsuccessful. Putin needed men he could trust, but also who could handle the challenges of the time.

my name’s ivanov, sergei ivanov

As discussed in Chapter 6, the three men he chose, then, were in many ways symbolic of what Putin felt was needed: first the spy, then the accountant, and finally the engineer. His first defence minister, Sergei Ivanov, was a high-flying ex-KGB foreign intelligence officer, in many ways the suave yet tough spy, the Slavic James Bond, that Putin himself had always wanted to be. His job was to assert the political realities as the new government saw them, that Russia was under threat and needed to be strong to survive. He was followed by Anatoly Serdyukov, an accountant who had led the Federal Tax Service, who was eventually able to break the resistance of a conservative officer corps and force reform on them. This was a divisive and uncomfortable process, though, and he was followed by Sergei Shoigu, a veteran political operator with a knack for turning around dysfunctional institutions and giving them a real esprit de corps. If Putin is the father of the modern Russian military, these three men were at the very least its midwives.

Sergei Borisovich Ivanov was, like Putin, a KGB recruit from Leningrad, but of a very different stamp. He was quickly inducted into the KGB’s First Chief Directorate, its elite foreign intelligence arm, after coming to London in 1974 to learn English at Ealing Technical College. He served in Leningrad alongside Putin before being posted abroad under diplomatic cover, in first Finland, then Kenya, until he was ‘outed’ by defector Oleg Gordievsky and had to return to Russia. When the Soviet Union collapsed, he transferred seamlessly to the new Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR: Sluzhba Vneshnei Razvedky), becoming first deputy director of its European Department.

In 1998, he moved sideways into the FSB, becoming its deputy director and head of its Department of Analysis, Forecast and Strategic Planning. This was around the time Putin was appointed to head the FSB, and although he must have felt some satisfaction that the ‘low-flier’ was now Ivanov’s boss, Putin also respected the other man’s talents, especially his quick grasp of complex strategic situations and his cool authority, even when dealing with older, more senior figures. The former made him Putin’s choice to be secretary of the Security Council – in many ways Russia’s equivalent of the National Security Adviser – in 1999, and in 2001, he replaced Marshal Sergeyev as Defence Minister, a post he would hold through to 2007.

Former US National Security Adviser and then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recounted one telling exchange: ‘President [George W.] Bush said to Putin, “I have to know whom you trust. Who is the person we should turn to if there are sensitive matters between us?” “Sergei Ivanov, the minister of defence,” Putin answered.’1

He may have had Putin’s confidence, but Ivanov also had an unenviable mission. When appointed, Chechnya was dominating the ministry’s agenda, and although the war was being won, it was still an uncomfortable reminder of the weaknesses of the Russian military that it was having to level cities with artillery barrages and arm and empower local militias to subjugate even this small region. Even after the war had been effectively won on the battlefield, there were still huge challenges, including mitigating the danger of terrorism, and addressing the damage done to the image of the military. At a time when Putin was increasingly becoming angered by what he saw as Western hypocrisy and hostility, especially over NATO expansion eastwards – in 2004 Ivanov himself said Russia would take ‘adequate measures’ if it went ahead2 – he ended up being the defence minister who was able to ask the key questions, not come up with answers.

the spy and the generals

Admittedly, Ivanov was a capable and competent foreign affairs professional. Indeed, Condoleezza Rice (who once sneaked out unofficially with Ivanov to go to the ballet in St Petersburg) praised him highly in her memoirs, saying: ‘Sergei was tough and somewhat suspicious of the United States, but he was dependable. He never told me that he would do something that he did not do.’3

However, he was no more a military insider than Putin. He had more money to spend, that was true, but while the generals were happy to receive pay rises and new toys, they were unwilling to embark on the kind of structural reforms that were needed to translate that into a genuine transformation. Putin had charged Ivanov with creating a military machine that was capable of defending the Motherland from a full-scale military invasion but the trouble was that the generals were torn by two imperatives. On the one hand, ever since Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the coalition invasion of Iraq, they had come to appreciate the way new technologies, and especially long-range precision-guided munitions, were revolutionizing warfare. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq had fielded a relatively experienced and well-trained army built along essentially Soviet lines and armed with fairly modern Soviet kit. The success of the coalition blitzkrieg – they suffered 379 fatalities, the Iraqis more than 20,000 – was largely explained by Russian analyses as the result of superior Western technologies that gave them a crucial edge. Then Yugoslavia reinforced both the sense that ‘non-contact’ war fought through long-range precision weapons was the wave of the future – for which they were not prepared – and also that NATO, for all its talk of being a defensive alliance, was perfectly able and willing to intervene and reshape nations when it suited its interests.

So they fully appreciated the need for modernization. At the same time, though, they resolutely clung to Soviet notions of the importance of a mass army, and that meant conscription. The key value of the draft, after all, is that it creates a pool of trained (or semi-trained) reservists who could be called up in time of war to create the kind of millions-strong army they felt the defence of the nation demanded. In other words, they wanted more soldiers and also better kit. The additional funds at Ivanov’s disposal would not cover both, and in any case the spy, who seems to have had something of an instinctive disdain for the soldiers under his command, became increasingly exasperated by their desire to have their cake and eat it.

Traditionally, the job of translating political decisions into military policy, and selling them to the High Command, was the job of the top soldier, the Chief of the General Staff. Ivanov, though, initially found himself saddled with one who felt that civilians had no place trying to foist changes on the armed forces. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin had been Chief of the General Staff since 1997. Perhaps best known for his tough line during both Chechen wars, he had also been a key mover behind the 1999 ‘Pristina Dash’ which had earned him Boris Yeltsin’s favour for having, according to one media commentator, ‘put a hedgehog into the enemy’s trousers’.4 (A phrase used every now and then since 1962, when Soviet leader Khrushchev, always prone to folksy expressions, asked his defence minister if it was time ‘to put a hedgehog in the Americans’ trousers’ by sending Soviet nuclear missiles to Cuba.5 ) He had wanted the minister’s job, and had even appealed to Yeltsin over the head of his chief of staff, Alexander Voloshin, to try to get it. When Sergeyev was appointed instead, Kvashnin made no secret of his anger and did his best to foil many of his intended changes. He encouraged the General Staff apparatus to drag its feet, and when Ivanov replaced Sergeyev, he managed to reverse many of them.6

He proved no more comfortable a subordinate for Ivanov. He made it clear that he regarded the minister as his peer, not his superior, an interpretation unfortunately possible thanks to the wording of the Law on Defence. He openly disagreed with official policy, and even ordered the General Staff apparatus not to act on official instructions from the minister unless he had countersigned them. He could get away with this kind of behaviour under Sergeyev and Yeltsin, but not Ivanov and Putin. Although there was a shared agreement between them that it was best to avoid major military shake-ups while the Second Chechen War was at its peak, by 2003 the main combat phase of the war was over, and it was time to push ahead.

ivanov’s reforms

In January 2004, Ivanov signalled that change was in the air when he used his keynote speech at the annual Academy of Military Sciences conference to criticize the General Staff for getting bogged down in day-to-day administration and neglecting the big picture. Shortly thereafter, the Law on Defence was amended to make it clear that the minister was in charge. In July, Kvashnin was replaced by Col. Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, a man with a reputation as a good strategic planner and, crucially, for being less of a bull in a china shop.

A reform blueprint had already been proposed in 2003 in a paper called Urgent Tasks for the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, based heavily on the experiences of the Chechen wars and the problems they had illustrated. The key issue was qualitative: modern war required soldiers with the skills and experiences that could not necessarily be imparted in a conscript’s induction training, and units which had worked and trained together rather than be subject to the six-monthly churn of the draft cycle. Given that there was no chance of raising an all-professional army large enough to meet Russia’s security needs yet which the country could afford, in effect Grachyov’s original notion of a force divided between a mass, conscript-heavy army and a smaller contingent of all-professional permanent-readiness units was still the only viable option. The trouble was that the High Command was still ultimately trying to have that same cake and eat it: maintaining the draft and a huge military to continue to generate a large reserve, while also attracting and retaining large numbers of volunteer kontraktniki, who would need to be paid a decent wage. Although Russia’s official position was that no major wars with NATO or China were at all likely, and that the real threats came from terrorism and smaller-scale local conflicts, the generals – perhaps aware that a smaller military would need far fewer of them – were still determined to prepare for the former.

There was also a challenge of arsenals and depots still packed with increasingly obsolete Soviet-era weaponry. These still had to be inventoried, guarded and maintained, even though their real combat value was deeply questionable. The 5350th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base at Abakan in Khakassia, for example, became something of a public scandal when it became known that it was still storing 1950s-vintage S-60 57mm anti-aircraft guns that had been replaced by modern systems and SAMs back in the 1970s. It was not just institutional inertia that kept them, though: if Russia ever envisaged mobilizing millions of reservists, they needed huge stocks of weapons, however aged.

Squaring this circle demanded tough decisions and tough leadership to force them on the High Command. Ivanov was still too dependent on the generals and too distracted by other duties for this. After all, he was still one of Putin’s inner circle, a key adviser on security and foreign policy and, as mentioned, in 2005 would also be appointed Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the defence industries. This meant that he was in the unenviable position of being both in charge of the defence industries – who wanted lots of orders and large profit margins – and their main customer. As a result, reform was slow and piecemeal.

A single regiment of the 76th Guards Airborne Division became a test case for these all-professional forces, and although the experiment had mixed results, it was deemed a success in 2005 and more units began to be converted. Meanwhile, Baluyevsky was working on streamlining the national command structure, folding the existing Military Districts (VO: Voyenny Okrug) into three regional groupings. The Western Command would incorporate the Moscow and Leningrad VOs, the Baltic and Northern Fleets, and a central Special Air Force and Air Defence Command. The Southern Command would cover the North Caucasus and part of the Volga-Urals VOs, the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. The rest of the country would be covered by the Eastern Command, subsuming the Far Eastern, Siberian and most of the Volga-Urals VOs and the Pacific Fleet. Meanwhile, the roles of the service Main Commands – Ground Forces, Navy and so on – would be pruned. A series of experiments with a new Operational Strategic Command (OSK: Operativnoye Strategicheskoye Komandavaniye) structure was held, but inevitably faced resistance from entrenched interests, especially those Main Commands themselves.

size does matter

All of this may have made sense, but failed to address the crucial question: the size of the military. There simply wasn’t enough money to rearm, reorganize and replace conscripts with kontraktniki. The volunteers had largely signed up on 12-month contracts, and not only were conditions still poor, but there were growing opportunities in the civilian economy as the Russian economy prospered. Thus, the overwhelming majority simply chose not to sign up for further tours. For instance, in 2006, the 382nd Motor Rifle Regiment of the 122th Motor Rifle Division signed on 2,700 kontraktniki – of whom only 400 stayed past their first year. Nonetheless, the government had committed to this project and even though by 2005 more than half the entire defence budget was going on efforts to recruit, house, pay and retain these professionals, it simply wasn’t working. Worse, efforts to modernize the armed forces as a whole were being stymied by the sheer cost of this quixotic campaign. Baluyevsky’s reforms were shelved, even if in 2008 they would largely re-emerge as the ‘New Look Army’ programme.

Eventually, Ivanov brokered something of a half-measure. National service was vastly unpopular in the country, and Ivanov, like many within the civilian security establishment, was unconvinced by its value. The high-profile case of the terrible abuse of one draftee, Private Andrei Sychyov, gave him the political ammunition to address this. In 2006, Private Sychyov, a conscript working at the Chelyabinsk Tank School, fell foul of his platoon sergeant, one Alexander Sivyakov. On New Year’s Eve a drunk Sivyakov forced him to sit for three hours in an uncomfortable half-squat for no other reason than to humiliate him. Whenever Sychyov tried to move, Sivyakov would beat him. The blood clotted in his legs, and sepsis and gangrene set in. By the time anyone realized what was happening and called an ambulance, it was too late. Both Sychyov’s legs and his genitals had to be amputated. The local commanders would probably have hushed it up, had not one of the doctors at the hospital tipped off the local Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers, a charity established precisely to highlight and combat such abuses. Even so, the military hierarchy did everything they could to minimize the story, until Ivanov found himself fielding a question from a journalist about the case. Ivanov blithely affirmed that ‘nothing serious happened’, because ‘otherwise he would have been told’.7 It was a public embarrassment for a man who prided himself on the appearance of being in command of his brief. A hurried criminal investigation saw Sivyakov and two accessories charged and convicted for serious abuse of office. The sergeant was sentenced to four years in prison; his accomplices received one-year suspended sentences.

This generated an ugly spat between Ivanov and Main Military Prosecutor Alexander Savenkov. Certain generals had apparently tried to bully prosecution witnesses into withdrawing their testimony, and when Savenkov warned that hazing was actually on the rise, Ivanov tried to pin the blame on the Main Military Procuracy and claimed they were in the pocket of ‘forces that have set out to make dubious political capital of the army’s current problems’.8 Ultimately, this was a case study in the personal politics of the Putin regime: Ivanov was one of the president’s personal allies and Savenkov was not, so the former stayed and the latter had to step down. Even so, this was an unedifying spectacle that further tarnished the reputation of the military and probably ensured that Ivanov would not become Putin’s chosen successor. As for the unfortunate Private Sychyov, after months of medical care, and kidney failure, he was finally discharged. He moved in with his mother in a house ultimately paid for by the Ministry of Defence.

Over the top of the generals’ complaints, Ivanov announced that the period of conscription would be reduced to 12 months. This did nothing to address the fundamental problems, including the need to stockpile weapons for a huge reserve that would likely never be mobilized, and it also angered the generals, who felt that this did not allow long enough to train soldiers properly and have them actually deployable for more than a few months. However, it did free up some money – because even if conscripts were only paid a pittance, they still needed to be armed, trained and housed – and allowed him to shrink the size of the armed forces, but not enough.

This was only a small step, though, and although more money was being spent, it is questionable whether it was doing much to strengthen a Russian military that was still 1.1 million strong in 2007. Ultimately, Ivanov had made the intellectual case for reform, but was unable to impose it on a recalcitrant High Command. While Baluyevsky was no Kvashnin, even he began to show signs of siding with his generals over the political leadership. Ivanov had his sights set on higher things – he was at the time regarded as a potential successor for Putin, who was coming to the end of his second term as president – and was disinclined to fight them. He was also too distracted with other responsibilities, and lacked the specific skills to ensure that the money being spent was being spent wisely. He had made a start, no more.

As it was, in February 2007 he exchanged the position of Minister of Defence for an elevation to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister, although he never would rise to the presidency. This was at the time when Putin was increasingly unhappy with Russia’s place in the world order. NATO was expanding, with fully seven new members joining in 2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. At his speech in Munich that month, Putin had signalled that Russia would no longer accept what he saw as the West’s attempts to deny it its rightful status as a great power. Later that year, Russia would suspend its participation in the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty that limited the deployment of heavy military equipment across the continent, claiming that it had ‘ceased to respond to modern European realities and to meet our security interests’, and accusing NATO member states of anyway breaching its spirit and the letter.9

It was clear to the Kremlin that military reform needed to be made a reality. That would take someone willing to tackle the High Command and who understood how to turn the resources Putin was willing to spend on the military – between 2001 and 2007, the defence budget would almost quadruple – into meaningful change. It would also, it turned out, take a botched war in Georgia.
