title: 28 The Challenges of the Future
---



Is a future war with China plausible, given that at present Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are hailing the friendship of their nations and their solidarity against America’s alleged attempts to maintain its ‘unipolar’ hegemonic power in the world? For the moment, it seems not, but defence planners must think not of tomorrow or even the day after but in decades, not least given the time new weapons systems can take from concept to deployment, and the need to consider everything from demographic trends to leadership succession.

Back in 1991, I had been finalizing the research for my PhD thesis in Moscow, and rumours of coups were circulating throughout the city. As it was, I flew back to London on the Friday before the hard-liners’ ‘August Coup’. I still begrudge missing that, and wholly unreasonably feel Russia ‘owes’ me a coup. In any case, though, that very Monday, I had a long pre-arranged meeting with someone in the British Ministry of Defence, so at least I felt I was going to get the inside insight into what was happening. But when I asked, he looked sheepish: ‘The communications intercepts haven’t come in yet from Cheltenham’ – home of GCHQ, the United Kingdom’s electronic intelligence agency – ‘so, we’re watching CNN.’

It was at once heartening and depressing to find that, in the moment, even governments knew relatively little more than the rest of us. (Of course, soon enough they came to know much more.) It also highlighted the extent to which defence planners are squeezed between the Olympian realm of long-term geopolitical trends and the insistent tyranny of day-to-day developments. It is often said that Putin has played a weak hand well, and that Russia is in a strong position in the world. In many ways, that is true, but there are long-term social, political, economic and even demographic challenges the Kremlin must face. The potential risks along its own borders are also serious and arguably growing. What’s more they are, as in 1991, often going to come from unexpected directions or in unexpected ways. In that context, the job of a Russian defence planner is certainly not an easy one, either.

The Western Flank

These are not the happiest times for Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, sandwiched between Russia and the West. All three nations are, in their own ways, feeling the weight of Moscow’s aspirations towards great power status – and thus its belief that it needs buffer states and deserves a sphere of influence – yet also posing different challenges to Russia.

Under long-standing ruler Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus had long maintained its independence by playing Russia off against the West. Although since 1997 formally part of the Union State of Russia and Belarus, this meant almost nothing beyond some trade and visa coordination, and the presence of Russian air defence assets in Belarus: a radar station at Gantsevichy, the Vileyka naval communication centre, and the Baranovchi joint air force and air defence training centre. In August 2020, in response to blatant falsification of general election results, a massive wave of peaceful protests broke across the country. The security forces responded with violence, and as the West protested, Lukashenko was increasingly forced to turn to Putin for political, economic and military assistance. Although he is a wily operator and has maintained a degree of autonomy, Lukashenko is now essentially a Russian client, and one result is the growing Russian military presence in Belarus, including forces which were used to open a separate front against neighbouring Ukraine in 2022.

Nonetheless, this acquisition comes with its own challenges for Russia. While the protests have for the moment largely been contained, the regime has lost its legitimacy. Even some members of the security apparatus are unhappy with the situation. Others are still Lukashenko loyalists, though, and if Moscow should someday feel it needs to try to impose a less toxic and more malleable leader in his place, they may resist. Conversely, if protests explode again, potentially violent ones, then Moscow will presumably feel it has no alternative but to provide whatever assistance the regime needs to survive, up to and including troops, lest a new, pro-Western opposition take power, as it did in Ukraine.

As for Ukraine, it is hard not to see Putin’s personal crusade to keep it within Russia’s orbit as already lost. The Donbas adventure was an expensive mistake, and the Russian threat since 2014 drove Kyiv to reform its military with impressive speed and effectiveness. It also united once-disparate Ukrainian communities and brought more Western assistance. By 2022, it had built an army of just under 150,000 troops, many of whom were veterans with the kind of experience facing front-line Russian forces that no NATO counterparts could claim, even if much of their equipment is dated. As well as the 45,000-strong National Guard under the Interior Ministry, there was also a large reserve force that could be mobilized to form 150 Territorial Defence battalions. No wonder that hawks in Kyiv had been dreaming of some day being able to have their own ‘Croatian’ solution to Donbas, after the way Croatia first lost control of the self-declared ‘Republic of Serbian Krajina’ in 1992, in part because of Serbian involvement, but regrouped and in 1995 retook it. As it was, in February 2022 Putin decided on trying to impose his own military solution to the stalemate, apparently assuming that the government was as weak as it had been in 2014 and as easy to collapse. As will be discussed in the next chapter, he was painfully and dangerously wrong.

Finally, spare a thought for all-too-often overlooked Moldova, between Ukraine and Romania. Europe’s poorest country, it not only has to endure the continued presence of the unrecognized but Moscow-backed pseudo-state of Transnistria on its eastern border, but also periodically faces pressure from Moscow, especially as it is dependent on Russian gas supplies. After the election in 2020 of Maia Sandu, a former World Bank economist who favours reform and closer alignment with the European Union, Russia turned to its ‘energy weapon’, cutting supplies by one-third and refusing to extend the existing contract. Although a new deal was struck, Moscow’s determination to foil attempts by any countries in the region to move towards the EU continues to be an obvious driver for conflict – and in this case, a reason to continue to maintain a military presence in Transnistria as a lever in the future.

The Turbulent North Caucasus …

Not all challenges are outside Russia’s borders. Chechnya is officially pacified – but only by accepting its virtual autonomy under an erratic and brutal leader who not only has territorial claims on neighbouring North Caucasus republics but also expects Moscow to pay for his personal army, his grandiose prestige projects, and his and his cronies’ lavish lifestyle. (Kadyrov himself has a palace larger than the old Russian tsars’ Winter Palace and a fleet of cars including one of the only 20 Lamborghini Reventons ever made.) Periodically, his many enemies in Moscow urge Putin that something must be done to clip his wings or even take him down, after the latest embarrassing story about him, but the president – to whom Kadyrov regularly pledges his personal loyalty – either doesn’t want to act or feels he can’t.

After all, there is a real fear that without Kadyrov, Chechnya may explode into violence again, and there is no appetite for a third Chechen war. Even under his heavy hand, there are still occasional acts of terror in Chechnya. Perhaps more serious is the threat that the Chechen elite could turn on itself, as various strongmen and warlords compete to take Kadyrov’s place and control of the huge revenue streams from Moscow.

Victory of sorts in Chechnya did not wholly pacify the region, either. There is a continued sporadic problem with terrorism and insurgency across the North Caucasus, largely from jihadist groups which exploit the deep poverty of the local population, as well as anger at corrupt or unresponsive local administrations. Low-level violence is a constant issue, as is the danger that this will resurge as more organized insurgent or terrorist jamaats (Islamic militant groups). All this helps explain why Moscow has to continue to maintain an extensive military and security force presence in the region. The Southern Military District’s 58th Army is based in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia, and its many manoeuvre elements are the 19th Motor Rifle Division (Vladikavkaz), the 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division (Khankala, Chechnya), the 136th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Buynaksk, Dagestan), and the 100th Spetsnaz Brigade (Mozdok, North Ossetia). Beyond that, the North Caucasus National Guards Troop District includes the 2nd Independent Interior Troops Special Designation Division in Krasnodar, along with a further seven Interior Troops brigades, five regiments, eight battalions, eight motorized police battalions and four special forces units. Until recent relocations around the Ukrainian border, this meant the North Caucasus had the greatest density of forces in the country.

… And the turbulent south caucasus, too

Following the 2008 Georgian War, the South Caucasus appeared for a long time to be relatively quiescent from Moscow’s perspective. Georgia was distinctly unhappy with the post-war status quo, but in practice could do nothing for fear of Russian overt or covert retaliation. In 2019, for example, following protests at the visit of a Russian politician, Moscow suspended direct flights between the countries, citing security concerns, and placed new regulatory burdens on imports of Georgian wine and mineral water – two staples of its trade.

Likewise, although relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan remained hostile, from Moscow’s perspective this was no bad thing, giving it a certain leverage on both nations. When peaceful protests brought down the government of long-standing Armenian leader Serzh Sargsyan and opened the way to centrist new prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, Russia was neutral. Although it had worked perfectly well with Sargsyan, Pashinyan made it clear that although he planned reform in domestic policy, he would not change Armenia’s orientation towards Russia.

However, in September 2020, the long-standing and bitter rivalry between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which has deeper and broader roots but has focused on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, erupted again into war. Azerbaijan is a larger country, a richer country, and had been spending solidly on its military since the last war in 2016. Furthermore, it was backed by Turkey, which had not only sold it Bayraktar TB-2 strike drones but provided advisors and even mercenaries hired from Syria. Although the war only lasted until a ceasefire was implemented on 9 November, the Armenian forces were destroyed piecemeal by artillery (with drones spotting for them), loitering munitions (essentially kamikaze drones) and drone-fired missiles. Claims that it demonstrated that the drone was now king of the battlefield, though, were premature: Armenia had failed to prepare adequately, not least by failing to develop a proper integrated air defence system which allowed Azerbaijan’s unmanned aircraft pretty much free rein.

This represented an unparalleled Turkish intrusion into what Moscow considers its sphere of influence, yet the Kremlin was unwilling to intervene on Armenia’s side. It would have required a substantial military commitment, alienated Azerbaijan’s leader Ilhan Aliev, and risked a direct confrontation with Turkey. Instead, it brokered a ceasefire that saw Azerbaijan consolidate its territorial gains, but a Russian peacekeeping force of some 2,000 soldiers, initially from the 31st Independent Guards Air Assault Brigade, and around as many Border Troops, was deployed to keep the warring sides apart in Nagorno-Karabakh and along an agreed transit corridor.

The Kremlin has long regarded the South Caucasus as part of its ‘Near Abroad’ sphere of influence. Not an empire as such, but a region in which it was hegemon. Its inability and seeming unwillingness to control this six-week war and its forced acceptance of Turkey now as an active local player is a game-changer. Aliev, in his speech welcoming the ceasefire, mentioned Putin but fulsomely thanked ‘my dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’. What’s more, in 2022, Turkish company Bayraktar, which supplied the TB-2 drones to Azerbaijan, announced that it was going to open a factory in Ukraine, which has also begun to buy them. At best, by inserting itself as peacekeeper, Moscow has recovered some lost relevance and authority in the South Caucasus, but at a cost.

That Moscow had to escalate its commitment to retain its position brings home the extent to which, on its southern flank, it is engaged in managing decline more than maintaining control. In a pattern reminiscent of the changing orientation in Central Asia – where Moscow retains the overt trappings of hegemony, while behind the scenes Beijing’s economic power is increasingly dominant – so too in the South Caucasus, Russia is having to accept new players in what was once its unquestioned backyard.

Central Asia: Instability and Jihad

Continuing round Russia’s borders, post-Soviet Central Asia is still more solidly within Russia’s effective sphere of influence, but even here there is both the risk of instability and the danger of growing rivalries. The experience of empire – tsarist and Soviet – is still very present, with all five nations to greater or lesser degrees being patchworks of ethnicities and linguistic groups within pretty arbitrary boundaries. Although most of the region’s 75 million or so people are at least notionally Muslim, their governments are largely secular. There is a constant fear that Islam could be mobilized against them, and this, combined with the inevitable tensions generated by widespread poverty and corruption, has often led to risings from below – and heavy-handed rule from above.

With the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which has managed to hold on to a ramshackle kind of democracy despite periodic uprisings and waves of protest, the region is characterized by corrupt, personalistic authoritarianisms. As mentioned earlier, in Kazakhstan, President Tokayev has recently usurped the power of long-standing ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev (who had the capital city renamed in his own honour), and it will have to be seen whether he is able to consolidate this position. In Turkmenistan, President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov ruled with increasingly totalitarian whimsy (he renamed the month of April after his mother, and erected a massive gold statue of himself that rotated to face the sun) until his death in 2006. He was succeeded by his deputy, Gurbanguly Berdimukhamedov, who shows every sign of being a worthy successor, in that he banned black cars in the capital, Ashgabat, because it was ‘unlucky’ and has instead raised a golden statue of himself riding a horse. Uzbekistan, like Kazakhstan, was ruled by a relic of the Soviet era, Islam Karimov, until his death in 2016. His successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has made some moves towards reform, but the country remains corrupt and unfree. Finally, under President Emomali Rahmon, Tajikistan remains perhaps the most unstable of the countries in the region, impoverished and vulnerable to both drug trafficking and jihadist influences from neighbouring Afghanistan.

This poses a particular problem for Moscow. Historically, after all, Russia’s security apparatus has concentrated on Islamist militants from the North Caucasus, which had been the main source of serious terrorist attacks, including a mass hostage-taking at a theatre in Moscow in 2002 and suicide bombings on the Moscow metro in 2010 and Domodedovo airport in 2011. Many of these are loosely affiliated with either Islamic State or Al-Qaeda, but they have also faced serious suppression by the security forces. Increasingly, though, the Kremlin has started to be worried about the implications of jihadism in Central Asia and its potential spread amongst Russia’s estimated 400,000-plus Central Asian migrants and temporary workers (at least half of whom are unregistered). In 2017, for example, an ethnic Uzbek from Kyrgyzstan blew himself up on the St Petersburg metro, killing 14.

Moscow’s claim to a degree of authority over the region is not entirely based on historical connections and its own pretensions. It remains a significant economic partner – Tajikistan is especially dependent on the remittances sent back by Tajiks who go to work in Russia – but above all is a security guarantor. On its western borders, Russia is generally regarded as a bully and an interloper, but in Central Asia, while there are the inevitable grumbles about high-handed Russians (though polls show them to be more popular than the Americans or the Chinese), Moscow is a welcome protector. When Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Tajikistan appealed for more support, and Russia beefed up its 201st Base there, sending in more modernized T-72B3M tanks and S-300 SAMs, then staging joint exercises with the local military as a symbol of its commitment to Tajik security. At the same time, the parliament of Kyrgyzstan was ratifying an agreement that allowed Russia to deploy drones at its base in Kant, which began receiving Orlan-10s and also a general upgrade with new helicopters and air defences.

It was, after all, Moscow which acted as kingmaker in Kazakhstan, and the undignified and destabilizing US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 only seemed to support a widespread notion that the Russians are the only reliable security guarantors in the region. This has clear benefits for Moscow, granting it the kind of authority it feels a great power should be able to wield in its strategic neighbourhood. However, it also brings with it distinct potential challenges.

First of all, the instability of the region cannot be understated, riven as it is with ethnic, historical, clan and factional rivalries. The tragic irony is that brutal authoritarianisms tend to be secure, but if figures such as Tokayev and Mirziyoyev do seek meaningful reform, this is likely to generate instability, at least in the short term. Combined with the risk of jihadist spill-over from Afghanistan, whether in the form of actual physical incursions (as has happened in the past) or simply a spread in radical ideas, then Moscow might find its blank security cheques being cashed more often than it might like. (Although it would take an extraordinary threat to get Moscow back into Afghanistan.)

There is also a strong China dimension. Until now, China has been willing to let the Russians play the role of strategic hegemon and security guarantor, while it stuck to its economic agenda, making its own investments and above all developing its Belt and Road infrastructure projects meant to build a ‘New Silk Road’ connecting it to the economies of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. This means that it will also be expecting Moscow to live up to its promises, and if regional instability does begin to become a problem, Beijing will either be pressing the Russians to act or else perhaps – even more dangerously for regional stability – deciding to act itself.

China is, after all, becoming increasingly assertive on all fronts. It may feel it either has to protect its interests itself or even opt to use Central Asia as an opportunity to flex its muscles. It already has a small military base in Tajikistan, near the Afghan border, and in 2020 it agreed to fund a base for Tajikistan’s Rapid Reaction Group – Interior Ministry special forces – in the remote Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province. While initially it was said that no Chinese personnel would be stationed there, several observers have questioned this. After all, Dushanbe is having to tread carefully with Beijing. In 2011, it ratified a 1999 deal to cede China territories in the Pamir Mountains, to end a 130-year dispute. China formally relinquished claims to other territories, but in 2020 stories began to run in the press advocating reopening this issue. Moscow and Dushanbe protested and Beijing claimed it was just unofficial and unauthorized speculation, but given the extent to which the media is state-controlled, the fear remains that China could press its case again, if it ever wanted leverage with Tajikistan.

China, the great frenemy

When China’s latest anti-terrorism law included a clause allowing it to deploy its forces outside its borders, it was widely interpreted as a signal that Beijing may be looking to project its military influence abroad, and its more muscular recent moves over Taiwan and the South China Sea also suggest this. Central Asia may be where it begins to test out its new strengths in practice.

Western leaders are clearly worried by what they see as a burgeoning Sino-Russian ‘DragonBear’ military alliance. In October 2021, for example, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that ‘China is coming closer to us’, and criticized ‘this whole idea that we either look to Russia, or to China … Because it goes together.’1 The notion is not simply that NATO has to operate in a single, global security environment, but also more specifically that China and Russia are cooperating and coordinating their actions. It is certainly the case that both Putin and Xi Jinping have been happy to talk up their united front, both because they share a common mistrust of the West and also because they know such language gets the West’s attention.

However, in stark contrast to the notion that there is some lock-step Sino-Russian axis, I remember a conversation back in 2013 with a retired Russian military officer, who had been a planner in the General Staff’s Main Operations Directorate. His opinion was stark: ‘In 20 years’ time, Russia will either have become an ally of the West of some sort, or else a vassal of China’s.’ He wasn’t alone in holding that opinion then, and although quite what kind of ally Russia could be with the West in the current environment is hard to tease out, nor is he now.

There clearly is a growing rapprochement, driven by mutual suspicion and resentment of the West and common economic interests. Even there, though, the relationship is distinctly asymmetrical: Moscow needs Beijing more than the other way round, and as far as the Chinese are concerned, whatever oil, gas, weapons and the like they need from Russia, they can just buy. Even then, they are ruthlessly pragmatic: when they concluded a $400 billion gas deal in 2014, for example, the Chinese knew that Russia needed a deal for political and economic reasons and exploited this ruthlessly: as Putin himself ruefully admitted at the time, ‘our Chinese friends are difficult, hard negotiators’.2

Consider also the Vostok-2018 (East-2018) military exercises. These were massive, officially involving in total 300,000 soldiers, 36,000 tanks and other vehicles, 80 ships and 1,000 aircraft, operating right across the eastern half of Russia. To put that into context, that’s equivalent to about one-third of the entire Russian military (although that 300,000 figure was likely inflated), or double the British armed forces. This was also double the size of the previous iteration, Vostok-2014. However, most foreign attention was focused on the presence of a Chinese contingent in the exercises, with overheated media claims that this represented the start of a new military alliance.

Never mind that the Chinese force was of just 3,200 troops and 30 aircraft. Or that they were essentially excluded from the higher-level strategic command post elements of the exercise. Or that they were not involved in the naval portion – so they sent an uninvited Dongdiao-class spyship tagging along to watch. While, in a deliberate act of performative choreography, Putin and Xi Jinping were holding a summit in Vladivostok and pledging closer business and political cooperation, there was much less to this military cooperation than the headlines suggested.

To a large degree, this is a deliberate geopolitical gambit, an information operation, a bid by both countries to play up their relationship to worry the West and elevate their own stock. However, there are good reasons to believe that in the long term, things may well be rather less amicable. First of all, there are long-standing Chinese claims to swathes of territory in the Russian Far East, seized during periods of Russian imperial expansion. Although the last border disputes were formally resolved in 2008, wider questions about the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking, which transferred large areas to Russia, could always be reopened. The forces in the Russian Far East are hardly elite, though, and often relatively static. Along the more than 4,000-kilometre-long border with China, Moscow deploys essentially defensive units whose purpose is to be both a tripwire to detect and deter any incursions and also a delaying force, to buy time for reinforcements to be rushed to the scene.

The 18th Machine-Gun Artillery Division, for example, is the primary unit assigned to defence of the Kuril Islands, an archipelago stretching from Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula to northern Japan. They were annexed at the end of the Second World War, and Japan still lays claim to the four southernmost islands, which includes Iturup and Kunashir, two of the three largest. Although this is essentially a political dispute, nonetheless it means that the security of the Kurils has disproportionate priority, even if it poses specific challenges. This is reflected in the composition of the division, which is headquartered on Iturup Island, but also has a base on Kunashir. It fields two machine gun artillery battalions, an anti-tank battalion, an anti-air missile-and-gun battalion, an anti-air missile battalion, a battery of multiple rocket launchers and, for mobile defence, a single motor-rifle battalion mounted in highly mobile MT-LB carriers and a company of T-72B tanks. Even with the addition of K-300P Bastion-P ground-to-sea missiles, the expectation is that the division could hold the islands for no more than four days in the unlikely event of a full-scale Japanese attack. The thinking is, though, that this would be long enough for them to be reinforced or the pressure lifted by diplomatic means or posing an alternative threat to Japan.

Likewise, the 69th Independent Screening Brigade (the Russian word prikrytiya could as easily be translated as ‘covering’ or more figuratively as ‘fortification’) is under the Eastern VO’s 35th Army. Headquartered at Babstovo in the Jewish Autonomous Region, a village originally established as a fortified Cossack township on the Chinese border, it comprises three machine-gun battalions, a battalion each of 152mm 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled guns, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft missiles, and its sole mobile element, a battalion of T-80BV tanks. There would be little it could do in case of a serious Chinese incursion beyond go down fighting.

In any case, China’s rise inevitably distorts the relationship. One of the many reasons why the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia tends to do well in the Russian Far East is that there is a sense that Chinese investment is beginning to come with political as well as economic strings attached. There is also a growing concern within the security apparatus. The FSB, while cooperating with its Chinese counterparts, is becoming more vocal about Beijing’s own spying, including cyber-espionage, and publicly trying cases that previously would have been dealt with quietly. What happens when Beijing decides to lean on Moscow to sell technology it would rather not, or grant China contracts it would prefer to assign elsewhere? The fear is not of some sudden and cataclysmic break, but of an accumulation of small irritants as an increasingly confident Beijing begins to treat Russia as the junior partner – what then?

The most immediate problem is what happens if either country finds itself at war with the West. Beijing has indicated that while it supports Moscow’s wider concerns with NATO expansion and sympathizes with its position over Crimea, it is not planning to get involved in any conflict over Ukraine (not least, one suspects, because it is also increasingly investing in the country, which is its main supplier of corn). Indeed, it never even acknowledged the 2014 annexation of Crimea. It is unsurprising that, unofficially, Moscow has clearly been less than impressed with Beijing’s response to its war in Ukraine. On the other hand, were China and the United States to clash over Taiwan, then Beijing might expect Moscow to provide at least political and intelligence support, if not something more substantial. This would leave the Kremlin in a difficult bind, and anything short of providing the Chinese what they want – which would inevitable only worsen relations with the West – would open up a new and serious rift along a 4,000-kilometre border with a powerful and rapidly arming neighbour. These are uncomfortable thoughts for Russian strategic planners.
