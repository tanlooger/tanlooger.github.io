title: 4 The First Chechen War
---



The true depths to which the Russian military had sunk – and Pavel Grachyov’s failings as both politician and commander – were best and bloodily demonstrated in the debacle that was the 1994–96 First Chechen War. Pitted against rebels in the habitually mutinous southern republic of Chechnya, with a population of maybe 1.2 million, or a seventh of the size just of Moscow, all Grachyov’s forces could do was essentially secure a draw. It was a humiliation, and contributed not only to the further demoralization of the military but also to the backlash against the decay of the Russian state that led to the rise of Vladimir Putin.1

Resistance and Resentment

Fiercely independent and proverbially tough, the Chechens – who proudly compared themselves to wolves – had long been a thorn in Russia’s side. In the 19th century, as the empire tightened its grip on the North Caucasus, not least to secure its southern flank, it conquered the Chechens but never subdued them. As rebels or bandits, the Chechens and their Ingush cousins continued to challenge their notional masters, such that in 1944, Stalin launched Operation Chechevitsa (‘Lentil’), the mass deportation of the entire Chechen and Ingush population to Central Asia, on the pretext that they were planning to help the Nazis. Some half a million men, women and children were forced from their homes at gunpoint, and at least a quarter died in the process or in the early years of exile. It would be 13 years before they were allowed to return, after Stalin’s death, although even then they would often find Russian migrants occupying their old homes, and the gravestones of their ancestors used to build walls and pavements. No wonder a fierce resentment against Moscow continued to burn in the hearts of the Chechens.

In 1990, when still campaigning against Soviet power, Boris Yeltsin had urged regional leaders to ‘Take as much sovereignty as you can swallow!’ The Chechens took him at his word. In the immediate aftermath of the 1991 August Coup, they threw out the Communist Party administration and under former air force general Dzhokar Dudayev, declared independence. Yeltsin actually flew security troops to the Chechen capital Grozny to arrest him, but when they were blockaded in the airport, he backed away from confrontation and stood them down. Nonetheless, this was no more than a pause. Yeltsin had been happy to champion local autonomy when he was in opposition, but had no intention of actually allowing the Chechens to secede from the Russian Federation the way Russia had effectively seceded from the USSR.

Dudayev’s rule was marked by a mix of enthusiasm, amateurishness and criminality. Warlords, gangsters and corrupt officials became rich, but not a single new school or hospital was built. In March 1992, Dudayev’s rivals tried to unseat him, but they were forcibly suppressed. When the Chechen parliament looked ready to hold a vote of no confidence in him the next year, he dissolved it and maintained direct presidential rule.

To a considerable extent, though, it didn’t matter whether Dudayev’s regime was legitimate and effective or not. For Yeltsin, this self-declared independent state could not be allowed to survive, let alone thrive, lest other regions decide that they could also secede. Although Yeltsin claimed in August that ‘intervention by force is impermissible and must not be done … there would be such blood that nobody would ever forgive us’, nonetheless he launched what today might be called a ‘hybrid war’ operation.2 Moscow organized and armed a few hundred Chechens and Ingushetians opposed to Dudayev – or simply willing to fight him for pay. In October 1994, they launched an attack on Grozny, backed by Russian tanks and airpower. This was repelled by Dudayev’s loyalists, as was a second, larger assault in November. All the more embarrassing for Moscow, 20 Russian soldiers were captured, and it became clear that they were not even obeying the military chain of command, but were instead under orders from the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FSK: Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki) security service, the successor to the Soviet KGB. What had been meant to be a quick, quiet and deniable proxy coup was turning into a public humiliation. True to form, an embarrassed Yeltsin doubled down. He ordered the Chechens to surrender. When they refused, he formally turned to the Russian military to ‘restore constitutional order’. After all, Grachyov and most of his other advisers were reassuring him that this would be an easy win: reportedly, he told the Security Council at a secret session on 28 November that it would be a ‘bloodless blitzkrieg’. Likewise, Minister for Nationalities Affairs Nikolai Yegorov affirmed that 70% of the population would welcome Russian troops, and the remaining 30% stay neutral.3 If only.

High Hopes, Quick Defeats

That day, the Russian air force began the campaign, bombing Chechnya’s small air force on the ground (although there are reasons to believe its small stock of training aircraft could not fly) and closing its two airfields at Kalinovskaya and Khankala by cratering their runways. On 6 December, Dudayev and Grachyov agreed to ‘avoid the further use of force’. It was an empty pledge, of course: the Chechens were trying to shame Moscow into standing down, the Russians were trying to lull the rebels. Neither was successful. Even as they were exchanging platitudes, Chechens were digging trenches outside Grozny and an invasion force was being mustered under Col. Gen. Alexei Mityukhin, commander of the North Caucasus Military District (SKVO: Severo-Kavkazsky Voyenny Okrug).

Together with other forces, including the air assets committed to the operation, the Joint Grouping of Federal Forces (OGFV: Obedinennaya Gruppa Federalnykh Voisk) numbered around 23,700 men, including 80 tanks, but was very much a scratch-built force. Right up to the eve of the invasion, the General Staff was hunting for units that were close enough to their establishment strength to be deployed, and whose vehicles were (mainly) ready to move and their supplies (mainly) adequate. As one officer who had been in the attack later reminisced, ‘honestly, it was a wonder we could even move, we ended up having to cannibalize about a third of our trucks to get the rest on the road.’

This reflected a much wider failure on the part of the Russian military, from junior officers who lacked the confidence and training to lead their men in messy, dangerous close-quarters battle, up to a High Command that had trained for one kind of war and seemed unable to come to terms with another. The level of understanding shown by the most senior commanders about the proper use of airpower was, for example, apparently pitiful. In his memoirs, Yevgeny Fedosov, head of GosNIIAS, the State Scientific Research Institute of Aviation Systems, recalled being summoned to a council of war with the five men essentially in charge of the operation. These were Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Defence Minister Grachyov, FSK chief Sergei Stepashin, Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and Border Troops commander Andrei Nikolayev. They wanted to know how to deliver a pinpoint strike on Dudayev’s bunker under the presidential palace in Grozny. Fedosov explained that the latest Su-24M and Su-25T ground attack aircraft could launch high-precision strikes with weapons that could blast through into an underground bunker. However, it turned out that the 4th Air Army, which was deployed to the war, largely lacked aircraft fitted with ‘smart’ bombs, and while it did have Su-24Ms, their pilots had no experience using ‘smart’ weapons in combat. At this point, according to Fedosov, Grachyov’s lack of understanding became clear:

Leaning imposingly in his armchair, he declared: ‘Let me tell you how our air force is fighting. During an air strike on the aerodrome at Khankala, a regiment of Tu-22M bombers completely destroyed all of Chechnya’s aviation, and one bomb destroyed Dudayev’s personal helicopter with a direct hit.’4

When Fedosov tried to explain that sending 20 bombers, each carrying 20 tonnes of ordnance, to carpet bomb an essentially undefended airfield was actually wasteful overkill – a single squadron would have been enough – and was a wholly different kind of mission, this was met with disgruntlement. Eventually, the decision was to set up a special force of Su-24Ms with experienced pilots drawn from across the entire country. By the time it was ready, though, a flight of Su-25 attack aircraft had already blasted the presidential palace to rubble with conventional bombs – and in any case, Dudayev hadn’t been there.

The Plan

The attack on Chechnya would come along three axes. The largest force, commanded by Lt. Gen. Vladimir Chilindin, would move from Mozdok in North Ossetia, north-west of Chechnya. Its 6,500 men were drawn from the 131st Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, nine separate Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD: Ministerstvo Vnutrennykh Del) Interior Troop security battalions, and the 22nd Independent Spetsnaz Brigade. The second force, striking from Vladikavkaz, west of Grozny, comprised 4,000 troops under Lt. Gen. Alexander Chindarov, the deputy head of the Airborne Forces. As well as a regiment of paratroopers from the 76th Air Assault Division and a battalion from the 21st Independent Air Assault Brigade, it included mechanized infantry of the 19th Motor Rifle Division and five Interior Troop battalions. The third, under Lt. Gen. Lev Rokhlin, assembled at Kizlyar, in Dagestan, north-east of Chechnya. Rokhlin, a decorated veteran of the Afghan War who would become an outspoken critic of the conduct of the Chechen operation, commanded more than 4,000 troops, largely from the 20th Motor Rifle Division, along with six Interior Troop battalions.

The presence of the Interior Troops (VV: Vnutrenniye Voiska) reflected the operational plan, which was to focus on seizing Grozny, with the assumption that once their capital was taken, Chechen resistance would soon dissolve. Rokhlin and other afgantsy quietly grumbled that a similar strategy had been tried in the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, and that had not worked out quite so well, but Grachyov was adamant that this had to be a quick triumph. He had, after all, promised Yeltsin that the operation would not last beyond 20 December. The three contingents would advance on the city along six axes and besiege it. While the VV sealed Chechnya off and prevented any reinforcements from reaching Grozny, the army would enclose and then, if need be, seize the city. The plan was doomed from the start, but the inclusion of MVD forces introduced a further weakness given just what a mixed bag they were. Their best were very good indeed, especially the elite Moscow-based ‘Dzerzhinsky Division’ (formally the 1st Independent Operational Designation Division). Most, though, were units made up of conscripts chosen for their willingness to do the Kremlin’s dirty work as much as anything else. Many would be implicated in brutal abuses of the civilian population in Chechnya, sometimes out of a misplaced sense that it was the only way to force the rebels to submit, but more often because of the simple fear experienced by poorly trained troops more used to guarding facilities and escorting prisoner convoys than counter-insurgency operations against a tough and committed enemy.

The plan had been to invade on 7 December, but the troops simply were not yet ready. Only on 11 December did they cross the border and head for Grozny. Everything went more slowly than intended. Although the north Chechen plains are relatively forgiving compared with the mountains of the south, nonetheless bad weather often grounded the helicopters on which cautious commanders had hoped to depend for reconnaissance and close air support, vehicles broke down with embarrassing regularity, and small groups of Chechen fighters sniped at advance patrols and staged ambushes that slowed the pace of the advance to a relative crawl.

They did not close their ‘ring of steel’ around Grozny until 26 December, which gave the rebels ample time to evacuate some civilians, but above all to bring in their reinforcements and supplies from the south and step up their preparations to greet the Russians warmly. They had two hundred years of oppression and near-genocide to make up for, after all.

Taking Grozny …

So the Chechens were ready. Dudayev’s nation had in many ways become a bandit kingdom, and its 3,000-strong ‘armed forces’ – comprising the army, National Guard and Interior Ministry units – were rather less extensive than they might appear on paper. The army’s sole motor rifle brigade was actually little more than a 200-strong company, the same size as its Shali Tank Regiment, which had only 15 working tanks, largely T-72s. The light motorized Commando Brigade was a little larger, albeit mainly equipped with trucks and jeeps, and the artillery regiment had just 30 light and medium guns and a few BM-21 multiple rocket launchers. The Ministry of Internal Affairs Regiment was another light motorized force of 200 men. The National Guard accounted for the bulk of the Chechen military, a random assortment of units, everything from leaders’ personal retinues to local clan militias. While their grandiose and picturesque names such as the Abkhaz Battalion and the Muslim Hunter Regiment – neither of which was more than company-strength – might suggest ineffectiveness, though, there is a reason why the Chechens have long loomed as a larger-than-life menace in Russian literature and history.

A young Chechen would often be expected to start learning to shoot as a teenager, and their fabled toughness also meant that a disproportionate number ended up serving in the Soviet special forces and paratroopers. Indeed, Chechnya may be landlocked, but Chechens were twice as likely to end up in the Naval Infantry marines than any other nationality. They were often experienced; they knew how the Soviet and thus 1990s Russian army fought; and they were defending their homeland. They had also been able to concentrate their forces in Grozny – with volunteers, the defenders amounted to some 9,000 fighters – and were gifted with an unusually able operational commander in Chief of Staff Aslan Maskhadov. He was born in Kazakhstan in 1951 after his family had been forcibly resettled. Like so many Chechens, he nonetheless joined the army, serving as an artillery officer and retiring with the rank of colonel in 1992. Returning home, he joined the ‘independent’ Chechen forces, quickly being made chief of staff. He would prove an unexpected asset for the rebels, a meticulous planner who also had an instinct for when it was time for a daring gamble.

The urban environment is an unforgiving one for the attacker, and under the best circumstances, an initial assault force of some 6,000 Russian troops was outmatched by 9,000 prepared and dug-in defenders. Nonetheless, Moscow was working to a political timetable, and the High Command was unwilling to accept that a ragtag collection of rebel irregulars posed enough of a challenge to demand a change of plans. Those plans called for a pincer movement following the traditional preparatory air and artillery bombardment. Batteries of 122mm and 152mm howitzers hammered the city – heedless of the risk to civilian life – and Su-24 and Tu-22M bombers hit the city from the air.

Then the assault began, on New Year’s Eve. From the north, Maj. Gen. Konstantin Pulikovsky led a mechanized force drawn from the 81st and 276th Motor Rifle Regiments and a battalion of the 131st Independent Motor Rifle Brigade. From the west, Maj. Gen. Valery Petruk led elements of the 19th Motor Rifle Division supported by two regiments and two battalions of paratroopers along the railway tracks to seize the central station and then advance on the presidential palace. From the east, the 129th Motor Rifle Regiment and a battalion each of the 98th and 104th Airborne Divisions under Lt. Gen. Nikolai Staskov would make a similar thrust along the railway line to Lenin Square in the heart of the city and from there take the bridges across the Sunzha River. From the north-east, Rokhlin himself would lead elements of the 255th and 33rd Motor Rifle Regiments and the 66th Reconnaissance Battalion of the 20th Motor Rifle Division to take the Central Hospital complex, while units of the 76th and 106th Airborne Divisions would secure the Lenin and Sheripov oil processing factories and chemical works, to prevent the rebels from destroying these crucial economic assets.

On paper, this looked like a clear and decisive plan in the best traditions of the Red Army. Maskhadov, though, had other ideas. He had organized three concentric defensive rings around the city, while the centre had become a nest of ad hoc fortifications. Buildings were sandbagged and reinforced to provide firing positions, sniper nests established on rooftops, and what tanks and artillery pieces the Chechens retained were emplaced to command the bridges across the Sunzha River and those roads wide enough for an armoured assault. Petruk’s advance was soon bogged down. Staskov’s was first attacked while crossing the Sunzha, then detoured into a maze of minefields and strongpoints, where panic and confusion led to friendly fire incidents often as lethal as anything the Chechens did. Despite several times being snarled in traffic jams of its own making, the result of cobbling together a command from units which had not had the chance to train together, Pulikovsky’s force did manage to reach the presidential palace.

There it found itself dangerously isolated, though, in a crossfire of machine gun and rocket fire. A battalion of the 131st Independent Motor Rifle Brigade had been detached to take the main railway station instead of Petruk’s deadlocked command, but there it was ambushed by well-positioned Chechen forces in buildings all around the square. Their BMP-1 and BTR-80 personnel carriers were being riddled with heavy machine-gun fire and brewed up by RPG-7 rockets, and when the survivors fled into the station building, it was set on fire. When they tried to withdraw, they found themselves trapped in narrow streets with no room to turn, as Chechens dropped grenades and petrol bombs on them from high buildings. As Rokhlin recounted: ‘First, the vehicles at the head and tail of the column were burned … and then the blow fell on the middle. The armoured vehicles had no chance to manoeuvre. And they burned like candles.’5

The battalion lost more than half its men and almost all its vehicles; in effect, it ceased to exist as a viable unit. Although the 66th Reconnaissance Battalion did get mauled trying to relieve the 131st Independent Motor Rifle Brigade, only Rokhlin’s command was largely in good order. In part, this was because his mission had been less ambitious, and in part because he was canny enough to realize that Grozny was going to be a hard nut to crack. His forces had taken the Central Hospital, and dug in. Even so, by 3 January, the Russian attack had effectively been beaten back.

The assault had also claimed another victim: the reputation of the T-80B and T-80BV tank. First fielded in 1976, the T-80 only received its baptism of fire in Chechnya. Its gas turbine made it nimble, but also terribly thirsty, and it was not unusual for inexperienced crews to empty its fuel reservoirs by thoughtlessly allowing the engine to idle. At first, it had seemed to live up to its billing as a deadly tank-hunter: T-80s destroyed at least six rebel tanks, and one would withstand three hits from 125mm guns and still keep fighting. Once the T-80s of the 3rd and 133rd Tank Battalions were incautiously deployed into Grozny, though, they were prey to the inherent vulnerabilities of tanks in built-up environments, a specific design flaw (which meant it was vulnerable to attacks from above) and the lack of proper preparation (many were fielded without the explosive inserts in their reactive armour, which should have protected them from rocket-propelled grenades [RPGs]). The infantry who should have been providing the tanks with cover were often staying buttoned-up inside their armoured vehicles, and even when they were on the street, the Chechens – who knew their enemies’ weaknesses well – used sniper and machine-gun fire to disperse them before hitting the T-80s with RPGs, recoilless rifles and grenades from cellars below and rooftops above. The result was a bloodbath. Eighteen of the 80 T-80s deployed were lost, and while the tank’s defenders point to similar attrition of the older T-72, nonetheless the T-80 would never shake off the stigma of Grozny.

Moscow would not be denied, though. The air and artillery campaign was redoubled, and Mityukhin and the High Command abandoned hopes of a quick victory and instead adopted a much more cautious campaign. Reinforcements were rushed to Grozny, and the Russians methodically ground their way through the city, all but destroying it on their way. On 19 January, they finally seized the presidential palace – or what was left of it after it had been cracked open by BETAB-500 bunker-busting bombs, each half a tonne in weight. The Russian flag flew again over central Grozny, but the city was a ruin. Mopping up operations would continue for weeks, largely at the hands of the VV, while it would take months to collect and dispose of the bodies of civilians caught in the crossfire. Possibly up to 35,000 died in the bloodbath that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) described as an ‘unimaginable catastrophe’. This would not, however, be the last battle for this ill-fated city.

… And Losing Grozny Again

While federal forces moved on to take the battle to the rest of the country, in the face of continuing armed opposition, Yeltsin gave Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Anatoly Kulikov, head of the Interior Troops, overall command, in what was meant at once to be a rebuke to the military and an attempt to portray the operation as shifting to a mere policing one. As if this were the case; instead, there was a desperate search for more, better troops to throw into the war. The OGFV was expanded to 55,000 troops by March, including more Spetsnaz and the MVD’s Vityaz anti-terrorist commando unit (often being pressed into service as glorified light infantry), the army’s elite 506th Motor Rifle Regiment and even Naval Infantry.

In March, the cities of Gudermes and Argun fell, but even by May, Grozny was still under curfew and the acting field commander of the OGFV, Col. Gen. Mikhail Yegorov, was admitting that at least a fifth of the country was still in rebel hands. Day by day, Moscow seemed to be winning, but this quick and easy blitzkrieg was proving a frustratingly slow grind. In particular, the Russians fell foul of the same misunderstanding that had dogged their Afghan war, the assumption that controlling the towns and cities brought mastery of the countryside. If anything, the opposite was true. By day, army and MVD patrols on the plain and Mi-24 helicopter gunships in the air preserved the illusion of control, but in the mountains and in the night, the rebellion still burned.

The war was shifting to a new phase, a terrorist one. One rebel commander, Shamil Basayev, accompanied by 195 fighters, bribed and bluffed his way 110 kilometres into Russia and seized first the mayor’s office and police station and then a local hospital in the town of Budyonnovsk. There he took 1,800 hostages, mostly civilians and including some 150 children. Demanding that Moscow withdraw from Chechnya, eventually Basayev negotiated a deal directly with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that allowed him and his men safe passage back home. The government did not pull out of Chechnya, but its airy claims that it was on the verge of winning took a beating.

FSK director Sergei Stepashin and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin were forced to resign because of the mismanagement of the crisis, but this became the new model of war. The Chechens could not beat the federal forces on the battlefield but could determine the place, time and terms of any engagement. In December 1995, for example, 600 rebels under Salman Raduyev seized much of Gudermes, Chechnya’s second largest city. They held it against massed federal assaults for two weeks, then agreed a ceasefire that likewise allowed them to leave unhindered. Then, on 9 January 1996, Raduyev launched an attack on Kizlyar airbase in neighbouring Dagestan, and when federal forces responded, took the hospital and over a thousand hostages, which he again traded for safe passage (although this time the Russians broke their agreement, and attacked the rebels as they left, regardless of the 150 human shields they had retained). Terrorist warfare could not break the federal forces, but nor could the Russians find and destroy the rebels.

The stalemate would be broken, ironically, by a Russian intelligence success. Dudayev could be a charismatic leader, but he was no strategist. Three government assassination attempts against him had failed, but on 21 April 1996 he was speaking on a satellite phone when Russian electronic warfare officers in a specially modified A-50 ‘Mainstay’ surveillance aircraft were able to triangulate his location. Two Su-24 bombers were scrambled and hit his location, mortally wounding him. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, but real power devolved to Maskhadov. He knew something dramatic would be needed to force Moscow to negotiate seriously: not just a terrorist operation, but something to change the whole political calculus. He needed to take back Grozny.

The tempo of guerrilla attacks began to slacken, and Moscow allowed itself to believe that it was winning, that Dudayev’s death had somehow changed the game. At the end of May, Yeltsin visited Grozny and told the assembled troops that ‘the war is over, you have won’. To reflect this, conscript-heavy units were sent home, and the OGFV shrank from its peak of 55,000 to just over 41,000: 19,000 regular troops and 22,000 police and VV. Yeltsin also sacked Grachyov, whose reputation for corruption and incompetence had come to outweigh his political utility, as part of a pre-election deal with Alexander Lebed, the tough ex-paratrooper and Afghan War veteran, whom he wanted as his running mate. Grachyov was no great loss to the Defence Ministry, but it meant that at a crucial time, it was first headed by an interim, acting minister (Chief of the General Staff Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov) and then by a new minister, Gen. Igor Rodionov, in transition. It contributed to a lack of attention being paid to the situation on the ground. Instead, policy was being shaped by politics and Yeltsin’s need to tell the Russian people that the war was all but over. The plan was that by the end of the year, only a single VV brigade and the army’s 205th Motor Rifle Brigade would be left in Chechnya. Of the forces remaining, more were sent south in what was seen as a last push to take the remaining rebel strongholds.

Maskhadov had a plan of his own, though. On the night of 5/6 August, before the day Yeltsin was going to be inaugurated after his re-election to the presidency in a poll widely regarded as rigged, 1,500 rebels were quietly infiltrating Grozny in 25-man squads, easily bypassing the checkpoints and guard stations from which Russian troops rarely ventured after dark. At 0550 hours, they launched a surprise offensive, and within three hours, most of the city was in their hands. Federal forces were holding out in the centre and at Khankala airbase, but most of the 7,000 army and MVD garrison fled or hunkered down in their garrisons, around which the rebels hurriedly placed mines and firing positions.

Volunteers and reinforcements swelled Maskhadov’s forces to around 6,000 men over the coming days, but even so this was a stunning blow to the Russians. Desperate to retake it, Pulikovsky sent columns into the city piecemeal, and so they were defeated in detail. On 11 August, a battalion from the 276th Motor Rifle Regiment did manage to break through to the defenders still holding the centre but this did not change the reality on the ground, that the rebels were holding Grozny and blockading around 3,000–4,000 federal troops. Infuriated, on 19 August Pulikovsky demanded that the rebels surrender, and even before his ultimatum had expired, launched mass air and artillery bombardments. An already battered city began to be flattened further, and by 21 August, an estimated 220,000 people had fled Grozny, leaving no more than 70,000 civilians in a city which before the war had been home to 400,000.

Ultimately, there was no doubt that the federal forces could win militarily, but Maskhadov was rightly counting on the fact that all wars are ultimately political acts. The spectacle of the Russian army losing a city to rebels who had publicly been discounted as all but beaten, and their capacity also to steal Yeltsin’s day of glory, all led to a massive political backlash. Lebed, now the secretary of Yeltsin’s Security Council, had long been sceptical about the war. He flew to Chechnya and ordered Pulikovsky to stand his forces down. Yeltsin just wanted the problem to go away, and so he authorized Lebed to hold direct talks with Maskhadov.

On 30 August, the two veterans of the Red Army concluded the Khasavyurt Accord. It was hardly the basis for a lasting peace. It shelved the fundamental question of Chechnya’s constitutional status but instead recognized Chechen autonomy, while leaving all kinds of thorny issues as to its limits unresolved. In effect, so long as Chechnya pretended to be part of Russia, Moscow would not try to actually assert any control over it. It would prove no more than a temporary pause, and in 1999, war would return to Chechnya. As so often the case, a brilliant guerrilla commander does not always turn out to be so lucky or capable as a national leader and he would prove unable to prevent the slide into a second conflict. But for now, federal forces were withdrawn, the Chechens could start to rebuild their devastated country, and Yeltsin had one fewer pending crisis in his in-box: the First Chechen War was over.
