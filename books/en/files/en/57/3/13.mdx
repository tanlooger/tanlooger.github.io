title: 13 Shoigu, the Rebuilder
---



The Victory Day parade on 9 May has become one of the Putin regime’s holiest of holy days. It is not just the president who benefits from this carefully stage-managed pageant of triumphalism and military might, though. In 2015, as Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was being driven into Red Square under the Spasskaya – Saviour’s – Tower gateway, his car stopped and he deliberately crossed himself. This televised moment was a striking example of his political nous, at once aligning him with the Russian Orthodox Church and also the country’s history and traditions. Back in tsarist times, after all, it had been established practice to stop, bare-headed, and show reverence to the icon mounted above the gate. Even tsars would do so, and the legend was that when Napoleon arrogantly rode through the gate in 1812, after his armies had seized the city, a sudden wind blew his hat from his head.

Shoigu is one of the big beasts of the Russian political system, a savvy politician who, despite his origins in the distant Siberian region of Tyva, where the locals still largely practise a form of Buddhism, has won widespread and enthusiastic public support. At least before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, there was talk of his becoming presidential plenipotentiary to the Siberian Federal District – essentially viceroy of Siberia – but he was also talked about as a future prime minister or, very, very quietly, even president. In part, this was thanks to what appeared to be his capable continuation of the reform process and his capacity to win over even a sceptical and recalcitrant High Command after the Serdyukov era, even if now the question is how far this was just good PR.

Who is Sergei Shoigu?

Shoigu, after all, has demonstrated his skills at spin and a near-unique ability to rise within this carnivorous and competitive political system without making enemies and by being what in business terms would be a turnaround manager, taking dysfunctional institutions and making them work. Certainly the military needed all his talents after five and a half years of Serdyukov and the dramatic (and, for the generals, unpopular) reforms that had been pushed through after the Georgian War. This was nothing new to him, though. Born in 1955 to an ethnic Tyvan father and a Ukrainian-born Russian mother, Shoigu was an athletic and adventurous boy, whose passion for risky escapades including hopping ice floes across the Yenisei River earned him the nickname Shaitan (‘Satan’). He was also a good student, though, and graduated as a civil engineer. After a decade working in construction, he became a Communist Party organizer and then got his big break with an appointment in 1990 as deputy chief of the Russian State Architecture and Construction Committee. This meant a move to Moscow, and also responsibility for housing and other building projects at a time when budgets were tiny, the administration was in disarray and the state itself collapsing.

Nonetheless, Shoigu quickly acquired a reputation as a man who could keep his head in a crisis and do his best with what he had. This seemed to prove a mixed blessing when, in 1991, he was then tapped to head the Rescue Corps. The Corps was responsible for everything from search and rescue to civil defence, a grab-bag of agencies and duties characterized by infamous inefficiency, corruption and demoralization. It looked like a career dead-end, especially as it meant, in effect, that Shoigu became responsible for every disaster that befell the country. He made a virtue of a necessity, though. He reorganized the Corps, which became the Ministry for Emergency Situations (MChS: Ministerstvo po Chrezvychainym Situatsiyam) in 1994, streamlining the administration, bringing in tough audits to crack down on corruption, and introducing measures such as smart new uniforms to bring an unprecedented esprit de corps.

Meanwhile, Shoigu himself made a point of never shirking attending disasters, from the 1995 earthquake that devastated the oil town of Neftegorsk in Sakhalin, killing more than half its inhabitants, to the crash of 2001 Vladivostok Air Flight 352 while coming in to land at Irkutsk. Instead of becoming the avatar of misery, he became a reassuring presence, comforting the bereaved, coordinating relief operations and briefing the press. He knew how to play the behind-the-scenes bureaucratic games that had seen the Corps made a ministry – and thus, himself a minister – and in 2001 take the State Fire Service from the Interior Ministry. But he also demonstrated that he knew how to run an agency, and by the time he moved on in 2012, he had made the MChS one of the more efficient and even honest state agencies in Russia.

None of this escaped the Kremlin’s attention. In 1999, he was made a Hero of Russia, but more to the point, he was appointed point man for Unity, a new political party that was being built to, in effect, provide a power base for the soon-to-be-president Putin. Boris Yeltsin called him ‘our greatest star’.1 It was a naked attempt to cash in on his popularity, but he accepted it, and in 2001 Unity would merge with the Fatherland-All Russia movement to form United Russia, still the basis for Putin’s political order.

Nonetheless, Shoigu clearly wasn’t especially interested in electoral politics – and realized that there was room only for one ‘star’ in the firmament. Instead, he set out to build a relationship with Putin, giving the famously dog-loving president a black Labrador, Koni. It was said that Koni was Putin’s favourite dog; she also proved a psychological weapon: in 2007, he let her meet the equally famously dog-fearing German chancellor Angela Merkel, who had come for a summit. A keen and aggressive ice hockey player, Shoigu became a fixture on the president’s own ‘night games’ team and also took to inviting Putin on long holiday trips to his native Tyva. Even then, he clearly understood the politics of the situation, diplomatically fading into the background when Putin was being photographed fishing shirtless, hiking the tundra or otherwise demonstrating his macho credentials. In this way, Shoigu has become the only member of Putin’s real inner circle who is not an old colleague from KGB or Leningrad/St Petersburg days.

In 2012, he finally left the MChS (although he left it in the hands of a collection of his people), to stand for and win the position of governor of the crucial Moscow Region. Again, it is unclear whether this was Shoigu’s initiative or whether he was induced to take the job, but he quickly initiated new infrastructure projects, started to clear out dead wood and dismantled some corrupt circles that were skimming off state funds at a level unacceptable even by the standards of the time. However, after just six months, Putin needed a new defence minister who could continue the reform process but reconcile the High Command to it. It was once more time for Shoigu to step into the breach.

‘A Servant to the tsar, a Father to the Soldiers’

Appointed on 6 November 2012, he set to with a characteristic mix of charm offensive and administrative drive. On the one hand, he tried to signal to the generals that he was on their side. Whereas Serdyukov always wore a suit, Shoigu adopted a general’s uniform (he had a military-style rank from his time at MChS, so this was considered appropriate) as a symbolic gesture. He reversed some of the most resented yet also least consequential of the previous cuts, not least in the cohorts of Suvorovtsy and Nakhimovtsy, the teenage cadets who attended the Suvorov Military Schools and Nakhimov Naval Schools, respectively, cradles of the next generation officer corps. Where Serdyukov had often dwelt on the military’s failings in his public pronouncements, Shoigu talked them up, telling them of the bright future ahead.

Admittedly, Shoigu could afford to be conciliatory, as the most painful aspects of reform, notably the downsizing, had already been accomplished. He made it clear, though, that he did not propose to reverse the process. While the prestigious ‘palace guard’ Tamanskaya and Kantemirovskaya Divisions were restored, for example, the brigade structure remained the basic element of the army. Instead, he focused on taking the military establishment he had inherited and – as with the MChS – making it work.

The frequency, scale and realism of military exercises began to increase. A comprehensive study by Johan Norberg of the Swedish Defence Research Agency found that ‘before 2009, Russia handled armed conflicts and local wars. Military exercises since 2009 display an ambition and capabilities increasingly pertaining to regional wars’ – which according to Russian military typology could include a war with NATO.2 These were serious exercises, too, and the new units would be drilled in wargames that were not, as too many were in the older days, simply staged acts of theatrical competence meant to convey a reassuring message to the political leadership. Instead, they were serious challenges, backed up by snap inspections that could make or break an officer’s career. Meanwhile, Serdyukov’s efforts to use outsourcing and civilian contractors to improve soldiers’ living standards, providing everything from catering to cleaning, were retained and even expanded.

The humble sock became a symbol of a new mood of modernization and common sense. Until 2013, Russian soldiers – like their Soviet and even tsarist forebears – had worn not socks but rectangular cloths called portyanki that were wrapped around the foot. Serdyukov had promised to abolish them, but never got round to it. In January 2013, Shoigu was convening a video conference of senior staff across the country, itself an innovation, when he declared that ‘we must forget the word “portyanki” by the end of this year’.3 And they did. This may sound like a trivial move, but it was greatly appreciated by long-suffering Russian soldiers, proved that Shoigu could get things done, and demonstrated his concern for the ordinary grunt. It was both necessary and a brilliant bit of public relations, and I remember soldiers talking about how they would ceremonially burn their portyanki when their new issue socks arrived. No wonder people began saying of Shoigu, using a line by the 19th-century poet Mikhail Lermontov, that he was ‘A servant to the tsar, a father to the soldiers’.4



General Gerasimov

Chief of the General Staff Makarov was almost as unpopular in the High Command as Serdyukov. What Shoigu needed now was not so much a thinker as a foreman, a hard-driving top soldier able to whip this ‘New Look Army’ into shape, and so he quickly replaced him with Col. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, a man he rightly described as ‘a military man to the roots of his hair’.5 A former Suvorov cadet, Gerasimov had come from working-class beginnings. He was a tank officer, who had risen through the ranks first in the 90th Guards Tank Division in Warsaw Pact Poland, then in the 29th Motor Rifle Division in the Far Eastern VO, before rising to command the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division. He led the 58th Combined Arms Army 2001–03, while it was engaged in Chechnya, and later headed the Main Directorate of Combat Training – Makarov’s old post. After tours commanding both the Leningrad and then Moscow VOs, in 2010 he had become Deputy Chief of the General Staff, then commander of the newly created Central VO before returning to the General Staff as Shoigu’s right hand.

When formally accepting his new position from Putin, he said:

I believe that all the activities of the General Staff should be directed towards achieving one main goal – maintaining the combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces such as to guarantee that they can accomplish whatever tasks they are set. And I will do everything in my power to achieve this goal.6

He meant it. Gerasimov very much drove the campaign to get the newly reorganized forces combat-ready. The exercise cycle cranked up to levels unknown since Soviet times. With Russian ally Syria experiencing growing unrest, the Russians also began maintaining what was in effect a permanent naval task force in the eastern Mediterranean, largely drawn from rotations from the Black Sea Fleet. There were inevitable glitches and blunders, of course. During exercises held in the Central VO in February 2013, for example, coordination between units and ground and air forces continued to be a problem, and failings because of poor maintenance and old kit caused some embarrassing moments, especially when three Mi-24 helicopter gunships simply would not start, and at least two BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicles broke down in the first stage of movement. On the whole, though, the military began to demonstrate the kind of combat readiness which had long been the Kremlin’s goal, and even looked modern.

When the ‘little green men’ – special forces not wearing insignia – were fanning out across the Crimean peninsula in 2014, one detail of their kit assumed a disproportionate significance in much of the media coverage and subsequent online chatter: their kneepads. These are understatedly useful parts of the modern soldier’s uniform, but the point was that they had not hitherto been part of the Russians’ repertoire, and in many ways they were a metaphor for just how Western these invaders looked, from their digital camouflage and modern body armour to the equipment they carried, including earpiece tactical radios and personalized weapons. Putin’s suggestion, when asked if these were indeed Russian commandos, that they could simply have been shopping in army surplus stores, was deliberately tongue-in-cheek. This was the first serious outing for the new Ratnik (‘Warrior’) future infantry combat system, a combined suite of uniforms and personal equipment meant to take the country’s soldiers firmly into the 21st century.

Over time, the idea is to upgrade Ratnik but already an ambitious replacement is in the works. The basis of the futuristic Sotnik (‘Centurion’ for want of a better direct translation) outfit will be a lightweight suit of battle armour, tough enough to resist a heavy machine-gun bullet, yet with a coating that masks the soldier’s thermal signature and even has an ‘electrochromic’ chameleon camouflage that can change colour at the touch of a button. Micro-drones will stream video footage directly to the soldier, while a powered exoskeleton allows him or her to carry heavy loads and move at speed without tiring. All very ambitious, and to be honest Sotnik is likely to be a technology concept testing exercise rather than becoming the next standard issue in the next few years.7 Nonetheless, it is symbolic of Moscow’s desire – if probably not ability – to leapfrog into the status of a leading-edge military power.

Rearmament and Recruitment

Meanwhile, Shoigu was taking the lead in rearmament. Serdyukov had tried to crack down on waste, while also negotiating hard with the defence industries. After all, until around 2008, the amount of new, top of the line equipment being bought and fielded was negligible. Serdyukov had forced defence suppliers to increase their quality control and cut their profit margins. He even began to buy foreign systems, in part as a shot across their bows. In fairness, while some of the so-called ‘metal-eaters’ were complacent, others were frankly struggling to modernize, and so this hard-nosed approach not only made Serdyukov unpopular with the industrialists, but also ironically slowed procurement, as companies had to revamp their procedures.

In 2011, Serdyukov had complained to then-President Medvedev about the industry’s failings, blaming it for the incompletion of the 2010 State Defence Order and even arguing that the heads of some companies should be disciplined. (Again, this won him few friends.) Medvedev duly went on to criticize their conduct, grumbling that ‘it is an unacceptable situation when decisions are made at the highest level, the money is allocated, and yet the output is not delivered’.8 He even asked, ‘who has been punished for it and how?’ and, in a line that evoked the era of Gulag labour camps, added, ‘I am sure you realize that in different times half of you present here would already be engaged in hard physical labour in the fresh air’. This sounded like fighting talk, but a few months later, Medvedev announced that he was backing Putin for a return to the Kremlin, and promptly became a lame duck president. His capacity to force change on the powerful defence industrialists – several of whom had ties to Putin – went from limited to non-existent.

Shoigu characteristically mixed carrot and stick. He returned to the old policy of essentially buying kit only from Russian suppliers, except for some traditional exceptions (such as Ukrainian naval engines and particular items needed by the special forces) and adopted a more flexible approach to contract terms. While he had no qualms about calling out companies failing to meet their agreed standards, in the main, he made an alliance with the ‘metal-eaters’. Given that he had more money to spend, both thanks to the overall cuts in military manpower and the rising defence budget – in 2010, Putin had announced a 19.4 trillion ruble ($698.4 billion) weapons procurement plan for 2011–20 – he also could dangle sizeable orders as an incentive to get producers to clean up their act.

While only 16% of Russia’s equipment was considered ‘modern’, in 2010 a ten-year State Armament Programme had been adopted that wanted to bring this to 70% by 2020. Admittedly, the notion of ‘modern’ proved hazy, but essentially it meant either built in the last decade or recently and substantively upgraded. This meant a substantial and sustained procurement campaign, but that figure was reached.

Meanwhile, the armed forces had an establishment strength of a million, but in fact some 220,000 officers, 186,000 kontraktniki, and 296,000 conscripts, for a total force of just over 700,000, with almost as many officers as draftees. This was a problem, especially given the rapid churn of conscripts serving just 12-month national service terms and continued problems recruiting and retaining kontraktniki. Demographics was also an issue: the 1980s and 1990s had seen the birth-rate fall quite substantially, largely in response to the economic miseries of the time, and this was now working through into the size of the available conscript pool. In 2011, for example, the military had needed some 440,000 conscripts from the spring and autumn draft, but with deferments (largely on educational grounds), medical waivers (many of which were simply bought from corrupt doctors) and the shrinking overall pool, it was getting harder and harder to meet these targets. Since 2009, the voyenkomaty, the draft boards, had been having to accept conscripts with criminal records.

In response, Shoigu did what he could to make professional service more attractive, raising pay and improving conditions. In the interim, he reversed another of the Serdyukov/Makarov reforms. The Russian military used to have the rank of praporshchik, or warrant officer (michman in the navy), the kind of longer-service professional soldiers who might be sergeants in Western armies. In 2009, they began to be phased out, because the expectation was that they would be replaced by kontraktnik sergeants. In total, there had been around 142,000 of them, but most lacked the educational background to be promoted into the officer corps but quite understandably did not want to accept the cut in seniority and pay to become sergeants. Some 20,000 did become junior officers, but almost all the rest were lost to a military that was desperate for experienced volunteers. Shoigu promptly reversed this disastrous initiative, and began hiring back 55,000 former praporshchiki and michmany into the ranks.

Ready for Action

There would inevitably be more changes, not least as Russia’s relations with the West worsened. Brigades were all very well for flexible, mobile local wars, but the prospect of major conventional clashes would lead in 2013 to a partial return to divisions, as an altogether more hard-hitting structure able to conduct major mechanized operations, while all-professional battalion tactical groups generated by brigades became modular combat forces, tested out in Ukraine’s Donbas conflict. In 2014, the Northern Fleet was detached from Western VO to form the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command which, in 2021, became a fully fledged Northern Military District responsible for Russia’s Arctic flank. These will be discussed below, but in essence, Shoigu and Gerasimov completed the military machine that Serdyukov and Makarov had set out to build.

This was just as well for the Kremlin. Putin’s policies had become increasingly authoritarian and nationalist. Protests against the rigging of the 2011 parliamentary elections and then his return to power in 2012 were perceived as sponsored by the West. Then, a popular rising against the government in neighbouring Ukraine led to the 2014 annexation of Crimea and intervention in the Donbas, triggering Western criticism and sanctions. Facing diplomatic isolation and the potential fall of another of Moscow’s client regimes, in 2015, Russian forces deployed into Syria. Each of these conflicts not only exacerbated the worsening relations between Moscow and the West, but they also brought new challenges and new lessons, to which the military would adapt and respond. It also means that the Russian military has a wealth of military experience, hard-learned in a range of combat theatres.

In October 2014, as the new Cold War was brewing, Shoigu’s line was that ‘Russia’s sovereignty, which is secured by its army and navy, will always be the obstacle against which during the 1,152 years of Russia’s existence many Western rulers have broken their teeth.’9 If in 2000 Putin had inherited a country whose military was scarcely functional, in what was actually a strikingly short time Russia had acquired forces that should be capable of waging and winning a whole range of conflicts, from short, sharp interventions to a nasty counter-insurgency fought far from the country’s borders. In many ways this will make or break Putin’s dreams of a resurgent Russia, but it is also good for his defence minister. Shoigu is a politician, who has carefully curated his image and built alliances with all kinds of constituencies, from the ‘fighting generals’ with real wartime experience to the Russian Orthodox Church. He knows how to calibrate bombast, talking up Russia without seeming to thrust himself too far into the spotlight so as to risk looking like he is challenging the president. The irony is that the first of the wars of the new era, the one that helped solidify Shoigu’s reputation as Russia’s new guardian and military figurehead, is one he seems to have been lukewarm about launching: the 2014 seizure of Crimea.
