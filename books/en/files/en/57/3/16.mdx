title: 16 Lessons of the Donbas War
---



It was 2020, and I was sitting in on a briefing about Operation Orbital, Britain’s capacity-building mission in Ukraine. Since 2015, it had provided training in a whole range of basic military skills, from leadership and planning to bomb disposal and field medicine. This being a modern Western military there was, of course, an entirely superfluous PowerPoint presentation (though the Americans are still kings of the slide deck), with lots of facts, figures and nice maps. Afterwards, though, one of the presenters, an infantry captain, was keen to emphasize that it was not a one-way street: ‘Let’s be honest, we can also learn from the Ukrainians, too. No one else has the same experience in fighting a modern, peer rival in conventional war.’ He paused. ‘I’ve seen action in Iraq and Afghanistan; I’ve been under fire. But I’ve never faced a tank.’

For all the attention paid to so-called ‘grey zone’ or ‘hybrid’ operations in Ukraine – the cyber-attacks and electronic mischief-making, the propaganda and subversion, the economic and political pressure – the 2015–22 Donbas War was largely a conventional one, in which sniper attacks or artillery exchanges periodically gave way to open battles using the full panoply of modern warfare. No wonder that Western armies whose recent experience had largely been in dusty counter-insurgency wars against scattered irregulars, were eager to tap the Ukrainians’ experience. At the same time, it provided the Russians an opportunity to test theories and learn lessons in a conflict longer than the brief Georgian campaign and less specific than Syria.

After all, though the Russians never made quite such a dramatic shift to ‘small wars’ as the West, implicit within the ‘New Look’ reforms had been the notion that all conceivable future operations would be limited interventions in post-Soviet Eurasia. Their architect, Gen. Makarov, had been explicit, in a speech to the Academy of Military Sciences, saying that ‘it is important to understand that the combat zone is not far to the west or to the east, it is along the borders of the Russian Federation, in the CIS countries.’1 Such conflicts would put a premium on the speed with which force groupings could be mobilized, but not sheer mass. The war in the Donbas, though, and the consequent worsening of relations with the West, once again reminded the High Command and the Kremlin of the risk of larger conflicts. This led to the partial return of the division, for example. More broadly, the war demonstrated a number of specific Russian strengths and weaknesses.

Command and Control in a Proxy War is Hard

Alexander Mozgovoi was a native son of Lugansk who found his passion and his passing in the rebellion. Up until then, he had been a senior sergeant in the Ukrainian military and then a cook in St Petersburg, but he had returned home at the start of 2014, and when the rebellion began, discovered new talents as warlord. He formed a militia group called the Prizrak (‘Ghost’) Battalion, and although at first he nominally pledged allegiance to Strelkov, Mozgovoi kept Prizrak separate from the Army of the South-East and even LNR People’s Militia command structures. It acquired a reputation as brutal but effective, such that it even attracted volunteers from abroad, most of whom went into its largely Francophone Continental Unit, and Unit 404, a detachment of foreign Communist fighters also known as the Biryukov-Markov Unit.

It is fair to say that Mozgovoi, having finally become a ‘someone’, was not willing to share the limelight or bend the knee. He regularly clashed with other militia commanders, in at least one case even drawing a gun on one of his notional allies. He also took to considering himself a law unto himself. In October 2014, he even held a kangaroo court at which a suspect was executed for alleged rape on the basis of a show of hands from the audience. Just as Kyiv moved as quickly as it could to bind the volunteer units into its National Guard, by 2015 so too was Moscow trying to forge a more unified command structure within the 1st (Donetsk) and 2nd (Lugansk) Corps. Mozgovoi was unwilling to accept subordination, so at first the LNR authorities and the Russians tried to put pressure on him by limiting the supplies of food and ammunition sent to Prizrak. In response, he upped the ante, formally setting up his own political party, Narodnoye Vozrozhdeniye (National Renewal), by application to Kyiv.

Two weeks later, on 23 May 2015, Mozgovoi was returning to his base of operations at Alchevsk after a meeting in Lugansk. He was accompanied by his press spokeswoman and six bodyguards, travelling in three cars. The bodyguards were heavily armed, as there had been an attempt on his life a couple of months before. They didn’t have a chance to use them, though. Six Russian-built MON-50 directional mines had been secreted along a stretch of the road outside the village of Mykhailivka, linked together by command wire. As Mozgovoi’s motorcade passed them, unseen ambushers detonated the mines, each of which blasted 540 steel balls towards their target. Mozgovoi, his driver and two bodyguards were killed instantly. The attackers then raked the cars with AKM assault rifles and RPK machine guns, finishing off the rest, before disappearing into the night.

The LNR authorities immediately blamed the attack on Ukrainian special forces, as did the new commander of Prizrak, but Mozgovoi’s closest allies claimed that he was assassinated by Russian Spetsnaz. After all, while Kyiv would shed few tears for Mozgovoi, there is little evidence that it had the kind of ninjas who could infiltrate rebel-held areas, carry out such a precise assassination (which required knowledge of his movements) and exfiltrate, all without leaving a trace. Besides, there had been something of a pattern of misfortunes facing militia commanders who found themselves in opposition either to the local leaderships or to Moscow. As well as Mozgovoi, controversial commanders Alexander ‘Batman’ Bednov and Pavel ‘Batya’ Dremov met their ends in 2015, and in 2016, ‘Motorola’ Pavlov met the same fate. In most cases, they were killed by bombs, booby traps or ambushes. Most shocking was the murder of Alexander Zakharchenko, who headed the DNR from August 2014 until his death in August 2018.

While the official line is always that they were killed by Kyiv’s agents, in not a single case was any evidence in support of this found. Instead, suspicion has fallen on Russian special forces or mercenaries from the Wagner Group (see Chapters 18 and 26) or, in a few cases, organized crime rivals, such as the figures behind the gunning down of Yevgeny Zhilin, commander of the Oplot Brigade, in a Moscow restaurant in 2016. In 2016, former LNR prime minister Gennady Tsyplakov seemingly hanged himself in prison after being accused of trying to stage a coup against Igor Plotnitsky, at the time head of the LNR.

In essence, Moscow has had to accept that irregular proxy forces may be relatively cheap but that you get what you pay for: while they may be individually brave and sometimes effective on the battlefield, much of the time they are thuggish opportunists who are unimpressive in battle and undisciplined off it. As discussed in Chapter 26, the best way of understanding modern Russian thinking on operations below the threshold of full-scale war is not as ‘grey zone’ or ‘hybrid’, but ‘political war’, the use of every means at a state’s disposal, overt and covert, short of direct warfare to accomplish its political ends. This certainly seems to have been the Kremlin’s approach in the early, more confused phase of the Donbas conflict, until it became clear that a random collection of thugs, nationalists, opportunists, Cossacks and idealists could not stand against the government forces, and Moscow had to step up or step out.

Without formal means of enforcing discipline and removing commanders, the Russians turned to bloodily informal ones. At first, they tried setting up their own militia groups such as the Vostok Battalion, and then using the Wagner Group mercenaries. They also tried to control more powerful systems. When Moscow reluctantly sent six TOS-1 Solntsepyok thermobaric launchers to the DNR, for example, it ensured not just that the crews were its own people, but that it had to grant authorization to release the rockets for use. By 2019, though, while the majority of the soldiers in the 1st and 2nd Corps were locals, supported by a smattering of Cossacks and other Russian volunteers, the higher command structure was overwhelmingly made up of regular Russian officers assigned to their positions, even if hiding behind fake names or callsigns. According to Kyiv, for example, Col. Gen. Andrei Serdyukov, who went on to command the VDV paratrooper corps, was in 2015 in overall control of operations in the Donbas, with the callsign ‘Sedov’. They are backed and commanded through the conventional military hierarchy. The 8th Guards Army, which was reformed in 2017, is based south of Rostov-on-Don, at Novorossiisk. Although the 20th Guards Army at Voronezh to the north certainly also played a role, the 8th appears to have been made the operational hub for deployments into the Donbas , even as it posed the main conventional threat to Ukraine.

Information Warfare is a Powerful Force Multiplier

On the other hand, the Russians have a keen awareness of how political operations can support kinetic action and how information and communications systems are not only crucial force multipliers of the future, but they are also battlegrounds. Avdiivka is an industrial city on the northern approaches to Donetsk, which had first been captured by rebels, then retaken by government forces in July 2014. Promzona, the so-called ‘Industrial Zone’ in the east of the city, had been delineated as a neutral zone because of its proximity to the M04 highway out of Donetsk, but in March 2016, government forces began establishing positions there, posing an implied threat to the route. Sporadic local clashes continued through the year, but in January 2017 they escalated to full-scale combat. Each side accused the other of having initiated hostilities, but the actual trigger seems to have been the government’s decision to build up a position called Almaz-2 which could cut the road.

In response, the rebels began shelling the city, creating a humanitarian crisis as its remaining 17,000 or so inhabitants found themselves with no or limited heat or power in the height of winter. Over the next few days, rebel forces launched repeated offensives against Avdiivka’s defenders, largely troops from the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, but despite several times being able to break through their lines, they were never able to concentrate enough forces to exploit these local successes. This was despite a serious attack from the rebel-held village of Spartak just south of Avdiivka, in which an armoured column looped round the city limits to engage from the north-west, trying to take the strategically important Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant. By 4 February, though, the fighting was starting to die down, as a local ceasefire was agreed, and the next day, heat and electricity supplies were restored to the long-suffering residents.

This was some of the most bitter fighting since 2014–15, and demonstrated just how far the Ukrainian army had come in rebuilding its fighting form. One of the striking innovations of this particular battle, though, was that in the midst of battle, Ukrainian soldiers’ mobile phones began pinging with a series of disconcerting text messages. ‘Nobody needs your kids to become orphans.’ ‘Your body will be found when the snow melts.’ ‘You’re just meat to your commanders.’ Some even seemed to come from the numbers of neighbouring soldiers’ phones.

Such fake messages had been encountered before in the war, but never in such density and with so many appearing to be sent by soldiers’ comrades. It seems to have been thanks to a Russian RB-341V Leer-3 electronic warfare system, a truck-based piece of advanced technology that can deploy a cell site simulator on a drone. Lofted near the battlefield, it can hijack up to 6,000 phone connections at once over a 6-kilometre-wide area. Whereas in other situations it was used to locate mobile phones so that the Russians could direct artillery fire accurately on Ukrainian positions, in Avdiivka, it was used to try to demoralize them, and since then, the information operations deployed have become more advanced and imaginative.

Implausible Deniability has its Place

When MH17 was shot down over the Donbas in 2014, Moscow’s narrative control machine went into overdrive. Crash investigators were sent to the area to police the wreckage as far as they could, removing evidence of a Russian-built missile, while its overt and covert media outlets began spinning alternative explanations for the crash of varying degrees of implausibility. These ranged from that it was shot down by a Ukrainian Su-25, even though this is actually a ground-attack aircraft, to, most extraordinarily, that the people on the plane were already dead, part of an elaborate provocation staged by the CIA to blacken Russia’s reputation.

Beyond that, despite the reams of reports on Russian men and materiel in the Donbas, open source investigations geolocating images to specific locations there, even the incautious selfies Russian soldiers posted on their social media pages with street signs and landmarks in the background, Moscow claimed to have no direct role in the war. In part, this was to wrong-foot and bamboozle the West. However, while there are some who would still believe Putin over their own press and leaders, in the main this is a narrative that has long since lost any credence. Even back in 2015, when Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov tried to spin the official line in front of an audience of officials and experts at the Munich Security Conference, he was met with derisive laughter. In the main, the continued deception, just like the dependence on proxies and mercenaries, reflected rather the Kremlin’s attempt to conceal the true nature and scale of the war from its own people.

A substantial proportion of Russia’s soldiers are conscripts, which posed some particular political and operational challenges for Moscow. By law, conscripts may not serve in military operations abroad, except when war has formally been declared, unless they volunteer. Even if they do choose to do so, they are serving just 12 months in service, and after their basic and unit training, they are typically only considered truly useful for three or at most four months of their term. Furthermore, there was – rightly – considerable discomfort in the Kremlin about the potential backlash from ordinary Russians, if conscripts began to die in a war that officially wasn’t being fought. Hence the use of battalion tactical groups which could be assembled from kontraktniki in one or more brigades, a practice which may have become standard for projecting force but which to a considerable degree started as an expedient in the Donbas. This was not without significant cost. To generate the estimated 42,000 troops rotated through or near the Donbas in 2014, for example, meant drawing on some 117 combat and combat-support units.

The war also, though, consolidated a Russian commitment to ensuring that it control the narratives around any wars it fights as far as it can. It failed to do so in the First Chechen War and paid the price, so made sure that it could present the 2008 Georgian War purely as a response to Tbilisi’s ‘aggression’. However, the Donbas was the first long-term foreign war it tried to manage in this way.

Drones are the next Big Thing

On 11 July 2014, two Ukrainian mechanized brigades, the 24th and 72nd, along with a battalion of the 79th Airmobile Brigade and Border Troops, mustered outside the town of Zenopillya in southern Lugansk region, prior to launching an attack on rebel forces to their north. What they did not know, though, was that the Russians had tracked their movements by satellite and electronic means, and had massed artillery at Rovenky on their own side of the border – but just 15 kilometres away. Shortly after 0400 hours, two Russian Orlan-10 drones buzzed the government positions, sending back detailed targeting information, and the Ukrainians’ communications began to be jammed. Russian 122mm Tornado-G rocket systems (rather more advanced than the dated BM-21s issued to the rebels) started firing well-aimed salvos, 40 in all, that in a matter of minutes had turned the encampment into an inferno of shrapnel and fire. Thirty-seven soldiers were killed, over a hundred wounded, and trucks and armoured vehicles, including T-64 tanks, were left burnt-out across the field. The 1st Battalion of the elite 79th Brigade was so badly mauled that it had to be reconstituted, and both the 24th and 72nd were soon pulled out of the line, considered no longer combat-ready. Even in the age of ‘hybrid war’, artillery remains the last argument of kings. It was a case study in the power of concentrated firepower, when accurately targeted – and also the use of drones to allow that targeting.

Their use of drones was been particularly noteworthy in the Donbas, as the Russians made strides to catch up with Western practice. As well as the Orlan (‘Eagle’), they used the Granat-1 and -2, the Forpost, the Eleron 3SV, the Zastava and the hand-launched ZALA-421–08 for observation and fire control. This helped make up for the Russians’ decision not to use their considerable superiority in airpower, both to preserve a modicum of deniability but also because it was certain that they would suffer losses in the process.

As well as using drones, the Russians also appreciated the need to combat them. Ukraine had relatively few, but the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which tried, often vainly, to monitor breaches of the Minsk Accords and the many short-term ceasefires, found the quadcopter drones it used shot down, or rendered useless by jamming: by April 2021, more than half of its flights were experiencing signal interference. Ukraine’s drones faced the same problems. Russia’s R-330Zh Zhitel system can jam the GPS satellite navigation many rely on, while some reports have suggested they have trialled the Pishchal handheld jamming ‘rifle’ there, too.

There was no quick end to the War

In 2017, Ukrainian Chief of the General Staff Gen. Viktor Muzhenko suggested he could retake the Donbas in as little as ten days – albeit at the cost of 3,000 military dead and another 7,000–9,000 wounded, along with more than 10,000 civilian deaths.2 Whether or not he was advocating this – and, as will be discussed later, even then there were those in Kyiv who did talk of reconquering the Donbas by force some day – Moscow retained escalation dominance. There were too many ways they could surge more forces into the region or strike against Ukraine from other directions.

In order to try to make the best of this stalemate, in 2017–18, the Ukrainians adopted tactics based on making small, incremental advances into the ‘grey zone’ of no-man’s land along the line of contact, to occupy more defensible positions or ones with better fields of view, and in the process nudge the effective border forward. They could hardly have ‘salami sliced’ their way to victory, but it demonstrated that they were still committed to restoring their control over the contested regions, eventually.

After all, rather than inducing Kyiv to capitulate, the intervention into the Donbas generated an unprecedented sense of national identity: when Cyborgs: Heroes Never Die, a film about the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport, was released in 2017, it immediately became a local blockbuster. Meanwhile, Moscow was having to subsidize the unrecognized pseudo-states of the Donbas as well as defend them, in a conflict that was neither acknowledged nor at all popular at home.

This was a human tragedy. As of the end of 2021, its toll was estimated at more than 14,000 dead, and nearly 2 million internally displaced.3 The urbanized and industrialized Donbas region once held nearly 15% of Ukraine’s population and generated an equal share of its gross domestic product, but the economies of the DNR and LNR had all but collapsed. According to Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, it was costing Moscow $3 billion a year to subsidize them, at least as much as its military operations. Even those parts of the region not controlled by the rebels suffered from economic dislocation thanks to a 420-kilometre-long front line cut through it and the presence of populations of refugees. Kyiv was able to leverage its status as a victim of Russian aggression to win more support from the West, but nonetheless had to spend heavily on national defence: 5.95% of GDP in 2022. The aim was to make Ukraine a tough enough enemy not lightly to be challenged. Perhaps that prospect was looking too real to Putin, though. In 2021, Russia began massing unprecedented forces around Ukraine, and after almost a year of escalating rhetoric, these were unleashed on Ukraine, in the all-out war that had been looming for almost eight years.
