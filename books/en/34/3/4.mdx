title: FOUR
---



walking away from the hiss and whine of a Sixth Avenue bus, three or four days later, Frank Wheeler moved with a jaunty resignation toward Maureen Grube’s street. He didn’t especially feel like seeing her tonight, and this, he knew, was as it should be. The purpose of this visit was to break the thing off, and any impulsive eagerness for the sight of her would have been disconcerting. It always surprised and pleased him when his mood coincided with the nature of the thing he had to do, and this rare state had lately become almost habitual. He had been able, for instance, to wrap up all the rest of his Speaking-of series in little more than a day’s work apiece. Speaking of Sales Analysis, Speaking of Cost Accounting, and Speaking of Payroll—all now lay safely finished along with Production and Inventory Control, in a handsome cardboard folder on Bart Pollock’s desk.

“Well, Frank, these are fine,” Pollock had said yesterday, riffling the folder with his thumb. “And fortunately, I’ve got some good news for you this morning.” The good news, which Frank was able to receive with perfect composure, was that plans for Pollock’s project had now been “final-ized.” There would be an “informal shakedown conference” next Monday, at which Frank would join his new colleagues in helping to “block out a few objectives,” and after which he could consider himself no longer a member of Bandy’s staff. Meanwhile, it was now “time for the two of us to get together here on the matter of salary.” No nervous sweat broke out inside Frank’s shirt as they got together on it, and no ludicrous ghost of Earl Wheeler hung over the proceedings. His eyes never strayed in dismal aesthetic searching among Pollock’s office fixtures, nor was he plagued with cautionary thoughts of what April might say.

It was strictly business. He was richer by three thousand a year after shaking Pollock’s thick hand that morning—a sound, satisfactory amount that would provide, among other things, a comfortable fund against which to draw for the costs of obstetrics and psychoanalysis.

“Good,” April said on hearing the figure. “That’s about what you expected, isn’t it?”

“Just about, yes. Anyway, it’s nice to have the thing settled.”

“Yes. I imagine it must be.”

And now, having so competently arranged his business affairs, he could give his full attention to personal matters—which did, at the moment, need considerable straightening out. For the past two nights, or three, his marriage had taken that technical turn for the worse which, in the old days, would have filled him with anguish: April had begun to sleep in the living room again. But these, thank God, were not the old days. This time it hadn’t come about as the result of a fight, for one thing, and it wasn’t accompanied by any apparent rancor on her part.



“I haven’t been sleeping at all well,” she had announced the first night, “and I think I’d be more comfortable alone.”

“Okay.” He had assumed, though, that it was an arrangement for that night only, and he was nettled the following evening, when she again came trudging from the linen closet with an armload of bedclothes and began making the sofa into a bed.

“What’s the deal?” he asked mildly, leaning against the kitchen doorjamb with a drink in his hand while she flapped and spread the sheets. “You sore at me, or what?”

“No. Of course I’m not ‘sore’ at you.”

“You planning to go on doing this indefinitely, or what?”

“I don’t know. I’m sorry if it upsets you.”

He took his time in replying, first lazily dunking the ice cubes in his glass with a forefinger, then licking the finger, then moving away from the door with a luxuriantly tired shrug. “No,” he said. “It doesn’t upset me. I’m sorry you’re not sleeping well.”

And that, of course, was the other, the really important difference: it didn’t upset him. It annoyed him slightly, but it didn’t upset him. Why should it? It was her problem.

What boundless reaches of good health, what a wealth of peace there was in this new-found ability to sort out and identify the facts of their separate personalities—this is my problem, that’s your problem. The pressures of the past few months had brought them each through a kind of crisis; he could see that now. This was their time of convalescence, during which a certain remoteness from each other’s concerns was certainly natural enough, and probably a good sign. He knew, sympathetically, that in her case the adjustment must be especially hard; if it caused her periods of moodiness and insomnia, that was perfectly understand-able. In any case, the time was now at hand when he could, in the only mature sense, be of help to her. Next week, or as soon as possible, he would take whatever steps were necessary in lining up a reputable analyst; and he could already foresee his preliminary discussions with the man, whom he pictured as owlish and slow-spoken, possibly Viennese (“I think your own evaluation of the difficulty is essentially correct, Mr. Wheeler. We can’t as yet predict how extensive a course of therapy will be indicated, but I can assure you of this: with your continued cooperation and understanding, there is every reason to hope for rapid . . .”).

In the meantime, the main task before him was to put an end to the business with Maureen. He would much rather have been able to do it in a bar or a coffee shop uptown; that was what he’d had in mind this morning, when he’d cornered her in an alcove of the central file to make this date, but, “No, come to my place,” she had whispered over the spread folder they were using as camouflage. “Norma’s leaving early, and I’ll fix supper for us.”

“No, really,” he said. “I’d rather not. The thing is—” He would have said, “The thing is I want to have a talk with you,” but her eyes frightened him. What if she should begin to cry or something, right here in the office? Instead he said, “I don’t want you to go to any trouble,” which was true too; but in the end he had agreed.

The scene of the talk probably didn’t matter; the important thing was the talk itself, and the only really important thing about that was to make it definite and final. There was, he assured himself for the hundredth time, nothing to be apologetic about. It depressed him to consider how much energy he had wasted, over the years, in the self-denying posture of apology. From now on, whatever else his life might hold, there would be no more apologies.

“Excuse me,” called a woman’s voice from the curb.



“You’re Mr. Frank Wheeler, aren’t you?” She was coming toward him across the sidewalk, carrying a small suitcase, and he knew at once who she was from the predatory quality of her smile. She had caught him with his foot on the first of the pink stone steps of Maureen’s building.

“I’m Norma Townsend, Maureen’s roommate. I wonder if I could have a word with you.”

“Sure.” He didn’t budge. “What can I do for you?”

“Please.” She tilted her head slightly to one side as if to reprove a sullen child. “Not here.” And she moved past him toward an arty little espresso lounge two doors away. There was nothing to do but follow her, but he atoned for his meekness by staring critically at her tense, quivering buttocks. She was solid and duck-footed, wearing a modishly tubular dress, a “sheath,” in defiance of the fact that it emphasized her breadth and muscularity, and she trailed a perfume that had probably been described as Dark and Exciting in its point-of-sale display at Lord and Taylor’s.

“I won’t keep you a minute,” she said when she had him cornered at a small marble-topped table, when she’d arranged the suitcase at her feet, ordered a sweet vermouth, and put her hands through the series of clicking, snapping and organizing motions required in the job of removing a pack of cigarettes from her complicated handbag. “I’ve just time for an apéritif, and then I must run. I’m off to the Cape for two weeks. Maureen was coming with me, but she’s changed her plans. She now intends to spend her entire vacation here, as I expect you know. I didn’t know until last night, which I’m afraid does put me in a rather awkward position with the friends we were to visit. Are you sure you won’t have a drink?”

“No thanks.” He had to admit, watching her, that she wasn’t unattractive. If she could loosen her hair instead of skinning it back, if she could take off a little weight through the cheeks . . . but then he decided she would have to do more than that. She would have to learn not to move her eyebrows so much when she talked, and she would certainly have to get over saying things like “I’ve just time for an apéritif ” and “I’m off to the Cape.”

“I happen to be very annoyed with Maureen at the moment,” she was saying. “This vacation mix-up is only the latest in a long line of foolishness, but that’s beside the point. The main thing—” and here she looked at him keenly—“the important thing, is that I’m very deeply concerned about her too. I’ve known her a good deal longer and I believe I know her better than you do, Mr. Wheeler.

She’s a very young, very insecure, very sweet kid, and she’s gone through a lot of hell in the past few years. Right now she needs guidance and she needs friendship. On the face of it—and I hope you’ll forgive my speaking plainly—on the face of it, the one thing she definitely does not need is to get involved in a pointless affair with a married man. Mind you, I’m not—please don’t interrupt. I’m not interested in moralizing. I’d much rather feel that you and I can discuss this thing as civilized adults. But I’m afraid I must begin with an awkward question. Maureen appears to be under the impression that you’re in love with her. Is this true?”

The answer was so classically simple that the framing of it filled him with pleasure. “I’m afraid I don’t think that’s any of your business.”

She leaned back and smiled at him in a canny, speculative way, letting little curls of smoke dribble out of her nostrils, picking a flake of cigarette paper from her lip with the lac-quered nails of little-finger and thumb. He was reminded of Bart Pollock at lunch saying, “Let me see how good a judge of character I am,” and he wanted to reach across the table and strangle her.

“I think I like you, Frank,” she said at last. “May I call you that? I think I even like your getting angry; it shows integrity.” She came forward again, took a coquettish sip of her drink, and propped one elbow on the table. “Oh, look, Frank,” she said. “Let’s try to understand each other. I think you’re probably a very good, serious boy with a nice wife and a couple of nice kids out there in Connecticut, and I think possibly all that’s happened here is that you’ve gone and gotten yourself involved in a very human, very under-standable situation. Doesn’t that about sum it up?”

“No,” he said. “It doesn’t even come close. Now I’ll try, okay?”

“Okay.”

“Okay. I think you’re probably a meddling, tiresome woman, possibly a latent lesbian, and very definitely”—he laid a dollar bill on the table—“very definitely a pain in the ass. Have a nice vacation.”

And in four headlong strides, one of which nearly sent an effeminate waiter sprawling with a tray of demi-tasse cups, he was out of the place. All the way up the pink stone steps he felt he couldn’t contain the giant sobs of laughter that heaved in his chest—the look on her face!—but in the vestibule, where he leaned against a row of polished brass mailboxes to let it all come out of him, he found that instead of guffaws he was capable only of a self-stifling, whimpering giggle that came in uncontrollable spasms, using only the top part of his lungs and making his diaphragm ache. He couldn’t breathe.

When it was over, or nearly over, he crept back to the front door, pushed aside the dusty net curtain that covered its glass and peered down, just in time for a rear view of Norma out on the curb, wagging her handbag for a taxi. Her back was stiff with anger and there was something extremely pathetic about her suitcase, which looked expensive and brand-new. She had probably spent days buying it and weeks shopping for the things that would ride in its silken depths today—new bathing suits, slacks, sun lotion, a new camera—all the fussy, careful apparatus of a girlish good time. With the odd whimpering sounds still bubbling up from his rib cage he felt an incongruous wave of tenderness go out to her, as she climbed into the cab and rolled away.

He was sorry. But he would have to pull himself together now; it was time to deal with Maureen. He took several deep breaths and pressed the bell, and when the answering buzzer let him into the hallway he was careful not to take the stairs too fast. He didn’t want to be short of breath when he got there; everything depended on his being calm.

The door was on the latch. He knocked once or twice and then heard her voice, apparently coming from the bedroom. “Frank? Is that you? Come on in. I’ll be right out.”

The apartment was scrupulously clean, as if in readiness for a party, and a faint scent of simmering meat came from the kitchenette. Only now, strolling around the carpet, did he notice that a phonograph was playing the music he was dimly aware of having heard all the way upstairs, a smooth Viennese waltz done with many violins, the kind of thing known as cocktail music.

“There’s some drinks and stuff on the coffee table,”

Maureen’s voice called. “Help yourself.”

He did, gratefully making a stiff one, and tried to relax by sitting well back in the deep sofa.

“Did you close the door?” she called. “And lock it?”

“I think so, yes. What’s all the—”

“And are you sure you’re alone?”



“Sure I’m sure. What’s all the mystery about?”

She threw open the bedroom door and stood smiling there on tiptoe, nude. Then she began an undulant dance around the room, in waltz time, waving and rippling her wrists like an amateur ballerina, blushing and trying mightily not to giggle as she whirled for him to the soaring strings. He barely managed to put his drink on the table, spilling part of it, before she came falling heavily into his arms and knocked the wind out of him. She was drenched in the same perfume as Norma’s, and when she enveloped his head in a welcoming kiss he saw, at startlingly close range, that she was wearing even more eye make-up than usual. Each of her lashes was as thick and ragged as a spi-der’s leg on her cheek. Released from her mouth at last, he tried to ease himself into a more upright sitting position, to shift her weight off his belly, but it wasn’t easy because her arms were still locked around his neck, and in the effort his coat and shirt were dragged painfully tight across his back and chest. Finally he was able to free one hand to tear open his choking collar, and he tried to smile.

“Hello,” she murmured huskily, and kissed him again, filling his mouth with her tongue.

This time there was the desperation of a drowning man in his upward struggle; when he’d made it, she drew back and looked at him in dismay, her breasts wagging like little startled faces. He couldn’t speak for a minute until he’d regained his breath; then instead of looking at her he gazed down at his own hands, which were clasping the heavy sprawl of her thighs across his lap. He released his grip, spread his fingers and lightly tapped the upper thigh, as if it were the edge of a conference table.

“Look, Maureen,” he said. “I think we ought to have a talk.”



What happened after that, even while it was happening, was less like reality than a dream. Only a part of his consciousness was involved; the rest of him was a detached observer of the scene, embarrassed and helpless but relatively confident that he would soon wake up. The way her face clouded over when he began to talk, the way she sprang off his lap and fled for her dressing gown, which she clutched around her throat as tightly as a raincoat in a downpour as she paced the carpet—“Well; in that case there really isn’t anything more to say, is there? There really wasn’t any point in your coming over today, was there?”—these seemed to exist as rankling memories even before they were events: so did the way he followed her around the room, abjectly twisting one hand in the other as he apologized and apologized.

“Maureen, look; try to be reasonable about this. If I’ve ever given you cause to believe that I—that we—that I’m not happily married or anything, well, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

“And what about me? How am I supposed to feel? Have you thought about what kind of position this puts me in?”

“I’m sorry. I—”

And this was the final vignette: Maureen hunched in the belching black smoke of the kitchenette while her veal scal-lopini burned to a crisp.

“It’s not too bad, Maureen. I mean we can still eat it, if you like.”

“No. It’s ruined. Everything’s ruined. You’d better go now.”

“Oh, look. There’s no reason why we have to be—”

“I said please go. ”

No amount of drink in the Grand Central bars was able to blur those images, and all the way home, hungry and drunk and exhausted on the train, he sat with round, implor-ing eyes and moving lips, still trying to reason with her.

His dread of seeing her in the office the next day was so intense that he was in the act of stepping off the elevator before he remembered that she wouldn’t be there. She was on vacation. Would she follow Norma to the Cape? No; more likely she would use her two weeks to look for another job; in either case he could be fairly certain he would never see her again. And his relief on realizing this soon turned, perversely, into a worried kind of dismay. If he never saw her again, how would he ever have a chance to—well, to explain things to her? To tell her, in a level, unapologetic voice, all the level, unapologetic things he had to say?

Anxious thoughts of Maureen (Should he call her up?

Should he write her a letter?) still preoccupied him on Saturday, while he labored at his stone path in the dizzying heat or invented little errands that would take him away from home, allowing him to cruise aimlessly down back roads in his station car, mumbling to himself. It wasn’t until early Sunday afternoon, when he’d gone out in the station car to get the papers and ended up driving for miles, that the words “Forget it” rose to his lips.

It was a beautiful day. He was driving over the sunny crest of a long hill, past a thicket of elms whose leaves were just beginning to turn, when he suddenly began to laugh and to pound the old cracked plastic of the steering wheel with his fist. Forget it! What the hell was the point of thinking about it? The whole episode could now be dismissed as something separate and distinct from the main narrative flow of his life—something brief and minor and essentially comic. Norma humping out to the curb with her suitcase, Maureen leaping naked from his lap, himself padding after her through the smoke of the burning meat, wringing his hands—all now seemed as foolish as the distorted figures in an animated cartoon at the moment when the bouncing, tinny music swells up and the big circle begins to close in from all sides, rapidly enclosing the action within a smaller and smaller ring, swallowing it up until it’s nothing more than a point of jiggling light that blinks out altogether as the legend “That’s All, Folks!” comes sprawling happily out across the screen.

He stopped the car on the side of the road until his laughter had subsided; then, feeling much better, he made a U-turn and headed for home. Forget it! On the way back to Revolutionary Road he allowed his mind to dwell only on good things: the beauty of the day, the finished job of work on Pollock’s desk, the three thousand a year, even the

“shakedown conference” that was scheduled for tomorrow morning. It hadn’t been such a bad summer after all. Now, rolling home, he could look forward to the refreshment of taking a shower and getting into clean clothes; then he would sip sherry (his lips puckered pleasurably at the thought of it) and drowse over the Times for the rest of the afternoon. And tonight, if everything went well, would be the perfect time for a rational, common-sense discussion with April about this annoying business of the sofa. Whatever was bothering her could be fixed, could probably have been fixed days ago, if he’d taken the trouble to sit down with her and talk things out.

“Look,” he would begin. “This has been kind of a crazy summer, and I know we’ve both been under a strain. I know you’re feeling sort of lonely and confused just now; I know things look pretty bleak, and believe me I—”

The house looked very neat and white as it emerged through the green and yellow leaves; it wasn’t such a bad house after all. It looked, as John Givings had once said, like a place where people lived—a place where the difficult, intricate process of living could sometimes give rise to incredible harmonies of happiness and sometimes to near-tragic disorder, as well as to ludicrous minor interludes (“That’s All, Folks!”); a place where it was possible for whole summers to be kind of crazy, where it was possible to feel lonely and confused in many ways and for things to look pretty bleak from time to time, but where everything, in the final analysis, was going to be all right.

April was working in the kitchen, where the radio was blaring.

“Wow,” he said, laying the heavy Sunday papers on the table. “Is this ever a beautiful day.”

“Yes; it’s lovely.”

He took a long, voluptuously warm shower and spent a long time brushing and combing his hair. In the bedroom, he inspected three shirts before deciding on the one he would wear with his tight, clean khakis—an expensive cotton flannel in a dark green-and-black plaid—and he tried several ways of wearing it before he settled on folding its cuffs back twice, turning its collar up in back and leaving it unbuttoned halfway down his chest. Crouching at the mirror of April’s dressing table, he used her hand mirror to check the way the collar looked from the side and to test the effect, in profile, of his tightening jaw muscle.

Back in the kitchen, looking over the papers and loosely snapping his fingers in time to the jazz on the radio, he had to glance at April twice before he realized what was different about her: she was wearing one of her old maternity dresses.

“That looks nice,” he said.

“Thank you.”



“Is there any sherry?”

“I don’t think so, no. I think we’ve used it up.”

“Damn. Guess there isn’t any beer either, is there.” He considered having whiskey instead, but it was too early in the day.

“I’ve made some iced tea, if you’d like that. It’s in the ice-box.”

“Okay.” And he poured himself a glass without really wanting it. “Where are the kids, anyway?”

“Over at the Campbells’.”

“Oh; too bad. I thought I’d read them the funnies.”

He continued to finger through the papers for a few minutes, while she worked at the sink; then, because there was nothing else to do, he moved up close behind her and took hold of her arm, which caused her to stiffen.

“Look,” he began. “This has been kind of a crazy summer, and I know you’re—I know we’ve both been under a strain. I mean I know you’re—”

“You know I’m not sleeping with you and you want to know why,” she said, pulling away from his hand. “Well, I’m sorry, Frank, I don’t feel like talking about it.”

He hesitated, and then, to establish a better mood for communication, he kissed the back of her head with rever-ence. “Okay,” he said. “What do you feel like talking about, then?”

She had finished with the dishes and let the water out of the sink; now she was rinsing the dishrag, and she didn’t speak again until she had wrung it out, hung it on its hook, and moved away from the sink to turn and look at him, for the first time. She looked frightened. “Would it be all right if we sort of didn’t talk about anything?” she asked. “I mean couldn’t we just sort of take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time?”

He smiled at her like a patient psychiatrist. “I don’t think I suggested that we ‘talk about everything all the time,’ ” he said. “I certainly didn’t mean to. All I meant to sug—”

“All right,” she said, backing away another step. “It’s because I don’t love you. How’s that?”

Luckily the bland psychiatrist’s smile was still on his face; it saved him from taking her seriously. “That isn’t much of an answer,” he said kindly. “I wonder what you really feel. I wonder if what you’re really doing here isn’t sort of trying to evade everything until you’re—well, until you’re in analysis. Sort of trying to resign from personal responsibility between now and the time you begin your treatment.

Do you suppose that might be it?”

“No.” She had turned away from him. “Oh, I don’t know; yes. Whatever you like. Put it whichever way makes you the most comfortable.”

“Well,” he said, “it’s hardly a question of making me comfortable. All I’m saying is that life does have to go on, analysis or not. Hell, I know you’re having a bad time just now; it has been a tough summer. The point is we’ve both been under a strain, and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can. I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately; matter of fact I’ve been thinking it might be a good idea for me to see the headshrinker myself. Actually—” He turned and stood looking out the window, tightening his jaw. “Actually, one of the reasons I’ve been hoping we could get together again is because there’s something I’d like to tell you about: something kind of—well, kind of neurotic and irrational that happened to me a few weeks ago.”



And almost, if not quite, before he knew what his voice was up to, he was telling her about Maureen Grube. He did it with automatic artfulness, identifying her only as “a girl in New York, a girl I hardly even know,” rather than as a typist at the office, careful to stress that there had been no emotional involvement on his part while managing to imply that her need for him had been deep and ungovern-able. His voice, soft and strong with an occasional husky falter or hesitation that only enhanced its rhythm, combined the power of confession with the narrative grace of romantic storytelling.

“And I think the main thing was simply a case of feeling that my—well, that my masculinity’d been threatened somehow by all that abortion business; wanting to prove something; I don’t know. Anyway, I broke it off last week; the whole stupid business. It’s over now; really over. If I weren’t sure of that I guess I could never’ve brought myself to tell you about it.”

For half a minute, the only sound in the room was the music on the radio.

“Why did you?” she asked.

He shook his head, still looking out the window. “Baby, I don’t know. I’ve tried to explain it to you; I’m still trying to explain it to myself. That’s what I meant about it’s being a neurotic, irrational kind of thing. I—”

“No,” she said. “I don’t mean why did you have the girl; I mean why did you tell me about it? What’s the point? Is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed to say?”

He looked at her, feeling his face blush and twitch into an embarrassed simper that he tried, unsuccessfully, to make over into the psychiatric smile. “Why don’t you say what you feel?”

She seemed to think this over for a few seconds, and then she shrugged. “I have. I don’t feel anything.”

“In other words you don’t care what I do or who I go to bed with or anything. Right?”

“No; I guess that’s right; I don’t.”

“But I want you to care!”

“I know you do. And I suppose I would, if I loved you; but you see I don’t. I don’t love you and I never really have, and I never really figured it out until this week, and that’s why I’d just as soon not do any talking right now. Do you see?” She picked up a dust cloth and went into the living room, a tired, competent housewife with chores to do.

“And listen to this,” said an urgent voice on the radio.

“Now, during the big Fall Clearance, you’ll find Robert Hall’s entire stock of men’s walk shorts and sport jeans drasti-cally reduced!”

Standing foursquare and staring down at his untouched glass of iced tea on the table, he felt his head fill with such a dense morass of confusion that only one consecutive line of thought came through: an abrupt remembrance of what Sunday this was, which explained why the kids were over at the Campbells’, and which also meant there wasn’t much time left for talking.

“Oh, now listen,” he said, wheeling and following her into the living room with decisive, headlong strides. “You just put down that God damn rag a minute and listen. Listen to me. In the first place, you know God damn well you love me.”
