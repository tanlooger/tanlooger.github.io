“we’re not?” Jennifer said that afternoon. She and Michael were standing in their bathing suits on the living room carpet, with towels drawn around their shoulders like cloaks. They’d been playing in the lawn sprinkler, and their mother had called them indoors ostensibly to “dry off for a minute and have some milk and cookies,” but also, as it turned out, to hear a formal announcement, from both parents, that they weren’t going to France after all. “We’re not? How come?”

“Because Daddy and Mommy have decided it would be better not to just now,” April said. They had settled on this answer a few minutes before (there was no point in telling them about the baby yet) and the words had a stiff, made-up sound which she tried to counteract by adding, very gently, “That’s how come.”

“Oh.” The total neutrality of expression on both children’s faces was emphasized by the fact that their eyes were still sun-dazed and their lips, under smiling spoors of milk, were blue from having stayed in the water too long. Jennifer lifted one bare foot and used it to scratch a mosquito bite on the ankle of her other leg.

“Is that all you’ve got to say?” Frank demanded, with a little more heartiness than he’d planned. “Not even ‘Hur-ray’ or anything? We thought you’d be pleased.”

The children looked briefly at one another and performed bashful smiles. It had become increasingly hard, lately, for either of them to know what was expected. Jennifer wiped away her milk mustache. “Are we going to France later, then, or what?”

“Well,” her mother said. “Maybe. We’ll see. But we certainly won’t be going for a long time, so it’s nothing you need to be thinking about any more.”

“So we’ll be staying here,” Jennifer said helpfully, “but not forever and ever.”

“That’s about right, Niffer. Give Mommy a kiss now, and then how about both of you going out and getting some sun? And try staying out of the water for a while, okay?

Your lips are all blue. You can each have a couple more cookies, if you want.”

“Know what we can do, Niffer?” Michael said as soon as they were outside again. “Know that place up in the woods where the big tree’s fallen over and it’s got this little branch you can sit on and make a pretend soda fountain? We can take our cookies up there and you can be the lady coming into the soda fountain and I can be the soda fountain man.”

“I don’t feel like it.”

“Come on. And I’ll say ‘What would you like to eat today?’ And you’ll say ‘A cookie, please,’ and I’ll say—”

“I don’t feel like it, I said. It’s too hot.” And she sat well away from him on the scorched grass. Why was it “better not to just now”? And why had her mother looked so funny and sad when she said “That’s about right”? And why had her father stayed home from work when he wasn’t even sick?

When Michael finished eating he ran crazily out along the crest of the front-yard slope, flailing his arms. “Look at me, Niffer, look at me, look at me—I’m falling down dead!”

He wobbled and fell, rolled over a few times and lay very flat and still in the grass, giggling to himself at how funny it must have looked. But she wasn’t watching. She had walked up close to the picture window and was peeking inside.

They were still sitting on the sofa, leaning a little toward each other, and her mother was nodding and her father was talking. It was funny to see his hands making little gestures in the air and his mouth, moving and moving, with no sound coming out. After a while her mother went away to the kitchen and her father went on sitting there alone.

Then he got up and went down to the cellar and came outdoors with his shovel, to work on the stone path.

“Oh, I don’t know whether to be sad or glad,” said Milly Campbell a few nights later, squirming deep into the sofa cushions. “I mean it’s a darn shame and everything for you folks, I guess you’re awfully disappointed, but I mean personally I’m just as pleased as I can be. Aren’t you, sweetie?”

And Shep, after a tremulous sip of gin and tonic that brought the ice cubes clicking painfully against his front teeth, said he sure was.

But the truth was that he wasn’t sure of anything. For weeks now, in an effort to put April Wheeler out of his mind, he had drawn solace from a daydream in which ten years had passed: the Wheelers were coming back from Europe, the Campbells were meeting the boat, and from the moment April came down the gangplank he saw that she’d grown thick and stumpy from her decade of breadwinning.

Her cheeks had sagged into jowls, she stood and moved like a man and talked in a sarcastic, squint-eyed way with a cigarette wagging in her lips. Whenever this vision faltered he contented himself with a single-minded cataloguing of her present imperfections (She was too heavy across the beam; her voice did get too shrill when she was tense; there was something nervous and artificial about her smile), and every time he saw a pretty girl, on the beach or at traffic lights on his daily drive to Stamford and back, he would use her to strengthen his belief that the world was full of better-looking, more intelligent, finer and more desirable women than April Wheeler. Throughout this period too he had schooled himself to be more than ordinarily fond of Milly.

He had paid her numberless little courtly attentions; once he had picked out an expensive blouse at the best shop in Stamford and brought it home to her (“What do you mean, what for? Because you’re my girl, that’s what for . . .”), and he had enjoyed the impression that she was flowering into a new serenity at his touch.

And now it was all shot to hell. The Wheelers weren’t going anywhere. Milly was sitting here chattering about pregnancy and babies, with her new blouse already missing a button and gray around the armpits; April Wheeler was as cool and beautiful as ever. He cleared his throat. “So you figure you’ll be staying on here indefinitely, then?”

he asked. “Or will you be getting a bigger house, or what?”

“Ah,” said Jack Ordway. “So. Foiled by faulty contracep-tion. Well, Franklin, I can’t say I’m sorry. You’d have been sorely missed here in the old cubicle, I can promise you that. Besides which—” he leaned elegantly back in his creaking swivel chair and threw one ankle over his knee—

“apart from which, if you’ll forgive me, the whole European scheme did sound a bit—a tiny bit unrealistic, sort of. None of my business, I’m sure.”

“Pull up a chair, uh, Frank,” said Bart Pollock. “What’s on your mind?”

It was the hottest day of the year, the kind of a day when everyone on the Fifteenth Floor discussed how scandalous it was that a company the size of Knox did not have air conditioning, yet Frank had expected that Pollock’s private office, here on the Twentieth, would somehow be cooler. He had imagined too that Pollock would greet him standing up, perhaps striding across the carpet with hand outstretched, and that as soon as the formalities were out of the way (“Frank, I’m tickled to death . . .”) they might adjourn to do business over a brace of Tom Collinses in some air-conditioned cocktail lounge. Instead they were sitting stiff and damp under the irritating buzz of an electric fan. The room was smaller than it looked from the outside, and Pollock, wearing a surprisingly cheap summer shirt through which the outlines of his soaked undershirt were clearly visible, looked more like an exhausted salesman than a top executive. His desk, though appropriately wide and glass-topped, bore as many disorderly piles of paper as Frank’s own. Its only ornament suggesting the luxury of rank was a cork-and-silver tray that held a stout little thermos jug for ice water and a tumbler, and a careful inspection of this display revealed that all its elements were finely coated with dust.

“Mm,” he said when Frank had finished. “Well, that’s fine. I’m personally very glad you’ve come to this decision.

Now of course, as I’ve told you—” He closed his bulbous eyes and tenderly rubbed their lids. This didn’t mean he had forgotten anything; Frank could see that. Everything was all right. It was just that no man could be jubilant in a room like this, on a day like this; and besides, what they were talking about was, after all, a matter of business. “As I mentioned that day at lunch, this whole project’s still in the development stage. I’ll be calling you in for conferences from time to time as the thing shapes up; meanwhile I’d suggest you keep on with these whaddyacallits, these promotion pieces of yours. I’ll give Ted a buzz and tell him you’re working on something for me. That’s all he’ll need to know for the time being. Right?”

“Changed your what?” said Mrs. Givings, frowning fear-fully into the black perforations of her telephone. She was nearing the end of a bleak and very trying day, the whole afternoon of which had been spent at Greenacres—first sitting for unendurable lengths of time on various benches in the waxed and disinfected corridor, waiting for an appointment with John’s doctor, then sitting in wretched politeness beside the doctor’s desk while he told her that John’s behavior in the past several weeks had been “not very encouraging, I’m afraid,” and that “I think we’d better call a halt to these outings of his for a while, say five or six weeks.”

“But he’s been perfectly fine with us,” she had lied.

“That’s what I was going to tell you. Oh, things did get a little out of hand this last time, as I said, but in general he’s seemed very relaxed. Very cheerful.”

“Yes. Unfortunately, we can only proceed on the basis of our own, ah, our own observations here in the ward. Tell me, what does his attitude seem to be at the conclusion of the visits? How does he seem to feel about coming back to the hospital each time?”

“He couldn’t be sweeter about it. Really, Doctor, he’s just as willing and cooperative as a lamb.”

“Yes.” And the doctor had fingered his loathsome tie clasp. “Well, actually, you see, it would probably be a healthier sign if he showed some reluctance. Let’s say”—he frowned at his calendar—“let’s say at least until the first Sunday in September. Then we might try again.”

He might as well have said never. By the first Sunday in September, in all probability, the Wheelers would be on their way to the other side of the world. Now, feeling enormously tired, she had called the Wheelers to cancel the next date they had made—she would have to find other excuses for the other Sundays from now on—and April Wheeler, whose voice sounded small and very far away, was trying to tell her that something was changed. Why did everything always change, when all you wanted, all you had ever humbly asked of whatever God there might be, was that certain things be allowed to remain the same?

“Changed your what? . . .” Then all at once Mrs. Givings was aware of the blood in her veins. “. . . Oh, changed your plans. Oh, then you’re not ready to sell . . .” and her pencil began to draw a row of black, five-pointed stars across the top of her scratch pad—to draw them with such furious pressure that their joyful shapes were embossed on all the pages underneath. “Oh, I am so glad to hear that, April. Really, this is the best news I’ve had in I don’t know how long. So you’ll be staying here with us, then . . .” She was afraid she might begin to cry; but luckily April was apologizing now for “all the trouble you’ve gone to about putting the house on the market,” which allowed her to retreat into the protection of a cool, tolerant business-woman’s chuckle. “Oh, no, please don’t mention that.

Really, it’s been no trouble at all. . . . All right, then . . .

Fine, then, April . . . Good. We’ll be in touch.”

When she put the receiver back it was as if she were returning a rare and exquisite jewel to its velvet case.

A bad dream or a shrill bird, or both, woke him much too early in the morning and filled him with a sense of dread—a feeling that his next breath and blink of wakefulness would recall him to the knowledge of a grief, a burden of bad news from yesterday that sleep had only temporarily eased. It took him at least a minute to remember that it was good news, not bad: yesterday had been the last of the first week in August. The deadline had come and gone. The debate was over, and he had won.

He raised himself on one elbow to look at her in the blue light—she was turned away from him with her face hidden under a tangle of hair—and nestled close to her back with his arm around her. He arranged his face in a smile of contentment and his limbs in an attitude of total peace, but it didn’t work. Half an hour later he was still awake, wanting a cigarette and watching the sky turn to morning.

The peculiar thing was that in the past week or so they hadn’t mentioned it. Each afternoon he had come home ready to intercept whatever last-minute points of argument she might raise—he had even cut down on his drinking, so that his head would be clear for discussion—but each evening they had either talked of other things or hadn’t talked at all. Last night she had set up the ironing board in front of the television set and worked there, glancing up every few seconds from the steaming whisk and glide of the iron to peer, frowning, at whatever mottled image was cavorting on the screen.

What do you want to talk for? her profile seemed to be saying, in reply to his uneasy gaze from across the room. What is there to talk about? Haven’t we done enough talking?

When she turned off the television and folded up the ironing board at last, he went over and touched her arm.

“You know what this is?”

“What what is? What do you mean?”

“Today. It’s the last day of the—you know. If you’d gone ahead with that business, this would’ve been your last day for doing it.”

“Oh. Yes, I suppose that’s true.”

He patted her shoulder, feeling clumsy. “No regrets?”

“Well,” she said, “I guess I’d better not have any, had I?

Be a little late for them now, wouldn’t it?” She carried the ironing board awkwardly away, one of its legs dangling, and she was all the way to the kitchen door before it occurred to him to help her. He sprang to her side.

“Here, let me take that.”

“Oh. Thank you.”

And in bed, without a word, they made a sensible, tem -

perate, mature kind of love. The last thing he said before falling asleep was, “Listen. We’re going to be all right.”

“I hope so,” she whispered. “I hope so; very much.”

Then he had slept, and now he was awake.

He got up and went padding through the silent house. The kitchen was alight with all the colors of the sunrise—it was a beautiful morning—and the calendar had lost its power.

There it hung, through the courtesy of A. J. Stolper and Sons, a document useful only in the paying of bills and the making of dental appointments. Days and weeks could pass now without anyone’s caring; a month might vanish before anyone thought to tear away the page for the month before.

Franklin H. Wheeler poured himself a glass of ice-cold orange juice, the color of the sun, and sipped it slowly at the kitchen table, afraid it would sicken him to take it all at once.

He had won but he didn’t feel like a winner. He had successfully righted the course of his life but he felt himself more than ever a victim of the world’s indifference. It didn’t seem fair.

Only very gradually, there at the table, was he able to sort out and identify what it was that had haunted him on waking, that had threatened to make him gag on his orange juice and now prevented his enjoyment of the brilliant grass and trees and sky beyond the window.

It was that he was going to have another child, and he wasn’t at all sure that he wanted one.

“Knowing what you’ve got, comma,” said the living human voice in the playback of the Dictaphone, “knowing what you need, comma, knowing what you can do without, dash. That’s inventory control.

“Paragraph . . .”

It was suddenly past the middle of August, and two weeks had elapsed since his last talk with Pollock, or possibly three; time, now that he’d overcome the need to measure and apportion it, had again begun to slip away from him.

“You mean to say it’s Friday already?” he was apt to demand on what he’d thought was Tuesday or Wednesday, and it wasn’t until lunchtime today, when he passed a store window featuring a display of autumn leaves and the words back to school, that he realized the summer was over.

Very soon now it would be time for topcoats, and then it would be Christmas.

“The main thing I have to do now,” he had recently explained to April, “is to finish this Speaking-of series. I mean I can’t very well expect to talk money with him until I’ve done that, can I?”

“No; I suppose not. You know best.”

“Well, I can’t. I mean we can’t expect any miraculous changes overnight in a thing like this; it’s the kind of a thing that can’t be rushed.”

“Do I seem to be rushing you? Really, Frank; how many ways can I say it? It’s entirely up to you.”

“I know,” he said. “I know, of course I know that. Anyway, I do want to get the damn series done as soon as possible. I’ll probably stay in late a couple of nights this week to work on it.”

And he’d taken to staying in late nearly every night since then. He rather enjoyed having dinner alone in town and taking walks through the city at evening before catching the late train. It gave him a pleasant sense of independence, of freedom from the commuter’s round; and besides, it seemed a suitable practice for the new, mature, non-sentimental kind of marriage that was evidently going to be their way from now on.

The only trouble was that this second Speaking-of piece had turned out to be much harder than the first. He had finished it twice now, and each time had discovered gaping errors of logic or emphasis that seemed to demand a total revision.

The office clock read five-forty-five as he listened to the playback of his third and final revision, and the silence beyond his cubicle proved that even the last and most drea-rily conscientious people on the Fifteenth Floor had gone home; soon the platoons of scrubwomen would arrive with mops and buckets. When the recording had droned to its conclusion he felt nicely exhilarated. It wasn’t very good, but it would do. Now he could take off uptown and have a couple of drinks before dinner.

He was in the act of leaning over to shut off the machine when the click, click, click of a woman’s heels came delicately up the aisle outside. He knew at once that it was Maureen Grube, that she had purposely stayed late in order to be alone with him, and that he was going to take her out tonight. It seemed important not to look openly into the aisle as she passed; instead he remained hunched over the Dictaphone, peeking at the doorway from cover. It was Maureen, all right; the quick glimpse he caught of her was more than enough to confirm that. It was enough to show him that an inch of petticoat was switching nicely through a vent in the hem of her skirt with every step and that her face, as subtly averted as his own, had not quite dared to glance in at him.

Her footsteps receded, and as he waited confidently for their return he reset the machine to the “start” position and leaned back in his chair to listen. That way he could be staring frankly into the aisle, yet quite legitimately occupied with business, when she came by again.

“Copy for Veritype,” the Dictaphone said. “Title: Speaking of Inventory Control, parenthesis, revision three. Paragraph. Knowing what you’ve got, comma, knowing what you need, comma, knowing what you can do without, dash.

That’s—”

“Oh.” She had stopped directly in his line of vision, and her careful expression of surprise was somewhat vitiated by the deep, permanent-looking blush that had suffused her face and neck. “Hello, Frank. Working late?”

He shut off the machine and got slowly to his feet, moving toward her with the loose, almost sleepy gait of a man who knows exactly what he’s doing.

“Hi,” he said.
