title: FIVE

“oh, it’s such a lovely luxury just to ride instead of driving,” Mrs. Givings said, holding fast to the handle of the passenger’s door. Her husband always drove on these trips to the hospital, and she never failed to remark on how relaxing a change it made for her. When one drove a car all day and every day, she would point out, there was no more marvelous vacation in the world than sitting back and letting someone else take over. But the force of habit was strong: she continued to watch the road as attentively as if she were holding the wheel, and her right foot would reach out and press the rubber floor mat at the approach of every turn or stop signal. Sometimes, catching herself at this, she would force her eyes to observe the passing countryside and will the sinews of her back to loosen and subside into the upholstery. As a final demonstration of self-control she might even uncoil her hand from the door handle and put it in her lap.

“My, isn’t this a marvelous day?” she asked. “Oh, and look at the beautiful leaves, just beginning to turn. Is there anything nicer than the beginning of fall? All the wonderful colors and the crispness in the air; it always takes me back to dear look OUT!”





Her shoe slapped the floor mat and her body arched into a frantic posture of bracing against the impact of collision: a red truck was turning out of a side road, straight ahead.

“I see it, dear,” Howard Givings said, smoothly applying the brakes so that the truck had ample room to pass, and afterwards, easing down on the accelerator again, he said:

“You just relax, now, and let me worry about the driving.”

“Oh, I know; I will. I’m sorry. I know I’m being silly.”

She took several deep breaths and folded her hands on her thigh, where they rested as tentatively as frightened birds.

“It’s just that I always do get such awful butterflies in my stomach on these visiting days, especially when it’s been so long.”

“Patient’s name?” asked the painfully thin girl at the visitors’ desk.

“John Givings,” Mrs. Givings said with a polite dip of her head, and she watched the girl’s chewed pencil proceed down a mimeographed list of names until it stopped at Givings, John.

“Relationship?”

“Parents.”

“Sign here please and take this slip. Ward Two A, upstairs and to your right. Have the patient back by five p.m.”

In the outer waiting room of Ward Two A, after they had pressed the bell marked ring for attendant, Mr. and Mrs.

Givings shyly joined a group of other visitors who were inspecting an exhibition of patients’ artwork. The pictures included a faithfully rendered likeness of Donald Duck, in crayon, and an elaborate purple-and-brown crucifixion scene in which the sun, or moon, was done in the same crimson paint as the drops of blood that fell at precisely measured intervals from the wound in the Savior’s ribs.

In a minute they heard a dim thudding of rubber heels and a jingle of keys behind the locked door; then it opened on a heavy, bespectacled young man in white who said,

“May I have your slips, please?” and allowed them to pass, two at a time, into the inner waiting room. This was a large, dimly lighted place containing bright plastic-topped tables and chairs for the visitors of patients not on the privilege list. Most of the tables were occupied, but there was very little sound of conversation. At the table nearest the door a young Negro couple sat holding hands, and it wasn’t easy to identify the man as a patient until you noticed that his other hand was holding the chromium leg of the table in a yellow-knuckled grip of desperation, as if it were the rail of a heaving ship. Farther away, an old woman was combing the tangled hair of her son, whose age could have been anything between twenty-five and forty; his head wobbled sub-missively under her strokes as he ate a peeled banana.

The attendant, hooking his ring of keys to a clip against his hip pocket, struck off down the corridor of the ward and began sonorously calling out names from the slips he had collected. Looking after him down the mouth of the corridor, which was filled with the sound of many radios tuned to different stations, all you could see was a long expanse of waxed linoleum and the corners of several steel hospital beds.

After a while the attendant came back, walking neat and white at the head of a small, shabby parade. John Givings brought up the rear, tall and pigeon-toed, buttoning his sweater with one hand and carrying the twill workman’s cap in the other.

“Well,” he said, greeting his parents. “They letting the prisoners out in the sunshine today? Big deal.” He carefully placed the cap dead-center on his head, and the picture of the public charge was complete. “Let’s go.”

No one spoke in the car until they were clear of the hospital grounds, past the ranks of long brick ward buildings, past the administration building and the softball diamond, out around the well-tended circle of grass that enclosed the twin white shafts of the State and American flags, and on up the long blacktop road that led to the highway. Mrs. Givings, riding in the back seat (she usually found it more comfortable there when John was in front), tried to gauge his mood by studying the back of his neck. Then she said:

“John?”

“Mm?”

“We have some good news. You know the Wheelers, that you liked so much? They’ve very kindly asked us to drop by again today, by the way, if you’d like to; that’s one thing; but the really good news is that they’ve decided to stay. They’re not going to Europe after all. Isn’t that lovely?” And with an uneasy smile she watched him slowly turn around to face her over the seat back.

“What happened?” he said.

“Well, I’m sure I don’t—how do you mean, what happened, dear? I don’t suppose anything necessarily ‘happened’; I imagine they simply talked it over and changed their minds.”

“You mean you didn’t even ask? People’re all set to do something as big as that and then they drop the whole idea, and you don’t even ask what the deal is? Why?”



“Well, John, I suppose because I didn’t feel it was my business to ask. One doesn’t in quire into these things, dear, unless the other person wishes to volunteer the infor mation. ” In an effort to still the rising cautionary note in her voice, which was almost certain to antagonize him, she forced the skin of her forehead and mouth to assume the shape of a jolly smile. “Can’t we just be pleased that they’re staying, without inquiring into the why of it? Oh, look at that lovely old red silo. I’ve never noticed that one before, have you? That must be the tallest silo for miles around.”

“It’s a lovely old silo, Ma,” John said. “And it’s lovely news about the Wheelers, and you’re a lovely person. Isn’t she, Pop? Isn’t she a lovely person?”

“All right, John,” Howard Givings said. “Let’s steady down, now.”

Mrs. Givings, whose fingers were grinding and tearing a book of matches into moist shreds, closed her eyes and tried to fortify herself for what would almost certainly be an awkward afternoon.

Her anxiety was compounded at the Wheelers’ kitchen door. They were home—both cars were there—but the house had a strangely unwelcoming look, as if they weren’t expecting visitors. There was no answer to her very light knock on the glass pane of the door, which gave back a vivid reflection of sky and trees, of her own craning face and the faces of Howard and John behind her. She knocked again, and this time she made a visor of one hand and pressed it to the pane, to see inside. The kitchen was empty (she could see what looked like a glass of iced tea on the table) but just then Frank Wheeler came lunging in from the living room, looking awful—looking as if he were about to scream or to weep or to commit violence. She saw at once that he hadn’t heard her knock and didn’t know she was there: he hadn’t come to answer the door but in desperate escape from the living room, possibly from the house itself. And there wasn’t time for her to step back before he saw her—caught her crouched and peering into his very eyes—which made him start, stop, and arrange his features into a smile that matched her own.

“Well,” he said, opening the door. “Hi, there. Come on in.”

Then they were moving sociably into the living room, where April was, and April looked awful too: pale and hag-gard, twisting her fingers at her waist. “Nice to see you all,”

she was saying faintly. “Won’t you sit down? I’m afraid the house is in a terrible mess.”

“Are we awfully early?” Mrs. Givings asked.

“Early? No, no; we were just—would anyone like a drink? Or some—iced tea, or something?”

“Oh, nothing at all, thanks. Actually we can only stay a minute; we just dropped by to say hello.”

The party fell into an odd, uncomfortable grouping: the three Givingses seated in a row; the two Wheelers standing backed up against the bookcase, restlessly shifting toward and then apart from each other as they made conversation.

Only now, watching them, was Mrs. Givings able to hazard a guess at the cause of their constraint: they must have been quarreling.

“Listen,” John said, and all the other talk stopped dead.

“What’s the deal, anyway? I mean I hear you people changed your minds. How come?”

“Well,” Frank said, and chuckled in embarrassment.

“Well, not exactly. You might say our minds were sort of—

forcibly changed for us.”



“How come?”

Frank made a little sidling skip to stand close to his wife, edging behind her. “Well,” he said. “I should’ve thought that was fairly obvious by now.” And Mrs. Givings’s eyes were drawn, for the first time, to notice what April was wearing. Maternity clothes!

“Oh, April!” she cried. “Why, this is perfectly marvelous!” She wondered what one was expected to do on such occasions: should she get up and—well, kiss her, or something? But April didn’t look like a girl who wanted to be kissed. “Oh, I think this is terribly exciting,” Mrs. Givings went on, and “I can’t tell you how pleased I am,” and

“Oh, but I expect you’ll be needing a bigger house, now, won’t you?” and through it all she hoped against hope that John would keep still. But:

“Hold it a second, Ma,” he said, standing up. “Hold it a second. I don’t get this.” And he fixed on Frank the stare of a prosecuting attorney. “What’s so obvious about it? I mean okay, she’s pregnant; so what? Don’t people have babies in Europe?”

“Oh John, really,” said Mrs. Givings. “I don’t think we need to—”

“Ma, will you keep out of this? I’m asking the man a question. If he doesn’t want to give me the answer, I’m assuming he’ll have sense enough to tell me so.”

“Of course,” Frank said, smiling down at his shoes.

“Suppose we just say that people anywhere aren’t very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them. As it happens, the only way we can afford this one is by staying here. It’s a question of money, you see.”

“Okay.” John nodded in apparent satisfaction, looking from one of the Wheelers to the other. “Okay; that’s a good reason.” They both looked relieved, but Mrs. Givings went tight all over because she knew, from long experience, that something perfectly awful was coming next.

“Money’s always a good reason,” John said. He began to move around the carpet, hands in his pockets. “But it’s hardly ever the real reason. What’s the real reason? Wife talk you out of it, or what?” And he turned the full force of his dazzling smile on April, who had moved across the room to stab out her cigarette in an ash tray. Her eyes looked briefly up at him and then down again.

“Huh?” he persisted. “Little woman decide she isn’t quite ready to quit playing house? Nah, nah, that’s not it. I can tell. She looks too tough. Tough and female and adequate as hell. Okay, then; it must’ve been you.” And he swung around to Frank. “What happened?”

“John, please,” Mrs. Givings said. “You’re being very—”

But there was no stopping him now.

“What happened? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you like it here after all? You figure it’s more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or—Wow, that did it!

Look at his face! What’s the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?”

“John, you’re being impossibly rude. Howard, please—”

“All right, son,” Howard Givings said, getting to his feet.

“I think we’d better be—”

“Boy!” John broke into his braying laugh. “Boy! You know something? I wouldn’t be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose, just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress.”

“Now, look, ” said Frank Wheeler, and to Mrs. Givings’s shocked surprise his fists were clenched and he was trembling from head to foot. “I think that’s just about enough outa you. I mean who the hell do you think you are?

You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head, and I think it’s about time somebody told you to keep your God damn—”

“He’s not well, Frank,” Mrs. Givings managed to say, and then she bit the inside of her lip in consternation.

“Oh, not well my ass. I’m sorry, Mrs. Givings, but I don’t give a damn if he’s well or sick or dead or alive, I just wish he’d keep his God damn opinions in the God damn insane asylum where they belong.”

During the painful silence that followed this, while Mrs.

Givings continued to chew her lip, they all stood grouped in the middle of the room: Howard intently folding a light raincoat over his arm; April staring red-faced at the floor; Frank still trembling and audibly breathing, with a terrible mixture of defiance and humiliation in his eyes. John, whose smile was now serene, was the only one of them who seemed at peace.

“Big man you got here, April,” he said, winking at her as he fitted the workman’s cap on his head. “Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other. Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I’m beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean come to think of it, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he’s got a pair of balls.”

“All right, John,” Howard was murmuring. “Let’s get on out to the car now.”

“April,” Mrs. Givings whispered. “I can’t tell you how sorry I—”

“Right,” John said, moving away with his father. “Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay Ma? Have I said ‘Sorry’ enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I’m just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don’t have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I?”

And at least, Mrs. Givings thought, if nothing else could be salvaged from this horrible day, at least he was allowing Howard to lead him away quietly. All she had to do now was to follow them, to find some way of getting across this floor and out of this house, and then it would all be over.

But John wasn’t finished yet. “Hey, I’m glad of one thing, though,” he said, stopping near the door and turning back, beginning to laugh again, and Mrs. Givings thought she would die as he extended a long yellow-stained index finger and pointed it at the slight mound of April’s pregnancy.

“You know what I’m glad of? I’m glad I’m not gonna be that kid.”
