april johnson wheeler watched her husband’s face withdraw, she felt the light squeeze of his hand on her arm and heard his words, and smiled at him.

“So long,” she answered.

She followed him outside to stand on the kitchen steps and watch, hugging her arms against the morning chill, while he started up the station car and brought it rumbling out into the sunshine. His flushed profile, thrust out and facing the rear as the car moved past, revealed nothing but the sobriety of a man with a pardonable pride in knowing how to back a car efficiently down a hill. She walked out to a sunny place in front of the carport to see him off, watching the crumpled shape of the old Ford get smaller and smaller.

At the end of the driveway, as he backed it out and around into the road, a gleam of sun on the windshield eclipsed his face. She held up her hand and waved anyway, in case he was looking, and when he came into view again as the car straightened out it was clear that he’d seen her. He was bending and grinning up at her, neat and happy in his gabardine suit, his blazing white shirt and dark tie, answering her wave with a small, jaunty wave of his own; then he was gone.

Her smile continued until she was back in the kitchen, clearing away the breakfast dishes into a steaming sinkful of suds; she was still smiling, in fact, when she saw the paper napkin with the diagram of the computer on it, and even then her smile didn’t fade: it simply spread and trembled and locked itself into a stiff grimace while the spasms worked at her aching throat, again and again, and the tears broke and ran down her cheeks as fast as she could wipe them away.

She got some music on the radio, to steady her nerves, and by the time she’d finished washing the dishes she was all right again. Her gums were sore from too many cigarettes during the night, her hands were inclined to shake and she was more aware of her heartbeats than usual; otherwise she felt fine. It was a shock, though, when the radio announcer said “Eight forty-five”; it seemed like noon, or early afternoon. She washed her face in cold water and took several deep breaths, trying to slow her heart down; then she lit a cigarette and composed herself at the telephone.

“Hello, Milly?

. . . Hi. Everything all right? . . . My voice sounds what? . . . Oh. Well, no, actually, I’m not feeling any better; that’s really why I called. . . . Are you sure you don’t mind? I mean it may not be for the whole night again; maybe Frank’ll want to come over and get them this evening, depending how things work out; but I guess we’d better leave it open, just in case. . . . Well, that’s really wonderful of you, Milly, I do appreciate it. . . . Oh no, I’m sure it’s nothing serious; it’s just—you know, one of those things. . . . All right, then. Give them a kiss for me, and tell them one or the other of us’ll be stopping by to pick them up, either tonight or tomorrow. . . . What? . . . Oh, well—

no, not if they’re outdoors playing. Don’t call them in.”

The cigarette broke and shredded in her fingers; she let it drop into the ash tray and used both hands to grip the telephone. “Just give them—you know; give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them— you know. . . . All right, Milly. Thanks.”

And she barely managed to get the phone back in its cradle before she was crying again. To control herself she lit another cigarette, but it gagged her and she had to go to the bathroom and stand there for a long time, retching dryly even after she’d lost what little breakfast she’d managed to eat. Afterwards, she washed her face again and brushed her teeth, and then it was time to get busy.

“Have you thought it through, April?” Aunt Claire used to say, holding up one stout, arthritic forefinger. “Never undertake to do a thing until you’ve thought it through; then do the best you can.”

The first thing to do was to straighten up the house, and in particular to straighten up the desk, where the hours and hours of her trying to think it through, last night, had left a mess of remnants. The heaped-up ash tray was there, and the opened bottle of ink surrounded by spilled ashes, and the coffee cup containing a dried brown ring. She had only to sit down at the desk and switch on its lamp to bring back the harsh, desolate flavor of the small hours.

In the wastebasket, lumped and crumpled, lay all the failures of the letter she had tried to write. She picked one of them out and opened it and spread it flat, but at first she couldn’t read it: she could only marvel at how cramped and black and angry the handwriting looked, like row on row of precisely swatted mosquitos. Then part of it, halfway down the page, came into focus:



. . . your cowardly self-delusions about “love” when you know as well as I do that there’s never been anything between us but contempt and dis-trust and a terrible sickly dependence on each other’s weakness—that’s why. That’s why I couldn’t stop laughing today when you said that about the Inability to Love, and that’s why I can’t stand to let you touch me, and that’s why I’ll never again believe in anything you think, let alone in anything you say . . .

She didn’t want to read the rest because she knew it wasn’t worth reading. It was weak with hate, like all the other abortive letters on all the other crumpled papers; all of them would have to be burned.

It wasn’t until five this morning—and could that really have been only four hours ago?—that she’d finally stopped trying to write the letter. She had forced herself up from the desk then, aching with tiredness, and gone in to take a deep, warm bath, lying very still under the still water for a long time, like a patient in therapy. Afterwards, feeling absent-minded and greatly calmed, she had gone into the bedroom to get dressed; and there he was, on his back.

The sight of him, in the early blue light, sprawled out and twisted in his wrinkled Sunday sports clothes, had been as much of a shock as if she’d found a stranger in the bed.

When she sat down in the reek of whiskey to get a closer look at his flushed, sleeping face, she began to understand the real cause of her shock: it was much more than the knowledge that she didn’t love him. It was that she didn’t, she couldn’t possibly hate him. How could anyone hate him? He was—well, he was Frank.

Then he’d made a little snoring moan and his lips had begun to work as he groped for her hand. “Oh, baby. Oh, my baby, don’t go away . . .”

“Sh-sh-sh. It’s all right. It’s all right, Frank. Go to sleep.”



And that was when she’d thought it through.

So it hadn’t been wrong or dishonest of her to say no this morning, when he asked if she hated him, any more than it had been wrong or dishonest to serve him the elaborate breakfast and to show the elaborate interest in his work, and to kiss him goodbye. The kiss, for that matter, had been exactly right—a perfectly fair, friendly kiss, a kiss for a boy you’d just met at a party, a boy who’d danced with you and made you laugh and walked you home afterwards, talking about himself all the way.

The only real mistake, the only wrong and dishonest thing, was ever to have seen him as anything more than that. Oh, for a month or two, just for fun, it might be all right to play a game like that with a boy; but all these years!

And all because, in a sentimentally lonely time long ago, she had found it easy and agreeable to believe whatever this one particular boy felt like saying, and to repay him for that pleasure by telling easy, agreeable lies of her own, until each was saying what the other most wanted to hear—until he was saying “I love you” and she was saying “Really, I mean it; you’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met.”

What a subtle, treacherous thing it was to let yourself go that way! Because once you’d started it was terribly difficult to stop; soon you were saying “I’m sorry, of course you’re right,”

and “Whatever you think is best,” and “You’re the most wonderful and valuable thing in the world,” and the next thing you knew all honesty, all truth, was as far away and glimmer-ing, as hopelessly unattainable as the world of the golden people. Then you discovered you were working at life the way the Laurel Players worked at The Petrified Forest, or the way Steve Kovick worked at his drums—earnest and sloppy and full of pretension and all wrong; you found you were saying yes when you meant no, and “We’ve got to be together in this thing” when you meant the very opposite; then you were breathing gasoline as if it were flowers and abandoning yourself to a delirium of love under the weight of a clumsy, grunting, red-faced man you didn’t even like—Shep Campbell!—and then you were face to face, in total darkness, with the knowledge that you didn’t know who you were.

And how could anyone else be blamed for that?

When she’d straightened up the desk and made Frank’s bed, with fresh sheets, she carried the wastebasket outdoors and around to the back yard. It was an autumnal day, warm but with a light sharp breeze that scudded stray leaves over the grass and reminded her of all the brave beginnings of childhood, of the apples and pencils and new woolen clothes of the last few days before school.

She took the wastebasket out across the lawn to the incinerator drum, dumped the papers in it and set a match to them. Then she sat down on the edge of the sun-warmed stone wall to wait for their burning, watching the all but invisible flame crawl slowly and then more rapidly up and around them, sending out little waves of heat that shim-mered the landscape. The sounds of bird song and rustling trees were faintly mingled with the faraway cries of children at play; she listened carefully but couldn’t make out which were Jennifer’s and Michael’s voices and which were the Campbell boys’—or even, with certainty, whether the voices were coming from the Campbells’ part of the Hill.

From a distance, all children’s voices sound the same.

“And listen! Listen!—you know what else she brought me, Margie? Listen! I’m trying to tell you something.”



“Wha-ut?”

Margie Rothenberg and her little brother George and Mary Jane Crawford and Edna Slater were there, fooling around at the place by the hedge where all the grass was worn away, the place with the little cave and the flat rock where they kept their collection of Dixie Cup lids.

“I said you know what else she brought me? My mother?

She brought me this beautiful blue cashmere sweater, for school, and socks that match, and this beautiful little perfume atomizer? This little bottle with a thing that you squeeze? With real perfume in it? Oh, and we drove into White plains with Mr. Minton, that’s my mother’s friend, and we went to the movies and had ice cream and everything, and I stayed up till ten minutes after eleven.”

“How come she was only here two days?” Margie Rothenberg inquired. “You said she was staying a week.

George, you quit that now!”

“I did not; I said she might stay a week. Next time she probably will, or maybe I’ll go and stay a week with her, and if I do that—”

“George! The very next time you pick your nose and eat it I’m gonna tell! I mean it!”

“—and if I do that, you know what? If I do that I won’t have to go to school or anything for a whole week; ha, ha.

Hey Margie? You want to come home and see my sweater and stuff?”

“I can’t. I have to get home in time for ‘Don Winslow.’ ”

“We can hear ‘Don Winslow’ in my house. Come on.”

“I can’t. I have to get home. Come on, Georgie.”

“Hey Edna? Hey Mary Jane? Know what my mother brought me? She brought me this beautiful—Hey, listen Edna. Listen . . .” There was the sound of an upstairs window rattling open, and she knew that if she turned around she would see the dim shape of Aunt Claire peering out through the copper screen.

“Aay-prul!”

“She brought me this beautiful blue sweater, it’s cashmere, and this beautiful—”

“Aay-prul!”

“What? I’m over here.”

“Why didn’t you an swer, then? I want you to come in this instant and get washed and changed. Your father just called. He’s driving out and he’ll be here in fifteen minutes.”

And she ran for the house so fast that her sneakers seemed hardly to touch the ground. Nothing like this had ever, ever happened before: two whole days with her mother, and then, now, the very next day . . .

She took the stairs two at a time and flew to her room and began to undress in such haste that she popped a button off her blouse, saying, “When did he call? What did he say? How long is he staying?”

“I don’t know, dear; he said he’s on his way up to Boston.

You certainly don’t need to tear your clothes. There’s plenty of time.”

Then she was out on the front porch in her party dress, watching down the street for the first glimpse of his long, high-wheeled, beautiful touring car. When it did come into sight, two blocks away, she forced herself not to start running down the path; she waited until it pulled up and stopped in front of the house, so she could watch him get out.

And oh, how tall, how wonderfully slender and straight he was! How golden the sunlight shone on his hair and his laughing face—“Daddy!”—and then she was running, and then she was in his arms.

“How’s my sweetheart?” He smelled of linen and whiskey and tobacco; the short hairs at the back of his neck were bristly to the touch and his jaw was like a warm pumice stone. But his voice was the best of all: as deep and thrilling as blowing across the mouth of an earthen jug.

“Do you know you’ve grown about three feet? I don’t know if I can handle a girl as big as you. Can’t carry you, anyway; I know that much. Let’s go on in and see your Aunt Claire.

How’s everything? How’re all your boy friends?”

In the living room, talking with Aunt Claire, he was marvelous. His slim ankles, beneath trouser cuffs that had been raised to just the right height, were clad in taut socks of fluted black wool; his dark brown shoes were so shapely and so gracefully arranged on the carpet, one a little forward and one back, that she felt she ought to study them for a long time, to commit them to memory as the way a man’s feet ought to look. But her gaze kept straying upward to his princely knees, to his close-fitting vest with its fine little drape of watch chain, to the way he held himself in his chair and to his white-cuffed wrists and hands, one holding a highball glass and the other making slow, easy gestures in the air, and to his brilliant face. There was too much of him for the eye to behold all at once.

He was finishing a joke: “. . . so Eleanor drew herself up and said, ‘Young man, you’re drunk.’ The fellow looked at her and he said, ‘That’s true, Mrs. Roosevelt, I am.’ He said,

‘But here’s the difference, Mrs. Roosevelt: I’ll be all right in the morning.’ ”

Aunt Claire’s thick torso doubled over into her lap and April pretended to think it was unbearably funny too, though she hadn’t heard the first part and wasn’t sure if she would have understood it anyway. But the laughter had scarcely died in the room before he was getting up to leave.

“You mean you’re—you mean you’re not even staying for dinner, Daddy?”

“Sweetie, I’d love to, but I’ve got these people waiting in Boston and they’re going to be very, very angry with your Daddy if he doesn’t get up there in a hurry. How about a kiss?”

And then, hating herself for it, she began acting like a baby. “But you’ve only stayed about an hour. And you—you didn’t even bring me a present or anything and you—”

“Oh, Ape-rull,” Aunt Claire was saying. “Why do you want to go and spoil a nice visit?”

But at least he wasn’t standing up any more: he had squatted nimbly beside her and put his arm around her.

“Sweetie, I’m afraid you’re right about the present, and I feel like a dog about it. Listen, though. Tell you what. Let’s you and I go out to the car and rummage through my stuff, and maybe we can find something after all. Want to try?”

Darkness was falling as they left Aunt Claire and walked together down the path, and the silent interior of the car was filled with a thrilling sense of latent power and speed.

When he turned on the dashboard lights it was like being in a trim, leathery home of their own. Everything they would ever need for living together was here: comfortable places to sit, a means of travel, a lighter for his cigarettes, a little shelf on which she could spread a napkin for the sandwiches and milk that would comprise their meals on the road; and the front and back seats were big enough for sleeping.

“Glove compartment?” he was saying. “Nope; nothing in here but a lot of old maps and things. Well, let’s try the suitcase.” He twisted around and reached into the back seat, where he unfastened the clasps of a big Gladstone. “Let’s see, now. Socks; shirts; that’s no good. Gee, this is quite a problem. You know something? A man ought never to travel without a fresh supply of bangles and spangles; can’t ever tell when he might come across a pretty girl. Oh, look. Wait a second, here’s something. Not much, of course, but something.” He drew out a long brown bottle with the picture of a horse and the words “White Horse” on its label. Something very small was attached to its neck by a ribbon, but he concealed it from view until he opened his penknife and cut it free. Then, holding it by the ribbon, he laid it delicately in her hand—a tiny, perfect white horse.

“There you are, my darling,” he said. “And you can keep it forever.”

The fire was out. She prodded the blackened lumps of paper with a stick to make sure they had burned; there was nothing but ashes.

The children’s voices faintly followed her as she carried the wastebasket back across the lawn; only by going inside and closing the door was she able to shut them out. She turned off the radio too, and the house became extraordi-narily quiet.

She put the wastebasket back in its place and sat down at the desk again with a fresh sheet of paper. This time the letter took no time at all to write. There was only one big, important thing to say, and it was best said in a very few words—so few as to allow no possible elaborations or distortions of meaning.

Dear Frank,

Whatever happens please don’t blame yourself.



From old, insidious habit she almost added the words I love you, but she caught herself in time and made the signa-ture plain: April. She put it in an envelope, wrote Frank on the outside, and left it on the exact center of the desk.

In the kitchen she took down her largest stewing pot, filled it with water and set it on the stove to boil. From stor-age cartons in the cellar she got out the other necessary pieces of equipment: the tongs that had once been used for sterilizing formula bottles, and the blue drugstore box containing the two parts of the syringe, rubber bulb and long plastic nozzle. She dropped these things in the stewing pot, which was just beginning to steam.

By the time she’d made the other preparations, putting a supply of fresh towels in the bathroom, writing down the number of the hospital and propping it by the telephone, the water was boiling nicely. It was wobbling the lid of the pot and causing the syringe to nudge and rumble against its sides.

It was nine-thirty. In another ten minutes she would turn off the heat; then it would take a while for the water to cool.

In the meantime there was nothing to do but wait.

“Have you thought it through, April? Never undertake to do a thing until you’ve—”

But she needed no more advice and no more instruction.

She was calm and quiet now with knowing what she had always known, what neither her parents nor Aunt Claire nor Frank nor anyone else had ever had to teach her: that if you wanted to do something absolutely honest, something true, it always turned out to be a thing that had to be done alone.
