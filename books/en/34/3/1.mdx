our ability to measure and apportion time affords an almost endless source of comfort.

“Synchronize watches at oh six hundred,” says the infantry captain, and each of his huddled lieutenants finds a respite from fear in the act of bringing two tiny pointers into jeweled alignment while tons of heavy artillery go fluttering overhead: the prosaic, civilian-looking dial of the watch has restored, however briefly, an illusion of personal control. Good, it counsels, looking tidily up from the hairs and veins of each terribly vulnerable wrist; fine: so far, everything’s happening right on time.

“I’m afraid I’m booked solid through the end of the month,” says the executive, voluptuously nestling the phone at his cheek as he thumbs the leaves of his appointment calendar, and his mouth and eyes at that moment betray a sense of deep security. The crisp, plentiful, day-sized pages before him prove that nothing unforseen, no calamity of chance or fate can overtake him between now and the end of the month. Ruin and pestilence have been held at bay, and death itself will have to wait; he is booked solid.

“Oh, let me see now,” says the ancient man, tilting his withered head to wince and blink at the sun in bewildered reminiscence, “my first wife passed away in the spring of—”

and for a moment he is touched with terror. The spring of what? Past? Future? What is any spring but a mindless rearrangement of cells in the crust of the spinning earth as it floats in endless circuit of its sun? What is the sun itself but one of a billion insensible stars forever going nowhere into nothingness? Infinity! But soon the merciful valves and switches of his brain begin to do their tired work, and “The spring of Nineteen-Ought-Six,” he is able to say. “Or no, wait—” and his blood runs cold again as the galaxies revolve. “Wait! Nineteen-Ought—Four.” Now he is sure of it, and a restorative flood of well-being brings his hand involuntarily up to slap his thigh in satisfaction. He may have forgotten the shape of his first wife’s smile and the sound of her voice in tears, but by imposing a set of numer-als on her death he has imposed coherence on his own life, and on life itself. Now all the other years can fall obediently into place, each with its orderly contribution to the whole.

Nineteen-Ten, Nineteen-Twenty—Why, of course he remembers!—Nineteen-Thirty, Nineteen-Forty, right on up to the well-deserved peace of his present and on into the gentle promise of his future. The earth can safely resume its benevolent stillness—Smell that new grass!—and it’s the same grand old sun that has hung there smiling on him all these years. “Yes sir,” he can say with authority, “Nineteen-Ought-Four,” and the stars tonight will please him as tokens of his ultimate heavenly rest. He has brought order out of chaos.

The early summer of 1955 might well have been intolerable for both the Wheelers, and might in the end have turned out very differently, if it hadn’t been for the calendar that hung on their kitchen wall. A New Year’s gift of A. J.

Stolper and Sons, Hardware and Home Furnishings, illustrated with scenes of Rural New England, it was the kind of calendar whose page for each month displays two smaller charts as well, last month and next, so that a quarter of the year can be comprehended in a single searching glance.

The Wheelers were able to fix their date of conception in the latter part of the first week in May—the week after his birthday when they could both remember his whispering, “It feels sort of loose,” and her whispering, “Oh no, I’m sure it’s all right; don’t stop . . .” (she had bought a new diaphragm the following week, just to be sure), and this placed the first week in August, more than four weeks away and clear over on the next page, as the mysterious time

“right at the end of the third month” when the school friend, long ago, had said it would be safe to apply the rubber syringe.

Panic had sent her straight to the drugstore the minute she was free of the doctor’s office that afternoon; panic had driven him down the hall to confront her with the thing the minute he found it in the closet that evening, and it was panic that held them locked and staring at each other in the vegetable steam, brutally silent, while the cartoon music floated in from the next room. But much later that same night, after each of them furtively and in turn had made studies of the calendar, their panic was drowned in the discovery that row on row of logical, orderly days lay waiting for intelligent use between now and the deadline. There was plenty of time for coming to the right decision on this thing, for working this thing out.

“Darling, I didn’t mean to be so awful about it; I wouldn’t have been if you hadn’t come at me with it like that, before either of us had a chance to discuss it in any kind of a rational way.”

“I know; I know.” And he patted her softly weeping shoulder. These tears didn’t mean she was capitulating; he knew that. At best they meant what he’d hopefully suspected from the start, that she halfway wanted to be talked out of it; at worst they meant only that she didn’t want to antagonize him, that in drawing her own kind of reassurance from the calendar she had seen the four weeks as a generous opportunity for gradually winning him over. But either way, and this was what filled him with gratitude as he held and stroked her, either way it meant she was considering him; she cared about him. For the time being, that was all that mattered.

“Because I mean we’ve got to be together in this thing, haven’t we?” she asked, drawing back a little in his grip.

“Otherwise nothing’s going to make any sense. Isn’t that right?”

“Of course it is. Can we talk a little now? Because I do have a few things to say.”

“Yes. I want to talk too. Only let’s both promise not to fight, all right? It’s just not a thing we can afford to fight about.”

“I know. Listen . . .”

And so the way was cleared for the quiet, controlled, dead-serious debate with which they began to fill one after another of the calendar’s days, a debate that kept them both in a fine-drawn state of nerves that was not at all unpleasant. It was very like a courtship.



Like a courtship too it took place in a skillfully arranged variety of settings; Frank saw to that. Their numberless hundreds of thousands of words were spoken indoors and out, on long drives through the hills at night, in expensive country restaurants, and in New York. They had as many evenings-out in two weeks as they’d had in the whole previous year, and one of the ways he began to suspect he was winning, early in the second week, was that she didn’t object to spending so much money; she almost certainly would have done so if she’d still been wholly committed to Europe in the fall.

But by then he was in little need of such minor indica-tions. Almost from the start he had seized the initiative, and he was reasonably confident of victory. The idea he had to sell, after all, was clearly on the side of the angels. It was unselfish, mature, and (though he tried to avoid moralizing) morally unassailable. The other idea, however she might try to romanticize its bravery, was repugnant.

“But Frank, don’t you see I only want to do it for your sake? Won’t you please believe that, or try to believe it?”

And he would smile sadly down at her from his fortress of conviction. “How can it be for my sake,” he would ask,

“when the very thought of it makes my stomach turn over?

Just think a little, April. Please.”

His main tactical problem, in this initial phase of the campaign, was to find ways of making his position attractive, as well as commendable. The visits to town and country restaurants were helpful in this connection; she had only to glance around her in such places to discover a world of handsome, graceful, unquestionably worthwhile men and women who had somehow managed to transcend their environment—people who had turned dull jobs to their own advantage, who had exploited the system without knuckling under to it, who would certainly tend, if they knew the facts of the Wheelers’ case, to agree with him.

“All right,” she would say after hearing him out. “Supposing all this does happen. Supposing a couple of years from now we’re both terribly sleek and stimulated and all that, and we have loads of fascinating friends and long vacations in Europe every summer. Do you really think you’d be any happier? Wouldn’t you still be wasting the prime of your manhood in a completely empty, meaningless kind of—”

And so she would play straight into his snare:

“Suppose we let that be my business.” How much, he would ask her, would his prime of manhood be worth if it had to be made conditional on allowing her to commit a criminal mutilation of herself? “Because that’s what you’d be doing, April; there’s no getting around it. You’d be committing a crime against your own substance. And mine.”

Sometimes, gently, she would charge him with overdra-matizing the whole thing. It was a thing women did every day in perfect safety; the girl at school had done it twice at least. Oh, doing it after the third month would be a different story, she granted him that—“I mean it certainly would be legitimate to worry, if that were the case. This way, though, being able to time it so closely and everything, it’s the safest thing in the world.”

But at her every mention of how safe it was he would puff out his cheeks and blow, frowning and shaking his head, as if he’d been asked to agree that an ethical justification could be found for genocide. No. He wouldn’t buy it.

Soon there began to be a slight embarrassed hesitation in her voice and a distinct averting of her eyes whenever she spoke of the abortion as “doing this thing,” even in the con-text of a heartfelt statement on how absolutely essential it was that the thing be done, as if the presence of his loving, troubled face had put the matter beyond the limits of conversational decency. Soon too—and this was the most encouraging sign of all—he began to be aware at odd moments that she was covertly watching him through a mist of romantic admiration.

These moments were not always quite spontaneous; as often as not they followed a subtle effort of vanity on his part, a form of masculine flirtation that was as skillful as any girl’s. Walking toward or away from her across a restaurant floor, for example, he remembered always to do it in the old

“terrifically sexy” way, and when they walked together he fell into another old habit of holding his head unnaturally erect and carrying his inside shoulder an inch or two higher than the other, to give himself more loftiness from where she clung at his arm. When he lit a cigarette in the dark he was careful to arrange his features in a virile frown before striking and cupping the flame (he knew, from having practiced this at the mirror of a blacked-out bathroom years ago, that it made a swift, intensely dramatic portrait), and he paid scrupulous attention to endless details: keeping his voice low and resonant, keeping his hair brushed and his bitten fingernails out of sight; being always the first one athletically up and out of bed in the morning, so that she might never see his face lying swollen and helpless in sleep.

Sometimes after a particularly conscious display of this kind, as when he found he had made all his molars ache by holding them clamped too long for an effect of grim-jawed determination by candlelight, he would feel a certain distaste with himself for having to resort to such methods—

and, very obscurely, with her as well, for being so easily swayed by them. What kind of kid stuff was this? But these attacks of conscience were quickly allayed: all was fair in love and war; and besides, wasn’t she all too capable of playing the same game? Hadn’t she pulled out everything in her own bag of tricks last month, to seduce him into the Europe plan? All right, then. Maybe it was sort of ludicrous; maybe it wasn’t the healthiest way for grown people to behave, but that was a question they could take up later. There was too much at stake to worry about such things now.

And so he freed himself to concentrate on the refine-ments of his role. He was particularly careful never to mention his day at the office or confess to being tired after the train, he assumed a quiet, almost Continental air of mastery in dealing with waiters and gas station attendants, he salted his after-theater critiques with obscure literary references—

all to demonstrate that a man condemned to a life at Knox could still be interesting (“You’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met”); he enthusiastically romped with the children, disdainfully mowed the lawn in record time and once spent the whole of a midnight’s drive in an impersonation of Eddie Cantor singing “That’s the Kind of a Baby for Me” because it made her laugh—all to demonstrate that a man confronted with this bleakest and most unnatural of conjugal problems, a wife unwilling to bear his child, could still be nice (“I love you when you’re nice”).

His campaign might have been quickly and easily won if he could have arranged for all the hours of the four weeks to be lived at the same pitch of intensity; the trouble was that ordinary life still had to go on.

It was still necessary for him to kill most of each day at the office, where Jack Ordway kept congratulating him on the niftiness of his flying the coop, and for her to spend it imprisoned in the reality of their home.

It was also necessary to deal with Mrs. Givings, who lately had found one excuse after another for calling up and dropping in. Her ostensible purpose was business, which in itself was very trying—there were many details to discuss about putting the house on the market, to which the Wheelers had to listen poker-faced—but her talk kept coming back to John and to “the lovely time we all had that day.” Almost before they knew it, they had agreed to a tentative program of future Sunday afternoons “whenever it’s convenient, whatever Sundays you’re not too busy, between now and the time you leave.”

It was necessary to deal with the Campbells, too. One whole Saturday was consumed that way, a picnic and outing at the beach undertaken at the Campbells’ insistence—a day of hot dogs and children’s tears, of sand and sweat and dazzling confusion—and it left them on the brink of hysteria that night. It was that night, in fact, that the courtship, or the sales campaign, or whatever it was, passed abruptly into its second, nonromantic phase.

“God, what a day,” April said as soon as she’d shut the children’s door, and then she began to move stiffly around the living room in a way that always meant trouble. He had learned early in the courtship, or the campaign, that this room was the worst possible place for getting his points across. All the objects revealed in the merciless stare of its hundred-watt light bulbs seemed to support her argument; and more than once, on hot nights like this, their cumulative effect had threatened to topple the whole intricate structure of his advantage: the furniture that had never settled down and never would, the shelves on shelves of unread or half-read or read-and-forgotten books that had always been supposed to make such a difference and never had; the loathsome, gloating maw of the television set; the forlorn, grubby little heap of toys that might have been steeped in ammonia, so quick was their power to attack the eyes and throat with an acrid pain of guilt and self-reproach (“But I don’t think we were ever meant to be parents. We’re not even adequate as parents . . .”).

Tonight her forehead, cheekbones and nose were sorely pink with sunburn, and the fact that she’d worn sunglasses all day gave her eyes a white, astonished look. Her hair hung in disorderly strings—she kept having to push out her lower lip to blow it away from her eyes—and her body looked uncomfortable too. She was wearing a damp blouse and a pair of wrinkled blue shorts that were just beginning to be tight across the abdomen. She hated to wear shorts anyway because they called attention to how heavy and soft and vein-shot her thighs had grown in the past few years, though Frank had often told her not to he silly about it (“They’re lovely; I like them even better this way; they’re a woman’s legs now”), and now she seemed almost to be parading them in a kind of spite. All right, look at them, she seemed to be saying. Are they “womanly” enough for you?

Is this what you want?

He couldn’t, at any rate, take his eyes off them as they ponderously lifted and settled in her walk around the room.

He made himself a powerful drink and stood sipping it near the kitchen door, bracing himself.

After a while she sat heavily on the sofa and began a lethargic picking-over of old magazines. Then she dropped them and lay back, setting her sneakered feet on the coffee table, and said, “You really are a much more moral person than I am, Frank. I suppose that’s why I admire you.” But she didn’t look or sound admiring.

He tried to dismiss it with a careful shrug as he took a seat across from her. “I don’t know about that. I don’t see what any of this has to do with being ‘moral.’ I mean— you know, not in any sense of conventional morality.”

She seemed to think this over for a long time as she lay back allowing one knee to sway from side to side, rocking it on the swivel of her ankle. Then: “Is there any other kind?”

she asked. “Don’t ‘moral’ and ‘conventional’ really mean the same thing?”

He could have hit her in the face. Of all the insinuating, treacherous little—Christ! And in any other month of his married life he would have been on his feet and shouting:

“Christ, when are you going to get over this damn Noël Coward, nineteen-twenties way of denigrating every halfway decent human value with some cute, brittle, snobbish little thing to say? Listen!” he would have raged at her.

“Listen! Maybe that’s the way your parents lived; maybe that’s the kind of chic, titillating crap you were raised on, but it’s about time you figured out it doesn’t have a God damned thing to do with the real world.” It was his knowledge of the calendar that stopped his mouth. There were twelve days to go. He couldn’t afford to take any chances now, and so instead of shouting those things he held his jaws shut and stared at his glass, which he gripped until it nearly spilled with trembling. Without even trying, he had given his most memorable facial performance to date.

When the spasm was over he said, very quietly:

“Baby, I know you’re tired. We shouldn’t be talking about it now. I know you know better than that. Let’s skip it.”

“Skip what? You know I know better than what?”

“You know. This business about ‘moral’ and ‘conventional.’ ”

“But I don’t know the difference.” She had come earnestly forward on the sofa, had drawn her sneakers back under it and was leaning toward him with both tense forearms on her knees. Her face was so innocently confused that he couldn’t look at it. “Don’t you see, Frank? I really don’t know the difference. Other people seem to; you do; I just don’t, that’s all, and I don’t think I ever really have.”

“Look,” he said. “First place, ‘moral’ was your word, not mine. I don’t think I’ve ever held any brief for this thing on moral grounds, conventional or otherwise. I’ve simply said that under these particular circumstances, it seems pretty obvious that the only mature thing to do is go ahead and have the—”

“But there we are again,” she said. “You see? I don’t know what ‘mature’ means, either, and you could talk all night and I still wouldn’t know. It’s all just words to me, Frank. I watch you talking and I think: Isn’t that amazing?

He really does think that way; these words really do mean something to him. Sometimes it seems I’ve been watching people talk and thinking that all my life”—her voice was becoming unsteady—“and maybe it means there’s something awful the matter with me, but it’s true. Oh no, stay there. Please don’t come and kiss me or anything, or we’ll just end up in a big steaming heap and we won’t get anything settled. Please stay sitting there, and let’s just sort of try to talk. Okay?”

“Okay.” And he stayed sitting there. But trying to talk was something else again; all they could do was look at each other, heavy and weak and bright-eyed in the heat.

“All I know,” she said at last, “is what I feel, and I know what I feel I’ve got to do.”

He got up and turned off all the lights, murmuring

“Cool the place off a little,” but the darkness didn’t help.

This was deadlock. If everything he said was “just words,”



what was the point of talking? How could any possibility of speech prevail against the weight of a stubbornness as deep as this?

But before long his voice had started to work again; almost independent of his will, it had fallen back and begun to employ his final tactic, the dangerous last-ditch maneuver he had hoped to hold in reserve against the possibility of defeat. It was reckless—there were still twelve days to go—but once he had started he couldn’t stop.

“Look,” he was saying, “this may sound as if I think there is something ‘awful’ the matter with you; the fact is I don’t.

I do think, though, that there’s one or two aspects to this thing we haven’t really touched on yet, and I think we ought to. For instance, I wonder if your real motives here are quite as simple as you think. I mean isn’t it possible there are forces at work here that you’re not entirely aware of? That you’re not recognizing?”

She didn’t answer, and in the darkness he could only guess at whether she was listening or not. He took a deep breath. “I mean things that have nothing to do with Europe,” he said, “or with me. I mean things within yourself, things that have their origin in your own childhood—

your own upbringing and so on. Emotional things.”

There was a long silence before she said, in a pointedly neutral tone: “You mean I’m emotionally disturbed.”

“I didn’t say that!” But in the next hour, as his voice went on and on, he managed to say it several times in several different ways. Wasn’t it likely, after all, that a girl who’d known nothing but parental rejection from the time of her birth might develop an abiding reluctance to bear children?

“I mean it’s always been a wonder to me that you could survive a childhood like that,” he said at one point, “let alone come out of it without any damage to your—you know, your ego and everything.” She herself, he reminded her, had suggested the presence of something “neurotic” in her wish to abort the first pregnancy, on Bethune Street—

and all right, all right, of course the circumstances were different this time. But wasn’t it just possible that something of the same confusion might still exist in her attitude? Oh, he wasn’t saying this was the whole story—“I’m not qualified to say that”—but he did feel it was a line of reasoning that ought to be very carefully explored.

“But I’ve had two children,” she said. “Doesn’t that count in my favor?”

He let these words reverberate in the darkness for a while. “The very fact that you put it that way is kind of significant,” he said quietly, “don’t you think? As if having children were a kind of punishment? As if having two of them could ‘count in your favor’ as a credit against any obligation to have another? And the way you said it, too—all defensive, all ready to fight. Jesus, April, if you want to talk that way I can come right back at you with another statistic: you’ve had three pregnancies and you’ve wanted to abort two of them. What kind of a record is that? Oh, look.” He made his voice very gentle, as if he were talking to Jennifer.

“Look, baby. All I’m trying to suggest is that you don’t seem to be entirely rational about this thing. I just wish you’d think about it a little, that’s all.”

“All right,” her voice said bleakly. “All right, suppose all this is true. Suppose I’m acting out a compulsive behavior pattern, or whatever they call it. So what? I still can’t help what I feel, can I? I mean what’re we supposed to do about it? How am I supposed to get over it? Am I just supposed to Face Up to my Problems and start being a different person tomorrow morning, or what?”



“Oh, baby,” he said. “It’s so simple. I mean assuming you are in some kind of emotional difficulty, assuming there is a problem of this sort, don’t you see there is something we can do about it? Something very logical and sensible that we ought to do about it?” He was weary of the sound of his own voice; he felt he had been talking for years. He licked his lips, which tasted as foreign as the flesh of a dentist’s finger in his mouth (“Open wide, now!”), and then he said it.

“We ought to have you see a psychoanalyst.”

He couldn’t see her, but he could guess that her mouth was flattening out and drawing a little to one side, her tough look. “And is Bart Pollock’s job going to pay for that too?” she asked.

He issued a sigh. “You see what you’re doing, when you say a thing like that? You’re fighting with me.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Yes you are. And what’s worse, you’re fighting with yourself. This is exactly the kind of thing we’ve both been doing for years, and it’s about time we grew up enough to cut it out. I don’t know if Pollock’s job is going to pay for it; frankly, I couldn’t care less whose job pays for what. We’re two supposedly adult human beings, and if one or the other of us needs this kind of help we ought to be able to talk it over in an adult way. The question of how it’s going to be

‘paid for’ is the very least important part of it. If it’s needed, it’ll be paid for. I promise you.”

“How nice,” It was only by a dim shifting of shadows and a rustling of upholstery that he could tell she was standing up. “Could we sort of stop talking about it now? I’m dead tired.”

As he listened to her receding footsteps down the hall, and then to the sounds of her brief preparations for bed, and then to the silence, he finished his drink with a foretaste of defeat. He felt that he had played his last chance, and had almost certainly lost.

But the next day brought fresh reserves of strength to his position from an unexpected source: it was the Sunday of John Givings’s second visit.

“Hi!” he called, getting out of the car, and from the moment he ambled pigeon-toed across the driveway with his parents twitching and apologizing around him, it was clear that this would be a different and more difficult afternoon than the last. There would be no strolling companion-ship today, no fond remembrance of radio shows; he was in a highly agitated state. The sight and the sound of him was so unnerving, at first, that it was some time before Frank began to see how this visit might have a certain beneficial, cautionary effect. Here, after all, was a full-fledged mental case for April to observe and contemplate. Could she still say, after this, that she didn’t care if she was crazy too?

“How soon you people taking off?” he demanded, interrupting his mother in the midst of a rapturous sentence about the magnificence of the day. They were sitting out on the back lawn, where April was serving iced tea—or rather, everyone but John was sitting. He was up and walking around, occasionally pausing to stare with narrowed eyes at some point far away in the woods or past the house and down across the road; he looked as if he were turning over grave and secret issues in his mind. “September, did you say? I don’t remember.”

“It isn’t really definite yet,” Frank said.

“You’ll be around another month or so, though, anyway; right? Because the thing is, I need to ask somebody for a—”

He broke off and glanced around the lawn with a puzzled look. “Hey, by the way, where do you people keep your kids? Old Helen keeps telling me about your kids, and I never see ’em. They go to birthday parties every Sunday, or what?”

“They’re visiting friends this afternoon,” April said.

John Givings looked at her steadily and long, and then at Frank; then he lowered his eyes, squatted, and began to pull blades of grass out of the lawn, “Well, that figures,” he said.

“I had a paranoid schizophrenic coming to my house, I’d probably get the kids out of the way too. If I had any kids, that is. If I had any house.”

“Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April,” Mrs.

Givings said. “You must tell me how you fix it.”

“Save it, Ma, okay? She can tell you later. Listen, though, Wheeler. This is important. The thing is, I need to ask somebody for a favor, and as long as you’re going to be around for a month I figure I’d like it to be you. Shouldn’t take much of your time, and it won’t take any of your money. I wonder if you could get me a lawyer.”

Howard Givings cleared his throat. “John, don’t let’s get started again about the lawyer. Steady down, now.”

The look on John’s face now was that of reasonable patience tried to the breaking point. “Pop,” he said,

“couldn’t you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in? Turn off your hearing aid or something. Come on,” he said to Frank. “I guess we’d better make this a private talk. Oh, and bring your wife too.”

And with an air of tense conspiracy he led them both away to a far corner of the yard. “There isn’t any reason why they shouldn’t hear this,” he explained; “it’s just that they’d keep interrupting all the time. Here’s the deal. I want to find out if inmates of mental hospitals have any legal rights. You suppose you could find that out for me?”



“Well,” Frank said, “offhand, I’m afraid I don’t know how I’d—”

“Okay, okay, forget that part of it. In order to find that out you’d probably have to spend money. All I’m asking you to spend is time. Get me the name and address of a good lawyer, and I’ll take it from there. The thing is, you see, I’ve got a good many questions to ask, and I’m willing to pay for the answers. I think I’ve got a pretty good case, if we can get around this business of the legal rights . . .”

It might have been only that his gaze kept switching back and forth between the Wheelers’ faces, with intermittent glances over their shoulders to check on what his parents were doing across the lawn—it might have been only that, in combination with the pallor and dryness of his lips and the fact that his hair stood up and out from his scalp in stiff bristles (he hadn’t worn his cap today), but as his monologue in the sun progressed he began to look more and more like the picture of a racked, wild-eyed madman.

“. . . Now, I don’t need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that’s obvious. If he hits her with it and kills her, that’s a criminal case. If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that’s a civil case. All right. Either way the man’s in a weak position, but here’s the point: in neither case is there any question of his own legal rights being jeopardized. Now, supposing the second of these two possibilities takes place. The guy doesn’t hit her, does break the coffee table, does give her the aggravation—but the woman, the mother, doesn’t exercise her option to take it to court. Supposing what she does instead is to call out the State Troopers. Supposing when she gets hold of the State Troopers she— Pop! ”



At this apparently meaningless shout he began backing away from them like a cornered fugitive, his face distorted in a mixture of menace and fear; when Frank turned around he saw the reason for this outburst was the slow approach of Howard Givings across the grass.

“Pop! I told you not to interrupt me, didn’t I? Didn’t I? I mean it now, Pop. Don’t interrupt me when I’m talking. ”

“Steady down, boy,” Howard Givings said. “Let’s steady down, now. It’s time to go.”

“I mean it, Pop—” He had backed himself up against the stone wall; he was looking desperately around as if for a weapon, and for a second Frank was afraid he might pick a rock out of the wall and throw it; but Howard Givings continued his steady, mollifying advance. He had only to touch his son softly on the elbow to restore a kind of order: John continued to shout, but he was more like a child in a tantrum now than a maniac. “Don’t inter rupt me, that’s all. You got something to say, you can save it till I finish talk ing.”

“All right, John,” Howard Givings murmured, turning and leading him away for a quieting stroll along the edge of the lawn. “All right, now, boy.”

“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Givings said. “I’m terribly sorry about this. It’s his nerves, you see.” She was looking up at the Wheelers in an agony of embarrassment, unable to decide what to do with the egg salad sandwich in her hand. “I’m afraid you’ll have to—excuse us. We shouldn’t have come today.”

“Lord,” April said, washing out the iced-tea glasses when the visitors had gone. “I wonder what his childhood was like.”



“Couldn’t have been very great, I guess, with a pair of parents like that.”

She didn’t say anything until she had finished at the sink and hung up the dish towel. Then: “But at least he had a pair of parents, so at the very least he must have had more emotional security than me. Is that what you’re saying?”

“What I’m saying? Jesus, take it easy, will you?”

But she had already gone, banging the screen door behind her, to retrieve the children from the Campbells’

house. She seemed calm and aloof through the rest of the evening, moving efficiently through the tasks of the dinner and the children’s bedtime, and Frank was careful to keep out of her way. It began to appear that this was to be one of their silent nights, one of the times when they would read the papers in different parts of the room like two discreet, courteous strangers in a hotel lobby; but at ten o’clock, without warning, she broke the truce.

“Sort of a denial of womanhood,” she said. “Is that how you’d put it?”

“Is that how I’d put what? What’re you talking about?”

She looked faintly annoyed, as if impatient with him for having failed to follow the thread of a continuous discussion. “You know. The psychological thing behind this abortion business. Is that what women are supposed to be expressing when they don’t want to have children? That they’re not really women, or don’t want to be women, or something?”

“Baby, I don’t know,” he said kindly, while his heart thickened in gratitude. “Believe me, it’s a thing about which your guess is as good as mine. It does sound sort of logical, though, doesn’t it? I do remember reading somewhere—

oh, in Freud or Krafft-Ebing or one of those people; this was back in college—I do remember reading something about a woman with a sort of infantile penis-envy thing that carried over into her adult life; I guess this is supposed to be fairly common among women; I don’t know. Anyway, she kept trying to get rid of her pregnancies, and what this particular guy figured out was that she was really trying to sort of open herself up so that the—you know—so that the penis could come out and hang down where it belonged.

I’m not sure if I have that right; I read it a long time ago, but that was the general idea.” He wasn’t, in fact, quite sure if he’d read it at all (though where could it have come from if he hadn’t?), and he was not at all sure it had been a wise thing to relate at this particular time.

But she seemed able to absorb the information with no particular surprise. She was looking off into space with her chin in her two cupped hands and both elbows on her knees. She looked perplexed; that was all.

“In any case,” he went on, “I’m sure it’s probably a mistake to try and draw your own conclusions from the things you read in books. Who knows?” He decided he ought to stop there and let her talk for a while, but she didn’t say anything, and the silence seemed to demand to be filled.

“I think we can assume, though,” he said, “just on the basis of common sense, that if most little girls do have this thing about wanting to be boys, they probably get over it in time by observing and admiring and wanting to emulate their mothers—I mean you know, attract a man, establish a home, have children and so on. And in your case, you see, that whole side of life, that whole dimension of experience was denied you from the start. I don’t know; all these things are very obscure and hard to—hard to get hold of, I guess.”

She got up and walked away to stand near the bookcase, with her back to him, and he was reminded of the way he had first seen her, long ago, across that roomful of forgotten talkers in Morningside Heights—a tall, proud, exceptionally first-rate girl.

“How do you suppose we’d go about finding one?” she asked. “A psychiatrist, I mean. Aren’t a lot of them supposed to be quacks? Well, but still, I guess that isn’t really much of a problem, is it.”

He held his breath.

“Okay,” she said. Her eyes were bright with tears as she turned around. “I guess you’re right. I guess there isn’t much more to say, then, is there?”

He knew, as he lay awake between fitful spells of sleep beside her, later in the night, that the campaign was by no means over. There were still eleven days before the deadline, in any one of which she might violently change her mind. For eleven more days, whenever he was with her, he would have to keep all the forces of his argument marshaled and ready for instant, skillful use.

His job now was to consolidate this delicate victory in as many ways as possible, to hold the line. It would be best, he decided, to lose no time in letting everyone know about their change of plans—the Campbells, everyone—so that the whole question of the Wheelers going to Europe could quickly be relegated to the past tense; and meanwhile he must allow no hint of complacency to undermine his position. He would have to be constantly on hand as a source of reassurance until the danger period was over. For a start, he decided he would stay home from work today.
