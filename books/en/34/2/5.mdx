“i’m going to take my dollhouse,” Jennifer said that Saturday afternoon, “and my doll carriage and my bear and my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and all my books and records, and my drum.”

“That sounds like quite a lot, doesn’t it, sweetie?” April said, frowning over her sewing machine. She had decided to spend the weekend sorting out winter clothes, discarding some things and repairing others, concentrating on the simple, sturdy kind of clothes they would need for Europe.

Jennifer was sitting at her feet, playing aimlessly with torn-out linings and bits of thread.

“Oh, and my tea set too, and my rock collection and all my games, and my scooter.”

“Well, but sweetie, don’t you think that’s quite a lot to take? Aren’t you planning to leave anything behind?”

“No. Maybe I’ll throw my giraffe away; I haven’t quite decided.”

“Your giraffe? No, I wouldn’t do that. We’ll have plenty of room for all the animals and dolls and the other small things. It’s just some of the big things I was worried about—

the dollhouse, for instance, and Mike’s rocking horse. That kind of thing’s very difficult to pack, you see. But you won’t have to throw away the dollhouse; you could give it to Madeline.”

“To keep?”

“Well, of course to keep. That’s better than throwing it away, isn’t it?”

“ ’Kay,” Jennifer said, and then, after a minute: “I know what I’ll do. I’ll give Madeline my dollhouse and my giraffe and my carriage and my bear and my three Easter rabbits and my—”

“Just the big things, I said. Didn’t you understand me? I just finished explaining all that. Why can’t you listen?”

April’s voice was rising and flattening out with exasperation, and then she sighed. “Look. Wouldn’t you rather go outside and play with Michael?”

“No. I don’t feel much like it.”

“Oh. Well, I don’t feel much like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who’s too bored and silly to pay attention, either. So that’s that.”

Frank was glad when their voices stopped. He was on the sofa trying to read the introduction to a book of elementary French, which he’d bought to replace the “Brighter” one, and their talking had kept him going over and over the same paragraph.

But half an hour later, when the only sound in the room for that long had been the faint irregular whir of the sewing machine, he looked up uneasily to find that Jennifer was gone.

“Where’d she go, anyway?” he said.



“Out with Michael, I guess.”

“No she didn’t. I know she didn’t go outside.”

They got up and went together to the children’s room, and there she was, lying down and staring at nothing, with her thumb in her mouth.

April sat on the edge of the bed and laid her palm against Jennifer’s temple, and then, apparently feeling no fever, she began stroking her hair. “What’s the matter, baby?” She made her voice very gentle. “Can you tell Mommy what’s the matter?”

Watching from the doorway, Frank’s eyes grew as round as his daughter’s. He swallowed, and so did she, first removing her thumb from her mouth.

“Nothing,” she said.

April took hold of her hand to prevent the thumb from going back in, and in opening the small fist she discovered that a length of green thread had been wound tightly and many times around her index finger. She began to unwind it. It was so tight that the tip of the finger was plum-colored and the moist skin beneath it was wrinkled and bloodless.

“Is it about moving to France?” April asked, still working on the thread. “Are you feeling sort of bad about that?”

Jennifer didn’t answer until the last of the thread was removed. Then she gave a small, barely discernible nod and wrenched herself awkwardly around so that her head could be buried in her mother’s lap as she started to cry.

“Oh,” April said. “I thought that might be it. Poor old Niffer.” She stroked her shoulder. “Well, listen, baby, you know what? There isn’t anything to feel bad about.”

But it was impossible for Jennifer to stop, now that she’d started. Her sobs grew deeper.

“Remember when we moved out here from the city?”



April asked. “Remember how sad it seemed to be leaving the park and everything? And all your friends at nursery school? And remember what happened? It wasn’t more than about a week before Madeline’s mommy brought her over to meet you, and then you met Doris Donaldson, and the Campbell boys, and pretty soon you started school and met all your other friends, and there wasn’t anything to feel bad about any more. And that’s just the way it’s going to be in France. You’ll see.”

Jennifer raised her congested face and tried to say something, but it took her several seconds to get the words out between the convulsions of her breath. “Are we going to live there a long time?”

“Of course. Don’t you worry about that.”

“Forever and ever?”

“Well,” April said, “maybe not forever and ever, but we’ll certainly live there a good long time. You shouldn’t worry so much, sweetie. I think it’s mostly just from sitting around indoors on such a nice day. Don’t you? Let’s go wash your face, now, and then you run along outside and see what Michael’s doing. Okay?”

When she was gone, Frank took up a slumped, standing position behind his wife at the sewing machine. “Gee,” he said. “That really gave me a turn. Didn’t it you?”

She didn’t look up. “How do you mean?”

“I don’t know. It’s just that this does seem a pretty inconsiderate thing to be doing, when you think about it, from the kids’ point of view. I mean, let’s face it: it’s going to be pretty rough on them.”

“They’ll get over it.”

“Of course they’ll ‘get over it,’ ” he said, trying to make the phrase sound heartless. “We could trip them up and break their arms, and they’d ‘get over’ that too; that’s hardly the point. The point is—”

“Look, Frank.” She had turned to face him with her little flat-lipped smile, her tough look. “Are you suggesting we call the whole thing off?”

“No!” He moved away from her to pace the carpet. “Of course I’m not.” For all his annoyance, he found it good to be up and talking again after his long silence of faulty concentration with the French book on the sofa. “Of course I’m not. Why do you have to start—”

“Because if you’re not, then I really don’t see any point in discussing this. It’s a question of deciding who’s in charge and sticking to it. If the children are to be in charge, then obviously we must do what they think is best, which means staying here until we rot. On the other hand—”

“No! Wait a minute; I never said—”

“You wait a minute, please. On the other hand, if we’re to be in charge—and I really think we ought to be, don’t you?

If only because we’re about a quarter of a century older than they are? Then that means going. As a secondary thing it also means doing all we can to make the transition as easy as possible for them.”

“That’s all I’m saying!” He waved his arms. “What’re you getting all excited about? Make the transition as easy as possible—that’s absolutely all I’m saying.”

“All right. The point is I think we’re doing that, and I think we’ll continue to do it to the best of our ability until they do get over it. In the meantime I’m afraid I don’t see any point in holding our heads and moaning about how miserable they’re going to be, or talking about tripping them up and breaking their arms. Frankly, I think that’s a lot of emotionalistic nonsense and I wish you’d cut it out.”



It was the closest thing to a fight they’d had in weeks; it left them on edge and unnecessarily polite for the rest of the day, and caused them to shy away from each other at bedtime. And in the morning they awoke to the sound of rain and the uncomfortable knowledge that this was the Sunday they had arranged to meet John Givings.

Milly Campbell had volunteered to take the children off their hands for the afternoon, “because I mean you probably won’t want them around when he’s there, will you? In case he turns out to be a real nut or anything?” April had declined; but this morning, as the time of the visit drew near, she had second thoughts about it.

“I think we’ll take you up on that after all, Milly,” she said into the telephone, “if the offer still goes. I guess you were right—it does seem a weird sort of thing to expose them to.” And she drove them to the Campbells’ an hour or two earlier than necessary.

“Gosh,” she said, sitting down with Frank in the scrubbed kitchen when she returned. “This is sort of nervous-making, isn’t it? I wonder what he’ll be like? I don’t think I’ve ever met an insane person before, have you?

A real certified insane person, I mean.”

He poured out two glasses of the very dry sherry he liked on Sunday afternoons. “How much you want to bet,” he said, “that he turns out to be pretty much like all the uncertified insane people we know? Let’s just relax and take him as he comes.”

“Of course. You’re right.” And she favored him with a look that made yesterday’s unpleasantness seem years in the past. “You always do have the right instincts about things like this. You’re really a very generous, understanding person, Frank.”



The rain had stopped but it was still a wet, gray day and good to be indoors. The radio was dimly playing Mozart and a gentle, sherry-scented repose settled over the kitchen.

This was the way he had often wished his marriage could always be—unexcited, companionable, a mutual tenderness touched with romance—and as they sat there quietly talking, waiting for the sight of the Givingses’ station wagon to appear through the dripping trees, he shivered pleasurably once or twice as a man who has been out since before dawn will shiver at the feel of the first faint warmth of sun on his neck. He felt himself at peace; and by the time the car did come, he was ready for it.

Mrs. Givings was the first one out, aiming a blind, brilliant smile toward the house before she turned back to deal with the coats and bundles in the back seat. Howard Givings emerged from the driver’s side, ponderously wiping his misted spectacles, and behind him came a tall, narrow, red-faced young man wearing a cloth cap. It wasn’t the kind of jaunty little back-belted cap that had lately become stylish; it was wide, flat, old-fashioned and cheap, and the rest of his drab costume was equally suggestive of orphanage or prison: shapeless twill work pants and a dark brown button-front sweater that was too small for him. From a distance of fifty feet, if not fifty yards, you could tell he was dressed in items drawn from state institutional clothing supplies.

He didn’t look up at the house or at anything else. Lagging behind his parents, he stood with his feet planted wide apart on the wet gravel, slightly pigeon-toed, and gave himself wholly to the business of lighting a cigarette—tamping it methodically on his thumbnail, inspecting it with a frown, fixing it carefully in his lips, hunching and cupping the match to it, and then taking the first deep pulls as intently as if the smoke of this particular cigarette were all he would ever have or expect of sensual gratification.

Mrs. Givings had time to chatter several whole sentences of greeting and apology, and even her husband was able to get a few words in, before John moved from his cigarette-lighting place in the driveway. When he did, he was very quick: he walked springingly on the balls of his feet. Seen at close range, his face proved to be big and lean, with small eyes and thin lips, and its frown was the look of a man worn down by chronic physical pain.

“April . . . Frank,” he said in reply to his mother’s introduction, almost visibly committing both names to memory.

“Glad to meetcha. Heard a lot aboutcha.” Then his face burst into an astonishing grin. His cheeks drew back in vertical folds, two perfect rows of big, tobacco-stained teeth sprang out between his whitening lips, and his eyes seemed to lose their power of sight. For a few seconds it seemed that his face might be permanently locked in this monstrous parody of a friend-winning, people-influencing smile, but it dwindled as the party moved deferentially into the house.

April explained (too pointedly, Frank thought) that the children were away at a birthday party, and Mrs. Givings began telling of how perfectly frightful the traffic had been on Route Twelve, but her voice trailed off when she found that John had claimed the Wheelers’ whole attention. He was making a slow, stiff-legged circuit of the living room, still wearing his cap, examining everything.

“Not bad,” he said, nodding. “Not bad. Very adequate little house you got here.”

“Won’t you all sit down?” April asked, and the elder Givingses obeyed her. John removed his cap and laid it on one of the bookshelves; then he spread his feet and dropped to a squat, sitting on his heels like a farmhand, bouncing a little, reaching down between his knees to flick a cigarette ash neatly into the cuff of his work pants. When he looked up at them now his face was free of tension; he had assumed a kind of pawky, Will Rogers expression that made him look intelligent and humorous.

“Old Helen here’s been talking it up about you people for months,” he told them. “The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, the nice young revolutionaries on Wheeler Road—got so I didn’t know what she was talking about half the time. Course, that’s partly because I didn’t listen. You know how she is? How she talks and talks and talks and never says anything? Kind of get so you quit listening after a while. No, but I got to hand it to her this time; this isn’t what I pictured at all. This is nice. I don’t mean ‘nice’ the way she means ‘nice,’ either; don’t worry. I mean nice. I like it here. Looks like a place where people live.”

“Well,” Frank said. “Thank you.”

“Would anyone like some sherry?” April inquired, twisting her fingers at her waist.

“Oh no, please don’t bother, April,” Mrs. Givings was saying. “We’re fine; please don’t go to any trouble. Actually, we can only stay a min—”

“Ma, how about doing everybody a favor,” John said.

“How about shutting up a little while. Yes, I’d like some sherry, thanks. Bring some for the folks too, and I’ll drink Helen’s if she doesn’t beat me to it. Oh, hey, listen, though.” All the wit vanished from his face as he leaned forward in his squat and extended one gesturing hand toward April like a baseball coach wagging instructions to the infield. “You got a highball glass? Well, look. Take a highball glass, put a couple-three ice cubes in it, and pour the sherry up to the brim. That’s the way I like it.”

Mrs. Givings, sitting tense as a coiled snake on the edge of the sofa, gently closed her eyes and wanted to die. Sherry in a highball glass! His cap on the bookshelf—oh, and those clothes. Week after week she brought him clothes of his own to wear—good shirts and trousers, his fine old tweed jacket with the leather elbows, his cashmere sweater—and still he insisted on dressing up in these hospital things. He did it for spite. And this dreadful rudeness! And why was Howard always, always so useless at times like this? Sitting there smiling and blinking in the corner like an old—oh God, why didn’t he help? “Oh, this is lovely, April, thanks so much,” she said, tremulously lifting a sherry glass from the tray. “Oh, and look at this magnificent food!” She drew back in mock disbelief at the platter of small, crustless sandwiches that April had made and cut that morning. “You really shouldn’t have gone to all this bother for us.” John Givings took two sips of his drink and left it standing on the bookcase for the rest of the visit. But he ate half the plate of sandwiches as he restlessly patrolled the room, taking three or four at a time and wolfing them down while breathing audibly through his nose. Mrs. Givings managed to hold the floor for a few minutes, talking steadily, making such smooth elisions between one sentence and the next as to leave no opening for interruption. She was trying to fili-buster the afternoon away. Had the Wheelers heard the latest ruling of the zoning board? Personally she considered it an outrage; still, she supposed it would ultimately bring the tax rate down, and that was always a blessing . . .

Howard Givings, sleepily nibbling a sandwich, kept a watchful eye on his son’s every action during this monologue; he might have been a benign old nursemaid in the park, making sure the youngster stayed out of mischief.

John watched his mother, head cocked to one side, and when he had swallowed his last mouthful he cut her off in mid-sentence.

“You a lawyer, Frank?”

“Me? A lawyer? No. Why?”

“Hoping you might be, is all. I could use a lawyer.

Whaddya do, then? Advertising man, or what?”

“No. I work for Knox Business Machines.”

“Whaddya do there? You design the machines, or make them, or sell them, or repair them, or what?”

“Sort of help sell them, I guess. I don’t really have much to do with the machines themselves; I work in the office.

Actually it’s sort of a stupid job. I mean there’s nothing—

you know, interesting about it, or anything.”

“ ‘ Interesting’?” John Givings seemed offended by the word. “You worry about whether a job is ‘interesting’ or not? I thought only women did that. Women and boys.

Didn’t have you figured that way.”

“Oh, look, the sun’s coming out!” Mrs. Givings cried. She jumped up, went to the picture window and peered through it, her back very rigid. “Maybe we’ll see a rainbow.

Wouldn’t that be lovely?”

The skin at the back of Frank’s neck was prickling with annoyance. “All I meant,” he explained, “is that I don’t like the job and never have.”

“Whaddya do it for, then? Oh, okay, okay—” John Givings ducked his head and weakly raised one hand as if in a hopeless attempt to ward off the bludgeon of public chas-tisement. “Okay; I know; it’s none of my business. This is what old Helen calls Being Tactless, Dear. That’s my trouble, you see; always has been. Forget I said it. You want to play house, you got to have a job. You want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don’t like. Great. This is the way ninety-eight-point-nine per cent of the people work things out, so believe me buddy you’ve got nothing to apologize for. Anybody comes along and says ‘Whaddya do it for?’ you can be pretty sure he’s on a four-hour pass from the State funny-farm; all agreed. Are we all agreed there, Helen?”

“Oh look, there is a rainbow,” Mrs. Givings said, “—or no, wait, I guess it isn’t—oh, but it’s perfectly lovely in the sunshine. Why don’t we all take a walk?”

“As a matter of fact,” Frank said, “you’ve pretty well put your finger on it, John. I agree with everything you said just now. We both do. That’s why I’m quitting the job in the fall and that’s why we’re taking off.”

John Givings looked incredulously from Frank to April and back again. “Yeah? Taking off where? Oh, hey, yeah, wait a minute—she did say something about that. You’re going to Europe, right? Yeah, I remember. She didn’t say why, though; she just said it was ‘very strange.’ ” And all at once he split the air—very nearly split the house, it seemed—with a bray of laughter. “Hey, how about that, Ma? Still seem ‘very strange’ to you? Huh?”

“Steady down, now,” Howard Givings said gently from his corner. “Steady down, son.”

But John ignored him.

“Boy!” he shouted. “Boy, I bet this whole conversation seems very, very strange to you, huh, Ma?”

They had grown so used to the bright, chirping sound of Mrs. Givings’s voice that day that her next words came as a shock, addressed to the picture window and spoken in a wretchedly tight, moist whimper: “Oh John, please stop.”

Howard Givings got up and shuffled across the room to her. One of his white, liver-spotted hands made a motion as if to touch her, but he seemed to think better of it and the hand dropped again. They stood close together, looking out the window; it was hard to tell whether they were whispering together or not. Watching them, John’s face was still ebullient with the remnants of his laughter.

“Look,” Frank said uneasily, “maybe we ought to take a walk or something.” And April said, “Yes, let’s.”

“Tell you what,” John Givings said. “Why don’t the three of us take a walk, and the folks can stay here and wait for their rainbow. Ease the old tension all around.”

He loped across the carpet to retrieve his cap, and on the way back he veered sharply with an almost spastic movement to the place where his parents stood, his right fist describing a wide, rapid arc toward his mother’s shoulder.

Howard Givings saw it coming and his glasses flashed in fright for an instant, but there was no time to interfere before the fist landed—not in a blow but in a pulled-back, soft, affectionate cuffing against the cloth of her dress.

“See you later, then, Ma,” he said. “Stay as sweet as you are.”

Up in the woods behind the house, steaming in the sun, the newly rainwashed earth gave off an invigorating fragrance. The Wheelers and their guest, relaxing in an unexpected sense of cameraderie, had to walk single file on the hill and pick their way carefully among the trees; the slightest nudge of an overhanging branch brought down a shower of raindrops, and the glistening bark of passing twigs was apt to leave grainy black smears on their clothing.



After a while they quit the woods and walked slowly around the back yard. The men did most of the talking; April listened, staying close to Frank’s arm, and more than once he noticed, glancing down at her, that her eyes were bright with what looked like admiration for the things he was saying.

The practical side of the Europe plan didn’t seem to interest John Givings, but he was full of persistent questions about their reasons for going; and once, when Frank said something about “the hopeless emptiness of everything in this country,” he came to a stop on the grass and looked thunderstruck.

“Wow,” he said. “Now you’ve said it. The hopeless emptiness. Hell, plenty of people are on to the emptiness part; out where I used to work, on the Coast, that’s all we ever talked about. We’d sit around talking about emptiness all night. Nobody ever said ‘hopeless,’ though; that’s where we’d chicken out. Because maybe it does take a certain amount of guts to see the emptiness, but it takes a whole hell of a lot more to see the hopelessness. And I guess when you do see the hopelessness, that’s when there’s nothing to do but take off. If you can.”

“Maybe so,” Frank said. But he was beginning to feel uncomfortable again; it was time to change the subject. “I hear you’re a mathematician.”

“You hear wrong. Taught it for a while, that’s all. Anyway, it’s all gone now. You know what electrical shock treatments are? Because you see, the past couple months I’ve had thirty-five—or no, wait—thirty-seven—” He squinted at the sky with a vacant look, trying to remember the number. In the sunlight, Frank noticed for the first time that the creases in his cheeks were really the scars of a surgeon’s lancet, and that other areas of his face were blotched and tough with scar tissue. At one time in his life his face had probably been a mass of boils or cists. “—thirty-seven electrical shock treatments. The idea is to jolt all the emotional problems out of your mind, you see, but in my case they had a different effect. Jolted out all the God damned mathematics. Whole subject’s a total blank.”

“How awful,” April said.

“ ‘ How awful.’ ” John Givings mimicked her in a mincing, effeminate voice and then turned on her with a challenging smirk. “Why?” he demanded. “Because mathematics is so

‘interesting’?”

“No,” she said. “Because the shocks must be awful and because it’s awful for anybody to forget something they want to remember. As a matter of fact I think mathematics must be very dull.”

He stared at her for a long time, and nodded with approval. “I like your girl, Wheeler,” he announced at last.

“I get the feeling she’s female. You know what the difference between female and feminine is? Huh? Well, here’s a hint: a feminine woman never laughs out loud and always shaves her armpits. Old Helen in there is feminine as hell.

I’ve only met about half a dozen females in my life, and I think you got one of them here. Course, come to think of it, that figures. I get the feeling you’re male. There aren’t too many males around, either.”

Mrs. Givings, covertly watching them from the house, didn’t quite know what to think. She was still shaken—

the beginning of the afternoon had been worse than the worst of her fears—but she had to admit that John had seldom looked happier and more relaxed than he did now, strolling and chatting in the Wheelers’ back yard. And the Wheelers looked comfortable too, which was even more surprising.

“They do seem to—to like him, don’t they?” she said to Howard, who was picking through the Wheelers’ Sunday Times.

“Mm,” he said. “You shouldn’t get so nervous about these things, Helen. Why don’t you just relax when they come back, and let them do the talking?”

“Oh, I know,” she said. “I know, you’re right. That’s what I ought to do.”

And she did, and it worked. For the last hour of the visit, while everyone but John had another glass of wine, she scarcely said a word. She and Howard sat benignly in the background of the young people’s conversation, a peaceful medley of voices in which John’s voice was never once more raucous than the others. They were reminiscing about the children’s radio programs of the nineteen-thirties.

“ ‘ Bobby Benson,’ ” Frank was saying. “Bobby Benson of the H-Bar-O Ranch; I always liked him. I think he came on just before ‘Little Orphan Annie.’ ”

“Oh, and ‘Jack Armstrong,’ of course,” April said, “and

‘The Shadow,’ and that other mystery one—something about a bee? ‘The Green Hornet.”

“No, but ‘The Green Hornet’ was later,” John said.

“That was still going in the forties. I mean the real way-back ones; thirty-five and six, along in there. Remember the one about the naval officer? What was his name? Used to come on right about this time? On week days?”

“Oh yes,” April said. “Wait a minute—‘Don Winslow.’ ”

“Right! ‘Don Winslow of the United States Navy.’ ”

It wasn’t at all the kind of topic Mrs. Givings would have thought they’d discuss, but they all seemed to enjoy it; the sound of their easy, nostalgic laughter filled her with pleasure, and so did the taste of her sherry, and so did the sherry-colored squares of sunset on the wall, each square alive with the nodding shadows of leaves and branches stirred by the wind.

“Oh, this has been such fun,” she said when it was time to go, and for a second she was afraid John might turn on her and say something awful, but he didn’t. He was talking and shaking hands with Frank, and the party broke up in the driveway with a chorus of regrets and good wishes and promises to see each other soon.

“You were wonderful,” April said when the car had disappeared. “The way you handled him! I don’t know what I’d ever have done if you hadn’t been here.”

Frank reached for the sherry bottle, but changed his mind and got out the whiskey instead. He felt he deserved it. “Hell, it wasn’t a question of ‘handling’ him,” he said. “I just treated him like anyone else, is all.”

“But that’s what I mean—that’s what was so wonderful. I would’ve treated him like an animal in the zoo or something, the way Helen does. Wasn’t it funny how much more sane he seemed once we got him away from her? And he’s sort of nice, isn’t he? And intelligent. I thought some of the things he said were sort of brilliant.”

“Mm.”

“He certainly did seem to sort of approve of us, didn’t he? Wasn’t that nice about ‘male’ and ‘female’? And do you know something, Frank? He’s the first person who’s really seemed to know what we’re talking about.”

“That’s true.” He took a deep drink, standing at the picture window and watching the last of the sunset. “I guess that means we’re as crazy as he is.”



She came up close behind him and put her arms around his chest, nestling her head against his shoulder blade. “I don’t care if we are,” she said. “Do you?”

“No.”

But he had begun to feel depressed in a way that couldn’t be attributed to ordinary Sunday-evening sadness. This odd, exhilarating day was over, and now in the fading light he could see that it had only been a momentary respite from the tension that had harried him all week. He could feel the resumption of it now, despite the reassurance of her clinging at his back—a dread, a constricting heaviness of spirit, a foreboding of some imminent, unavoidable loss.

And he was gradually aware that she felt it too: there was a certain stiffness in the way she was holding him, a suggestion of effort to achieve the effect of spontaneity, as though she knew that a nestling of the shoulder blade was in order and was doing her best to meet the specifications. They stood that way for a long time.

“Wish I didn’t have to go to work tomorrow,” he said.

“Don’t, then. Stay home.”

“No. I guess I’ve got to.”
