“fly the coop,” Jack Ordway said, stirring his coffee.

“Kick over the traces. Take off. Pretty nifty, Franklin.”

They were sitting at a ketchup-stained table for two in the dark corner of the Nice place, and Frank was beginning to regret having told Ordway about Europe. A clown, a drunk, a man unable to discuss anything at all except in the elaborately derisive tone he used for talking about himself—wasn’t this the desirable kind of confidant to have in a thing like this? But he’d told him, nevertheless, because in the past few weeks it had become more and more difficult to carry his secret alone through the office day. Sitting attentively in staff conferences while Bandy outlined things to be done “in the fall” or “first of the year,” accepting Sales Promotion assignments that would theoretically take him months to complete, he would sometimes find his mind sliding readily into gear with the slow machinery of Bandy’s projects before it occurred to him to think: No, wait a minute—I won’t even be here then. At first these little shocks had been fun, but the fun of them had worn off and soon they had become distinctly troubling. It was getting on for the middle of June. In another two and a half months (eleven weeks!) he would be crossing the ocean, never to be concerned with Sales Promotion again, yet the reality of that fact had still to penetrate the reality of the office. It was a perfectly, inescapably real fact at home, where nobody talked of anything else; it was real on the train each morning and again on the train each night, but for the eight hours of his working day it remained as insubstantial as a half-remembered, rapidly fading dream. Everyone and everything in the office conspired against it. The stolid or tired or mildly sardonic faces of his colleagues, the sight of his in basket and his current work pile, the sound of his phone or of the buzzer that meant he was wanted in Bandy’s cubicle—all these seemed constantly to tell him he was destined to stay here forever.

The hell I am! he felt like saying twenty times a day. You just wait and see. But his defiance lacked weight. The bright, dry, torpid lake of this place had contained him too long and too peacefully to be ruffled by any silent threat of escape; it was all too willing to wait and see. This was intolerable; the only way to put an end to it was to speak out and tell somebody; and Jack Ordway was, after all, the best friend he had in the office. Today they had managed to avoid Small and Lathrop and Roscoe for lunch, and had started it off with a couple of weak but adequate martinis; and now the story was out.

“There’s one small point I don’t quite grasp, though,”

Ordway was saying. “I don’t mean to be dense, but what exactly will you be doing? I don’t see you languishing indefinitely at sidewalk cafés while your good frau commutes to the embassy or whatever—but that’s the point, you see. I don’t quite know what I do see you doing. Writing a book?

Painting a—”

“Why does everybody think in terms of writing books and painting pictures?” Frank demanded, and then, only partly aware that he was quoting his wife, he said, “My God, are artists and writers the only people entitled to lives of their own? Look. The only reason I’m here in this half-assed job is because—well, I suppose there’s a lot of reasons, but here’s the point. If I started making a list of all the reasons, the one reason I damn sure couldn’t put down is that I like it, because I don’t. And I’ve got this funny feeling that people are better off doing some kind of work they like.”

“Fine!” Ordway insisted. “Fine! Fine! Don’t let’s get all defensive and riled up, please. My only simple-minded question is this: What kind do you like?”

“If I knew that,” Frank said, “I wouldn’t have to be taking a trip to find out.”

Ordway thought this over, tilting his handsome head to one side, lifting his brows and curling out his underlip, which looked unpleasantly pink and slick. “Well, but don’t you think,” he said, “I mean to say, assuming there is a true vocation lurking in wait for you, don’t you think you’d be just as apt to discover it here as there? I mean, isn’t that possible?”

“No. I don’t think it is. I don’t think it’s possible for anybody to discover anything on the fifteenth floor of the Knox Building, and I don’t think you do either.”

“Mm. Must say that sounds like a good point, Franklin.

Yes indeed.” He drank off the last of his coffee and sat back, smiling quizzically across the table. “And when did you say this noble experiment is going to begin?”

For a second Frank wanted to turn the table over on him, to see the helpless fright in his face as his chair went over backwards and the whole mess of dishes went up and over his head. “Noble experiment”! What kind of supercilious crap was that?

“We’re going in September,” he said. “Or October at the outside.”

Ordway nodded five or six times, gazing at the concealed smears of meat and potato on his plate. He didn’t look supercilious now; he looked old and beaten and wistfully envious; and Frank, watching him, felt his own resentment blurring into an affectionate pity. The poor, silly old bastard, he thought. I’ve spoiled his lunch; I’ve spoiled his day.

He almost wished he could say, “It’s all right, Jack, don’t worry; it may never happen”; instead he took refuge from his own confusion in a burst of heartiness.

“Tell you what, Jack,” he said. “I’ll buy you a brandy for old times.”

“No, no, no, no,” Ordway said, but he looked as pleased as a stroked spaniel when the waiter cleared the plates away and set the rich little cognac glasses in their place; and later, when they’d paid their checks and walked upstairs into the sunlight, he was all smiles.

It was a clear, warm day, with a sky as clean and deep as laundry blueing above the buildings, and it was also payday, time for the traditional after-lunch stroll to the bank.

“Needless to say I’ll keep this strictly entre nous, old scout,” Ordway said as they walked. “I don’t suppose you want it noised around. How much notice you planning to give Bandy?”

“Couple of weeks, I guess. Haven’t really thought about it.”

The sun was pleasingly warm. In another few days it would be hot, but it was perfect now. In the cool marble depths of the bank, whose Muzac system was playing “Hol-iday for Strings,” he entertained himself by pretending it was the last time he would ever stand in line here, the last time he would ever shift his feet and finger his paycheck as he and Ordway waited their turns at one of the ten tellers’

windows that were reserved at lunchtime, twice a month, for Knox employees. “You ought to see us shuffling around that damned bank,” he had told April years ago. “We’re like a litter of suckling pigs waiting for a free tit. Oh, of course we’re all very well-mannered, very refined little pigs; we all stand very suavely and try not to jostle each other too much, and when each guy gets up close to the window he takes out his check and sort of folds it in his fingers or palms it or finds some other way of hiding it without seeming to.

Because it’s very important to be casual, you see, but the really important thing is to make damn sure nobody else sees how much you’re getting. Jesus!”

“Gentlemen,” said Vince Lathrop, at Frank’s shoulder.

“Shall we take the air?” He and Ed Small and Sid Roscoe were pocketing their passbooks and their wallets, their tongues still sucking random shreds of Awful place food from the crevices of their teeth, and this was an invitation to join them in a digestive stroll around the block.

He pretended it was the last time he would ever do this, too; the last time he would ever join this slow promenade of office people in the sunshine, the last time the approach of his own polished shoes would ever cause these wobbling pigeons to take fright and skitter away across the spit and peanut shells of the sidewalk, to flap and climb until they were wheeling high over the towers with alternately black and silver wings.



It was better to have told somebody; it had made a difference. He was able to glance around at the talking faces of these four men and feel truly detached from them. Ordway, Lathrop, worried little Ed Small, pretentious, boring old Sid Roscoe—he knew now that he would soon be saying goodbye to all of them and that in another year he’d have trouble remembering their names. In the meantime, and this was the best part, in the meantime it was no longer necessary to dislike them. They weren’t such bad guys. He could even join happily in their laughter at some mild joke of Ordway’s, and when they turned the last corner and headed back to the Knox Building he could take pleasure in the comradely way they spread out five abreast across the sidewalk, inspired by the sun to step out briskly and swing their arms with all the apparent “unit pride” of soldiers from the same platoon on pass (What out fit, Mac? Sales Promotion, Fifteenth Floor, Knox Business Machines).

And Goodbye, goodbye, he could say in his heart to everyone they passed—a chattering knot of stenographers clutching packages from the dimestore, a cynical, heavy-smoking group of young clerks who leaned against a building front in their shirtsleeves—goodbye to the whole sweet, sad bunch of you. I’m leaving.

It was a splendid sense of freedom, and it lasted until he was back at his desk, where the buzzer that meant he was wanted in Bandy’s cubicle was mournfully bleating.

Ted Bandy never looked his best in fine weather; he was an indoor man. His thin gray body, which seemed to have been made for no other purpose than to fill the minimum require-ments of a hard-finish, double-breasted business suit, and his thin gray face were able to relax only in the safety of winter, when the office windows were shut. Once, when he’d been assigned to accompany a group of prize-winning salesmen on a trip to Bermuda, Roscoe’s Knox Knews had carried a photograph of the whole party lined up and grinning on the beach in their swimming trunks; and Roscoe’s secretly made enlargement of one section of that picture, showing Bandy doing his best to smile under the weight of two great, hairy arms that had been flung around his neck from either side, had enjoyed weeks of furtive circulation among the cubicles of the Fifteenth Floor, where everyone pronounced it the funniest damn thing they’d ever seen.

Bandy was wearing something of that same expression now, and at first Frank thought it was only because the June breeze from the window had comically dislodged some of the long side hairs that were supposed to be combed across his baldness. But he discovered with a start, on entering the cubicle, that the main cause of Bandy’s uneasiness was the presence there of a rare and august visitor.

“Frank, you know Bart Pollock, of course,” he said, getting to his feet, and then with an apologetic nod he said,

“Frank Wheeler, Bart.”

A massive figure in tan gabardine rose up before him, a big tan face smiled down, and his right hand was enveloped in a warm clinch. “Don’t guess we’ve ever been formally introduced,” said a voice deep enough to make the glassware tremble on a speaker’s rostrum. “Glad to know you, Frank.”

This man, who in any other corporation would have been called “Mr.” rather than “Bart,” was general sales manager for the Electronics Division, a man from whom Frank had never received anything more than an occasional vague nod in the elevator, and whom he had despised from a distance for years. “I mean he’d be perfect Presidential timber in the worst sense,” he had told April once. “He’s one of these big calm father-image bastards with a million-dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between the ears; put him on television and the other party’d never have a chance.” And now, feeling his own face twitch into a grimace of servility, feeling a drop of sweat creep out of his armpit and run down his ribs, he tried to atone for this uncontrollable reaction by planning how he would describe it to April tonight. “And I suddenly caught myself sort of melting in front of him—isn’t that funny? I mean I know he’s a horse’s ass; I know he’s got nothing to do with anything that matters in my life, and all the same he almost had me cowed. Isn’t that the damnedest thing?”

“Pull up a chair, Frank,” said Ted Bandy, smoothing the hairs back across his head, and when he sat down again he shifted his weight uncomfortably from one buttock to the other, the gesture of a man with hemorrhoids. “Bart and I’ve been going over some of the reports on the NAPE

conference,” he began, “and Bart asked me to call you in on it. It seems . . .”

But Frank couldn’t follow the rest of Bandy’s sentence because all his attention was fixed on Bart Pollock. Leaning earnestly forward in his chair, Pollock waited until Bandy had finished talking; then he rapped the back of his free hand smartly across the paper he was holding, which turned out to be a copy of Speaking of Production Control, and said:

“Frank, this is a crackerjack. They’re just tickled to death in Toledo.”

“And I mean isn’t that the damnedest thing?” he demanded of April that evening, laughing and talking at the same time, following her around the kitchen with a drink in his hand while she got the dinner ready to serve. “I mean isn’t it ironic? I do this dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with Bandy, and this is what happens. You should’ve heard old Pollock go on about it—all these years he hasn’t known I’m alive, and suddenly I’m his favorite bright young man. Old Bandy sitting there trying to decide whether to be pleased or jealous, me sitting there trying to keep from laughing myself to death—Jesus!”

“Marvelous,” she said. “Would you mind carrying these in, darling?”

“And then it turns out he’s got this big—What? Oh, sure, okay.” He put down his glass, took the plates she handed him and followed her into the other room, where the children were already seated at the table. “And then it turns out he’s got this big idea; Pollock, that is. He wants me to do a whole series of the crazy things. Speaking of Inventory Control, Speaking of Sales Analysis, Speaking of Cost Accounting, Speaking of Payroll—he’s got it all mapped out. I’m supposed to go out to—”

“Excuse me a sec, Frank. Michael, you sit up straight, now, or there’s going to be trouble. I mean it. And don’t take such big bites. I’m sorry; go on.”

“I’m supposed to go out to lunch with him next week and talk it over. Won’t that be a riot? Course, if it gets too thick I’ll have to tell him I’m leaving the company in the fall. No, but I mean the whole thing’s pretty funny, isn’t it? After all these—”

“Why not tell him anyway?”

“—years of doping along in the damn job and never—

What?”

“I said why don’t you tell him anyway? Why not tell the whole pack of them? What can they do?”



“Well,” he said, “it’s hardly a question of their ‘doing’

anything; it’d just be—you know, a little awkward, that’s all.

I mean I certainly don’t see the point of saying anything until it’s time to give them my formal notice, that’s all.” He forked a piece of pork chop into his mouth so angrily that he bit the fork as well as the meat, and as he chewed with all the strength of his jaws, exhaling a long breath through his nostrils to show how self-controlled he was, he realized that he didn’t quite know what he was angry about.

“Well,” she said placidly, without looking up. “Of course that’s entirely up to you.”

The trouble, he guessed, was that all the way home this evening he had imagined her saying: “And it probably is the best sales promotion piece they’ve ever seen—what’s so funny about that?”

And himself saying: “No, but you’re missing the point—

a thing like this just proves what a bunch of idiots they are.”

And her: “I don’t think it proves anything of the sort.

Why do you always undervalue yourself? I think it proves you’re the kind of person who can excel at anything when you want to, or when you have to.”

And him: “Well, I don’t know; maybe. It’s just that I don’t want to excel at crap like that.”

And her: “Of course you don’t, and that’s why we’re leaving. But in the meantime, is there anything so terrible about accepting their recognition? Maybe you don’t want it or need it, but that doesn’t make it contemptible, does it? I mean I think you ought to feel good about it, Frank. Really.”

But she hadn’t said anything even faintly like that; she hadn’t even looked as if thoughts like that could enter her head. She was sitting here cutting and chewing in perfect composure, with her mind already far away on other things.
