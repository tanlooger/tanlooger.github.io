there now began a time of such joyous derangement, of such exultant carelessness, that Frank Wheeler could never afterwards remember how long it lasted. It could have been a week or two weeks or more before his life began to come back into focus, with its customary concern for the passage of time and its anxious need to measure and apportion it; and by then, looking back, he was unable to tell how long it had been otherwise. The only day that would always stand clear and sharp in his memory was the first one, the day after his birthday.

He did sleep on the train, riding with his head fallen back on the dusty plush and his Times sliding from his lap; and he stood for a long time over scalding cups of coffee in the echoing tan vault of Grand Central, allowing himself to be late for work. How small and neat and comically serious the other men looked, with their gray-flecked crew cuts and their button-down collars and their brisk little hurrying feet!

There were endless desperate swarms of them, hurrying through the station and the streets, and an hour from now they would all be still. The waiting midtown office buildings would swallow them up and contain them, so that to stand in one tower looking out across the canyon to another would be to inspect a great silent insectarium displaying hundreds of tiny pink men in white shirts, forever shifting papers and frowning into telephones, acting out their pas-sionate little dumb show under the supreme indifference of the rolling spring clouds.

In the meantime, Frank Wheeler’s coffee was delicious, his paper napkin was excellently white and dry, and the grandmotherly woman who served him was so courteous and so clearly pleased with the rhythm of her own efficiency (“Yes, sir, thank you sir; will that be all, sir?”) that he wanted to lean over and press a kiss into her wrinkled cheek. By the time he reached the office he had passed into that euphoria of half-refreshed exhaustion in which all sounds are muffled, all sights are blurred and every task is easy.

First things first: and the first thing he had to do, when the elevator door slid open at the Fifteenth Floor, was to walk up and deal like a man with Maureen Grube. She was alone at her reception desk, in a dark suit that she’d probably worn because it was the most severe, least provocative thing in her wardrobe, and when she saw him coming she looked badly flustered. But his smile was so expert—not the least bit furtive or the least bit vain, a perfectly open, friendly smile—that he could see the assurance come back into her face before he got to the desk. Had she been afraid he would think her a tramp? That he’d spend the day whispering and chuckling about her with the other men? If so, the smile told her she could relax. Had she been afraid, on the other hand, that he would try to make a big romantic thing out of it? That he’d embarrass the life out of her with messy little importunings in corners (“I’ve got to see you . . .”)?

The smile told her she could stop worrying about that, too; and these two possibilities, for the moment, were the only ones that seemed likely enough to bother with.

“Hi,” he said kindly. “You have any trouble about yesterday? With Mrs. Jorgensen, I mean?”

“No. She didn’t say anything.” She seemed to be having some difficulty in meeting his eyes; she was looking mostly at the knot of his tie. Standing there and smiling down at her, with the constant hum and bustle of people milling just out of earshot in the dry lake beyond them, he could easily have been stopping to pass the time of day or to ask her about a typing job; there was nothing in his face or his stance to arouse the curiosity of onlookers. Yet at close range, from where she sat, he knew there could be no doubt of his intimate sincerity.

“Look, Maureen,” he began. “If I thought there was anything to be gained by it, for either of us, I’d say let’s go somewhere this afternoon and have a talk. And if you want to, if there’s anything at all you want to tell me or ask me, that’s what we’ll do. Is there?”

“No. Except that I—well, no. There isn’t really. You’re right.”

“It isn’t a question of being ‘right.’ I don’t want you to think I’m—well, never mind. But listen: the important thing in a thing like this is not to have any regrets. I don’t; I hope you don’t, and if you do I hope you’ll tell me.”

“No,” she said. “I don’t.”

“I’m glad. And listen: You’re swell, Maureen. If there’s ever anything I can—you know, do for you or anything, I hope you’ll let me know. I guess that sounds sort of crummy. All I mean is that I’d like us to be friends.”

“All right,” she said. “So would I.”

And he walked away up the aisle of cubicles, moving slowly and confidently in a new, more mature version of the old “terrifically sexy walk” of Bethune Street. As simple as that! If he’d spent days planning and rehearsing it, filling page after page of scratch paper with revised and crossed-out sentences, he could never have come up with a more dignified, more satisfactory speech. And all on the spur of the moment! Was there anything in the world he couldn’t do?

“Morning, Dad,” he said to Jack Ordway.

“Franklin, my son. How good to see your shining morning face.”

But first things first; and the next thing now was his in basket. No; it was the batch of papers he’d dropped on the middle of his desk yesterday, the things Maureen had pulled from the central file, which brought up the whole disorderly problem of the branch manager in Toledo and the production control brochure. Was he going to let a thing like that harass him? Certainly not.

“Intra-company letter to Toledo,” he said into the mouthpiece of his Dictaphone, leaning back in his swivel chair and working his foot into its wooden saddle on the drawer edge. “Attention B. F. Chalmers, branch manager.

Subject: NAPE conference. Paragraph. With regard to recent and previous correspondence, this is to advise that the matter has been very satisfactorily taken in hand, period, paragraph.”

He went that far without any idea of how the matter was going to be taken in hand, if at all; but as he sat fingering the mouthpiece he began to get ideas, and soon he was intoning one smooth sentence after another, pausing only to smile in satisfaction. The branch manager in Toledo was turning out to be as easy to handle as Maureen Grube.

F. H. Wheeler, or “we,” wholly agreed that the existing brochure was unsuitable. Fortunately, the problem had now been solved in a way which “we” were confident would meet with the branch manager’s approval. As the branch manager doubtless knew, the NAPE delegates would be given dozens of competitive promotion brochures, most of which were certain to end up in the wastebaskets of the convention floor. The problem, then, was to develop something different for Knox—something that would catch the delegate’s eye, that he would want to put in his pocket and take back to his hotel room. Just such a piece was now in production, designed specifically for the NAPE conference: a brief, straightforward sales message entitled “Speaking of Production Control.” As the branch manager would see, this document relied on no slick format, no fancy artwork or advertising jargon to tell its story. Crisply printed in large, easy-to-read type, in black and white, it had all the immediacy of plain talk. It would “give the NAPE delegate nothing more or less than what he wants, colon: the facts.”

After putting a new belt in the Dictaphone machine, he leaned back again and said, “Copy for Veritype. Heading: Speaking of Production Control, dot, dot, dot. Paragraph.

Production control is, comma, after all, comma, nothing more or less than the job of putting the right materials in the right place at the right time, comma, according to a varying schedule. Period, paragraph. This is simple arith-metic, period. Given all the variables, comma, a man can do it with a pencil and paper, period. But the Knox ‘500’ Electronic Computer can do it—dash—literally—dash—

thousands of times faster, period. That’s why . . .”

“Coming down for coffee, Franklin?”

“I guess not, Jack. I better finish this thing.”

And he did finish it, though it took him all morning. Fingering through the papers from the central file with his free hand, lifting a sentence here and a paragraph there, he continued to recite into the Dictaphone until he’d explained all the advantages of using a computer to coordinate the details of factory production. It sounded very authoritative when he played it back (“Once the bill of materials has been exploded,” he heard his own voice saying, “the computer’s next step is to scan the updated parts inventory”). No one could have told that he didn’t quite know what he was talking about. When the typescript came back he would polish it up—maybe he’d have it checked over by one of the technical men, just to be safe—and then he’d have it Verityped and sent to Toledo in the required number of copies. For self-protection he would send one copy to Bandy, with a note saying “Hope this is okay—Toledo wanted something short & sweet for the NAPE thing,” and with luck he’d be off the hook. In the meantime he could safely remove all the troublesome Toledo correspondence from the stack of things he couldn’t bring himself to face just now, and put it in his out basket marked “File,” along with all the brochure material.

This made such a surprising reduction in the clutter of his desk that he was encouraged, after lunch, to tackle two or three other matters in the stack of things he couldn’t face. One of them involved a ticklish letter explaining why

“we” had allowed an obsolete model of adding-machine demonstrator to be shipped to the Chicago Business Fair, and he made it an airtight masterpiece of evasion; another, a thick sheaf of letters that he’d been avoiding for weeks, turned out to be much simpler than he’d thought in that it all boiled down to a decision left squarely up to him. Should solid-gold tie clasps ($14.49) or solid-gold lapel buttons ($8.98) be offered as the prizes in a quota-breaking contest among the tabulating-equipment salesmen of Minneapolis-St. Paul? Tie clasps! And into the out basket it went.

He was a demon of energy; and it wasn’t until four o’clock, walking blearily to the water cooler (“Watch the big bubble come up—Blurp!—Isn’t that funny?”) that he realized why. It was because April had left a small pocket of guilt in his mind last night by saying that he’d “worked like a dog year after year.” He had meant to point out that whatever it was he’d been doing here year after year, it could hardly be called working like a dog—but she hadn’t given him a chance. And now, by trying to clear all the papers off his desk in one day, he guessed he was trying to make up for having misled her. But what kind of nonsense was that?

How could it possibly matter what he’d been doing here year after year, or what she thought he’d been doing, or what he thought she thought he’d been doing? None of it mattered any more; couldn’t he get that through his head?

And as he stumbled back from the water cooler, wiping his cold mouth with a warm hand, he began to understand for the first time that in another few months he would leave this place forever. All of it—lights, glass partitions, chattering typewriters—the whole slow, dry agony of this place would be cut away from his life like a tumor from his brain; and good riddance.

His final act of that day in the office involved no work at all and very little energy, though it did take a certain amount of courage. He opened the big bottom drawer of his desk, carefully lifted out the whole stack of Real Goodies—it weighed as much as a couple of telephone books—and tipped it into the wastebasket.

For an indeterminate number of days after that, the office all but vanished from his consciousness. He went through the motions, shuffling his papers, having conferences with Bandy, having lunch with Ordway and the others, smiling with dignity whenever he passed Maureen Grube in the corridors and even stopping to chat with her now and then, to show that they were friends—but the fact was that the daytime had ceased to have any meaning except as a period of rest and preparation for the evening.

He never seemed to come fully awake until the moment he swung down from the train at sunset and climbed into his station car. Then came the stimulation of drinks with April, while the children lay silenced by television, and then the pleasure of dinner, which in conversational intensity was very like the dinners they’d had before they were married. But the day didn’t really begin until later still, when the children were in bed with their door firmly shut for the night. Then they would take their places in the living room—April curled attractively on the sofa, usually, and Frank standing with his back to the bookcase, each with a cup of black Italian coffee and a cigarette—and give way to their love affair.

He would begin to pace slowly around and around the room as he talked, and she would follow him with her eyes, often with the tilt of her whole head and shoulders. From time to time when he felt he’d made a trenchant point he would wheel and stare at her in triumph; then it would be her turn to talk, while he walked and nodded, and when her turn was over their looks would meet exultantly again.

Sometimes there was a glint of humor in these embraces of the eye: I know I’m showing off, they seemed to say, but so are you, and I love you.

And what did it matter? The very substance of their talk, after all, the message and the rhyme of it, whatever else they might be saying, was that they were going to be new and better people from now on. April, tucked up on the sofa with her skirt arranged in a graceful whirl from waist to ankle, her tall neck very white in the soft light and her face held in perfect composure, bore hardly any resemblance to the stiff, humiliated actress who had stood in the curtain call—and still less to the angrily sweating wife who had hauled the lawnmower, or to the jaded matron who had endured the evening of false friendship with the Campbells, or to the embarrassed, embarrassingly ardent woman who had welcomed him to his birthday party. Her voice was subtle and low, as low as in the first act of The Petrified Forest, and when she tipped back her head to laugh or leaned forward to reach out and tap the ash from her cigarette, she made it a maneuver of classic beauty. Anyone could picture her conquering Europe.

And Frank was modestly aware that something of the same kind of change was taking place in himself. He knew for one thing that he had developed a new way of talking, slower and more deliberate than usual, deeper in tone and more fluent: he almost never had to recourse to the stam-mering, apologetic little bridges (“No, but I mean—I don’t know— you know—”) that normally laced his speech, nor did his head duck and weave in the familiar nervous effort to make himself clear. Catching sight of his walking reflection in the black picture window, he had to admit that his appearance was not yet as accomplished as hers—his face was too plump and his mouth too bland, his pants too well pressed and his shirt too fussily Madison Avenue—but sometimes late at night when his throat had gone sore and his eyes hot from talking, when he hunched his shoulders and set his jaw and pulled his necktie loose and let it hang like a rope, he could glare at the window and see the brave beginnings of a personage.

It was a strange time for the children, too. What exactly did going to France in the fall mean? And why did their mother keep insisting it was going to be fun, as if daring them to doubt it? For that matter, why was she so funny about a lot of things? In the afternoons she would hug them and ask them questions in a rush of ebullience that suggested Christmas Eve, and then her eyes would go out of focus during their replies, and a minute later she’d be saying “Yes, darling, but don’t talk quite so much, okay? Give Mommy a break.”

Nor did their father’s homecoming do much to help: he might throw them high in the air and give them airplane rides around the house until they were dizzy, but only after having failed to see them altogether during the disturbingly long time it took him to greet their mother at the kitchen door. And the talking at dinner! It was hopeless for either child to try and get a word in edgewise. Michael found he could jiggle in his chair, repeat baby words over and over in a shrill idiot’s monotone or stuff his mouth with mashed potato and hang his jaws open, all without any adult reproof; Jennifer would sit very straight at the table and refuse to look at him, feigning great interest in whatever her parents were saying, though afterwards, waiting for bedtime, she would sometimes go off quietly by herself and suck her thumb.

There was one consolation: they could go to sleep without any fear of being waked in an hour by the abrupt, thumping, hard-breathing, door-slamming sounds of a fight; all that, apparently, was a thing of the past. They could lie drowsing now under the sound of kindly voices in the living room, a sound whose intricately rhythmic rise and fall would slowly turn into the shape of their dreams.

And if they came awake later to turn over and reach with their toes for new cool places in the sheets, they knew the sound would still be there—one voice very deep and the other soft and pretty, talking and talking, as substantial and soothing as a blue range of mountains seen from far away.

“This whole country’s rotten with sentimentality,” Frank said one night, turning ponderously from the window to walk the carpet. “It’s been spreading like a disease for years, for generations, until now everything you touch is flabby with it.”

“Exactly,” she said, enraptured with him.

“I mean isn’t that really what’s the matter, when you get right down to it? I mean even more than the profit motive or the loss of spiritual values or the fear of the bomb or any of those things? Or maybe it’s the result of those things; maybe it’s what happens when all those things start working at once without any real cultural tradition to absorb them. Anyway, whatever it’s the result of, it’s what’s killing the United States. I mean isn’t it? This steady, insistent vulgarizing of every idea and every emotion into some kind of pre-digested intellectual baby food; this optimistic, smiling-through, easy-way-out sentimentality in everybody’s view of life?”

“Yes,” she said. “Yes.”

“And I mean is it any wonder all the men end up emascu-lated? Because that is what happens; that is what’s reflected in all this bleating about ‘adjustment’ and ‘security’ and

‘togetherness’—and I mean Christ, you see it everywhere: all this television crap where every joke is built on the premise that daddy’s an idiot and mother’s always on to him; and these loathsome little signs people put up in their front yards—you ever notice those signs up on the Hill?”

“The ‘The’ signs, you mean; with the people’s name in the plural? Like ‘The Donaldsons’?”

“Right!” He turned and smiled down at her in tri-umphant congratulation for having seen exactly what he meant. “Never ‘Donaldson’ or ‘John J. Donaldson’ or whatever the hell his name is. Always ‘The Donaldsons.’

You picture the whole cozy little bunch of them sitting around all snug as bunnies in their pajamas, for God’s sake, toasting marshmallows. I guess the Campbells haven’t put up a sign like that yet, but give ’em time. The rate they’re going now, they will.” He paused here for a deep-throated laugh. “And my God, when you think how close we came to settling into that kind of an existence.”

“But we didn’t,” she told him. “That’s the important thing.”

Another time, quite late, he walked up close to the sofa and sat down on the edge of the coffee table, facing her.

“You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way?” He felt tense and keyed up; the very act of sitting on a coffee table seemed an original and wonderful thing to do. “It’s like coming out of a Cellophane bag. It’s like having been encased in some kind of Cellophane for years without knowing it, and suddenly breaking out. It’s a little like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I remember acting very grim and scared because that was the fashionable way to act, but I couldn’t really put my heart in it. I mean I was scared, of course, but that’s not the point.

What I really felt didn’t have anything to do with being scared or not scared. I just felt this terrific sense of life. I felt full of blood. Everything looked realer than real; the snow on the fields, the road, the trees, the terrific blue sky all marked up with vapor trails—everything. And all the hel-mets and overcoats and rifles, and the way the guys were walking; I sort of loved them, even the guys I didn’t like.

And I remember being very conscious of the way my own body worked, and the sound of the breathing in my nose. I remember we went through this shelled-out town, all broken walls and rubble, and I thought it was beautiful. Hell, I was probably just as dumb and scared as anybody else, but inside I’d never felt better. I kept thinking: this is really true. This is the truth.”

“I felt that way once too,” she said, and in the shyness of her lips he saw that something overpoweringly tender was coming next.

“When?” He was as bashful as a schoolboy, unable to look her full in the face.

“The first time you made love to me.”

The coffee table tipped absurdly and banged straight again, rattling its cups, as he moved from its edge to the edge of the sofa and took her in his arms; and the evening was over.

It wasn’t until a good many such evenings had passed—

until the time, in fact, when he had again begun to think in terms of time passing—that the first faint discordances crept into their talk.

Once he interrupted her to say, “Listen, why do we keep talking about Paris? Don’t they have government agencies pretty much all over Europe? Why not Rome? Or Venice, or some place like Greece, even? I mean let’s keep an open mind; Paris isn’t the only place.”

“Of course it isn’t.” She was impatiently brushing a fleck of ash off her lap. “But it does seem the most logical place to start, doesn’t it? With the advantage of your knowing the language and everything?”

If he’d looked at the window at that moment he would have seen the picture of a frightened liar. The language!

Had he ever really led her to believe he could speak French?

“Well,” he said, chuckling and walking away from her, “I wouldn’t be too sure about that. I’ve probably forgotten most of what little I knew, and I mean I never did know the language in the sense of—you know, being able to speak it fluently or anything; just barely enough to get by.”

“That’s all we’ll need. You’ll pick it up again in no time.

We both will. And besides, at least you’ve been there. You know how the city’s laid out and what the various neighborhoods are like; that’s important.”

And he silently assured himself that this, after all, was substantially true. He knew where most of the picture-postcard landmarks were, on the strength of his several three-day passes in the city long ago; he also knew how to go from any of those places to where the American PX and Red Cross Club had once been established, and how to go from those points to the Place Pigalle, and how to choose the better kind of prostitute there and what her room would probably smell like. He knew those things, and he knew too that the best part of Paris, the part where the people really knew how to live, began around St. Germain des Prés and extended southeast (or was it southwest?) as far as the Café Dome. But this latter knowledge was based more on his reading of The Sun Also Rises in high school than in his real-life venturings into the district, which had mostly been lonely and footsore. He had admired the ancient delicacy of the buildings and the way the street lamps made soft explosions of light green in the trees at night, and the way each long, bright café awning would prove to reveal a sea of intelligently walking faces as he passed; but the white wine gave him a headache and the talking faces all seemed, on closer inspection, to belong either to intimidating men with beards or to women whose eyes could sum him up and dismiss him in less than a second. The place had filled him with a sense of wisdom hovering just out of reach, of unspeakable grace prepared and waiting just around the corner, but he’d walked himself weak down its endless blue streets and all the people who knew how to live had kept their tantalizing secret to themselves, and time after time he had ended up drunk and puk-ing over the tailgate of the truck that bore him jolting back into the army.

Je suis, he practiced to himself while April went on talking; tu es; nous sommes; vous êtes; ils sont.

“. . . better once we get settled,” she was saying, “don’t you think? You’re not listening.”

“Sure I am. No, I’m sorry, I guess I wasn’t.” And he sat down on the coffee table, smiling with what he hoped was a disarming candor. “I was just thinking that none of this is going to be easy—taking off to a foreign country with the kids and all. I mean, we’ll be running into a lot of problems we can’t even begin to anticipate from this end.”

“Well, certainly we will,” she said. “And certainly it’s not going to be easy. Do you know anything worth doing that is?”

“Of course not. You’re right. I’m just kind of tired tonight, I guess. Would you like a drink?”

“No thanks.”

He went to the kitchen and got one for himself, which brightened him; and there were no further difficulties until the next night, or the next, when she made a startling dis-closure about how she’d spent her day.

He had assumed that she too would be lazy and absent-minded in the daytime; he had pictured her taking long baths and devoting whole hours to the bedroom mirror, trying on different dresses and new ways of fixing her hair—perhaps leaving the mirror only to waltz lightly away on the strains of imaginary violins, whirling in a dream through the sunlit house and returning to smile over her shoulder at her own flushed image, and then having to hurry to get the beds made and the rooms in order in time for his homecoming. But it turned out that on this particular day she had driven to New York right after breakfast, had undergone an interview and filled out a lengthy job application with an overseas employment office, had gone from there to make the necessary arrangements for their passports, had obtained three travel brochures and the schedules of half a dozen steamship companies and airlines, had bought two new traveling bags, a French dictionary, a street guide to Paris, a copy of Babar the Elephant for the children and a book called Brighter French (“For Bright People Who Already Know Some”), and had sped home and relieved the baby sitter just in time to get the dinner started and mix a pitcherful of martinis.

“Aren’t you tired?”

“Not really. It was sort of invigorating. Do you realize how long it’s been since I spent a day in town? I was going to pop into the office at lunchtime and surprise you, but there wasn’t time. What’s the matter?”

“Nothing. It just sort of throws me, that’s all; the amount of stuff you can get done in one day. Pretty impressive.”

“You’re annoyed,” she said, “aren’t you. Oh, and I don’t blame you.” She puckered her face into what looked distressingly like the understanding simper of the wife in a television comedy. “It must seem as if I’m sort of taking over, doesn’t it—taking charge of everything.”

“No,” he protested, “no, listen, don’t be silly; I’m not annoyed. It doesn’t matter.”

“It does matter, though. It’s like when I mow the lawn, or something. I knew I should’ve left the passports and the travel agent for you to handle, but I was right there in the neighborhood and it seemed silly not to stop in. Oh, but I am sorry.”

“Look, will you cut it out? I’m going to start getting annoyed in a minute, if you keep on at this. Will you please forget it?”

“All right.”

“This probably won’t be much use to us,” he said, fingering through the pages of Brighter French. “I mean, I think it’s a little advanced.”

“Oh, that. Yes, I guess it’s sort of a supercilious little book; I just grabbed it in a hurry. That’s another thing I should’ve left for you to do. You’re always much better at things like that than I am.”

It was the night after that when she told him, looking remorseful, that she had some bad news. “I mean not really bad, but annoying. First of all Mrs. Givings called up today and issued this very formal invitation to dinner tomorrow night, and naturally I said no; I said we couldn’t get a baby sitter. Then she started trying to pin me down for a night next week and I kept begging off, until I realized we are going to have to see her soon anyway, about putting the house on the market, so I said why didn’t they come here for dinner.”

“Oh Jesus.”

“No, don’t worry, they’re not coming—you know how she is. She kept babbling about not wanting to put us to any trouble—Lord, what a pain that woman can be—and I kept insisting we did want to see her anyway, on business, and this went on for half an hour until I finally worked her around to saying she’d come over alone tomorrow night.

So it’ll be after dinner, strictly business, and with any kind of luck we’ll never have to see her again except to sell the house.”

“Fine.”

“Yes, but here’s the trouble. I’d completely forgotten we were supposed to be going to the Campbells’ tomorrow night. So I called Milly and tried using the same lie about the baby sitter, and she seemed—I don’t know, really upset. You know how Milly is sometimes? It’s like dealing with a child.

And the first thing I knew she had me saying yes, we’d come tonight instead. So there goes the weekend—Campbells tonight, Givings tomorrow. I’m awfully sorry, Frank.”



“Hell, that’s all right. Is that all you meant by bad news?”

“You’re sure you don’t mind?”

He didn’t mind at all. In fact, he realized as he washed up and changed his shirt, he was looking forward with eagerness to telling the Campbells of the plan. A thing like this never really seemed real until you’d told somebody about it.

“Listen, though, April,” he said, stuffing in his shirttail.

“When we’re breaking it to Mrs. Givings, there isn’t any reason why we have to tell her what we’re going to do in Europe, is there? I mean I think she thinks I’m enough of a creep as it is.”

“Of course not.” She looked surprised at the very idea of telling Mrs. Givings anything at all beyond the simple fact of their wish to sell the house. “What possible business is it of hers? There’s no need to tell the Campbells either, for that matter.”

“Oh no,” he said quickly, “we have to tell them—” and he almost said, “They’re our friends” before he caught himself. “I mean, you know; of course we don’t have to. But why not?”
