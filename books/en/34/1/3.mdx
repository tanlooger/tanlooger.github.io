title: THREE

a shrill metallic whine cut through the silence of his sleep. He tried to hide from it, huddling deeper into a cool darkness where the mists of an absorbing dream still floated, but it came tearing back again and again until his eyes popped open in the sunshine.

It was after eleven o’clock, Saturday morning. Both his nostrils were plugged as if with rubber cement, his head ached, and the first fly of the season was crawling up the inside of a clouded whiskey glass that stood on the floor beside a nearly empty bottle. Only after making these discoveries did he begin to remember the events of the night—how he’d sat here drinking until four in the morning, methodically scratching his scalp with both hands, convinced that sleep was out of the question. And only after remembering this did his mind come into focus on an explanation of the noise: it was his own rusty lawnmower, which needed oiling. Somebody was cutting the grass in the back yard, a thing he had promised to do last weekend.



He rolled heavily upright and groped for his bathrobe, moistening the wrinkled roof of his mouth. Then he went and squinted through the brilliant window. It was April herself, stolidly pushing and hauling the old machine, wearing a man’s shirt and a pair of loose, flapping slacks, while both children romped behind her with handfuls of cut grass.

In the bathroom he used enough cold water and toothpaste and Kleenex to revive the working parts of his head; he restored its ability to gather oxygen and regained a certain muscular control over its features. But nothing could be done about his hands. Bloated and pale, they felt as if all their bones had been painlessly removed. A command to clench them into fists would have sent him whimpering to his knees. Looking at them, and particularly at the bitten-down nails that never in his life had had a chance to grow, he wanted to beat and bruise them against the edge of the sink. He thought then of his father’s hands, and this reminded him that his dream just now, just before the lawnmower and the headache and the sun, had been of a dim and deeply tranquil time long ago. Both his parents had been there, and he’d heard his mother say, “Oh, don’t wake him, Earl; let him sleep.” He tried his best to remember more of it, and couldn’t; but the tenderness of it brought him close to tears for a moment until it faded away.

They had both been dead for several years now, and it sometimes troubled him that he could remember neither of their faces very well. To his waking memory, without the aid of photographs, his father was a vague bald head with dense eyebrows and a mouth forever fixed in the shape either of disgruntlement or exasperation, his mother a pair of rimless spectacles, a hair net, and a timorous smear of lipstick. He remembered too, of both of them, that they’d always been tired. Middle-aged at the time of his birth and already tired then from having raised two other sons, they had grown steadily more and more tired as long as he’d known them, until finally, tired out, they had died with equal ease, in their sleep, within six months of each other.

But there had never been anything tired about his father’s hands, and no amount of time and forgetfulness had ever dimmed their image in his mind’s eye.

“Open it!” That was one of his earliest memories: the challenge to loosen one big fist, and his frantic two-handed efforts, never succeeding, to uncoil a single finger from its massively quivering grip, while his father’s laughter rang from the kitchen walls. But it wasn’t only their strength he envied, it was their sureness and sensitivity—when they held a thing, you could see how it felt—and the aura of mastery they imparted to everything Earl Wheeler used: the creaking pigskin handle of his salesman’s briefcase, the hafts of all his woodworking tools, the thrillingly dangerous stock and trigger of his shotgun. The briefcase had been of particular fascination to Frank at the age of five or six; it always stood in the shadows of the front hallway in the evenings, and sometimes after supper he would saunter manfully up to it and pretend it was his own. How fine and smooth, yet how impossibly thick its handle felt! It was heavy (Whew!) yet how lightly it would swing at his father’s side in the morning! Later, at ten or twelve, he had become familiar with the carpentry tools as well, but none of his memories of them were pleasant. “No, boy, no!” his father would shout over the scream of the power saw. “You’re ruining it! Can’t you see you’re ruining it? That’s no way to handle a tool.” The tool, whatever obstinate thing it was, chisel or gouge or brace-and-bit, would be snatched away from the failure of its dismally sweat-stained woodwork and held aloft to be minutely inspected for damage. Then there would be a lecture on the proper care and handling of tools, to be followed by a gracefully expert demonstration (during which the grains of wood clung like gold in the hair of his father’s forearm) or more likely by a sigh of manly endurance pressed to the breaking point and the quiet words: “All right. You’d better go on upstairs.” Things had always ended that way in the woodworking shop, and even today he could never breathe the yellow smell of sawdust without a sense of humiliation. The shotgun, luckily, had never come to a test. By the time he was old enough to go along on one of his father’s increasingly rare hunting trips the chronic discord between them had long precluded any chance of it. It would never have occurred to the old man to suggest such a thing, and what’s more—for this was the period of his freight-train dreams—it would never have occurred to Frank to desire the suggestion. Who wanted to sit in a puddle and kill a lot of ducks? Who, for that matter, wanted to be good with hobbyist’s tools? And who wanted to be a dopey salesman in the first place, acting like a big deal with a briefcase full of boring catalogues, talking about machines all day to a bunch of dumb executives with cigars?

Yet even in those days and afterwards, even in the extremities of rebellion on Bethune Street, when his father had become a dreary, querulous old fool nodding to sleep over the Reader’s Digest, then as now he continued to believe that something unique and splendid had lived in his father’s hands. On Earl Wheeler’s very deathbed, when he was shrunken and blind and cackling (“Who’s that? Frank? Is that Frank?”) the dry clasp of his hands had been as positive as ever, and when they lay loose and still on the hospital sheet at last they still looked stronger and better than his son’s.

“Boy, I guess the headshrinkers could really have a ball with me,” he liked to say, wryly, among friends. “I mean the whole deal of my relationship with my father alone’d be enough to fill a textbook, not to mention my mother. Jesus, what a little nest of neuroses we must’ve been.” All the same, in moments of troubled solitude like this, he was glad he could muster some vestige of honest affection for his parents. He was grateful that however uneasy the rest of his life had turned out to be, it had once contained enough peace to give him pleasant dreams; and he often suspected, with more than a little righteousness, that this might be what kept him essentially more stable than his wife. Because if the headshrinkers could have a ball with him, God only knew what kind of a time they would have with April.

In all the scanty stories she told about them, her parents were as alien to his sympathetic understanding as anything in the novels of Evelyn Waugh. Had people like that ever really existed? He could picture them only as flickering car-icatures of the twenties, the Playboy and the Flapper, mysteriously rich and careless and cruel, married by a ship’s captain in mid-Atlantic and divorced within a year of the birth of their only child.

“I think my mother must’ve taken me straight from the hospital to Aunt Mary’s,” she’d told him. “At any rate I don’t think I ever lived with anyone but Aunt Mary until I was five, and then there were a couple of other aunts, or friends of hers or something, before I went to Aunt Claire, in Rye.” The rest of the story was that her father had shot himself in a Boston hotel room in 1938, and that her mother had died some years later after long incarceration in a West Coast alcoholic retreat.

“Jesus,” Frank said on first hearing these facts, one irrita-bly hot summer night in the Bethune Street place (though he wasn’t quite sure at the time, as he hung and shook his head, whether what he felt was sorrow for the unhappiness of the story or envy because it was so much more dramatic a story than his own). “Well,” he said. “I guess your aunt always really seemed like your mother, though, didn’t she?”

But April shrugged, drawing her mouth a little to one side in a way that he’d lately decided he didn’t like—her

“tough” look. “Which aunt do you mean? I hardly remember Mary, or the others in between, and I always hated Claire.”

“Oh, come on. How can you say you ‘always hated’ her?

I mean maybe it seems that way now, looking back, but over the years she must’ve given you a certain feeling of— you know, love, and security and everything.”

“She didn’t, though. The only real fun I ever had was when one of my parents came for a visit. They were the ones I loved.”

“But they hardly ever came for visits. I mean you couldn’t have had much sense of their being your parents, in a deal like that; you didn’t even know them. How could you love them?”

“I did, that’s all.” And she began picking up and putting away again, in her jewelry box, the souvenirs she had spread before him on the bed: snapshots of herself at various ages, on various lawns, standing with one or the other parent; a miniature painting of her mother’s pretty head; a yellowed, leather-framed photograph showing both parents, tall and elegantly dressed beside a palm tree, with the inscription Cannes, 1925; her mother’s wedding ring; an ancient brooch containing a lock of her maternal grandmother’s hair; a tiny white plastic horse, the size of a watch charm, which had a net value of two or three cents and had been saved for years because “my father gave it to me.”

“Oh, all right, sure,” he conceded. “Maybe they did seem romantic and everything; they probably seemed very dazzling and glamorous and all that. The point is, I don’t mean that. I mean love.”

“So do I. I did love them.” Her grave silence following this statement, as she fastened the clasp of the jewelry box, was so prolonged that he thought she had finished with the subject. He decided he was finished with it anyway, at least for the time being. It was too hot a night to have an argument. But it turned out that she was only thinking it over, preparing her next words with great care to make sure they would say exactly what she meant. When she began to speak at last she looked so much like the little girl in the photographs that he was ashamed of himself. “I loved their clothes,” she said. “I loved the way they talked. I loved to hear them tell about their lives.”

And there was nothing for him to do but take her in his arms, full of pity for the meagerness of her treasure and full of a reverent, silent promise, soon to be broken, that he would never again disparage it.

A small stain of drying milk and cereal on the table was all that remained of the children’s breakfast; the rest of the kitchen gleamed to an industrial perfection of cleanliness.

He planned, as soon as he’d had some coffee, to get dressed and go out and take the lawnmower away from her, by force if necessary, in order to restore as much balance to the morning as possible. But he was still in his bathrobe, unshaven and fumbling at the knobs of the electric stove, when Mrs. Givings’s station wagon came crackling up the driveway. For a second he thought of hiding, but it was too late. She had already seen him through the screen door, and April, trudging along the far border of the back yard, had already escaped her with a wave across the wide expanse of grass and gone on mowing. He was caught. He had to open the door and stand there in an attitude of welcome. Why did this woman keep bothering them all the time?

“I can’t stay a minute!” she cried, staggering toward him under the weight of a damp cardboard box full of earth and wobbling vegetation. “I just wanted to bring over this sedum for the rocky place at the foot of your drive. My, don’t you look comfy.”

He bent into an ungainly pose, trying to hold the door open with one trailing foot while he took the box from her arms. “Well,” he said, smiling very close to her tense, pow-dery face. Mrs. Givings’s cosmetics seemed always to have been applied in a frenzy of haste, of impatience to get the whole silly business over and done with, and she was constantly in motion, a trim, leather-skinned woman in her fifties whose eyes expressed a religious belief in the importance of keeping busy. Even when she stood still there was kinetic energy in the set of her shoulders and the hang of her loose, angrily buttoned-up clothes; when sitting was inevitable she always chose straight chairs and used them sparingly, and it was hard to imagine her ever lying down.

Nor was it easy to picture her face asleep, free from the tension of its false smiles, its little bursts of social laughter and its talk.

“I really think this is just what’s called for down there, don’t you?” she was saying. “Have you worked with this type of sedum before? You’ll find it’s the most marvelous ground cover, even in this acid soil.”

“Well,” he said again. “That’s fine. Thanks a lot, Mrs.

Givings.” Nearly two years ago she had asked them to call her Helen, a name his tongue seemed all but unable to pronounce. Usually he solved the problem by calling her nothing, covering the lack with friendly nods and smiles, and she had taken to calling him nothing either. Now, as her small eyes seemed to take in for the first time the fact that his wife was cutting the grass while he lounged around the kitchen in a bathrobe, they stood smiling at each other with uncommon brilliance. He let the screen clap shut behind him and adjusted his grip on the box, which wobbled in his arms and sent a fine stream of sand down his naked ankle.

“What should we—you know, do with it?” he asked her.

“I mean, you know, to make it grow and everything.”

“Well, nothing really. All it wants is just a tiny dollop of water the first few days, and then you’ll find it absolutely thrives. It’s rather like the European houseleek, you see, except of course that has the lovely pink flower and this has the yellow.”

“Oh, yeah,” he said. “House leak.” She told him a good many other things about the plants, while he nodded and watched her and wished she would go away, listening to the whir and whine of the lawnmower. “Well,” he said when her voice stopped. “That’s swell, thanks a lot. Can I—offer you a cup of coffee?”

“Oh, no, thanks ever so much—” She skittered four or five feet away, retreating, as if he had offered her a soiled handkerchief to blow her nose in. Then, from the safety of her new position, she displayed all her long teeth in an elaborate smile. “Do tell April we loved the play last night—or wait, I’ll tell her myself.” She craned and squinted into the sun, judging the distance her voice would have to travel, and then she let it loose:

“April! April! I just wanted to tell you we loved the play!”

Her strained, shouting face could have been the picture of a woman in agony.

After a second the sound of the lawnmower stopped and April’s distant voice said, “What’s that?”



“I say, we LOVED, the PLAY!”

And at last, on hearing April’s faint “Oh—thanks, Helen,”

she was able to slacken her features. She turned back to Frank, who was still clumsily holding the box. “You really do have a very gifted wife. I can’t tell you how much Howard and I enjoyed it.”

“Good,” he said. “Actually, I think the general consensus is that it wasn’t too great. I mean I think most people seemed to feel that way.”

“Oh, no, it was charming. I did think your nice friend up on the Hill was rather unfortunately cast—Mr. Crandall?—

but otherwise—”

“Campbell, yes. Actually, I don’t think he was any worse than some of the others; and of course he did have a difficult part.” He always felt it necessary to defend the Campbells to Mrs. Givings, whose view seemed to be that anyone who lived in the Revolutionary Hill Estates deserved at best a tactful condescension.

“I suppose that’s true. I was surprised not to see Mrs.

Crandall in the group—or Campbell, is it? Still, I don’t expect she’d have the time, with all those children.”

“She worked backstage.” He was trying to shift the box so that the sand would stop trickling, or trickle somewhere else. “She was quite active in the whole thing, as a matter of fact.”

“Oh, good. I’m sure she would be; such a friendly, willing little soul. All right, then—” She began sidling toward her car. “I won’t keep you.” This was the moment for her saying

“Oh, one other thing, while I think of it.” She nearly always did that, and the other thing would turn out to be the thing she had really come for in the first place. Now she hesitated, visibly wondering whether to say it or not; then her face showed her decision not to, under the circumstances.

Whatever it was would have to wait. “Fine, then. I simply love the stone path you’ve started down the front lawn.”

“Oh,” he said. “Thanks. I haven’t hardly started it yet.”

“Oh, I know,” she assured him. “It is hard work.” Then she trilled a gracious little two-note song of goodbye and twitched into her station wagon, which rolled slowly away.

“Mommy, look what Daddy’s got,” Jennifer was calling.

“Mrs. Givings brought it.”

And Michael, the four-year-old, said, “It’s flowers. Is it flowers, or what?”

They were hurrying toward him over the cropped grass, while April slowly and heavily brought up the rear, pulling the lawnmower behind her, blowing damp strands of hair away from her eyes with a stuck-out lower lip. Everything about her seemed determined to prove, with a new, flat-footed emphasis, that a sensible middle-class housewife was all she had ever wanted to be and that all she had ever wanted of love was a husband who would get out and cut the grass once in a while, instead of sleeping all day.

“It’s leaking, Daddy,” Jennifer said.

“I know it’s leaking. Quiet a minute. Listen,” he said to his wife, without quite looking at her. “Would you mind telling me what I’m supposed to do with this stuff?”

“How should I know? What is it?”

“I don’t know what the hell it is. It’s European house leak or something.”

“European what?”

“Oh no, wait a second. It’s like house leak, only it’s pink instead of yellow. Yellow instead of pink. I thought you’d probably know all about it.”

“Whatever made you think that?” She came up close to squint at the plants, fingering one of their fleshy stems.

“What’s it for? Didn’t she say?”

His mind was a blank. “Wait a second. It’s called beecham.

Or wait—seecham. I’m pretty sure it’s seecham.” He licked his lips and changed his grip on the box. “It’s marvelous in acid soil. Does that ring a bell?”

The children were switching their hopeful eyes from one parent to the other, and Jennifer was beginning to look worried.

April ran her fingers into her hip pockets. “Marvelous for what? You mean you didn’t even ask her?”

The plants were quivering in his arms. “Look, could you kind of take it easy? I haven’t had any coffee yet, and I—”

“Oh, this is swell. What am I supposed to do with this stuff? What am I supposed to tell the woman the next time I see her?”

“Tell her any God damn thing you like,” he said. “Maybe you could tell her to mind her own God damn business for a change.”

“Don’t shout, Daddy.” Jennifer was bouncing up and down in her grass-stained sneakers, flapping her hands and starting to cry.

“I’m not shouting,” he told her, with all the indignation of the falsely accused. She held still then and put her thumb in her mouth, which seemed to make her eyes go out of focus, while Michael clutched at the fly of his pants and took two backward steps, solemn with embarrassment.

April sighed and raked back a lock of hair. “All right,” she said. “Take it down to the cellar, then. The least we can do is get it out of sight. Then you’d better get dressed. It’s time for lunch.”

He carried the box down the cellar stairs, dropped it on the floor with a rustling thud and kicked it into a corner, sending a sharp pain through the tendon of his big toe.

He spent the afternoon in an old pair of army pants and a torn shirt, working on his stone path. The idea was to lay a long, curving walk from the front door to the road, to divert visitors from coming in through the kitchen. It had seemed simple enough last weekend, when he’d started it, but now as the ground sloped off more sharply he found that flat stones wouldn’t work. He had to make steps, of stones nearly as thick as they were wide, stones that had to be dislodged from the steep woods behind the house and carried on tottering legs around to the front lawn. And he had to dig a pit for each step, in ground so rocky that it took ten minutes to get a foot below the surface. It was turning into mindless, unrewarding work, the kind of work that makes you clumsy with fatigue and petulant with lack of progress, and it looked as if it would take all summer.

Even so, once the first puffing and dizziness was over, he began to like the muscular pull and the sweat of it, and the smell of the earth. At least it was a man’s work. At least, squatting to rest on the wooded slope, he could look down and see his house the way a house ought to look on a fine spring day, safe on its carpet of green, the frail white sanc-tuary of a man’s love, a man’s wife and children. Lowering his eyes with the solemnity of this thought, he could take pleasure in the sight of his own flexed thigh, lean and straining under the old O.D., and of the heavily veined forearm that lay across it and the dirty hand that hung there—not to be compared with his father’s hand, maybe, but a serviceable, good-enough hand all the same—so that his temples ached in zeal and triumph as he heaved a rock up from the suck of its white-wormed socket and let it roll end over end down the shuddering leafmold, because he was a man. Following it down to the edge of the lawn, he squatted over it again, grunted, wrestled it up to his thighs and from there to his waist, cradling it in the tender flesh of his forearms; then he moved out, glassy-eyed and staggering on the soft grass, out around the white blur of the house and into the sun of the front lawn and all the way over to the path, where he dropped it and nearly fell in a heap on top of it.

“We’re helping you, aren’t we, Daddy?” Jennifer said.

Both children had come to sit near him on the grass. The sun made perfect circles of yellow on their two blond heads and gave their T-shirts a dazzling whiteness.

“You sure are,” he said.

“Yes, because you like to have us keep you company, don’t you?”

“I sure do, baby. Don’t get too close now, you’ll kick dirt in the hole.” And he fell to work with the long-handled shovel to deepen the hollow he had dug, enjoying the rhythmic rasp and grip of the blade against a loosening edge of buried rock.

“Daddy?” Michael inquired. “Why does the shovel make sparks?”

“Because it’s hitting rock. When you hit rock with steel, you get a spark.”

“Why don’t you take the rock out?”

“That’s what I’m trying to do. Don’t get so close now, you might get hurt.”

The piece of rock came free at last; he lifted it out and knelt to claw at the sliding tan pebbles of the pit until the depth and the shape of it looked right. Then he heaved and rolled the boulder into place and packed it tight, and another step was completed. A light swarm of gnats had come to hover around his head, tickling and barely visible as they hung and flicked past his eyes.

“Daddy?” Jennifer said. “How come Mommy slept on the sofa?”

“I don’t know. Just happened to feel like it, I guess. You wait here, now, while I go and get another stone.”

And the more he thought about it, as he plodded back up through the trees behind the house, the more he realized that this was the best answer he could have given, from the standpoint of simple honesty as well as tact. She just happened to feel like it. Wasn’t that, after all, the only reason there was? Had she ever had a less selfish, more complicated reason for doing anything in her life?

“I love you when you’re nice,” she’d told him once, before they were married, and it had made him furious.

“Don’t say that. Christ’s sake, you don’t ‘love’ people when they’re ‘nice.’ Don’t you see that’s the same as saying

‘What’s in it for me?’ Look.” (They were standing on Sixth Avenue in the middle of the night, and he was holding her at arm’s length, his hands placed firmly on either side of the warm rib cage inside her polo coat.) “Look. You either love me or you don’t, and you’re going to have to make up your mind.”

Oh, she’d made up her mind, all right. It had been easy to decide in favor of love on Bethune Street, in favor of walking proud and naked on the grass rug of an apartment that caught the morning sun among its makeshift chairs, its French travel posters and its bookcase made of packing-crate slats—an apartment where half the fun of having an affair was that it was just like being married, and where later, after a trip to City Hall and back, after a ceremonial collecting of the other two keys from the other two men, half the fun of being married was that it was just like having an affair. She’d decided in favor of that, all right. And why not? Wasn’t it the first love of any kind she’d ever known?

Even on the level of practical advantage it must have held an undeniable appeal: it freed her from the gritty round of disappointment she would otherwise have faced as an only mildly talented, mildly enthusiastic graduate of dramatic school; it let her languish attractively through a part-time office job (“just until my husband finds the kind of work he really wants to do”) while saving her best energies for animated discussions of books and pictures and the shortcomings of other people’s personalities, for trying new ways of fixing her hair and new kinds of inexpensive clothes (“Do you really like the sandals, or are they too Villagey?”) and for hours of unhurried dalliance deep in their double bed.

But even in those days she’d held herself poised for immediate flight; she had always been ready to take off the minute she happened to feel like it (“Don’t talk to me that way, Frank, or I’m leaving. I mean it”) or the minute anything went wrong.

And one big thing went wrong right away. According to their plan, which called for an eventual family of four, her first pregnancy came seven years too soon. That was the trouble, and if he’d known her better then he might have guessed how she would take it and what she would happen to feel like doing about it. At the time, though, coming home from the doctor’s office in a steaming crosstown bus, he was wholly in the dark. She refused to look at him as they rode; she carried her head high in a state of shock or disbelief or anger or blame—it could have been any or all or none of these things, for all he knew. Pressed close and sweating beside her with his jaw set numbly in a brave smile, trying to think of things to say, he knew only that everything was out of kilter. Whatever you felt on hearing the news of conception, even if it was chagrin instead of joy, wasn’t it supposed to be something the two of you shared?

Your wife wasn’t supposed to turn away from you, was she?

You weren’t supposed to have to work and wheedle to win her back, with little jokes and hand-holdings, as if you were afraid she might evaporate at the very moment of this first authentic involvement of your lives—that couldn’t be right.

Then what the hell was the matter?

It wasn’t until a week later that he came home to find her stalking the apartment with folded arms, her eyes remote and her face fixed in the special look that meant she had made up her mind about something and would stand for no nonsense.

“Frank, listen. Try not to start talking until I finish, and just listen.” And in an oddly stifled voice, as if she’d rehearsed her speech several times without allowing for the fact that she’d have to breathe while delivering it, she told him of a girl in dramatic school who knew, from first-hand experience, an absolutely infallible way to induce a miscarriage. It was simplicity itself: you waited until just the right time, the end of the third month; then you took a sterilized rubber syringe and a little bit of sterilized water, and you very carefully . . .

Even as he filled his lungs for shouting he knew it wasn’t the idea itself that repelled him—the idea itself, God knew, was more than a little attractive—it was that she had done all this on her own, in secret, had sought out the girl and obtained the facts and bought the rubber syringe and rehearsed the speech; that if she’d thought about him at all it was only as a possible hitch in the scheme, a source of tiresome objections that would have to be cleared up and disposed of if the thing were to be carried out with maxi-mum efficiency. That was the intolerable part of it; that was what enriched his voice with a tremor of outrage: “Christ’s sake, don’t be an idiot. You want to kill yourself?

I don’t even want to hear about it.”

She sighed patiently. “All right, Frank. In that case there’s certainly no need for you to hear about it. I only told you because I thought you might be willing to help me in this thing. Obviously, I should have known better.”

“Listen. Listen to me. You do this—you do this and I swear to God I’ll—”

“Oh, you’ll what? You’ll leave me? What’s that supposed to be—a threat or a promise?”

And the fight went on all night. It caused them to hiss and grapple and knock over a chair, it spilled outside and downstairs and into the street (“Get away from me! Get away from me!”); it washed them trembling up against the high wire fence of a waterfront junkyard, until a waterfront drunk came to stare at them and make them waver home, and he could feel the panic and the shame of it even now, leaning here against this tree with these gnats tickling his neck. All that saved him, all that enabled him now to crouch and lift a new stone from its socket and follow its rumbling fall with the steady and dignified tread of self-respect, was that the next day he had won. The next day, weeping in his arms, she had allowed herself to be dissuaded.

“Oh, I know, I know,” she had whispered against his shirt, “I know you’re right. I’m sorry. I love you. We’ll name it Frank and we’ll send it to college and everything. I promise, promise.”

And it seemed to him now that no single moment of his life had ever contained a better proof of manhood than that, if any proof were needed: holding that tamed, submis-sive girl and saying, “Oh, my lovely; oh, my lovely,” while she promised she would bear his child. Lurching and swaying under the weight of the stone in the sun, dropping it at last and wiping his sore hands, he picked up the shovel and went to work again, while the children’s voices fluted and chirped around him, as insidiously torturing as the gnats.

And I didn’t even want a baby, he thought to the rhythm of his digging. Isn’t that the damnedest thing? I didn’t want a baby any more than she did. Wasn’t it true, then, that everything in his life from that point on had been a succession of things he hadn’t really wanted to do? Taking a hopelessly dull job to prove he could be as responsible as any other family man, moving to an overpriced, genteel apartment to prove his mature belief in the fundamentals of orderliness and good health, having another child to prove that the first one hadn’t been a mistake, buying a house in the country because that was the next logical step and he had to prove himself capable of taking it. Proving, proving; and for no other reason than that he was married to a woman who had somehow managed to put him forever on the defensive, who loved him when he was nice, who lived according to what she happened to feel like doing and who might at any time—this was the hell of it—who might at any time of day or night just happen to feel like leaving him.

It was as ludicrous and as simple as that.

“Are you hitting rock again, Daddy?”

“Not this time,” he said. “This is a root. I think it’s too deep to matter, though. If you’ll just get out of the way now, I’ll try and fit the stone in.”

Kneeling, he rolled the boulder into place, but it wouldn’t settle. It wobbled, and it sat three inches too high.

“That’s too high, Daddy.”

“I know it, baby.” He laboriously pried the stone out again and began hacking at the root, trying to cut it, using the shovel like a clumsy ax. It was as tough as cartilage.

“Sweetie, I said don’t come so close. You’re kicking dirt in the hole.”

“I’m helping, Daddy.”

Jennifer looked hurt and surprised, and he thought she might be going to cry again. He tried to make his voice very low and gentle. “Look, everybody. Why don’t you find something else to do? You’ve got the whole yard to play in. Come on, now. That’s the idea. I’ll call you if I need any help.”

But in a minute they were back, sitting too close and talking quietly together. Dizzy with effort and blind with sweat, he was straddling the pit and holding the shovel vertically, like a pile driver, lifting it high and bringing it down with all his strength on the root. He had torn a ragged wound in it, laying open its moist white meat, but it wouldn’t break, it wouldn’t give, and it made the children laugh each time the shovel bounced and rang in his hands. The delicate noise of their laughter, the look of their tulip-soft skin and of their two sunny skulls, as fragile as eggshell, made a terrible con-trast to the feel of biting steel and shuddering pulp, and it was his sense of this that made his eyes commit a distortion of truth. For a split second, in the act of bringing the shovel blade down, he thought he saw Michael’s white sneaker slip into its path. Even as he swerved and threw the shovel away with a clang he knew it hadn’t really happened—but it could have happened, that was the point—and his anger was so quick that the next thing he knew he had grabbed him by the belt and spun him around and hit him hard on the buttocks with the flat of his hand, twice, surprised at the stunning vigor of the blows and at the roar of his own voice: “Get outa here now! Get outa here!”



Leaping and twisting, clutching the seat of his pants with both hands, Michael found his need to cry so sudden and so deep that for several seconds after the first shocked squeal no sound could break from him. His eyes wrinkled shut, his mouth opened and was locked in that position while his lungs fought for breath; then out it came, a long high wail of pain and humiliation. Jennifer watched him, round-eyed, and in the next breath her own face began to twitch and crumple and she was crying too.

“I kept telling you and telling you,” he explained to them, waving his arms. “I told you there’d be trouble if you got too close. Didn’t I? Didn’t I? All right now, take off.

Both of you.”

They didn’t need to be told. They were moving steadily away from him across the grass, crying, looking back at him with infinite reproachfulness. In another second he might have been running after them with apologies, he might have been crying too, if he hadn’t forced himself to pick up the shovel and bang it at the root again; and as he worked he prepared an anxious, silent brief in his own defense. Well, damn it, I did keep telling them and telling them, he assured himself, and by now his mind had mercifully amended the facts. The kid put his foot right the hell in my way, for God’s sake. If I hadn’t swerved just in time he wouldn’t have a foot, for God’s sake. . . .

When he looked up again he saw that April had come out of the kitchen door and around the side of the house, and he saw that the children had run to her and hidden their faces in her trousers.
