title: FIVE

the architects of the knox building had wasted no time in trying to make it look taller than its twenty stories, with the result that it looked shorter. They hadn’t bothered trying to make it handsome, either, and so it was ugly: slab-sided and flat-topped, with a narrow pea-green cornice that jutted like the lip of a driven stake. It stood in an appropriately humdrum section of lower midtown, and from the very day of its grand opening, early in the century, it must clearly have been destined to settle deep into that smoke-hung clutter of numberless rectilinear shapes out of which, in aerial photographs, the mightier towers of New York emerge and rise.

But for all its plainness, the Knox Building did convey a quality of massive common sense. If it lacked grandeur, at least it had bulk; if there was nothing heroic about it, there was certainly nothing frivolous; it was a building that meant business.

“There it is, Frank,” Earl Wheeler said to his son on a summer morning in 1935. “Straight ahead. That’s the Home Office. Better take my hand here, this is a bad crossing . . .”

It was the only time Frank had ever been brought to New York by his father, and it had come as the climax to an exhilarating several weeks that always seemed, in retro-spect, the only time his father could ever have been described as jovial. During that time the cryptic phrase

“Oat Fields” had flown in happy profusion through his father’s dinner-table talk, along with “New York” and “The Home Office,” and had repeatedly caused his mother to say

“Oh, that’s wonderful, Earl,” and “Oh, I’m so glad.” Frank had eventually figured out that Oat Fields had nothing whatever to do with Quaker Oats but was in fact the odd name of a man—Mr. Oat Fields—a man remarkable not only in his size (“One of the biggest men in the Home Office”) but in his intellectual astuteness. And he’d scarcely put this information straight in his mind before being presented, by his mother, with some startling news. Mr. Oat Fields, upon learning that Mr. Earl Wheeler had a son of ten, had invited that son to accompany his father on a visit to the Home Office. Father and son would then be the guests of Mr. Fields at luncheon (it was the first time he’d ever heard her use that word instead of lunch), following which Mr. Fields would take them to a ball game at Yankee Stadium. In the next few days the suspense had grown all but intolerable until it threatened to spoil everything on the morning of the trip: he very nearly threw up his breakfast from tension and trainsickness on the way to town, and might have done it in the taxi too if they hadn’t gotten out to walk the last several blocks in the fresh air; but with the clearing of his head as they walked it began to seem that everything was going to be fine.



“There,” his father said when they’d crossed the street.

“Now, here’s the barbershop, that’s where we’re going for our haircuts in a minute, and here’s the subway—see how they’ve built the subway entrance right into the building? —

and look over here, this is the display room. These windows run the entire length of the building, from here on. Lot bigger than our dinky old showroom out home, isn’t it?

And look—these are just a few of the products we make.

Here’s your typewriters, of course, and your adders and calculators and some of your different kinds of filing systems, and that’s one of the new bookkeeping machines back there in the corner; and then look over here, in the next window.

These are your punched-card machines. That big one is your tabulator, and the little one beside it is your sorter.

When you watch a demonstration of that baby, it’s really a sight to see. Fella takes a deck of punched cards, stacks ’em, puts ’em in there and presses a button, and those old cards go flying through there lickety-split.”

But Frank’s eyes kept wandering from the machines to his own reflection in the plate glass. He thought he looked surprisingly dignified in his new suit, with its coat and tie almost exactly like his father’s, and it pleased him to see this bright image of the two of them, man and boy, with the endless swarm of people moving past on the sidewalk behind them. After a minute he backed several steps away and looked straight up, until his collar cramped the back of his neck, and Wow! He would admit he’d hoped for a sky-scraper, but the last of his disappointment was vanishing now in this one long look. Up and up and up the tiers of windows rose, each smaller and more foreshortened than the one beneath, until their ever-narrowing sills and lintels seemed to merge. Imagine falling from the very top floor!

Then he saw that the high, high cornice was moving slowly and steadily forward against the sky—the building was falling over on them!—but there was no time for panic before he saw his mistake: it was the sky that moved, white clouds floating back over the ledge of the roof, and at the instant his mind came into focus on this fact he felt a shiver of wonder down his spine at the enormous granite strength and stillness of the building. Wow!

“All set?” his father was saying. “Let’s go to the barber’s, then, and get fixed up, and then we’ll go on inside. We’re going to ride the elevator all the way up to the top.”

But as things turned out, that preliminary moment on the sidewalk was the high point of the day. The barbershop proved to be nice enough, and so did the echoing marble-flagged lobby, which smelled of cigars and umbrellas and ladies’ perfume, but from there on the pleasures of the day began to dwindle steadily. The elevator gave no sense of flight, for one thing, but only of confinement and nausea.

Of the office itself, the top floor, he remembered only an acre of white lights and a very thin lady whose openwork blouse revealed an incredible number of straps that were apparently connected with her underwear, who called him Sonny and showed him how the water cooler worked (“Look, Sonny; watch the big bubble come up when I press the button—Blurp!—isn’t that funny? Here, you try it”); and he would never forget the instantaneous revulsion he felt in the presence of Mr. Oat Fields, who if not the biggest was certainly the fattest man he had ever seen. Oat Fields’s glasses mirrored staring images of the office lights, so that you couldn’t see what his eyes were doing when he talked to you, and he talked in a very loud voice without seeming to hear your replies.

“Well, aren’t you a big fella! What’s your name? Huh?

You like school? Well, that’s fine. You like baseball? Huh?”



The worst part of him was his mouth, which was so wet that a dozen shining strands of spittle clung and trembled between his moving lips; and it was this as much as anything that hampered Frank’s enjoyment of the lunch, or luncheon, which took place in the restaurant of a great hotel. Oat Fields’s mouth did not close while chewing and it left white streaks of food on the rim of his water glass. Once he softened the hard crust of a roll by holding it submerged in the gravy boat for some time before he lifted it to his reaching lips, allowing part of it to fall and leave a bright tan stain on his vest.

“You’re absolutely right, Oat,” Earl Wheeler kept saying throughout the meal, and “I certainly do agree with you on that,” and the few times he glanced at Frank it was with startled eyes, as if surprised to find him sitting there. The ball game was a letdown too: nobody hit a home run, and in Frank’s limited knowledge of the game a home run was all that mattered. For the last hour of it the sun slanted straight in his eyes, giving him a headache, and he had to go to the bathroom but didn’t know how to broach the subject.

Then came the grimy ordeal of subway connections to Penn Station, during which his father took him angrily to task for having failed to say “Thank you I had a very nice time” to Oat Fields. In the bleak light of the trainshed, as they stood waiting for the gates to open, he stared unno-ticed at the physical exhaustion and moral defeat in his father’s face, which looked loose and porous and very old.

Then, lowering his eyes, he discovered that his father’s trouser leg was slightly and rhythmically twitching with the anxious movement of his pocketed fingers on his genitals.

And that, ultimately, would become his most vivid single remembrance of the day; at the time, though, later that same night as he staggered and crouched barefoot in the tilting, oddly shrunken bathroom of his home, it was his memory’s vision of Oat Fields’s eating mouth that made the spasms of vomiting come again and again.

Not until years later was he able to piece the simple facts of the case together. Earl Wheeler, having clung to an assistant branch managership in Newark through any number of Depression layoffs and cutbacks, had somehow come to Home Office attention as a candidate for the job of right-hand man to Oat Fields (and not until later still did he guess the explanation of that name—the fact that in a world of mandatory diminutives, a corporation of jolly Bills and Jacks and Herbs and Teds in which an unabbreviable given name like Earl must always have been a minor handicap,

“Oat” was the best that could be done for a man with the given name of Otis). But the promotion had fallen through; higher authority had decreed that Oat Fields could get along without a right-hand man, and Earl Wheeler must either have learned or guessed this outcome at some point during the luncheon or the ball game.

And whether or not he ever came to accept the disappointment, Frank knew that to the end of his life he never understood it. It must, for that matter, have been the first of many events that passed Earl Wheeler’s understanding, for it came at the beginning of his decline. In the years after that he was transferred from one field assignment to another until his retirement soon after the war (and not long after Oat Fields’s own retirement and death), by which time he had slipped from the assistant-manager level to that of an ordinary salesman in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And in those years too, with increasing bewilderment, he had failed to understand the weakening of his health, the rapid difficult aging of his wife, the indifference of his two older sons—and finally the shrill rebellion, the desertion and the moral collapse of his youngest.

A longshoreman! A cafeteria cashier! An ungrateful, spiteful, foul-mouthed weakling, boozing his way through Greenwich Village with God only knew what kind of companions; a punk kid with no more sense of decency than to drive his mother nearly out of her mind not writing for six, eight months and then mailing a letter with no return address and the postscript: “Got married last week—might bring her out sometime.”

It was a lucky thing for Earl Wheeler, then, that he wasn’t present in a cheap bar near the Columbia campus one noontime in 1948, when his son sat in conference with another slouching youth named Sam, a graduate student in philosophy who held a part-time job in the student placement office.

“So what’s the problem, Frank? I thought you’d be back in Europe by now.”

“Big joke. April’s knocked up.”

“Oh Jesus.”

“No, but listen; there’re all different kinds of ways of looking at a thing like this, Sam. Look at it this way. I need a job; okay. Is that any reason why the job I get has to louse me up? Look. All I want is to get enough dough coming in to keep us solvent for the next year or so, till I can figure things out; meanwhile I want to retain my own identity.

Therefore the thing I’m most anxious to avoid is any kind of work that can be considered ‘interesting’ in its own right.

I want something that can’t possibly touch me. I want some big, swollen old corporation that’s been bumbling along making money in its sleep for a hundred years, where they have to hire eight guys for every one job because none of them can be expected to care about whatever boring thing it is they’re supposed to be doing. I want to go into that kind of place and say, Look. You can have my body and my nice college-boy smile for so many hours a day, in exchange for so many dollars, and beyond that we’ll leave each other strictly alone. Get the picture?”

“I think so,” said the philosophy student. “Come on back to the office.” And there, adjusting his glasses and thumbing through a card index, Sam began to write out a list of companies that seemed to fit the picture: a great copper-and-brass manufacturer, a great public utility, a gigantic firm that made all kinds of paper bags . . .

But when Frank saw the awesome name of Knox Business Machines being added to the list he thought there must be some mistake. “Hey, no, wait a minute; I know that can’t be right—” and he gave a brief oral summary of his father’s career, which caused the philosophy student to enjoy a pleasant chuckle.

“I think you’ll find things’ve changed a little since your old man’s time, Frank,” he said. “That was the Depression, don’t forget. Besides, he was out in the field; you’d be in the home office. As a matter of fact this place is just what you’re looking for. I happen to know they’ve got guys sitting around that building that never lift a finger except to pick up their checks. I’d certainly mention your father, though, when you go for the interview. Probably help things along.”

But Frank, as he walked into the shadow of the Knox Building with the ghosts of that other visit crowding his head (“Better take my hand here, this is a bad crossing . . .”), decided it would be more fun not to mention his father in the interview at all. And he didn’t, and he got a job that very day on the fifteenth floor, in something called the Sales Promotion Department.



“The sales what?” April inquired. “ ‘ Promotion?’ I don’t get it. What does that mean you’re supposed to do?”

“Who the hell knows? They explained it to me for half an hour and I still don’t know, and I don’t think they do either. No, but it’s pretty funny, isn’t it? Old Knox Business Machines. Wait’ll I tell the old man. Wait’ll he hears I didn’t even use his name.”

And so it started as a kind of joke. Others might fail to see the humor of it, but it filled Frank Wheeler with a secret, astringent delight as he discharged his lazy duties, walking around the office in a way that had lately become almost habitual with him, if not quite truly characteristic, since having been described by his wife as “terrifically sexy”—a slow, catlike stride, proudly muscular but expressing a sleepy disdain of tension or hurry. And the best part of the joke was what happened every afternoon at five.

Buttoned-up and smiling among the Knox men, nodding goodnight as the elevator set him free, he would take a crosstown bus and a downtown bus to Bethune Street, where he’d mount two flights of slope-treaded, creaking stairs, open a white door so overlayed with many generations of soiled and blistered paint that its surface felt like the flesh of a toadstool, and let himself into a wide clean room that smelled faintly of cigarettes and candlewax and tangerine peel and eau de cologne; and there a beautiful, disheveled girl would be waiting, a girl as totally unlike the wife of a Knox man as the apartment was unlike a Knox man’s home. Instead of after-work cocktails they would make after-work love, sometimes on the bed and sometimes on the floor; sometimes it was ten o’clock before they roused themselves and strolled into the gentle evening streets for dinner, and by then the Knox Building could have been a thousand miles away.



By the end of the first year the joke had worn thin, and the inability of others to see the humor of it had become depressing. “Oh, you mean your father worked there,” they would say when he tried to explain it, and their eyes, as often as not, would then begin to film over with the look that people reserve for earnest, obedient, unadventurous young men. Before long (and particularly after the second year, with both his parents dead) he had stopped trying to explain that part of it, and begun to dwell instead on other comic aspects of the job: the absurd discrepancy between his own ideals and those of Knox Business Machines; the gulf between the amount of energy he was supposed to give the company and the amount he actually gave. “I mean the great advantage of a place like Knox is that you can sort of turn off your mind every morning at nine and leave it off all day, and nobody knows the difference.”

More recently still, and particularly since moving to the country, he had taken to avoiding the whole topic whenever possible by replying, to the question of what he did for a living, that he didn’t do anything, really; that he had the dullest job you could possibly imagine.

On the Monday morning after the end of the Laurel Players, he walked into the Knox Building like an automa-ton. The show windows were featuring a new display, bright cardboard images of thin, fashionable young women who grinned and pointed their pencils at emblazoned lists of product benefits—speed, accuracy, control—and beyond them, across the deep-carpeted expanse of the display floor, a generous sampling of the products themselves stood poised for demonstration. Some of them, the simpler ones, were much like the machines that had kindled his father’s enthusiasm twenty years before, though the angular black designs of those days had all been modified to fit the globular “sculptured forms” of their new casings, which were the color of oyster meat; but there were others equipped to deal with the facts of business at speeds more lickety-split than anything Earl Wheeler could have dreamed of. These, ready to purr and blink with electronic mystery, grew more and more imposing across the floor until they culminated in the big inscrutable components of the Knox “500” Electronic Computer, a machine which, according to the museum card displayed at its base, could

“perform the lifetime work of a man with a desk calculator in thirty minutes.”

But Frank moved past the display room without a glance, and his actions on entering the lobby were absent-mindedly expert: he obeyed the pointed finger of the elevator starter without quite being aware of it, nor did he notice which of the six elevator operators it was who sleepily made him welcome (he almost never did, unless it happened to be one of the two whose presence could be faintly oppressive: the very old man whose knees were so sprung that painful-looking bulges pressed against the backs of his trousers, or the enormous boy whom some glandular disorder had afflicted with the high hips of a woman and the downy head and beardless face of an infant). Pressed well back in the polite bondage of the car, he heard the sliding door clamp shut and the safety gate go rattling after it, and as the car began to rise he was surrounded by the dissonant conversations of his colleagues. He heard a deep, measured voice of the Great Plains, rich with distance and travel and the best accommodations (“. . . course, we did hit a little bumpy weather comin’ inta Chicawgo . . .”), sound out in counter-point to the abrupt and sibilant accents of the city (“. . . so I siz ‘Whaddya—kiddin’?’ He siz ‘No, listen, I’m not kiddin’ . . .”) while a softer medley of eight or ten voices, male and female, repeated their hushed morning courtesies under the buzz of the overhead fan; then it was time to begin the nodding, side-stepping ritual of making way for the people who edged toward the front with murmurs of

“Out, please . . . Out, please” and to wait while the door slid open and shut, open and shut again. The eighth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the fourteenth . . .

At first glance, all the upper floors of the Knox Building looked alike. Each was a big open room, ablaze with fluo-rescent ceiling lights, that had been divided into a maze of aisles and cubicles by shoulder-high partitions. The upper panels of these dividers, waist to shoulder, were made of thick unframed plate glass that was slightly corrugated to achieve a blue-white semi-transparency; and the overall effect of this, to a man getting off the elevator and looking out across the room, was that of the wide indoor lake in which swimmers far and near were moving, some making steady headway, some treading water, others seen in the act of breaking to the surface or going under, and many submerged, their faces loosened into wavering pink blurs as they drowned at their desks. But the illusion was quickly dispelled on walking further into the office, for here the air was of an overwhelming dryness—it was, as Frank Wheeler often complained, “enough to dry your God damned eye-balls out.”

For all his complaints, though, he was sometimes guiltily aware of taking a dim pleasure in the very discomfort of the office. When he said, as he’d been saying for years, that in a funny way he guessed he would miss old Knox when he quit, he meant of course that it was the people he would miss (“I mean hell, they’re a pretty decent crowd; some of them, anyway”) and yet in all honesty he could not have denied a homely affection for the place itself, the Fifteenth Floor. Over the years he had discovered slight sensory distinctions between it and all the others of the building; it was no more or less pleasant, but different for being “his” floor.

It was his bright, dry, daily ordeal, his personal measure of tedium. It had taught him new ways of spacing out the hours of the day—almost time to go down for coffee; almost time to go out for lunch; almost time to go home—

and he had come to rely on the desolate wastes of time that lay between these pleasures as an invalid comes to rely on the certainty of recurring pain. It was a part of him.

“Morning, Frank,” said Vince Lathrop.

“Morning, Frank,” said Ed Small.

“Morning, Mr. Wheeler,” said Grace Mancuso, who worked for Herb Underwood in Market Research.

His feet knew where to turn at the aisle marked sales promotion, and they knew how many steps would bring him past the first three cubicles and where he would have to turn again to enter the fourth; he could have done it in his sleep.

“Hello,” said Maureen Grube, who served as floor recep-tionist and worked in Mrs. Jorgensen’s typing pool. She said it in a frankly flattering, definitely feminine way, and as she swayed aside to let him pass he wanted to put his arm around her and lead her away somewhere (the mail room?

the freight elevator?) where he could sit down and take her on his lap and remove her royal blue sweater and fill his mouth with one and then the other of her breasts.

It wasn’t the first time this idea had occurred to him; the difference was that this time it had no sooner occurred to him than he thought, Why not?



His feet had led him to the entrance of the cubicle whose plastic nameplate read:

j. r. ordway

f. h. wheeler

and he paused there, one hand hooked over the rim of the plate glass, to turn and look back at her. She was all the way down to the end of the aisle, now, her buttocks moving nicely in her flannel skirt, and he watched her until she disappeared beneath the waterline of partition tops to take her place at the reception desk.

Take it easy, he counseled himself. A thing like this would need a little planning. The first thing to do, he knew, was to go on inside and say good morning to Jack Ordway and take off his coat and sit down. He did that, instantly shutting out his view of everything beyond the cubicle walls, and as he settled himself sideways at his desk with his right foot automatically toeing open a lower drawer and using its edge as a foot rest (the pressure of his shoe over the years had worn a little saddle in the edge of that particular drawer), he allowed a slow wave of delight to break over him. Why not? Hadn’t she given him every possible encouragement for months? Undulating past him in the aisle like that, bending close over his desk to hand him a folder, smiling in a special, oblique way that he’d never seen her use on anyone else? And that time at the Christmas party (he could still remember the taste of her mouth) hadn’t she trembled in his arms, and hadn’t she whispered,

“You’re sweet”?

Why not? Oh, not in the mail room or the freight elevator, but didn’t she probably have an apartment somewhere, with a roommate, and wouldn’t the roommate probably be out all day?

Jack Ordway was talking to him, requiring him against his will to look up and say “What’s that?” An intrusion by almost anyone else wouldn’t have mattered—he could have nodded and made the right replies while keeping most of his mind free for Maureen Grube—but Ordway was different.

“I said I’m going to need your help this morning, Franklin,” he was saying. “This is an emergency. I’m dead serious, old scout.” He was apparently studying a sheaf of typewritten papers on his desk, the picture of concentra-tion; only someone who knew what to look for could have told that the hand which seemed to be shading his eyes was really holding his head up, and that his eyes were shut. In his early forties, slight and trim, with the graying hair and wittily handsome face of a romantic actor, he was the kind of borderline alcoholic whose salvation seems to lie in endless renewals of his ability to laugh the whole thing off, and he was the sentimental hero of the office. Everybody loved Jack Ordway. Today he was wearing his English suit—the suit he had ordered from a touring London tailor some years before, at the cost of half a month’s salary, the suit whose cuff buttons really buttoned and whose high-backed trousers could only be worn with suspenders, or “braces,”

the suit that was never seen without a fresh linen handkerchief spilling from its breast pocket—but his long narrow feet, which lay splayed with childish awkwardness under the desk, betrayed a pitifully all-American look. They were encased in cheap orange-brown loafers, badly scuffed; and the reason for this clashing note was that the one thing Jack Ordway could not do in the grip of a really bad hangover was to tie a pair of shoelaces.



“For the next—” he was saying in a hoarse, unsteady voice, “for the next two or possibly three hours you’re to warn me of Bandy’s every approach; you’re to protect me from Mrs. Jorgensen, and you may have to screen me from public view in case I begin to throw up. It’s that bad.”

The capsuled story of Jack Ordway’s life had become a minor legend of the Fifteenth Floor: everyone knew of how he’d married a rich girl and lived on her inheritance until it vanished just before the war, how since then his business career had been spent entirely in the Knox Building, in one glass cubicle after another, and how it had been distinguished by an almost flawless lack of work. Even here in Sales Promotion, where nobody worked very hard except old Bandy, the manager, he had managed to retain his unique reputation. Except when a really bad hangover laid him low he was up and around and talking all day, setting off little choruses of laughter wherever he went, sometimes even winning a tolerant chuckle from Bandy himself, driving Mrs. Jorgensen into fits of helpless giggles that made her weep.

“First of all,” he was saying now, “on Saturday these crazy friends of Sally’s flew in from the Coast all eager for the treat. Could we show them the town? Oh, indeed we could. Old, old buddies of hers and all that, and besides, they always bring pocketfuls of loot. So. Started off with lunch at André’s, and dear God you’ve never seen such whopping great martinis in your life. Oh, and none of this sissy business of one or two apiece, either, buddy. I lost count. And then let’s see. Oh, yes. Then there was nothing to do but sit around and drink until cocktail time. Then came cocktail time.” He had abandoned his working posture now, pushed the false papers aside and leaned delicately back in the chair to hold his head with both hands; he was moving it from side to side in the rhythm of his narrative, laughing and talking through his laughter, while Frank watched him with a mixture of pity and distaste. Most of his hangover stories seemed to begin with a flying-in of Sally’s crazy friends from the Coast, or from the Bahamas, or from Europe, with pocketfuls of loot, and Sally herself was always featured at the center of the fun—the former debu-tante, the chic, childless wife and irrepressible playmate.

That, at least, was the way his listeners on the Fifteenth Floor were expected to picture her; Frank had been able to do so, and to picture their apartment as a kind of Noël Coward stage setting, until the time he went home with Ordway for a drink and found that Sally was massively soft and wrinkled, a sodden, aging woman with lips forever painted in the petulant cupid’s bow of her youth. Her every whining intonation of Jack’s name that night, as she swayed bewildered through rooms of rotting leather and dusty silver and glass, showed how deeply she blamed him for allowing the world to collapse; once she had turned up her eyes to the paint-flaked ceiling as if calling on God to punish him—this weak, foolish little man for whom she’d sacrificed her very life, who poisoned all her friendships with his endless counting of pennies, who insisted on grubbing at his dreary, dreary white-collar job and bringing dreary office people home with him. And Jack, apologetically hovering and making little jokes, had called her “Mother.”

“. . . and as for how we got back from Idlewild,” he was saying, “it’s a thing I’ll never know. My last completely clear recollection is of standing in the Idlewild lounge at three o’clock this morning and wondering if someone would please tell me how we’d gotten there in the first place. Or no, wait. After that there was something about a hamburger joint—or no, I think that was earlier . . .” When the story was over at last he removed his hands from his head, experimentally, and frowned and blinked several times. Then he announced that he was beginning to feel a little better.

“Good.” Frank dropped his foot from the drawer and got settled at his desk. He had to think, and the best way to think was to go through the motions of working. This morning’s batch of papers was waiting in his in basket, on top of last Friday’s, and so his first action was to turn the whole stack upside down on his desk and start from the bottom. As he did each day (or rather on the days when he bothered with the in basket, for there were many days when he left it alone) he tried first to see how many papers he could get rid of without actually reading their contents.

Some could be thrown away, others could be almost as rapidly disposed of by scrawling “What about this?” in their margins, with his initials, and sending them to Bandy, or by writing “Know anything on this?” and sending them to someone like Ed Small, next door; but the danger here was that the same papers might come back in a few days marked

“Do” from Bandy and “No” from Small. A safer course was to mark a thing “File” for Mrs. Jorgensen and the girls, after the briefest possible glance had established that it wasn’t of urgent importance; if it was, he might mark it

“File & Follow 1 wk.,” or he might put it aside and go on to the next one. The gradual accumulation of papers put aside in this way was what he turned to as soon as he was finished with, or tired of, the in basket. Arranging them in an approximate order of importance, he would interleave them, in the same order, with those of the six- or eight-inch stack that always lay near the center of the desk, held down by a glazed ceramic paperweight that Jennifer had made for him in kindergarten. This was his current work pile. Many of the papers in it bore the insignia of Bandy’s “Do” or Ed Small’s “No,” and some had been through the “File & Follow” cycle as many as three or four times; some, bearing notes like “Frank—might look into this,” were the gifts of men who used him as he used Small. Occasionally he would remove a piece of current work and place it in the equally high secondary pile that lay on the far right-hand corner of the desk, under a leaden scale model of the Knox “500”

Electronic Computer. This was the pile of things he couldn’t bring himself to face just now, and the worst of them, sometimes whole bulging folders filled with scrawled-over typewritten sheets and loose, sliding paper clips, would eventually go into the stuffed bottom right-hand drawer of the desk. The papers in there were of the kind that Ordway called Real Goodies, and that drawer, opposite to the one that served as a foot rest, had come to occupy a small nagging place in Frank’s conscience: he was as shy of opening it as if it held live snakes.

Why not? Wouldn’t it be perfectly easy to walk up and ask her out to lunch? No, it wouldn’t; that was the trouble.

An unspoken rule of the Fifteenth Floor divided the men from the girls on all but business matters, except at Christmas parties. The girls made separate arrangements for lunch in the same inviolable way that they used a separate lavoratory, and only a fool would openly defy the system.

This would need a little planning.

He was still in the middle of the in basket when a thin smiling face and a round solemn one appeared above the glass wall, looking in from the next cubicle. They were the faces of Vince Lathrop and Ed Small, and this meant it was time to go down for coffee.

“Gentlemen,” said Vince Lathrop. “Shall we dance?”



Half an hour later they were back in the office, having heard at some length about Ed Small’s difficulties with grass seed and lawn care in Roslyn, Long Island. The coffee had helped to strengthen Ordway, though it was clear now that what he really needed was a drink, and to prove how much better he felt he was pacing up and down the cubicle and going through his impersonation of Bandy, wobbling his head and repeatedly sucking at a side tooth with little kissing sounds.

“Well, but I wonder if we’re really being effective, that’s the thing (kiss). Because if we really want to be effective, then we’re going to have to get in there and be more, be more (kiss), be more effective . . .”

Frank was trying for the second or third time to read the top paper on his current work pile, which seemed to be a letter from the branch manager in Toledo; but its paragraphs were as opaque as if it had been typed in a foreign language. He closed his eyes and rubbed them and tried again, and this time he made it.

The branch manager in Toledo, who in the Knox tradition referred to himself as “we,” wished to know what action had been taken on his previous correspondence with regard to the many serious errors and misleading state-ments in SP-1109, a copy of which was attached. This proved to be a thick, coated-stock, four-color brochure entitled Pinpoint Your Production Control with the Knox

“500,” and the sight of it brought back uneasy memories. It had been produced many months before by a nameless copywriter in an agency that had since lost its Knox account, and had been released to the field in tens of thousands of copies marked “Address all inquiries F. H. Wheeler, Home Office.” Frank had known at the time that it was a mess—its densely printed pages defied simple logic, as well as readership, and its illustrations were only sporad-ically related to its text—but he’d let it go anyway, chiefly because Bandy had confronted him in the aisle one day with a kiss of the side tooth and said, “Haven’t we released that brochure yet?”

Since then the inquiries addressed to F. H. Wheeler had come in slow, embarrassing streams from all parts of the United States, and he was dimly aware of something particularly urgent about those that had been coming from Toledo. The next paragraph reminded him.

As you will recall, it was our intention to order 5,000 additional copies of the brochure for distribution at the annual NAPE Convention (Nat’l. Assn. of Production Executives) here June 10–13. However, as stated in previous correspondence, the brochure is in our opinion so inferior that it does not fulfill its purpose in any way, shape, or manner.

Therefore please advise immediately re our inquiry in previous correspondence, namely: what arrangements are being made to have a revised version of the brochure in our office not later than June 8 in the required number of copies?

He looked quickly at the upper left-hand corner and was relieved to find that the letter had not carried a carbon to Bandy. That was a piece of luck; but even so, this had all the earmarks of a Real Goody. Even if there were still time to arrange for a new brochure to be produced (and there probably wasn’t), he would have to clear the job through Bandy, and Bandy would want to know why he hadn’t been told about it two months earlier.

He was in the act of laying the thing on his secondary pile when the beginnings of a bright idea came through his confusion; and suddenly he was out of the cubicle and walking toward the front of the office with his heart in his mouth.

She was at her desk in the reception area with nothing to do, and when she looked up her eyes were so full of pleased expectancy—of complicity, it almost seemed—that he nearly forgot what it was he had to pretend he’d come for.

“Maureen,” he said, moving up close and taking hold of the back of her chair, “if you’re not too busy here I wonder if you’d help me find some stuff in the central file. You see this?” He laid the brochure on her desk as if it were an intimate revelation, and she leaned forward from the hips to examine it, so that her breasts swung close to his pointing hand.

“Mm?”

“The thing is, it’s got to be revised. That means I’ve got to dig up all the material that went into it, right from scratch. Now, if you’ll look in the inactive file under SP-1109 you’ll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency; then if you check each of those papers you’ll find another code number referring you to other files; that way we can trace the thing back to original sources. Come on, I’ll help you get started.”

“All right.”

As he moved up the aisle behind her hips he felt the promise of triumph in his expanding chest, and soon they were alone together in the labyrinth of the central file, enveloped in her perfume as they fingered nervously through a drawer of folders.

“Eleven-oh-what, did you say?”

“Eleven-oh-nine. Should be right there somewhere.”

For the first time he allowed himself to scrutinize her face. It was round and wide-nosed and not really very pretty—he could afford to admit that now—and its too-heavy make-up was probably there to hide a bad complexion, just as the little black tails she had drawn at the corners of her eyes were there to make the eyes look larger and far-ther apart. Her carefully arranged hair was probably her greatest problem—it must have been a shapeless frizzled bush when she was a child, and must still give her trouble in the rain—but her mouth was wonderful: perfect teeth and plump, subtly shaped lips that had the texture of marzipan.

He found that if he focused his eyes on her mouth so that the rest of her face was slightly blurred, and then drew back to include the whole length and shape of her in that hazy image, it was possible to believe he was looking at the most desirable woman in the world.

“Here,” she said. “Now, you want all the folders relating to all these other code numbers. Is that it?”

“That’s it. It may take a little time; I hope you weren’t planning on an early lunch.”

“No. I didn’t have any special plans.”

“Good. I’ll stop back in a while and see how you’re doing. Thanks a lot, Maureen.”

“You’re very welcome.”

And he went back to his cubicle and sat down. It was a perfect arrangement. He could wait here until the rest of the floor had emptied out for lunch; then he would go back and get her. His only problem now was to think up an excuse for not going out to lunch in the usual way, with the usual crowd—an excuse, if possible, that would cover him for the rest of the afternoon.

“Eat?” a deep masculine voice inquired, and this time three heads hung above the partition. They were the heads of Lathrop, Small, and the man who had spoken, a gray mountain of a man with heavy eyebrows and a clenched pipe, whose bulk rose high enough above the glass to reveal that he wore a defiantly unbusinesslike checked shirt, hairy wool tie and pepper-and-salt jacket. This was Sid Roscoe, the literary and political sage of the Fifteenth Floor, a self-described “old newspaper guy” who contemptuously edited the employee house organ, Knox Knews. “Come on, you characters,” he said heartily. “On your feet.”

Jack Ordway obeyed him, pausing only to murmur

“Ready, Franklin?” But Frank held back, inspecting his watch with the look of a man pressed for time.

“Guess I won’t be able to make it today,” he said. “Got some people to see uptown this afternoon; I’ll probably stop for a bite up there.”

“Oh, for God’s sake, Wheeler,” Ordway said, turning on him. There was a disproportionate amount of shock and disappointment in his face, a look of But you’ve got to come with us; and it took Frank a second to realize what the trouble was. Ordway needed him. With Frank along for moral support, it would be possible to steer the group to what Ordway called the Nice place, the dark German restaurant where a round of weak but adequate martinis came floating to your table almost as a matter of course; without him, under Roscoe’s leadership, they would almost certainly go to the Awful place—a bright, mercilessly clean luncheonette called Waffle Heaven where you couldn’t even get a glass of beer and where the cloying smells of melting butter and maple syrup were enough to make you retch into your tiny paper napkin. There would then be nothing for Jack Ordway to do but sit and hold himself together until they brought him back to the office and set him free to slip out again for the couple of quick ones he would need to survive the afternoon. Please, his comically round eyes implored as they led him away, please don’t let this happen to me.

But Frank sat firm, thumbing the edges of his current work file. He waited until they were safely in the elevator, and then he continued to wait. Ten minutes went by, and twenty, and still the office seemed much too crowded; then at last he half rose from his chair and peeked out over the surface of the partition-tops in all directions.

Maureen’s head moved alone above the waterline of the central file. There were a few other heads bunched near the elevators and a few others scattered in far corners, but there was no point in waiting any longer. The office would never be emptier than this. He buttoned his coat and stalked out of the cubicle.

“That’s fine, Maureen,” he said, bearing down on her and taking the batch of folders and papers from her hand. “I don’t think we’ll need any more than that.”

“Well, but it’s only about half the stuff, though. I mean didn’t you want all of it?”

“Tell you what: let’s not worry about it. How about some lunch?”

“All right. I’d love to.”

He was all action as he hurried back to his desk to drop the papers and dodged into the men’s room to wash up, but when he went to stand by the elevators, waiting for her to come out of the ladies’ room, he was all worry. The small crowd around the elevators was beginning to include people coming back from lunch; if she didn’t hurry up they might run into Ordway and the others. What the hell was she doing in there? Standing with her arms around three other girls in a paralysis of laughter at the very idea of going out with Mr. Wheeler?

Then suddenly she was walking toward him in a light coat, and the elevator door was sliding open and the operator’s voice was saying “Down!”

He stood a little behind her and held himself in a rigid parade rest as they dropped through space. All the restaurants for blocks around would be loaded with Knox people; he would have to get her out of the neighborhood, and as they moved through the lobby he touched her elbow as hesitantly as if it were her breast. “Listen,” he mumbled.

“There aren’t any decent places to eat around here. You mind taking a short trip?”

They were out on the sidewalk now, jostled by the crowd, and he stood smiling like an idiot for what seemed a full minute of indecision before the word “taxi” popped into his head; then all at once it made him feel so fine to see one slowing down under the command of his wagging arm, and so splendid to see her smile and bend and climb gracefully into its deep seat, that he didn’t give a damn about what he saw from the corner of his eye at that moment: the unmistakable bulk of Sid Roscoe in the crowd, flanked by the familiar shapes of Lathrop and Small and Ordway, coming from the direction of the Awful place. It was impossible to tell whether they’d seen him or not, and he instantly decided that it didn’t matter. He slammed the door and allowed himself one more glance through the window of the cab as it pulled away from the curb, and he wanted to laugh aloud at the sight of Jack Ordway’s orange loafers flapping along through the forest of legs and feet.
