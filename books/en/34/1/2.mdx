title: TWO

franklin h. wheeler was among the few who bucked the current. He did so with apologetic slowness and with what he hoped was dignity, making his way in sidling steps down the aisle toward the stage door, saying “Excuse me . . .

Excuse me,” nodding and smiling to several faces he knew, carrying one hand in his pocket to conceal and dry the knuckles he had sucked and bitten throughout the play.

He was neat and solid, a few days less than thirty years old, with closely cut black hair and the kind of unemphatic good looks that an advertising photographer might use to portray the discerning consumer of well-made but inexpensive merchandise (Why Pay More?). But for all its lack of structural distinction, his face did have an unusual mobility: it was able to suggest wholly different personalities with each flickering change of expression. Smiling, he was a man who knew perfectly well that the failure of an amateur play was nothing much to worry about, a kindly, witty man who would have exactly the right words of comfort for his wife backstage; but in the intervals between his smiles, when he shouldered ahead through the crowd and you could see the faint chronic fever of bewilderment in his eyes, it seemed more that he himself was in need of comforting.

The trouble was that all afternoon in the city, stultified at what he liked to call “the dullest job you can possibly imagine,” he had drawn strength from a mental projection of scenes to unfold tonight: himself rushing home to swing his children laughing in the air, to gulp a cocktail and chatter through an early dinner with his wife; himself driving her to the high school, with her thigh tense and warm under his reassuring hand (“If only I weren’t so nervous, Frank!”); himself sitting spellbound in pride and then rising to join a thunderous ovation as the curtain fell; himself glowing and disheveled, pushing his way through jubilant backstage crowds to claim her first tearful kiss (“Was it really good, darling? Was it really good?”); and then the two of them, stopping for a drink in the admiring company of Shep and Milly Campbell, holding hands under the table while they talked it all out. Nowhere in these plans had he foreseen the weight and shock of reality; nothing had warned him that he might be overwhelmed by the swaying, shining vision of a girl he hadn’t seen in years, a girl whose every glance and gesture could make his throat fill up with long-ing ( “Wouldn’t you like to be loved by me?” ), and that then before his very eyes she would dissolve and change into the graceless, suffering creature whose existence he tried every day of his life to deny but whom he knew as well and as painfully as he knew himself, a gaunt constricted woman whose red eyes flashed reproach, whose false smile in the curtain call was as homely as his own sore feet, his own damp climbing underwear and his own sour smell.



At the door he paused to withdraw and examine the pink-blotched hand from his pocket, half expecting to find it torn to a pulp of blood and gristle. Then, pulling his coat straight, he went through the door and up the steps into a high dusty chamber filled with the raw glare and deep shadows cast by naked light bulbs, where the Laurel Players, ablaze with cosmetics, stood talking to their sallow visitors in nervous, widely spaced groups of two and three around the floor. She wasn’t there.

“No, I mean seriously,” somebody was saying. “Could you hear me, or not?” And somebody else said, “Well, hell, it was a lot of fun anyway.” The director, in a scanty cluster of his New York friends, was pulling hungrily on a cigarette and shaking his head. Shep Campbell, pebbled with sweat, still holding his Tommy gun but clearly himself again, was standing near the curtain rope with his free arm around his small, rumpled wife, and they were both demonstrating their decision to laugh the whole thing off.

“Frank?” Milly Campbell had waved and risen on tiptoe to shout his name through cupped hands, as if pretending that the crowd were thicker and noisier than it really was.

“Frank! We’ll see you and April later, okay? For a drink?”

“Fine!” he called back. “Couple of minutes!” And he winked and nodded as Shep raised his machine gun in a comic salute.

Around the corner he found one of the lesser gangsters talking with a plump girl who had caused a thirty-second rupture in the first act by missing her entrance cue, who had evidently been crying but now was hilariously pound-ing her temple and saying “God! I could’ve killed myself!”

while the gangster, tremulously wiping grease paint from his mouth, said “No, but I mean it was a lot of fun anyway, you know what I mean? That’s the main thing, in a thing like this.”

“Excuse me,” Frank Wheeler said, squeezing past them to the door of the dressing room that his wife shared with several other women. He knocked and waited, and when he thought he heard her say “Come in,” he opened it tentatively and peeked inside.

She was alone, sitting very straight at a mirror and removing her make-up. Her eyes were still red and blinking, but she gave him a small replica of her curtain-call smile before turning back to the mirror. “Hi,” she said.

“You ready to leave?”

He closed the door and started toward her with the corners of his mouth stretched tight in a look that he hoped would be full of love and humor and compassion; what he planned to do was bend down and kiss her and say “Listen: you were wonderful.” But an almost imperceptible recoil of her shoulders told him that she didn’t want to be touched, which left him uncertain what to do with his hands, and that was when it occurred to him that “You were wonderful”

might be exactly the wrong thing to say—condescending, or at the very least naive and sentimental, and much too serious.

“Well,” he said instead. “I guess it wasn’t exactly a triumph or anything, was it?” And he stuck a cigarette jauntily in his lips and lit it with a flourish of his clicking Zippo.

“I guess not,” she said. “I’ll be ready in a minute.”

“No, that’s okay, take your time.”

He pocketed both hands and curled the tired toes inside his shoes, looking down at them. Would “You were wonderful” have been a better thing to say, after all? Almost anything, it now seemed, would have been a better thing to say than what he’d said. But he would have to think of better things to say later; right now it was all he could do to stand here and think about the double bourbon he would have when they stopped on the way home with the Campbells. He looked at himself in the mirror, tightening his jaw and turning his head a little to one side to give it a leaner, more commanding look, the face he had given himself in mirrors since boyhood and which no photograph had ever quite achieved, until with a start he found that she was watching him. Her own eyes were there in the mirror, trained on his for an uncomfortable moment before she lowered them to stare at the middle button of his coat.

“Listen,” she said. “Will you do me a favor? The thing is—” It seemed that all the slender strength of her back was needed to keep her voice from wavering. “The thing is, Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards.

Will you say we can’t? Say it’s because of the baby sitter, or something?”

He moved well away and stood stiff-legged and hump-shouldered, hands in his pockets, like a stage lawyer considering a fine point of ethics. “Well,” he said, “the thing is, I already said we could. I mean I just saw them out there and I said we would.”

“Oh. Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough.”

“Look,” he said. “Don’t start getting this way. The point is I thought it might be fun, is all. Besides, it’s going to look kind of rude, isn’t it? I mean isn’t it?”

“You mean you won’t.” She closed her eyes. “All right, I will, then. Thanks a lot.” Her face in the mirror, nude and shining with cold cream, looked forty years old and as hag-gard as if it were set to endure a physical pain.

“Wait a second,” he told her. “Take it easy, will you please? I didn’t say that. I just said they’re going to think it’s damn rude, that’s all. And they are. I can’t help that.”

“All right. You go along with them, if you want to, and give me the car keys.”

“Oh, Jesus, don’t start this business about the car keys.

Why do you always have to—”

“Look, Frank.” Her eyes were still shut. “I’m not going out with those people. I don’t happen to feel very well, and I—”

“Okay.” He was backing away, holding out both stiff trembling hands like a man intently describing the length of a short fish. “Okay. Okay. I’m sorry. I’ll tell them. I’ll be right back. I’m sorry.”

The floor rode under his feet like the deck of a moving ship as he made his way back to the wings, where a man was taking pictures with a miniature flash camera (“Hold it now—that’s fine. That’s fine”) and the actor who played Gabrielle’s father was telling the plump girl, who looked ready to cry again, that the only thing to do was write the whole thing off to experience.

“You folks about ready?” Shep Campbell demanded.

“Well,” Frank said, “actually, I’m afraid we’ll have to cut out. April promised this baby sitter we’d be home early, you see, and we really—”

Both their faces sagged in hurt and disappointment.

Milly drew a section of her lower lip between her teeth and slowly released it. “Gee,” she said. “I guess April feels awful about this whole thing, doesn’t she? Poor kid.”

“No, no, she’s okay,” he told them. “Really, it’s not that.

She’s okay. It’s just this business of the baby sitter, you see.”

It was the first lie of its kind in the two years of their friendship, and it caused them all three to look at the floor as they labored through a halting ritual of smiles and goodnights; but it couldn’t be helped.



She was waiting for him in the dressing room, ready with a pleasant social face for any of the Laurel Players they might happen to meet on the way out, but they managed to avoid them all. She led him through a side door that opened onto fifty yards of empty, echoing high-school corridor and they walked without touching each other and without speaking, moving in and out of the oblongs of moonlight that lay on the marble floor.

The smell of school in the darkness, pencils and apples and library paste, brought a sweet nostalgic pain to his eyes and he was fourteen again, and it was the year he’d lived in Chester, Pennsylvania—no, in Englewood, New Jersey—

and spent all his free time in a plan for riding the rails to the West Coast. He had traced several alternate routes on a railroad map, he had rehearsed many times the way he would handle himself (politely, but with fist fights if necessary) in the hobo jungles along the way, and he’d chosen all the items of his wardrobe from the window of an Army and Navy store: Levi jacket and pants, an army-type khaki shirt with shoulder tabs, high-cut work shoes with steel caps at heel and toe. An old felt hat of his father’s, which could be made to fit with a wad of newspaper folded into its sweat-band, would lend the right note of honest poverty to the outfit, and he could take whatever else he needed in his Boy Scout knapsack, artfully reinforced with adhesive tape to conceal the Boy Scout emblem. The best thing about the plan was its absolute secrecy, until the day in the school corridor when he impulsively asked a fat boy named Krebs, who was the closest thing to a best friend he had that year, to go along with him. Krebs was dumfounded—“On a freight train, you mean?”—and soon he was laughing aloud.

“Jeez, you kill me, Wheeler. How far do you think you’d get on a freight train? Where do you get these weird ideas, anyway? The movies or someplace? You want to know something, Wheeler? You want to know why everybody thinks you’re a jerk? Because you’re a jerk, that’s why.”

Walking now through the same smells and looking at the pale shape of April’s profile as she walked beside him, he allowed his rising sense of poignance to encompass her as well, and the sadness of her own childhood. He wasn’t often able to do this, for most of her memories were crisply told and hard to sentimentalize (“I always knew nobody cared about me and I always let everybody know I knew it”), but the school smell made him think of one particular time she had told about, a morning in Rye Country Day when a menstrual flow of unusual suddenness and volume had taken her by surprise in the middle of a class. “At first I just sat there,” she’d told him. “That was the stupid thing; and then it was too late.” And he thought of how she must have lurched from her desk and run from the room with a red stain the size of a maple leaf on the seat of her white linen skirt while thirty boys and girls looked up in dumb surprise, how she must have fled down the corridor in a nightmarish silence past the doors of other murmuring classrooms, spilling books and picking them up and running again, leaving a tidy, well-spaced trail of blood drops on the floor, how she had run to the first-aid room and been afraid to go inside, how instead she had run all the way down another corridor to a fire-exit door, where she pulled off her cardi-gan and tied it around her waist and hips; how then, hearing or imagining the approach of footsteps in her wake, she had pushed through to the sunny lawn outside and set off for home, walking not too quickly and with her head high, so that anyone happening to glance from any of a hundred windows would think her on some perfectly normal errand from school, wearing her sweater in a perfectly normal way.



Her face must have looked almost exactly the way it did now, as they opened this other fire-exit door and walked out across these other school grounds not many miles from Rye, and her way of walking must have been similar too.

He had hoped she would sit close to him in the car—he wanted to hold her shoulders while he drove—but she made herself very small and pressed against the passenger’s door, turning away to watch the passing lights and shadows of the road. This caused his eyes to grow round and his mouth solemn as he steered and shifted gears, until finally, licking his lips, he thought of something to say.

“You know something? You were the only person in that whole play. No kidding, April. I mean it.”

“All right,” she said. “Thank you.”

“It’s just that we never should’ve let you get mixed up in the damned thing, is all.” With his free hand he opened his collar, both to cool his neck and to find reassurance in the grown-up, sophisticated feel of the silk tie and Oxford shirt.

“I’d just like to get my hands on that what’s his name, that’s all. That director.”

“It wasn’t his fault.”

“Well, the whole pack of them, then. God knows they all stank. The whole point is we should’ve known better in the first place. I should’ve known better, is what it amounts to.

You never would’ve joined the damn group if the Campbells and I hadn’t talked you into it. Remember when we first heard about it? And you said they’d probably turn out to be a bunch of idiots? Well, I should’ve listened to you, that’s all.”

“All right. Could we sort of stop talking about it now?”

“Sure we will.” He tried to pat her thigh but it was out of reach across the wide seat. “Sure we will. I just don’t want you feeling bad about it, that’s all.”

With a confident, fluid grace he steered the car out of the bouncing side road and onto the hard clean straightaway of Route Twelve, feeling that his attitude was on solid ground at last. A refreshing wind rushed in to ruffle his short hair and cool his brains, and he began to see the fiasco of the Laurel Players in its true perspective. It simply wasn’t worth feeling bad about. Intelligent, thinking people could take things like this in their stride, just as they took the larger absurdities of deadly dull jobs in the city and deadly dull homes in the suburbs. Economic circumstance might force you to live in this environment, but the important thing was to keep from being contaminated. The important thing, always, was to remember who you were.

And now, as it often did in the effort to remember who he was, his mind went back to the first few years after the war and to a crumbling block of Bethune Street, in that part of New York where the gentle western edge of the Village flakes off into silent waterfront warehouses, where the salt breeze of evening and the deep river horns of night enrich the air with a promise of voyages. In his very early twenties, wearing the proud mantles of “veteran” and “intellectual”

as bravely as he wore his carefully aged tweed jacket and washed-out khakis, he had owned one of three keys to a one-room apartment on that street. The other two keys, and rights to “the use of the place” every second and third week, had belonged to two of his Columbia College class-mates, each of whom paid a third of its twenty-seven-dollar rent. These other two, an ex-fighter pilot and an ex-marine, were older and more relaxed in their worldliness than Frank—they seemed able to draw on endless reserves of willing girls with whom to use the place—but it wasn’t long before Frank, to his own shy amazement, began to catch up with them; that was a time of wondrously rapid catching-up in many ways, of dizzily mounting self-confidence. The solitary tracer of railroad maps had never hopped his freight, but it had begun to seem unlikely that any Krebs would ever call him a jerk again. The army had taken him at eighteen, had thrust him into the final spring offensive of the war in Germany and given him a confused but exhilarating tour of Europe for another year before it set him free, and life since then had carried him from strength to strength. Loose strands of his character—the very traits that had kept him dreaming and lonely among schoolboys and later among soldiers—these seemed suddenly to have coalesced into a substantial and attractive whole. For the first time in his life he was admired, and the fact that girls could actually want to go to bed with him was only slightly more remarkable than his other concurrent discovery—

that men, and intelligent men at that, could actually want to listen to him talk. His marks at school were seldom better than average, but there was nothing average about his performance in the beery, all-night talks that had begun to form around him—talks that would often end in a general murmur of agreement, accompanied by a significant tapping of temples, that old Wheeler really had it. All he would ever need, it was said, was the time and the freedom to find himself. Various ultimate careers were predicted for him, the consensus being that his work would lie somewhere “in the humanities” if not precisely in the arts—it would, at any rate, be something that called for a long and steadfast dedication—and that it would involve his early and permanent withdrawal to Europe, which he often described as the only part of the world worth living in. And Frank himself, walking the streets at daybreak after some of those talks, or lying and thinking on Bethune Street on nights when he had the use of the place but had no girl to use it with, hardly ever entertained a doubt of his own exceptional merit. Weren’t the biographies of all great men filled with this same kind of youthful groping, this same kind of rebellion against their fathers and their fathers’

ways? He could even be grateful in a sense that he had no particular area of interest: in avoiding specific goals he had avoided specific limitations. For the time being the world, life itself, could be his chosen field.

But as college wore on he began to be haunted by numberless small depressions, and these tended to increase in the weeks after college was over, when the other two men had taken to using their keys less and less frequently and he was staying alone in the Bethune Street place, taking odd jobs to buy his food while he thought things out. It nagged him, in particular, that none of the girls he’d known so far had given him a sense of unalloyed triumph. One had been very pretty except for unpardonably thick ankles, and one had been intelligent, though possessed of an annoying tendency to mother him, but he had to admit that none had been first-rate. Nor was he ever in doubt of what he meant by a first-rate girl, though he’d never yet come close enough to one to touch her hand. There had been two or three of them in the various high schools he’d attended, disdainfully unaware of him in their concern with college boys from out of town; what few he’d seen in the army had most often been seen in flickering miniature, on strains of dance music, through the distant golden windows of an officers’ club, and though he’d seen plenty of them since then, in New York, they had always been climbing in or out of taxicabs, followed by the grimly hovering presences of men who looked as if they’d never been boys at all.

Why not let well enough alone? As an intense, nicotine-stained, Jean-Paul Sartre sort of man, wasn’t it simple logic to expect that he’d be limited to intense, nicotine-stained, Jean-Paul Sartre sorts of women? But this was the counsel of defeat, and one night, bolstered by four straight gulps of whiskey at a party in Morningside Heights, he followed the counsel of victory. “I guess I didn’t get your name,” he said to the exceptionally first-rate girl whose shining hair and splendid legs had drawn him halfway across a roomful of strangers. “Are you Pamela?”

“No,” she said. “That’s Pamela over there. I’m April.

April Johnson.”

Within five minutes he found he could make April Johnson laugh, that he could not only hold the steady attention of her wide gray eyes but could make their pupils dart up and down and around in little arcs while he talked to her, as if the very shape and texture of his face were matters of absorbing interest.

“What do you do?”

“I’m a longshoreman.”

“No, I mean really.”

“I mean really too.” And he would have showed her his palms to prove it if he hadn’t been afraid she could tell the difference between calluses and blisters. For the past week, under the guidance of a roughhewn college friend, he had been self-consciously “shaping up” on the docks each morning and swaying under the weight of fruit crates.

“Starting Monday, though, I’ve got a better job. Night cashier in a cafeteria.”

“Well but I don’t mean things like that. I mean what are you really interested in?”

“Honey—” (and he was still young enough so that the audacity of saying “Honey” on such short acquaintance made him blush) “—Honey, if I had the answer to that one I bet I’d bore us both to death in half an hour.”



Five minutes later, dancing, he found that the small of April Johnson’s back rode as neatly in his hand as if it had been made for that purpose; and a week after that, almost to the day, she was lying miraculously nude beside him in the first blue light of day on Bethune Street, drawing her delicate forefinger down his face from brow to chin and whispering: “It’s true, Frank. I mean it. You’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met.”

“Because it’s just not worth it,” he was saying now, allowing the blue-lit needle of the speedometer to tremble up through sixty for the final mile of highway. They were almost home. They would have a few drinks and maybe she would cry a little—it would do her good—and then they would laugh about it and shut themselves in the bedroom and take off their clothes, and in the moonlight her plump little breasts would nod and sway and point at him, and there wasn’t any reason why it couldn’t be like the old days.

“I mean it’s bad enough having to live among all these damn little suburban types—and I’m including the Campbells in that, let’s be honest—it’s bad enough having to live among these people, without letting ourselves get hurt by every little half-assed—what’d you say?” He glanced briefly away from the road and was startled to see, by the light of the dashboard, that she was covering her face with both hands.

“I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just please stop talking now, before you drive me crazy?”

He slowed down quickly and brought the car to a sandy halt on the shoulder of the road, cutting the engine and the lights. Then he slid across the seat and tried to take her in his arms.

“No, Frank, please don’t do that. Just leave me alone, okay?”



“Baby, it’s only that I want to—”

“Leave me alone. Leave me alone!”

He drew himself back to the wheel and put the lights on, but his hands refused to undertake the job of starting the car. Instead he sat there for a minute, listening to the beating of blood in his eardrums.

“It strikes me,” he said at last, “that there’s a considerable amount of bullshit going on here. I mean you seem to be doing a pretty good imitation of Madame Bovary here, and there’s one or two points I’d like to clear up. Number one, it’s not my fault the play was lousy. Number two, it’s sure as hell not my fault you didn’t turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we’re all going to be. Number three, I don’t happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you’ve been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved out here, and I’m damned if I’ll wear it. Number four—”

She was out of the car and running away in the head-lights, quick and graceful, a little too wide in the hips. For a second, as he clambered out and started after her, he thought she meant to kill herself—she was capable of damn near anything at times like this—but she stopped in the dark roadside weeds thirty yards ahead, beside a luminous sign that read no passing. He came up behind her and stood uncertainly, breathing hard, keeping his distance. She wasn’t crying; she was only standing there, with her back to him.

“What the hell,” he said. “What the hell’s this all about?

Come on back to the car.”

“No. I will in a minute. Just let me stand here a minute, all right?”



His arms flapped and fell; then, as the sound and the lights of an approaching car came up behind them, he put one hand in his pocket and assumed a conversational slouch for the sake of appearances. The car overtook them, lighting up the sign and the tense shape of her back; then its taillights sped away and the drone of its tires flattened out to a buzz in the distance, and finally to silence. On their right, in a black marsh, the spring peepers were in full and desperate song. Straight ahead, two or three hundred yards away, the earth rose high above the moonlit telephone wires to form the mound of Revolutionary Hill, along whose sum-mit winked the friendly picture windows of the Revolutionary Hill Estates. The Campbells lived in one of those houses; the Campbells might well be in one of the cars whose lights were coming up behind them right now.

“April?”

She didn’t answer.

“Look,” he said. “Couldn’t we sit in the car and talk about it? Instead of running all over Route Twelve?”

“Haven’t I made it clear,” she said, “that I don’t particularly want to talk about it?”

“Okay,” he said. “Okay. Jesus, April, I’m trying as hard as I can to be nice about this thing, but I—”

“How kind of you,” she said. “How terribly, terribly kind of you.”

“Wait a minute—” he pulled the hand from his pocket and stood straight, but then he put it back because other cars were coming. “Listen a minute.” He tried to swallow but his throat was very dry. “I don’t know what you’re trying to prove here,” he said, “and frankly I don’t think you do either. But I do know one thing. I know damn well I don’t deserve this.”



“You’re always so wonderfully definite, aren’t you,” she said, “on the subject of what you do and don’t deserve.” She swept past him and walked back to the car.

“Now, wait a minute!” He was stumbling after her in the weeds. Other cars were rushing past now, both ways, but he’d stopped caring. “Wait a minute, God damn it!”

She leaned the backs of her thighs against the fender and folded her arms in an elaborate display of resignation while he jabbed and shook a forefinger in her face.

“You listen to me. This is one time you’re not going to get away with twisting everything I say. This just happens to be one damn time I know I’m not in the wrong. You know what you are when you’re like this?”

“Oh God, if only you’d stayed home tonight.”

“You know what you are when you’re like this? You’re sick. I really mean that.”

“And do you know what you are?” Her eyes raked him up and down. “You’re disgusting.”

Then the fight went out of control. It quivered their arms and legs and wrenched their faces into shapes of hatred, it urged them harder and deeper into each other’s weakest points, showing them cunning ways around each other’s strongholds and quick chances to switch tactics, feint, and strike again. In the space of a gasp for breath it sent their memories racing back over the years for old weapons to rip the scabs off old wounds; it went on and on.

“Oh, you’ve never fooled me, Frank, never once. All your precious moral maxims and your ‘love’ and your mealy-mouthed little—do you think I’ve forgotten the time you hit me in the face because I said I wouldn’t forgive you?

Oh, I’ve always known I had to be your conscience and your guts— and your punching bag. Just because you’ve got me safely in a trap you think you—”



“You in a trap! You in a trap! Jesus, don’t make me laugh!”

“Yes, me.” She made a claw of her hand and clutched at her collarbone. “Me. Me. Me. Oh, you poor, self-deluded— Look at you! Look at you, and tell me how by any stretch”—she tossed her head, and the grin of her teeth glistened white in the moonlight—“by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!”

He swung out one trembling fist for a backhanded blow to her head and she cowered against the fender in an ugly crumple of fear; then instead of hitting her he danced away in a travesty of boxer’s footwork and brought the fist down on the roof of the car with all his strength. He hit the car four times that way: Bong! Bong! Bong! Bong! —while she stood and watched. When he was finished, the shrill, liquid chant of the peepers was the only sound for miles.

“God damn you,” he said quietly. “God damn you, April.”

“All right. Could we please go home now?”

With parched, hard-breathing mouths, with wobbling heads and shaking limbs, they settled themselves in the car like very old and tired people. He started the engine and drove carefully away, down to the turn at the base of Revolutionary Hill and on up the winding blacktop grade of Revolutionary Road.

This was the way they had first come, two years ago, as cordially nodding passengers in the station wagon of Mrs.

Helen Givings, the real-estate broker. She had been polite but guarded over the phone—so many city people were apt to come out and waste her time demanding impossible bargains—but from the moment they’d stepped off the train, as she would later tell her husband, she had recognized them as the kind of couple one did take a little trouble with, even in the low-price bracket. “They’re sweet, ” she told her husband. “The girl is ab solutely ravishing, and I think the boy must do something very brilliant in town—he’s very nice, rather reserved—and really, it is so refreshing to deal with people of that sort.” Mrs. Givings had understood at once that they wanted something out of the ordinary—a small remodeled barn or carriage house, or an old guest cottage—something with a little charm—and she did hate having to tell them that those things simply weren’t available any more. But she implored them not to lose heart; she did know of one little place they might like.

“Now of course it isn’t a very desirable road down at this end,” she explained, her glance switching birdlike between the road and their pleased, attentive faces as she made the turn off Route Twelve. “As you see, it’s mostly these little cinder-blocky, pickup-trucky places—plumbers, carpen-ters, little local people of that sort. And then eventually”—

she aimed the stiff pistol of her index finger straight through the windshield in fair warning, causing a number of metal bracelets to jingle and click against the steering wheel—“eventually it leads on up and around to a perfectly dreadful new development called Revolutionary Hill Estates—great hulking split levels, all in the most nauseous pastels and dreadfully expensive too, I can’t think why. No, but the place I want to show you has absolutely no connection with that. One of our nice little local builders put it up right after the war, you see, before all the really awful building began. It’s really rather a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It’s right around this next curve, and you see the road is nicer along in here, isn’t it? Now you’ll see it—

there. See the little white one? Sweet, isn’t it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope?”



“Oh yes,” April said as the house emerged through the spindly trunks of second-growth oak and slowly turned toward them, small and wooden, riding high on its naked concrete foundation, its outsized central window staring like a big black mirror. “Yes, I think it’s sort of—nice, don’t you, darling? Of course it does have the picture window; I guess there’s no escaping that.”

“I guess not,” Frank said. “Still, I don’t suppose one picture window is necessarily going to destroy our personalities.”

“Oh, that’s marvelous, ” Mrs. Givings cried, and her laughter enclosed them in a warm shelter of flattery as they rolled up the driveway and climbed out to have a look. She hovered near them, reassuring and protective, while they walked the naked floors of the house in whispering specula-tion. The place did have possibilities. Their sofa could go here and their big table there; their solid wall of books would take the curse off the picture window; a sparse, skillful arrangement of furniture would counteract the prim suburban look of this too-symmetrical living room. On the other hand, the very symmetry of the place was undeniably appealing—the fact that all its corners made right angles, that each of its floorboards lay straight and true, that its doors hung in perfect balance and closed without scraping in efficient clicks. Enjoying the light heft and feel of these doorknobs, they could fancy themselves at home here.

Inspecting the flawless bathroom, they could sense the pleasure of steaming in its ample tub; they could see their children running barefoot down this hallway free of mildew and splinters and cockroaches and grit. It did have possibilities. The gathering disorder of their lives might still be sorted out and made to fit these rooms, among these trees; and what if it did take time? Who could be frightened in as wide and bright, as clean and quiet a house as this?

Now, as the house swam up close in the darkness with its cheerful blaze of kitchen and carport lights, they tensed their shoulders and set their jaws in attitudes of brute endurance. April went first, swaying blindly through the kitchen, pausing to steady herself against the great refrigerator, and Frank came blinking behind her. Then she touched a wall switch, and the living room exploded into clarity. In the first shock of light it seemed to be floating, all its contents adrift, and even after it held still it had a tentative look. The sofa was here and the big table there, but they might just as well have been reversed; there was the wall of books, obediently competing for dominance with the picture window, but it might as well have been a lending library. The other pieces of furniture had indeed removed the suggestion of primness, but they had failed to replace it with any other quality. Chairs, coffee table, floor lamp and desk, they stood like items arbitrarily grouped for auction.

Only one corner of the room showed signs of pleasant human congress—carpet worn, cushions dented, ash trays full—and this was the alcove they had established with reluctance less than six months ago: the province of the television set (“Why not? Don’t we really owe it to the kids? Besides, it’s silly to go on being snobbish about television . . .”).

Mrs. Lundquist, the baby sitter, had fallen asleep on the sofa and lay hidden beneath its back. Now she rose abruptly into view as she sat up squinting and trying to smile, her false teeth clacking and her hands fumbling at the pins of her loosened white hair.

“Mommy?” came a high wide-awake voice from the children’s room down the hall. It was Jennifer, the six-year-old.

“Mommy? Was it a good play?”

Frank took two wrong turns in driving Mrs. Lundquist home (Mrs. Lundquist, lurching against door and dashboard, tried to cover her fear by smiling fixedly in the darkness; she thought he was drunk), and all the way back, alone, he rode with one hand pressed to his mouth. He was doing his best to reconstruct the quarrel in his mind, but it was hopeless. He couldn’t even tell whether he was angry or contrite, whether it was forgiveness he wanted or the power to forgive. His throat was still raw from shouting and his hand still throbbed from hitting the car—he remembered that part well enough—but his only other memory was of the high-shouldered way she had stood in the curtain call, with that false, vulnerable smile, and this made him weak with remorse. Of all the nights to have a fight! He had to hold the wheel tight in both hands because the road lights were blurring and swimming in his eyes.

The house was dark, and the sight of it as he drove up, a long milky shape in the greater darkness of trees and sky, made him think of death. He padded quickly through the kitchen and living room and went down the hall on careful tiptoe, past the children’s room and into the bedroom, where he softly shut the door behind him.

“April, listen,” he whispered. Stripping off his coat, he went to the dim bed and sat slumped on its edge in a classic pose of contrition. “Please listen. I won’t touch you. I just want to say I’m—there isn’t anything to say except I’m sorry.”

This was going to be a bad one; it was going to be the kind that went on for days. But at least they were here, alone and quiet in their own room, instead of shouting on the highway; at least the thing had passed into its second phase now, the long quiet aftermath that always before, however implausibly, had led to reconciliation. She wouldn’t run away from him now, nor was there any chance of his boiling into a rage again; they were both too tired. Early in his marriage these numb periods had seemed even worse than the humiliating noise that set them off: each time he would think, There can’t be any dignified way out of it this time. But there always had been a way, dignified or not, discovered through the simple process of apologizing first and then waiting, trying not to think about it too much. By now the feel of this attitude was as familiar as an unbecoming, comfortable old coat. He could wear it with a certain voluptuous ease, for it allowed him a total suspension of will and pride.

“I don’t know what happened back there,” he said, “but whatever it was, believe me, I—April?” Then his reaching hand discovered that the bed was empty. The long shape he’d been talking to was a wad of thrown-back covers and a pillow; she had torn the bed apart.

“April?”

He ran frightened to the empty bathroom and down the hall.

“Please go away,” her voice said. She was rolled up in a blanket on the living-room sofa, where Mrs. Lundquist had lain.

“Listen a minute. I won’t touch you. I just want to say I’m sorry.”

“That’s wonderful. Now will you please leave me alone?”
