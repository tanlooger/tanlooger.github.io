title: Killing senescent cells
---



As we saw in the last chapter, senescent cells slowly accumulate in our tissues as we get older. Their name literally means aged cells, and senescence happens to cells whose telomeres are too short, that have suffered too much damage to their DNA, or are just generally under catastrophic levels of cellular stress. As a result, they slam on the brakes and stop dividing for safety reasons. It’s probably better than the alternative, which could be to turn cancerous, but the senescent state is far from benign：the cell pumps out molecules which fuel chronic inflammation around the body and can turn nearby cells senescent, too, or, ironically, cancerous. If not rapidly removed by the immune system, senescent cells fester, worsening both their local environment and the state of our bodies as a whole.

This shows us that senescent cells satisfy two of the criteria for a hallmark of ageing：they accumulate with age, and their presence accelerates the ageing process. There’s only one further piece of evidence needed to clinch the case against them：does getting rid of them make things better?

The first evidence that it does was published by scientists working at the Mayo Clinic in the US in 2011. It was a proof-of-concept study, which means it was unrealistic in a couple of key ways. Firstly, it used mice bred with a genetic defect which makes them age more rapidly (known as ‘BubR1’ mice), so the lessons learned would not necessarily map onto normal mice. Second, these mice were further genetically modified, and given an extra gene which would cause senescent cells to commit suicide when activated by a particular drug. Since neither normal mice nor human patients have this crucial engineered gene, they wouldn’t have any reaction to the drug. You can neck as much of this elixir of life as you like, and it will have absolutely no effect.

But the results were clear. The first thing to check for was whether the mice had fewer senescent cells after the drug was administered, which they did. Far more excitingly, they also showed an improvement in a number of aspects of the premature ageing normally experienced by this type of mouse. They had bigger muscles, and could run harder for longer on a treadmill; they had more fat under their skin (one of the reasons skin sags in older mice, as in older people, is loss of this so-called ‘subcutaneous’ fat); they developed cataracts later than usual; and, careful biological measurements be damned – they just looked great, with plump, healthy-looking bodies and glossy, thick fur next to their hunchbacked, skin-and-bones counterparts who weren’t given the drug.

The only thing which didn’t improve was overall lifespan. That’s because, even as they impinge on physique, appearance and quality of life, the disabilities caused by senescent cells aren’t the ticking bomb which eventually ends a BubR1 mouse’s life. Instead, this unfortunate breed of mouse dies of heart failure, which isn’t much affected by the presence of senescent cells. Nonetheless, this study was a landmark – the first demonstration that removing senescent cells in an animal relieved the burden of age-related disease and dysfunction.

However, this result wasn’t a slam dunk. Those caveats we mentioned – that this was done in genetically modified, fast-ageing mice – means that this work only really caught the attention of a few senescent-cell geeks. It would be far more convincing in normal mice. A study published in 2015 by the same Mayo Clinic group rose to the challenge, cooking up a clever combination of drugs that goes after the senescent cells directly in regular, unmodified mice.

The scientists’ strategy was to find a drug that nudged the cells towards suicide. It turns out that senescent cells harbour a deep ambivalence about their own continued existence：on the one hand, senescent cells are on their last legs due to damage or stress and really quite want to die, meaning that they activate many of the genes that promote programmed cell death (apoptosis); on the other, they simultaneously activate genes which hold it back, keeping themselves alive. Maintaining the senescent state is a constant battle between the opposing forces of life and death. Perhaps it would be possible to find a drug which would suppress the suicide suppressors and break the deadlock in death’s favour?

The team identified 46 candidate drugs known to interfere with the anti-suicide genes and, after testing them all for senescent-cell-killing potential, identified two winners：a cancer drug used in chemotherapy called dasatinib; and a ‘flavanol’ called quercetin which is found in fruit and vegetables, and sometimes taken as a dietary supplement. When used together they were even more effective, zapping senescent cells in multiple tissues in the body, while leaving innocent bystander cells unharmed. That means the Mayo team’s ‘D+Q’ cocktail was the first ever ‘senolytic’ – a treatment which causes lysis (a biological term for falling to bits) of senescent cells.

The final step was to administer D+Q to aged mice. The results have been impressive：giving old mice D+Q basically makes them biologically younger. The 2015 study administered this cocktail to 24-month-old mice (equivalent to about 70 in human years), and found improved heart function and greater flexibility of blood vessels. An avalanche of subsequent work has looked for D+Q’s effects in many other places：killing senescent cells in mice has been shown to improve atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, osteoporosis, regeneration in old hearts, lung disease and fatty liver disease; it helps old mice run further and faster, strengthens their grip and lets them hang from a wire for longer. This list will undoubtedly be out of date by the time you read it – cellular senescence and senolytics are now incredibly hot topics, with new roles for these zombie cells being uncovered constantly, often by the simple process of removing them and watching how things improve.

Many studies concentrate on individual diseases because it’s quicker to show a short-term change in a specific part of the body than it is to look at healthspan and lifespan overall. But a 2018 study showed that D+Q also has a global effect – a repeat prescription begun at 24 months helped mice live just over six months longer, versus 4.5 months without the drug. Even though treatment was started very late in life, these mice were living the equivalent of five or ten additional years in humans. Critically, this extra lifespan wasn’t lived in a state of geriatric dysfunction; rather, ageing seemed to be deferred. In post-mortems, the group of mice given the drug and those that died younger without it looked very similar – D+Q hadn’t just delayed a single disease and thus extended lifespan, but slowed or partially reversed the ageing process as a whole.

If started earlier in life, senolytics may have even more potential. A 2016 study used the old-school drug-activated genetic modification, but this time put the gene in otherwise normal mice, rather than BubR1 mutants. Starting the suicide-activating drug at 12 months, which is mouse middle age, delayed the onset of cancer and cataracts, improved the function of the heart and kidneys and even made the mice more curious in new environments than control mice not given the drug. It also increased average lifespan by 25 per cent.

Given the range of contexts in which senolytic drugs have been shown to work, as well as the fact that they improve lifespan overall, senescent cells are clearly key players in the ageing process – and getting rid of them will be key to treating it. The next step is to get senolytics working in people. Trials have already started.

The first human clinical trial was published in early 2019, a small safety study using D+Q in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, a disease in which lung tissue becomes badly scarred. IPF is thought to be driven in significant part by senescent cells, and D+Q in mice has been shown to improve it. This was an early pilot experiment, mainly concerned with checking that D+Q is safe to use in people, and involved just 14 participants. The results were positive – the drugs seemed safe, and there was even a modest improvement in physical performance, measured by how far and how fast patients could walk, and get up from a chair. Plenty more work remains to be done before IPF patients will be taking senolytic therapies, but this isn’t a bad start.

While scientists from the Mayo Clinic continue to investigate D+Q, others are pressing ahead with their own senolytic formulations. The furthest along is probably a company called Unity Biotechnology, with two drugs known enigmatically as UBX0101 and UBX1967, targeting the knees of patients with osteoarthritis and the eyes of those suffering from age-related macular degeneration. These might sound like rather random places to start for drugs which delay a significant subset of the ageing process, but there is a logic to them. Firstly, it’s better to begin with diseases where there’s a specific suspicion of senescent cell involvement, where symptoms are clear and the effects could be seen relatively quickly. It’s also better to start by treating people who already have unpleasant diseases; the inevitable side effects are more acceptable if your lungs are already in bad shape from a condition with no known treatment, as opposed to if you’re an otherwise healthy middle-aged person. Finally, the knee and eye are advantageous because they’re small, contained bags of fluid – you can inject a drug there and expect that only a minimal amount will leak into the rest of the body, reducing the likelihood of side effects. (Also, slightly more darkly, eyes are good because you have a backup – the other eye can act both as an experimental control, and an insurance policy in case anything goes terribly wrong.)

The rate of progress in senolytics is dizzying. Going from the first proof-of-concept study in mice in 2011 to the first human trials starting in 2018 is incredibly rapid progress by medical standards. All being well, it’s pretty likely that we’ll see the first senolytics in hospitals in the next few years. Initially they’ll be for specific conditions – IPF, arthritis, and so on – and only patients with symptoms will receive treatment. Gradually, if they prove safe and effective, we should look out for the more exciting prospect：trials of preventative senolytics, given to people with diseases at very early stages, or maybe no diseases at all, gradually encompassing broader and broader swathes of age-related ill health.

As well as pressing on with human trials, there’s plenty more to be done in developing new senolytics. For example, D+Q kills about a third of senescent cells in mice. How much more powerful might its effects be if it killed 50 per cent, or 80 per cent of them? Also, different approaches work more or less well in different tissues：for example, dasatinib is better than another senolytic called navitoclax at killing fat precursor cells, while the drug-activated suicide gene method is better at clearing cells from the heart and kidneys than the liver and intestines. Paradoxically, this could be good news – it shows that we don’t need our first treatments to be perfect to have significant positive effects. Lifespan and health can be improved by a partial, imperfect intervention – with the chance of greater improvements as we get better at clearing these cells more comprehensively, across more tissues in the body.

The key question here is staring us in the face：if senescent cells are so damaging, and getting rid of them so good for mouse and human health, why do they exist at all? Why don’t cells ticking any of the senescence-inducing boxes simply apoptose, vanishing without trace? The answer is that there are some places where senescent cells are more than just bad apples poisoning their local environment.

One example is during development. There are times when we’re developing in the womb that evolution’s solution to construct a particular structure in the body is to selectively kill cells. Sometimes this is done by apoptosis – most famously, our hands and feet grow as strange webbed paws and it is programmed cell death between the developing digits that separates our fingers and toes. In just the last few years, we’ve found that senescence is sometimes used instead. This may be down to the fact that development is a tightly choreographed process, and cells passing chemical messages between one another is key to its success：all those molecules pumped out by the SASP could be important, transient signals for nearby cells before the senescent cells are hoovered up by the immune system.

Once we’re adults, senescent cells continue to play an important role besides cancer prevention：healing wounds. Say you get a cut in your skin：the injury sets an incredibly complex cascade of cellular and molecular action in motion. Nearby cells turn senescent and use their SASPs for good rather than evil：the pro-inflammatory molecules call for help from the immune system to clear up the mess and repel any opportunistic invaders trying to dive through the breach, and other chemicals in the SASP encourage tearing down the damaged structures and the growth of new ones to patch things up as fast as possible. (It’s these pro-growth components of the SASP which can help to turn senescent cells’ neighbours cancerous.)

Given these two examples, ‘senescent’ is actually a poor choice of name for these cells：it implies that they’re old, clapped out, useless, a feature of the end of both cellular and organismal life. It’s entirely fair given how they were discovered, having hit a limit of growth after dividing too many times in a Petri dish. However, the SASP is a pro-growth, pro-healing balm in the right context, harking not from the end of life but its beginning. It might even be that the late-life anti-cancer function of senescent cells is an afterthought, a case of evolution co-opting a cellular state whose original purpose was developmental to reduce the risk of cancer as we age.

There’s a risk that removing senescent cells in some tissues could have unintended side effects. Some cell populations may be so small that senescent hangers-on are sub-optimal but nonetheless essential to maintaining function. One worry might be neurons：if a neuron is senescent but nonetheless an integral part of a memory, or a brain function you’d rather not compromise, it might be better to rescue it rather than finish it off.

There are a couple of other approaches to dealing with senescent cells which we could turn to in tissues where they’re non-ideal but necessary. Firstly, we could look for drugs which leave a cell in the senescent state, but suppress the SASP, thus reducing the harm it does, which have been dubbed ‘senomorphics’. Secondly, we could try to coax senescent cells back into the fold and turn them into normal cells again. This could be achieved by epigenetic reprogramming, which we’ll discuss in a lot more detail in Chapter 8.

Eventually, the ideal outcome would be a visit to a gleaming clinic every six months or few years for a check-up, no more unusual than a trip to the dentist or optician. You’d have a few quick tests to establish the senescent cell burden in different parts of your body, and optimise your dosage of different drugs to target them in each organ; be prescribed a few pills, or given a few injections; then maybe stay in for a few hours to check that everything went okay, before heading home with instructions to take it easy, and a tube of lotion to speed the healing process in case you cut yourself in the next few days. We know from the fact that human lifespans in the rich world are pushing 80 years that senescent cells take decades to accumulate to really damaging levels, so infrequent treatment does seem plausible. In mice, the positive effects of senolytics lasted for months after a single dose – it’s thus possible that humans may be able to go that long, or maybe longer between treatments.

For now at least, it seems hard to overstate the significance of the success of senolytics. Senescent cells are a fundamental driver of ageing, present in many tissues in the body and implicated in a growing number of diverse diseases. The results in mice show that removing them can improve both how long and how well they live, with no obvious side effects. If we can get senolytics working in people, it will open up a cornucopia of new therapeutic options for diseases. It will also provide us with an irrefutable demonstration of the principle behind biogerontology：intervening in the ageing process can pay dividends for life and health. No doctor would ever put ‘overburdened by senescent cells’ on a death certificate. They are in a fundamentally different category to the diseases we fixate upon in modern medicine – a cause rather than a consequence, related to many, maybe even most of the diseases we worry about in old age. Quite apart from the drugs themselves, the idea of preventative senolytics – a universal, protective treatment for everyone, even the healthy – lays the conceptual groundwork for a medical revolution.

All of this means that a senolytic could well be the first true anti-ageing potion to pass your lips.
