title: Amyloid
---




We’ve seen that one nasty property of some proteins is that they aggregate into amyloids. These are proteins which, misfolded in particular unfortunate ways, gain the ability to stick together into clumps. Where the normal version of a protein will happily potter around doing its thing and minding its own business, an amyloid-prone misfolded version will seek out others like itself and latch on, in a kind of protein clone conga. Individual strings of amyloid are known as fibrils and they can aggregate into larger structures called plaques.

Plaques are most commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease – they were first observed by Alois Alzheimer, who found strange plaques between the cells and ‘tangles’ inside them in the brain of a patient who had died at 55 with the dementia which now bears the doctor’s name. It was 80 years before we had the biochemical and genetic tools to work out what these strange substances were, and to formulate a coherent theory for what caused the disease.

The first solid clue came from cases of ‘early-onset’ Alzheimer’s：patients who tragically come down with dementia as early as their twenties – though more commonly in their forties and fifties, rather like Alzheimer’s first patient. Dementia is normally very starkly a disease of ageing：it’s almost unheard of before the age of 60, but then its occurrence rises even faster than risk of death, with the chance of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis doubling every five rather than eight years. These early-onset cases are therefore remarkable：why do these patients get dementia decades before everyone else?

Years of genetic detective work eventually narrowed the problem down to mutations in a single gene：APP, the gene that codes for amyloid precursor protein, or APP. APP is normally chopped into three fragments, each of which has different jobs in the brain. About 10 per cent of the time one of these chops will result in a fragment of ‘amyloid beta’ being produced. This is happening all the time, in all of us, but with age something changes which either increases the production or reduces the clearance of amyloid beta (or both), and enough of it lingers that it sticks together to form plaques.

The mutated forms of APP which drive early-onset dementia are more likely to produce amyloid beta, so people carrying them build up plaques far more rapidly than people with the normal version of the gene. The appearance of amyloid plaques correlates with the onset of the disease and provides evidence that too much amyloid is enough to cause Alzheimer’s.

However, decades of further investigation and failed therapies have served to undermine this ‘amyloid hypothesis’. People without dementia often have extensive amyloid plaques, and those with the disease can be surprisingly amyloid-free. Parts of the brain with the most amyloid often fail to correspond with the parts of the brain thought to be worst affected based on patients’ cognitive symptoms. The biggest challenge to the amyloid hypothesis is the graveyard of unsuccessful drug candidates – every one of dozens of attempts so far to interfere with the creation of amyloid or clear it up after it’s produced has failed to have any effect on the symptoms of dementia sufferers. This isn’t because we can’t clear the amyloid：the latest immunotherapies have shown significant success by using antibodies, molecules which stick to the plaques and encourage the immune system to clear them up, to rid the brain of amyloid. Brain scans of patients who have had these treatments seem to be almost completely clear of the misfolded protein … they just don’t see any actual functional improvement, rendering this impressive technical achievement somewhat moot.

The amyloid hypothesis staggers on anyway. What might be the final theory in its defence argues that we have simply intervened too late in previous clinical trials：we need to catch the amyloid before it destroys neurons and sets the other dominoes, perhaps some yet unknown, toppling. Thus, new trials are addressing this timing question in patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s. Genetic testing for mutations of APP (and a few other genes) allows patients to be identified many years before an almost certain prognosis, meaning that they can be started on immunotherapy well before the disease begins. In the next few years, we should get the first results of these trials.

There are other possible culprits in Alzheimer’s. Those tangles which Alois Alzheimer found inside brain cells are aggregates of another protein called tau, and therapies to slow its production or remove it are in the works. Dementia also seems to correlate with diabetes, leading scientists to wonder whether the way the brain deals with sugar and insulin could be a key component of the disease. Some theories suggest that Alzheimer’s is driven by infections, with suspicion aroused by finding herpesviruses and bacteria responsible for gum disease entombed in the plaques in sufferers’ brains. Others suggest that dementia is driven by inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory immune-calming strategies might help – which, given the prominence of inflammation in ageing, is highly plausible. Scientists are also investigating whether the systems which allow waste products to drain from the brain may be impaired as we get older. Sleep seems to be important, with the brain using its downtime to flush out waste products, including amyloid; sleep duration and quality are known to decline with age, so this could be another factor. It’s quite likely that several of these theories will prove to be partly responsible and uncovering their interplay may be crucial for a total cure.

However, all of these alternative theories still need to explain early-onset Alzheimer’s, in which beta amyloid aggregation alone seems to set off cognitive decline. We know that beta amyloid aggregation is something which happens in many of us – even in people without symptoms of dementia, 20 per cent have detectable beta amyloid by the age of 65, and almost half have some by 90. Maybe, given long enough, beta amyloid would get us all. Thus, it might be a reasonable precaution to clear aggregating amyloids out of everyone’s brain. At a minimum, it’s good to have these reliable anti-amyloid treatments if only because we know that young and healthy brains don’t have these deposits, while old and diseased ones do. Perhaps amyloid-clearing drugs will be needed together with tau-busting, anti-inflammatory or entirely left-field future Alzheimer’s treatments.

Though Alzheimer’s is the most famous place where amyloids play a role, we are continuing to learn how similar aggregates of different proteins play a part in many other diseases. We’ve already met alpha-synuclein, which forms amyloids in Parkinson’s; other neurodegenerative diseases like ALS (which causes death of ‘motor neurons’ that control muscles) and Huntington’s have aggregates of their own, formed from different misfolded proteins. Type 2 diabetes is accompanied by amyloids made from a protein named (confusingly) amylin. Though many amyloid diseases are caused or substantially worsened by genetic mutations which cause the proteins to clump together, some aggregation happens to all of us as a part of normal ageing.

One amyloid which gets far less attention than amyloid beta is formed from transthyretin, or TTR. TTR is a blood-borne protein which ferries thyroid hormones and vitamin A around the body. It’s evidently a protein right on the cusp of amyloid formation, because there are over one hundred known mutations which cause it to form amyloid：any one of many tiny changes can push it over the edge into rapid aggregation. TTR amyloid can build up all over the body in older people, earning the condition the name senile systemic amyloidosis, or SSA. It’s often worst in the blood vessels, where amyloid’s effects on the cells lining vessels can narrow and stiffen them, and the heart, where it strangles the muscle and disrupts the electrical signals which cause it to beat. Ultimately, this leads to heart failure, a diagnosis meaning that the heart can no longer pump enough blood to adequately supply the whole body. This is a common condition in elderly people, with a variety of different causes, and it’s thought that TTR amyloid may be an underappreciated one.

The problem is that cardiac amyloidosis is hard to diagnose. No one wants to take a heart biopsy, let alone of an old patient with heart problems, and the non-invasive tests for it are somewhat specialist (they include MRI and PET scans, which are not a normal diagnostic test when an older person turns up in hospital with heart problems). The other issue is cultural：autopsies are very rarely performed when an old person dies. If an 82-year-old finally succumbs to heart failure, probably alongside a few other medical conditions, no one is likely to call in a pathologist to carefully dissect the body and determine exactly what killed them. This is another symptom of our medical and scientific practice being biased against ageing：‘dying of old age’ is considered unremarkable, and rarely merits detailed investigation. It’s not that we need the precise cause of death to be determined for every older person who dies, but it would be useful to have some more data about what pathologies are present in order to work out what biogerontologists should be trying to fix most urgently, and what problems might be nascent in elderly people, waiting to strike us down if we just lived a bit longer.

Amyloidosis is definitely a candidate killer-in-waiting. A study in Finland found that, on autopsy, 25 per cent of over-85s had TTR amyloid on their hearts – rising to more than half of those who died aged over 100. Another in a Spanish hospital found that 13 per cent of patients with one type of heart failure had significant amyloid deposits, something which would almost certainly have gone undiagnosed were it not for their research. Those at most risk are probably the very oldest old, who have had the good fortune to dodge all the other age-related diseases – it may well be the slow accumulation of TTR amyloid that kills them. SSA is hypothesised to be the leading cause of death in supercentenarians, people who live more than 110 years.

Like the amyloid beta responsible for Alzheimer’s, TTR and other amyloids are in researchers’ crosshairs. There are immune therapies, like the antibodies which have been successfully used to clear amyloid-beta from the brains of Alzheimer’s sufferers, in development for TTR amyloid as well – one example is a drug candidate named PRX004, under development by a company called Prothena.

Also under investigation are ‘catabodies’, a type of antibody which, instead of labelling something as a target for the immune system, destroys it directly. We actually produce catabodies naturally – against amyloid beta, tau and TTR at least, and maybe against more misfolded proteins. However, our natural defences are insufficient and, after identifying some appropriate catabodies to optimise, this idea is being taken forward as a treatment called Cardizyme by another company, Covalent Biosciences. They are also developing Alzyme and Tauzyme to target the amyloid beta and tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s. All three have been shown to clear their respective amyloids in mice. Catabodies have two key advantages over antibodies：firstly, because they don’t just cling on to a target until the immune system destroys it but smash it themselves and move on, the same catabody can work over and over again on many molecules in an aggregate; and secondly, because they don’t call the immune system’s attention to the problem, they create far less inflammation, which, as you know by now, is best avoided where possible.

There’s also a potentially exciting approach which uses a chemical commonality which is shared by a number of different kinds of amyloid to break them all down with a single therapy, with a rather incredible backstory. Known as ‘general amyloid interaction motif’, or GAIM, it was discovered entirely by chance in a bacteriophage (or phage for short), a type of virus which doesn’t infect humans, but bacteria. The virus is known as M13 and was first discovered in the sewers of Munich in 1963. It went on to become a staple of lab biology and, in the early 2000s, Israeli scientist Beka Solomon used M13 phages in an attempt to ferry more of an anti-amyloid antibody she was developing into the brains of mice with Alzheimer’s disease. To her surprise, the control group of mice which only received the virus and none of the antibody showed significant cognitive improvement, a finding which made no sense, because M13 infects E. coli bacteria, and shouldn’t have any effect on human cells or proteins.

It turned out that, by an incredible coincidence, the molecular lock and key which M13 uses to gain access to E. coli cells is remarkably similar to a molecular structure found in many kinds of human protein aggregates. As well as granting access to bacterial cells, the viral protein could break apart aggregates of amyloid beta and tau in Alzheimer’s, the alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s, the huntingtin behind Huntington’s disease, and even the aggregates behind motor neurone disease and CJD (a rare human brain condition made famous by the ‘mad cow disease’ crisis in the 1990s). It’s hard to overemphasise how bizarre this is, but nonetheless GAIM has been shown to clear both amyloid beta and tau in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, and to improve their cognitive function. Human trials are ongoing, headed up by a company called Proclara Biosciences.

Ideally, one or more of these treatments will be turned into preventative therapies for amyloid-based diseases. Perhaps we could all get injections of anti-plaque drugs at regular intervals to prevent the build-up of these toxic aggregates or, even better, be immunised against many different amyloids in childhood along with measles and diphtheria. Intervening before we’re old and diseases are too far advanced is exactly what the treatment of ageing should be about, and all of these therapies have the potential to be used preventatively. However we go about it, clearing amyloids is likely to be important to treating ageing.

In this chapter, we’ve explored how to remove senescent cells and problem proteins. In the next, we’ll look at places where simply getting rid of things is not a sufficient treatment, and we’re going to need to replace and rebuild them in our ageing bodies.





*This is a formalised version of the serendipitous experiment which gave rise to the discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, where blue-green fungus set up shop on a Petri dish which had accidentally been left open was found to have developed a halo around it in which bacteria wouldn’t grow. The halo was caused by a chemical secreted by the mould which was toxic to bacteria – eventually isolated and named penicillin after the Penicillium fungus in which it was discovered.

*A ‘mouse model’ is what scientists call mice genetically modified to be at risk of a human disease, either because waiting around for them to get it would take a long time or, in the case of some conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, because mice don’t suffer from them at all. This means that there are caveats when trying to translate findings from mice to humans – but it’s often a vital first step in understanding how new treatments work. Nonetheless, bear in mind both in this book and elsewhere that a mouse model is one step further removed from the clinic than an experiment in normal mice might be.
