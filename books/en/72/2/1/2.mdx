title: Reinventing recycling：upgrading autophagy
---




We’ve seen that a reduction in autophagy – the ‘self-eating’ process of cellular recycling which clears up broken proteins, damaged mitochondria and more – is likely to be central to the ageing process. Autophagy is our body’s own way of getting rid of junk, so could we take advantage of this natural system to keep our cells pristine?

Given that dietary restriction (DR) increases levels of autophagy, eating substantially less could be one approach to activating the process and slowing our own ageing. However, it would be even better if we could find some way to mimic the biological effects of restricting diet, but with less of the tedious abstinence. Enter ‘DR mimetics’：drugs which activate many of the same mechanisms as DR itself (including autophagy) without the need to eat less.

The story of DR mimetics begins over half a century ago, in November 1964, as the Canadian naval vessel Cape Scott left port in Canada bound for Easter Island. Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, deep in the Pacific Ocean, some 3,500 kilometres from the coast of Chile. Known as Rapa Nui in the native Polynesian, it’s most famous for its monolithic moai：gigantic human-like stone statues with enormous heads. Prompted by plans from the Chilean government to build an international airport, intruding on centuries of almost complete isolation, the Cape Scott carried a 38-strong expedition team whose job it was to scientifically document the pristine island environment and its 949 native inhabitants before it was lost forever.

The expedition was eventful to the point of nearly failing entirely. At the time, Rapa Nui was a Chilean colony, and the arrival of the Cape Scott coincided with a chaotic but bloodless revolution：the islanders took Rapa Nui’s only bulldozer hostage, Chile sent 40 marines to investigate the unrest and, at one point, the rebel leader Alfonso Rapu was forced to take refuge in the scientists’ compound and escaped disguised in women’s clothing. (Shortly afterwards, the revolution succeeded, and he was elected mayor of the island.)

However, amid the chaos, meticulous scientific sampling of Rapa Nui and its inhabitants was taking place. Of 17,000 samples, medical records and X-rays collected, the most significant would turn out to be an unassuming vial of soil. The sample was returned to Canada and, four years later, given to a research group interested in finding new medicines in chemicals produced by bacteria.

The work was painstaking：bacteria were isolated from the soil, grown on plates of nutritious agar gel, then cultured with a range of test microorganisms such as other bacteria and fungi to check for antibiotic effects.* One strain, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, was lethally effective when placed next to Candida, the yeast which causes thrush infections. The scientists isolated the chemical responsible for killing the fungus and dubbed it rapamycin, after Rapa Nui.

Rapamycin turned out to be much more than an anti-fungal agent. Further investigation showed that it was a powerful immune suppressant, and also stopped cells from multiplying. Though its effects on the immune system ended its short career as a potential fungal antibiotic, these two findings were far bigger：immune suppression is vital to stop patients rejecting transplanted organs and its power to stop cell proliferation was immediately recognised as a potential new cancer treatment. After years of promising investigations, however, rapamycin still hadn’t been formulated into a workable drug – and, out of the blue, pharma company Ayerst, which had been leading development, shuttered the programme in 1982 as part of a restructuring exercise.

Scientist Suren Sehgal was dumbfounded. Convinced that this drug could be revolutionary, he sneaked a few vials of the rapamycin-producing bacteria home and hid them in his freezer, helpfully labelled ‘DON’T EAT!’ There they stayed for five years, surviving a house move (with the freezer duct-taped shut and packed with dry ice), until he managed to convince his bosses to let him defrost the bugs and begin research on rapamycin once more.

You’ve probably realised by now that rapamycin isn’t just an immune suppressant and anti-cancer drug (though Sehgal was right, and it is now licensed for use as both) – its biggest contribution to human health could be as anti-ageing medicine. And, if you one day take rapamycin or one of its derivatives to stave off old age, you have that ludicrous chain of events to thank. The Chilean government’s decision to build an airport on Easter Island in the 1960s has already saved millions of lives – and, if it works against ageing, it could rack up billions more.

Scientists trying to work out how rapamycin actually works discovered that it interacts with a protein which was named after the drug：‘target of rapamycin’, or TOR. TOR is a nexus in cellular metabolism, critical to some of the most fundamental processes in life. The subtle variant of TOR found in humans and mice is known as mTOR, and both it and TOR work in basically the same way：they sense levels of sugars, amino acids, oxygen and insulin, and give instructions to other proteins in the cell based on what they find.

Rapamycin jams up one form of mTOR called mTORC1 such that it can’t signal to the rest of the cell when food is plentiful. This effectively short-circuits nutrient detection, tricking the cell into thinking food is short, even if it isn’t. At high doses, this can entirely stop cellular growth; at lower doses, rapamycin can dial down TOR, reducing growth and promoting autophagy.

As a result, rapamycin works an awful lot like DR and, like eating less, it extends lifespan in yeast, worms and flies. Based on both the common mechanism and this evidence in simple model organisms, scientists set out in 2006 to do a rigorous test of rapamycin, along with several other anti-ageing interventions, in mice.

However, nothing involving rapamycin is ever simple. They intended to start treating the mice aged four months, but it took over a year to develop a method of coating the rapamycin so that it could survive both the food preparation process and the journey through the mouse stomach. By this time the mice were 20 months old – roughly equivalent to 60 in human years. It seemed likely that any effect would be dramatically reduced by starting this late：was there even any point in doing the experiment at all?

Their fears were misplaced, and the results of the study came as a surprise to everyone. They demonstrated something truly remarkable：rapamycin works, even when administered to mice which are already old. The mice had lifespans on average 10 per cent longer than their untreated peers. This was a real breakthrough：not only the first ever demonstration that a drug could extend lifespan in mammals but, quite accidentally and even more impressively, a demonstration that it works even when started late in life. Subsequent studies have confirmed what will by now be a familiar refrain：that these longer-lived mice weren’t struggling on in frailty, but staying younger for longer, with fewer and less severe age-related diseases. Rapamycin slows cell death and improves cognitive performance in the brains of mouse models* of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and improves the functioning of arteries in diabetic mice, probably by stimulating autophagy.

This is an impressive proof of principle for DR mimetics – after a tortuous tale taking us from a Pacific island via a home freezer to some unintentionally elderly mice, we have a result which sounds like it’s crying out for human translation：even if started very late in life, rapamycin can extend lifespan and healthspan. Unfortunately, the problem with rapamycin is the side effects. Rapamycin is a laser-guided drug, targeting mTOR with precision – but mTOR is a target with immense tactical significance, a command centre of the cell, and knocking it out has dramatic repercussions.

Firstly, given that rapamycin’s first use in patients was as an immunosuppressant, it will come as no surprise that it can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infections – and there’s no point ageing more slowly if you just die of the flu instead. It also predisposes users to diabetes, making it a double-edged sword – postponing the likes of cancer and heart disease while bringing forward another of the harbingers of age-related ill health. Then there’s the weirder stuff：hair loss, mouth ulcers, slowed wound healing, joint pain and, in male users, fertility problems (one study in mice noted that rapamycin reduced their testes in size by 80 per cent!). While it’s still a useful drug for transplant patients and cancer sufferers, people with no pre-existing conditions are far less likely to want to run that gauntlet for the chance of a modest reduction in the rate of ageing.

However, treatments for our anti-ageing arsenal may yet result from that expedition to Easter Island. Firstly, those side effects are observed at far higher doses of rapamycin than are needed for its use as an anti-ageing medication. In fact, some of them are even entirely reversed when it’s given at lower doses – counter-intuitively, while a high dose of rapamycin will suppress the immune system, a low dose doesn’t suppress it a bit as you might expect, but seems to enhance its performance.

Furthermore, when pharmacologists get hold of a new drug, they often try tweaking it to alter its properties, and rapamycin is no exception：it is the parent of a family of derivatives known as rapalogues. Experiments in mice with different rapalogues taken at different intervals and doses show that it is possible to maintain the benefits while reducing side effects.

Work on rapamycin and DR more generally has also inspired the search for other DR mimetics, some of which are undergoing clinical trials. One is metformin, a drug which has been in use since the 1950s as a treatment for diabetes. A trial of metformin in healthy older volunteers will begin shortly in the US – and it’s the first ever drug trial testing a drug’s effects against the whole ageing process rather than a particular disease. (We’ll examine the scientific and wider implications of this groundbreaking trial in Chapter 11.) Though these efforts have been delayed by coronavirus, the scientists involved are trying to start a small-scale study to see if metformin could improve immunity in elderly people and thus strengthen their response against COVID-19.

There’s also spermidine, which was first discovered (as you might guess from the name) in semen.* Spermidine activates autophagy, and has been shown to improve heart health and extend lifespan by 10 per cent in mice, even if started late in life; suggestively, a study looking at the connection between diet and lifespan in humans found that those getting the most spermidine in their diet lived five years longer than those getting the least, even after correcting for other differences in their diets, lifestyle and general health. (Particularly high concentrations of spermidine are present in mushrooms, soybeans and cheddar cheese.) While observational studies should always be taken with a pinch of salt, together with the lifespan extension in mice this is exciting enough to inspire some proper trials, so watch this space.

Other naturally sourced contenders include resveratrol, a compound found in the skin of grapes; curcumin, one of the chemicals which makes turmeric yellow; aspirin, which on top of its many other physiological effects was recently found to enhance autophagy; and quercetin, which we met very recently as half of the D+Q duo. None of these quite has the firm evidence base to suggest that healthy people should take them preventatively, but there’s plenty of biochemical diversity there for researchers to explore. As well as scouring the natural world, drug companies will also be searching for artificial compounds which either build on the capabilities of known molecules or come up with entirely novel ones. A company called resTORbio is trialling a new mTORC1 inhibitor called RTB101, which has shown promise in improving older people’s response to a flu vaccine and reducing subsequent respiratory infections. The company is also trialling the drug for other age-related diseases, including Parkinson’s and, at the time of writing, a new study of RTB101 has just been announced to test whether it can reduce the severity of COVID-19 in nursing home residents.

Given that there are several at various stages from development to trials, and that many of these are natural compounds or existing drugs repurposed, DR mimetics are racing senolytics to be the first actual anti-ageing treatment deployed in clinical care. (If metformin or RTB101 prove effective against coronavirus, they may win!) In common with senolytics, these drugs will probably first be used to treat a particular condition, whether that be COVID-19, or diseases where loss of autophagy is particularly relevant – neurodegenerative conditions seem a likely contender. If that works, patients taking the drugs will be under keen surveillance to see if there are any other, wider benefits to taking them. Ultimately, these medicines may become general-purpose preventative pills for multiple ills of old age.

DR mimetics all share the same broad strategy：tinker with known biochemical mechanisms to unlock the benefits of dietary restriction. The advantage is that DR is the most robust, long-standing anti-ageing intervention we have; the downside is that we aren’t expecting DR to have world-changing benefits in humans, so we wouldn’t expect drugs which mimic it to have seismic effects either (though I’d definitely take a few years’ extra healthspan if offered). The next step is to try to tinker with autophagy directly, rather than restricting diets or dealing with molecular middle managers in the cell. There are plans to engineer our own cellular recycling machinery which go beyond what our bodies can do on their own.

One problem which causes autophagy to falter with age is that, over time, the system can literally get clogged up with gunk. Autophagy takes place in compartments in the cell called lysosomes, which are like tiny, itinerant stomachs, floating around ready to digest the waste which is ferried to them by various different cellular refuse collectors. Like the stomach, the lysosome’s interior is acidic and full of digestive enzymes, each specialised in chopping or smashing or ripping apart particular types of molecular waste product.

Unfortunately, there are some kinds of waste so mangled that none of the sixty or so enzymes in the lysosome can work out how to crowbar it open. This isn’t such a problem at first – if you’ve got some undegradable troublemaker floating around in the cell, you could do worse than incarcerate it within the lysosome, away from all the important, delicate cellular components. However, there comes a point where the lysosome is so bloated with rubbish that it’s no longer able to work at maximum efficiency.

The rubbish is known as ‘lipofuscin’ and it’s made up of broken and misfolded proteins and fats, crosslinked together along with highly reactive metals like iron and copper. It’s easy to spot under a microscope because it’s fluorescent – if you shine light of a particular colour on it, it glows back at you in a different colour. Lipofuscin is a particular problem in non-dividing cells, like those in the brain and the heart – this is one reason neurodegenerative conditions may be the first targets of autophagy-enhancing drugs. Cells which are constantly replicating can sidestep the build-up by dividing waste between each daughter, and a problem shared is a problem halved – perhaps even a problem solved if there is some threshold level above which lipofuscin starts to become an issue, and continual halving can keep levels below that threshold. This could happen if, for example, too much lipofuscin dilutes the acid inside the lysosome to a point where some of its enzymes, which require an acidic environment to do their job, stop working. This in turn would cause further garbage to accumulate – garbage the cell was previously able to break down – and set a vicious cycle in motion. This idea is known, delightfully, as the garbage catastrophe theory of ageing.

One place where this vicious cycle is particularly problematic is the eye, in a condition known as age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD is the most common form of blindness in rich countries,* and the majority of people over the age of 80 have at least some signs of it. The disease is caused when ‘retinal pigment epithelial’ (RPE) cells die. These cells support the light-sensitive rods and cones on the back of the eye, and their death causes loss of vision in the macula – the central region of the eye responsible for high-resolution colour vision.

One of the prime suspects for this cell death is lipofuscin：in old age, distended lysosomes stuffed so full of a vision-related waste product called A2E can take up fully 20 per cent of the volume inside the cell. And it’s not just our eyes where lipofuscin seems to be behind age-related problems：another example of lysosomes stuffed to bursting is found in the foam cells which make up atherosclerotic plaques, which are made up of immune cells with lysosomes clogged up with cholesterol, particularly in oxidised and glycated forms which are hard to digest.

These lysosomal vicious cycles might be worth trying to break. One suggestion is inspired by how we currently treat ‘lysosomal storage disorders’ (or LSDs), a collection of rare conditions resulting from mutations in the genes coding for the various enzymes the lysosome contains. If one of those sixty junk-zapping enzymes is broken or missing, sufferers are left unable to break down the particular waste product which that enzyme degrades, causing their lysosomes to fill up with it at an unfortunately rapid rate. Not coincidentally, there are about sixty LSDs, with the worst types causing death in infancy. However, some of them can be effectively cured by providing patients with the enzyme they’re missing, allowing many patients (depending on the LSD) to lead relatively normal lives.

In ageing, rather than providing a replacement for an enzyme which is missing from the body, we’d need to provide new enzymes which can help lysosomes deal with garbage they can’t currently tackle. One source could be bacteria. Bacteria are incredibly versatile organisms and have worked their way into almost every conceivable ecosystem on the planet, finding ways to subsist on incredibly unlikely foodstuffs. Thus, it seems pretty likely that, for any given type of lipofuscin, there’s a bacterium somewhere which can make a living digesting it. Several different groups of scientists are taking this route, trying to narrow the search for enzymes which could break down products which our cells alone cannot.

Multiple different species of bacteria have been identified which can degrade the cholesterol-based waste products which are a problem in atherosclerosis, from habitats as diverse as North Sea sediment and piles of manure. One particularly fascinating study discovered some candidate cholesterol-crunching enzymes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis infections in humans. Tuberculosis is an infection with incredible skills when it comes to evading the human immune system：its bacteria are capable of being engulfed by and then hiding inside the macrophages sent to dispatch them. How they survived inside these immune cells was a long-standing mystery, until it was discovered that they were able to subsist by extracting energy from none other than cholesterol inside the cell. When the genes responsible were transferred into human cells in a dish, the cells gained the ability to break down cholesterol. Unfortunately, further work is needed here because the products the cholesterol was broken down into turned out to be toxic. But it would be a neat symmetry if tuberculosis – probably one of the leading killers in human history – helps us create tools to defeat cardiovascular disease, one of humanity’s deadliest foes today.

Similar work on A2E, the lipofuscin associated with age-related sight loss, has identified enzymes which can break it down, too. The furthest advanced in development is called manganese peroxidase, usually found in fungi which live on dead wood, which use the enzyme to break down lignins – tough materials which give strength to wood and bark. A 2018 paper by a startup called Ichor Therapeutics got as far as injecting a modified version of it into the eyes of mice, and demonstrated that it rapidly cleared out both A2E, and a number of other by-products of visual chemistry which accumulate in lysosomes of RPE cells. They are hoping to turn this preliminary work into a treatment called Lysoclear.

Once suitable enzymes have been isolated and optimised for both efficiency and safety in humans, we should be able to inject them just as we do to treat LSDs, or use gene therapy (more on which in Chapter 8) to allow our cells to manufacture these enzymes themselves.

A final approach is to convince cells to take out the trash, rather than hoarding it in their lysosomes. This could be advantageous if lipofuscin is made up of too many diverse products for a small number of additional enzymes to digest. Once outside the cell, the best-case scenario is that macrophages swing by and pick up the debris, before getting rid of it entirely. There’s already a drug called Remofuscin which seems to do exactly this for A2E in the retinal cells of both mice and monkeys, and is currently undergoing trials for Stargardt disease, a genetic condition in which macular degeneration is accelerated to the point where it affects children rather than the elderly. If it works, its use could be extended to the age-related version of the disease, and it or similar drugs could convince other lipofuscin-stuffed cells to get rid of their toxic stockpiles.

All in all, there are quite a few options available to us to improve our bodies’ built-in recycling capabilities, either by convincing our cells to do more of it or augmenting its capabilities to get rid of otherwise unrecyclable waste. Drugs that mimic the effect of dietary restriction and treatments to help our cells deal with accumulating garbage are in development, and may save our sight, our minds and more from deterioration with age.
