title: 6 In with the new

There are some aspects of our ageing biology where getting rid of the bad actors won’t be a sufficient therapy unless we can replace them with something better. For example, though the aged immune system can be dysfunctional and put us at greater risk of infectious diseases and cancer, it’s better than the alternative：the only thing worse than having an ageing immune system is having no immune system at all.

Thus, we need to come up with ways to reinforce our ailing defences, and far more besides, providing our biology with a helping hand to reverse some of the decline of ageing. This chapter focuses on four broad categories of replacement therapy：first, stem cell therapies, where providing stem cells can underpin the regeneration of many different parts of our body; then, the immune system, where various ideas (including some stem cell therapies) could help restore it to a more youthful state; next, the good guys in our microbiome – the huge ecosystem of bacteria, viruses and fungi which we carry in our guts, on our skin and elsewhere – which may also need topping up with age; and finally, the long-lived scaffold of proteins outside our cells which suffer chemical damage over time, where replacement may be a more promising approach than repair.
