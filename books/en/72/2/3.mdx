title: 7 Running repairs
---



Sometimes the best approach to fixing a hallmark of ageing is neither removal nor replacement, but repair. Our DNA is a case in point：our cells wouldn’t last long without their molecular instructions, and replacing the two metres of the stuff in tens of trillions of cells would be somewhere between impractical and impossible. That means, from trimmed telomeres to mutations, we’re going to have to find ways to fix DNA while it’s still in our cells.

We’ll also take a look at rebalancing the signals in our blood to restore them to more youthful levels and patching up damaged mitochondria such that they can keep generating energy for our cells into old age. We’ll start with telomeres.
