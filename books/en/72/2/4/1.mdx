title: Upgrading our genes
---



Our DNA is the blueprint for our bodies, from their large-scale layout to the tiniest components which govern interactions within and between cells. As we discover more about the human genome, there seem to be ever more stories in the press about a ‘gene for’ this or that, and it can be tempting to lapse into ‘genetic determinism’ – believing that your entire biological future, risk of disease, lifespan and even much of your personality, is fixed by the contents of your genetic code.

Life is, of course, more complicated than that. It’s obvious that DNA does affect lifespan：after all, humans can live for more than 100 years, but a nematode worm can only live for a few weeks, and that difference is encoded in our DNA. We’ve also seen that mutations in single genes can dramatically change the lifespan of worms and mice in the lab. Can we put this knowledge to practical use to extend the healthy lifespan of people?

The first question is to what extent our genes determine our longevity normally. Clever studies with identical and non-identical twins and analyses of large cohorts allow us to estimate the degree of ‘heritability’ of longevity – the extent to which long or short life can be inherited. The size of this effect turns out to be surprisingly small – somewhere around 25 per cent. However, more recent work has revised down even this low estimate. Unfortunately for statisticians, people don’t usually pick their partner entirely at random – they tend to pair up with people whose characteristics are more similar to themselves than would be expected by chance, a tendency known as ‘assortative mating’. A 2018 study, using thousands of birth and death records from a genealogy website, mathematically corrected for this effect – and found that the heritability of longevity dropped to under 10 per cent. The researchers actually found that married couples’ lifespans were more closely correlated than the lifespans of opposite-gendered children.

This is empowering news for many of us：your lifespan isn’t written in your DNA, and you needn’t see your parents’ longevity as a ceiling on how long you can hope to live. With the right diet, exercise, lifestyle and a bit of luck, our destiny is in our own hands to a larger extent than simplistic genetic determinism would have us believe.

However, it’s disempowering news for any biologists hoping to comb through the population looking for the genetic underpinnings of longevity：genetic effects are subtle and we shouldn’t expect to uncover amazing longevity mutations if we go out naïvely looking in the general population without carefully correcting for issues like assortative mating. Fortunately, the task can be made a lot easier if we look in more unusual places. The first place to try is the exceptionally old.

There’s something distinctly strange (in a good way) about people who make it to 100. Studies find that they weigh about the same and don’t smoke or drink much less, exercise much more or eat much better than the general population. In spite of this, they not only live longer, but they seem to put off getting age-related diseases until later, too. A study of US centenarians found that they spent dramatically less of their lives with disease：9 per cent for centenarians versus 18 per cent in the wider population. They also retain their independence for longer, with the average centenarian in the study still able to perform everyday tasks until their 100th birthday.

As we move from the merely normally old to the exceptionally old, the heritability of longevity seems to increase. Whether your mum or dad lived to 70 or 80 doesn’t mean a great deal in terms of your own likely lifespan, but if one of your parents made it to 100, or even beyond, it might be time to sit up and pay attention. You may have noticed this yourself – perhaps a friend’s family or, if you’re very lucky, your own, can trace in its family tree a dynasty of long-lived women (statistically, they usually are women：female centenarians outnumber males by over five to one). This is one anecdotal observation which does stand up to statistical scrutiny：if one of your siblings lives to 100, you stand about a ten times greater chance than someone in the general population of doing the same.

As a result, geneticists have gone fishing for versions of genes which are overrepresented in people who have made it to 100. This has proved to be a surprisingly tough gig, but two genes do come up pretty consistently：APOE and FOXO3.

The APOE gene codes for a protein called Apo-E which is responsible for transporting cholesterol around your body, and which version you have has a huge effect on your odds of both cardiovascular problems and dementia. It comes in three variants – APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4. The most common variant is E3 – about two-thirds of people globally have the plain vanilla E3/E3 genotype (i.e. one copy of E3 from your mum, and one from your dad), and that gives them a 20 per cent chance of developing dementia during their life. The E4 variant is less common, but it’s bad news：having one copy, present in about 25 per cent of people, increases the risk of Alzheimer’s to almost 50:50. People with two copies (thankfully just 2 per cent of the population) are almost certain to develop Alzheimer’s, and are diagnosed at an average age of 68 – about a decade earlier than those with E3/E3 genes. E2, on the other hand, seems to be protective, roughly halving the lifetime risk of dementia if you have a copy from one parent – and maybe reducing risk by a further factor of four if you have two copies. It’s a similar story with heart disease, with E4 carriers again at higher risk.

No surprise then that your APOE genes can have a significant effect on your chance of making it to 100. The E4 variant is significantly underrepresented in centenarians compared to the general population – because many of those carrying APOE4 died of heart disease, dementia and so on before making it to their 100th birthday. It’s not a guaranteed death sentence – there are a handful of centenarians even with the unluckiest E4/E4 genotype – but, if you’re going for a longevity record, it’s an additional hurdle to clear. Studies suggest that those with two E4 genes live slightly fewer years on average than those with E3/E3, while having two E2 genes can extend your life by a little.

The next most promising longevity gene is FOXO3. Not only are variants of it associated with extreme longevity in human centenarians, but there’s also evidence for its importance from model organisms. Thanks to evolutionary conservation, we share many of the same genes with organisms as distant as flies and nematode worms. FOXO3 is very similar to the worm gene daf-16 – which, like daf-2 and age-1 that you’ll remember from Chapter 3, affects lifespan in worms via the insulin signalling pathway. Like their worm counterparts, humans with a favourable FOXO3 variant probably experience a mild genetic simulation of dietary restriction, enjoying effects like increased autophagy which slow their ageing down just enough for these flavours of FOXO3 to be noticeably more common in people who make it to extreme old age.

The other unusual place to look for longevity genes is isolated populations. Imagine you were carrying a hotshot longevity mutation which would add five years to your lifespan. When you died at 91, rather than the 86 you’d have made it to without the mutation, it would be unlikely to come to the attention of the scientific or medical communities – 91 is a good innings, sure, but it’s far from unheard of. If you have a couple of children, you might pass it on to one of them, and they might pass it on to one of their children, and so on. Unless the mutation makes your descendants have more children on average, it won’t spread through the population, but just drift, with any increase or decrease in frequency down to chance alone.

In isolated communities, however, mutations can persist. If there’s not a huge population in which to dilute them, they can come to be present in a substantial fraction of the much smaller population purely by chance. It could spread into different families and, a few generations later, two people who are descendants of the original carrier could meet, fall in love and have children of their own. This phenomenon is what underlies the danger of having children with siblings or cousins – if both parents carry a rare ‘recessive’ version of a disease-causing gene (which is fine if you only carry one copy), there’s a one-in-four chance that their son or daughter will carry two copies, and develop the health problem that mutation causes.

This is exactly the chain of events that led a three-year-old girl, part of the Old Order Amish community in Berne, Indiana, to hospital in the mid-1980s – a trip which would eventually lead to the discovery of a new gene for human longevity. After bumping her head, the girl developed a large pool of blood under her scalp, and surgery to drain it only made things worse – she nearly bled to death. A few years later, surgery for a dental abscess nearly caused her to drown in her own blood. There’s a collection of ‘bleeding disorders’ which could be responsible for blood not clotting to seal up a wound but, one by one, doctors eliminated them. This girl’s condition was something that, at that time, was unknown to medical science. It was only due to the persistence of a doctor and blood-clotting specialist named Amy Shapiro that the underlying cause of her bleeding was uncovered.

Trawling the literature for clues, Shapiro read about a protein called PAI-1 which is involved in blood clotting. She eventually managed to persuade a colleague to test the sequence of the gene that codes for it, SERPINE1, in the girl’s DNA. They found a two-letter mistake – the DNA-copying process had stuttered, turning a TA into a TATA. This tiny change meant that she was totally lacking working PAI-1, causing her blood-clotting issue, but she seemed entirely normal otherwise. Further testing showed that her parents had one copy of the mutated SERPINE1 each, meaning that they produced less PAI-1 than usual – and they seemed to be entirely unaffected, with even their blood clotting in the usual way.

Other research had found that people with higher levels of PAI-1, caused by a different mutation, were at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This leads to a natural question：if more PAI-1 is worse, is less better? The Amish community in Berne provided an ideal test case, and Shapiro applied to the National Institutes of Health for funding to perform a study. Her grant application was rejected：the NIH didn’t think 100 subjects would be enough to discern a statistically robust effect. How wrong they were. In 2015, almost two hundred Amish people volunteered for a battery of medical tests examining their blood and heart health. Those with a single copy of the mutated SERPINE1 gene had slightly better cardiovascular health than those with two copies of the regular gene along, interestingly, with longer telomeres. They were also much less likely to get diabetes – eight of the 127 non-carriers had diabetes, against zero of the 43 with the mutation. Most strikingly, using genetic testing and family trees to deduce the genotype of relatives who had already died, the study found that people with the mutation lived ten years longer on average than those with two copies of the normal gene, boosting average lifespan from 75 to 85 years.

How is this possible? Well, in the intervening decades since its discovery we’ve learned that PAI-1 is a protein which isn’t just involved in blood clotting; like most genes, it is involved in a number of different processes around the body. Perhaps most crucially when it comes to ageing, PAI-1 is associated with cellular senescence：it’s both involved in a cell’s internal decision-making when it considers becoming senescent, and it’s a component of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by which senescent cells wreak their havoc around the body. Dialling down the odds of senescence and the potency of the SASP are both plausible ways to extend lifespan. While the carriers of a single copy of the mutation seem not to have any problems with blood clotting, it’s also possible that a slightly less eager clotting system might be of benefit as you get older, reducing the odds of problems like stroke.

We should still be a bit cautious about PAI-1 reduction. Though the effect is impressive, it was found in a small population, and the result could still be a fluke, or something highly Amish-specific. Regardless, this surprising lifespan increase should cause us to revisit our expectations about how large an effect single genes can have on longevity in humans. As we saw in Chapter 3, those 1970s evolutionary biologists who thought that mutations in single genes could necessarily have only very small effects on lifespan were quite wrong – and PAI-1 proves that not only were they wrong in worms, but also in people.

As well as the Amish, there are many other isolated populations worth studying. We have already met the Ecuadorians with a growth hormone receptor mutation leading to Laron syndrome (which combines short stature with substantial reductions in cancer and diabetes). Ashkenazi Jews have also been the subject of much study, and have shown that less extreme growth-hormone-related mutations than those behind Laron syndrome are also linked to long life. A woman in a huge extended family in Colombia, many of whom are predisposed to get Alzheimer’s in their forties, made headlines in 2019 because she managed to evade the condition for decades longer than her relatives – seemingly because of an exceptionally rare mutation in both of her APOE genes. Populations with a restricted gene pool will undoubtedly continue to provide intriguing results for both biogerontologists and scientists studying many other aspects of human biology.

Our search for longevity-boosting genes can also be informed by an understanding of what the genes actually do based on work in the lab. There’s a long list of genes that, when either disabled or provided in additional copies, extend the lives of model organisms like worms, flies and mice. We’ve already met a few of these, such as age-1 and telomerase, but there are many more to choose from. For example, mice given an extra copy of a gene called Atg5 display increased levels of autophagy, and live 17 per cent longer; there are multiple genes related to growth hormone, like the mutation found in longevity record-holding Laron mice; and a gene called FGF21 which simulates dietary restriction, and can extend mouse lifespan by a third.

So, having scoured the genomes of model organisms, isolated communities and the extremely old for hints as to how we might live longer, how might we make use of this knowledge? The traditional way is to develop drugs to mimic the effect of a beneficial genetic change. In the case of PAI-1, for example, it seems from the tale of the Old Order Amish that we don’t need as much of it in our body as we normally have. Thus, scientists are looking for drugs which inhibit PAI-1, molecules which will gum up the protein and stop it carrying out its functions. One drug now under development improves diabetes, blood cholesterol and fatty liver disease in overweight mice, and has passed preliminary safety tests in people.

Creating drugs which interfere with the action of particular proteins is the classic way to implement findings in genetics, and has been the basis of many medical breakthroughs over the last few decades. However, there is also a more radical approach：gene therapy. Gene therapy is the idea that we could go in and tweak our DNA – directly add new genes, remove ones we don’t want, or replace defective ones with better alternatives. Gene therapy can be more permanent than drugs：if the DNA is ‘integrated’ into your genome, it will remain there indefinitely, and there’s no need to take the medicine every day. It also has the potential to reduce side effects：drugs will often have ‘off-target’ effects, interfering with proteins or processes they’re not meant to in addition to the intended ones; a gene therapy for a single gene will, by definition, only affect the gene itself – and, though single gene changes can of course cause wider knock-on effects, it may well be less than a drug that hits multiple proteins and pathways simultaneously.

Unfortunately, gene therapy in adult organisms is difficult. The first problem is getting the new genes and editing machinery into potentially trillions of cells. We don’t yet have the tools to reliably edit every cell in the human body, which means that, if your proposed edit relies on universality, you’re in trouble. The most common ‘vectors’ for inserting DNA are viruses, whose modus operandi is to insert their own genetic information into our cells to produce copies of themselves. If you strip out the viral genes and replace them with a gene you’d like to insert, the virus will obligingly deliver that instead. However, our immune systems are always on the lookout for invading viruses and can sometimes overreact：it was a disproportionate immune response to the viral vector, rather than the gene therapy itself, which caused the death of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999. Jesse was an 18-year-old who received one of the first experimental gene therapies, but died four days later. This tragedy caused a massive reputational setback to the field. There’s also the risk of the wrong piece of DNA being altered and, as always, the risk of cancer if some aspect of the DNA editing goes awry.

However, huge strides are being made in gene editing both because it’s very useful for scientists doing experiments in the lab, and because it has huge therapeutic potential. A technology called CRISPR has made headlines – and indeed the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for co-discoverers Emanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna – because it makes gene editing more precise and far cheaper, and has already found its way into human trials to treat disease. It has been limited to making modifications outside of the body for now, meaning that cells can be safety-tested before being put back into patients. There’s also a buzz around adeno-associated virus (or AAV) – which was used to deliver telomerase to adult mice in the previous chapter – thanks to its ability to evade the immune system, and to provide a DNA payload which doesn’t ‘integrate’ into the genome, reducing the risk of cancer. There are a handful of approved AAV therapies, and hundreds more in human trials.

A study published in 2019 took the first step in using AAV gene therapy to treat multiple age-related diseases in adult mice. Trying three different genes identified in studies of ageing, both individually and in combination, the most successful formulation combined a gene which reduces levels of TGF-beta, one of the bad factors identified in old blood we discussed in the previous chapter, and FGF21, which we mentioned is a gene which mimics DR. Mice given this dual gene therapy lost weight whether they were young and fed a high-fat diet or obese due to older age, saw a reduction in diabetes, and recovered better when kidney or heart failure were induced.

The study authors have founded a company in the US called Rejuvenate Bio with the intention of commercialising combination gene therapies against ageing, and the next step is to try them in dogs – in particular, Cavalier King Charles spaniels which suffer a high rate of age-related heart problems. If trials are successful, the plan is to get the therapy up-and-running in pets, aided by simplified regulatory approval, and their shorter lifespan allowing results to be obtained more quickly. The market for these treatments for animals is expected to be worth billions of dollars, and revenues could then be used to develop human versions.

As well as adding extra copies of beneficial genes, there’s also the possibility of reducing our load of detrimental ones. One example is PCSK9, a gene responsible for controlling the amount of cholesterol in our blood. A study in Dallas, Texas, found in 2005 that some African Americans had very low levels of LDL ‘bad’ cholesterol, caused by a mutation which disabled the gene. Further research found that this mutation – which occurs in about 3 per cent of African Americans but less than one in 1,000 Americans of European descent – resulted in a staggering 88 per cent reduction in the risk of heart disease. This led to a race to develop drugs to reduce its activity in the rest of us, and ‘PCSK9 inhibitors’ are now considered the gold standard in cholesterol-reducing medication, used in people with high cholesterol that can’t be controlled by statins (including people with one of several PCSK9 mutations that increase rather than decrease its activity). Trials have begun with PCSK9 ‘RNA interference’ technology, which intercepts the RNA molecules that are the intermediary allowing DNA to be turned into proteins; this could reduce levels of PCSK9 for months at a time with a single dose. If these can reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk without problematic side effects, the next step could be to disable the gene entirely. This has already been shown to work in mice using CRISPR, and a company called Verve Therapeutics is developing a version of this therapy for human trials.

Finally, there’s scope for modifying our existing genes to optimise them for longevity. One option for small changes is a modified version of CRISPR known as ‘base editing’, which allows changing of a single DNA letter at a specific point in the genome. One promising target for this therapy in the not-too-distant future would be APOE：the E3 variant differs from both E2 and E4 by just a single DNA letter. We also already know that different variants can coexist in the same person without disastrous consequences and, even better, E4 is bad (and E2 good) in a ‘dose-dependent’ manner – two copies is worse (or better) than one, which is worse (or better) than zero. Thus, even if you didn’t manage to edit every single copy of APOE, it’s quite likely that you’d still see a positive effect.

If we’re to realise the power of gene therapy for ageing, we need to do more work to understand how these genes work individually and in combination. The 2019 study treating age-related diseases in mice also looked at a third gene, Klotho, an extra copy of which can extend mouse lifespan by about 25 per cent (it takes its name from Clotho, one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology who spun, measured and chopped threads to determine the length of human lives). However, using all three genes together actually reduced the effectiveness of the treatment：the study found that Klotho and FGF21 don’t play nicely together. In biology, the whole is often not the same as the sum of the parts – it can either be greater or, as in this case, lesser, for reasons which are rarely obvious at the outset.

In the long run, gene therapy is likely to have a huge role in medicine. The possibility of more targeted treatments which don’t depend on people remembering to take tablets every day is significant enough, before we consider the ability to modify human biology by adding extra health-giving features which aren’t available in our natural genome. The good news for those of us hoping to treat ageing with gene therapy is that the field as a whole continues to move very quickly, with new clinical trials being announced at a very rapid pace. As is now a familiar story, they will start out being used in patients at serious risk of disease – such as using CRISPR to modify PCSK9 in patients with such high cholesterol that they are at risk of a heart attack in their thirties or forties. If those patients avoid side effects, including the risk of cancer thanks to modifications gone wrong, we could gradually see their use being expanded to cover people with less serious health problems, like age- or diet-related high cholesterol, and eventually maybe all of us will receive PCSK9-modifying therapy as a preventative ‘vaccine’ for high cholesterol.

Looking to the further future, gene therapy could be used to radically re-engineer human biology. We’ve seen in previous chapters how it might help to give our cells copies of genes which aren’t present in any human’s DNA, such as novel enzymes to break down undegradable waste in our lysosomes, or backup copies of at-risk mitochondrial genes. Even these are primitive compared to what we could eventually hope to do with genes, genuinely reprogramming our biology. We could create entirely new genetic ‘circuits’ that, rather than just pumping out a protein, can respond to changes in our bodies and stabilise our biology in the face of the destabilising effects of ageing. Though our lifespans are not heavily determined by our natural genetics at the moment, gene modifications reprogramming our cells’ capabilities will probably be a significant component in how we ultimately go about curing ageing. We’ll discuss this in far greater detail in the final part of this chapter. First, we’ll examine the radical effect of just four genes which have the power to reverse ageing in cells … and maybe whole bodies, too.
