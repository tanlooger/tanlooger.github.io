title: Reprogramming biology and curing ageing
---




Ageing is a phenomenally complex process. Nonetheless, as we’ve seen in the last few chapters, we have good ideas as to how we might treat it. All these ideas have, at a minimum, precedent in the lab, and most of them aren’t just speculative treatments based on theory or experiments on cells in a dish.

If we could get several, most or even all of these treatments working as preventative medicines for people, it would be a massive achievement. It would be very likely to significantly improve health in old age, and certain to make a huge contribution to our understanding of which are the most significant contributors to ageing, and how these different phenomena interact. However, impressive though this would be, I don’t think it would cure ageing on its own.

You’ll have noticed throughout this book that many of the changes associated with ageing are connected：senescent cells have wide-ranging effects thanks to their pro-inflammatory SASP, impacting signalling, the immune system and cancer risk, all while being caused by things we’ve met elsewhere – short telomeres, DNA damage and mutations – which we can also imagine treating directly; stem cells crop up repeatedly, as treatments, as something which we could use signals to fix in old age and, just now, as the inspiration behind cellular reprogramming; chronic inflammation is both a cause and an effect of cellular senescence, immune ageing, and so on. The hallmarks of ageing are the names of key interchanges on a biological network more like a map of the London Underground than a bulleted list – and it will take some work to establish the precise route of every Tube line, and identify every station.

To truly cure ageing, we need to take a more holistic, ‘systems biology’ approach. We need to understand that our cells and bodies aren’t made up of a collection of isolated phenomena, each of which can be fixed one at a time, but a complex system of components interacting in tangled networks with each other and even themselves.

The therapeutic ideas we’ve discussed tackle individual hallmarks of the ageing process, eliminating one kind of cell or returning something that changes with age to more youthful levels. Even if they are beneficial overall, these treatments are very likely to have side effects on the other aspects of our biology. Maybe senolytic drugs will make us live longer, but our first-generation attempts to target them will be slightly overzealous in their cell removal and could eventually result in stem cell exhaustion. We might be able to compensate by adding more stem cells, or using telomerase, altered signals or epigenetic reprogramming to encourage existing ones to divide a few more times, which might put our mitochondria out of kilter, or do something weird to our kidneys or brain. All treatments have unintended consequences, as doctors are all too aware.

We are going to have to learn to reprogram human biology. As we begin to understand how its different components interact, we will gradually find more intelligent ways to intervene. Our biology involves interactions of molecules within individual cells, within and between whole populations of cells, with the extracellular matrix they sit on, with the immune system, the brain, our genes, our environment, and so on. Tweaking one part of this system will send ripples out into the others. We need to make sure that those ripples stabilise the system overall：we can’t just focus narrowly on success measured against whatever they were designed to target directly.

The other reason we need to approach human biology in this holistic way is that individual humans are quite different. Mice in a lab are often genetically identical and raised in exactly the same environment as one another, meaning that any two mice will have a far more similar profile of age-related changes than any two humans. We’ll need more advanced ways to measure whether your genetics, lifestyle, environment or just luck have predisposed you to, say, mitochondrial mutations in your lungs while leaving you with lower than average levels of sugar-modified collagen in your arteries, for example, and give whatever treatments we devise for those in proportion to your own personal spectrum of age-related changes, how you will react to the treatments, and whether you’ll be particularly susceptible to any given side effect.

Cellular reprogramming is a glimpse of what a systems approach to treating ageing could look like, albeit a very simple one which we’ve happened across almost by accident. The four Yamanaka factors are so named because they’re ‘transcription factors’, which is a biological term meaning that they are genes whose function is to influence the behaviour of many other genes. They are not workers on the factory floor, but high-level managers whose invocation has far-reaching cellular implications – as it would have to, given that you can entirely reset a cell’s identity by summoning them. The result is that just four genes can perform a monumentally complex task whose details we still don’t fully understand, all by using existing biological circuitry inside cells.

The Yamanaka factors were found by trial and error but, if we understood this cellular circuitry, we’d be in a position to rewire it in a far more purposeful way. If we could understand how circuits inside cells send and receive signals between cells, our reprogramming would become smarter as we began to untangle the consequences of the changes we’re making around the whole body. Once we can integrate this broader knowledge with the ways age-related changes affect these systems, we’d be in a position to develop smart treatments with maximum benefit and the minimum of side effects.

Perhaps we’d activate two of the Yamanaka factors in the liver, heart and intestines, reduce the activity of three entirely different genes in some kinds of cell in the brain and add a new gene we’d custom-built for a particular task in the immune system; maybe later, we could insert a small package of artificial DNA with its own programmable logic, doing x if it’s in a cell where y is high and, if not, z and a in proportion to levels of something else. These kinds of programs are how our cells already work, with transcription factors regulating which other genes are turned on and off depending on the environment, signals and other transcription factors, so it’s not implausible – even if gaining the understanding and technological prowess to do it ourselves will be challenging. If we truly master a systems-based approach to biology, it may well be very hard to describe the complex therapies we devise except in some kind of systems biology programming language：narrative language isn’t designed to express the ludicrous complexity of emergent phenomena arising between vast numbers of interacting actors, but mathematics is. The increasing mathematisation of biology will expand our ability to describe and then predict its complexity in ways that words simply cannot capture.

Once we have the models which would allow us to predict these outcomes, biology will be transformed. Initial research will no longer be conducted in vitro (literally ‘in glass’ – meaning cells in a dish or molecules in a test tube) or in vivo (in living things like worms, flies and mice) but in silico：in a computer. We are already taking the first small steps towards in silico biomedicine, and advanced models and simulations will eventually allow us to test all kinds of theories far more quickly and reproducibly than messy lab biology, and only the most promising therapies will need to be evaluated in slow, expensive trials in mice or people.

If this sounds futuristic, that’s because it is. We are just starting to understand how networks of genes interact inside cells, and how signals are sent around the body. We’re some way off building detailed, predictive models for human biology. That said, it’s important to put the potential timescales into perspective. Even if you think the first actionable predictions of these computer models may be 50 years away, it’s still important to lay the groundwork now：50 years is still soon enough to benefit billions of people alive today, especially if we can add years to healthy life expectancy with some of the therapies already on the drawing board. And, though a fully fledged model of all of human biology could be even further away than that, it’s also quite likely that the first attempts which, though imperfect, build and improve upon our current ways of doing medicine will come sooner.

In 2012, scientists created a computer model which could simulate a bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium. This, as the name suggests, is a sexually transmitted bug which also holds the title of smallest known self-replicating bacterium. As a single cell with just 525 genes (we humans have around 20,000), this is as simple an organism as you can model – but, as well as explaining existing experimental observations, the model was able to predict behaviours that had never been observed before which were then corroborated in the lab. It’s small but it’s a start, proving the principle that computers can simulate biological systems. The C. elegans simulation we mentioned in Chapter 3 is perhaps the next step, though moving from one cell in a bacterium, to 959 cells in a worm, to tens of trillions in humans will undoubtedly be a challenge.

There are some examples of simple computational and systems medicine approaches being used in humans. One example is HIV treatment, where mathematical models allowed scientists to establish how fast different stages of HIV’s life cycle progressed – and, once these models uncovered how fast the virus replicates and mutates, it became clear that multiple drugs could be used simultaneously to stop the virus rapidly evolving resistance to single treatments. Though a cure for HIV remains elusive, modern combination therapies inspired by this insight can keep the number of viruses in patients sufficiently low that they can lead relatively normal lives, including safely having sex without a condom without putting their partner at risk of infection. There are other examples at an earlier stage where researchers have started using machine learning models to uncover new uses for existing drugs by looking at which proteins they affect, the drugs’ molecular structures and so on, and predicting other uses they could be put to, either individually or in combination. One recent study used this approach to train a computer model to recognise the characteristics of a list of known DR mimetics, then used it to identify other drugs which might have similar life-extending effects.

The technology underlying these models is growing at an exponential rate. Firstly, our ability to collect the kinds of data we need is growing incredibly quickly. Genome sequencing is the poster child of biological data collection, and it’s getting rapidly cheaper：in 2001, just after the completion of the Human Genome Project, sequencing a human genome cost about $100,000,000; by 2008, the price had dropped a hundredfold to $1,000,000; in 2019, a whole-genome sequence cost under $1,000. Genome sequencing and related techniques are known as ‘omics’ technologies. These techniques are said to be ‘unbiased’ because you don’t have to choose in advance exactly what you’re looking for：rather than sequencing a single gene thought to be involved in a process, or measuring levels of a particular protein as we would have done in the past, we can look across the whole genome (with genomics) or all the proteins in a given population of cells (known as proteomics), and so on. This offers far greater opportunities to find the unexpected, and to see how cells and organisms behave as interconnected biological systems.

We also have an exponentially increasing ability to process this kind of data. Computing power has doubled every two years since the 1960s, as famously observed in Gordon Moore’s eponymous law. A similar, albeit less smooth trend has given us dramatic improvements in computer storage at an even faster rate. It would be a mistake to extrapolate these trends into the indefinite future, as we are likely to run into physical limits relatively soon – the last half-century of processing power improvements has been driven by making the components on microchips ever smaller, and we are approaching the minimum size permitted by the laws of physics. But we should be able to continue advances in data-crunching speed by making algorithms more efficient, making chips optimised for particular tasks like machine learning, and using new technologies like quantum computing.

Though past performance is no guarantee of future success, trends like these make it seem quite plausible that we’ll have both the vast amounts of data and the computational chops to process it that we’d need to create detailed models of human biology. Given how far we’ve come in the last 50 years, it would be foolish to bet that the kind of systems biology we’d need to cure ageing won’t be possible in the next 50.

The idea of cellular reprogramming is captivating. It makes me oscillate wildly between wondering if we just might have got incredibly lucky and, thanks to Yamanaka, been handed a cheat code for cellular biology, or whether its apparent success in the lab is a cruel joke played by nature, presaging a string of frustrating failures to turn it into practical treatments. However, even though it’s not really a systems biology approach, it shows us the way：a seemingly sideways intervention in a bunch of genes which have no obvious role in ageing, but whose combination allows a substantial reversal of the arrow of time.

Regardless of whether this first iteration of reprogramming results in a useful therapy, I believe that our entire approach to biomedicine will ultimately be best described as reprogramming：we’ll need to quantify and utilise the interactions between the uncountable elements of our biology, add new features where our own genes don’t already have the tools, and do all of this in a programmatic way, assisted in this unfathomably complex task by enormous computer models. (This, incidentally, is why some techno-futurists think that curing ageing is better achieved by focusing on advances in computing power and artificial intelligence rather than biology. In reality, we will almost certainly need to do both – even the most advanced machine learning we could imagine running on inconceivably powerful computers needs real-world data on which to base its models.)

The logical endpoint of the process will be to gradually retire the idea of treating ‘ageing’ and begin to see all human dysfunction and disease as a ‘loss of homeostasis’. Homeostasis is the collective term for the myriad processes which keep aspects of our physiology, from temperature and blood sugar to levels of proteins and numbers of a particular kind of cell, within the astonishingly narrow parameters needed to keep us alive. A 20- or 30-something human is in a state of very nearly perfect homeostasis, with odds of their system falling so far out of balance that they die less than one in 1,000 annually. If we could just return our physiological parameters to where they are in young adulthood, we’d be able to rely on our bodies’ existing homeostatic systems to keep us alive.

The processes we currently label ageing are a very gradual loss of homeostasis – far slower than, for example, the urgent need to start shivering when out in the cold to keep your body temperature within its safe range – but they reflect the fact that evolution doesn’t need to maintain balance in our bodies into our sixth or seventh decade. The almost imperceptible unravelling of the near-equilibrium state we all enjoy in youth is why we become frail, forgetful and susceptible to disease. The best treatments for ageing would gently nudge the network of processes causing us to gradually lose homeostasis back towards a stable state, keeping us safe and healthy for decades longer than we enjoy today. Intervening in clever ways to restore order to the whole system is surely the eventual future of medicine.

Unravelling the systems biology of ageing is going to take incomprehensible quantities of data, enormous computing power and smart computational biologists working in tandem with those in the lab. Replacing narrative with numerical representation has revolutionised whole fields of science in the past, and the data and computational revolution in biology has only just begun.

Once we can model our biology in detail, we will be able to reprogram it to stop the gradual decrease in health and increase in risk of death with time. Human beings will finally be negligibly senescent, biologically immortal – ageless. The treatments that result will bring to an end the huge economic and human cost of natural selection’s negligence, and the pain and suffering in old age which has been an inevitability for most living things for millions of years. It’s a bold mission, but not an unachievable one：human biology is incredibly complex, but it is also finite. One day, data and powerful computer models will enable us to edit the very code we run on. Reprogramming ageing will be our greatest achievement as a species. It should be our collective mission, as biologists, as doctors and as human beings.
