title: Turning back the epigenetic clock
---




Throughout this book we’ve learned that the process of ageing is surprisingly malleable. Whether it’s dietary restriction, genetic changes or sewing a mouse to a younger one, the rate of ageing can be slowed; with senolytic drugs, telomerase and other therapies in development, we may be able to reverse it. This is incredibly exciting news, and I hope it has by now changed your view on both ageing and medicine. But perhaps the plasticity of ageing shouldn’t be so surprising. Ageing is a solved problem, after all：even if their parents are old, babies are born young.

No matter whether her parents are in their teens or their forties, a baby is born at age zero, with brand-new organs and skin as smooth as … well, a baby’s. Babies inherit their parents’ DNA, but not their chronological age. This is a key part of disposable soma theory from Chapter 2 – while our bodies are expendable, the ‘germline’ cells involved in reproduction can’t be if your species is to survive. The germline is immortal：the fact that you’re reading this means that your parents, their parents before them, and an uninterrupted and unfathomably lengthy lineage of great-great-great- … great-grandparents, right back to single-celled organisms on the early Earth, all successfully had children – and they must have been biologically young enough to have children of their own. The successful preservation of the germline over several billion years isn’t technically immortality, but it’s not a bad start.

On one level, this is maddening. We all have the tools to build an entirely new, fresh life written in our DNA, and yet we clearly don’t have the tools to perform what seems like the far simpler task of keeping what’s already built running. It’s all very well that mother nature can do this with newborns, but can we uncover her tools and make use of them in medicine?

We’ve actually already discussed one of the methods by which science could make this exciting idea possible. In Chapter 6, we met the process of deriving induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, the incredible multitalented precursor cells which we can make from regular differentiated body cells. Since this process was discovered, we’ve found out that inducing pluripotency seems to rejuvenate cells in a way that mimics the magic tricks nature uses to grant babies their youth. The process of making iPSCs is known as ‘reprogramming’ the cells, and thus this idea is known as rejuvenation by reprogramming.

The first line of evidence for this rejuvenation is the epigenetic clock, the freakishly accurate predictor of biological age based on epigenetic marks on your DNA we met in Chapter 4. Steve Horvath actually found this in the 2013 paper where he announced his clock. Having established that it worked over many different types of tissue, he made one final test of its predictive power：he used it to calculate the epigenetic age of both embryonic stem cells – ‘naturally’ young cells isolated from a human embryo just a few days after sperm met egg – and iPSCs, derived from cells obtained from adults. The embryonic cells had an epigenetic age close to zero, which makes sense. The adult cells used to make the iPSCs had a normal epigenetic age corresponding to that of their donor, which also makes sense. But the iPSCs themselves were epigenetically zero years old – their biological clock had been reset, making them indistinguishable from their embryonic counterparts.

Experiments since have doubled down on this finding：fully functional iPSCs have been successfully derived from people as old as 114, and the cells have an epigenetic age of zero whether the donor was a young adult or a centenarian. Even better, differentiating these iPSCs into specific cell types leaves their epigenetic youthfulness intact. This means that you can take a 90-year-old’s skin cells, make iPSCs and differentiate them back into skin cells again – and those new skin cells will themselves be young. This is already brilliant news：it could up the effectiveness of all the stem cell therapies we’ve got planned if we can use iPSCs as the source of the donor cells – the new brain cells, eye cells, blood stem cells or whatever we produced from them would be young again, ready for another few decades of use and abuse.

Even better, it appears that the epigenetic reset doesn’t occur in isolation but is accompanied by other rejuvenative effects. The iPSCs also have better-looking mitochondria, and lower levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. They also have longer telomeres, comparable to those found in embryonic stem cells. This is all almost suspiciously great news：by inserting extra copies of just four genes – the ‘Yamanaka factors’, known as O, K, S and M, the discovery of which earned Yamanaka the Nobel – we seem to be able to reactivate a molecular deep-cleaning process analogous to that which undoes the ravages of time in the germline.

There are some caveats：for example, there’s a faint epigenetic shadow which allows iPSCs made from young and old donors to be distinguished, though it seems to fade if you let the iPSCs divide a few times. However, even if the details are still being ironed out, the process of inducing pluripotency seems to reliably reverse the ageing process in cells. That’s exciting – but can you do it in whole animals?

The first piece of good news is something we mentioned in Chapter 6：you can inject iPSCs into a mouse embryo and generate a fully functional mouse. This is pretty solid evidence that they behave exactly as regular embryonic cells do – and, in particular, that they’re not prematurely aged somehow in a way that stops the newborn mice from functioning properly or causes them to die young. We can also examine the lifespan of cloned animals. Dolly the sheep was cloned from her ‘mother’ by taking the nucleus from an adult cell and then inserting it into an egg whose nucleus had been destroyed. Her birth led to speculation about life for clones in general – born from old DNA, even transplanted into a young egg, could she have a normal life, and lifespan?

Six and a half years later, the answer seemed clear：Dolly had to be put to sleep after she developed a cough, and a follow-up X-ray revealed multiple tumours on her lungs. This is an unusually brief innings for a Finn-Dorset sheep, a breed which often lives to nine or more. She was also diagnosed with arthritis when she was five – again, unusually early – and a measurement of her telomeres when she was one year old had shown that they were shorter than those of other young sheep. All this together led scientists to suspect that starting with an adult cell nucleus from a six-year-old mother may have meant that Dolly started life with a biological handicap, eventually leading to premature ageing and a stunted lifespan.

However, subsequent work has overturned this supposition. A more thorough study looking at 13 cloned sheep, four of whom were genetically identical sisters of Dolly cloned from the same cells, found that they were all ageing pretty normally in their dotage. Aged between seven and nine at the time of the study, a thorough ovine medical found their cardiovascular health, blood test results and joints to be similar to non-cloned sheep of the same vintage. It might well be that Dolly just got unlucky – aged four, she’d caught a respiratory virus known to cause lung cancer which was sweeping through the flock at the Roslin Institute where she lived. It’s pretty likely that this was the cause of her tumours, meaning that they weren’t a sign of premature old age after all. Given this simple explanation, which was known at the time of her death, her persistent citation as evidence that clones die young seems rather peculiar.

Experiments with mice have gone further, first cloning a mouse, and then taking a nucleus from a cell of the clone and putting it into an egg cell again to make a clone of the clone … and so on. Early studies seemed to show that the success rate dropped with each ‘generation’, so cloning a clone was harder than simply cloning a ‘normal’ mouse had been, and cloning the clone of a clone was harder still. One meticulous attempt to understand this eventually made it to the sixth generation, which took an incredibly frustrating 1,000 attempts to get a single live baby mouse – only for its foster mother to promptly eat it, ending the experiment. It’s hard to imagine what it must be like to meticulously inject 1,000 nuclei into egg cells, finally have it implant successfully in a mouse womb, wait out the pregnancy … and then for mum to chow down this tiny piece of scientific history before you’ve had chance to run any tests.

However, cloning techniques have since improved significantly, and this decreasing efficiency with each generation has disappeared. A group overseen by the same scientist who witnessed that appalling act of mouse cannibalism published a paper in 2013 documenting the success of repeated cloning over 25 generations with no obvious increase in difficulty over time. Most crucially from our point of view, the great-great- … great-grandclones were healthy and had normal lifespans. Once again, the magic of cellular reprogramming resets the ageing clock with each generation. (The experiment continues and, at the time of writing, is on generation 43.)

The final piece of evidence for rejuvenation by reprogramming hails not from the lab, but the ocean. The jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii is a half-centimetre, 90-tentacled sea creature also known as (spoiler alert) the ‘immortal jellyfish’. Its immortality is granted by a two-way life cycle, where adult jellyfish (known as the ‘medusa’ phase) can do a Benjamin Button and age backwards to the junior, ‘polyp’ stage. This seems to happen by a process of cellular dedifferentiation. The polyp can then grow up all over again, becoming a betentacled medusa once more, ready to repeat the process of ageing backwards whenever life’s cumulative stresses get too much for it. This jelly-phoenix shows us that having a baby isn’t the only way that biology has found to turn back the clock – it’s possible to do it to a complete adult body of aged cells, too.

There’s an obvious problem with us humans adopting the jellyfish’s strategy. Reprogramming cells wholesale in a live human would result in cells in all our vital organs – lungs, heart, liver, kidneys – losing their function and turning into pluripotent stem cells. Stem cells might be powerful in terms of their potential, but they’re hopeless in practical roles, like pumping blood round your body. Generating undifferentiated cells willy-nilly would result in catastrophic organ failure and rapid death. The other risk, if the organ failure didn’t get you, would be total wipeout from teratomas – the disgusting matted-hair-eyes-and-teeth tumours formed by pluripotent cells. Even a single iPSC in a live organism can be deadly, so purposely inducing them body-wide would be catastrophic.

This isn’t just a grim theoretical prediction – we’ve tried it in mice, with exactly those results. Multiple cancers and organ failure blighted two experiments attempting to make in vivo iPSCs published in 2013 and 2014. However, a couple of years later, a more subtle approach enjoyed greater success. Scientists took mice genetically engineered to have both a premature ageing disorder and extra copies of the Yamanaka genes in their cells which would only be turned on if they were taking a particular drug. After letting them develop normally and begin to show signs of premature ageing, the drug was administered. If administered continuously, the poor mice only lasted a few days before being overwhelmed by organ failure – this turned on the genes continuously, and was effectively a repeat of previous attempts. Lest this sounds like a needlessly cruel rerun of an experiment with a known outcome, the scientists did have a plan：this time, they were searching for a safe duration of Yamanaka factor activation which would turn back the ageing process a little without sending the mice full jellyfish. When they reduced the dose to two days on, five days off, things looked very different. This cyclic activation of the Yamanaka factors improved their heart function, speeded recovery of both muscle and pancreas from injury, made them look younger and added 30 per cent to their lifespan overall.

This was very much a proof-of-principle experiment：as we’ve discussed before, mice suffering from premature ageing are not the ideal model for this kind of study because it might be easier to fix what you broke than to perform the same feat in the slow-motion chaos of normal ageing. Nonetheless, it’s an exciting result：this ridiculous-sounding treatment, activating a bunch of genes discovered for an entirely different purpose almost a decade previously, seems to do something important to the ageing process.

The excitement generated by this preliminary finding means that follow-up work is starting to fill in the gaps. We’ve shown that this isn’t a mechanism confined to mice. Human cells in a dish subjected to transient activation of the Yamanaka factors and a couple of other genes show an across-the-board turning back of their biological clocks but, crucially, without losing their cellular identities. The process knocked a few years off their epigenetic clocks, pepped up their mitochondria, increased levels of autophagy … the only thing that wasn’t changed was telomere length, which is probably actually a positive, because it means that the cells hadn’t been reprogrammed into iPSCs with active telomerase. This work also showed that human muscle stem cells extracted from the body, transiently reprogrammed and then injected into mice can help aged muscles regenerate. Transient reprogramming has been shown to improve healing of eye injuries in middle-aged mice. We also now know that reprogramming can be delivered and activated safely in adult mice over the medium term：five-month-old mice given OKS (without the M) gene therapy have survived for over a year without obvious ill effects. Things are moving so fast with reprogramming that there will probably be some new findings by the time you read this.

These results are encouraging, but far too preliminary for you to go down to your doctor and demand a prescription for OKSM (quite apart from the fact that they’d look at you quizzically because there’s no way to deliver them to humans yet). The key to turning this into treatments will be to unpick what’s actually happening as we induce pluripotency, and in what order. Experiments on cells in a dish show that it’s a multi-step process：the first stage seems to be scrubbing off the epigenetic signs of old age, and it’s only after that has been largely completed that the cell begins its dedifferentiation journey proper, from adult cell to stem cell. It needn’t be this way – the process of epigenetic clock reversal could easily be simultaneous with that of dedifferentiation, or it might be that a cell has to get all the way to being an iPSC cell before it begins its spring cleaning. Luckily for us, the Yamanaka factors’ path to pluripotency seems to be ordered favourably for those proof-of-principle experiments in mice we have just looked at：it means that two days’ worth can turn back the ageing clock, but stopping the drug after that means their cells don’t have long enough to dedifferentiate and kill the mice in multiple unpleasant ways.

The fact that these things happen sequentially rather than all at once also suggests that they are at least somewhat independent, which means we could envisage genes or drugs which affect a cell’s ageing without affecting what type of cell it is. An ideal outcome could be a pill which resets all the age-related changes, but which leaves it as whatever type of cell it was originally, doing its good work in the body.

We can actually already do the opposite – changing a cell’s identity without changing its biological age – by a process called ‘transdifferentiation’, or direct reprogramming. This procedure is very much like generating iPSCs, but a different cocktail of genes turns one type of body cell straight into another – turning a skin cell straight into a neuron, for example – without the iPSC step in between. This could be very useful medically, allowing doctors to turn cells from one plentiful type to another which is needed in the body without going via iPSCs and putting the patient at risk of cancer. This is under investigation to generate new insulin-producing cells from other pancreatic cells for patients with diabetes, as well as new heart muscle cells and new neurons. These have the potential to be useful therapies but, more interestingly for us in this context, being able to alter a cell’s identity without changing how old it is provides another piece of evidence that these two things are addressable independently.

There are several ideas to get this working in humans under active investigation. The classic approach would be to try to find a drug which mimics the effects of OKSM, or awakens those genes from their slumber in differentiated cells in the body. Not only is this the traditional way to unleash the power of lab discoveries as medicine, it has the significant advantage of not requiring us to inject a clutch of very powerful genes into our cells. You can always stop taking a drug; it’s much harder to undo changes to your genetic code. Of particular concern is the M in OKSM, also known as c-Myc, because it’s an ‘oncogene’ often aberrantly activated in cancer. There are several approaches to ‘chemically induced reprogramming’ under investigation in the lab, and scientists have successfully made iPSCs, neural stem cells and neurons from adult cells without the need to insert any genes. As we learn more about them, it’s possible that these compounds could be turned into anti-ageing drugs.

There’s also a lot of interest in variations on gene therapy. For those justifiably cautious about c-Myc, the good news is that reprogramming doesn’t seem to need it – as we mentioned a few paragraphs ago, OKS seems to work too, and has been safely used in mice for over a year. Researchers are trying to separate out the effects of O, K, S and M to identify which are active at which stages in reprogramming, what they each do and whether we could get away with even fewer of them. There’s also the opposite approach, using extra genes which have been shown to improve the efficiency of reprogramming of cells in a dish：researchers are adding to the alphabet soup with combinations like OKSMLN (L for LIN28, and N for NANOG, a gene used by embryonic stem cells whose name derives from Tír na nÓg, the land of eternal youth in Irish and Scottish mythology) to find out what their effects are in animals.

There’s even a case for ditching OKSM altogether. Since the discovery of induced pluripotency, iPSCs have been totemic; creating these godlike cells which are able to form any other type of cell has been the abiding goal of much stem cell research. However, iPSCs aren’t necessarily the most useful target – there’s actually no need for cells that versatile given that what we ultimately care about is working adult body cells. Perhaps we shouldn’t rely on Yamanaka’s factors, but search for new genes which turn back the clock to a less primordial stage in cellular development. One suggested timepoint is the so-called embryonic–foetal transition which, in humans, occurs around the eight-week mark during pregnancy. Before it, any injuries to the developing baby heal flawlessly; afterwards, wounds heal imperfectly, leaving scars like those we’re all familiar with after a cut or scrape. Turning back the clock to this stage of life could give our cells improved regenerative powers but, proponents of this idea hope, without the risk of accidentally overshooting into pluripotency, cancer and chaos.

Finally, there are options which step away from the idea of trying to emulate reprogramming. The fact that the first part of reprogramming seems to be the reversal of age-related epigenetic changes adds weight to the idea that epigenetics is a causal mechanism behind the ageing process, rather than simply a clock face giving us a readout of our age. If this is the case, perhaps we’d be better off steering clear of the black magic of the Yamanaka factors and focusing on reprogramming our epigenetics directly. There are now modified versions of CRISPR that can alter epigenetic marks at multiple locations in our DNA simultaneously – and scientists are working on technologies to edit hundreds, or even thousands of sites. That would mean we could think about precision approaches to replicate what OKSM does by brute force. However, the black magic approach retains a certain appeal – if we can let nature’s own tools restore epigenetic order in our cells, we might be able to avoid the troublesome process of working out what exactly needs changing in order to do it ourselves.

Exactly how we’ll disentangle the different kinds of epigenetic and other changes which occur during the wide-ranging process of induced pluripotency and transdifferentiation is yet to be seen. There are undoubtedly years of hard scientific graft ahead of us before we fully unpick the details, but what gives me hope that we might see therapies in years or decades rather than centuries is how easy it seems to have been to stumble upon these phenomena almost by accident. Yamanaka wasn’t seeking a fountain of cellular youth when he found his four factors and generated the world’s first iPSCs：he was specifically looking for something which would revive their ability to differentiate into anything they liked. Our good fortune has been that his OKSM factors seem to do both. But for this serendipitous success, it would be very hard to convince a sceptical scientist that we could turn back the cellular clock by activating just a few genes. The fact that it works is inspiration to go out in search of genes or drugs specifically for their powers to turn back the epigenetic clock, revitalise mitochondria, extend telomeres and so on, which the Yamanaka factors have shown us how to do as a side effect.

Therapies based on careful use of these reprogramming factors, or clever drugs or other treatments which can mimic their effects, may not be so far away. They may even come sooner than some of the otherwise more straightforward therapies discussed in previous chapters, partly due to the sudden intense interest in therapeutic reprogramming thanks to these promising early results. Using transient reprogramming to turn back the ageing clock is one of the most exciting ideas in biogerontology：it sounds absolutely crazy at first, but the evidence so far suggests it might just work.
