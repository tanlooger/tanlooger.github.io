title: Repelling the attack of the clones

Damage to our DNA, and the mutations that result from it, could be some of the hardest age-related damage we need to fix in our bodies. The first approach we could take is probably the most obvious：repair. The second relies on understanding exactly how mutations cause problems in our ageing bodies, and learning how recent developments in DNA sequencing could overturn old ideas about why mutations matter.

The first, obvious approach would be to improve our DNA repair machinery. Our cells have gone to incredible lengths to ensure that damage to our DNA can be fixed – as we noted in Chapter 4, an average cell is thought to take up to 100,000 hits to its DNA daily, so if even a tiny fraction of those were to stick it could be catastrophic. There’s a mind-blowing array of DNA repair processes involving hundreds of different genes to spot problems, cry for help and excise any damage, showing us without doubt that this is of serious concern to our bodies. However, as we know from our understanding of the evolution of ageing, even something as important as repairing DNA will only be as good as it needs to be to allow us to pass on our genes.

This means that inspiration can be drawn from the animal kingdom, where many animals seem to be more mutation-proof than we are. Take the bowhead whale, whose exceptional longevity we remarked upon in Chapter 2. As well as living for over two centuries, these graceful giants can weigh up to 100 tonnes. In spite of this immense body size, bowhead whale cells are about the same size as cells from a human, or even a mouse; thus, given that they weigh over 1,000 times more than a typical human, they have approximately 1,000 times as many cells as we do. This means they have very roughly 1,000 times as many opportunities for a cell to acquire the mutations that would give rise to cancer, and two or three times longer lifespans for them to do so (more if you consider human lifespans in the wild). In spite of these handicaps, our marine megafauna aren’t riddled with hundreds of tumours. This general rule – that larger animals with more cells and often impressive longevity tend not to succumb to astronomical levels of cancer – was first formulated in 1977 by medical statistician Richard Peto and is known as ‘Peto’s paradox’.

Peto’s observation only seems to be a paradox between species, not within them：there’s evidence that taller people are at greater risk of cancer than shorter ones, and the larger breeds of dog are more cancer-prone than smaller ones, too. In these cases, more cells but the same species-specific cancer defences means a greater likelihood of cancer overall. (Don’t panic, tall people：the stats suggest that you’re at less risk of cardiovascular problems and dementia than short people, so the difference in overall mortality probably comes out in the wash.) This further bolsters the idea that we might learn something from large, long-lived animals：it suggests that mere size doesn’t confer big animals some unknown cancer-protective advantage.

Recent sequencing of the elephant and bowhead whale genomes provide tantalising hints about how we might go about improving our own mutation resistance. The elephant genome contains twenty copies of a gene called p53, while we humans only have one. p53 is the gene most often mutated in cancer, and has been dubbed ‘the guardian of the genome’ thanks to its crucial protective role. It’s a gene with many functions, one of which is to cause apoptosis or senescence in cells whose DNA is badly damaged. Thus, it could be that these additional copies of the gene make elephant cells particularly prone to precautionary suicide, making cancer less likely to develop. Bowhead whales don’t have extra p53, but do have additional copies of or subtle variations in genes responsible for DNA repair, which may make mutations less likely in the first place – there’s more than one way to skin the cat of cancer prevention.

Applying these findings naïvely is a risky business：while removing a copy of p53 from mice does indeed make them dramatically more prone to cancer, adding an extra one causes symptoms of accelerated ageing and reduces their lifespan. It’s hypothesised that the trigger-happy suicide protein causes too many stem cells to die, making the mice cancer-proof but causing them to run out of stem cells prematurely. I certainly won’t be lining up for gene therapy to provide me with an extra copy of p53 given these results, and it’s likely that evolution has made complicated trade-offs between degeneration and cancer prevention that can’t be understood simply by counting numbers of genes. As biologist Leslie Orgel famously noted, evolution is cleverer than you are.

However, this approach is not without hope：you might remember from earlier in this chapter that mice given telomerase plus three DNA-protective genes lived longer than normal ones. One of those protective genes was p53. As we also saw in Chapter 2, evolution hasn’t optimised for longevity, but reproductive success. In the case of these genetically modified mice, perhaps extra p53 causes more cell death, but plenty of other cells with longer telomeres can divide a few more times to cover for their lost peers. Evolution might avoid such an approach because extending telomeres and making extra cells takes a lot of energy, and having the normal complement of both p53 and telomerase already postpones both cancer and stem cell exhaustion to a point long after most mice in the wild are dead. That means we don’t necessarily have to be cleverer than evolution to reap improvements in lifespan：inserting additional copies of single genes might be too simplistic an approach, but it could be that adding or altering a handful of genes, done judiciously, can achieve positive results long before we have a full understanding of how the many protective systems in our cells interact. (We’ll be talking more about gene editing for longevity in the next chapter.)

Improving DNA repair is an approach that is agnostic towards how the damaged DNA and resulting mutations actually go on to affect our bodies：it slows down the accumulation of damage so its consequences should be delayed, too. However, the next class of approaches we could take to save us from mutations depends critically on our emerging understanding of how mutations affect our tissues in old age.

The first suggestions that mutations could contribute to the ageing process were made in the late 1950s, just a few years after the double-helical structure of DNA was discovered in 1953. The idea was that our genetic code would accumulate random mistakes throughout life; since this code gives the instructions to build proteins, these errors would lead to changes in the structure of these proteins; and, as we’ve seen, proteins’ structure dictates their function, so these changes would mean that our cellular components would gradually get less effective with age, quite possibly increasing levels of DNA damage in the process, leading to a vicious cycle which drives ageing.

Modern DNA sequencing technology leads us to question this simple picture. We now know how many mutations cells accumulate over a lifetime – data that scientists even a decade ago could only really guess at – and the numbers don’t quite add up. This shows us that most cells in your body acquire around ten to fifty mutations every year you’re alive. The uniformity across tissues is surprising – whether it’s a cell in the lining of your intestines, constantly dividing and besieged by toxins in food, or a brain cell in its cosseted environment which might not divide for your whole life, almost every cell type we’ve checked falls into this relatively narrow range.

One of a handful of exceptions is sun-exposed skin:* cells from these areas can accrue ten times as many mutations per year. Indeed, skin researchers (nearly) equate skin ageing with sun exposure – how much ultraviolet light a given patch of skin has received over its lifetime is a significant predictor of how biologically old it is. Another place where mutations abound with atypical frequency is the lining of your lungs if you’re a smoker, for obvious reasons.

These mutation rates mean that a 65-year-old might expect to have a couple of thousand mutations in any given cell in their body, and maybe 10,000 in a cell of sun-exposed skin or a smoker’s lung. That sounds like a lot, but it might not be enough to cause widespread problems with proteins：only just over 1 per cent of our DNA codes for proteins,† and cells only use those specific ones that are relevant to their particular function, meaning that the chance of any one mutation falling in a protein-coding region important to a given cell is low; some mutations, known as ‘synonymous’ mutations, won’t make a difference to the protein anyway (this is because there are a number of ways to ‘spell’ each amino acid in the DNA code, so changing a letter won’t make a difference if the resulting ‘word’ codes for the same amino acid); and, finally, because most genes come in two copies – one from each parent – even if a mutation does arise in one, there’s a backup which can usually step in and fill the gap. If you work through the maths, the number of cells which would expect to have problems in both copies of a protein important enough to cause issues is very small – maybe one in every few thousand of our cells. Perhaps mutations aren’t such a big deal after all?

It would come as a significant relief if widespread random mutations aren’t one of the reasons our cells deteriorate with age, because it would be almost impossible to fix. If every cell contained dozens of different mutations which were functionally significant, we’d need to find some technology which could go in and correct the errors, and it’s very hard to envisage what that might be. Even if you imagine creating an artificial mutation-repairing nanobot, it would need to carry a reference copy of your whole genome in its back pocket against which to check every single possible error, and dreaming up such a sci-fi solution would push any hopes of curing ageing back into the twenty-third century.

However, though detailed sequencing of aged genomes makes this scenario seem less likely, it has revealed a more subtle way in which mutations can affect the ageing process. The best way to understand what’s happening is to look at the most famous consequence of mutations in our DNA：cancer.

Fundamentally, cancer is a disease of accumulated mutations. A cancerous cell needs to acquire specific faults in its genome in order to turn into a tumour：perhaps most importantly, it needs to disable genes which cause its cells to stop growing, enable genes which encourage growth, or both; a key part of this, as we’ve seen earlier in this chapter, is to activate telomerase or, occasionally, some other mechanism; as the cancer develops, it will need mutations to grow its own blood supply and suppress the immune system; and, at some stage, most cancers turn off critical DNA repair mechanisms, allowing genetic chaos which enables more mutations, which makes all of these tasks easier. The same maths that says you’d expect very few cells to have even a single crippling mutation in old age tells you that accumulating enough specifically pro-cancerous ones in the same cell is also extremely unlikely in current human lifetimes.

Unfortunately, cancer has an ace up its sleeve：evolution. When a non-cancerous cell acquires what scientists call its first ‘driver’ mutation, the key feature is that it provides the cell with an evolutionary advantage. What an evolutionary advantage means for a cell is the ability to outgrow neighbouring cells with unmutated DNA. Imagine that a normal cell obtains a mutation which disables a gene whose purpose is to stop its growth under particular conditions：it could then start dividing, even though all of the adjacent cells think (correctly) that there’s no need. It might make a few thousand, or even million daughters before some other, still intact growth-modulating process kicks in – our own, whole-organism evolution has equipped us with multiple, highly redundant mechanisms for most cellular functions, not least to reduce the odds of cancer – and this period of rapid growth is brought to a halt. This process of rapid but temporary growth is known as a ‘clonal expansion’, so named because it’s an expansion of cells which are clones of one another, sharing the same driver mutation.

This process of driver mutation followed by clonal expansion makes cancer dramatically more likely. There are now thousands or millions of cells which already contain one driver, making it far more likely that one of them could get ‘lucky’ and acquire a second driver mutation. This second mutation can then cause another clonal expansion, meaning there are now a million cells with two pre-cancerous mutations, ready and waiting for a third … and so on. This is evolution by natural selection, but operating on the cells within organisms：cells with a growth advantage multiply, outcompeting their obedient, rule-following neighbours, repeatedly making the next step on the path to cancer more likely.

Driver mutations are central to our modern understanding of how cancer arises. A millionfold increase in odds at every stage is what makes cancer possible within a human lifespan. In fact, around half of us are predicted to be diagnosed with cancer given current life expectancies. As a result, cancer is a major killer：it’s responsible for over a quarter of deaths in the rich world, and one in six worldwide.

Thus, cancer is the first reason to be concerned about accumulation of mutations with ageing – anything we can do to decrease their frequency should help us prevent cancers from arising in the first place. However, the process of clonal expansion is problematic in another way – it also provides a new mechanism for troublesome mutations to have an outsized effect on our ageing bodies, even if they only occur in a comparatively tiny number of cells.

We’re just beginning to find out how widespread these clonal expansions are. Recent studies have shown that, in some tissues in old age, there’s hardly a normal cell to be found. But it’s not a mosaic of a million mutations, every cell different; it’s a patchwork of little colonies, usually under a millimetre across, each made up of cells with one or two specific mutations that give them a competitive advantage. This was first uncovered in a 2015 study looking at the skin of four people over the age of 50, which found that 20–30 per cent of cells contained a driver mutation – an average square centimetre of skin played host to 140 different driver mutations. This is a mind-blowing result：all over your skin, right now, are thousands of competing clones vying for dominance. Given this sheer number of clones and the vast burden of mutations, it’s only the action of protective mechanisms like cell death, senescence and the immune system that keep us all from very rapidly succumbing to cancer all over our sun-kissed skin.

However, sun-exposed skin was always thought to be an outlier given its constant bombardment from ultraviolet light. Subsequent work looking at the oesophagus (the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, and accordingly well-shielded from sunlight) found strikingly similar results. Though there were far fewer mutations overall, individual clones were able to expand further. (It’s likely that the decreased ability of clones to expand in the skin is one of the mechanisms which protects us from skin cancer, but we don’t know exactly what confers this protection.) By the time you’re elderly, your oesophagus will be home to around 10,000 different clones covering almost its entire interior.

The easiest way to understand why this might be a problem is to look at an example. Another place where clonal expansions are common is among the HSCs – the stem cells responsible for making blood cells. The most common driver mutation in HSCs is a gene called DNMT3A. The protein it encodes controls whether a stem cell divides asymmetrically (forming one stem cell and one differentiating daughter) or symmetrically (forming two stem cells). An HSC with a DNMT3A mutation will preferentially divide symmetrically, which provides a huge competitive advantage – rather than just producing one stem cell after each division and therefore keeping numbers constant, you get two, then four, then eight, doubling each time and, after just 20 divisions, it will outnumber a puny asymmetrically dividing stem cell by a million to one. It’s no wonder that these cells outcompete those with intact DNMT3A and clonally expand.

The mutants do eventually stop their rampage because other mechanisms kick in telling them that that’s enough dividing for now. However, someone with this mutation can nonetheless end up with a large fraction of their HSCs being mutants, which in turn means that many of their red and white blood cells are manufactured by these mutant clones. The presence of clonally expanded HSCs is associated with the risk of cancers like leukaemia – so far, so obvious, given that cancer is made possible by a succession of clonal expansions – but is also associated with diabetes, and a doubling of the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

The precise mechanisms behind these observations are not yet fully understood, but it’s plausible to expect things to go wrong in your blood if a significant number of your blood cells have a mutation in a key gene. Scientists studying this have observed that people with clones in their HSC pool have less consistently sized red blood cells, which, at a minimum, is a sign that something’s up. We also know that the atherosclerotic plaques behind heart disease and some strokes are mostly composed of white blood cells, specifically macrophages – it would make sense that dysfunctional mutated macrophages could worsen their prognosis. Similar clonal expansions around the body in rapidly renewing tissues from skin to gut linings could well cause subtle problems of their own that accelerate specific diseases or aspects of the ageing process if left unchecked.

Thus, these new studies have breathed new life into the threat of mutations as a factor in ageing, by the same process of evolution and clonal expansion which makes cancer a menace. The key principle, in both cancer and ageing, is that what’s good for the survival of an individual cell isn’t necessarily good for the organism as a whole. Multicellular organisms rely on collaboration between cells, and these selfish runaway replicants don’t perform their functions quite as they should, decreasing the fitness of the mouse, human, or whatever creature they find themselves in.

The reason for that relatively long digression is that this new understanding of the effects of mutations should inform attempts to devise treatments. The first point to note is that it’s not a done deal that these clonal expansions are sufficient to bring about disease and dysfunction, nor that random changes in individual cells that don’t lead to clonal expansions are entirely irrelevant. Step one is to gather more data, and this effort is already underway：huge reductions in the cost of DNA sequencing mean that scientists are rushing to measure more tissues in more people in more detail than ever before. The next ten years will see our knowledge transformed, revealing what mutations occur where in far greater detail, and that will allow us to work out where and how they might cause problems. But if, as seems likely, these clonal expansions are an issue, what can we do?

The first piece of good news provided by this picture of how mutations contribute to ageing is that, though the clones are very widespread, the takeover is usually orchestrated by cells with defects in only a handful of genes. Mutations that inactivate a gene called NOTCH1 are responsible for the majority of the clones in both skin and oesophagus, so a drug which targeted this mutation could significantly reduce the number of aberrant cells we’d need to worry about. Going after the top five or ten mutations would dramatically improve matters, which is far better than the thousands of treatments that the random-mutations-causing-dysfunction theory would have required us to develop. Exactly what those treatments would look like is speculative for now, but there are plenty of options：cancer researchers have spent decades looking for ‘targeted’ therapies which will attack cancer cells with particular mutations while leaving bystander normal body cells alone, meaning that there are many treatments which could be repurposed to go after non-cancerous clonally expanded mutants.

As well as tackling clonal expansions relevant to ageing, this could also be a good preventative medication for cancer. A study examining the mutations present in over 2,500 tumours found that half of the earliest driver mutations occurred in just nine genes, and that they appear years or perhaps even decades before diagnosis. That means, in principle, that a substantial number of cancers could be prevented if we could find ways to kill cells with one of those nine mutations. While again we don’t know exactly how we would do that, finding treatments targeting nine genes is a substantially more tractable problem than if hundreds or thousands of genes bore responsibility for setting a cell on the path to becoming a tumour.

The other way we could overthrow the clones rather than just killing them is to change the environment to favour normal cells. In evolution, ‘survival of the fittest’ specifically means fittest for the current environment. Thus, if drugs or other therapies change that environment such that regular, unmutated cells have a competitive advantage, they would be able to gradually wrest control from the clones. How exactly we’d do this is again up for grabs, but there is preliminary evidence that the tables can be turned on the mutants. A recent proof-of-concept study found that giving mice a dose of X-rays boosted growth of cells in their oesophaguses with p53 mutations (p53, as well as being a favourite mutation in cancer, is also the second most common driver of clonal expansions in the oesophagus), but that zapping them with X-rays after a dose of antioxidants improved the odds of the normal cells competing with them. While therapeutic antioxidants-plus-X-rays might not catch on as a treatment, this work does demonstrate that the supremacy of clonal expansions is contingent on their environment, and that tweaking it can help normal cells regain the upper hand. (It also raises the intriguing prospect that perhaps the reason too much radiation exposure causes cancer isn’t mainly because the radiation directly causes mutations, but that it might encourage mutant clones to grow bigger, increasing the odds of one of them taking the next step towards cancer.)

Perhaps the most radical idea to obviate DNA damage and mutations is a complete refresh of the body’s stem cells – an approach which works whether it’s clones or random mutations in individual cells (or both) that cause problems in ageing. The other piece of good news from sequencing studies is that there are usually still at least a few cells left over whose DNA doesn’t have any significant problems. If we could extract some of those unmutated cells, turn them into induced pluripotent stem cells, double-check their DNA is free from random errors or game-changing driver mutations, and then turn those iPSCs into stem cells for skin, oesophagus, intestine, blood, and other tissues plagued by mutations, we could use these to replace the mutant cells. More knowledge will also inform where in our bodies a DNA refresh is most needed, and it might well be that fixing the most urgent tissues tides us over until we can fix those where mutation rates are lower, or clonal expansions less problematic.

Mutations in our DNA will probably be one of the hardest hallmarks of ageing to overcome. The ideas we’ve discussed range from proofs of concept in the lab to purely speculative for now. But it’s a problem we’re going to have to deal with eventually：mutations will keep accumulating, 10 to 50 per year in every cell in your body, and clones will keep expanding, slowly strangling their normal neighbours, even if we sort out absolutely everything else. The happiest solution to this problem would be to discover through further study that non-cancer-causing mutations aren’t sufficiently harmful to our health to be a significant problem even in extended lifespans, but we should plan for the worst even while we hope for the best.

Thankfully, our understanding of the prevalence and type of mutations in ageing will increase dramatically in the near future. Genome sequencing is now cheaper than ever, and interest in accumulation of mutations is coming not only from the ageing research community, but the cancer research community, too. Those of us interested in curing ageing need to make sure that this work explores the contribution of mutations to degeneration as well as cancer, and ensure that attempts to actually treat it are developed in tandem with exploratory work. If we do that, the first treatments to tame rampant clones or gene therapies to bolster our DNA’s defences could be near enough to matter for many of us alive today.





*Though telomerase is disabled in adult human cells, things get a bit more complicated in other species, ranging from short-lived mice to long-lived, cancer-free naked mole-rats, which have active telomerase in their cells. Different species have found quite different ways to balance on the telomerase tightrope.

*Adeno-associated virus, or AAV, if you’re interested – a common ‘viral vector’ used in genetic modification in the lab, and a leading candidate for delivering human gene therapy.

*The gene responsible for green fluorescent protein, or GFP, was first isolated from a jellyfish in the 1990s. Since then it – and modified versions which glow in other colours, with delightful names like mCherry, T-Sapphire and Neptune – have become indispensable tools in biology. Their distinctive glow under a microscope renders what could otherwise be very complex experiments – like determining which mouse two basically identical-looking cells came from – incredibly simple.

*By way of comparison, an average human has about five litres – several thousand times more, which is basically in proportion to the weight difference between us and mice.

*For example, in mitochondria, the three-letter DNA sequence TGA means ‘add the amino acid tryptophan’, whereas you might remember from Chapter 3 that TGA is the nuclear DNA code for ‘stop reading’. This is a pretty fundamental obstacle, as it would mean a protein would stop being built midway, rendering it functionally useless.

*The comparison to non-sun-exposed skin often makes use of skin from the bum, presumably making frequent nude sunbathers difficult subjects for study.

†The other 99 per cent of our DNA used to be known as ‘junk DNA’, but we now know that’s something of a misnomer – it’s involved in various processes like making sure the right proteins are produced at the right times. However, in most cases its exact DNA sequence is less critical than the protein-coding regions, and the odd mutation is less important.
