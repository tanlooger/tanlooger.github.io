title: Telomere extensions
---



Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter. Since many of our tissues rely on dividing cells to replenish them, their telomeres eventually become ‘critically short’, leading them to cell suicide or senescence. People with shorter telomeres tend to die sooner than those with longer ones. Is there a way to undo the erosion of our DNA’s protective end caps and, in doing so, extend our lives?

The telomere story starts in 1984, when scientists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider were investigating them in a single-celled pond creature called Tetrahymena. These are tiny organisms, covered in so many microscopic hair-like protrusions that they look furry. My favourite fact about them is that there are seven different Tetrahymena sexes, which the critters decide at random during mating – resulting in 21 different permutations of parentage, and children which can then be any one of those seven sexes again. Blackburn noticed that, under certain conditions, Terahymena’s telomeres could grow. This seemed strange：the expectation at the time was that DNA was a constant, unchanging blueprint for an organism, not something which could be added to at will. How and why were these tiny creatures making more of it?

Tetrahymena’s most useful quirk for telomere research is that they have around 20,000 chromosomes per cell, meaning 40,000 telomeres to probe – rather more than the paltry 46 chromosomes and 92 telomeres in a human cell. Thus, Blackburn reasoned, if there was some mechanism which extended telomeres, these hairy lookin’ microbes should be buzzing with it. After years of painstaking research, Greider and Blackburn finally isolated the enzyme responsible for topping up Tetrahymena’s telomeres. They christened it telomerase, and it’s turned out to be rather a big deal：the pair were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009, along with Jack Szostak, who helped Blackburn demonstrate the protective effects of telomeres with experiments in yeast.

Telomerase seemed to be the immortality enzyme, for cells at least. Disabling the gene in Tetrahymena made the little seven-sexed cells, which would normally reproduce indefinitely, die within a week. Most animal cells don’t have active telomerase, and can be used for the converse experiment：adding an extra copy of a telomerase gene allows them to divide indefinitely, sidestepping senescence. This was first done in human cells in the mid-1990s, at a biotech company called Geron – ironically, using cells belonging to Leonard Hayflick. Hayflick made a serendipitous donation of skin cells from his leg：he was showing a TV crew filming a documentary about his work how to take a sample of skin from which to culture cells, and happened to ask Geron’s Chief Scientific Officer Mike West for a scalpel. West thought the opportunity to measure the ‘true Hayflick limit’ – how many times Hayflick’s own cells would divide before turning senescent – was too good to pass up. With fortunate timing, scientists at Geron had recently isolated the human gene for telomerase, so West decided an even better experiment would be to insert an extra copy of the gene into Hayflick’s skin cells and see what happened. Hayflick’s unmodified cells hit their eponymous limit on cue, but those with extra telomerase just kept dividing, making them the first human cells to be ‘immortalised’ with telomerase. The irony is magnified because Hayflick – now in his nineties – is a lifelong sceptic that we will ever be able to intervene in the ageing process.

This miraculous behaviour raises an obvious question：could telomerase do for whole humans what it does for cells in a dish? Judging by articles in the popular press in the 1990s, you’d be forgiven for thinking so. This tale of telomeres as a simple cell division clock, and telomerase as a way to restore them, is so easy to understand that it multiplied like cells with active telomerase. The fact that we’re not all already on telomere-enhancing pills probably tells you that it turned out to be a little more complicated than that.

The most obvious problem is cancer. To form a tumour, a cancer cell needs to divide over and over again, which means it needs to stop its telomeres from getting critically short. As a result, almost 90 per cent of cancers reactivate telomerase in order to sidestep cellular senescence. (The other 10 per cent use a mechanism known as ALT, which stands for ‘alternative lengthening of telomeres’ – an acronym which, like ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’ in astrophysics, exists primarily to cover for the fact that we have very little idea what it is or how it works.) Active telomerase isn’t enough in itself to turn a cell cancerous, but we’d rather not pre-tick any boxes on cancer’s checklist if we can avoid it.

This worry was borne out by the first experiments using telomerase in organisms more complex than Tetrahymena. Scientists added extra copies of the telomerase gene into mice and, while some benefits were observed – including thicker skin and faster-growing hair – so, too, was an increased risk of cancer. Studies doing the opposite, removing the natural telomerase gene from mice, found that a lack of the enzyme suppressed tumour growth. Thus, it seemed pretty clear that telomerase was a pro-cancer enzyme, and this realisation burst the telomerase bubble somewhat.

Thus, telomeres seem to be a key component of our cellular anti-cancer mechanisms. As well as stopping the ends of chromosomes from being glued together, and protecting the important parts of our DNA from being chopped during cell division, as we learned about in Chapter 4, they have also been put to use protecting whole organisms from cancer by the enterprising hand of evolution. By keeping count of how many times a cell has divided, telomeres provide a mechanism to catch cells which have done so too many times. If a cell runs out of telomere and ends up replicatively senescent, it could save your life.

This is why telomerase is disabled in most adult human cells.* However, the enzyme clearly can’t be got rid of entirely, even in non-cancer contexts. For example, it’s imperative that embryos have the ability to regrow telomeres between generations, lest children’s lives be stunted by their parents’ short telomeres and the species go extinct. Pluripotent stem cells, whether embryonic or induced, continually use it to keep their telomeres long, allowing them to divide indefinitely. It’s also active in some adult stem cells, like blood-manufacturing HSCs, but only enough to slow rather than entirely forestall telomere shortening, and sometimes in T cells at times of infection, when they need to rapidly multiply in numbers to face down the specific foe they are tailored to target.

Evolution seems to be playing a deft hand optimising use of telomerase. The dynamics of telomeres, as so often, are a biological trade-off between avoiding ageing and avoiding cancer.

The most extreme example is a rare genetic disease known as dyskeratosis congenita, or DC, which we now know is caused by sufferers having very short telomeres. Patients have problems with fast-dividing tissues, like skin, hair and blood and experience something a bit like accelerated ageing, with rapid hair greying, lung problems and osteoporosis. There’s even a dark irony, in that DC patients are more susceptible to certain kinds of cancer：this is because really short telomeres induce a state called ‘crisis’ and, if a cell fails to go senescent, the chaos in its DNA can induce cancer-causing mutations; and a lack of telomerase weakens our immune system which might otherwise catch it early.

At the opposite extreme, a family was found in Germany with a mutation affecting a single DNA letter 57 bases before the start of the telomerase gene. This increased the amount of telomerase some of their cells produced by around 50 per cent and gave them a dramatically increased risk of cancer. Four of the five family members carrying this mutation had developed melanoma and the other, at 36 years old, was reported to have several worrying moles on their skin. Another developed melanoma at 20, followed by cancer in her ovaries, then kidneys, then bladder, then breast, and finally lung cancer, which killed her at the age of 50. It really is incredible the amount of trouble a single DNA base in three billion can cause.

Thus, telomerase is a Goldilocks enzyme – too little, and your fast-dividing tissues fall apart; too much, and cancer finds it all too easy to take hold. Thankfully, most of us have it pretty close to just right. While there is a bit of natural variation in the population which means that we each have slightly different levels of telomerase, it doesn’t much matter overall. If you look across human populations, you can compare people with subtle DNA variations which slightly increase or decrease telomerase activity：more active telomerase slightly increases the risk of dying from cancer, but doesn’t make much difference to the risk of dying overall because you’re slightly protected from other problems like heart disease which are associated with short telomeres.

So, if telomere length and telomerase levels are rather like walking a tightrope between ageing and cancer, what practical interventions are there which might help us stay on the tightrope rather than falling off in either direction? If you want to follow the story of efforts to turn telomerase into a therapy, you could do worse than follow the career of molecular biologist María Blasco. In 1993, she moved from the lab in Spain where she’d completed her PhD to the US, to work as a post-doc for Carol Greider (whom you’ll remember from her exploits discovering telomerase in Tetrahymena).

Blasco wasn’t deterred when the telomerase bubble seemed to burst in the early 2000s. Convinced that understanding telomeres could lead to new medicines for diseases caused when they get too short, her lab continued experiments on the enzyme. In 2008, her group published a paper showing that telomerase could extend lifespan in mice – as long as they were also genetically modified to be cancer-resistant. Mice engineered to have both extra telomerase and three additional DNA-defending genes, which encourage cells to die or go senescent if they’ve got pre-cancerous mutations, lived 40 per cent longer on average than unmodified mice. This offers a ray of hope – the battle between cancer and ageing seems not to be a zero-sum game, where every victory over one results in death by the other. In a complex biological system, ramping up two competing effects can – and in this case, does – synergise to give a net benefit.

A follow-up experiment tried a different kind of gene therapy in adult mice. The mice were injected with billions of viruses* which, rather than causing an infection, delivered an extra, temporary telomerase gene to their cells. Those injected aged one (roughly equivalent to 40 in human years) lived an average of 20 per cent longer than their peers. The telomerase-treated mice also saw an uptick in their health：better control of blood sugar, higher bone density, plumper skin and improved performance walking a (literal) tightrope. Most importantly of all, there was no obvious increase in risk of cancer.

This is promising and could feasibly be deployed in adult humans – but, as the saying goes, mice aren’t just tiny people. One potential difficulty translating this finding in mice into humans is that mice are considerably shorter-lived – where the average telomerase-treated mouse in this study lived another year and a half post-treatment, a human treated at the equivalent age would have decades of remaining lifespan to accrue cancer-causing mutations. Could this mean telomerase is safe for short-lived mice, but hazardous for long-lived people?

To head off this criticism, Blasco’s lab tried the same viral gene therapy in adult mice genetically modified to have massively increased cancer susceptibility. There was no discernible difference in the cancer rates between mice given extra telomerase and those given a control dose of virus which didn’t contain any DNA – both were equally, and appallingly, high. This suggests that, even in a highly cancer-prone environment, this kind of telomerase gene therapy at least doesn’t worsen matters – and is suggestive that gene therapy in adult humans might not be as carcinogenic as was originally feared.

One final experiment from Blasco’s lab involved making mice which had very long telomeres, but completely normal telomerase. These mice lived 13 per cent longer on average than mice with normal-length telomeres. They also saw a number of health benefits：lower bodyweight, lower cholesterol, less DNA damage and, crucially, less risk of cancer. This experiment suggests that very long telomeres aren’t intrinsically problematic, but it’s hyperactive telomerase that increases cancer risk (as we saw in the German family). Thus, if we could boost telomere length without turning up our existing telomerase genes, perhaps we could sidestep the telomerase trade-off between cancer and degeneration altogether.

With all this fascinating evidence in mice, what’s needed now is more trials to check out telomerase in animals more like us. One option might be to jump straight to humans. As we’ve seen with other hallmarks, there are plenty of cases where telomeres are responsible for diseases more acute than slowly ageing to death. One place to start could be people suffering from dyskeratosis congenita, or a handful of related diseases, whose direct cause is insufficient telomerase.

Another possibility is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the lung disease which you might remember as the first place we tried out senolytic therapy. (It’s reassuring that short telomeres and senescent cells turn up in the same places, given that one can cause the other.) Experiments with telomerase gene therapy in mice suggest that it can reverse IPF and, given that patients don’t currently have any good treatment options, some would probably be willing to take a punt on telomerase. Patients enrolled in these trials will be watched very carefully for any increase in cancer risk and, if this doesn’t materialise, we could start to prescribe them to broader groups of people. Since shorter telomeres put people at risk of cardiovascular disease, heart patients could come next. If people at risk of heart trouble given telomere therapy don’t start to die of cancer, we can imagine telomerase being prescribed prophylactically to all of us.

Gene therapy isn’t the only option. We could also look for drugs or supplements which naturally enhance the activation of the telomerase genes already present in our cells, as long as their action is transitory. The most studied is TA-65, a chemical isolated from a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, which can extend both telomeres and healthspan (but not lifespan) in mice by activating telomerase but without increasing their cancer risk, and there’s some evidence it might have positive effects on health in people, too. It would certainly be worth rifling through drugmakers’ back catalogues to see if there are any other molecules which could be put to use.

So the immortality enzyme of the nineties turned unloved causer of cancer in the noughties is staging a comeback. Experiments in mice present an increasingly watertight case that telomerase, wielded judiciously, need not be a double-edged sword, and there’s no obvious impediment to trying these therapies out in people. And, if they work, we can move from walking the telomerase tightrope with cancer on one side and degenerative diseases on the other, to dancing along it, protected from both.
