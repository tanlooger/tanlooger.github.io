title: Powering up mitochondria
---




The decline of mitochondria, the herd of semi-autonomous energy generators which can be found inside our cells, is responsible for aspects of ageing around the body. There are fewer mitochondria in older cells, and those that remain are less effective at producing energy. The problems are especially acute in places where cells use a lot of energy like the brain, heart and muscles; mitochondria are almost certainly important in Parkinson’s disease, and there’s increasing evidence of their effects in other conditions too. Developing therapies to help out our mitochondria might thus alleviate many of the problems of old age.

As we mentioned in Chapter 4, the first theories about mitochondrial involvement in ageing centred on free radicals. These are a family of voraciously reactive chemicals produced as a by-product of the high-energy reactions mitochondria use to generate power, and a particularly pernicious and mitochondria-relevant group is known as reactive oxygen species, or ROS. Unchecked, these oxygen radicals can go on a rampage around our cells, reacting with anything they see, damaging proteins, fats and even DNA. Luckily for us, they can be mopped up by antioxidants – molecules which can stabilise them without suffering significant damage themselves. Our bodies produce their own antioxidants, in the form of proteins like catalase and superoxide dismutase, and we also find them in our food in the form of vitamins, like vitamin C and vitamin E. Thus, if ROS are the problem, then there seems to be a simple solution：increase levels of antioxidants, either by telling our bodies to make more, or by taking vitamin supplements.

We also touched upon attempts to increase production of antioxidants in mice in Chapter 4：adding extra copies of antioxidant genes for superoxide dismutase and catalase doesn’t seem to extend lifespan. In addition, there’s a huge amount of evidence that antioxidant supplements don’t increase lifespan, in mice or in people. A Cochrane systematic review (considered the gold-standard round-up of medical research results) published in 2012 examined 78 trials with a total of 300,000 participants to assess the effect of antioxidant supplements. The message was clear：these supplements are pointless, and possibly even harmful. Vitamins A and C along with selenium were found to have no effect on longevity; vitamin E and beta-carotene increased the chance of death by 3 and 5 per cent, respectively.

The likely reason for the ineffectiveness of antioxidants is that ROS are used for a variety of functions around the body, as signals to send instructions within or between cells, or in more specialist applications like immune cells using them to destroy bacteria. As a result, mopping up too many free radicals with vitamin pills could cause our bodies to reduce production of our own internal antioxidant enzymes to make sure we’ve got enough ROS for these critical processes – or, at high doses, ROS levels could get too low to fulfil vital functions, actively causing harm. Thus, stopping these rampaging chemical species wholesale isn’t an option.

However, there is one type of antioxidant which is still in contention for extending lifespan – those targeted specifically to mitochondria. Mitochondria, being the site of much of our body’s ROS production, are also one of the main targets of their destructive streak, damaging their outer ‘skin’ known as the mitochondrial membrane, their energy-producing machinery, and DNA (mitochondria, remember, have a short length of their own outside the main DNA storage found in our cell nuclei). This means they are at disproportionate risk from free radicals – and that protecting them from this damage could be disproportionately better for us than indiscriminately soaking up free radicals throughout the cell.

A 2005 paper reported results from mice which had been genetically modified with additional copies of the gene for antioxidant enzyme catalase, but altered so it would make its way to the mitochondria：they lived 20 per cent longer than regular mice, with an average lifespan of 32 months rather than 27. Subsequent work in mice has shown that mitochondrially targeted catalase can reduce the risk of cancer in old mice, slow the progression of age-related heart problems, reduce the production of amyloid-beta and extend the lives of mouse models of Alzheimer’s, and improve muscle function in old mice.

There are also several mitochondrially targeted antioxidant drugs in the works. Probably the most advanced is MitoQ, which has made it as far as human clinical trials：one showed that it might help reduce inflammation of the liver in patients with hepatitis C, another that it improved blood vessel function in healthy people over 60, but a third showed that it didn’t slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease (though this might be because, as we’ve noted before, people showing symptoms of Parkinson’s have already lost a huge fraction of their dopaminergic neurons). Interestingly, this might also be a good place to intervene to improve the function of telomeres：treating cells with MitoQ has been shown to decrease the rate at which they shorten. This implicates mitochondrial ROS damage to the telomeres’ DNA in their shortening, as well as the number of times a cell has divided. Further clinical trials of MitoQ and other drugs like it are underway.

Another option is to ramp up our bodies’ existing capacity for mitochondrial quality control to try to get rid of the ineffective mitochondria and allow better-functioning alternatives to replicate and take their place. Drugs are being identified which can boost ‘mitophagy’, the mitochondria-specific flavour of autophagy which we mentioned previously. One compound is urolithin A, a molecule made by our gut bacteria while digesting nutrients found in our food, which has been shown to extend lifespan in worms, improve endurance and muscle strength in mice and slow cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer’s, as well as improve mitochondrial function in people over 60. Other contenders for mitophagy-boosting include spermidine, one of the DR mimetics we discussed a few chapters ago, and supplements that can increase levels of a molecule called NAD⁺, which is critical to cellular energy generation, important to mitophagy and known to decrease with age.

However, it’s quite possible that adding antioxidants or improving mitophagy are essentially oiling a broken machine – something that will smooth the decline, but ultimately can’t address its root cause. Unfortunately, finding the fundamental reason for mitochondrial decline with age is incredibly challenging. The more we learn about mitochondria, the more weird and wonderful these semi-autonomous symbiotic beasts in our cells seem, and the more complex their interactions grow. If there is a single root cause of mitochondrial decline, the strongest case is probably mutations to their DNA. Mitochondria, remember, are the only part of our cells outside of the nucleus that contain their own DNA, and increasing the number of mutations in it is enough to cause something that looks a bit like accelerated ageing in mice. The question we really care about is the reverse：could reducing the burden of mitochondrial mutations slow down or reverse the ageing process?

The best way to find out, as ever, is to fix it and see what happens. The most radical idea to prevent mitochondrial mutations is ‘allotopic expression’：placing a backup copy of the mitochondrial genes in the cell nucleus with the rest of our DNA. While it may sound like an outlandish re-engineering proposal, it’s actually finishing a job that evolution started, but has never quite got round to completing. Mitochondria have a rather bizarre origin story：they are thought to have first come into being over one billion years ago, when an incredibly distant, single-celled ancestor of ours engulfed an entirely separate organism and began a symbiotic partnership that would last a million millennia. That engulfed mitochondrion-to-be had a full complement of DNA of its own but, in the intervening eons, almost all of its genes have either been lost or migrated to the cell nucleus. One reason this is a good idea is that it’s a safer place to store DNA – where it will be away from all the nasty free radicals the mitochondria produce, be replicated far less often and protected by more efficient nuclear DNA repair mechanisms.

The idea of therapeutically moving mitochondrial genes to the nucleus isn’t entirely new：it was actually first done in the 1980s, when yeast cells missing the mitochondrial ATP8 gene were given a copy in the nucleus which was successfully imported into their mitochondria. Since then, it’s moved on to become a treatment under serious consideration for inherited mitochondrial diseases, where mutations in mitochondrial DNA can cause problems ranging in severity from exhaustion during exercise to sudden death a few days after being born. The furthest through development is a therapy based on this idea for a mitochondrial eye disease called LHON. It’s currently struggling in the final phase of clinical trials, but initial success in cells, mice and rabbits suggests that, even if this particular formulation doesn’t work out in humans, there’s at least something to it.

The idea of moving all the mitochondrial genes to the nucleus to combat mutations in ageing, rather than just one which is causing a specific mitochondrial disease, came from Aubrey de Grey, who we met in Chapter 4 as the father of ‘Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence’, or SENS. Accordingly, it’s his SENS Research Foundation that has got the furthest with this idea so far, successfully restoring function to cells in a dish with mitochondria missing two genes by providing them with a backup in the nucleus and, more recently, getting all 13 mitochondrially encoded genes working to varying degrees in the nucleus by optimising their genetic code.

There’s more work to do to get this working properly, and then to prove that it will actually help if we succeed. Perhaps the biggest outstanding question is：if this is such a great idea, why hasn’t evolution already done it? Of around 1,500 genes needed to make a mitochondrion, over 99 per cent are located in the nucleus in humans. Why did evolution stop there? On one hand, there’s nothing particularly special about the number 15：a single-celled soil-dwelling creature called Andalucia has retained 38 protein-coding genes in its mitochondria, most of which are found in the nucleus in other organisms; Plasmodium, the parasite which causes malaria, has just three; and a parasite that infects oceanic algae was discovered in 2019 that may have no mitochondrial DNA at all (though there are differences in the details of how these organisms use their mitochondria to generate energy). There are also some significant roadblocks to evolution placing every last gene in the nucleus：at some point in our evolutionary history, the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes diverged to have slightly different ‘dialects’, meaning that, nowadays, if some mitochondrial DNA just found itself in the nucleus by accident it would require significant and extremely unlikely levels of modification to make the necessary protein.* If this is why our mitochondria still have DNA, there’s not really any theoretical barrier to moving it, just a large wall of biological improbability stopping it from happening by chance.

However, it might be that mitochondria need to retain this small complement of genes in order to work efficiently：mitochondrial DNA may represent devolved government, using local knowledge to optimise cellular metabolism somewhat independent of the centralised bureaucracy of the nucleus. If this is the case, a backup copy elsewhere could destabilise cells’ delicately delegated metabolic chain of command. The only way to know for sure is to try it：at a minimum, we’ll learn a bit of mitochondrial biology; it’s quite possible we’ll find cures for some mitochondrial diseases along the way; and, at best, we eradicate mitochondrial mutations as a cause of degenerative ageing.

The final option is to take on not the defunct mitochondria, but the cells they take over. When mitochondrial DNA is altered, most of the mutations don’t cause significant problems – but a small percentage of cells come to be dominated by zombie mitochondrial clones which have lost a significant chunk of their DNA, and with it their capacity to generate energy. It’s not entirely clear if cells like this are sufficient in number to cause significant age-related problems, but, as we’ve seen with senescent cells, it’s quite possible for a few bad apples to accelerate ageing. That suggests a similar approach to how we deal with senescent cells：kill them, but with (currently hypothetical) ‘mitolytic’ rather than ‘senolytic’ drugs. The risks of this idea are much the same as the risks of senolytics, in that removing the delinquent cells might cause its own problems. For example, a mitolytic drug targeting a muscle fibre containing defective mitochondria would destroy the whole fibre, leading to muscle wasting – exactly the type of strength-sapping process we’re trying to avert. However, it’s probably worth trying：the worst-case scenario is that we’ll come away with a better understanding of what these cells’ internal zombie apocalypses mean in ageing, and the best is that the trade-offs are worth it, and killing these cells benefits our health.

Overall, we’ve got quite a few options when it comes to trying to slow or reverse the contribution of mitochondria to ageing, but we’re not entirely sure which will work best. This is partly because we still don’t have a complete picture of what happens to our mitochondria as we get older. In the short term, treatments might include mitochondrially targeted antioxidants to mop up the free radicals they produce, or supplements, like urolithin A, to ramp up our bodies’ own quality-control mechanisms. In the long run, it might be possible to re-engineer our biology to make sure that mitochondrial mutations no longer matter, eradicating their contribution to degenerative ageing – a goal well worth expending significant energy to achieve.
