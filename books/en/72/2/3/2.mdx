title: Can young blood teach old cells new tricks?
---




In ageing biology, the prize for the experiment with the richest overtones of Gothic horror must go to heterochronic parabiosis. The technique somehow manages to combine Frankensteinian sewing together of body parts with a vampiric taste for young blood. In such studies, two animals (usually rats or mice) of differing ages have the skin on one side of their body peeled back, and their two exposed flanks are then sewn together. As the healing process gets underway, tiny blood vessels grow between their bodies until the artificially conjoined twins share a blood supply.

While it may sound gruesome, heterochronic parabiosis has given scientists a new way to understand, and potentially devise treatments for, the ageing process. One of the many vital functions of blood is to act as a telecommunications network for the body, ferrying dissolved chemicals which act as messengers that can affect how cells behave throughout the body. Watching what happens when a young mouse is confronted with old blood, or an old mouse is given a refreshing blast of the young stuff, has given us fresh insight into how the effect of systemic, internal factors can drive ageing. It also provides inspiration for new treatments – which thankfully won’t involve sewing old people to teenagers.

Parabiosis was first developed purely as a scientific novelty in the nineteenth century. In 1864, physiologist Paul Bert sewed two rats together and demonstrated that they shared a circulatory system by injecting one with deadly nightshade. Deadly nightshade is also known as belladonna – from the Italian bella donna, meaning ‘beautiful woman’ – because, during the Renaissance, women used eye drops made from its berries to dilate their pupils and make them appear more attractive (its English name should tell you why this was a terrible idea). After injecting it into one rat, its pupils dilated rapidly; within five minutes, the other rat’s pupils enlarged, too, showing that it had made its way into the other rat’s blood, and proving that their circulation was shared.

Parabiosis has since been used to study obesity, cancer and even tooth decay – scientists can change some factors for one animal in the pair, while parabiosis makes sure that their internal environment is mostly shared, allowing the effects of the changes to be teased apart. The tooth decay experiment is a neat example. Researchers in the 1950s wanted to work out whether it was sugar’s direct effects in the mouth or its indirect effects in the blood that caused rotten teeth. They turned to parabiosis, feeding one rat in the parabiotic pair a sugary diet and the other normal food. The shared blood supply meant that both rats had equally sugary blood – but only the one actually eating the sugar developed cavities, proving that blood sugar levels aren’t a factor. It may be a bit grisly, but it’s an elegant way to ensure a fair test.

Parabiosis means, perhaps a little euphemistically, ‘living beside’. For ageing researchers, the interest is in the ‘heterochronic’ version – when you sew together animals of different ages. The first experiments of this type also took place in the fifties, performed by Clive McCay (the dietary restriction pioneer you will remember from Chapter 3). He and his team conjoined 69 pairs of rats in total, in what now seem like rather primitive procedures with varying degrees of success. Eleven pairs died within weeks of ‘parabiotic disease’, thought to be a consequence of both bodies’ immune systems going to war against the foreign tissue in the other (interestingly, we still don’t know exactly what causes this – but it’s far less common in modern experiments, probably due to improvements in sterile surgical techniques). Other pairings met their end when one rat chewed the head off its partner (modern incarnations allow the animals a couple of weeks in the same cage to get used to each other before attaching them, for both practical and ethical reasons). The results were suggestive, with the older animals in heterochronic pairs showing improved bone density, but the experiments weren’t systematic enough to be truly convincing.

Experiments in the early seventies provided a more robust picture. Scientists compared the lifespan of pairs of rats joined heterochronically to both isochronic (same-aged) pairs and animals living a more conventional solo existence. The lone animals lived around two years; rats in isochronic parabiosis lived slightly less long, confirming (perhaps unsurprisingly) that being sewn to another rat is a physically stressful procedure; but the older rat in a heterochronic pairing lived longer – about the same as a solo rat if the pair were male (meaning that being attached to a younger partner was enough to cancel out the disadvantages of the parabiosis itself), and three months longer than normal if the pair were female.

What’s shocking is that, after these early results, parabiosis went the way of so much promising early ageing research and the field lay more or less fallow for the next 30 years. It wasn’t until the early 2000s that it was finally rebooted, by wife-and-husband team Irina and Michael Conboy. The 1970s research had left key questions unanswered：it’s all well and good to show that rats live longer when sewn to a younger partner, but what drives this increased longevity? The Conboys were interested in one aspect in particular：how the decline in stem cell function with age affects the ability of tissues to regenerate. To what extent is this decline driven by the aged environment of an old mouse body as opposed to any intrinsic problems in the cells themselves?

As we get older, it takes us longer to recover from injuries, be they cuts and scrapes or broken bones. As we’ve already discussed, much of this is because the stem cells which would normally replenish these tissues slowly decline in function – fewer or less enthusiastic stem cells produce fewer progenitor cells which can go on to replace those damaged or lost in an injury. The same is true of old mice, so the Conboys chose to see what happened to mouse rates of healing in various parabiotic combinations – young-to-young, old-to-old, and old-to-young.

Looking at three different tissues – muscle, liver and brain – their results were clear-cut. Old mice attached to young mice healed as well as a young mouse attached to another young one. As proof that it was something to do with signals in the blood reactivating the older mouse’s cells, rather than youthful stem cells helpfully carried by the blood on a rescue mission from the younger partner, they genetically engineered some of the young mice in the experiment so that their cells glowed green. On investigating the healing tissues under the microscope, only 0.1 per cent bore the distinctive green glow – pretty much the whole healing effect came from reawakening dormant cells in the older mouse.* Confirmatory experiments took cell samples from old mice in a dish and bathed them in youthful blood plasma – the straw-coloured liquid part of blood, sieved of its cells. The results were much the same：young plasma rejuvenated the old cells, restoring their potential for growth.

These results are genuinely remarkable. Old cells aren’t irreversibly decrepit, damaged beyond all hope of repair – instead, there’s latent capacity, able to be eked out by the rejuvenative power of a youthful partner. The ability of old cells and organs to perk up when provided with an improved environment wasn’t a given – it wouldn’t have been surprising to find that they were intrinsically worn out, unable to flourish even with encouragement. Instead, an old mouse can be rejuvenated by attaching it to a younger one, living longer and healthier by having its own cells reawakened by a more youthful signalling environment.

The message the press took away from this was even more compelling：young blood has regenerative powers. Not only could this be a miracle cure but, as an added bonus, it taps into centuries of vampire folklore：suddenly, drinking the blood of virgins doesn’t seem quite so far-fetched as a strategy for immortality. The study, published in 2005, made headlines around the world.

Unfortunately, this being biology, things aren’t quite that simple. Firstly, for anyone thinking of drinking young blood, you should be aware that enzymes in your stomach will thoroughly break down most of the signalling molecules it carries before they ever make it into your own circulation. This means necking blood from someone’s jugular won’t be of any use. However, it’s not just the traditional vampiric mode of delivery which is flawed. What also didn’t make so many headlines was the significant negative effect on the younger mice in the partnership. This suggests an alternative explanation – rather than young blood being the elixir of life, maybe older blood is deadly, and the service the young mouse is providing is dilution of the problematic signals in older blood, at great cost to its own health. (In fact, it’s probably a bit of both.)

The final caveat is that heterochronic parabiosis is far more than just mixing blood. The older animal has the privilege of the younger one’s youthful organs. The younger rat or mouse has a better liver and kidneys for filtering toxins; better lungs and a stronger heart to make sure more oxygen is delivered to the organs of both mice; a youthful immune system with a fully functional thymus, better at seeking out and destroying bacteria, viruses and pre-cancerous or senescent cells; and so on. There are also far more everyday factors：for example, young mice run around their cages more and, if you’re an old mouse sewn to one, you benefit from an enforced exercise regime. That means the advantages to an old mouse in a parabiotic pair go substantially beyond simply adding pro-growth signalling molecules or diluting bad ones.

These ambiguities didn’t stop a surge of interest from scientists and Silicon Valley biohackers alike, who proceeded with varying degrees of scientific rigour. Continued parabiosis experiments have shown us that the older mouse in a heterochronic pair has improved growth of both brain cells and blood vessels in the brain, better spinal cord regeneration, and can have an aged, oversized heart shrunk back to a more normal size. This extends the catalogue of organs which benefit from parabiosis and might harbour latent healing capacity, but doesn’t bring us much closer to a workable therapy.

Others tried injecting youthful plasma into old mice and humans. There is some scientific rationale to trying this out just to see what happens：plasma transfusions are a relatively safe procedure, and a positive result would provide proof of principle which could then be built upon, rather like the original parabiosis experiments. However, human trials don’t appear to have been a resounding success – one in South Korea hoping to use young plasma to alleviate frailty began in 2015 and has yet to report any results, and a US trial gave transfusions of young plasma to Alzheimer’s patients but didn’t succeed in turning back the disease.

The field has also got something of a bad name thanks to private companies trying to cash in on the euphoria around young blood. One colourful outfit called Ambrosia offers anyone over 35 the opportunity to receive a litre of youthful plasma for $8,000 (at the time of writing, a promotional offer also allows you to get two for $12,000 – buy one, get one half-price). In spite of reputed popularity among Bay Area tech execs and venture capitalists hoping to extend their time on Earth,* the company temporarily ceased treatments after the FDA (which regulates food and drugs in the US) issued a statement warning that transfusions of young blood were risky and unproven. After spending nearly a year reassessing the rules, Ambrosia decided that their service is technically legal and resumed operations. The company also bills its treatments as a pay-to-participate trial, but there is no sign of any results at the time of writing. Worse, there isn’t a control group against which to compare transfusion recipients, making it very difficult to discern any effects the treatment may have – you can’t exactly give half your patients an infusion of saline solution if they’ve paid $8,000 for it, even if it would make for a fair test.

All this is despite a significant nail being hammered into the coffin for young blood theory in 2014, two years before Ambrosia was set up：a study giving mice regular injections of young plasma found that it didn’t make them live any longer. This doesn’t rule out some benefits for particular conditions – young plasma has subsequently been shown to improve liver function in old mice, for instance – but it suggests that the global effects of parabiosis can’t be replicated by simple transfusions.

Meanwhile, the Conboys were working on wholesale blood-swapping between old and young mice, replacing parabiosis by connecting pairs of rodents to a tiny pumping device to exchange their blood. That is a pretty smart feat of mini-engineering in itself：mice have just one or two millilitres of blood,* so a microfluidic pump slurped out 150 microlitres at a time to allow it to be safely swapped between the old and young animals. After a few rounds of this back-and-forth pumping, the two mice have a pretty much 50:50 mixture of youthful and aged blood, and testing could begin.

This experiment is far less invasive than parabiosis and looks only at what’s happening in the blood itself without prolonged sharing of organs. Even with a one-off exchange, the results were substantial and quite different from parabiosis. Young blood retained some of its rejuvenative powers, improving regeneration of muscle cells in the older mouse but, overall, the positive effects on the older mouse were outweighed by the negative effects of old blood on the younger one. Of the three tissues tested, muscle, liver and brain, the brain was the worst affected：not only didn’t young blood rejuvenate brain cell growth in the old mouse, the older blood was clearly inhibiting growth of young brain cells, even though the tests were performed almost a week after blood had been swapped. Once again, the simple story of significant benefits from young blood seems to have been undermined – though there probably are some benefits, they’re smaller than the negative effects of old blood.

Given that mass blood transfusions are both unlikely to work and impractical, how can we turn the results of these studies into therapies? The next step is to try to isolate which of the many facets of parabiosis is responsible for its effects. A few groups of scientists began trying to establish what changes from young blood to old and work out how to reverse it. This work involved cataloguing molecular differences – what goes up, what goes down, what stays the same? – and then performing careful experiments to try to work out what their consequences are. One age-related miscreant identified is a protein called TGF-beta whose levels increase in old mice and old humans and which damps the activity of stem cells. By contrast, oxytocin – a hormone which has a complex role in behaviours from social bonding to sex and childbirth – is a potential beneficial factor in young blood which declines with age. A protein called GDF11 was also singled out as a youth-restoring factor, but subsequent work has thrown that finding into doubt. This kind of work has plenty further to run, because there are dozens of substances in blood whose levels change with age, and their good or bad effects may play out in combination with one another.

If this story is more about needing to modulate bad factors in old blood than needing to add regenerative youthful ones, one option is to adapt a treatment called plasmapheresis, a process similar to dialysis. In both procedures, blood is pumped out of a patient’s body, has harmful substances removed, and is then pumped back in again, refreshed. Dialysis is used in cases of kidney failure to remove excess water and waste products from the blood which would normally be removed by healthy kidneys; plasmapheresis concentrates specifically on the plasma and is usually used to remove the antibodies which cause the immune system to go on a rampage in autoimmune conditions. If we can identify the problem molecules in old blood, we could reconfigure devices like these to remove them. The question here, which can only be answered empirically, is how often this treatment might need to be repeated：opting for plasmapheresis every few months would be a hassle, but perhaps an acceptable one if it substantially improved health; the punishing schedule of four-hour sessions three times a week endured by dialysis patients would be far less palatable.

The most straightforward approach is to try to optimise various signalling factors by altering their levels or effects with drugs. The Conboys tried dialling down the activity of TGF-beta, one of the signalling proteins they’ve identified as increasing with age, by giving mice a drug called an ALK5 inhibitor. (ALK5 is the receptor that cells use to detect and react to TGF-beta, so inhibiting it stops them from doing so.) The drug reawakened stem cells in the brain and muscle, causing new neurons to grow and speeding recovery of muscle after an injury. They also tried simultaneously administering the drug and extra oxytocin, whose concentration is reduced with age. This, too, had beneficial effects on brain, muscle and liver, very similar to those seen in heterochronic parabiosis, after just a week of treatment. The most exciting thing about this second study was that the addition of oxytocin allowed the dose of the ALK5 inhibitor to be reduced tenfold：from a practical standpoint, a lower dose of a drug reduces the risk of side effects in patients; from a theoretical one, this suggests that these signalling pathways interact in ways which means tweaking several at once can have an effect greater than the sum of its parts. ALK5 inhibitors and oxytocin are already approved for clinical use, meaning they’re prime candidates for a first-generation signalling-correcting therapy in people.

Factors dissolved in blood are not the only contributors to the body-wide changes in signalling that accompany ageing. Another key component of the signalling system is ‘exosomes’ – tiny bubble-like packages which transport molecules between cells. The smallest of them are tens of nanometres across – hundreds of times smaller than a typical cell, and similar in scale to viruses. Their cargo varies, but often they carry messages encoded in microRNA – very short lengths of a molecule rather like DNA, which carries information as a series of bases (RNA uses the A, C and G we are familiar with from DNA, but with T replaced by U). When an exosome arrives at a destination cell it gets absorbed, depositing its cargo inside. There, the microRNAs can do their work, providing instructions which alter the recipient cell’s behaviour.

One study looked at stem cells in the hypothalamus – a part of the brain already heavily implicated in signalling to control fundamental processes like hunger, thirst, circadian rhythms and body temperature. The researchers found that hypothalamic stem cells died in droves as mice in the experiment aged. Injecting fresh stem cells from the hypothalami of newborn mice didn’t just rejuvenate this particular region of the brain – it increased lifespan by 10 per cent compared to mice given a different cell type as a control. And, as so often in ageing experiments, the mice weren’t just living longer, but living healthier, performing better in treadmill, muscle endurance and cognitive tests.

This is amazing：adding stem cells to just one place has effects so broad that the mice actually live longer as a result. While incredible, perhaps it’s not surprising given the hypothalamus’s role as a signalling nexus for so many diverse processes – adding stem cells should go on to add new neurons to this critical region, putting regulation of all the fundamental aspects of physiology under hypothalmic control back on track. However, the positive effects of injecting the stem cells manifested after just a few months – not long enough, by the scientists’ estimations, for them to have got very far making new neurons. That meant that some more rapid process was responsible, leading them to suspect that signalling exosomes secreted by the stem cells were rejuvenating the cell population. Collecting exosomes from hypothalamus stem cells in a dish and injecting them alone, they saw many of the same anti-ageing benefits.

If this result holds up, it could be turned into a treatment fairly directly：we could reprogram some cells into iPSCs and differentiate those into neural stem cells, which could be injected directly into the brain, or we could grow them in the lab and harvest the exosomes they produce for infusion. This probably isn’t the only place where these tiny message-bearing capsules are significant in ageing, nor the only place they could be used in therapy – one study showed that providing exosomes from neural stem cells dramatically improved recovery from stroke in pigs, and exosomes generally are under investigation as a way to deliver drugs and other useful molecules to where they’re needed in the body. With exosomes, it seems that good things really do come in small packages.

Though the simple but alluring idea of young blood as a cure-all seems to have had a stake driven through its heart, the idea that ageing is partly a phenomenon of signalling gone off the rails is taking wing. What all these experiments with heterochronic parabiosis, blood exchange, signal-tweaking drugs and exosomes show beyond doubt is that some aspects of ageing and loss of regenerative capacity aren’t just intrinsic to cells, but also reflect responses to signals in the cells’ environment. What happens in ageing is a vicious cycle：as the internal environment in our bodies worsens, cells and tissues affected by these aberrant signals deteriorate and then start to emit signals of their own which accelerate the body’s decline. This is bad news in the spiralling decline of ageing, where bad leads to worse; but it could be good news for us, as positive changes lead to virtuous cycles of rejuvenation in our bodies.

Whether we will be visiting a plasmapheresis clinic every so often for a blood factor detox, taking drugs to rebalance our cellular signals, or being infused with exosomes is yet to be determined – but fixing faltering signals is likely to be an important part of our anti-ageing arsenal.
