title: Modifying the microbiome
---




Given the synergistic relationship between our immune cells and gut flora, another thing an improved immune system might help with is our microbiome, maintaining its balance later into life and reducing chronic inflammation. However, as we saw when introducing the microbiome as the new kid among the hallmarks of ageing, we are only just beginning to understand the many factors that affect the health of our microbes, and how their health affects ours. There are probably situations where the quickest intervention is one which deals with the microbiome directly, allowing beneficial bacteria to help the rest of our body out.

There are various ways to try to restore balance to the microbiome. The simplest is probiotics, which you might be familiar with from the dairy aisle of your local supermarket. Probiotics seek to introduce live microorganisms into your guts when you simply eat or drink a product containing them. Another potential avenue is consuming prebiotics – substances which are undigestible to us, but delicious to good bacteria in our guts. The current candidates are mainly various chains of sugars known as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Like probiotics, they have been shown to alter gut microbial populations in a good way. Pre- and probiotics can be combined, as ‘synbiotics’, effectively giving good bacteria together with a starter pack of nutrients to get them going.

More work is needed to establish which pro-, pre- and synbiotics will be most effective in different scenarios, but progress is rapid. Small studies have demonstrated that various drinks, biscuits and capsules containing cultures of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are able to improve numbers of those beneficial bacteria in the intestines of elderly volunteers and push out problematic ones – and suggest that these treatments can have beneficial effects on the immune system, too. A probiotic cocktail of nine different strains of bacteria known as SLAB51 was able to damp inflammation, reduce beta-amyloid and tau aggregation, reduce levels of advanced glycation end products and slow cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer’s. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics have also been successfully used in small human trials to improve symptoms in Alzheimer’s and control sugar in pre-diabetes.

As our understanding of the microbiome advances, and more is known about how these helpful and harmful bacteria and fungi affect our bodies in fitness, fatness, health and ageing, we will be better able to identify which bacteria and other microorganisms will do the most good when transplanted. But the most exciting current results come from a more ambitious technique：a full microbiome transplant.

The story starts with the turquoise killifish, one of the world’s shortest-lived vertebrates (vertebrates are animals with a backbone, like us) because it ekes out an existence in ‘ephemeral pools’ in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. These seasonal ponds – often little more than puddles – see birth, mating and then death of little populations of killifish, whose eggs must then survive long months baking in the dry mud and waiting for rain to fill the pools and start the cycle of life again. This makes it a good potential model organism for ageing research – not as wildly different from us as a fly or a worm (and, critically in this case, with a rich ecosystem of gut flora far more like ours than a fly’s), but with a convenient few-month lifespan which means experiments can be completed on a user-friendly timescale.

Researchers used the killifish to investigate the effects of a microbiome transfer between young and old fish. Two-month-old fish had their own middle-aged microbiome eradicated with a cocktail of four potent antibiotics, and were then given youthful gut microbes to replace them. Not only did they live longer – their lifespan was more than five months on average, a 25 per cent increase over fellow fish with regular gut flora – but they also darted around the tank more frequently in old age, in a kind of fishy proxy for delayed frailty.

There is also some early work in mice suggesting that younger gut flora can improve health in ageing mice. An experiment on mice with accelerated ageing found that a microbiome transplant from normal mice was able to extend their lifespan by around 10 per cent, and that supplementing them with a single species of bacteria which declines with age in both mice and humans extended their lives by 5 per cent. In Chapter 4 we discussed how putting old and young mice into cages together and allowing them to eat one another’s faeces – thus performing a de facto microbiome transplant – worsened inflammation in young mice given old microbes. The converse was also true, with old mice sharing a cage with younger ones seeing a boost to their immune systems. Slightly confusingly, follow-up experiments showed that actively transferring the microbiome between mice (rather than just letting them eat one another’s faeces) improved immunity whether from young to old, or old to young. Clearly transferring gut flora can have a substantial impact on health – but more work is needed to establish exactly which bugs are beneficial under what circumstances.

Humans can have microbiome transplants, too – they involve extracting faecal material (so, poo), purifying it and then either inserting it via colonoscopy or enema, or asking the patient to swallow a capsule filled with freeze-dried powder. If the idea of an enema of someone else’s faeces fills you with horror, you should know that they’re already used as a treatment for Clostridioides difficile infections (also known, more pronounceably, as C-diff), where the assistance of gut flora from a healthy donor can help to eradicate the intruding bacteria. If the alternative is continuing to struggle with a serious infection, a poo transplant is probably preferable, and it might be worth banishing our squeamishness if the alternative is worsened ageing, too. Microbiome transplants have also been shown to help with obesity, diabetes and Parkinson’s in mice, and human trials are following up on these results.

Since one of the benefits of our microbiome is providing us with beneficial molecules, the final approach to realising its benefits is to identify these bacterial by-products, cut out the middlemicrobes and deliver them directly as medication. A recent investigation of this idea was an audaciously exhaustive experiment in our favourite nematode worms, C. elegans. The worms are usually grown on plates of E. coli bacteria, which serve both as their food and the only organism in their gut microflora, making their intestines’ inhabitants substantially easier to study than the rich ecosystems found in humans or fish. E. coli is a very common lab organism and, as such, it’s possible to order strains off the shelf which are missing any of the 3,983 genes whose absence doesn’t kill the bacteria. Thus, the worm study involved growing 3,983 plates of worms, each eating E. coli which were missing a different gene. Of these mutant bacteria, 29 increased the lifespan of the worms. Of those 29, two of the longevity-promoting genes were found to control production of a polysaccharide called colanic acid. Finally, giving the worms colanic acid directly increased their lifespan by 10 per cent, even when living on normal E. coli.

As well as providing proof of the principle that directly consuming microbial metabolites can increase lifespan, this study is also a showcase for the incredible usefulness of nematodes for massive, systematic searches like this – performing thousands of parallel experiments with different bacterial strains in mice simply wouldn’t be possible. The simplest outcome would be if colanic acid has some direct application in higher organisms like us – but regardless, if this general principle holds up, it will be a race to see whether molecules or microbes are the easiest way to realise the benefits of our gut bacteria in the clinic.

While it’s too early to be sure whether microbiome-modifying medicines will find a place in fighting ageing, it certainly seems plausible. With a better understanding of how these helpful and harmful organisms affect our bodies, we might all be periodically popping tablets of freeze-dried faecal matter to keep our guts in top condition.
