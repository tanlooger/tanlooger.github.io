title: Improving immunity
---




One place where stem cells and other rejuvenative therapies will be of use is the immune system. A good place to start is the thymus – the small organ just behind your breastbone where T cells are trained, and which undergoes a programmed decline starting in childhood. The process of useful thymic tissue turning to useless fat is known as ‘involution’ and it’s a surprisingly malleable process. Of the various ways to stop the thymus from involuting, or even reverse the process, probably the best-studied is sterilisation：both surgical removal of the testes or ovaries and drugs that stop the action of sex hormones increase the volume of the thymus in mice.

Though it might prove difficult to get volunteers for a clinical trial of sterilisation in humans, there are some fascinating studies that use historical evidence to try to work out its effects on longevity. In eighteenth-century Europe, singers called castrati dominated the opera scene. Castrati were boys castrated before puberty to preserve their unbroken voice throughout life. An analysis of their lifespan showed that it didn’t differ from other male singers of the time, but the sample size was small and it’s possible that some castrati hadn’t actually been castrated but were just men whose voices had not broken at puberty. Another study looked at inmates of an institution for the ‘mentally retarded’ in Kansas, at a time when the ‘genetically unfit’ were sterilised due to policies initiated by the eugenics movement. These results were more convincing, finding that castrated inmates lived 71 years compared to 65 for other institutionalised men – and they also seemed to avoid male pattern baldness. However, there was still some doubt because 65 years was somewhat lower than general life expectancy in the US at the time, which could mean the difference was an artefact of institutionalisation – perhaps, for example, inmates passed over for sterilisation were unhealthier, or treated differently from their castrated peers, meaning that this effect wouldn’t carry over into the wider population.

The strongest evidence that castration increases lifespan in humans comes from an analysis of the eunuchs in the Korean Joseon dynasty. The Joseon ruled Korea for five centuries and the eunuchs, or naesi, were a key part of the Imperial court：only they, along with the Yang-Ban, or noble class, were allowed to become government officials, and only members of the royal family, eunuchs and women were permitted to stay inside the palace walls after sunset to preserve the royal bloodline. Around 140 eunuchs formed the Nae-She-Bu, an organisation responsible for guarding the palace, cooking, cleaning, overseeing maintenance and running errands for the king.

The naesi were allowed to marry and adopt children, either girls or castrated boys, meaning, somewhat counter-intuitively, that there is a eunuch family tree. In 2012, researchers used it to analyse eunuch longevity, cross-referencing with other dynastic documentation where possible to validate the data. The results were clear：the 81 eunuchs whose lifespans could be verified lived an average of 70 years, compared to three Yang-Ban families of similar social status whose average lifespans ranged from 51 to 56. Even the kings, who spent their whole lives inside the palace, only averaged 47 years at death – two naesi, In-Bo Hong and Gyeong-Heon Gi, lived under four of them, reaching 100 and 101 respectively and Ki-Won Lee, who died at 109 years old, lived under five. This makes three centenarians out of 81 eunuchs – compared to less than one in 10,000 men making it to 100 in modern Japan, the country currently topping the centenarian table – and 101-year-old Gi was born in 1670, when life expectancies were decades shorter than today.

Unfortunately, the Joseon eunuchs’ genealogical records don’t make any note of thymus size. However, there’s good reason to believe it’s a contributing factor. The Kansas inmates lived longer primarily because of a reduced death rate from infections, suggesting involvement of the immune system. There are also experiments in mice：castrating nine-month-old mice increased the size of their thymus and improved their immune response after a flu infection, and it also dramatically improved their ability to resist cancer – when injected with tumour-inducing cells, 80 per cent of control mice developed cancer, while just 30 per cent of their castrated, thymus-boosted siblings did.

Evidence in mice suggests that the same holds true for females as males, but there are far less data to go on in both mice and humans due to the fact that removing the ovaries is a significantly more difficult and dangerous procedure than removing the testes. What evidence we have does point in the same direction：for example, sterilised female inmates in the Kansas study did live longer, but there were so few of them it’s hard to draw firm conclusions. The effect might also be masked because the female sex hormone oestrogen has a protective effect on cardiovascular health：removing the ovaries might help the thymus, but lead to an increased risk of heart disease, reducing the net benefit on total lifespan.

Though sterilisation is a simple intervention for lab experiments, I can’t see many people queuing up to get it. Luckily, there are several alternative treatments, making use of growth hormones, stem cells or gene therapy. The hormonal approach is the most advanced, having made it as far as a small human trial conducted by a company called Intervene Immune. They gave nine men a combination of human growth hormone (HGH) together with DHEA (another hormone) and metformin (the diabetes drug and potential anti-ageing pill you might remember from the last chapter) to combat the diabetes risk associated with HGH. The results were positive, and quite wide-ranging：their thymuses look less fatty on an MRI scan and they have more T cells fresh from the thymus, as you’d hope – but they also saw improvements in kidney function and, most excitingly, a reduction in their epigenetic age, as measured by the morbidly accurate epigenetic clocks we met a couple of chapters ago. This suggests that rejuvenating the thymus can go on to rejuvenate the body more generally, not just the immune system – and, given the immune system’s wide remit for defence and maintenance around the body, perhaps this shouldn’t come as a surprise.

There is also a more direct way to induce thymic rejuvenation, using a gene called FOXN1. Though it has a number of different functions in places like skin, hair and nail growth, FOXN1 seems to be particularly critical in development of the thymus. Most babies born with DiGeorge syndrome – a genetic condition which counts among its symptoms an underdeveloped or entirely absent thymus – are missing the piece of chromosome 22 which contains the FOXN1 gene. It’s also known to reduce in activity with age in mice and humans, at the same time as the thymus disappears. Finally, and most excitingly, FOXN1 seems to be capable of single-handedly driving thymic regeneration：researchers in Edinburgh, UK, genetically modified mice to have an extra copy of it that could be activated with a drug; giving the drug and activating the gene encouraged the thymus to regrow and produce new T cells, even in old mice. As a result, researchers are looking into gene therapy that could add an extra copy of FOXN1 into the cells of our ailing thymuses, or drugs which could turn our existing copies back on.

The final potential approach will come as no surprise after the first part of this chapter：we could grow new thymuses using stem cells. One pioneering treatment which has been used in a handful of cases of complete DiGeorge syndrome – where a newborn’s thymus is entirely absent – is a thymus transplant. The prognosis for a child with complete DiGeorge is not good：they will normally die before the age of two of infections against which, without T cells, they are unable to mount a substantial fight. A thymus transplant can improve these babies’ terrible odds, and examining their blood after the operation shows that they have far more T cells. Unfortunately, the only source for thymic transplants is other babies with intact thymuses undergoing heart surgery, where the thymus is cut away to gain access to the chest, meaning there is a pretty serious shortage of supply. The obvious solution is stem cells and, while they’re not ready for the clinic yet, ‘thymus organoids’ – small, artificial thymuses grown in the lab – have been shown to work when transplanted into mice without thymuses, and rapid progress is being made in generating thymuses from iPSCs, too.

It’s not obvious which of these approaches will bear fruit first, but the multitude of methods in development means that we should soon be able to stop the thymus from involuting. This will ensure that we can make fresh T cells in old age, the first step to boosting our ability to fight infections and cancer to youthful levels.

As we work towards this goal, there are other parts of the immune system which will probably need similar regeneration. One example is lymph nodes, the ‘glands’ that sometimes swell up uncomfortably during an infection and do so increasingly infrequently in old age. The lymph nodes are where a new threat is matched to the immune cells that are best equipped to fight it, meaning that new T cells need functioning lymph nodes to properly mature, and their age-related decline inhibits our immune defences, too. Studies show that the immune system is only as strong as its weakest link, and a revitalised thymus might not be enough to mount a strong immune response if the lymph nodes aren’t in good shape. Regenerative medicine for our lymphatic system is under development, but it’s at an earlier stage than work on the thymus and could do with some extra attention.

As well as looking at the training grounds of the immune system, we’ll also need to look at their graduates. Cells of the adaptive immune system can be some of the oldest cells in the body – the ‘memory’ T and B cells which stick around after an infection, ready to deploy their knowledge of a familiar foe should it return, can survive for years or even decades. This means that the cells themselves can age. The ways we’ll combat that ageing will probably be similar to the approaches we use throughout the body – removing senescent cells (which we’ve already met), and dealing with DNA damage or extending shortened telomeres (both of which we’ll discuss in the next chapter).

The aspect of ageing that applies to the immune system specifically is the change not in individual cells, but the population, as a result of persistent infections like CMV. As we mentioned in Chapter 4, infection with CMV eventually leads to a bloated population of CMV-specific immune cells which clog up the immune system’s memory. Up to a third of our memory T cells can be specific to CMV by old age – leaving less room for memory T cells to fight other infections (and compounded by the lack of fresh T cells emerging from the thymus).

CMV is a herpesvirus, the family of viruses behind genital herpes, cold sores, chickenpox and glandular fever. What all these diverse diseases have in common is their incredible skills when it comes to evading the immune system. While the initial infection may be obvious (like the itchy rash typical of chickenpox), the viruses go into stealth mode after symptoms subside. Your immune system never quite eradicates them all, and the stragglers can hide out in your body for the rest of your life. At times of immune weakness, perhaps a stressful life event or a severe bout of another disease, they can re-emerge. Probably the most famous herpes reincarnate is shingles – a painful, localised rash caused when chickenpox comes out of hiding. Thanks to the general decline of the immune system with age, older people are at far higher risk of shingles, as well as other latent infectious diseases.

The reason you probably hadn’t heard of CMV until a couple of chapters ago is that it rarely has any symptoms – at worst, you might get some nonspecific feverishness for a few days. Given its low profile, CMV is shockingly common – something like half of us have been infected by the age of 30, rising to over 70 per cent by 65. (And that’s in the rich world – it’s pretty much 100 per cent of adults in poorer countries.) It’s transmitted in the body fluids of those recently infected, meaning that it’s easy to catch from babies’ and toddlers’ saliva or, if you miss out as a kid, during sex as an adult. And most of us over 30 still have it – after infection, the virus goes to ground, biding its time. This ubiquity means that, even though you might consider it an ‘external’ factor, it makes sense to consider CMV as a part of human ageing.

Chronic CMV infection is bad news. One study found that older people with the highest level of CMV antibodies in their blood – a measure of the body’s response to infection, and thus of how active CMV is in their system – were 40 per cent more likely to die over the following decade than those with lower levels of antibody activity. It’s not entirely clear whether this is just a correlation – perhaps CMV can flare up as a result of other underlying health problems – or whether the CMV (and the immune system’s increasingly overenthusiastic response to it) is driving ill health and, ultimately, death.

How can we combat the latent threat of CMV? The first, obvious approach is that we should develop a vaccine. This would help those who haven’t yet been infected and might give the rest of us an immune boost to help keep it under control. This is actually a no-brainer even if you ignore the potentially large contribution CMV makes to ageing：one of the few times a CMV infection can be immediately problematic is if you catch it during pregnancy and, worldwide, CMV is the leading cause of brain damage in children, and it can also cause other disabilities. This alone is a sufficient human and economic case for CMV vaccine research.

Another approach is to transfer some CMV-fighting cells to reinforce the ailing troops in older people, in the hope of getting the virus under control without the need for quite such an enormous population of CMV-specific T cells. This treatment has been shown to work using T cells from donors given to people undergoing an HSC transplant, and there’s also been progress towards generating T cells which can target CMV and other infections from stem cells, which would be an ideal source for topping up elderly immune systems.

The final thing we could try is removing some of the CMV-obsessed T cells to free up some space in our immune memory. This leads us to the boldest suggestion I’ve seen to treat immune ageing：a total immune reboot. This could potentially solve the problem of CMV, along with many other immune-related problems of ageing. It would mean giving HSC transplants not just to people with blood cancer, but to those whose only medical problem is biological age. The reason this suggestion is bold is that HSC transplants involve wiping out the existing HSCs and immune cells, which currently means a course of chemo- or radiotherapy, something an otherwise healthy 60-something seems unlikely to sign up for. Bear with me here – it’s not as mad it sounds.

We have already discussed the classic use-case for an HSC transplant：leukaemia. The blood-forming and immune cells are both killed by the cancer treatment, and an HSC transplant is then used to rebuild the blood cells and immune system from scratch. However, in recent years there’s been a growing interest in using HSC transplants to treat a far wider range of diseases.

One example is multiple sclerosis (MS), where the immune system starts to destroy the myelin sheaths which protect nerve fibres, disrupting their ability to communicate. Because nerves control so many different functions around the body, symptoms can be incredibly diverse, from sight loss, to pain, to loss of motor control. MS is just one of many ‘autoimmune’ diseases, where immune cells aberrantly learn to target the body’s own cells or proteins as a threat. While there are genetic factors which can predispose you to it, it seems that MS is somewhat dependent on bad luck. For example, if one identical twin develops MS, there’s ‘only’ a 30 per cent chance the other will, in spite of their identical genetics – which still isn’t great odds, but it shows that there’s a significant non-genetic component. Thus, if you eradicate the problematic immune cells and let the immune system have another shot at developing from scratch, you effectively give an MS sufferer another roll of the dice. For many patients, rebooting the immune system is enough to cure the disease：HSC transplants have a higher success rate than any other available treatment.

Immune reboots have been explored in severe cases of some other autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and lupus, with thousands of patients having undergone the procedure, and there is robust evidence that it works. There are also two recorded instances of HSC transplant seemingly curing patients of HIV, which infects the immune cells. Both had blood cancer and, when they needed a bone marrow transplant, took the opportunity to choose a donor with a mutation which makes their immune cells HIV-resistant. It worked：so far at least, neither patient has detectable levels of the virus in their blood, nor have they needed to take HIV drugs since their transplant.

In ageing, everyone’s immune system eventually goes wrong in multiple different ways. It’s an extremely complicated process involving a rise in autoimmunity, a vicious cycle with chronic inflammation, the expansion of anti-CMV memory cells, and more. Rather than working out exactly how things got in this state, maybe it’s better just to reboot the immune system and start again. In the absence of a complete understanding of how the delicate interactions between multiple populations of immune cells become imbalanced over a lifetime, could we sidestep things effectively by turning the immune system off and on again?

There is some evidence in mice that this procedure could be useful as a treatment for ageing. Scientists in Texas transplanted HSCs from young mice to old ones (though without removing their old HSCs and immune cells first), and added three months to their average lifespan. Another group in Los Angeles destroyed the immune system and HSCs of old mice with radiation, then reseeded with cells from either young or old mice. The elderly mice with a new batch of young HSCs showed improved cognitive performance on a range of different tests – in many cases, comparable to young mice. Mice with HSCs from similarly old mice showed no such improvement, continuing on a similar trajectory of cognitive decline as old mice which hadn’t received any treatment. This suggests that a refreshed immune system may have benefits in many different places around the body.

These experiments didn’t test anything specifically relating to immune function, like response to a vaccine or resistance to infection. Nonetheless, the immune system may well be behind some of the rejuvenation of these older rodents, helping with clearance of senescent cells and so on. Other contributions could come from better, healthier blood cells generally and, as we’ll see in the next chapter, from beneficial signals secreted by the young stem cells. This should be enough to encourage further research into giving older humans fresh HSCs.

For now, HSC transplants are an incredibly serious procedure only considered in cases where there are few other options. This is because the ‘conditioning’ chemo- or radiotherapy that comes first can be punishing, and spending weeks without an immune system while waiting for it to rebuild from scratch puts patients at serious risk of infection (not least from a re-emergence of latent viruses like CMV). However, I think it also provides a fascinating thought experiment when transposed into the context of ageing. As clinical understanding of HSC transplants has improved, mortality in MS patients undergoing this procedure has dropped to 0.3 per cent. That’s not that low – doctors and patients would be understandably hesitant about undergoing a procedure with serious side effects and a 1-in-300 chance of death for anything other than a pretty substantial benefit. However, putting this risk in the context of ageing could change your outlook：in the rich world, your annual chance of death exceeds 0.3 per cent around the age of 50. So, beyond that age, might a 0.3 per cent chance of death from a procedure be worth it if it reduced your chance of death overall by more than that? We don’t have the evidence for giving HSC transplants for otherwise healthy 50-somethings, of course – this is just an example to show how thinking about things from the perspective of ageing could redefine what we mean by a ‘risky’ procedure. And, in the long run, we won’t need to bludgeon the immune system to death with broad-brush, side-effect-laden treatments like chemotherapy anyway：given its benefits to people with autoimmune diseases, work is ongoing to make HSC transplants safer.

It’s not hard to imagine that a rejuvenated thymus, improved lymph node performance and a fresh batch of HSCs could significantly improve immune function in the elderly. There are results in mice, companies and ongoing clinical trials, all of which point in the right direction. The upshot is likely to be worth it, not just in terms of fighting infections, but also to reinforce the immune system’s many other roles around the body, including removing senescent cells and catching early-stage cancer before it becomes a problem.
