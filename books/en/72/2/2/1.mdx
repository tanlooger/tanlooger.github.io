title: Stem cell therapy
---



Stem cell therapy is one of the hottest areas in medicine, and harnessing stem cells for treatments is very likely to be a key weapon in our arsenal against ageing. Stem cells will help to replenish cells that are lost during the ageing process, playing a role in diseases from age-related blindness to diabetes and Parkinson’s.

However, given the hype which often surrounds it, stem cell therapy is frequently misunderstood. The term ‘stem cell’ is thrown around by charlatans who will take desperate patients to shiny, semi-regulated clinics and infuse them with mysterious solutions to ‘cure’ all kinds of different ailments. ‘Stem cells’ aren’t a single thing, nor are they some kind of elixir where a single treatment will fix many different diseases or undo the ravages of time systemically. In order to understand the huge, genuine potential of these therapies, we need to understand exactly what stem cells are, and therefore what we can expect them to do. Getting the right cells to the right place at the right time is key to using them for regenerative medicine.

The definition of a stem cell is a cell which has a choice when it divides：it can either do what most cells do when they divide, and form two of the same kind of cell (which in this case would be two stem cells, used for replenishing the stem cell population), it can divide into a stem cell and another kind of cell (thus not depleting the stem cell population, and adding a fresh, new cell to wherever it finds itself, from the skin to the lining of the intestines), or it can turn into two non-stem cells (to maximise tissue replenishment at the expense of the stem cell population). The process of turning from a stem cell to a specific type of body cell is known as ‘differentiation’. It’s easiest to think about these abilities in the context of a developing embryo.

We all start out as a single fertilised egg, which is the grand matriarch atop a sprawling family tree of different cell types. She is the ultimate generalist, able to form every cell in a developing baby. Her first few daughter cells in the very early embryo are known as ‘pluripotent’ because of their ability to form any tissue of an adult human.* Pluripotency is fleeting：it’s not long before all the cells in the developing embryo are merely ‘multipotent’, still retaining pretty eclectic career options but no longer able to become literally anything. As development continues, so cells’ potential fates narrow as their position in the body becomes clearer. A cell might start out as pluripotent stem cell, and some of its daughters would go on to be general-purpose brain precursor cells, and some of their daughters highly specific kinds of neuron with a particular role in the brain.

Eventually, most cells make it to the end of the road – they are said to have ‘terminally differentiated’. This means if you’re, say, a particular type of cell in the heart or liver, that’s your job for life. If you divide, your daughters will be two of the same kind of cell you already are. The handful of cells which hang back from terminal differentiation are ‘adult stem cells’, like the populations of cells which maintain our skin, the lining of our intestines, or the haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which produce hundreds of billions of fresh blood cells on a daily basis.

This brings us to the first category of stem cell therapy：the transplantation of adult stem cells from one individual to another, or from the same individual to themselves. Though stem cell therapies are often thought of as quite futuristic, there is one workaday stem cell treatment which we’ve been doing successfully for half a century. Bone marrow transplants, which are more properly known as HSC transplants because the HSCs are often sourced not from bone marrow but other locations such as a donor’s blood or an umbilical cord, are now a routine (if serious) medical procedure.

The classic scenario is treating a blood cancer like leukaemia. In leukaemia, the body massively overproduces particular kinds of blood cells, which fill up the bone marrow and overwhelm the stem cells there. This means that they lose the ability to produce blood cells, and patients most commonly die of infections due to a lack of the immune white blood cells which fight them. Like most cancers, the standard treatment is chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which preferentially kill the fast-dividing cancer cells, hopefully not doing too much damage to other fast-dividing cells in the process. However, HSCs are incredibly sensitive to these treatments, too, and they can be depleted so badly that you’d end up dying anyway, just of a catastrophic loss of blood cells instead of cancer. The solution is to wait until the therapy is finished, then inject some HSCs to resume production of blood cells.

There have now been well over one million HSC transplants globally and tens of thousands more are performed every year – they are an incredibly successful procedure which has saved huge numbers of lives. However, using adult stem cells has limitations, especially when it comes to treating ageing. One key problem is that you can only do it where a suitable population of stem cells exists – there don’t seem to be heart stem cells, or stem cells for most parts of the brain, for example, though scientists continue to search. Even if there were useful brain or heart stem cells, most of us would be understandably hesitant to sign up as donors：in the vast majority of cases, HSC donation from bone marrow requires taking drugs for a few days, followed by a few hours having your blood filtered to extract the stem cells, which isn’t too onerous; extracting heart or brain cells, by contrast, could be quite a risky and invasive procedure for the donor.

The second problem is immune rejection. Just like in an organ transplant, the recipient patient’s immune system may identify the new cells as ‘non-self’ and destroy them, removing the benefit of the treatment and mobilising an immune overreaction which can, in the worst cases, lead to death.* Just over half of HSC transplants use the patient’s own cells, which avoids this problem, and we’ve got pretty good at matching donor to recipient for HSCs – but even a decent match still means that, like people who receive organ transplants, many recipients face a lifetime of immune-suppressing drugs, which can have serious side effects and put them at risk of infection.

The breakthrough which could solve these problems arrived in 2006, when Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka managed, for the first time, to turn back the developmental clock in adult cells and revert them to a pluripotent state – meaning they had the potential to become any kind of cell in the body. The ultimate medical hope here is that we could produce unlimited quantities of cells of any type from a patient’s own cells, without the need for potentially invasive donation procedures, or even for relevant stem cells to exist at all. And, since we could generate these cells from the patient, there would be no risk of immune rejection either.

It was thought for a long time that the process of development and differentiation was entirely unidirectional, from fertilised egg, via pluripotent and multipotent stem cells, to adult cells in the body. Perhaps with hindsight it should have been obvious that it isn’t：after all, the miracle of pregnancy requires two adult cells – an egg and a sperm – to merge and, in doing so, turn the clock back from being hyper-specialised reproductive cells to being a fertilised egg once again, with a reawakened ability to become any cell in the human body. Dedifferentiation, then, wasn’t against the laws of biology; the question was then, could the process be reproduced in the lab?

In a series of pioneering experiments in the 1960s, British scientist John Gurdon showed that we can. He took the nucleus – the part of a cell containing the DNA code – from a frog cell, placed it into a frog egg cell whose own nucleus had been destroyed, and watched what happened. Nuclei from young embryos transferred into an egg cell could become adult frogs, while nuclei from adult frogs didn’t make it as far, often failing entirely but sometimes making it as far as a late embryo with distinguishable body parts.

This technique of transferring an adult cell nucleus into a vacant egg cell has been refined over the years and made more reliable. In 1997, it was responsible for the conception of probably the world’s most famous sheep：Dolly, the first ever mammal to be cloned. The transferred nucleus meant that she shared exactly the same DNA as her ‘mother’ whose body it had been taken from.

Clearly a fertilised egg contains some kind of machinery which can ‘reset’ the changes which cause cells to differentiate. By the 2000s, Yamanaka’s lab was studying the genes at work in embryonic stem cells, or ESCs – cells extracted from embryos sufficiently early in development that they’re still pluripotent – to find a way to emulate whatever heady chemistry in an egg cell allows it to turn back the clock. He and his lab eventually succeeded, identifying four genes, known as the ‘Yamanaka factors’, that, when transferred into a cell, could induce pluripotency. This feat – the creation of ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’, or iPSCs – won Yamanaka a Nobel Prize, shared with Gurdon, in 2012.

The reason that the ability to turn back the differentiation clock is worthy of a Nobel Prize isn’t just for the pluripotent cells themselves, it’s for what they can be used to make – which seems to be literally any kind of cell. As proof, scientists have tried swapping out the embryonic cells in a very young mouse embryo for iPSCs – and the result, eventually, is adult mice with every cell type working as they should. This shows that, given the right environment (in this case, inside a mouse embryo), these cells can be coaxed into becoming any cell type in an adult mouse.

However, this is perhaps another cheat – putting iPSCs into nature’s own ready-made cauldron and creating an adult mouse is one thing, but what we really need to do is to produce cells of a given type on demand. So, having dedifferentiated a cell to become an iPSC, the challenge is then reversed – how do we redifferentiate it again into the cells we want? The answers are found by looking back at how embryos develop：if we can understand how the cells in a growing mouse or human ‘know’ what to become, we can simulate those conditions in a dish in the lab, and produce whatever type of cell a given patient needs.

The way a cell in a developing embryo knows what it should become is thanks to a constant stream of chemical messages coming from cells, near and far. Developing cells secrete many different molecules, and the strength, timing and duration of these chemical signals is itself determined by the signals they receive. This recursive, decentralised system gives rise to patterns upon patterns of different chemical messages, allowing each cell to work out where it is by the chemicals in its local environment, and therefore what it should grow up to do.

So, if you want to encourage an iPSC to turn into a neuron, a heart cell, a skin cell, or whatever, you need to supply it with the appropriate series of signals – the same succession it would receive if it were developing for real in a complete embryo, rather than sitting in a dish in a lab somewhere. Over days or weeks, scientists drip the relevant signalling molecules onto the cells in question, slowly guiding them to their required fate. Our improving understanding of both embryology and cell culture means that scientists are getting increasingly good at making the cells they want in the lab.

Hopefully it’s obvious why this would be great news for cell therapies, and not just against ageing：anywhere cells are lost, due to disease, injury or the ageing process, we could manufacture new ones to take their place. And, in the ideal case, cells could be derived from the patient themselves, meaning that there will be no struggles to identify a matching donor – the immune system will happily recognise them as ‘self’ and not flare up in an attempt to rid the body of the invaders.

While it might sound like pluripotent cells are somehow the ‘best’ stem cells, given their ability to form any kind of cell, it’s worth emphasising that stem cell therapies won’t be injecting the iPSCs themselves. This is because iPSCs are no real use in the body because, in the absence of guiding signals, they won’t turn into the type of cells needed – and, not only that, but they can pose a risk of cancer. Pluripotent cells can reproduce indefinitely in a dish in the lab, which is great if you want to make a huge batch of them for an experiment, or to replace lost cells in the body. The flip side of this is, if any pluripotent cells remain in the mixture you inject into the patient, they have the potential to divide indefinitely there too, forming a tumour.

The particular type of tumour caused by pluripotent cells is known as a teratoma, and they’re absolutely grotesque. In fact, they’re so horrible that I highly recommend seeking one out in person to truly fathom their monstrousness (even the name ‘teratoma’ derives from the Greek for ‘monstrous tumour’). Teratomas can occur naturally, though mercifully rarely, usually in women’s ovaries or the testes in men. Without those carefully choreographed signals used in development, the pluripotent cells don’t really know what to do – instead, they differentiate almost at random, forming a chaotic lump of horror. This combination of rarity and ickiness made them collectors’ items for Victorian medics – you can find them in anatomical museums, floating in formaldehyde, disgusting balls of muscle, matted hair, teeth, bone, fat, and sometimes even eyes and bits of brain. One particularly unpleasant example, extracted from the ovary of a patient in Japan in the early 2000s, looked like a tiny, misfolded baby, complete with hair, proto-limbs, a few teeth and a single malformed attempt at an eye. It’s therefore critically important that any pluripotent hangers-on are removed before delivering your stem cell therapy to a patient.

There are many different ideas for therapies using differentiated daughters of iPSCs for therapy, and many of the therapies leading the way are for diseases of ageing. The ideal test case for a cell therapy is one where a disease or dysfunction can be attributed to loss of a single type of cell, meaning that you only need to replenish that cell type, and not a complex population. As a result, two of the fastest-moving therapies are to replace RPE cells, which we met in the previous chapter, to alleviate age-related macular degeneration or AMD, and the specific type of neuron whose loss causes Parkinson’s disease.

The stem cell treatments which are closest to realisation are probably those for AMD. Two trials in 2018 used stem cells to make RPE cells and implant them into patients’ eyes. Both were ‘Phase I’ trials designed to check that a treatment is safe rather than prove whether or not it works – but not only did they demonstrate safety, both also showed improvements in participants’ vision. One patient went from reading at an infuriating 1.7 words per minute to a passable 50 after the treatment, and was able to read 29 more letters on one of those visual acuity test charts where the letters gradually decrease in size. These studies involved a combined total of just six patients, so much more work is needed, but these are exciting preliminary results.

The most significant shortcoming with these trials is that they used embryonic stem cells to make the RPE cells, and so by definition they can’t have come from the patients being treated. The patients therefore needed to take immunosuppressive drugs to stop their immune systems from attacking the new cells. The next step is to replicate these positive results with patient-derived iPSCs. The first test in humans took place in 2014 in Japan but the trial was stopped for safety reasons after the discovery of potentially cancerous mutations in the implanted cells. Though the patient didn’t experience any problems, it caused scientists to slow down and take stock. A 2019 study by the US National Eye Institute sought to allay any fears, using a painstakingly realistic manufacturing protocol for RPE cells, carefully checked at every stage for safety. The protocol passed this meticulous testing, and the next step is to try it in human patients.

The success of ESC-based treatments plus the positive steps towards use of iPSCs mean that hopes are high for patients’ own cells being used to treat age-related vision loss in a hospital near you in the not too distant future, representing the first clinical triumph to stem from Yamanaka’s 2006 discovery.

Parkinson’s is caused by the loss of ‘dopaminergic’ neurons – specialist neurons that produce a chemical called dopamine that brain cells use to communicate with one another. By the time symptoms appear, patients have lost up to 80 per cent of these neurons, massively undermining the precise systems in our brain which allow us fine-grained control of our movements. The standard treatment for advanced Parkinson’s patients is ʟ-dopa, a chemical which the brain can turn into dopamine, but the appeal of stem cell treatments is hopefully obvious：they could replace the dopaminergic neurons and potentially cure the disease, rather than masking its symptoms.

Stem cell treatments for Parkinson’s disease have a surprisingly long history. The first pioneering operations took place over three decades ago, in Lund, Sweden, in 1987. They involved surgically grafting dopaminergic neuron precursors taken from aborted foetuses into the brains of two patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. The idea was that these immature cells would multiply and develop into dopaminergic neurons – and it seemed to work. Buoyed by this early success, the experimental operations carried on for many years. The results were incredibly compelling：one subject, known as Patient 4, received his graft in 1989 and improved so dramatically over three years that he no longer needed to take ʟ-dopa. He enjoyed near-complete remission for nine years, when deteriorating motor function meant that his medication needed to be gradually started again. When he died, 24 years after the operation, a post-mortem revealed that the transplanted neurons were still alive, and had made connections to the surrounding brain cells – though any functional benefit was lost by this point, probably as dementia and general deterioration took hold in the rest of his brain.

After these promising early results, the story took a number of twists and turns：the Swedish studies involved only 18 patients in total and larger, more thorough trials conducted by the National Institutes of Health in the US seemed to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the treatments; the Swedes hit back, saying that the bigger projects hadn’t used fresh cells in their transplants, failed to use immunosuppressant drugs to stop the graft being rejected and didn’t watch their patients for long enough to observe an effect (Patient 4’s improvements, remember, had taken three years to become apparent). There’s little enough data that debate continues to rage, but the clearest sign that the neurology community retained its excitement and optimism is that, in 2010, a collaborative effort to do the definitive study on foetal stem cells for Parkinson’s began. Involving more than 100 patients across Europe, the first results from the TRANSEURO study are expected in 2021.

Unfortunately, since they can only be extracted from aborted foetuses at a specific stage in development (the painstaking procedure involves finding a region the size of a pinhead in a foetus just a couple of centimetres long), the supply of foetal dopaminergic neuron precursors would severely limit the availability of this treatment. As a result, if further work shows that these cells can help with Parkinson’s, the obvious next step is to use iPSCs to make them instead. The first trial with iPSCs – albeit not from the patients themselves, but other donors – began in Japan in 2018, and more are expected soon.

Though AMD and Parkinson’s treatments are leading the pack, there are plenty of other stem cell therapies close behind them. Diabetes might be next：we can make beta cells – the insulin-producing cells found in the pancreas that keep blood sugar under control – from iPSCs in the lab, and they can cure mice with diabetes. Human iPSCs have also been used to make ‘chondrocytes’ which make and repair the cartilage found in joints, and they have been successfully used to regenerate the knees of rats with osteoarthritis. Earlier stage research in mice has shown that placing tiny droplets containing the precursors to smell-sensing neurons can restore sense of smell in mice whose own olfactory neurons have been damaged. Another study took cells purified from human urine (!), turned them into iPSCs, and used them to make dental precursor cells which grew into ‘tooth-like structures’ in mice. Fresh biological teeth for all (as opposed to the various metallic, plastic and ceramic prosthetics available currently) is surely a noble goal for dentistry and will be of particular help for elderly people struggling to chew their food.

Stem cell research is a field so vast and fast-moving that it’s impossible to do it justice in a single section of one chapter of a book. By the time you read this, some details are pretty much certain to be out of date, hopefully because some of these therapies are a little closer to the clinic. It’s perhaps the only aspect of ageing research which gets attention and funding even barely proportional to its potential benefits. Though there are kinks to be ironed out, the pace and breadth of change is breathtaking.

Hopefully you can now see why stem cells aren’t the cure-all suggested by shady clinics – they aren’t a generic one-shot treatment which can reverse ageing on their own, but an umbrella term for a range of treatments involving different kinds of cells. Nonetheless, stem cells are soon going to be a much bigger feature of medical care, especially for the degenerative diseases of ageing.
