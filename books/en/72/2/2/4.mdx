title: Keeping protein pristine

Collagen is a structural protein whose name you may recognise from (often questionable) claims on the labels of skin and face creams. As with many not-quite-scientific claims, there is a grain of truth here：collagen is the most important protein in the structure of skin, and indeed many other tissues in the body, from blood vessels to bones. It’s our most abundant protein, contributing two or three kilos to the average adult’s bodyweight, and lasts for a surprisingly long time：current estimates suggest that it takes years for the collagen in your skin to be ‘turned over’ (the biological term for being broken down and replaced), and collagen in cartilage, which provides the smooth padding between bones at our joints, may last a lifetime.

A single molecule of collagen looks like a really tiny piece of string, made up of three strands of atoms twisted around one another. The collagen molecules are then held together by crosslinks which clip on to specific points on a collagen molecule and attach it to its neighbours. This is a fibril which, if the individual collagen molecules are string, is a thick, long section of rope. These fibrils then bind together, along with various other molecules, to form even thicker structures called fibres – like the thick, many-stranded cables which hold up a suspension bridge. The exact structure of individual collagen molecules is absolutely critical to the multi-thousand-molecule megastructure of a collagen fibre. It dictates how the molecules coalesce into fibrils, and how the fibrils assemble into fibres, and what other molecules are drawn in to act as support, glue or lubricant. The result, in turn, controls a fibre’s properties – not too stiff, not too flexible, but just right in a huge range of biological contexts. The same basic molecular building blocks can make different types of collagen ranging from stretchy in skin and blood vessels to tougher in tendons and strong and load-bearing in bones. This is an oft-neglected biological miracle：we rarely step back to admire the exquisite evolutionary engineering which allows proteins to self-assemble into massive, incredibly effective teams.

Unfortunately, this intricate structure can be disturbed by chemical modifications which change the structure of the individual collagen molecules that make it up. Highly reactive chemicals like sugars and oxygen can stick to the collagen, causing widespread disruption. Dangling sugars can crowbar open fibrils, allowing water to rush in and unbalance their carefully calibrated interior chemistry. Many of these sugary modifications are somewhat transient, and can just fall back off, but occasionally these modifications can themselves be modified. This can eventually result in an advanced glycation end product, or AGE, which is permanent. AGEs can dangle from a single collagen molecule, just like their sugary precursors, or they can crosslink collagen molecules, handcuffing two proteins together and stopping them moving smoothly past one another.

All of these changes can also disrupt the purpose-built crosslinks whose type and frequency dictate the collagen’s mechanical properties. The large-scale effect of these microscopic modifications is to shift collagen away from the sweet spot between stiffness and stretchiness. Though the effect varies by tissue, the most common is a reduction in elasticity, which you can easily see for yourself：a pinched patch of skin springs back into position ever more slowly with the advancing years.

As well as their direct effects on the collagen itself, these chemical changes can set up feedback loops that make matters worse. Collagen provides the scaffolding for many cells to sit on, from skin to bone. In turn, the cells are responsible for the collagen’s upkeep, producing new collagen to renew the scaffolding on which they sit, like responsible citizens keeping their neighbourhood in good repair. The cells bind to collagen in precisely defined sites, whose positions and properties are another feature specified by collagen’s molecular structure. As this structure is disrupted, these binding sites can be obscured or reduced in stickiness, meaning that cells are attached less firmly in place. This is bad in itself, reducing the integrity of the tissue, but perhaps worse is how the cell reacts. As its attachment to collagen becomes weaker, it starts to ponder its identity. When cells are deciding how to behave, some of the cues which guide them come from the ‘extracellular matrix’, or ECM, they’re stuck to. Where firm contact with collagen reaffirms a cell’s purpose as a skin cell or a cell in an artery wall, the loss of that contact introduces some doubt. Counter-intuitively, this means that it produces less new collagen：rather than worrying about the lack of ECM and producing more to compensate as you might expect, the cell becomes convinced by its absence that it’s not one of those cells which sits on a collagen scaffold, and so it has no need to produce any.

It’s also known that cells can detect AGEs, using receptors on their surface which are known by the acronym RAGE – for ‘receptor for advanced glycation end products’. (Protein modification definitely has the best acronyms in biogerontology.) Activation of these receptors promotes inflammation and cellular senescence, and it’s not entirely clear why; one idea is that the cells are calling the immune system for help to clear up AGE-damaged collagen, but there isn’t much evidence to guide us one way or the other. Nonetheless, this means that these damaged proteins can cause cells to contribute to chronic inflammation which, as we’ve seen, is behind many of the processes in ageing.

All of this means that, as collagen undergoes chemical damage throughout our lives, the structural integrity of the ECM begins to fail. Exactly how much blame to assign to the different contributors – glycation, oxidation, AGEs and cells’ responses to all of the above – remains unclear, but the consequences are well understood：stiffer and weaker skin, arteries, lungs, tendons and so on, causing a reduction in tissue integrity all around the body.

What to do about these modified proteins presents something of a challenge. The prevailing theory has long been that the major problem is AGEs, and specifically the crosslinks they form between collagen molecules shackling them together and reducing flexibility. However, work from just the last few years is calling this received wisdom into question – it seems that AGEs, sadly for their catchy acronym, may only be part of the story. Other modifications which mostly don’t crosslink the collagen might be more important than AGEs. Other types of glycation are more abundant, and their power to disrupt natural crosslinks probably has a larger effect than a few extra AGE-related ones. The overall picture is one of chemistry falling out of balance：collagen getting sugarier and more oxidised with age, and losing its characteristic properties as a result – a rather more subtle collection of multiple phenomena, not just stiffening caused by AGE crosslinks. This has taken a long time to uncover both because the experiments are technically difficult and because the work is interdisciplinary, requiring careful collaboration between chemists and biologists, and such work is often overlooked by funders.

Given the prominence of AGE crosslinks in previous research, most ideas for reversing collagen ageing have focused on getting rid of them. Scientists are working on ‘AGE-breaker’ drugs that can cleave the modifications from the collagen in the hope of restoring its youthful suppleness. Though our new, nuanced understanding of collagen ageing calls the logic of AGE-breakers into doubt, it’s probably still worth trying them. As we’ve mentioned before, the surest way to test if something is an important contributor to ageing is to get rid of it and see what happens. If we can reliably remove AGE crosslinks and it works, great; if tissue flexibility doesn’t change, we might need to enact plan B. This could build on work done developing the AGE-breakers, modifying whatever is found to be effective against AGEs to instead chop off other modifications that are more biologically relevant.

However, the most promising approach might be to avoid meddling with this complex chemistry altogether. We could sidestep our imperfect understanding entirely if we could encourage our bodies to rip up old collagen and replace it from scratch. This is clearly possible in principle – our bodies must have built it in the first place. They are also quite capable of regenerating collagen in many places, albeit not at the required rate：though some collagen lasts a lifetime, careful measurements of collagen longevity in mice suggests that there are some places where it only lasts weeks rather than decades – there’s no hard-and-fast biological reason that we couldn’t emulate our furry counterparts. The good news is that we can stimulate collagen turnover to some extent with exercise：exercise causes mild collagen damage, setting the body’s natural repair and replacement processes in motion. Unfortunately, exercise can only take us so far, and we’re not sure how we might take a more comprehensive medical approach to encouraging cells to ramp up the destruction and rebuilding of the matrix around them.

Optimistically, there’s some reason to hope that tackling other hallmarks of ageing could have a positive effect on our collagen. Firstly, many of the sugar-related reactions with proteins are intrinsically reversible. The increased blood sugar levels associated with both ageing and diabetes mean that sugars are more likely to stick to than fall off, which causes an increase in the number of glycated proteins; better control of blood sugar could turn this process around, allowing the collagen to recover by simple chemistry. Next, the SASP secreted by senescent cells is partly made up of enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix, and there’s also evidence that some dysfunctional immune cells called neutrophils rampage through it in old age, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Thus, removing senescent cells and rejuvenating the immune system may at least slow the damage to the proteins outside our cells. If we get luckier, restoring our bodies to an otherwise youthful state may cause cells which previously did perform adequate levels of collagen maintenance to get back to work – though there may still be some places, like cartilage, where turnover is too slow even at youthful rates.

This is one of the aspects of ageing whose solution seems the least certain at the moment. More research is needed to work out exactly what happens to long-lived proteins outside cells and how to fix it. There are also other proteins that this affects that we’ve not taken much time to discuss：skin and arteries both have another major structural constituent called ‘elastin’ which, as the name suggests, is partly responsible for tissue flexibility; ageing of proteins in the lens of the eye leads to loss of both flexibility and transparency in old age; and more besides.

If we had to choose one area on which to focus this research, I would make the case for the collagen and elastin in the blood vessels – high blood pressure is a leading cause of death, disease and dementia, and degradation of the ECM there almost certainly has the biggest impact on our health. Though improving the collagen in our skin could restore some of its youthful sheen, I would far rather have saggy skin and young arteries than the reverse. We could then turn the tools and techniques developed to revitalise our circulatory system to the other places in our bodies where proteins are modified.





*Technically, the very first few daughters are known as ‘totipotent’ and have greater powers still – not only can they build any cell of the body, but also any cell type outside the embryo which forms part of the interface between mother and developing baby, like the embryo’s parts of the placenta. Pluripotent stem cells can form any body cell, but only a minor part of the placenta known, catchily, as the ‘extraembryonic endoderm’.

*In the case of HSCs, the reverse can also happen：since some of their daughters are immune cells, this donated immune system can recognise its new home as non-self, and go on a dangerous rampage known as ‘graft-versus-host disease’. Doctors actually turn this effect to their advantage in the case of diseases like leukaemia where the donated immune system will target any remnants of the cancer that survived, known as ‘graft-versus-leukaemia effect’. This is considered just as important a part of the treatment as repopulating the HSCs.
