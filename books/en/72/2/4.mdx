title: 8 Reprogramming ageing
---



Having removed, replaced and repaired what we can, the final stage in an actual cure for biological ageing will almost certainly require us to reprogram our own biology, hacking what nature has given us to prevent problematic processes from happening in the first place. Since the ‘program’ for our biology is written in our genes, this will involve editing them to optimise the good stuff, reduce the bad and add new capabilities to our cells and organs.

While this might sound futuristic, there’s plenty we can do in the foreseeable future of medical care. It won’t be long before we can use gene editing to optimise the hand that evolution has dealt us, and we could even perform cellular reprogramming – another name for the process of creating induced pluripotent stem cells – to turn back the clock not just in cells in a dish, but our whole bodies.

These ideas provide us with a glimpse of the final step in biogerontology, and perhaps all of medicine：combining everything we’ve learned so far into intricate computer models of human biology, which will make everything we’ve discussed seem primitive. Once we’ve achieved this goal, we will be truly ageless – and, as ‘ageing’ gradually loses its meaning, we’ll probably cease to call the treatments we devise ‘anti-ageing’ at all.
