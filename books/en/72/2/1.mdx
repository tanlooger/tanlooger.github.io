title: 5 Out with the old
---



Given that ageing is a multifaceted process, treating it is going to require a portfolio approach. Unless we uncover some deeper root cause of ageing, or it turns out that one or just a few of the hallmarks we examined in the last chapter are responsible for most of the problems associated with getting old, there may well be dozens of treatments in our eventual repertoire. The next few chapters will look at how we could intervene in each aspect of the ageing process, with treatments that range from the currently hypothetical, to some nearly ready for deployment.

I’ve divided the treatments into four loose categories, each with a chapter of its own. The first is probably the most intuitive：the removal of bad stuff which accumulates with age. Some of the hallmarks of ageing are simply things which build up in our body as we get older and go on to cause the diseases and dysfunctions of old age. Thus, we need to devise ways to get rid of them.

There are three hallmarks which follow this pattern：aged, senescent cells, whose numbers slowly increase with age; defective proteins and other junk that hangs around inside cells and slowly causes them to work less effectively; and misfolded proteins called amyloids which accumulate both within and between cells and gradually cause problems from heart failure to dementia. The most obvious way to tackle these problems is to remove them at their source.

We’ll start with what’s probably the strongest contender for first anti-ageing treatment to make it to the clinic：removal of senescent cells.
