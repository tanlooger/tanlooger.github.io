title: Notes and bibliography
---




These notes list some of the sources I used while writing. I’ve tried to provide a citation for all the important facts and figures in the text, using sources that are free to read where possible, and giving preference to more accessibly written studies – though obviously scientific papers can sometimes be quite heavy going. Occasionally I’ve referenced particularly good popular science articles, books and videos that often go into greater depth on a specific topic than I’ve had space to in this book. I also haven’t always referenced the primary source where another provides a more readable overview.

All citations are accompanied by a short link, starting with ageless.link/ and followed by a unique code made up of six letters and numbers (e.g. ageless.link/m3gh76). If you type this into a web browser, it will take you to the reference, occasionally with additional information. Visit ageless.link/references for more information.

The average 80-year-old … types of medication … According to the first two studies here, an 80-year-old suffers from an average of three ‘morbidities’ and five to ten ‘diagnoses’. The difference between them is methodological：how many ‘diseases’ someone suffers from depends on what your threshold is, so I said ‘around five’ in the text. The third paper estimates the number of drugs, or ‘polypharmacy’. Thanks to Bruce Guthrie for helping me understand the nuances.

… the result is that [Blanding’s turtles and painted turtles] don’t seem to ageThis paper, published in 2003, documents the original observations showing that these two species of turtle don’t age:

Justin D. Congdon et al., ‘Testing hypotheses of aging in long-lived painted turtles (Chrysemys picta)’, Exp. Gerontol. 38, 765–72 (2003). DOI：10.1016/s0531-5565(03)00106-2 ageless.link/9a7ewp

However, 13 years later, another study looking at a different population of painted turtles and found that they do senesce (albeit slowly). As ever, the devil is in the detail：proposed explanations include methodological differences, or increased extrinsic mortality in the population examined in this study (thought, incidentally, to be caused by humans – boats when in the water, and cars on the land). Tortoise demography is a niche field of research, and these projects take decades, so the debate about how tortoise mortality changes with age won’t be settled any time soon. However, regardless of the outcome, the key point remains：there is an incredible diversity of life courses, and no law of nature precludes negligible senescence. (And, if the extrinsic mortality differences prove to be the clinching difference here, this would further underscore our theories about how ageing evolves.)

Daniel A. Warner et al., ‘Decades of field data reveal that turtles senesce in the wild’, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 113, 6502–7 (2016). DOI：10.1073/pnas.1600035113 ageless.link/tzrfyn

… hydra … 1,000 years old This paper brings together a wealth of life course data for a huge range of species, and shows the incredible diversity of senescence across living organisms – rapid, negligible, negative, and some slightly stranger shapes.

Chapter 4：Why we age

This chapter is largely structured around a paper called ‘The hallmarks of aging’. There is a huge amount of information in the article, but it’s a very dense read!

Carlos López-Otín et al., ‘The hallmarks of aging’, Cell 153, 1194–1217 (2013). DOI：10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 ageless.link/m3gh76

An accessible account of the hallmarks is also given in this presentation to a UK government inquiry into ageing, of which you can watch a video or read a transcript. Other hearings and written evidence to this inquiry are interesting, too.

This paper is a nice review demonstrating how age-related changes don’t map neatly onto a single disease, by examining the relative contributions of the many processes which ultimately make cancer an age-related disease:

… several attempts to systematically classify theories of ageing … One of the first attempts to draw together the large body of disparate knowledge about ageing was written by Alex Comfort in the 1950s. (Comfort was something of a polymath – you may be more familiar with his 1972 book, The Joy of Sex.)

Another well-known attempt in 1990 reviewed the evolutionary and mechanistic theories of ageing in the hope of unifying the subject:

… why hasn’t evolution already done it? The various reasons evolution might not have already moved the mitochondrial genes to the nucleus are explored in this paper. One idea I’ve not mentioned is that the proteins retained in mitochondria might be too ‘hydrophobic’ – prone to bending out of shape when coming into contact with water – which would make their construction in and journey through the water-filled cell interior to the mitochondria impossible without destroying their structure. The ‘local government’ metaphor is more properly called the ‘colocalization for redox regulation’ (CoRR) hypothesis, and is also discussed.

Chapter 11：From science to medicine

This review examines some of the scientific and policy shifts necessary to realise the potential of biogerontology. It also introduces yet another classification of age-related changes, the ‘pillars of aging’!

Brian K. Kennedy et al., ‘Geroscience：Linking aging to chronic disease’, Cell 159, 709–13 (2014). DOI：10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.039 ageless.link/hnoqys

The National Institute on Aging … budget of $2.6 billion … The figures in this and subsequent paragraphs have been compiled from the NIA, NIH, NCI and CMS, and can be found at ageless.link/7679wa

It’s a biogerontology in-joke … This delightfully curmudgeonly comment by Leonard Hayflick (of the Hayflick limit, biogerontology pioneer and founding member of the Council of the NIA) is a great example of the infuriation this causes:

Acknowledgements

The ideas in this book have been my passion for almost a decade, after discovering ageing biology as I was finishing my PhD. I would like to thank everyone who has made this book possible and I hope that, with their help, I have done justice to what I genuinely believe are the most important scientific ideas of our age.

I would like to start by thanking the generations of researchers upon whose work this book is based, and scientists past and present whose names or work I have not been able to mention specifically in this brief tour of biogerontology. You will find some of their names in the references that precede these acknowledgements, but there are of course many more besides. Without the historical and ongoing efforts of the scientific community, there would be no exciting results to report, and we would not find ourselves at this pivotal time in the history of medicine.

I have been humbled by the scientists and others who have given so generously of their time to patiently answer my (often naïve!) questions and read through drafts of this manuscript. In the following lists, names appear in a random order.

First, it has been a huge honour to speak with some truly incredible researchers and others, all of whom have expanded my horizons, brought the ideas I read about in the literature to life and, in some cases, overturned what I’d read with cutting-edge results of their own. Thanks to Nick Lane, Desmond Tobin, Jon Houseley, João Pedro de Magalhães, Adam Rolt, Melinda Duer, Graham Ruby, Mike Philpott, Aubrey de Grey, Linda Partridge, David Gems, Sebastian Aguiar, Jim Mellon, Judith Campisi, Wolf Reik and Anders Sandberg.

Secondly, I would like to thank those who read and commented on drafts of sections of the book. The text is much improved for their thoughtful reviews. Thanks to Jonathan Slack, Hannah Ritchie, Robert J. Shmookler Reis and María Blasco.

Thirdly, special thanks to those who both spoke to me and found the energy to read and comment on drafts as well! Thanks to Hannah Walters, Anna Poetsch, Alejandro Ocampo, Jonathan Clark, Iñigo Martincorena, Adrian Liston, Richard Faragher, Nir Barzilai, Irina and Mike Conboy, Didac Carmona-Gutierrez, João Passos and Michelle Linterman.

I would also like to thank the many people not listed here, from biologists to historians, doctors to actuaries, who replied to my messages or spoke to me briefly to give more details behind work I’d read – from the pedantic and statistical, to the frivolous (such as trying to track down whether the bacterium behind rapamycin was found actually under one of the famous statues on Easter Island as some accounts imply (after disproportionate effort, inconclusive), or asking them to dig up decade-old data so I could accurately report on what day the last worm in an experiment died (see Chapter 3)).

Lastly, I would like to thank three people who were kind enough to read a draft of the entire book. Thank you so much to my friends Tom Fuller and Maya Evans, and especially biogerontologist Lynne Cox, whose fresh eyes and biological insight improved the manuscript in its final stages.

Writing a factual book is never a solo enterprise and, thanks to all of these people, my writing is more accurate, more interesting and more complete. Any errors or omissions are my own.

I would like to thank the Francis Crick Institute for allowing me to continue as a visiting researcher, allowing me to retain access to the scientific literature which underpins this book, in particular to Nick Luscombe for giving a physicist a chance to work in biology, and to the whole Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Lab for helping give me the grounding without which I would not have been able to write it.

I am also hugely indebted to my editors, Alexis Kirschbaum, Kristine Puopolo and Jasmine Horsey, for their faith in my writing, for finding the book you’ve just read hidden in my first draft and for making the editing process thoroughly enjoyable. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the brilliant work of my agent, Chris Wellbelove, and the rest of the team at Aitken Alexander, who guided it masterfully from inception to publication. Many thanks also to everyone else at my UK and US publishers, Bloomsbury and Doubleday, for all of their work proofreading, typesetting, designing beautiful covers, marketing the book, and much more besides.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Tran Nguyen, who has helped shape every part of this book with many hours of discussion, comments on numerous drafts and as an invaluable in-house source of medical expertise, and whose many stories of her older patients struggling with ill health reminded me every day why it was so important to keep writing.

A NOTE ON THE AUTHOR

After obtaining a PhD in physics from the University of Oxford, Andrew Steele decided that ageing was the most important scientific challenge of our time, and switched fields to computational biology. He worked at the Francis Crick Institute, using machine learning to decode our DNA and predict heart attacks using patients’ medical records. He is now a full-time science writer and presenter based in London. He has appeared on the BBC and Discovery.





a note on the type

The text of this book is set in Fournier. Fournier is derived from the romain du roi, which was created towards the end of the seventeenth century from designs made by a committee of the Académie of Sciences for the exclusive use of the Imprimerie Royale. The original Fournier types were cut by the famous Paris founder Pierre Simon Fournier in about 1742. These types were some of the most influential designs of the eight and are counted among the earliest examples of the ‘transitional’ style of typeface. This Monotype version dates from 1924. Fournier is a light, clear face whose distinctive features are capital letters that are quite tall and bold in relation to the lower-case letters, and decorative italics, which show the influence of the calligraphy of Fournier’s time.
