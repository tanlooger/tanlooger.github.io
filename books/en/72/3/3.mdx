title: 11 From science to medicine
---



Curing ageing isn’t just a scientific issue – it’s going to require a shift in our politics, policies and regulations to help breakthroughs in biogerontology progress from research to widespread use. Given the stakes, there’s a huge ethical incentive to move as quickly as we can to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from these treatments. There’s also a personal incentive for many of us alive today – if you’re middle-aged or younger, lucky enough to be in good health and take care of yourself in every way you’re able, the main determinant of how long you will live is progress in medicine that tackles ageing.

This means that, as well as scientific discoveries, ageing research needs advocacy. In this chapter we’re going to look at what needs to change – from telling people about the potential for a medical revolution, to changes in policy and how we do research.

The prerequisite for all of this is a much wider understanding of the significance of the latest results in biogerontology, among everyone from scientists and doctors to politicians and the public. That’s the reason I wrote this book：treating ageing sounds like science fiction until you’ve heard about the latest developments in ageing biology. That means it’s often dismissed by default, covered more as a novelty than a potential reality by the media, and largely ignored by policymakers. Though there is an increasing buzz around the field now, the idea that scientists actually can slow and perhaps reverse ageing in the lab still hasn’t permeated popular perception. A 2013 survey found that 90 per cent of Americans had heard only a little or nothing at all about treating ageing – and, though it’s hard to believe that things haven’t improved a bit in the intervening years, it shows that we started quite recently from a pretty low base.

Scientists are also guilty of this. Because biogerontology has been a small field historically, its recognition even among biologists is surprisingly low. Ageing rarely gets more than a brief mention in undergraduate lectures or textbooks, in spite of it being one of the most universal and significant processes in biology. Unaware of its importance, scientists in training do PhDs in other fields from cancer research to virology. When they come to set up labs of their own, even if they have learned about ageing in the intervening time, there is little incentive to deviate from their expertise and a proven track record in their existing field. This means there are few people to lecture undergrads or accept keen PhD students, which forms something of a vicious cycle. The small size of a field of study can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Step one is therefore raising awareness of the amazing discoveries we’ve discussed so far. None of the other policy changes we need are possible without a widespread understanding that ageing is something we can and should be trying to treat – and this is something all of us can participate in, whether talking to politicians, scientists, or friends and family.

The next step is that biogerontology desperately needs more funding. Research into ageing is currently drastically under-resourced compared to the impact it could have on our health. Many areas of science are arguably underfunded compared to their potential impact, but ageing research fares badly even compared to other scientific fields.

The US is unusual in that it has a government funding body specifically dedicated to ageing research (that this is unusual is of course also a problem). The National Institute on Aging, or NIA, had a budget of $2.6 billion in 2020. That’s less than half of the $6.4 billion budget allocated to the National Cancer Institute, and under 10 per cent of the budget of its parent organisation, the National Institutes of Health or NIH. Ageing causes 85 per cent of deaths in the US, but receives 6 per cent of health research funding – substantially less than research into the diseases that ageing causes.

By stark contrast, the US spends $4 trillion every year on healthcare, a large fraction of which is spent on the chronic conditions of later life. The NIA budget is less than 0.1 per cent of US healthcare spending. Given that research could reduce the cost of the healthcare system with preventative treatments, this is crazy even from an economic standpoint, before we consider the huge human cost of the diseases and disabilities of old age.

The other problem is that funding streams labelled as ‘ageing’ are often used for researching diseases of ageing, rather than ageing itself. It’s a biogerontology in-joke that NIA actually stands for National Institute for Alzheimer’s because its Division of Neuroscience receives more than half of its $2.6 billion budget, while the Division of Aging Biology receives just 10 per cent. And that’s before we get on to the fact that ‘Aging Biology’ concentrates on fundamental research into the mechanisms of ageing, not primarily developing treatments. Fundamental research is critically important, and its discoveries underpin more practical work – but the amount of government funding trying to turn that understanding into actual treatments for ageing is probably in the region of one ten-thousandth the amount of money spent on healthcare in the US.

The US is far from alone in this. Countries around the world spend depressingly little on ageing research, in spite of it being the leading cause of disease, disability and death globally. Biogerontology is in desperate need of more money to find new ways to treat ageing, and turn the ideas we already have into treatments.

Politicians shouldn’t consider funding of ageing research to be a cost, but an investment：one effort to calculate the benefits of anti-ageing treatments found that a modest slowing of ageing resulting in a 2.2-year increase in lifespan and healthspan would be worth seven trillion dollars over 50 years, just considering the health benefits to the US population. The benefits to science and business would be large, too：a government that wanted to invest seriously in ageing medicine would find itself at the forefront of what promises to be one of the world’s largest industries, with a target market of literally every living human.

Science is cheap – even if ‘all’ we get is a few additional healthy years of life apiece, those breakthroughs in biogerontology would be worth the comparatively tiny price tag. If we devoted $10 billion to every hallmark of ageing – surely enough to make some serious progress – it would only set us back $100 billion：2.5 per cent of the US annual spend on healthcare. Spread over a few years, and multiple countries, this kind of investment is surely affordable; and, if it does make serious progress against ageing, we could unseat our incredible progress against infectious disease as humanity’s crowning achievement. We need to petition our governments to invest more in this vital area of research. This should be an easy case to make if only politics were more rational – and the more of us who try to make the case in varied ways which will appeal to different politicians and voters, the greater our odds of success.

Though the biggest bottleneck in biogerontology is undoubtedly funding, there are also more specific ideas which are important to maximise our chances of success – changes in policy which will allow us to capitalise more quickly on scientific results and get them to patients.

The first problem, which you may remember from the Introduction, is that regulators won’t currently approve a drug that treats ‘ageing’, rather than a specific disease. In the short term, this won’t obstruct progress：slowing or reversing hallmarks of ageing will impact on the diseases they cause, and treatments can seek regulatory approval for those conditions first – for example, we’ve already seen how senolytics are in human trials for arthritis and lung disease, and stem cell therapies are being trialled for Parkinson’s, rather than ageing writ large. However, once they’ve proven their worth in specific conditions, the ultimate aim should be to deploy these therapies preventatively in people before they get sick – and scientists are already laying the groundwork to make this possible.

This regulatory impasse is being broken by a team of scientists, led by biogerontologist and doctor Nir Barzilai, who are conducting a revolutionary trial of a thoroughly unrevolutionary drug：metformin. Metformin is used to treat diabetes and is one of the most widely used medicines on the planet – around 80 million prescriptions for it are written every year in the US. It’s also got a long track record, having first been approved in the UK in 1958. This mundane molecule would be ‘just’ an extremely safe and effective diabetes treatment, but for the unexpected positive side effects which seem to accrue to people taking it.

The most striking was a comparison of diabetic patients treated with metformin against those on another popular family of diabetes drugs called sulphonylureas, and also against a ‘control’ group of patients who were the same age and sex but didn’t have diabetes and consequently weren’t taking either drug. Diabetics on metformin lived longer, not just than patients taking sulphonylureas, but they beat non-diabetics by a small margin, too – even though the patients without diabetes were healthier and less likely to be obese. There are also hints that metformin reduces the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia, even though it’s only used for treatment of diabetes. This kind of across-the-board reduction in age-related diseases and death makes it sound like this diabetes drug is having a far more fundamental effect, on the ageing process itself.

Unfortunately, like the diet and exercise studies in the last chapter, this work is all observational so far. It could be, for example, that well-controlled diabetics are more resistant to other diseases of ageing for some reason other than their metformin prescriptions, or perhaps they get more contact with the healthcare system so nascent problems get caught and treated earlier. What is needed is a gold-standard ‘randomised’ trial, where whether or not you receive metformin is random, rather than based on whether or not you have diabetes.

That’s the aim of the TAME trial – short for Targeting Aging with MEtformin – which will recruit 3,000 volunteers between 65 and 80 to test whether the drug is a true anti-ageing treatment. Fifteen hundred will take the real drug and the other 1,500 will get a placebo; after five years or so, its success will be judged by whether the participants in the metformin arm of the trial get any one of a number of age-related diseases, like cancer, heart disease and dementia, later than the control group does.

The team behind TAME isn’t anticipating earth-shattering results：if metformin added decades to human lifespan that would already be obvious given its widespread use. However, where metformin comes into its own is side effects – or rather, the lack of them. After over half a century of prescribing, we know that it causes few serious problems. If you’re trying to convince a risk-averse regulator to let you give pills to what they consider healthy people, then ‘first, do no harm’ is a solid maxim. Metformin was chosen to be the first drug tested for ageing itself precisely because it is pragmatic and middle-of-the-road, the drug equivalent of a family SUV with a top-notch safety record rather than a pharmaceutical supercar that might career off the racetrack. Metformin’s other advantage is that it’s so old, it’s no longer patented. That means generic versions of it can be produced for pence per dose, both reducing the cost of the trial, and meaning that it would be practical to roll out widely if it works.

Even if the trial fails and metformin proves no better than a placebo, TAME’s methodology, developed in close collaboration with the FDA, should provide an off-the-peg regulatory approach for testing future treatments. Though it would be a shame if the first large human trial of a treatment against ageing gets equivocal results, denying biogerontology the opportunity to trumpet the success of its first real-world trial, this model will provide a precedent when scientists and drug companies try to get approval for the next generation of anti-ageing treatments.

The other problem with anti-ageing treatments is that trials take a long time, which also makes them expensive. TAME’s price tag is $70 million, in spite of the fact that metformin is a very cheap drug where we can skip straight to a late-stage trial because we already know a lot about dosage and safety. On the one hand, it’s a little churlish to highlight the price tag：if the trial shows that metformin works and can delay ageing even slightly, it could repay this upfront cost thousands of times over. On the other, this is totally out of reach for academic scientists and a hefty sum even for a pharmaceutical company, illustrating how cost constraints can make developing treatments against ageing tricky.

The expense of late-stage trials is a problem for all kinds of medical treatments but it’s an especially acute one if you want to give an anti-ageing drug to healthy people. A new cancer drug could cause a tumour to recede within weeks, and a longer-term trial may examine how many patients survive to five years without a relapse to demonstrate that it works – and five years is sadly long enough for many of your trial’s patients to die. However, most of a cohort of relatively healthy 60-somethings given an ageing treatment will still be alive after five years whether it works or not, which is obviously great news for them, but bad news for the statisticians trying to quantify the effectiveness of your new wonder drug. If you want to give your drug to healthy 30- or 40-somethings, the problem is magnified even further. Clearly, another approach is needed.

Luckily, there is a scientific solution：using ‘biomarkers’ of ageing, simple tests that can tell you someone’s biological age at a moment in time. We already met one of these in Chapter 4：the ‘epigenetic clock’, which uses chemical flags on your DNA to estimate your age (and odds of death) with unnerving accuracy.

The original epigenetic clock has now been verified many times over in different studies – in fact, it’s proven so robust that labs doing completely unrelated studies on DNA methylation will quickly tot up a patient’s epigenetic age and check that it matches their recorded age to flag up data entry errors. There are also multiple new epigenetic clocks which are less accurate predictors of chronological age – which, if you think about it, we don’t really need to know, because we can deduce it using the far simpler technology of birth certificates – but are better at determining how long you might live, how long until you get cancer or heart disease, and so on.

A new version of the epigenetic clock was developed in 2018 which is a much more accurate predictor of death than the original. It also predicts cancer, Alzheimer’s and, more abstractly, how many diseases someone is likely to simultaneously suffer from in future. Unlike the original epigenetic clock, it also detects if a patient has smoked, or does so currently – a further smoking gun, if you will, suggesting that tobacco accelerates ageing globally, beyond just being really bad for your lungs.

There are many other candidate biomarkers of ageing, from physical examinations like grip strength and ability to stand on one leg* and lung capacity; cognitive tests and measures of vision or hearing; and more scientific-sounding ones like blood tests, brain imaging or analysis of your microbiome. There are also composite measures, which combine some or all of these to give the best possible estimate of a person’s true biological age.

Perhaps simultaneously the most and least surprising ageing biomarker is physical appearance. It turns out we’ve got reasons beyond vanity to envy those who hang on to their fresh faces as the years pass：looking young seems to mean that, biologically, you are young. A 2009 study asked panels of assessors to guess people’s ages based on photographs of their faces. The predictions were tallied up to get an average ‘perceived age’, which turned out to be an accurate predictor of mortality, even after accounting for chronological age. The next step is to automate this idiosyncratic and labour-intensive process with AI, which has been done with some success using both regular photographs of people and three-dimensional maps of their face shape. A team is also in the process of automating this for mice, using image recognition algorithms to deduce a mouse’s biological age from a picture. This would allow researchers to evaluate anti-ageing interventions in mice with just before-and-after photos. Even though mice are much easier and cheaper to work with than humans, using them is still one of the most expensive forms of biomedical research, and this again could help cut costs and speed vital experimentation with anti-ageing treatments.

Measures of biological age, or ‘biomarkers’ of ageing, are therefore incredibly useful. Instead of handing patients some pills and then putting them out to pasture for a decade, we could ask them back after a few months and see if their biological age has changed. If the ticking of their biological clock has slowed or, even better, run backwards, then we can deduce that we might be on to something without needing to wait many years and check who’s still alive. The other significant advantage of biomarkers is that every human or mouse in your trial can provide you with data, rather than just those who have died. This makes them much more statistically efficient, meaning you can get higher-powered studies with fewer participants.

The most important question is whether these biomarkers, good though they are at predicting risk of death or disease, are slowed or turned back by successful anti-ageing interventions. Evidence is accruing that they are. The trial we mentioned in Chapter 6 that used a hormonal treatment to rejuvenate the thymus was accompanied by a reduction in subjects’ epigenetic age. In mice, the ticking of their rodent epigenetic clocks is slowed by dietary restriction, treatment with rapamycin, and in mice with genes which increase lifespan. A 22-month-old mouse on DR, for example, has a biological age of just 13 months, an epigenetic manifestation of the slowing of ageing expected from DR. A similar result in rhesus monkeys showed that those on DR had an epigenetic age seven years younger than those eating what they liked. There’s more to be done to work out which biomarkers perform best under what circumstances, but results like these are a promising start.

If a biomarker as accurate as current epigenetic clocks was meaningfully turned back by anti-ageing treatments, a study equivalent in accuracy to the TAME trial – which needs 3,000 patients, five years and tens of millions of dollars – could theoretically be completed with just a few hundred patients, two years, and perhaps a few million dollars. You can either view this as a bargain-basement way to get the same results, or an opportunity to test dozens of treatments (and combinations of treatments) for the same initial outlay. This is why the quest to find workable biomarkers is a particularly important subfield of biogerontology：ageing has a number of underlying causes, and each one has multiple candidate treatments, so anything that makes testing them quicker and cheaper would be very welcome. Biomarkers of ageing are an enabling technology which will help the wider field advance more quickly, and help us save more lives sooner.

When performing trials, it’s also vital that we stop excluding the most important patients for anti-ageing treatments：old people. New treatments of all kinds are rarely trialled in the elderly, even in cases where they are likely to be the primary users, because old people are ‘too complicated’ in a variety of different ways. From a scientific perspective, you might want to test your new drug in patients who only have the particular disease you’re interested in and not a laundry list of other health problems which might confuse your results. Old people are also often taking multiple different drugs for all those diseases, which may interfere with the treatment you’re testing. Using younger people keeps things simple, making your results easier to interpret. There are also commercial incentives：a trial in young, fit people is more likely to show an unambiguous result which will lead to your treatment being approved. And finally, there are simple but important steps which can be taken to enable older people to participate – such as providing taxis or home visits to help those with reduced mobility – which all too often aren’t taken because they’re expensive and inconvenient for those running the trial.

The end result of this is that we often don’t have good evidence as to whether drugs work in older people. Guidelines for some common types of medication have never been tested in the elderly, meaning, in the worst case, they could be wildly wrong. This systematic, albeit often unintentional, exclusion of old people from clinical trials needs urgent attention. Even though doctors have been saying this for decades, reality is catching up very slowly. There’s a saying in paediatrics that children aren’t just small adults. There should be a similar refrain in geriatrics, that old people aren’t just old young people.

The same problem plays out in mouse studies. ‘Mouse models’ of disease – which we’ve said before are often imperfect analogues – are particularly guilty in this regard. For example, a mouse model of Alzheimer’s might contain an extra copy of the amyloid precursor protein gene, and mice could develop amyloid deposits and cognitive impairment in mouse middle age, or even in youth, unlike most human patients. This means that the mice could be relatively healthy except for the additional amyloid – great if you want to single out its effects, but not so great if you want a realistic model of human dementia.

Using older mice in experiments complicates things, just as it does in human patients, and it’s also more expensive and time-consuming for the prosaic reason that you have to look after your mice for a year or two while they grow old. However, it’s well known that lots of drugs which work flawlessly in mouse models fail to translate to human success. If your drug is for a disease primarily found in older patients, this is one of many possible reasons why. Given that studies in mice are often the precursor to far more expensive human trials, spending more upfront on older mice might ultimately reduce the costs of drug development by spotting duds earlier in the process.

There are some positive steps being taken. For example, some studies on vaccines have started to focus specifically on the older people who need them most. Vaccines which have a stronger ‘adjuvant’, a substance which riles up the immune system to make it fight harder against the vaccine, or jabs which simply contain more active ingredient to prod tired immune cells into action, have both been shown to work better in the elderly. Some studies show that the time of day the vaccine is administered can make a difference, with flu shots given to elderly people in the morning sometimes resulting in an enhanced immune response. More advanced ideas based on our understanding of how the immune system changes with age would be worth exploring, and it’s obviously essential that these are tested in older subjects, whether mice or people.

As well as more testing in authentically old mice and people, we also need lots more work to understand the differences between old and young in more detail. For example, though we know that numbers of senescent cells increase with age, we have very few hard numbers on exactly how much, or how it varies between individuals or parts of the body. Are certain people or organs more afflicted by these cells, and do they have a greater effect in one place or another? Should this affect how we develop senolytic drugs, targeting the most consequential places first?

These important questions are finally starting to be answered with the current flurry of excitement around senolytic treatments, but it’s taken a long time to get to this point. Senescent cells were first discovered in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the late 2000s that someone tried clearing them in mice to see how substantial their effect on ageing organisms is. (Even this pioneering work, incidentally, was funded by cash left over from other grants after an attempt to get funding from the cash-strapped NIH was rejected. After this result was published in 2011, the scientists had more luck with their grant applications.) And this kind of work is comparatively easy to get funding for because it’s interventional – simply counting the number of these cells would be tougher to raise funding for.

We’re going to need a lot more of this kind of work to get a handle on what changes with age and by how much. Another example is mutations, which have been far more extensively studied in cancers than in normal ageing tissue – even though cancers arise from those normal tissues. Without sequencing the DNA of non-cancerous tissue which is merely old, we run the risk of missing crucial findings which could impact on both cancer and the wider ageing process. Similar quantitative investigation is needed for all the hallmarks of ageing – changes in epigenetics, levels and modifications of proteins, numbers of cells, mitochondria, levels of signals, and so on. In the short term, this will inform our first treatments against ageing. Quantification of these processes will supply biomarkers which provide an indication of whether a new drug has achieved its direct goal – for example, whether it’s got rid of a significant number of mutant mitochondria, or altered the balance of age-associated signals in a meaningful way. In the longer run, this kind of data will be essential for the systems biology models we need to build of our ageing bodies.

Finally, we need to prepare ourselves for what happens as evidence for the effectiveness of ageing treatments starts to build up. As individuals, this is a fascinating time to be alive. As we rapidly learn more about treatments which could intervene in ageing, it’s natural to wonder at what point the risks and benefits of a new treatment are well enough characterised to consider taking it. Our current paradigm of medical research works on the precautionary principle, meaning that pharmaceutical companies and regulators expend huge efforts to make absolutely sure that new treatments are completely safe before rolling them out for widespread use. This sounds sensibly cautious, but it neglects that doing nothing can sometimes come with greater risks than doing something, even if that something is not 100 per cent certain to be safe. This problem of balancing risk becomes particularly acute with ageing treatments which, ultimately, we hope will be deployed preventatively – perhaps to a significant fraction of the population – before people become unwell.

We’re all going to need help navigating this new paradigm in medicine, because the calculus involved will be quite different from current drugs. Would you be happy to start taking pills in your forties to slow down your own ageing? How much evidence would you need to see before it seemed like the right call? The fact that we might be committing to a course of treatment while not suffering from any disease without knowing its lifelong effects with certainty is a challenge for regulators and individuals alike. But, equally clearly, we can’t afford to wait for 50-year-long trials to churn out definitive answers when acting sooner has the potential to save and improve millions or billions of lives.

At the same time, we need to keep charlatans at bay. Anti-ageing medicine already has a chequered history of quacks peddling immortality with unevidenced treatments from potions and elixirs to, astonishingly, surgical implantation of animal testicles. It’s hard for non-experts to weigh up the evidence for a treatment, or even to know whether the treatment is chemically or biologically what it claims to be. Smart regulators and solid public information are required to make sure that people don’t waste money or get hurt.

Finally, we should think seriously about how we might standardise protocols and capture data from people who are already self-experimenting with these treatments. It only takes a quick web search to find groups of people speculatively taking metformin for its anti-ageing effects, perhaps by asking their doctor to prescribe it to them in spite of not having diabetes. At the other end of the spectrum of risk to reward, there’s a case of a biotech CEO going to a Colombian clinic to give herself untested, unregulated telomerase gene therapy. There’s clearly a huge appetite for this kind of experimentation – and some professional oversight could make these homespun single-person clinical trials both safer for participants, and more useful for all of us.

If people are going to do it anyway, it would be a terrible waste if their experiments are atomised, idiosyncratic and uncontrolled：we might never find out the results and, even if we did, infinite variations in practical protocol will mean we never really know if their efforts helped them to live longer or not. By introducing at least some of the rigour of a conventional clinical trial, ensuring that participants are using the same dose of the same drug which is what it says it is, these self-experiments could not only be made safer, but provide far more generalisable knowledge about which interventions work and which don’t.

Implementing this would be challenging due to the need to both assess and communicate risk and uncertainty very carefully. But, as a 65-year-old already contemplating a somewhat uncertain therapy, my willingness would be increased if I not only had the chance to live a bit longer in good health, but if my modest gamble could contribute to a better understanding of ageing for the generations who follow.

Clearly, the success of biogerontology depends on more than just science. The essential prerequisites are a much higher profile and far more funding for ageing research. It will need to clear hurdles in policy and regulation and, perhaps most important of all, biogerontology needs to go mainstream, with widespread understanding and discussion of its potential among scientists, policymakers and the public.

I hope this book has convinced you that it’s time for a mission-driven medical moonshot – a massively funded, international programme of research to intervene in the ageing process. It would be bafflingly unlucky if we didn’t find a few new and innovative ways to improve human health, and there’s potential for rewards that are far greater still.

Even if we aren’t fortunate enough to be the first generation of ageless humans, longer, healthier lives will bring enormous benefits, for us and for every future generation.

Every day we bring forward a cure for ageing, we save 100,000 lives. We know it’s scientifically possible. It’s now up to all of us to meet the defining humanitarian challenge of our time.
