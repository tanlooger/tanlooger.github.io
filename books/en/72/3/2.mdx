title: 10 How to live long enough to live even longer
---



With only a small fraction of life expectancy explained by genes, most of your longevity is down to lifestyle and luck. Luck is, by definition, impossible to do anything about – but there are plenty of scientifically backed suggestions to max out your life expectancy based on how you choose to live.

The potential dividends of optimising your lifestyle are large. One study looking at 100,000 health professionals in the US gave them a score based on five healthy behaviours (not smoking, a healthy bodyweight, not drinking too much, regular exercise and eating well), and found that those who ticked four or five boxes aged 50 could expect to live ten years longer, both in total and in years spent in good health, than those who didn’t tick any. Around 40 per cent of cancer and a staggering 80 per cent of cardiovascular disease is thought to be preventable, meaning that, if we all lived an optimal lifestyle, cancer and heart problems would be dramatically deferred. Deciding whether to take a new anti-ageing pill is a hard decision which will involve weighing up complex evidence as it comes in – trying to live a bit more healthily is a no-brainer.

It’s important to remember how hard it is to pin a disease of ageing on any single cause. Imagine you acquire ten mutations which cause a particular cancer, and three were caused by alcohol, one by food and six by unavoidable random DNA damage from being alive. Should you chalk it up to bad lifestyle, or bad luck? It’s like Murder on the Orient Express：no individual actor is really responsible. Living well improves your odds, but it can never reduce them to zero. The more optimistic perspective is that it should absolve you of overly detailed soul-searching for the precise cause if you do get diagnosed with cancer or have a heart attack, while at the same time empowering us all because lifestyle improvements really can help – even cancer, which can seem completely out of our hands, is not entirely a matter of chance.

It’s also important to mention that it’s never too late to start with any of these health tips, because the changes in our bodies as we age are cumulative. If a change to your lifestyle slows the accumulation of mutations in your DNA that make cancer more likely, it will help no matter how old you are when you start：if a cell teetering on the brink of cancer just needs one more mutation, even preventing that single extra change could save your life. Studies on exercise programmes bear this out – exercising improves health even in 80-somethings, and it’s often those who are the least healthy to begin with who benefit the most. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, as the saying goes – but the second-best time is today.

The advice which will help you live the longest is surprisingly basic in some ways, but it’s also worth saying that following this advice isn’t always easy, and requires both opportunity and willpower. However, now that you know a lot more about the biology of ageing than before, I hope that understanding the science behind them will make even familiar suggestions far more compelling.
