title: 9 The quest for a cure
---



Curing ageing is a hugely important humanitarian goal which would alleviate suffering on the grandest possible scale. It will benefit every future generation of humans; if we don’t blow ourselves up or upload ourselves into simulated brains in the next few centuries, it could benefit billions, even trillions of people. There is no doubt that it is worth pursuing, especially now that we know it is scientifically possible.

But there’s one question which everyone reading this book is at least wondering about, no matter how altruistic：will a cure for ageing come in time for us? If not us, maybe for our children? And how can we move things along to bring forward the end of the age of ageing? This final part of the book will explore that question. In the next few chapters, we’ll explore what you can do now to give yourself the best chance of living a long and healthy life, and what scientists, doctors, governments and societies should be doing to maximise our collective chances.

The path to a cure won’t be easy. We know from bitter experience that the journey from lab research to clinical medicine is tough, with many brilliant, elegant, robust ideas turning out to be a biological nightmare to put into practice. Turning findings from some long-lived mice into a drug or treatment is an endeavour that takes years, maybe decades, and millions or billions of pounds. It is often derailed by side effects, unforeseen differences between mice and humans, or just not working for no good reason. One potential benchmark is the billions and decades we’ve spent on cancer research without finding a cure. The goal sounds simple enough – ‘remove the diseased cells from the body’ – but the challenges in implementation have been enormous.

However, there are lots of reasons to be optimistic. We’ve met many fundamentally different ways to extend the healthy lifespans of mice：dietary restriction, senolytics, telomerase, and even being sewn to a younger mouse. Though there’s almost certainly a bit of mechanistic overlap given the interconnectedness of biology, this eclectic list should surely banish any remaining inklings that ageing is inevitable, or that interventions which slow or reverse it are weird quirks of the lab environment. This expansive list of techniques suggests that ageing is actually rather malleable, and there are many different ways to slow it down. Not only that, but it means we have lots of bites at the cherry – we’d have to be phenomenally unlucky for every variation of every single one of these diverse interventions not to pan out at all in people.

We know that all treatments have side effects, but some of the unintended consequences of the treatments we’ve discovered are positive. Senolytics, for example, improve conditions from osteoporosis to liver disease in mice, because the removal of senescent cells impacts so many different biological processes. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidant MitoQ, which we met in Chapter 7, improves the function of telomeres, but we also know that activating telomerase improves mitochondrial function. We saw in the last chapter that the genes Klotho and FGF21 had an unexpected negative interaction, but some genes, rather than fighting, synergise. One particularly spectacular example was discovered in 2013 in C. elegans：if you take daf-2, whose mutants, you may remember from Chapter 3, live roughly twice as long as normal worms, and another gene called rsks-1, whose mutants live about 20 per cent longer, and create worms in which both genes are mutated, they live almost five times longer than normal – an effect far larger than the simple sum of its parts. Because treating aspects of ageing improves function in a variety of ways, we can hope for virtuous circles, where treatment x rejuvenates process y which in turn alleviates problem z which was never an intended target of x in the first place.

Finally, treating ageing itself starts a virtuous circle of increasing life expectancy. At the moment, every year you’re alive sees your probable date of death recede a few months into the future, and a significant part of this is because you’re living through continuous advances in biomedical science. Those extra months carry on accruing, buying more time for more biomedical advances to add more months, and so on. We’ve already seen this effect work for previous generations：medicine, public health and hygiene meant that millions of children didn’t die of infectious diseases in the 1930s, allowing the surviving 60-somethings to benefit from the new heart disease treatments of the 1990s and 2000s which weren’t even on the drawing board when they were born. This cohort lived far longer than it would have done if medical progress had been frozen in the year of their birth.

If we can develop treatments against the ageing process, people alive at the time the treatment is developed will get to live slightly longer, buying time to develop the next round of anti-ageing medicine, and so on. As a bonus, it’s likely that these treatments for ageing will provide a greater uptick in life expectancy than a treatment for one specific disease will. We have already seen how even a complete cure for cancer would only add a few years to life expectancy, so a new, more effective treatment for a particular type of cancer will add even less because not everyone in the population gets that particular type of cancer. A treatment for ageing, on the other hand, could delay all cancers, as well as heart disease, stroke and dementia, thus adding far more to life expectancy even if it’s only partially effective.

The crucial moment comes if we can start developing and rolling out treatments for ageing that mean life expectancy rises by one year per year. That would mean, on average, our date of death would be receding into the future as fast as we were all chasing it. If we can keep up this pace of innovation, that could continue to be true into the indefinite future – and it would be a de facto cure for ageing. This idea is sometimes called ‘longevity escape velocity’.

Whether a one-year-per-year increase in life expectancy is possible in a time frame which might be relevant to humans alive today is impossible to predict, and most scientists wouldn’t blame you for being sceptical of its plausibility. However, the idea of developing treatments which buy us time to develop more and better treatments changes the nature of the challenge when it comes to adding substantial amounts to life expectancy, or even, one day, curing ageing entirely.

A ‘cure’ for ageing as we usually imagine the word would be a single treatment which totally stopped your body from ageing at all. That is, quite simply, impossible given our present state of knowledge. It would need us to have the full systems biology understanding of ageing we discussed in the previous chapter, today – to re-engineer human biology from the ground up. If instead we can ‘merely’ increase life expectancy through conquering ageing piece by piece, we can develop a cure in practice, but without needing to be nearly so clever to do so：we only need to be smart enough to stay one step ahead of ageing. Even if you remain sceptical of anyone touting a time frame, it’s undeniable that this approach vastly reduces the complexity of the problem and brings forward the date of this medical revolution dramatically.

However and whenever we do manage to cure ageing, this is how it will happen：the cure for ageing will be a jigsaw of treatments which evolves with time, a succession of technologies which gradually improve life expectancy to the point that people will notice that they’ve stopped ageing – not a miraculous magic bullet discovered in a flash of insight by a lone genius. The first ageless generation probably won’t realise their luck at first – they’ll grow up expecting to die at 100, or 150, or whatever ‘old’ is for their society but, one after another, lifesaving medical breakthroughs will push their funerals further and further into the future. It will be very hard to call when we’ve cured ageing if you live through it, constantly wondering if the next breakthrough could be the last and life expectancy will finally stall – but it will be blindingly obvious with hindsight, surveying centuries of life expectancy statistics, and spotting the point where people just stopped dying of old age.

So, if you want to live a very long time, what you have to hope is that our first generation of anti-ageing therapies can tide us over for a few decades until systems medicine can begin to suggest more nuanced treatments, which then buy us another few decades for those treatments to improve. It’s far from an absurd hope：senolytics could be just a few years away, albeit most likely for specific diseases rather than the ageing process itself at first. More advanced treatments like gene and stem cell therapies could be available on timescales measured in decades – soon enough to matter for many of us. One way or another, we will eventually start adding a year or more to life expectancy every year – the only question is when, and how we can maximise our chances of still being alive when it does.

That’s what the next two chapters will cover：first, how to maximise your personal chance of living as long as possible, looking at how the science of ageing translates into health advice; then, what governments and society need to do to make this biomedical revolution happen as soon as possible. All of these tips are win-win：the worst-case scenario is that you live a longer, healthier life sufficient to benefit from as-yet-uninvented medical treatments, and bring forward the date of ageing being cured for our children, or their children; the best case is that some people alive today might live dramatically longer in good health than we currently expect. Let’s look at how to make that happen.
