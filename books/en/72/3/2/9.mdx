title: 9. Don’t bother with supplements
---




Unless you have a specific vitamin deficiency which you need supplements to treat, the evidence doesn’t support the use of the various vitamin pills on the market. As we noted in Chapter 7, a gold-standard review of trials involving almost 300,000 people found that vitamin supplements either had no effect on risk of death or, in the case of beta-carotene and vitamin E, slightly increased it.

In spite of this damning synthesis and the decades of failed trials it summarises, the antioxidant myth persists：supplements remain popular with the public, with around half of US adults reporting that they take them regularly. Vitamins sound healthy, and popping a pill is easier than improving your diet or doing more regular exercise; but you’d be far better off spending any money you would have used for supplements on vegetables, or saving up for a pair of running shoes.
