title: 8. Monitor your heart rate and blood pressure
---




There’s an increasing proliferation of apps and devices to quantify every aspect of your life, but probably the most valuable is the humble automated blood pressure cuff. By measuring your heart rate and blood pressure you can get a significant insight into the state of your cardiovascular health – which, given that heart disease, stroke and vascular dementia are common causes of death and disability, is a significant insight into your health overall.

Every heartbeat ejects a surge of blood into your aorta – your central artery. The circulatory system is structured like a tree：the aorta is the trunk, while increasingly smaller vessels are the branches and twigs, delivering blood to every corner of your body. A blood pressure monitor gives you two numbers, like 120 over 80 (both are measured in a slightly archaic unit of pressure, millimetres of mercury). The first, larger number is called the systolic pressure, and it measures the pressure wave which spreads throughout your body from your heart as it beats; the second, smaller number is the diastolic pressure, which is the minimum pressure in your blood vessels between heartbeats. Arteries with soft, elastic walls can absorb the force of the heart’s pressure wave, meaning that the ever-smaller vessels further from the heart experience less of it. Glycation and loss of collagen and elastin, atherosclerotic plaques, TTR amyloid and other processes make blood vessels narrower and stiffer – and these inflexible arteries transmit the shockwave’s full force. Those same processes also make the vessels more brittle, and the final, tiny vessels are extremely delicate：pummeling them with too high a pressure over and over, 60 or 100 times a minute, all day, every day, can eventually cause them to burst.

The most serious and sudden side effects of a burst blood vessel occur if it affects a medium-sized vessel in the brain, causing a bleeding, or haemorrhagic, stroke. This leads to blood pooling rather than flowing through that part of the brain and, within minutes, nearby brain cells start to die from lack of oxygen. It’s also possible for smaller vessels to burst, which may not be immediately noticeable, but many small events over time can contribute to vascular dementia. High blood pressure also damages delicate structures in the kidneys that filter our blood, can cause blood vessels in the back of the eye to dilate or burst, and also has more unexpected effects like reducing bone strength.

High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a silent killer. Globally, around 40 per cent of people over the age of 25 suffer from it – but you can’t feel high blood pressure, nor does it have any immediate symptoms. That’s why you need a blood pressure cuff：sit down, relax, take a few deep breaths, take a measurement, and keep a note so you can watch for trends over time. Blood pressure is considered normal if it’s below 120/80. From about 115/75, every additional 20/10 roughly doubles the risk of death from heart disease or stroke – so 135/85 means twice the risk, 155/95 is four times as dangerous, and so on. If your blood pressure is regularly above 120/80, it’s probably worth trying to improve your diet or exercise a bit more – these simple interventions are an excellent way to reduce blood pressure. If you consistently get results of 140/90 or more and your doctor doesn’t already know about it, it’s worth scheduling an appointment to discuss it with them, and considering starting on medication. Home blood pressure readings are invaluable because a lot of people get markedly higher readings when they’re done by a doctor – a phenomenon delightfully known as ‘white-coat hypertension’.

It’s also worth keeping an eye on your heart rate. Most automated blood pressure cuffs will give you a heart rate readout at the same time as they measure your blood pressure. Your ‘resting heart rate’ should be somewhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute, though if you’re very fit it can drop a bit lower. As we noted in Chapter 4, a resting heart rate of 100 bpm instead of 60 approximately doubles your risk of death. Intriguingly, the risk that doubles is death from any cause, not just heart disease – a high resting heart rate also correlates with increased risk of cancer. The prescription is similar to that for high blood pressure：losing some weight and getting more exercise can bring a fast-beating heart down to a healthier rate.
