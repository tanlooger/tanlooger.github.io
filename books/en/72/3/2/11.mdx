title: 11. Be a woman

We’ll finish with arguably the least helpful piece of advice：being born a woman can improve your life expectancy by somewhere around five years. There are a variety of social factors which could contribute to this, including more smoking, drinking and risk-taking behaviour in men, as well as more differences in occupations between men and women. However, there are also a few biological explanations for the difference in lifespan between the sexes.

You probably remember from school biology that we all have two ‘sex chromosomes’, and women usually carry XX while most men’s are XY. What this nomenclature doesn’t illustrate is that the Y is a stubby little thing a third the size of the X, containing dramatically fewer genes. This means that men don’t have a ‘backup’ copy of a gene if there’s a problem with one of those on their single X chromosome. This is why colour blindness is more common in men. There are two genes essential for colour vision stored on the X chromosome：OPN1LW or OPN1MW are responsible for proteins that detect red and green light. If you’re a man and one of these genes has a problem, your Y chromosome can’t make up the difference and this results in an inability to distinguish red from green. Missing genetic backups have far more subtle effects when it comes to the rate of ageing, but it’s observed throughout the animal kingdom that whichever sex has non-matching sex chromosomes tends to have a shorter life expectancy. In birds, for example, males have ZZ chromosomes and females ZW, and males tend to be the longer-lived sex.

It’s also speculated that mitochondria may play a role in the longevity gap, thanks to the peculiar way we inherit them：exclusively from our mothers. Every one of your mitochondria is a descendant of the several hundred thousand in the egg which went on to become you, which means that a tiny fraction of your DNA (that in the mitochondria) comes not from a mixture of both your parents, but from just the maternal side. This is very strange from an evolutionary standpoint：a man with a mutation in his mitochondrial DNA that gave him a huge reproductive advantage would be unable to pass on the very mitochondrial DNA which had conferred the advantage, while a similar mitochondrial mutation in a woman would be passed on to her many daughters, and their daughters, and so on. Because of this asymmetry of mitochondrial inheritance, their evolution may improve the lot of women, without caring too much about their effect on men, resulting in a sprinkling of mitochondrial characteristics that slightly improve female fitness compared to male.

Finally, sex hormones are likely to play a role. We found out in Chapter 6 that eunuchs and castrated male prisoners outlived their contemporaries – in the case of the eunuchs, by a significant margin. If the eunuch data are to be believed, their exceptional lifespans suggest that men have the biological robustness to live longer than women, but for testosterone conspiring to kill us. (Presumably testosterone improves reproductive success at young ages, meaning that men can blame their shorter lives on sex-specific antagonistic pleiotropy.)

One piece of news that very slightly offsets the raw deal for men is that, curiously, though women live longer, they tend to do so with worse health on average. There is still some debate about the size and even the existence of this phenomenon, but perhaps the most compelling data come from centenarians：one study found that women over the age of 100 outnumber men by four to one, but that 37 per cent of the centenarian men didn’t suffer from any of the 14 age-related diseases in the study, compared to just 21 per cent of the women.

Though being born a woman is uniquely useless advice for around half the population, it’s actually the case that many of the other items on this list can be difficult or impossible for many people. For example, health problems (including those caused by advanced age) can stop people from undertaking as much exercise as they’d like; money and time constraints can make eating well more difficult for some people; planning of towns and cities can make healthy activities like commuting on foot or by bike difficult, and so on. And, though prevention is better than cure and it’s never too late to start, some people are already old and unwell. Finally, advice like this won’t reliably get everyone to a ripe old age in good health. It’s little consolation to a clean-eating marathon runner who dies in their fifties that they were statistically better off than people who led less healthy lives.

For all these reasons, though dispensing health advice is hugely important, there’s far more that ageing biology can do to help us all lead longer, healthier lives. The next chapter will look at how we can go beyond living well individually, and help everyone live longer in good health – what governments need to do, how research needs to change, and how we all, as citizens and voters, can work to ensure a longer life for everyone thanks to biogerontology.
