title: 2. Don’t eat too much
---




It won’t come as a surprise that what you eat can have a significant effect on how long you live. Getting a balanced diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and nuts is important and can add substantially to your healthspan and lifespan. Exactly what combination of foods is optimal is extremely hard to establish and, as a result, hotly contested. The ideal experiment, in which you randomised thousands of people to different relative quantities of a variety of foods for multiple decades, would be impractical, hugely expensive and probably unethical. This means that scientists are left to pick through observational studies – and, since people’s eating habits are tied up with their wealth, social status, general interest in health and genetics, all of which will also influence their lifespan, it’s very hard to pick apart cause and effect.

The result is that the best advice is probably pragmatic：eat a good mix of different foods, not too much of any one thing, while watching the amount of very sugary, fatty or processed food you eat, and not drinking too much alcohol. Binging on the latest ‘superfood’ almost certainly won’t transform your health, but maintaining a healthy balanced diet certainly can.

It might also be beneficial to cut down on your meat consumption if you eat a lot. The observational evidence in favour of vegetarianism is suggestive but not entirely clear, but there are several biological mechanisms by which a plant-based diet could be better for you. Eating more fruit and vegetables has been shown to improve the diversity of your microbiome. Obtaining your protein from plant rather than animal sources may also cause a kind of dietary restriction. Plant proteins have a different ratio of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – which is less optimal for human needs than animal protein but, ironically, this could be better for us thanks to amino acid restriction being a type of DR. Finally, tiny quantities of defensive toxic chemicals produced by plants might actually be slightly poisonous to us – but to a sufficiently small extent that our bodies overcompensate when removing them and repairing the damage they cause, making us healthier overall. The concept that a little bit of stress can induce stress responses which actually make us healthier is called ‘hormesis’, and might be applicable to other lifestyle tips too.

However, there is one key finding when it comes to diet and lifespan：a large body of evidence suggests that excess fat is bad for you. Some research has found that being a little overweight is good for long-term health, but they, too, are observational studies mired with confounding and complicating factors：people who are underweight, especially in old age, have often lost weight due to illness; weight is related in complex ways to socioeconomic status, which has profound effects on health; body mass index (aka BMI), which is usually used in these studies, is too simplistic a measure; and so on.

Overall, however, it seems likely that shedding a few pounds would lower most people’s risk of many of the diseases of old age, all at once. In spite of its limitations, looking at the life expectancy of people with different BMIs does give us some idea of the opportunity here. BMI is calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by your height in metres, squared. The ‘normal range’ is often quoted as 18.5–25 kg/m². Having a BMI over 25 kg/m² is ‘overweight’, and might knock a couple of years off your life expectancy; more than 30 kg/m² is ‘obese’ and will lower your lifespan by a few more; and being heavier still can knock a full decade off your life. Being overweight will probably knock even more years off your healthspan：the increased risk of heart disease and diabetes means heavier people are likely to spend their later years in poor health. In fact, obese people not only tend to live less long, but actually incur greater health expenses in spite of their shorter lifespan. All this suggests that carrying excess weight is worth avoiding.

Years spent overweight conspire to basically accelerate ageing. This is because fat isn’t the passive store of energy we might imagine it to be – fat deposits are more correctly known as adipose tissue, which is made up of cells called adipocytes whose job it is to store the fat. Where the adipose tissue is located makes a big difference to the effects it has. ‘Subcutaneous’ fat lies just below the skin (the stuff you can grab), and ‘visceral’ fat accumulates deep inside our bodies in the spaces between our organs (which I would definitely not recommend grabbing). Visceral fat seems to be by far the worse of the two, emitting pro-inflammatory molecules which fuel chronic inflammation. It might not actually be the adipocytes themselves that are responsible for the inflammatory overload, but immune cells which reside between them – but this distinction doesn’t really matter to our ageing bodies.

The importance of visceral fat in this process is the reason why it’s worse to be ‘apple-shaped’ – to have a fat belly – than ‘pear-shaped’ – carrying fat on your hips and bum. The rounder, ‘beer belly’ look results from fat in our abdomen between our organs, inflating our tummies from deep within – in other words, inflammatory visceral fat. Fat on the legs, hips and bottom, by contrast, is mainly stored safely just beneath the skin as the relatively benign, subcutaneous stuff. Before the menopause, women tend to accumulate fat more on their bum and men more on their tummy, though obviously it varies. You can, of course, have both.

Simple statistics based on body measurements provide circumstantial (and circumferential) evidence against visceral fat. In the epidemiology literature, BMI’s shortcomings mean that it’s currently battling a number of other measures and ratios as best predictor of age-related ill health. A top contender is waist-to-height ratio which involves measuring around your waist and dividing it by your height, in whatever units you like as long as they’re both the same. Its normal range runs from 0.4 to 0.5, though some people do score slightly lower. Also, if you’re over 50, the normal range is relaxed slightly and it’s probably okay to edge up a little to 0.6 without adding substantially to your risk of getting ill.

The most well-known objection to BMI is that muscle is denser than fat, meaning that if you’re especially muscular you can end up with a BMI which tips you into the overweight range without actually being fat. (Unfortunately for most of us, you have to be pretty ripped to use this as an excuse.) Another trick BMI misses is distinguishing subcutaneous and visceral fat – BMI doesn’t care if you’re carrying excess kilos under your skin or around your organs, reducing the accuracy of its health predictions. Waist-to-height ratio improves on this – your waist circumference is related to how much padding there is in your interior. Accordingly, some studies show that it does better at predicting the likelihood of having a heart attack or developing diabetes than BMI.

Being overweight also puts you at risk of diabetes, which exacerbates many of the problems of ageing. If you are diabetic, evidence suggests that losing weight and reducing your blood sugar levels may be able to get these problems under control, dramatically reducing the risk of a whole swathe of illnesses that diabetes exacerbates if you can manage to keep the weight off.

There’s also evidence that cutting back on sugar can have health benefits, in part because it will reduce the quantity of glycated proteins in your body. It might be that some sugars are worse than others in this regard – fructose reacts more readily with proteins in a test tube, for example, and it’s been suggested that it could be a more potent initiator of glycation when eaten, too. Another, more speculative suggestion is that it might be worth cutting back on AGEs – the advanced glycation end products that sugars form when they react with proteins – in your diet. We still haven’t nailed down the chemistry behind the formation of AGEs on our proteins, and it’s possible that any AGEs you consume ready-made may be able to stick to your collagen and other proteins and cause problems. This means avoiding food cooked at high temperatures which accelerate AGE-ing, such as fried or roasted foods, and preferring to eat things that are raw, boiled or stewed. However, given their ubiquity and deliciousness, dietary AGEs are quite hard to avoid.

If you’ve already dieted and exercised your way to a healthy weight, you might be wondering if you should go further. I promised in Chapter 3 that we’d return to the topic of dietary restriction in humans. We should start by examining the results of DR in the closest evolutionary relatives it’s been tried in：rhesus macaques. In 1987 and 1989, experiments were launched by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a total of just under 200 monkeys.

First, the good news for DR：monkeys fed a normal diet lived 21 years without disease, while the DR groups enjoyed an extra five-plus years disease-free in both studies. If this result translated into humans, with the simplistic assumption that every monkey year is two or three human years, that could easily mean an extra decade free from age-related disease. However, the results for longevity are rather more confusing. The Wisconsin macaques showed a clear benefit of DR：the control group lived an average of just over 25 years, while the calorie-counters made it to nearly 29. Again, translated naïvely into human years, that’s not far off a decade. By contrast, the NIA monkeys, whether DR or control animals, had statistically indistinguishable lifespans.

Perhaps the simplest explanation for these disappointing results is that there are diminishing returns to DR in longer-lived animals like monkeys (and people). Once you’ve got a basically healthy diet, the theory goes, there’s less to be gained by restricting your food further. The Wisconsin monkeys’ diet was made up of pellets of protein, sugar, oil and vitamins, relatively high in fat and sugar, and the non-DR monkeys were allowed to eat as much of it as they liked – a problem perhaps compounded by the pellets being so deliciously fatty and sugary – making the contrast between them and their DR compatriots stark. By contrast, the NIA monkeys were fed a mix of beans, grain and fish which was higher in fibre, lower in fat and sugar, resulting in a healthier diet for the control animals.

Thus, the monkeys’ collective diets lie on a sliding scale of quality, running from the unhealthy Wisconsin control monkeys, via the Wisconsin DR and NIA control groups whose diets were in the middle somewhere, to the NIA DR monkeys, whose food was both the healthiest and the most restricted. By this logic, there’s an advantage to moving from dietary excess – the monkey equivalent of all-you-can-eat hamburgers and sugary soft drinks – to a more modest intake; but eating less still, like the NIA DR group did, won’t add much to your lifespan if you’re already eating a moderate amount of nutritious food. That said, the NIA’s monkeys did still gain five extra years disease-free – something most of us would jump at, even if we didn’t live longer as a result.

Hawkish proponents of DR contend that these studies were flawed and understate its potential benefits, and technical differences between the two experiments provide enough fuel for years of debate. However, the fact that the results are hard to interpret is itself evidence that we can’t hope for a massive effect in animals like us – if DR nearly doubled lifespan like it does in nematode worms or rats, a lack of perfect equivalence between two experiments shouldn’t mask such a huge effect.

There have been studies in humans：DR results in significant weight loss and improves markers of health (things like blood pressure, cholesterol, levels of inflammation, and so on), but we don’t know how it affects lifespan because the studies so far have been too short to check. The other line of (non-)evidence for DR in humans is observational. Throughout history, individuals, societies and religions have practised many and varied diets, out of choice and necessity. One oft-cited example is the unusual longevity of people in Okinawa, a tropical island south-west of mainland Japan, which has been pinned on their culture of nutrient-dense but low-calorie diets. However, it’s hard to be sure – there may be other cultural or genetic effects at play which are unique to the island. And the effect isn’t that dramatic anyway：Okinawans only live about a year longer than people in the rest of Japan, rather than reliably attaining triple-digit lifespans. The effect is also slowly disappearing, which is thought to be due to the increasing westernisation of the islanders’ diet.

DR also comes with side effects. DR mice with flu die more often than their peers on normal diets – eating less, even with optimal nutrition, seems to be bad for the immune system. In humans, a few participants in one trial were forced to stop due to anaemia (a condition where a lack of red blood cells or oxygen-carrying haemoglobin leaves your organs short on oxygen) or significant drops in bone density. DR practitioners also report feeling the cold more easily, increased irritability and lower sex drive. DR mice might live longer in a clean, calm lab environment, kept meticulously free from infection – but as a human who wants to get out and about and actually do stuff, it’s no use being at slightly lower risk of age-related disease if you end up frequently breaking your leg, or dying young of influenza.

When you eat as well as what you eat can have an effect. ‘Intermittent fasting’, recently popularised as the ‘5:2 diet’, involves eating far less, or perhaps nothing at all, for a day in every few. The 5:2 diet, for example, suggests cutting back to 600 calories on two non-consecutive days in a week, and eating normally on the other five. ‘Alternate-day fasting’ goes a little further and requires low or zero eating every other day. ‘Periodic fasting’ means not eating for five-plus days in a row, anywhere from once a month to annually. Finally, ‘time-restricted feeding’ confines eating to a window typically ranging from 6 to 12 hours a day.

Evidence on these different DR variants is harder to unpack even than for DR overall, due to less experimental data. The practical idea behind them is that they’re easier to stick to, allowing devotees to eat as normal when not fasting, and only endure limited rather than continuous bouts of hunger. More theoretically, arguments rage about whether fasting works by the same mechanisms as ‘conventional’ DR or subtly different ones, which governs whether we’d expect the effects to be equivalent or not.

So, should you take up one of these draconian diets? The short and infuriating answer, in spite of decades of experiments, is that we simply don’t know. It feels like we’re tantalisingly close to an answer – the more you read about DR, the harder it gets to shake the nagging feeling that there is some optimal diet out there, waiting to be found. The enduring popularity of fad diets and ‘superfoods’ reflects our intimate, ambivalent relationship with eating, and a deeply held intuition that what we put into our bodies can have a profound effect on health and lifespan. Food is an emotive, engaging topic for many of us. From a more practical standpoint, DR and fasting are also very simple and cheap – you could literally start doing either right now and, far from being costly to implement, it would probably save you money because you could buy less stuff during the weekly shop.

However, I find it hard to recommend a diet which might leave you immune-compromised, thin-boned, chilly and irritable. Certainly if you were thinking of trying DR or any of its variants, you’d be well advised to talk to your doctor first, and set up some monitoring for the potential side effects. I don’t think we’ll ever know the full story about DR, or optimising our diet in general, before it’s too late：there are so many variables in what and when we eat that I think we’ll cure ageing and render the fine details of diet irrelevant before we fully figure it out.

It’s important not to obsess over optimising diet, chasing some elusive, possibly nonexistent perfection, and lose sight of the big picture. Though the evidence is complex, we can’t throw our hands in the air and gorge on all the cake we like：unless you’re already skinnier than most, losing weight will probably do you some good. Both as individuals choosing what we eat and a society choosing policies to adopt, we should be looking to reduce obesity. Helping overweight people into the normal range of BMI is both easier and more unambiguously beneficial than trying to get already healthy people to engage in DR.

So, try to eat a balanced diet, and not too much of it. Though the diet debate will no doubt roll on indefinitely, the key findings are that variety is good, and that being overweight is bad for you because it literally accelerates the ageing process.
