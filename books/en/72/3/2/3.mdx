title: 3. Get some exercise
---




Exercise is good for your health, and it doesn’t need to be in intimidating amounts：studies show that every minute’s increase in exercise or decrease in time spent inactive per day reduces your risk of death. Exercise is also known to reduce the risk of dozens of diseases, including the most significant age-related ones which you can no doubt reel off by now – it even fends off cognitive decline and dementia. It also seems likely that the first, small steps are the most significant, with increasing time or intensity providing diminishing returns. Starting small by trying to fit a five- or ten-minute walk in every day pays dividends for your health and helps to make doing a bit more seem less intimidating over time.

If your lifestyle is entirely sedentary, even half an hour per day of light physical activity can reduce your odds of death by 14 per cent. Ten to fifteen minutes of moderate exercise a day goes further, roughly halving your risk of death from any cause. Exercising for 30 minutes a day helps a bit more. Benefits beyond this are unclear – most studies find something of a plateau and perhaps even a small increase in risk, but it’s hard to be sure because so few people do sufficiently huge quantities of exercise that it’s difficult to draw statistically robust conclusions. In any case, there’s no quantity of exercise which is riskier than doing none at all, meaning it’s not an excuse to stay sedentary – but, if you’re already running for an hour every day, it’s unlikely you’ll experience any benefit from upping that to 90 minutes.

Studies do find that Olympic athletes have lower mortality than the general population, but it’s not clear that this is down to how much exercise they do. Firstly, it might be that the causation runs the other way here：perhaps Olympians are able to endure punishing training regimes and compete at such a high level because their bodies are more robust than the average person’s. Secondly, there may be entirely different mechanisms at play：chess champions also live longer, by a similar amount to elite athletes; and Nobel Prize winners tend to outlive similarly high-flying scientists who were nominated but didn’t win the award by a year or two as well. These studies are intriguing, and suggest that acclaim itself may be medicinal – undermining the simple idea that extreme physical fitness alone is behind Olympians’ longevity.

For us mere mortals, it’s not just cardio which pays dividends – resistance training can help fend off the decline in muscle size and strength experienced by older adults too. We lose about 5 per cent of our muscle mass and 10 per cent of our strength every decade after the age of 30, and the rate more than doubles after age 70. This decline is called sarcopenia – the technical term for age-related loss of muscle mass. Research shows that this loss of strength can be substantially reversed by resistance training. As usual, it’s never too late to start：exercise programmes have been shown to improve the health of 90-somethings, with a two-month programme of resistance training nearly doubling nonagenarians’ muscle strength, and increasing their walking speed by 50 per cent.

When you exercise, there are dozens of changes to your metabolism, circulation, bones, and even the nerves which connect your brain to your muscles. Exercise increases the length of telomeres, reduces the number of senescent cells in muscle and increases the number of ‘satellite cells’ (the stem cells that renew muscle), and also increases the activity of other stem cells around the body. Exercised muscle contains more and better mitochondria than sedentary muscle does. Exercise may result in the destruction and rebuilding of ageing collagen, meaning that stiff, glycated fibres are replaced with fresh new ones. It also reduces inflammation：taken together, our muscles are the biggest organ in our body, meaning that the signals they secrete are significant in volume. Static muscle tends to promote inflammation, while active muscle does the opposite. Getting fit also has an indirect anti-inflammatory effect by burning fat which, as we’ve just learned, also secretes inflammatory molecules.

The benefits of exercise are so wide-ranging and systemic that doctors quip that if exercise were a drug, everyone would be queuing up to take it. Unfortunately, exercise is harder work than popping a pill, and our hectic lifestyles don’t always make it easy – but it really is worth taking the first step, even if you start small.
