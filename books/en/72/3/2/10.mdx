title: 10. Don’t bother with longevity drugs – yet
---




If you have a health condition, medication can literally keep you alive – and it’s obviously best to weigh up the costs and benefits of a particular treatment with your doctor – but, for people who are in generally good health for their age, there’s not yet a pill that can extend your healthy lifespan.

It’s sometimes suggested that we should all be taking a daily baby aspirin, which could theoretically be somewhat anti-ageing by reducing inflammation, and with it the odds of heart attack or stroke. Unfortunately, any dose of aspirin comes with a risk of stomach bleeding, meaning that you have to be at increased risk of heart attack before daily aspirin is worth taking on balance – and, even then, opinions differ within the medical profession as to whether the costs outweigh the benefits.

Diabetes drug metformin is a top contender to slow the ageing process; it’s one of the DR mimetics we discussed in Chapter 5. Though the evidence so far is promising, a large trial in the US will give us a clear answer one way or the other in the next five years or so – it’s probably best to just wait it out. (We’ll talk more about this trial in the next chapter.)

Another idea to watch is radical reduction of cholesterol levels, most likely with PCSK9 inhibitors, as we discussed in the previous chapter. Evidence so far suggests that humans can get away with far lower levels of cholesterol in our blood than is currently the norm and, if PCSK9 inhibition proves safe in the long run, these drugs (or the follow-up ‘cholesterol vaccine’ gene therapies) might be worth taking. However, more work is needed to establish that this is truly safe, especially in people without elevated cholesterol levels.

As some of the ideas we’ve discussed in the preceding chapters become reality, many people of different ages will be watching keenly, trying to work out if the current weight of evidence for a treatment means it’s worth taking. Coming up with mechanisms to allow us to make informed decisions about this is vital – and we’ll be exploring that in the next chapter, too.
