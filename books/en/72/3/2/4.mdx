title: 4. Get seven to eight hours of sleep a night
---




Getting seven or eight hours of good-quality sleep per night is probably optimal for health, but it’s hard to be totally sure because sleep is a very tricky thing to study. Large systematic reviews find that getting less than this is associated with an increased chance of death and – less widely publicised – that getting more than eight hours of sleep is associated with a larger increased risk of death than getting too little.

The challenge is working out whether this relatively robust finding suggests causality：are people sleeping 11 hours a night doing so out of choice, or is it more likely that they’ve got an underlying health problem which means they need the extra sleep? Is the short lifespan of people sleeping four hours a night because of a lack of rest, or because they live stressful lives which impact their health and also coincidentally reduce the time they have to sleep?

Short of enforcing sleep durations on people for decades in the name of science, the best answer to this question would be to identify biological mechanisms that could connect sleep and longevity. We met one suggestion for which evidence is growing in Chapter 5：while we sleep, our brains take the opportunity to spring clean, including flushing out the toxic amyloid which is implicated with Alzheimer’s disease. That’s a good incentive to try to stop a box-set binge one episode early and get a bit of extra shut-eye.

Sleep might also be one place where feedback processes can worsen the problems of ageing. Older people tend to sleep less well, while the healthiest older people have a stable sleep rhythm. If ageing worsens your sleep, which in turn worsens your health, this could make for a vicious cycle. One example is the clouding and discolouration of the lens of the eye resulting from protein modifications, the process behind the formation of cataracts. These tend to absorb blue light, making the world around us seem to take on warmer hues. We now know that our eyes use light levels, in particular levels of blue light, as a driver of our circadian rhythms. This is the logic behind ‘night mode’ on computers and phones which makes the screen dimmer and more orange in colour – bright blue light during the day tells our brain that it’s time to stay awake, and reducing exposure to blue in the evenings can therefore be beneficial for our sleeping patterns. Older people, with lenses tinted orange by protein degradation, are naturally exposed to less blue light regardless of time of day, undermining this subtle physiological cue. Sleep quality tends to improve after cataract surgery – removing the yellowed, cloudy lenses can restore not just our vision, but also our circadian clock’s blue cues.

Though the evidence isn’t yet totally watertight, getting a good night’s sleep may well improve your healthy lifespan – and make mornings more tolerable as a pleasant side effect.
