title: 7. Wear sunscreen
---




We mentioned in Chapter 4 that skin ageing is very closely related to its exposure to the sun. Sun-exposed skin wrinkles more rapidly, is at risk of developing the mottling and discolouration we associate with ageing and, less cosmetically, is at significantly higher risk of transforming into a skin cancer. Getting sunburn just once every two years is associated with increased cancer risk.

All of these phenomena are the responsibility of ultraviolet light present in sunlight. UV light has enough energy to break apart the chemical bonds holding molecules together – including proteins and DNA. Damage to DNA, if repaired incorrectly, can turn into a mutation and risks putting a cell on the path to becoming cancerous. Damage to proteins like collagen and elastin, which make our skin supple, can make it stiffer with age.

As a result, blocking UV from reaching your skin can stop the ageing effects of sunlight. You can do this by not going outside when the sun is particularly high in the sky, covering up exposed areas with clothing, or applying sunscreen which absorbs the ultraviolet light. Among a cornucopia of skin creams which claim to be ‘anti-ageing’, sunscreen has by far the best scientific evidence behind it.
