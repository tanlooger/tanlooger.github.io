title: 5. Get vaccinated and wash your hands
---




Vaccinations are one of the most important ways that humans have reduced mortality throughout our lives, and getting them doesn’t just protect you, but also those around you. Not only do they mean you’re likely to live longer because you won’t die of whatever infectious disease they prevent, they will also reduce your lifelong burden of inflammation, which can slow ageing, too.

If you’ve had all your childhood jabs, the most common vaccine that adults need is against seasonal flu. Many countries have an annual ‘flu season’, usually lasting a couple of months in the winter, though its length and severity can vary quite significantly from year to year as different strains of flu ebb and flow.

If you’re an older adult, getting a flu jab is well worth it. People aged 65 or over are ten times more likely to be hospitalised with flu, and around 20 times more likely to die of it than those aged 18 to 64. Just counting direct deaths from flu probably underestimates its true impact, especially in older people – deaths from heart attacks, strokes and diabetes also peak around flu season, and there’s evidence that flu is the trigger. Even though the vaccine gets less effective with age, the risks of flu are so dire that it’s worth getting. Giving precise numbers is difficult because flu vaccines are considered sufficiently effective that it would be unethical to purposely not vaccinate a subset of your older patients in studies.

Even in younger adults, the calculus is fairly clear because the flu jab is cheap, and has a decent chance of stopping you needing to spend a week wiped out in bed with fever, muscle ache and total exhaustion. The vaccine’s side effects are also fairly innocuous：it can cause mild flu-like symptoms, or a bit of aching at the site of injection. Throw in reduced inflammation and protection of any older relatives or people in your life who can’t get the vaccine, and there’s a pretty compelling case to get vaccinated however old you are.

It’s also worth following standard advice to avoid infections：wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, cook food thoroughly and take time off work if you’re unwell – this won’t just improve your colleagues’ healthy lifespans, but could have a much wider impact if it stops them passing the disease on to others, and so on. Of course, there could be no better example of the importance of basic hygiene and nipping transmission chains in the bud than the coronavirus pandemic.

It might even be worth avoiding infections to optimise your ageing more generally. There’s evidence that historical progress fighting infectious diseases in youth had additional, indirect effects on life expectancy, with children who faced fewer infections growing up being at less risk of diseases like cancer and heart disease in old age. The hypothesis is that the reduced burden of infection reduces the cumulative burden of inflammation, slowing the ageing process throughout life.

Infections can also directly cause seemingly unrelated diseases. In some cases the link is very clear, such as human papillomavirus (or HPV) causing cervical, mouth and throat cancers：HPV is now widely vaccinated against, primarily to reduce the risk of cancer rather than because the infection itself is particularly unpleasant. Another example is Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium which causes stomach ulcers and a substantial fraction of stomach cancers. There are also suggestive reports of bacteria and viruses being found in the plaques which clog our arteries in old age, and the brains of patients with dementia. Whether these bugs are the cause of these conditions, aggravate them, or are merely opportunistic or even innocent bystanders remains to be fully elucidated.

Overall, it’s probably worth taking reasonable measures to avoid infectious disease for benefits beyond avoiding the immediate misery of being ill.
