title: 1. Don’t smoke
---



Smoking is outrageously bad for you. If you want to live a long life in good health but you smoke, the first thing you should do is quit.

Those who smoke throughout their lives have their life expectancy slashed by around ten years. Smokers can’t even claim to live fast and die young：they experience about the same number of years in ill health at the end of life as non-smokers, meaning a greater fraction of their shorter lives overall. Smoking is responsible for 90 per cent of lung cancers and almost half of deaths from lung disease. And, while the lungs bear the brunt of the assault from cigarettes, there’s a reasonable case to be made that smoking basically accelerates the whole ageing process：it also increases the risk of many other cancers, plus other diseases of ageing like heart disease, stroke and dementia. It even makes you look older, causing thinning skin, wrinkles, hair greying and baldness.

Cigarette smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals which cause mutations in your DNA. They leave a specific ‘mutational signature’ in the DNA of cancers they cause – the lining of smokers’ lungs contains a lot of mutations where a C has transformed into an A, for example. This and other mutational signatures are found in tissues around smokers’ bodies because the chemicals are absorbed into your blood, allowing them to affect far more than just the lungs. These extra mutations give cancer many more rolls of the dice, causing the sequence of clonal expansions we discussed in Chapter 7 to proceed at a faster rate, and increasing the risk of the disease.

Smoking causes chronic inflammation, which is thought to be behind the smoking-related increase in cardiovascular disease. Remember that atherosclerotic plaques are mainly composed of dying immune cells – agitating the immune system accelerates their formation. Smoking also causes cellular senescence, shortens your telomeres and even increases the formation of AGEs (the advanced glycation end products that form when sugars react with proteins) in our tissues, in part because of highly reactive chemicals in cigarette smoke.

The good news is that quitting can fairly rapidly reduce your risk, or even return it to normal. Inflammation falls rapidly after giving up, and reaches normal levels around five years after stopping smoking, along with the risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, quitting can add years to your life：even stopping smoking at 60 will increase your life expectancy by about three years, while quitting at 30 pretty much restores your life expectancy to normal.
