title: 6. Take care of your teeth
---




You’ve probably been told one hundred times by your dentist：brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, clear out the gaps between your teeth with floss or interdental brushes, and avoid sugary snacks and soft drinks. What you might not know is that your dentist’s advice will affect more than just your smile and future dental bills – it can impact on your lifespan, and even your risk of dementia.

This first came to light in a series of studies in the 1980s and 1990s which sound like examples you’d use to illustrate the problems with observational studies. Epidemiologists noticed that people with tooth decay and gum problems were more likely to develop heart disease as they got older. This sounds like a classic case where correlation doesn’t imply causation：perhaps some people have less time and money to spend taking care of their diet, getting enough exercise and looking after their teeth; or maybe people who are less health-conscious generally both eat unhealthy food and don’t bother brushing their teeth afterwards. These explanations suggest that bad oral hygiene and heart problems would appear together, but with neither causing the other, both being caused instead by a third, unmeasured variable, like poverty.

However, this relationship seemed to hold up even as the statisticians tried to correct for these confounding factors. One study found that people who brushed their teeth twice a day were at lower risk of heart attack than those who brushed them once, who were in turn safer than those who didn’t regularly brush. They also showed a similar relationship for levels of C-reactive protein (the blood test for inflammation which is usually slightly raised in older people) – the more frequent brushers had less in their blood. This suggests a ‘dose–response’ relationship, where doing more of something (often taking more of a drug in a clinical trial) has a larger effect – and, while it doesn’t prove that poor dental hygiene causes heart attacks, it does make it more plausible. It’s also been shown that the types of bacteria present in your mouth can have an effect on both diabetes risk and life expectancy, even if they don’t give rise to levels of gum disease which would alarm your dentist.

The proposed biological link here is chronic inflammation. The ongoing battle with bacteria in your mouth that cause chronic gum disease, tooth decay and so on, even at low levels, results in a constant fizzing of inflammatory molecules. This, as is now our common refrain, basically accelerates the ageing process. In Chapter 5, we even met reported links between gum problems and Alzheimer’s disease, with bacteria responsible for gum disease being found in amyloid plaques. While these theories aren’t proven yet, it’s another good reason to keep your teeth clean.
