We are protein. Though DNA often seems to get all the press, it’s only the instruction manual. The instructions in DNA specify how to build proteins – molecules which are far more varied, far more complex, and do far more of the work.

The most immediate association of the word ‘protein’ is probably the nutritional information on the side of packets of food, but to imagine protein as an amorphous nutrient like a bag of sugar or block of fat does this cornucopia of chemicals an enormous disservice. Proteins are the most diverse, intricate and complex molecules we know of：they’re nature’s nanobots, tiny, tireless molecular machines which keep us alive, and they’re our cells’ and bodies’ scaffolding, the structural and mechanical building blocks which hold us together and allow us to move.
