title: 7. Signal failure

All around the body, our cells are constantly chatting, an endless exchange of molecular messages to the cells next door or on the other side of the body. This chemical telecommunications network has a huge impact on our physiology, from sex hormones, to sleep, to growth, to coordinating the immune system. All of these effects together are known as cell signalling – and, of course, as we age, they start to go off the rails.

Increasing dysfunction in signalling is part of the reason why ageing all seems to happen at once, after decades spent in broadly good health. Because these signals wash throughout our bodies, dispersed in our blood, they can synchronise detrimental effects across our tissues. Even worse, it’s a vicious circle – as our cells’ condition worsens, aggravated by aged signalling, so the chemicals they secrete worsen things further. This downward spiral contributes to the exponential increase in the risk of death at older ages.

One of the major changes in signalling in our ageing bodies is thanks to a process which will be a recurring character in this book, known as inflammation. Inflammation is our body’s first line of defence against infection and injury, which often results in the site of the problem swelling up. The inflammatory response is the molecular equivalent of sending up a distress flare, calling out to cells in our immune system to rush in and fight the invaders, or begin healing a wound. In youth, the normal process of inflammation is vitally important for ridding ourselves of infection and dealing with injuries. In old age, the inflammatory response can get itself stuck at too high a state of alert, known as ‘chronic inflammation’, that can in fact fuel the ageing process.

This process of gradually increasing inflammation as we get older is so ubiquitous that it’s been dubbed ‘inflammaging’. You can see it in blood test results：C-reactive protein, which doctors often measure to test whether you’ve got an infection, and interleukin-6, another molecule used to signal the immune system, are both known to increase with age. Not only that, but having high values of these inflammatory markers at a given age correlates with your risk of getting many of the diseases of ageing which we’re by now very familiar with – cancer, heart disease, dementia, and so on. It seems that most age-related changes are aggravated by inflammation one way or another.

The reasons for this gradual increase in inflammation are manifold. We’ve already discussed one source of this spiralling dysfunctional signalling：senescent cells, and their toxic SASP. Some components of the SASP are precisely these immune-rallying molecules which contribute to an overall state of heightened alertness, and the level of alarm increases with the steady accumulation of senescent cells with age. There’s also age-related damage, like the oxidised, glycated or otherwise broken proteins which we discussed：rather like with senescent cells, it’s the immune system’s job to clear up these damaged molecules. Eventually, as they become more numerous, there’s a constant low-level hum of cries for help throughout the body. There are also persistent infections which our bodies can keep under control, but never quite eradicate (more on those shortly) – again, this results in a constant, low-level background of immune hyperactivity, with detrimental results.

When it comes to signalling, there’s also an intimate relationship between our body’s response to food, and detrimental chemical messages associated with old age. This is known as ‘deregulated nutrient sensing’, because our bodies lose the ability to sense nutrients and respond to their presence appropriately, and the key experiments underpinning this are the DR studies that we met in the last chapter. Part of this is ‘insulin resistance’, which is the precursor to diabetes – when your body doesn’t respond properly to the hormone insulin, which tells cells to pull sugar out of the blood and store it for later use. We all now live in an environment with easy access to food or drink, including many options which are very sugary, meaning that many of us are at risk of developing diabetes,* especially as we get older. In people with insulin resistance or diabetes, insulin becomes ‘the hormone that cried “Wolf!” ’ and, even if more insulin is produced, its call to arms goes unheeded – the muscle, fat and liver cells that normally sequester sugar ignore the insulin signal and leave the sugar in the blood, where it can do damage.

However, diabetes isn’t just caused by an overfamiliarity with sugar and insulin – otherwise, unless we all developed a sweet tooth with age, why would it increase as we get older? We now know that insulin resistance and diabetes are also driven by inflammation. One piece of evidence connecting these is that patients with severe infections often develop rapid-onset insulin resistance and accompanying sky-high blood sugar due to the massive inflammatory response which is marshalled to fight them. In ageing, chronic inflammation causes a similar process in slow motion.

As well as inflammation and nutrient sensing, there are lots of other signals that go up and down in our bodies with time. They include other hormones like oxytocin, ‘growth factors’ that tell cells when to proliferate and build tissue and when to hold off, and messages in a bottle known as exosomes in which cells send little packages to both their neighbours and cells across the body. The wide-ranging changes in all these types of signalling with age means that these messenger molecules are central to the ageing process.
