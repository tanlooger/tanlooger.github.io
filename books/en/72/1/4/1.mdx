title: 1. Trouble in the double helix：DNA damage and mutations
---



Inside most cells of your body lie two metres of DNA, an instruction manual of six billion molecular letters – A, T, C and G, known as bases – which contains all the information needed to build you. Incredibly, in spite of its two-metre length, it’s squeezed into a nucleus just a few millionths of a metre across. DNA’s double-helix shape is the most famous molecular structure in the world. It adorns everything from biology textbooks to company logos, serving as a visual shorthand for ‘science’. But the platonic ideal of DNA, a pair of elegant intertwined spirals, a pure, pristine carrier of genetic information, belies the chaos in which it finds itself inside our bodies.

Crammed tightly into the nucleus, jostling with all kinds of other molecules, DNA is under a constant chemical assault which could damage its structure, or introduce typos into our genetic instructions. There are lots of ways DNA can be damaged. Perhaps the most obvious is external influences：toxins and carcinogens (the name given to anything which causes cancer) from food, cigarette smoke or nasty chemicals can inveigle their way into the nucleus and wreak havoc; UV in sunlight and radiation like X-rays or natural radioactivity can alter DNA, or even snap it in two. However, most of the damage is self-inflicted：chemical side effects of normal metabolism, the collection of processes through which food is turned into energy. It’s estimated that every cell in your body suffers up to 100,000 assaults on its genetic code every day.

On top of that, every time a cell divides this entire genetic code has to be duplicated. Thanks to the incomprehensible number of cells in your body and their fast rate of turnover, over your lifetime you’ll produce a couple of light years of DNA – enough to stretch halfway to the nearest star – in the form of ten quadrillion near-perfect copies of your two-metre personal genome. Even the highest-fidelity copying and proof-reading systems nature can devise will make occasional mistakes given that job spec.

Most forms of DNA damage are reversible because the cell can tell that something looks wrong and mend it – for example, there might be a molecule stuck to the DNA when it shouldn’t be, and your cell’s molecular machinery can chop it off. Perhaps the more troubling thing that can happen to DNA is that the repair process can go wrong, causing a mutation. Mutations change the information the DNA carries, altering the code of As, Ts, Cs and Gs which make it up, in a way which is indistinguishable from any other piece of DNA. Given the four molecular letters which make up DNA, a short piece of code could read GACGT. After a mutation, this might read GATGT instead, but there’s no way for the cell to ‘know’ that there’s anything wrong. That means that they can persist indefinitely, even if the code change is potentially harmful to the cell.

The most infamous consequence of accruing mutations is, of course, cancer. All it takes is a single cell to happen upon the wrong combination of alterations to its DNA, and the result can be an unlimited ability to proliferate which can allow it to grow into a tumour and ultimately be deadly. However, we also think that changes to cells’ DNA which don’t take them all the way to becoming a tumour can cause problems：typos in our cellular instruction manuals mean that cells don’t behave as they are supposed to. This means that mutated cells can become dysfunctional over time, or it can cause them to become more functional in ways that act to the detriment of the body as a whole, in so-called ‘clonal expansions’ which we’ll talk more about in Chapter 7.

One piece of evidence for the importance of DNA damage and mutations is that people who are successfully treated for cancer in youth often end up with what is basically accelerated ageing. The tragic and underappreciated shadow cast by our incredible successes bringing childhood cancers under control is an adulthood with increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, dementia, arthritis and even a higher likelihood of subsequent cancer, the end result of which is a reduction in life expectancy of about a decade. This is thought to be because many treatments for cancer work by damaging DNA. While chemotherapeutic drugs are carefully designed and radiotherapy’s X-ray beams carefully pointed to ensure that the tumour bears the brunt of the damage, other tissues are inevitably hit by these treatments, too. The effect is highly specific：women who receive radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast rather than the right tend to suffer from more severe heart disease, because the accidental dose of radiation to the heart is unavoidably higher in these cases. This suggests that DNA damage and mutations can directly accelerate the ageing of the heart – and implicates these processes in the broader phenomenon of ageing too.
