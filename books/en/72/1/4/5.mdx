title: 5. Accumulation of senescent cells
---




As you look in the mirror each morning, aside from the odd fresh pimple your face probably looks pretty much the same as it did the previous day. But your mirror is lying to you：our relatively constant external appearance from day to day belies a microscopic tumult under our skin, and throughout our bodies. The numbers sound terrifying – hundreds of billions of your cells die every day. Thankfully, you barely notice：firstly, you have a sum total of around 40 trillion cells, meaning the casualties number a tiny fraction of your total cell count; and secondly, the dying cells are constantly being replaced. This whole process is known as cell turnover, and its seamless operation is an essential part of life as a long-lived multicellular organism.

The cleanest end to a cell’s life is the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, that we met above. A suite of molecular checks and balances is always keeping an eye on how an individual cell is behaving and, if something looks wrong, initiates a tightly choreographed self-destruct cascade. The vast majority of frail cells do indeed do the decent thing for our bodies and die on cue, but some cells persist. They stick around, no longer dividing – aged, zombie cells which refuse to commit cell suicide, known as ‘senescent’ cells.

This state was discovered in 1961, by a young scientist called Leonard Hayflick. He noticed something strange when growing cells in a dish：older cells looked noticeably different from younger ones and seemed, after a certain point, to stop dividing. This phenomenon was christened ‘replicative senescence’ – the cells stop dividing because they’ve already divided too many times. The quantification of this phenomenon now bears Hayflick’s name：the number of times a cell can divide before becoming senescent is known as the Hayflick limit.

Hayflick’s experiments overturned half a century of dogma which held that cells were immortal outside the messy confines of the body. Thus, an obvious question arose：does the senescence of cells contribute to the senescence of the organisms which they make up? Do we get old because, after a certain number of divisions, our cells lose their capacity to proliferate?

Three decades after Hayflick’s work, we discovered that a hallmark we’ve already met – critically short telomeres – is the underlying cause of replicative senescence. We’ve also found that there are more reasons a cell can become senescent. One key driver is DNA damage and mutations – if there are enough pockmarks in a cell’s DNA, especially in particular genes which put the cell at risk of turning cancerous, senescence will apply the brakes. Cells can also turn senescent when put under chemical or biological stress, which could serve a similar purpose – stress can induce cellular damage which, again, can be the first step on the road to cancer.

Thus, cellular senescence exists as an anti-cancer mechanism. Given that cancer is a disease caused by cells which divide out of control, turning a pre-cancerous cell into a senescent one which can no longer divide is a safe way to extinguish the spark before it flares into a tumour. Got pre-cancerous mutations? Under potentially carcinogenic levels of stress? Or just divided suspiciously many times? Better to go senescent to be on the safe side. However, it’s not good enough to just sit there：as a senescent cell, you are no longer performing the function of a fresh, functioning cell in the tissue you find yourself in. So step two, having turned senescent, is to call for help.

Senescent cells do that by secreting inflammatory molecules which alert the immune system to their presence, asking to be removed. This means that an immune cell on search-and-destroy duty will be attracted over by the molecular ruckus and engulf the senescent cell, ridding your body of the problem. This molecular flag-waving is known as the SASP – the ‘senescence-associated secretory phenotype’ (secretory because the cells secrete these molecules, and phenotype is a biological term meaning an attribute or behaviour).

Perversely, it’s this calling for help which provides the means for these cells to cause such damage in our bodies. If the SASP does catch the attention of a passing immune cell and secures the senescent cell a hasty removal, all is well – but, if the senescent cell survives and keeps on pumping out inflammatory chemicals, this can effectively accelerate ageing throughout the body. Estimates of how many senescent cells there are in old animals suggest they are pretty few in number – only a few per cent of cells turn senescent, even in very old animals or people. This doesn’t seem enough to cause problems by directly compromising the function of tissues – but the SASP’s inflammatory molecules can allow a handful of cells to act as the proverbial few bad apples. Accordingly, it seems to take very few of these cells to cause problems：one study found that injecting just 500,000 senescent cells into young mice – around 0.01 per cent of their total cell count – was enough to cause physical impairment.

When we’re young, the smallish number of sporadic senescent cells generated all around the body are largely dealt with by the immune system. However, as you get older, various processes cause these cells to snowball in number. Firstly, the formation of senescent cells increases：as you age, your cells have divided more often, had time to accrue more DNA damage, and exist in the more stressed-out environment of an ageing body. Simultaneously, a weakening immune system is less able to find and eradicate the ballooning senescent cell population. In a final ironic twist, the SASP from existing senescent cells can actually breed more of them, in a deadly vicious circle.

The result of this snowballing is a heightened risk of many different diseases. Senescent cells are a smoking gun, often found loitering suspiciously near age-related diseases. A retinue of senescent cells accompanies tumours in cancer; heart disease, kidney disease and liver problems; the brains of people with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s; the painful, swollen joints of osteoarthritis; cataracts, which cloud the lenses of our eyes as we get older; and the age-related decline in muscle mass, known as sarcopenia.

The list of diseases where cellular senescence appears to play a part is long, and growing as biogerontologists take an increasing interest in these zombie cells. It seems there is a strong evolutionary trade-off at play：so deadly is the spectre of cancer to multicellular organisms that evolution is prepared to put us at risk of disease and deterioration in old age, just to be sure we won’t get cancer in youth. This is a classic case of antagonistic pleiotropy, and a strong contender for a cause of ageing：few and probably on balance helpful in the young, more and bad news in the old, and plausibly responsible for multiple diseases.
