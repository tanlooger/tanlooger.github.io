title: Fixing the hallmarks of ageing
---




We’ve now met ten hallmarks of ageing. Nothing in the body, from DNA to proteins to cells to whole systems of the body, is left unaffected by the ravages of time – which means we’ve taken a tour of much of biology. However, while you’d be forgiven for finding this list daunting, it’s actually incredible that it’s so short.

The human body contains something like one hundred organs, hundreds of different kinds of cell, and there are at least thousands of age-related diseases, depending on how you count all these things – and yet we can divide the villains behind ageing into just ten categories. This means that we could potentially address many, perhaps most of the changes and diseases we associate with ageing by devising a far smaller number of treatments than our current approach to medicine – targeting every disease separately – requires. And we can start doing so right now.

Rather than going after hundreds of types of cancer and finding bespoke treatments for each, we could try to deal with the DNA damage which underlies them all, the senescent cells and chronic inflammation which aggravate them all, and the faltering immune defences which they must all slip past, and reduce the odds of getting cancer in the first place.

You may have noticed throughout the list of hallmarks that I only discussed two of the three criteria for a hallmark of ageing：that it gets worse with age, and that accelerating it accelerates ageing. That’s because the next part of the book will look at how we can fix them. This isn’t just a hypothetical exercise：what’s most exciting is that ideas to tackle all of them are at various stages of development from the lab to human clinical trials.

Part Two will examine how humanity might turn the hallmarks into medicine, taking the first steps towards negligible senescence. We’ll survey the treatments we currently envisage, based on undoing each of these hallmarks, or making them irrelevant. It’s split into four chapters which will look at removing bad things that accumulate, renewing things which are broken or lost, repairing things which are damaged or out of kilter and, finally, reprogramming our biology to slow or reverse ageing.

Now that you know why we age, I want to show you how we can stop it.





*The spelling is because it was published in an American journal, Cell.

*Pronounced a-puh-toe-sis, with a silent second p, thanks to being derived from Greek – like pterodactyl.

*Specifically, type 2 diabetes, the form usually associated with ageing. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks the cells that produce insulin in the first place.

*The other main component of the adaptive immune system is B cells, which mature in the bone marrow. There’s also the ‘innate’ immune system, which comprises a range of generalist cells which can fight many different types of invader – including macrophages, which we’ll learn more about shortly. There’s not space to do justice to the kaleidoscopic diversity of the immune system, so T cells and macrophages will serve as our exemplars in this book.
