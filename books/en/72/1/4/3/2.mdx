title: Amyloids

In proteins, function follows form, and every protein’s unique, intricate structure allows it to turn its hand monomaniacally to one highly specific task. The way that proteins acquire their incredibly complex, precise shapes is by folding – a kind of molecular origami which starts out with a long chain and bends and shapes it into everything from sheets and spirals to precise molecular keys which will only fit in the very specific lock provided by another protein.

Unfortunately, the exquisite complexity of protein folding means that even the tiniest fumble in this process can cause a protein to fold in a totally different way. One particularly nasty type of misfolded protein is known as an amyloid. These misshapen molecules can clump together, glued by sticky sections exposed by their misfolding. If you get enough amyloids together in the same place, they can form structures known as ‘amyloid plaques’, which can strangle cells and tissues.

The most famous amyloids and amyloid plaques are those associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The ‘amyloid hypothesis’ suggests that a particular type of misfolded protein called amyloid beta is the prime mover in the disease, and that the molecular and cellular carnage which characterises the later stages is all set in motion by the conspicuous aggregates of amyloid beta which develop in the space between cells in the brain. After decades of study and the failure of a number of amyloid-clearing drugs to help Alzheimer’s patients, this ordering of events is now controversial and the amyloid hypothesis is coming under increasing pressure.

However, Alzheimer’s is far from the only disease where amyloids are found – the alpha-synuclein aggregates of Parkinson’s we just met are amyloids, too, and there are now dozens of diseases where amyloids are known to be implicated, from other brain diseases, to heart problems, to diabetes. These disease-associated amyloids are something which aren’t found in either young or older healthy brains and blood vessels, so we’re likely to need some anti-amyloid weapons in our anti-ageing arsenal.
