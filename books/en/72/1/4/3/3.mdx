Misfolding and aggregation into amyloid is one way a protein can go wrong. Another is for a protein to be made correctly, fold up fine, but then to have its structure modified afterwards in a problematic way. In many cases, such a modified protein would be broken down and recycled via autophagy. However, some proteins are not rapidly renewed and replaced – they can live for months, years, or sometimes even as long as we do, meaning that the proteins themselves can age.

One of the challenges of being alive is simple chemistry. Fuelling the many processes which keep our bodies ticking over requires us to have chemicals like sugars from our food, and the oxygen that reacts with it to release energy, floating about the place. No matter how cleanly you live, these highly reactive molecules are unavoidable, and they’re a danger to everything around them – not least to proteins. Sugars are very keen to glue themselves to proteins in a process called glycation, and oxygen can do the same in reactions known, logically enough, as oxidation – and these additions to proteins are collectively known as ‘adducts’.

You probably encounter glycation every day – it’s one of the most important reactions in cooking, thanks to a family of protein–sugar interactions known as the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is behind the crust on bread as it bakes in the oven, the seared surface of a pan-fried steak and the aromas, flavours and dark brown colour of roasted coffee. Unfortunately, the reactions which give rise to many of the most delicious flavours in food and drink are bad news for your body.

After a host of complex intermediate reactions, the final stage in the chemical bonding between proteins and sugars is known as an advanced glycation end product, or AGE. AGEs, along with proteins damaged by oxidation, are more or less irreversibly broken. Since the structure of proteins is so intimately related to their function, altering it by sticking sugars and oxygen on the side can impede them in their work, or change the way they interact with the proteins and cells around them.

This is mainly a problem for proteins which find themselves outside your cells, and glycation, AGE-ing or oxidation can affect different proteins in subtly different ways. Collagen, a structural protein with roles as diverse as skin flexibility and bone strength, can lose that strength and flexibility; the crystallin proteins which make up the lenses of your eyes can also become stiffer, making it harder to focus on nearby objects and meaning that almost everyone eventually needs glasses to read, and later for everything. Modifications to crystallins can also impact their transparency, leaving them clouded and ultimately causing age-related cataracts. Probably the most severe consequences come from stiffened blood vessel walls, thanks in part to modified collagen and another protein called elastin – this results in high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart failure, kidney disease and even dementia.

Since many of the modifications we’ve discussed are made of sugars, their formation is accelerated if there is more sugar around. This means that diabetes can increase their numbers and worsen their effects. We often think of diabetes as a disease of high blood sugar, but it’s the downstream consequences of sugary blood which are responsible for the worst side effects of the disease. Diabetics have significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke, massively increased risk of kidney failure, and suffer nerve damage which can result in loss of sensation in feet and legs – at its worst, it can even make patients unable to notice when they’re having a heart attack. Some of these symptoms are caused by glycation of proteins, bathed in a far higher concentration of sugar than normal at all times, and some is caused by the reaction of cells which aren’t evolved to function in such a sugary environment.

Together, slowed recycling, sticking together as amyloids and an accumulation of sugary and other modifications lead to problems with proteins that are responsible for many of the issues we experience as we age.
