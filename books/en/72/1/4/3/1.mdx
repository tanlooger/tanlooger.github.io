title: Autophagy

Many proteins have a short lifespan. An individual protein molecule, hard at work inside a cell, will typically last a few days. This might sound wasteful, the ultimate in throwaway living, but it’s actually a huge advantage when it comes to ageing, and bodily integrity in general. It’s because they’re so important that proteins are disposable：rather than investing valuable resources in making them indestructible, or devising ludicrously complex ways to fix thousands of molecules each of which can go wrong in uncountable ways, evolution has decided that it’s usually best just to bin the broken protein and make a new one. Our cells are masters of recycling, chopping up old or damaged proteins into pieces which can then be reused in the next round of protein production.

One of the key processes involved in recycling proteins is known as ‘autophagy’. Literally translating as ‘self-eating’, autophagy is a way that cells get rid of rubbish – mangled molecules and broken-down cellular components which are no longer working correctly – and recycle their ingredients to make fresh new versions. Its importance to our cells’ functioning was underlined by a Nobel Prize in 2016, awarded to Japanese scientist Yoshinori Ohsumi for his discoveries about how autophagy works.

Damaged cellular components, including many broken proteins, accumulate as we age, which is probably both a cause and an effect of a decline in autophagy with age. Reducing or entirely disabling autophagy in the lab can accelerate ageing in worms, flies and mice. We also think that it’s one of the mechanisms behind dietary restriction：disabling autophagy stops DR from extending lifespan, which suggests that it plays a key role. When food is scarce, autophagy frees up materials locked in existing proteins – with the added bonus that it tends to go after the broken stuff first, depleting damaged proteins and thus slowing ageing.

We also know that age-related diseases can be triggered by problems with autophagy. One example is Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative brain condition which causes sufferers to lose control of their movements：symptoms include rigidity, tremors and difficulty walking – and, in extreme cases, a total inability to move and wider symptoms of dementia such as difficulty thinking and emotional problems. Parkinson’s patients have a life expectancy of about a decade after diagnosis, eventually dying from a variety of problems caused by loss of control of their muscles.

The risk of Parkinson’s is increased if you have a mutation in a gene called GBA, which codes for one of the digestive enzymes involved in autophagy. Parkinson’s is accompanied by ‘Lewy bodies’, clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein that are toxic to brain cells. The problematic, sticky form of alpha-synuclein is normally degraded by autophagy, but even a small impairment caused by a minor GBA mutation is enough to slow its breakdown, increase its levels and thus increase the risk of getting Parkinson’s. Impaired autophagy is also associated with Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, arthritis and heart problems.

Thus, the failure of autophagy with age, its association with age-related diseases, and the fact that reducing or disabling it can cause diseases and stop life-extending interventions from working suggests that autophagy (and protein recycling in general) is an important part of the ageing process.
