title: 4. Epigenetic alterations
---




Epigenetics is the collective term for a biochemical zoo of molecular decorations sprinkled on the DNA inside cells. It is a chemical code of its own which sits above (hence ‘epi’) our genetics. Epigenetics unravels a seeming paradox in our biology：the cells of our body are almost ridiculously diverse, and yet almost all of them contain exactly the same DNA. Not only are there hundreds of different types of cells – skin cells, muscle cells, brain cells, and so on – but those cells need to do different things at different times to ensure that they are responding appropriately to cues from your body, the environment, and so on.

If your DNA is an instruction manual to build you, it’s a particularly well-thumbed one, covered in bookmarks, placeholders and notes scrawled in the margin. These epigenetic annotations tell the cell what to do with the DNA they’re attached to – whether, for example, to read a particular gene to be used in that cell at that time, or whether to ignore a whole section because it’s never going to be needed.

There are dozens of different types of epigenetic marks, but we’ll concentrate on one of the best-studied in the context of ageing：DNA methylation, meaning ‘methyl groups’ made of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms that stick to your DNA. It’s been known since the 1980s that DNA methylation tends to decrease overall with ageing, but it was only with the sequencing of the human genome in the late nineties and the development of special ‘chips’ which could measure methylation at tens or hundreds of thousands of locations across the genome that methylation could be understood in more detail. It turned out that our epigenetics knows how old we are even better than we do.

Steve Horvath, a mathematician-turned-biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, was fascinated to know if patterns of DNA methylation could be used to glean any insight into ageing. Unfortunately, very few people were specifically interested in epigenetics and ageing at the time, but Horvath had an ace up his sleeve：the long-standing culture in genomics of making data freely accessible. Thanks to methylation chips being cheap and readily available, there were thousands of epigenetic datasets available from studies looking at other things entirely. Horvath combed through these, grabbing those which fulfilled one simple criterion：that the experimenters had made a note of the age of the patient the methylation had been measured in.

This sounds ludicrous, even with hindsight. The 8,000 samples he used in his first paper came from wildly different studies, looking at everything from diet to autism, preeclampsia to cancer, from different labs with different protocols and practices, and from different places in the body：blood, kidney, muscle, more than thirty different tissues and cell types in all. How could you hope to find anything in this haystack of disparate data?

He sifted through tens of thousands of methylation sites, and found just 353 which, together, were sufficient to predict someone’s age. With this comparative handful of locations, the predictions were unnervingly accurate. The correlation between the predicted ‘epigenetic age’ and the actual age was 0.96 – where 0 would mean that they were totally unrelated, and 1 is perfect. This is off-the-charts performance：using telomere length to predict age, for example, scores less than 0.5. If you were to have your epigenetic age measured by Horvath’s methylation clock, it would probably differ from your chronological age by less than four years.

This level of performance was so outlandish that Horvath’s paper was rejected. The peer reviewers simply refused to believe that this ridiculous clock – built on a hotch-potch of data cobbled together from online databases, narrowed down to a tiny number of methylation sites – could possibly make such precise predictions in any tissue of the body. Horvath did eventually manage to get the paper published – though he later told a reporter that he had trouble believing the results himself until they were independently verified by other researchers.

The next step was to study people whose epigenetic age differs from their chronological age. Say you were actually 50 but your epigenetic age was 53, you’d be said to have an epigenetic ‘age acceleration’ of three years. Multiple studies have now shown that epigenetic age acceleration is bad news – people with an epigenetic age beyond their years die sooner. Happily, the converse is also true – it’s possible to be biologically younger than your calendar age, too, and thereby healthier and at less risk of death.

The morbid precision of epigenetic clocks either suggests that epigenetic changes are a cause of ageing, or at least that they are a window through which to understand how our bodies get biologically older with time.
