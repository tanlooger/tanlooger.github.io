title: 8. Gut reaction：changes in the microbiome
---




There are trillions of microorganisms – bacteria, fungi and viruses – living in and on you right now. These hitchhiking bugs are collectively known as our ‘microbiome’, and they live on our skin, in our mouths and, particularly, in our guts. The microbiome is a hot research topic at the moment because these microbes have turned out to be far more than just passive fellow travellers – they help with breaking down our food, work to keep us free of infection and even, fascinatingly, talk to and help out our immune system. Estimates of their numbers vary (not least with how recently you last went to the toilet – since most of them live in your large intestine, bowel movement can subtract as much as a third from your microbe population), but it’s thought that the number of microbial cells in your gut is approximately the same as the number of human cells in your body. Given their sheer quantity, it’s perhaps unsurprising that they can have a significant effect on your health.

One common theme of microbiome research is that there seems to be strength in diversity. A rich, varied population of gut flora is good news：when you’re young, a diverse family of microbes in your gut helps out with digesting certain components of food, overpowers invasive bacteria like those that cause food poisoning, and chats amiably with your immune system. As you get older, or if you have a chronic condition like irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, colon cancer or even dementia, your intestines can come to be dominated by fewer types of microbe, and often more aggressive ones. The direction of causality here isn’t entirely clear – it could be that the loss of diversity is driven by poor health or poor diet, or that a change for the worse in gut microbes impacts negatively on the rest of the body. Because this is biology, it’s quite likely to be a bit of both.

One mechanism by which a dysregulated microbiome is thought to affect the ageing process is by contributing to chronic inflammation. As diversity wanes and more aggressive microbes begin to take over, the immune system is put on high alert to keep these potentially infectious organisms in check. It’s also thought that the lining of our guts gets a bit leaky with age, driven by both other hallmarks of ageing taking their toll on the cells lining them, and the changing microbiome. These leaky intestines allow a few symbiotic microbes, microbial toxins or tiny pieces of food to cross into our bloodstream, which again causes a low-level thrum of immune activity, worsening inflammation.

As well as the ageing process itself, getting old is associated with other factors which drive changes in our microbiome. Our gut flora is heavily influenced by our diet, since the microbes effectively share what we eat. Older people’s diets often change significantly, sometimes for trivial-sounding reasons, like consuming less fruit because it gets harder to eat as we lose our teeth. This is a beautifully simple example of why it’s so important to treat the whole ageing process, and not do medicine in silos – better dentistry doesn’t just mean less toothache, but also has impacts on diet which have wider knock-on effects of their own. The elderly are also prescribed more antibiotics, which can wallop the microbiome at the same time as treating the bacteria making them ill. There’s also a significant environmental component to your microbial family, and older people living in care often have a different spectrum of species from those still living at home.

In spite of this complexity, we have managed to build ‘microbial clocks’ which, rather like the epigenetic clock we met recently, can determine someone’s age to within four years or so based on the relative proportions of different bugs in their guts. There’s also evidence from animal studies that the microbiome can be problematic in old age. One study took young and old mice without a microbiome of their own and placed them in cages with other mice, also either young or old. Mice living together exchange gut bacteria by ‘coprophagy’ – a scientific euphemism for eating one another’s poo – and the microbiome-free mice thus adopted their cage mates’ bugs. Those which ingested old-mouse microbes saw an increase in gut leakiness leading to raised levels of inflammation throughout their bodies, supporting the hypothesis that bad old bugs actively worsen health in old age.

As a hallmark of ageing, the microbiome is the most tentative on this list. There isn’t currently a huge literature on the microbiome’s effects with age, but studying our bodies’ microbial ecology is an emerging discipline so we shouldn’t expect to have all the answers yet. It’s also phenomenally complicated, involving a fast-paced ecosystem of thousands of species of bacteria, fungi and viruses interacting with one another, our diet and environment, intestines and immune system, meaning that working out the details could take a while. However, the meteoric rise of microbiome research over the last decade or so means we can expect to know a lot more about it, and its effects on ageing, in the next few years.
