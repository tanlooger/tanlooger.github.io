title: 2. Trimmed telomeres

If you know one thing about ageing biology it’s probably that it has something to do with telomeres. It does – but their story is a bit more complicated than how it’s often portrayed.

The tale of telomeres starts out deceptively simple. Our DNA is split into 46 lengths known as chromosomes (we get 23 from each parent). Telomeres are protective caps on our chromosomes, and their purpose is to solve two rather ridiculous evolutionary problems. Firstly, they stop the flailing ends of our chromosomes from being mistaken by overenthusiastic DNA repair machinery for loose pieces of broken DNA, and gluing them ‘back together’, creating unintentional chromosome spaghetti.

Secondly, even more absurdly, our DNA replication machinery can’t copy all the way to the end of a DNA molecule. You can imagine it like a builder who shuffles along the top of a long wall, building brick by brick as she goes – but, because she’s got to stand somewhere, she can’t lay the final bricks at the very end because she’d need to lay them under her own feet. This means that a small amount of DNA is lost from the end of a chromosome every time a cell divides. It would be untenable to lose important genetic information every time a cell divided – genes near the end of chromosomes would simply disappear, lopped unceremoniously off during DNA replication. Telomeres are evolution’s answer – just make the code at the end of chromosomes be something trivial whose loss will be no tragedy as far as the cell is concerned. Thus, our telomeres are made up of hundreds or thousands of repeats of a six-letter sequence, TTAGGG, TTAGGG, TTAGGG, as far as the eye can see. When some of the telomere is lost when DNA is duplicated during cell division, nothing terrible happens.

It won’t have escaped your notice that telomeres are a somewhat temporary reprieve from this problem. Losing a bit of DNA each time a cell divides isn’t an issue when you’ve got long, youthful telomeres to burn through but, as cells divide repeatedly and telomere length dwindles, so we get perilously close to truncating DNA that’s actually important. As a result, when telomeres become critically short, they send out alert signals which stop a cell from dividing. After too many divisions, a cell will either commit suicide via a process known as apoptosis,* or remain alive but stop dividing, in a state known as senescence (which we will return to shortly – senescent cells are another hallmark of ageing).

Every time a cell divides, around a hundred bases of DNA are lost. Cell division is an essential part of life for many of our tissues – for example, our skin constantly loses dead cells from its outer layers, and new skin cells divide afresh to replace them from beneath every few weeks – so our telomeres tend to shorten as we go through life. Telomere length is often measured in white blood cells, just because taking a blood sample is a simple procedure. A fresh white blood cell in a newborn baby might have telomeres which are 10,000 bases long (so about 1,700 TTAGGGs); by the time you’re in your thirties, this will drop to 7,500 bases; by your seventies, the average telomere could be below 5,000 bases in length. This process is known as telomere attrition.

Short telomeres are found along with many of the diseases and dysfunctions of ageing – they’ve been linked to diabetes, heart disease, some kinds of cancer, reduced immune function and lung problems. Telomeres are also implicated in the rather more superficial phenomenon of our hair turning grey as we get older. Stem cells in our hair follicles are responsible for producing melanocytes, the cells which produce the pigment melanin whose presence in varying quantities can make your hair anything from blonde to black. When the stem cells’ telomeres get too short, that means no more melanocytes can be produced, and the hair reverts to its ‘natural’ colour – pure white.

Short telomeres are also bad news for risk of death overall. A study looking at same-sex twins found that the twin with shorter telomeres was more likely to die first. The largest collection of telomere length data so far performed – looking at 64,637 Danish people – found that those with the longest telomeres were at 40 per cent less risk of death than those with the shortest, even after their age and other factors affecting their health were taken into account.

Finally, our cells keep an eye on their telomeres for reasons other than their dwindling length. Telomeres are unusually susceptible to DNA damage, and there’s emerging evidence that they act as a kind of canary in the coal mine for the rest of the genome – if a cell’s telomeres have taken heavy damage, it’s an indication that the rest of your DNA might be in a sorry state, too. Like telomeres that are critically short, damaged telomeres can signal to a cell that it’s time for apoptosis or senescence. This is especially relevant in places like the heart and brain where we think cells don’t replicate very often (or maybe at all) during our lifetime, meaning that their telomeres won’t get shorter thanks to cell division – but where damage to telomeres, gradually accrued throughout life, can have similar effects.

Thus, through their length and their condition, telomeres are indicators of the health and history of a cell, providing a running report on whether or not a cell is ageing well – and are therefore critical players in how we age.
