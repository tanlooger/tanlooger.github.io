title: 10. Defective defences：malfunction of the immune system
---




As we’ve just seen, the end result of everything from mutations to signalling problems is that our cells start to die or malfunction. The final stage in degeneration is the problems with organs and systems resulting from these failing component parts. From brain, to blood, to bones, to gut, every aspect of our physiology changes for the worse as we age. Many of these form vicious cycles, as we’ve already met with chronic inflammation：changing conditions in the body cause organs to work differently, often trying to compensate, which drives our bodies further from the relative stability they enjoyed in youth. One place where dysfunction and detrimental attempts at adaptation have particularly wide-ranging effects is the immune system.

The most obvious consequence of the immune system’s reduced effectiveness in old age is that it is less able to defend us from infectious disease. This loss of defensive capabilities is clear from the statistics：considering the billion and a bit people who live in high-income countries, where vaccines and antibiotics are widely available, infectious disease is still responsible for a significant 6 per cent of deaths. Our huge success with hygiene and modern medicine hasn’t entirely eradicated the burden of infectious disease, but postponed it.

By alleviating mortality in childhood and young adults, many of us now live long enough to experience the immune decline of ageing, and more than 90 per cent of deaths from infectious disease are in people over the age of 60. The substantial extra risk to older people from infectious disease has been laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic, whose toll in terms of hospitalisation and death is much higher among the elderly. While dying from flu or COVID-19 isn’t ageing per se, the massively increased risk with age means that ageing bears ultimate responsibility for most of these deaths.

What’s worse is that a key tool of modern medicine – vaccination – is less effective in the elderly because vaccines rely on the failing immune system for their effectiveness. By effectively giving immune cells a sneak preview of a potential disease, vaccines allow them to learn what to look out for. Unfortunately, as the immune system ages, our response to vaccines weakens, too. This doesn’t mean it’s not worth getting your annual flu jab if you’re getting older – quite the opposite：because your risk of serious complications or death from flu is so much greater than when you were young, the overall protective effect of the vaccine is greater, in spite of a reduced immune response. (If you’re young it’s probably worth getting one anyway because flu is really quite a nasty disease – plus it will help to protect your older friends and relatives.)

Some of the reasons for this immune decline are other hallmarks of ageing that we’ve already met. One key process is cell loss in a small organ called the thymus, which is found just behind your breastbone and in front of your heart. The thymus is the training ground for T cells (indeed, their thymic origins lend them their name), one of the two key types of immune cell which form the ‘adaptive’ part of our immune system which is able to adapt to fight new threats.* The adaptive immune system can also learn – once it’s fought off a particular threat, the victorious T cells can transform into ‘memory T cells’, ready to ride again should the same germs return. Given how useful T cells are, it may come as a surprise to learn that your T cell academy is already mostly gone, unless you are reading this book at quite a precocious age. The thymus peaks in size at age one, and it’s all downhill from there, halving in volume every 15 years or so – it’s half gone by your teens, 75 per cent gone by the age of 30, and barely any remains after the age of 60 or so. This disappearing act is known as ‘thymic involution’, and it takes the form of previously functional thymic tissue turning into fat.

Though it might seem ridiculous, this process actually appears to be intentional. The evolutionary rationale for destroying your own defences is that producing new T cells is expensive – and, as we know, it’s often better to put energy towards reproduction rather than ensuring your own survival into old age. If you were a human living in prehistory, probably in a small group, unable to move further than your clan could roam, it’s likely that you’ll have seen most of the germs you’ll ever need to battle by the time you’re 20. This means you can save a lot of energy by producing fewer new recruits as time goes on, relying more on your memory T cells to keep you safe. It’s a classic case of antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theory, where freeing up resources to reproduce in early adulthood ends up costing us in late life – particularly today, as we now live decades longer in a highly connected world with constant exposure to new infections.

Memory T cells can stick around for decades and, if their old foe returns, they’re the most highly proliferative cells in the body：a handful of memory cells can expand to form a clone army of millions. This puts the cells themselves under incredible strain – DNA damage and shortened telomeres from dividing many times can lead to cellular damage and senescence of the immune cells, which weakens our immune defences.

The immune system also suffers its own peculiar forms of ageing. The strangest is that the immune system can be aged by the very infections it fights：persistent bugs can lead to an immune obsessiveness which undermines its ability to face down new threats. Chief among these is cytomegalovirus, or CMV, a relative of genital herpes and chickenpox. The majority of people catch CMV at some point during their lifetime, and those infected never quite shake it off. As we age, T cells specialised in dealing with CMV can come to occupy up to a third of our ‘immune memory’, leaving less ‘storage space’ to learn how to deal with new infections.

And, though the immune system is most famous for seeing off external threats, it also has crucial roles to play in keeping internal ones under control. We’ve already seen how the immune system seeks and destroys senescent cells, and that its dysfunction in old age could be both a cause of their rise in numbers and exacerbated by their contribution to chronic inflammation. Immune cells are also on the lookout for cancer – trying to catch cells which are putting together the toolbox of genetic changes needed to form a tumour, but have nonetheless escaped senescence or apoptosis. Cancer’s higher occurrence in old age is in part down to the immune system’s decline：as its function declines with age, nascent tumours get more time to grow unchecked.

Another age-related problem which can trace its origins to the immune system is one you might not expect – heart disease. We hear so much about cholesterol and heart disease that you might imagine that our arteries are blocked with greasy deposits of cholesterol itself, but things are actually more complicated than that. The ‘plaques’ responsible for heart attacks and much more besides aren’t just streaks of lard, but graveyards of immune cells which died after becoming engorged with cholesterol. This process is known as atherosclerosis.

Cholesterol tends to get a pretty bad rap, because having too much of it in your blood can put you at risk of heart disease. In spite of this, it’s actually an essential molecule in the body used, among other things, for building cell membranes – the bag which holds the contents of a cell together. The problem is that cholesterol often gets stuck in the arterial wall and starts a chain of events which can go on to kill you.

A plaque usually starts off with a small, innocuous injury. The alarm is raised, and immune cells in the blood rush to the rescue, engulfing whatever is causing the problem to make space for repairs to begin. Often, that’s cholesterol. At first, the ‘macrophages’ (literally ‘big eaters’, a type of unfussy bad-stuff-gobbling immune cell) are quite effective at clearing up cholesterol. Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t take much for them to become overwhelmed with more cholesterol than they can deal with. Worse, cholesterol can react with oxygen and sugars, just like the oxidised and AGE-d proteins we met, and macrophages can’t deal with these modified versions. This means that they start to hoard rather than discard cholesterol, collecting it in fatty globs called lipid droplets.

This is stage one of atherosclerosis. The engorged, dysfunctional macrophages look foamy under the microscope, earning them the name ‘foam cells’. Eventually, the foam party can overwhelm the macrophages, which results in them committing cell suicide. Guess what comes to clear up? More macrophages.

Of course, since the debris and dead cells include the same damaged cholesterol which finished off the previous macrophages, the new clean-up squad doesn’t really stand a chance. As a result, they can die, too, setting up a vicious cycle. As more macrophages turn up and die, leaving an ever-larger pool of damaged cholesterol and dead cells, what was a microscopic injury becomes visible inside the artery as a ‘fatty streak’.

Our first fatty streaks appear in our arteries as children or teenagers, but it’s usually decades before any of them reach the point where they pose a serious threat. Many years in the making, a fully-fledged atherosclerotic plaque is an incredibly complex structure：at its core is a huge mass of dead macrophages and cholesterol, held in place by other types of cells which try to keep a literal lid on things.

This huge mass creates a bulge in the arterial wall which can narrow its interior, reducing blood flow. This is bad in itself, but usually doesn’t cause an issue until almost the whole blood vessel is blocked. If that does happen, and it’s a particularly critical vessel, it can cause serious problems – a blockage in one of the arteries supplying the heart, for example, can significantly reduce its supply of oxygen and lead to chest pains and shortness of breath. Nowhere in the body is safe from this narrowing：atherosclerotic plaques narrowing the arteries which supply the penis with blood can cause erectile dysfunction, by disrupting the surge of blood needed to get and maintain an erection.

The worst-case scenario is if the plaque ruptures：this causes it to spill its semi-solid contents into the bloodstream, where they can rapidly move through the body, jamming up smaller vessels entirely. If this happens in an artery supplying the heart, it will cause a heart attack – a total loss of oxygen to a part of the heart muscle. This will often be accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath and a (justified) feeling of overwhelming dread. As is probably obvious, the victim should be rushed straight to hospital; if the blockage is dislodged quickly enough, some of the affected section of heart muscle may be saved. The damage will almost certainly leave the heart weaker and, given the extremely slow turnover of heart muscle cells we mentioned, it is unlikely to ever fully heal.

Another particularly bad place for a chunk of plaque to end up is the brain. A blocked vessel here causes an ‘ischaemic’ stroke – a stroke resulting from a loss of oxygen to part of the brain tissue. If the blocked vessel is a big-ish one, this can cause immediate consequences such as weakness in face or arm muscles, loss of the ability to speak, blurred vision or dizziness; anyone with these signs should get to a hospital as quickly as possible. If it’s a smaller vessel, then the consequences may be minor enough to go unnoticed but, over a few years or a decade, dozens of mini-strokes can accumulate to reduce brainpower and memory overall, in a condition known as vascular dementia. Stroke is a huge killer, responsible for around 10 per cent of deaths globally. Even if it doesn’t kill you, a stroke can leave you disabled, with difficulty moving, speaking and understanding, or partially blind. Vascular dementia, too, is a serious and widespread condition – the less infamous cousin of Alzheimer’s is the second most common form of dementia, responsible for about 20 per cent of cases.

Our immune system’s inability to deal with damaged cholesterol as it clears up debris in our blood vessel walls has a lot to answer for：depending on where you are in the world, the heart attacks and strokes caused by atherosclerotic plaques are behind something like one in five deaths. It’s incredible that this single, obscure seeming drama in our arteries is competing with cancer for the title of deadliest process in human biology.
