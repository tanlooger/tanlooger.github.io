title: 6. Power struggle：malfunctioning mitochondria
---




Inside our cells roam herds of thousands of tiny semi-autonomous beasts called mitochondria. They are how cells make their energy, and thus they’re often described as ‘the powerhouse of the cell’ – so often, in fact, that it’s not just a cliché, but it’s even slightly hackneyed to point out that it is one. Given the centrality of energy to the process of living, it’s probably little surprise that mitochondria are implicated in the process of ageing, too.

Mitochondria are extremely odd. They’re often portrayed as a population of largely independent, bean-shaped objects – but things are more complicated than that. We now know that they frequently undergo ‘fusion’ and ‘fission’ events, joining together in anything from small teams to, occasionally, a single megamitochondrion which hangs like a cobweb around a cell’s interior, and at other times break apart to go their separate ways. They’re also the only part of your cell outside the nucleus to have their own DNA, stored in up to ten separate circular chromosomes per mitochondrion.

Mitochondria change quite substantially with age. There tend to be fewer of them in older animals’ cells, and those mitochondria produce less energy. This reduction in mitochondrial number is related to risk of illness and death：people with the least mitochondrial DNA in their cells (which is used as a proxy for the number of mitochondria) are more likely to be frail and 50 per cent more likely to die than those with the most. Just like the DNA in our cell nucleus, mutations in mitochondrial DNA increase with age in both animals and humans. There’s also a mitochondria-specific type of autophagy known, logically enough, as ‘mitophagy’ and, guess what? It declines with age, meaning that messed-up mitochondria accumulate.

In terms of specific age-related diseases, mitochondrial fingerprints are found in parts of the body where energy expenditure is high. Muscles are one tissue which burns through loads of calories：damage to mitochondria is part of the process which leads to the loss of muscle mass and strength as we get older. They’re also critical in the brain：in spite of making up just 2 per cent of our bodyweight, our brains consume around 20 per cent of our energy. That means its mitochondria are always running at full power and, accordingly, dysfunctional mitochondria show up in diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

In the lab, mice have been bred with particular mitochondrial defects which cause changes that seem, superficially at least, like accelerated ageing. In ‘mitochondrial mutator’ mice, a gene needed to copy mitochondrial DNA has been altered such that it no longer performs ‘proof-reading’ – meaning it doesn’t check that the copy it’s made is correct, and the mice accumulate lots of mutations in their mitochondrial DNA. They experience premature hair greying and hair loss, hearing loss, heart problems, and reduced lifespan. Another experiment bred mice with a mutation which reduced mitochondrial numbers, and could be turned on and off by giving the mice a drug and later withdrawing it. Activating the mutation by giving the mice the drug caused them to develop thickened, wrinkled skin, hair loss and lethargy, rather like old mice; stopping the drug and giving the mice a few weeks to recover caused their wrinkles to fade and restored their fur to a condition indistinguishable from their littermates without the mutation.

The first theory to specifically implicate mitochondria in the ageing process was the mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing. Because mitochondria generate energy, they are forever dealing with highly reactive chemicals, particularly oxygen. If a mitochondrion slightly fumbles the incredibly complex chemistry behind producing power safely, it can create a ‘free radical’ – a highly reactive chemical which can go on to cause chaos in the cell, damaging proteins, DNA, and any other critical molecules it comes across. Three of the most biologically important free radicals are OH, NO and ONOO⁻：with names like that, surely these are prime suspects in causing cellular damage.

We now know that the simple idea of mitochondrial free radicals as biochemical berserkers which accelerate ageing is an oversimplification. If ageing was down to mismanaged free radicals, the killer experiment would be to increase animals’ inbuilt defences against them and watch as lifespans lengthened. Mice genetically engineered to have extra copies of anti-free-radical genes live no longer than normal mice. Worse, doing the opposite makes no difference either：an experiment in worms deleted all five of their anti-free-radical genes, called sod genes, and the worms suffered from massively increased free radical damage, but their lifespans were unaffected.

Recent studies have uncovered that free radicals are part of the extensive molecular vocabulary that cells use to communicate, and to regulate behaviour. They tell cells when to grow, when to stop, and orchestrate processes like apoptosis and cellular senescence. Immune cells use them as weapons, overwhelming invading bacteria with an onslaught of free radical damage. Life has been dealing with free radicals for literally billions of years：with hindsight, it’s obviously simplistic to assume that evolution would leave our cells at their mercy.

This new, more nuanced understanding of free radicals doesn’t let them off the hook entirely：they still can damage our essential biological molecules, and it seems unlikely that this has literally no effect. Mitochondria are central to processes from cell growth to cell death and, as we’ve seen, mitochondrial behaviour changes with age. Thus, mitochondria are key players in the ageing process.
