title: 9. Cellular exhaustion
---




It’s probably no surprise that, besieged by the hallmarks of ageing we’ve met so far, we start to lose cells in our body as we age, and those that survive become worn out and less able to do their jobs properly. The catch-all name for these processes is cellular exhaustion, and it affects many of the populations of cells in tissues and organs across the body.

Stem cells are the type of cell whose exhaustion is most often discussed – because it’s their job to replenish when cells wear out, so if they themselves become exhausted, that’s bad news. Stem cells have particular importance in places where cell turnover is high. For example, haematopoietic stem cells (a bit of a mouthful, so let’s call them HSCs) reside in our bone marrow and work tirelessly to renew the various cells which make up our blood. Together, they are responsible for producing 200 billion oxygen-carrying red blood cells, plus billions more immune cells and platelets (which are used in blood clotting), every single day.

As we age, HSCs become less effective at replenishing our blood cells. This is down to a number of the hallmarks we’ve already discussed, including DNA damage and mutations, epigenetic changes, problems with autophagy and changes to signalling from cells in their environment. The irony is that all of these changes actually increase the number of HSCs overall – in part because these factors bias them slightly towards dividing to make two stem cells, thus increasing their own population, rather than into a stem cell and a blood cell precursor.

As well as producing too many stem cells and not enough of the type of cells they’re meant to top up, stem cells can produce the wrong ratio of cell types with age, too. One example of this is mesenchymal stem cells (another mouthful – let’s call them MSCs). These are a group of stem cells whose progeny include bone-building osteoblast cells, tissue-joining cartilage cells, muscle cells and a type of fat cell found in bone marrow. As we age, MSCs lose their taste for forming bone-builders, while increasing their preference for becoming fat cells. This means that our bone marrow has less of the strength-giving matrix of proteins and minerals which osteoblasts deposit, and more fat. Fattier bones are weaker, and this process contributes to osteoporosis – the age-related weakening of bones which is particularly acute in women after the menopause. This weakens our skeletons, which is a problem often without obvious signs until you end up in hospital with a serious fracture. It can also result in many tiny fractures which go unnoticed – repeated ‘compression fractures’ crushing the bones of the spine are one of the reasons we get shorter with age. That means that problems ranging in severity from millions of broken hips to countless lost centimetres of height can be partly blamed on a change of preference among a particular kind of stem cells.

The decreasing effectiveness of stem cells has wide-ranging effects throughout the body. Another thing we can chalk up to it is the reduction in our senses of smell and taste as we get older. Odours are picked up by a specialised group of brain cells called olfactory receptor neurons which protrude into a part of the roof of the nasal cavity. Tiny hair-like structures covered in receptors sample the molecules drifting into our noses, and send signals to our brain with news of what they’ve detected. Since they have to be in contact with the outside world in order to function, they inhabit an unusually traumatic environment for a neuron, under siege by environmental toxins and microbes rather than safely shielded inside the skull. Consequently, they die relatively frequently and rely on stem cells to replace them. Olfactory neuron stem cells start to flag as we get older – more of them sit idle and, unlike HSCs, they seem to develop a preference for dividing into non-stem-cell daughters, meaning that the pool of replenishers shrinks. Thus, as smells fade and food no longer tastes quite like it used to, the wearing out of stem cells is responsible.

Though stem cells are the group whose exhaustion is most often considered, ageing is also evident in tissues which don’t rapidly replace their cells. Tissues like the blood, skin and intestines are known as ‘renewal tissues’ because they’re constantly renewing. Where an intestinal stem cell might divide once a week, stem cells in the liver do so once a year. Some tissues, such as heart muscle and many parts of the brain, may not renew at all. This is why, when heart cells die after a heart attack or brain cells are lost after a stroke, the damage is often permanent.

It’s via this subtly different mechanism that another sense is blighted by cell loss in old age：hearing. We hear when sound is channelled down our ear canals to our inner ears, where tiny hair cells detect the vibrations and send signals to our brains about what kind of sound it is. Unfortunately, loud sounds, toxins and simply growing older can all damage these hair cells, and we can’t replace them. Older people particularly lose the ability to hear high notes, and general loss of sensitivity at all frequencies reduces the ability to clearly distinguish sounds and understand speech.

This is a blight on the lives of the elderly – the inability to hear is everything from socially isolating (imagine being unable to hear what everyone around the dinner table is saying) to outright dangerous (imagine crossing the road while being unable to hear the traffic). Cell loss without replacement is responsible. It also has an indirect effect, with the loss of sensory stimulation putting people with hearing loss at greater risk of dementia. Our current treatments are also textbook examples of attempting to plaster over the problem rather than treating the underlying cause：hearing aids simply make sounds louder, allowing atrophied ears to make them out. Unfortunately, the indiscriminate amplification of a hearing aid doesn’t have the finesse of our meticulously evolved aural system, meaning it can often be hard to do things like pick out an individual voice in a noisy environment when using them.

Thus, the loss either in numbers or effectiveness of stem and other types of cell around our body is responsible for some of the slow decline of ageing, and some specific diseases. This is likely to be driven by many of the hallmarks we’ve already discussed, but it’s a major enough issue to warrant a hallmark of its own.
