title: The worm has turned 150
---




One of the most important stories in ageing biology starts in a rather inauspicious location：a compost heap in Bristol, UK, in 1951. Wiggling through the dirt was a population of nematode worms, which are arguably biogerontology’s most historically significant organism, responsible for transforming the field into a serious scientific discipline. Without those West Country worms, we could well be decades behind where we are today.

A decade after their composty beginnings, biologist and later Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner was looking for an animal in which to study neural development which was simple enough to have a hope of understanding it. His first experiments were done with a type of nematode which he found in the soil in his back garden in Cambridge and he named them N1 – nematode 1. However, he was eager to find the best worm for the job, and wanted to audition other candidates before proceeding. The Bristolian worms were the eventual winners, and they were christened N2, which is less of a mouthful than their full biological name, Caenorhabditis elegans (or C. elegans for short). These nematodes, tiny, millimetre-long worms, transparent, unassuming, and barely visible to the naked eye, are now one of the most successful ‘model organisms’ on the planet.

Model organisms are one of the key tools in modern biology. These are creatures which are used as testing grounds for everything from drugs to blue-skies biological theories. The idea of using a model organism is to simplify a problem, both conceptually and experimentally, and allow us to glean insights which can then be used in more difficult, complex organisms like humans. The classic quartet in ageing biology (and many other fields, too) is yeast, worms, fruit flies and mice, in ascending order of biological similarity to us.

The key difference between these nematode worms and mice or people is the obvious one：it’s a vastly smaller animal. Comprising just under a thousand cells rather than trillions, their bodies are small enough that we can get a handle on the behaviour of every single cell. There’s even a project called OpenWorm trying to build a full cell-level computer simulation of C. elegans – something we can only dream of doing for humans for now.

The experimental advantages are also significant. C. elegans comes to the rescue when human studies would be too inconvenient, too lengthy, or just an ethical nightmare. These worms grow up, reproduce and die in just a couple of weeks, massively speeding up experiments, you can grow dozens of them in identical conditions in a small dish in the lab – a set-up which humans tend to object to – and we also have fewer qualms with worms when it comes to genetically modifying them just to see what happens.

The first worm experiments sound haphazard and primitive compared to modern science, with its precision gene-editing and sequencing. The old technique was to take some N2 worms (N2 is still used to refer to the ‘standard’ strain, the HB pencil of C. elegans varieties) and expose them to a nasty chemical which induces random mutations in their DNA; take the thousands of mutated eggs they produce and grow them each individually into adults; breed dozens of identical copies from each one; and finally, check to see if any of your randomly mutated worms do anything interesting – in this case, watch them for a few weeks to see how long they live. If one of these mutants lives longer than normal, then whatever changes lie in their DNA might help us to understand the genetic basis of longevity.

In 1983, scientist Michael Klass was starting to lose faith in this protocol, after several years testing a staggering eight thousand strains for longevity mutants. He had discovered just eight which lived longer than normal, and found reasons to dismiss all of them as uninteresting：two spontaneously went into a worm-specific form of suspended animation called the dauer* state, which is probably cheating (even if humans could do something similar, living longer by spending decades in a strange environmentally hardened cuticle probably isn’t what most people have in mind); one had a defect which seemed to stop it sensing and moving towards food; and the other five all appeared lethargic under the microscope. Klass suspected that these latter six strains, through either a sense of smell failure or general lethargy, were eating less than their N2 counterparts. It was by now common knowledge that eating less makes animals live longer – so all he’d done was rediscover dietary restriction via an incredibly laborious and roundabout genetic route.

Klass’s failure to identify a longevity mutant fitted right in with the prejudices of the time：ageing, as we’ve seen, is down to many different genes which have terrible effects in late life and accumulate in our DNA either by chance, or because they conferred an advantage in youth. It was thought that there must be dozens or even hundreds of such genes, each whittling away at an old organism’s life chances – if one single longevity gene could make any difference, why wouldn’t evolution just turn it up to eleven and marvel at its long-lived creations? And wouldn’t we expect to see occasional mutant people who live far longer than the rest of us?

Klass’s results seemed to confirm this thinking：mutating a few genes in a worm couldn’t extend its life, other than by the back-door route of depriving it of food. He ended up quitting academic science in frustration, but his colleague Tom Johnson took up the quest with remarkable tenacity. Johnson was hoping that the worms’ life extension was real, and that he could use it to double down on the existing dogma and prove that ageing was controlled by many different genes. He knew that these mutation-inducing chemicals typically introduced about twenty errors in each worm’s DNA, so it was quite possible that the long-lived worms possessed a string of genetic alterations, some positive, some negative, and all ripe for investigation.

Step one was to work out if the worms’ impaired feeding was important. He started by breeding the mutants with N2 worms, the first step of a painstaking process to isolate the genes responsible in the days before genome sequencing. He managed to produce some worms which ate as much as normal, but still had long lifespans. DR ruled out, he bred some of these long-lived and well-fed worms with N2s. To his astonishment, the worm-children produced by this union had normal lifespans.

The simplest explanation for this observation was that a single gene was responsible for the life-extension observed.* If there were many genes involved, it was highly unlikely that the entire effect would vanish in the first generation – you’d expect the lifespan of the cross-bred worms to be somewhere in between N2 and the long-lived mutants. Then, breeding the long-lived mutants with each other didn’t enhance lifespan further – suggesting that they all shared either the same or a very similar genetic mutation.

Eventually, Johnson convinced himself that it was indeed a single gene responsible for the long lives of these worms. He published his findings in 1988, naming the gene age-1. Its effects were impressive – the worms’ lifespans were increased by 50 per cent, from two weeks to three. That’s equivalent to finding a single mutation which means humans could habitually live to 120 rather than 80.

Unfortunately, he failed singularly to convince the rest of the biology community. Many biologists thought the work could be erroneous or, if not, just a weird quirk of nematodes with limited relevance to other species. Even were it true, there was cause to doubt its deeper significance – the age-1 mutants were not only long-lived, but also had substantially decreased fertility. Far from casting doubt on the evolutionary theories of ageing, Johnson had just confirmed them with a perfect example of disposable soma theory – a single gene which extended life, but by redirecting resources from reproduction to somatic maintenance.

Though it didn’t cause fireworks at first, discovering age-1 did light a fuse. It inspired another worm biologist, Cynthia Kenyon, to go out searching for more longevity genes. In 1993, she found another longevity mutation, this time in a gene called daf-2 which was already well known to worm biologists – it was discovered in another of those random mutation experiments, and worms with daf-2 mutations were especially eager to enter the long-lived dauer state. Kenyon’s experiments showed that, if raised at a cool temperature to stop them from becoming dauers, these worms lived longer than normal worms：whatever mechanisms allowed dauers to tough it out for months awaiting more favourable conditions work in adult worms, too, extending their lifespan. And the results were spectacular：daf-2 mutants lived twice as long as normal worms.

Further work on age-1 and daf-2 mutants showed that they really were delaying the ageing process. While two-week-old N2s spend their final days looking haggard and barely moving, their longevity mutant contemporaries look youthful and fresh, and slither around rapidly. Late-life decrepitude – which is so severe as to be visible to the untrained eye through a microscope, even in these unfamiliar creatures – didn’t kick in until shortly before their own demise, a couple of weeks later. These mutations don’t just extend life – they slow down the ageing process itself.

Where age-1 could be dismissed as a quirk of worm biology, a second gene with a plausible mechanism of action and an even more impressive boost to worm lifespan did a lot to dispel these doubts. The scientific importance of this discovery is obvious：DR experiments had already shown that ageing could be manipulated, but to alter it by changing a single gene is astounding. How could just one gene have such a dramatic effect, seemingly across the whole spectrum of age-related changes?

But perhaps the bigger effect was cultural. This finding opened up the study of ageing to the precision techniques of modern genetics and molecular biology. No longer was ageing a process so messy that it couldn’t be studied – if you can control it with pinpoint alterations to single genes, then the process was suddenly open to the kind of methodical tinkering which might allow scientists to decode it. This discovery was a landmark, showing that ageing was not just malleable, but also intelligible. Ageing research, formerly viewed as a scientific dead end, now took to the limelight. The modern scientific investigation of ageing was born.

The story of age-1 and daf-2 doesn’t end there. A gold rush of worm genetics uncovered many more mutants which affected ageing. The record for longest-lived worms was repeatedly smashed by worms carrying different mutations in different genes. With poetic symmetry, the current reigning champion is age-1 – the same gene, but a different mutation to the original eighties Klassics. Worms carrying it live for an average of 150 days – a jaw-dropping tenfold life extension over N2 worms. In the end, the confirmatory experiment lasted almost nine months, with the final age-1 (mg44) worm dying after 270 days. While arguably a slightly facile comparison, that’s roughly equivalent to a human living 1,500 years.

And because this experiment was performed in the mid-2000s – well into the era of DNA sequencing – we now know something even more amazing about age-1 (mg44). The mutation which gives rise to this incredible longevity results from a change in a single DNA letter：1,161 bases into the age-1 gene, an A replaces the usual G. That turns a TGG sequence into TGA which, in the language of DNA, means ‘you’re done, stop reading’. As a result, the AGE-1 protein* is about a third of its usual size and missing crucial components. So useless is this truncated protein that, like the first third of a car, with one and a bit wheels and a few random parts of the engine, it might as well not be there at all. Previous age-1 mutants merely made the protein less efficient at its job, and consequently had less spectacular effects – but its complete absence dramatically extends lifespan.

What ghastly poison is AGE-1 that its presence cuts worm lifespan by a factor of ten? And why on earth do worms produce this deadly stuff inside their cells? Cynthia Kenyon refers to daf-2 as ‘the grim reaper’ – which makes age-1 the Terminator crossed with Genghis Khan.

It turns out that both age-1 and daf-2 are part of the machinery which allows worms to respond to changes in food levels in their environment：this is a crucial part of the system which mediates the evolved response to dietary restriction. DAF-2 is an insulin receptor, a molecule which sticks out of the surface of a cell, looking out for insulin to grab on to. Insulin, remember, is the hormone responsible for controlling blood sugar levels in humans, and telling the cells of the body to use or store the nutrients coursing through our bloodstream after we’ve had a meal. A family of 40 insulin-like molecules does basically the same job in worms, telling cells to change their behaviour when there are nutrients around to be used.

If the DAF-2 receptor detects insulin, that tells it that food is plentiful, and it can set in motion processes like growth and reproduction to propagate the species. If it doesn’t detect insulin, then times are lean：if you’re a young worm, it might be worth taking time out as a dauer; in an adult worm, it fires up processes to maintain the worms’ bodies, and hopefully outlast the famine. The DAF-2 receptor detects insulin, and then the AGE-1 protein spreads the good news and gets the processes of rapid reproduction (and rapid ageing) going. If you imagine that DAF-2 is the accelerator pedal which insulin can push to speed up growth, reproduction and ageing, then AGE-1 connects the pedal to the throttle which puts fuel in the engine. Remove the pedal or the connector, and there’s no way for insulin to stamp on the gas, and ageing is slowed down whether you have either mutation – or both.

The end result of this genetic alteration is thus that the worms’ cells end up behaving as though there’s a famine, when actually food could be plentiful. So, in a sense, Klass was right – these genetic alterations were DR by the back door, conferring many of the benefits of eating substantially less that we explored earlier in the chapter. The difference is, this is a fascinating, molecular backdoor which gives insight into how ageing works at the cellular level, not a clunky, roundabout way to actually reduce the worms’ food consumption.

Worms deserve their place in history for firing up the science community about ageing, but you’d be forgiven for not getting overexcited about the relevance of these Methuselah worms for human medicine. However, there is reason to keep an eye on findings in model organisms：evolutionary conservation. While obviously yeast, worms, flies and mice differ from us in many, many ways, they share an awful lot of fundamental biology with each other – and us.

The genes responsible for these incredibly long-lived worms are one such common feature. Mutations in the insulin signalling pathway and growth hormones are also found in long-lived strains of yeast, fruit flies and mice. These include the Laron mouse, which has a mutation in its growth hormone receptor gene – and the longest-lived of which died just a week before its fifth birthday. Because this mutation affects growth hormone, the mice involved mature more slowly and end up much smaller than mice without the mutation, but they go on to live longer and in better health.

In fact, the Laron mice were genetically modified to mimic a condition discovered in humans, known as Laron syndrome. Found primarily in people living in remote villages in Ecuador, this genetic mutation means that the villagers are very small – typically a metre or so in height – but also seems to keep them almost completely free of cancer and diabetes. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to work out whether this confers the longevity benefit that the worms and mice enjoy, and that their own freedom from cancer and diabetes suggests：a study found that the life expectancy of those with Laron syndrome is pretty much normal, but 70 per cent of the deaths in the group were from non-age-related causes, including 13 per cent due to alcohol and 20 per cent from accidents. It’s unclear if their lives would be longer in the absence of these significant drags on life expectancy.

These mutations in insulin signalling and growth hormone genes are a bit like genetic versions of dietary restriction, but sidestepping the need to actually restrict diets：they trick cells into thinking the cupboard is bare when, actually, it may not be. So, while it’s an evocative description, these genes aren’t really the grim reaper or Genghis Khan – they’re a vital survival mechanism which allows worms, mice and humans to alter their metabolism in response to changing conditions in the wild.

We know how vital thanks to more worm experiments：if you put mutant worms into competition with wild ones, you rapidly find out why the grim reaper gene is necessary. On a plate of both N2 worms and age-1 mutants where food levels were varied to simulate the feast-and-famine conditions you might find in C. elegans’ natural habitat, the N2s (with their grim reaper intact) rapidly outcompete their mutant cohabitants. A similar experiment pitting daf-2 mutants against N2s conducted in soil, rather than the usual barren environment of an agar plate in the lab, showed that the non-mutant worms actually lived longer in real-world conditions. Evolution, as ever, is all about trade-offs：in this case, the naturally occurring N2 worms accept a shorter life in paradise in exchange for a more reliable lifespan and better reproductive potential in the real world.

Cosseted in the lab, living free from competition on a plate of genetically identical worms, these longevity mutations bestow worms with lifespans which would be astonishing in nature. This is commonly used to suggest that some of the life- and health-extending interventions we’ll discuss in this book are not practical out in the real world, because they require trade-offs which make creatures more fragile in subtle ways that don’t show up in the lab. However, there’s a much more optimistic take on this：for humans, in the rich world at least, hygiene, healthcare, a steady food supply and so on mean that our pampered lives far more closely resemble those of worms in a Petri dish, isolated from natural hazards, than they resemble those of wild animals, be they worms in the soil or prehistoric people. We effectively live in a giant lab environment of our own construction, and one for which our genes, refined by natural selection for the environment in which we evolved, are not necessarily optimised. This could mean that we may, like C. elegans on a lab bench, be able to benefit from substantial changes to our rate of ageing.

Though it seems unlikely that specific genes discovered in worms will lead to any direct improvements in human longevity, their importance to the birth of biogerontology cannot be overstated. What was thought for decades to be an impossibly complicated process, out of the reach of lab biology, could be substantially altered by changing a single gene – indeed, a single letter of DNA. This placed ageing firmly within the grasp of lab biology.

Mutating a gene in a model organism is one of biologists’ favourite ways to make sense of a problem. You can think of it like modifying or entirely removing one component of an engine and seeing what happens. The consequences can start to tell you what that component is for, and how it affects the parts it’s connected to, providing data with which you could ultimately uncover how the engine works. In a human-designed machine, this is a grossly inefficient route to understanding：the result will probably just be that it stops working, leaving you none the wiser as to the component’s function. In biological systems, which are messy, interconnected, and evolved with layers of redundancy which often makes them robust in the face of small alterations, the results of a small change can be far more surprising – such as a massive increase in lifespan.

If you can alter lifespan so dramatically with the change of a single gene, this gives us the ability to ask a huge range of new questions. What does this longevity gene do? What genes does it work with? If you mutate those genes, does the effect get bigger, smaller, or stop working altogether? By tugging on these threads, biologists were able to start investigating the processes which drive ageing in a far more systematic way than when they didn’t know where to begin. We now know of over 1,000 genes which can increase lifespan in various organisms – including 600 in C. elegans.

That’s why these developments signalled the beginning of a new field. Ageing was now something which could be intervened in, poked, prodded and studied. Studying it was no longer a weird pastime, largely ignored by mainstream biology, and career suicide to take an interest in. We could finally answer the age-old question of what ageing is, not just in the general evolutionary sense of it being a collection of processes involved in deterioration, but in a nitty-gritty, cellular and molecular catalogue of what goes up, what goes down, what might be a cause or an effect. That’s exciting from a scientific point of view, but it’s also critical if we are to have any hope of treating it. Next, we’ll turn to what this exciting new science uncovered.





*The data from the female rats in the experiment are somewhat more confusing – not least because some of them died very early in the experiment during a particularly hot spell, distorting the results.

*You’ll often see dietary restriction referred to as ‘calorie restriction’ or ‘caloric restriction’, abbreviated as CR. Given that, starting with McCay’s experiments, the importance of optimal nutrition (ON) as well as cutting back calories was recognised, it’s sometimes known as CRON, and its disciples affectionately referred to as CRONies. Nonetheless, I’m going to call it ‘dietary restriction’, or DR, a bit of pedantry needed because modern research has called into question whether it’s the calories themselves which are important, or other aspects of diet like protein, or individual amino acids. We’ll return to this in Chapter 10.

*‘Dauer’ is a German word which literally translates as ‘duration’, but in this context means an enduring or permanent state.

*It also requires that the mutation is ‘recessive’ – meaning that it needs to be present in two copies, one from each worm-parent, to cause the lifespan extension.

*Pedantic typography alert：the age-1 gene provides the DNA instructions to build the AGE-1 protein. The nomenclature varies from species to species (of course it does), but worm gene names are usually lower-case italic, versus capitalised normal text for their products.
