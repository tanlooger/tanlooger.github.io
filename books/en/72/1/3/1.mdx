title: Live, fast, die old

Food is delicious.

It’s not surprising. For billions of years, since our most distant evolutionary ancestors, all life has been locked in a struggle to acquire enough food to live and reproduce, or perish. Genes which equip a creature with a desire to seek out and consume food confer a huge survival advantage. Consequently, our brains are wired to enjoy eating, and be wildly distracted by hunger until our need for food is sated. However, evolution hasn’t been so careful when it comes to placing an upper limit on how much we should eat. When you don’t know how long it will be until your next meal, it makes sense to gorge yourself should the opportunity arise.

In the early twentieth century, humans were finally starting to move beyond this natural state of bare subsistence in large numbers and, now that people finally had a choice about what and how much they ate, scientists were beginning to take an interest in the effects of nutrition on health. It was, quite unexpectedly, from this emerging field that the first reliable results in ageing biology would appear.

Scientists experimenting with the effects of nutrition on growth noticed that underfed animals attained smaller overall size – so far, so obvious – but they also seemed to live longer. These early results were suggestive but not conclusive – the number of animals in each experiment was small, and their diets weren’t carefully controlled for calories, protein, vitamins and minerals. However, their findings were enough to intrigue American scientist Clive McCay, an assistant professor of animal husbandry at Cornell, who set about performing the first meticulous experiment which was also large enough to give convincing results.

McCay took 106 rats and split them into three groups, with one group eating what they liked, one on a restricted diet which started immediately after weaning, and another which enjoyed two weeks of free-for-all before having their rations cut. Critically, and in contrast to previous work, McCay kept everything as constant as possible to make sure that the dieting rats got all the vitamins and minerals they needed – the only difference in their food intake was number of calories.

The study set records for rat longevity. On a normal diet, the longest-lived male rat survived 927 days. Many of his compatriots on restricted diets were still going：the last one standing died at 1,321 days old – a 40 per cent extension of maximum lifespan. The average lifespan of male dietary restricted rats very nearly doubled, from 483 in the well-fed group to 894 days.*

Not only were they living longer, the dietarily restricted rats were healthier, too. When they died, the rats were given post-mortems and, upon dissection, those on lean rations had much better looking lungs and kidneys. It was already known that restricting food intake could reduce rates of cancer in rats and mice, and McCay’s findings doubled down on this：none of the restricted rats developed tumours until they were put on a normal diet near the end of the experiment. And, more evocatively, the rats just looked healthier：‘the hair of the animals retarded in growth remained fine and silky for many months after that of the rapidly growing animals had become coarse,’ he wrote in a 1934 paper. These results showed very clearly something which had been dreamed of for thousands of years of human history：the ageing process could be slowed.

It is genuinely shocking to modern eyes that news of these findings didn’t reverberate around the world and lead to widespread, far deeper investigation of this phenomenon – for the first time in history, the process of ageing had been slowed down! Unfortunately, for whatever sociological or scientific reasons, it didn’t. It might have been that ageing wasn’t a major concern in the 1930s, while growth and development were. Life expectancies in the USA at the time had only just reached 60 years, and the spectre of infant mortality loomed large in recent memory. The focus was on ensuring a healthy childhood rather than a healthy old age：McCay’s 1935 paper gives as much prominence to effects on rat growth and development as it does to their lifespan. Over the next few decades, a patchwork of studies did carry on investigating the link between diet, health and longevity, not least by McCay himself, but it was 50 years before dietary restriction – or DR – finally began to be properly investigated.*

These subsequent studies showed that this phenomenon, far from being a quirk of rat physiology, is one of the most universal in biology. The number of species in which dietary restriction works is incredible：we’ve tried it successfully in yeast, the microscopic, single-celled fungi used in baking bread and brewing beer; tiny nematode worms; flies, spiders and grasshoppers; guppies and trout; mice, rats, hamsters, dogs and maybe rhesus monkeys. (Why only maybe? We’ll come to that.) Some of the techniques used to restrict diets in other organisms are unusual. Particularly with the smaller creatures, you have to get inventive when cutting their rations. Nematode worms slurp up bacteria as they slither around, so you have to thin out the ‘bacterial lawn’ on which they graze, and add just enough antibiotics to stop the bacteria from multiplying and turning famine to feast. My favourite methodology was used on water fleas：it involved using pond water to dilute the delicious ‘manure infusion media’ on which they usually dine, and extended their lifespans by a cool 69 per cent.

The incredible universality of this effect, from single cells to complex mammals, is an example of what’s known as ‘evolutionary conservation’. It implies that this response to reduced food levels is ancient, a piece of biology so fundamental that it has been kept in every kind of creature even as the tree of life blossomed into endless forms most beautiful. And its implications are tantalising – if everything from water fleas in dilute manure to dogs on rationed meals live longer and in better health, could it work for humans, too?

There is a catch：despite its evolutionary conservation, the size of the DR effect varies wildly in different organisms. Single-celled yeast can have its five-day lifespan increased by 300 per cent; nematode worm C. elegans lives 85 per cent longer under DR; fruit flies 66 per cent longer; mice 65 per cent longer; mouse lemurs (which are primates, like humans, but are rather distant relatives, and weigh just 50 grams) can have their six-year lifespans extended by 50 per cent; rats come in at 85 per cent or so (as we’ve seen); while the best effort in dogs achieved just a 16 per cent lifespan increase. Cost and practicality mean that we’ve not tried many large, long-lived animals, which makes extrapolating any trend hidden in these statistics to humans (which are, in the scheme of things, large and long-lived) quite tricky.

This debate might have been resolved by the recent conclusion of two studies in some close evolutionary cousins of ours：rhesus macaques, a species of monkey with a maximum lifespan of around 40 years. The good news is that DR did seem to increase healthspan in both studies; the bad is that the effects on lifespan were more ambiguous, and certainly rule out results as impressive as those in worms, rats or lemurs. Human studies have been too short to give any definitive answers on lifespan or healthspan, though short-term markers of health like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and markers of inflammation do seem to be improved.

We’ll return to the rhesus macaques, and whether we should all be practising DR, in Chapter 10. However, for now, suffice to say that it’s no slam dunk：if there is a trend, it probably shows that the effect weakens as organisms approach humans in size, longevity and complexity. Quite apart from any advanced biological argument, given the diversity of diets around the world we’d surely have noticed by now if DR doubled human lifespan – there would be some ascetic religious sect living twice as long as the rest of us, and even modest differences in diet would have much larger impacts on health and longevity than we actually observe.

However, while the dietary debate rumbles on for monkeys and humans, DR is hugely significant in the history of biogerontology. Its foundational contribution, through experiments by McCay and others, was to show that ageing can be slowed – an unambiguous demonstration of a critical fact without which it would be very hard to convince sceptical scientists that research into ageing is worth pursuing. In more recent times, it’s also been pivotal in beginning to decode how ageing works under the biological hood.

A renewed interest in DR research in the last few decades, together with expanded tools for molecular biology, allowed us to examine what happens when food is scarce. The results of these studies actually provide reason to hope that the response to DR might be truly universal：the molecular machinery which implements it is shared in every species we’ve looked in, from yeast to people. When any of these organisms eats something, an almost identical system of molecular detectors and signals alerts the cells to the incoming nutrients and sets about making use of them – storing some for later use, putting others immediately to work building new cellular components, and so on. In the absence of nutrients, this system sends these processes into reverse, telling cells to rein in their manufacturing and hunker down while raw materials are less abundant.

Why might this response to low food levels be so carefully evolutionarily conserved? The most popular idea is based on disposable soma theory, and centres on how animals weigh up the competing energy requirements of somatic maintenance and reproduction. If you find yourself on a restricted diet, and can only choose one, maintaining your body is the obvious option：rather than blowing your calorie budget reproducing one final time in desperation, you can live on to reproduce another day; and it also means that your newborn children won’t arrive into the world during a famine and promptly die themselves. Thus, evolution has selected for animals who allocate more resources to carefully maintaining their bodies when times are tight, slowing the gradual falling apart that is the ageing process. When food is plentiful again, reproduction takes priority and ageing returns to its original pace.

We’ll meet some of the molecular protagonists later in the book – they range from insulin, which you may have heard of as the hormone which maintains blood sugar levels and whose manufacture or detection goes wrong in diabetes, to more esoteric actors you might not have, like mTOR. Having a treatment that reliably slows the rate of ageing has also helped illuminate the processes of ageing, by pointing to biological changes which are slowed under its influence. Were it not for countless hungry mice, flies and worms in labs around the world, we would know far less about ageing today than we currently do.

Whatever else DR experiments show, they tell us loud and clear that ageing is not some inevitable, immutable, unstoppable process. How quickly animals age can be varied by this (perhaps deceptively) simple intervention. Why this didn’t result in a biogerontological revolution before now is academic：DR, along with the many other potential treatments we’ll talk about in this book, provides incontrovertible proof that ageing can be manipulated. We should celebrate dietary restriction for providing us with the poster rats of anti-ageing medicine.

One problem remained：DR showed us that ageing can be manipulated without the need to wait around for your descendants to evolve into some different, slower-ageing species – but it was still not easy to decipher. Ageing still suffered from its image as an inscrutably complex process of wearing out. The fact you can cause animals to wear out more slowly doesn’t do much to reduce that complexity, or suggest that its treatment is any more plausible. Dietary restriction played a critical part in the gestation of biogerontology, but it would take another breakthrough before it could be born.
