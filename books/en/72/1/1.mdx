title: 1 The age of ageing
---



Cast your mind back 25,000 years. It’s late on a warm spring afternoon in what we now call southern France, and you’re gathering firewood a short way from your camp. The men are out hunting, carrying spears and seeking out game like deer and bison. You and your fellow nomads look pretty much like modern humans, but life is very different – not least because of the ever-present risk that it will end suddenly.

At 28 years old you’re doing quite well for a prehistoric woman. There are risks everywhere. A tiny scratch could get infected and kill you; you could meet a sudden end in an accident or animal attack; or other prehistoric humans, hungry and desperate, could murder you in a fight. Most tragic of all, though, out of the five children you’ve given birth to, two have died – one shortly after birth from what we’d now understand to be a serious fever, and another aged three who you buried just a month ago. Prehistory is a dangerous place to live, and death seems to strike at random, often without obvious cause. There’s no understanding of germs or birth defects – perhaps you blame capricious, vengeful gods or spirits in an attempt to make sense of it all.

It’s hard for us to work out exactly how long prehistoric humans lived, not least because prehistory is defined as the period prior to written records. There were no birth certificates or insurance companies compiling detailed mortality tables. However, surveys of bones at a handful of archaeological sites, plus extrapolation from modern hunter–gatherer societies give us some idea – and it’s at once better and worse than you might expect.

First, the bad news：life expectancy was poor, probably somewhere between 30 and 35 years. Statistically speaking, a lot of you reading this would already be dead. However, life expectancy is a number which can obscure as much as it reveals. This is because it’s an average and comes with all the attendant statistical pitfalls. The main reason that it was so strikingly low in prehistory was the appalling rate of infant and child mortality. Infections in the first few years of life struck down many, many babies and children. You probably only had a 60 per cent chance of making it to 15 years old – barely better than tossing a coin. This huge number of deaths at young ages drags down the average age at death significantly.

However, if your coin came up heads and you made it to your late teens, you could expect to live another 35 or 40 years, taking you comfortably into your fifties. This ‘remaining life expectancy’ is itself an average, so it’s quite likely that a few ancient humans did make it into their sixties or seventies – what we, in modern times, would start to call ‘old age’. A headline 35-year life expectancy both masks the terrible toll of childhood deaths and underplays how long the oldest early humans lived. Such is the challenge of summarising a complex phenomenon like human lifespan with a single number.

This was the story for tens of thousands of years：eye-watering levels of child mortality held overall life expectancy down; most who made it to adulthood lived decent but not exceptionally long lives. For millennia, death was an omnipresent feature of human life, often rapid and without warning. Those who escaped the capricious clutches of infectious disease, injury or bad luck were greeted by an inexplicable state of decline which we’d now recognise as ageing：a gradual loss of faculties in a world where fitness, keen senses and mental acuity could be the difference between eating and being eaten.

It can be tempting to think of prehistoric humans as primitive, but their brains were actually very similar to our own; it seems likely that this constant, senseless loss would take its toll. While we can only speculate, there are sites where human or pre-human remains are found together, suggesting some kind of deliberate disposal of the dead. There’s an ongoing debate about when exactly funeral rituals arose – many, of course, would leave no trace which could survive the intervening millennia. But, if these sites are what they appear, funeral behaviour could date back tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, to a time before our species, Homo sapiens, when our hominin ancestors walked, and aged, upon the Earth. As we transition into recorded history, our preoccupation with death is hard to deny：increasingly extravagant structures culminating in the pyramids of ancient Egypt, which formed the engineering pinnacle of increasingly rich mythologies surrounding life and its end.

Given this, it’s perhaps not surprising that some of the earliest philosophers grappled with ageing and death. In ancient Greece, Socrates and Epicurus were unworried by dying, believing that it would be like eternal dreamless sleep. Plato was similarly sanguine, but for different reasons：he believed that our immortal soul would go on existing even after our bodies had ceased to. Aristotle was more concerned by death, and arguably the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to explain ageing scientifically in 350 ʙᴄᴇ. His central thesis was that it was a process by which humans and animals dry out; as you will note from its absence in the rest of this book, sadly his theory hasn’t stood the test of time.

Even as schools of philosophy, religions and empires rose and fell, surprisingly little changed about lifespans for thousands of years. A family moving to London in 1800, looking for work as England industrialised, would have a surprisingly similar tale to tell as their nomadic ancestors, statistically at least. The exact causes of death were quite different – fewer hunting accidents, more factory accidents, and a different spectrum of infectious diseases at home in densely populated urban centres rather than small, nomadic groups – but the result was much the same：high birth rates, high death rates. By this time in history we do finally have some actual data to go on – the two countries whose records stretch back the furthest are the UK and Sweden, and both show an overall life expectancy somewhere around forty years in the early nineteenth century.

As the 1800s got into full swing, things finally began to change. Slowly, between 1830 and 1850, graphs of life expectancy start to pull up. If we take the leading country in the world at any given time, which we can regard as the state of the art in population health for any given moment in history, a very striking picture emerges. The maximum global life expectancy has increased by three months every year since 1840, with clockwork regularity. Even better, the trend shows no sign of abating. Predicting the future is always hard, but you could do worse than to extrapolate this trend of nearly two centuries onwards into it. That means (if you’re middle-aged or younger), for every year you stay alive your expected date of death recedes a few months into the future.* Alternatively, for every day you survive, you gain another six hours – meaning that a good night’s sleep isn’t really time wasted, as you’re getting most of it back thanks to rising life expectancy.

The cumulative effect of this incredible progress is that lives are now twice as long on average as they were in the early 1800s – life expectancy has gone from 40 years back then, to over 80 in the rich world today. It’s easy to be glib about this meteoric rise because it’s so familiar, so take a moment and transpose those dry numbers onto your own life. At 40, you’d be statistically dead in 1800; now, you’ve got as much life again still in front of you. A 20-year-old today has better odds of having a living grandmother than a 20-year-old in the 1800s did of having a living mother. In a bare couple of centuries – perhaps 0.1 per cent of the total timeline of our species – we’ve already redefined (indeed, doubled) what it means to be human. Families are now multigenerational, we can plan for the long term under the assumption we’ll live to see it, retirement is more than a few years of ill health for a handful that make it that far. For the first time in human history, the majority of babies born today will have the chance to grow old.

The straightness of the line showing life expectancy increasing is almost suspicious, because those improvements are underpinned by a tangle of cultural shifts, public health measures and scientific and medical breakthroughs happening more or less at random. And yet, every year：three more months. Successive phases of this revolution have been driven by very different phenomena. It started with the taming of humanity’s greatest ancient foe：infectious disease.

Pandemics are a humbling reminder of the power of nature compared to our own. The coronavirus crisis has laid bare what many of us had largely forgotten：the terrible toll infectious disease can take without treatments or vaccines. Nonetheless, your risk of death from COVID-19 is still substantially less than the risk from infections in the past – taken over the whole of human history, bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms have probably struck down more of us than anything else. Even in the worst case, the consequences of coronavirus are unlikely to exceed those of the 1918 flu pandemic：during that outbreak, 50 to 100 million died over a couple of years at the hands of flu viruses – up to 5 per cent of the global population at the time – dwarfing the 20 million killed in the preceding four years of mechanised annihilation in the First World War. Humanity would do well to remember that our real enemy is not one another.

However, through the 1800s, unhygienic towns and cities were refitted, open sewers replaced, public health initiatives began to take root and infectious disease began to decrease. Science and medicine entered the fray, first with vaccines, and then germ theory, demonstrating that it was tiny, invisible organisms – not bad air or bad luck – that drove infection. Vaccination has since wiped smallpox from the face of the planet (albeit shockingly recently, in 1977), is well on the way to doing the same for polio, and has made former childhood spectres like diphtheria and whooping cough so infrequent as to sound antique. Improved fertilisers and mechanisation of agriculture ushered in better nutrition population-wide, leading to healthier children and adults better able to fend off many causes of death, infections included. At the same time, the twin engines of education and economic growth were lifting millions out of poverty, compounding the improvements in food and cleanliness. Better health and increasing longevity also bolstered the economy, in a virtuous circle of burgeoning health.

In 1850, life expectancy at birth was around 45 years in chart-topping Norway. By 1950, Norwegians (who reclaimed the crown after nearly a century of dominance by New Zealand) could expect to live beyond 70. Progress was largely driven by improvements in early and mid-life – infectious diseases disproportionately struck children, but were also prevalent in adulthood – and their reduction dramatically increased life expectancy overall.

It’s in the last seventy years or so that improved life expectancy at older ages has finally started to move the needle on life expectancy overall, mainly due to huge strides in medical science and healthcare provision, and healthier lifestyles. Taking a survey of other essentials of modern medicine – automatic defibrillators, stents, dedicated coronary care units in hospitals, heart bypass surgery – you’ll find that none of these was available in 1950. Even cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, which uses chest compressions to restart a stopped heart and is a staple of TV drama to the point of cliché, hadn’t been invented yet. Also missing were preventative drugs like statins which lower cholesterol and make heart disease less likely to happen in the first place. And all of this is just in the world of cardiology. Drugs, devices and surgical techniques have improved outcomes for people with many different diseases at all ages, but their effect has been particularly important for the survival chances of older people. This is because, having massively reduced infectious disease, the deadliest health problems today are things like heart disease and cancer, which primarily hit later in life.

Of the improvements in lifestyle, the single biggest has been the decline in smoking. It’s shocking, but the shadow of a single industry – indeed, by and large a single product, the cigarette – is cast over life expectancy statistics across half a century. In 1950, 80 per cent of British men and almost half of women smoked. This generation of long-term smokers created a population-wide crescendo of smoking-related diseases which, because it takes time for smoking to cause disease and death, peaked a few decades later in the 1980s and 1990s – at which time around a sixth of all deaths (and a staggering 25 per cent of male deaths) in the developed world were attributable to tobacco. In total, there are estimated to have been 100 million deaths from smoking in the twentieth century. Smoking rates have more than halved since their peak, and are still dropping – and that drop is now showing up in life expectancy statistics.

The cumulative result of all of this can be seen in global tables of life expectancy：the country with the highest life expectancy in 2019 was Japan, whose citizens live to 84.5 years old on average. And there are plenty of others snapping at its heels – the top 30 countries in the global rankings all have life expectancies above 80 years.

As well as extending lifespan, we’ve also been extending healthspan. A study looking at changes in the UK between 1991 and 2011 found that life expectancy at age 65 had risen by about four years, and so had the number of years spent without cognitive impairment and, if you ask people to rate their own health in a survey, the number of years spent healthy went up by a similar amount again. Improvements in health are most pronounced in the very old：the fraction of over-85s in the US classified as disabled dropped by a third between 1982 and 2005, while the number who are institutionalised almost halved over the same period, from 27 to 16 per cent. Depending on how you measure health or disability, the fraction of our lives spent in ill health is either shrinking or roughly constant, both of which are good news.

The only wrinkle in the data is that, while severe disability is dropping, minor disability – conditions like arthritis which are painful and inconvenient but, except in very advanced cases, still allow sufferers to go about their daily lives without help – seems to be on the rise. One issue might be improvements in diagnosis and recording of diseases and disabilities rather than a true increase in their prevalence. Early detection of diseases can have complicated effects：on the one hand, people seem to get more diseases at younger ages when we look at statistics; on the other, medical or social care can often intervene earlier and improve and extend lives. There is also substantial variation in healthspan between countries, but since it’s much harder to pin down than lifespan there’s room to debate what exactly underlies these differences.

This isn’t a picture totally free from qualification and nuance, but it’s substantially more positive than stereotypes about medical care merely prolonging our years in frailty would have you believe. And, purely theoretically, this is what we’d expect：to die, you have to die of something, which implies you’ll be sick; and the reverse is also true, with diseases which cause significant disability, like heart disease and dementia, also being deadly. It would be strange indeed if we had substantially extended life without postponing disability, so it makes sense that, broadly speaking, that isn’t what’s happening.

Our story so far has concentrated on the rich world. What about in less wealthy countries? The answer, since 1950 at least, is good news. Low- and middle-income countries are very rapidly catching up with those whose historical good fortune allowed them to lead the way. The prevailing tale in developing countries has been one of meteoric rises since 1950：life expectancy in India has almost doubled, from 36 in 1950 to 69 today. The result has been a dramatic reduction in health inequality in the last century. Even in 1950, there was a stark separation between rich and poor：while life expectancy in India was 36, Norwegians could expect to live to 72. Today, Indians are only 10 or 15 years behind the chart-topping countries. Overall, 90 per cent of the world’s population now lives in countries where life expectancy is over 65 years, and 99 per cent in countries where it’s over 60. Though we, of course, have a moral duty to help those in countries stuck with low life expectancies, thankfully, and in difference to just 50 years ago, they are the exception rather than half of the world. The end result of progress over the last two centuries is that most of the world’s population is most of the way through the story just told.

This means that now, uniquely in human history, we have become victims of our own success – the rout of malevolent microbes, the rise of public health, healthier lifestyles, modern medicine and increasing education and wealth have conspired to bring us face to face with a new scourge：ageing. No matter where you live in the world, you’re very likely to live long enough to experience the frailty, loss of independence and diseases associated with getting old. This is the age of ageing.

The age of ageing is a strange time to be alive, but it’s hard for us to appreciate because we all live in it. Most lives have a fairly similar, well-defined structure, and this universality conceals how dramatically different this is from life even a century ago. Though some people’s years are cut short by tragic accidents or disease, they are the exception：most will get to enjoy the classic three-stage life which we’ve become used to – education, then work, then retirement.

That structure is geared to the length and shape of a human life – just not necessarily the lives we live today, or will in the near future. We spend our first couple of decades in education, not thanks to some dispassionate analysis of the optimal duration of learning and development, but because we need to hurry on to the next stage and start work. Then, we try to earn money for 40 or 50 years, partly to provide for ourselves, partly to pay taxes and help the next generation through their early years and assist those already older than us, and partly to save for our own old age. Careers reflect this, with a steady rise through the ranks until we are in our forties or fifties, and a winding down thereafter. The duration and nature of this period isn’t optimised either, but an accident of history, with ‘retirement age’ pegged to the age of onset of serious ill health during the first half of the twentieth century.

It’s tempting for those alive today to assume that the three-stage life, divided approximately as it is now, has been the norm for far longer than is actually the case. In fact, even 50 years ago, far fewer people were alive and in good enough health to enjoy retirement at all. Thanks to rising life expectancies and falling birth rates worldwide, between 1960 and 2020, the global population aged over 65 grew dramatically faster than the population overall：it almost quintupled, from 150 million to 700 million people; by 2050, it’s predicted to more than double again, to 1.5 billion – meaning that over-65s will make up one in six of the global population. The older the slice of the population you look at, the more rapidly it’s growing：the number of people aged 100 or over (known as centenarians) has gone from 20,000 in 1960, to half a million today, to a projected three million in 2050 – a change of over one hundredfold in less than a century. And, like life expectancy, population ageing is also moving faster in the developing world than it did in the rich countries：France, the US and UK took 115 years, 69 years and 45 years respectively for the fraction of the population aged over 60 to double from 7 to 14 per cent; projections for Brazil suggest it will undergo the same transition in just 25 years. This means that poorer countries will have even less time to adapt to the coming silver tsunami.

The social and economic impact of this age of ageing will be dramatic if we don’t act quickly. Pensions provide a salutary and simple example. The first state pension in the UK was paid in 1909 to people aged over 70, and the scheme was updated in 1925, reducing the pensionable age to 65. In 1948, the state pension was made universal, alongside reducing the pension age for women to 60. The pensionable age for women wasn’t changed until 2010, at which point a sliding increase was implemented to make the starting ages for men and women equal, in line with equality legislation. Men’s pensionable age finally rose in December 2018, meaning that the age at which men received a state pension in the UK remained constant for almost a century – during which time, life expectancy in the UK increased by 23 years. That successive governments sat by as life expectancy climbed, leaving what is now quite predictably one of the biggest items of government spending largely untouched, is mind-blowing. The simple fact is, we will need to work longer to pay for a larger fraction of our life spent retired.

We’ve been fortunate that decades of economic and population growth mean that pensions haven’t become a crisis before now, but a crisis is approaching if we do nothing. This news also has a rather positive spin which is rarely highlighted – because we are living in good health for far longer, many current 65-year-olds are more capable of working than our forebears were at the same age. This gives us more time to contribute to the economy and fund our retirement – which could still be longer, healthier and wealthier than in the past. A 65-year-old was old in the 1920s – only just over half of people made it to that age, making 65 back then roughly equivalent to being in your early eighties today. While increasing the retirement age to 80 may raise some eyebrows, there’s clearly some headroom above 65 where a compromise could be reached.

More broadly, the age of ageing highlights the need to reinvent the three-stage life as lives extend. Lifelong education and training will become increasingly important. A life which starts with 20 years of training and ends with 20 years of retirement means a 40-year career when life expectancy is 80; if you live to 100 with the same template, your career is half as long again. Six decades is a long time in the same job – long enough for the job to cease to exist, or for you to get pretty bored of it. No longer will a 50-something be entering the later stages of their career, passing the years to retirement; they could instead take a few years off, retrain and start an entirely new career with the productive decades ahead. With both careers and retirements extending, perhaps we won’t want to work for decades and then retire for decades more, but instead take periodic sabbaticals to return to education, travel or take up new hobbies at different times in our lives. It seems unlikely that three stages is the most efficient life structure even now – let alone as we continue to live longer.

Another feature of the age of ageing is the significant fraction of our resources we devote to taking care of the elderly. Thanks to their multiple diagnoses and medications, the average 80-year-old costs the healthcare systems in the US and UK about five times as much as the average 30-year-old. This is another way in which ageing has been internalised, even industrialised, in our societies. Hospitals, care homes, nurses, doctors, administrators, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and more besides make up a system that swallows up a substantial fraction of our economies – typical rich countries like the UK and Germany spend roughly 10 per cent of GDP on healthcare, while the US dedicates an even more substantial 17 per cent – thanks in significant part to the chronic diseases of ageing. The growing need for long-term medication and care for the elderly means that these fractions are forecast to increase.

On top of these ‘direct costs’ of treating the diseases of ageing, there are also ‘indirect costs’, like people giving up work due to chronic illness, or cutting back their hours to take care of a friend or relative with one. These are often hidden from view and politically neglected, but the indirect costs of diseases like cancer and dementia frequently exceed the direct ones. The total cost is enormous：unpaid care alone in the UK is estimated to be worth about the same as the entire healthcare budget. Once again, this was never planned – but love and a sense of responsibility make up where official provision falls short. We tacitly accept the enormous burden on spouses, children and neighbours and, as gradually more of us get old and unwell enough to need support, this unofficial system will be strained even more than it already is.

As the age of ageing comes into its prime, these costs are going to become increasingly unsustainable. Alongside frank discussions with voters about pension provision, health and social care, our long-term strategy needs to include research into medical treatments for the ageing process itself.

What’s astounding is that the doubling of human life expectancy since the start of the 1800s has been achieved without any treatments for ageing. We’ve scored some indirect hits – improved diets, exercise, cutting out smoking, and preventative medicines to reduce cholesterol or blood pressure all arguably slow parts of the ageing process to some extent – but there’s not a single drug or treatment available in your local pharmacy or hospital expressly designed to slow or reverse ageing.

In fact, regulators around the world – like the Food and Drug Administration in the US, or the European Medicines Agency – wouldn’t grant a licence to sell an anti-ageing treatment even if it did exist. Drugs will only be approved if they treat a specific disease, and ageing is not recognised as a disease, but dismissed as a natural process. This might sound like an insurmountable obstacle to treatments for ageing, but scientists are in the process of overturning these rules – we’ll talk about how in Chapter 11. And there are some hints that ageing is starting to be recognised：in 2018, the World Health Organization added a new code to the International Classification of Diseases：XT9T, for conditions that are ‘ageing-related’. The scientists who proposed its inclusion hope will smooth the path to developing therapies.

Even if we continue to consider ageing an immutable fact of life, it seems likely that life expectancies around the world will continue to rise. There are still improvements to be eked out：earlier detection and better treatments for cancer and heart disease can deliver us a few years, even if they stop short of a complete cure; continued improvements in lifestyle, along with better and more universal healthcare provision can surely add at least a few years too. Given that sublime complexity has led to surprising simplicity thus far, you could do worse than simply extrapolating from the existing trend of three months per year, every year. Running with this assumption makes projections which seem dramatic to contemporary eyes：life expectancies would leap by another 25 years over the course of a century, meaning that we’d expect most babies born globally since the year 2000 to celebrate their 80th birthdays – and most babies lucky enough to be born this millennium in the rich world to celebrate their 100th.

Official projections and many demographers often hold that some intrinsic limit to human life expectancy will eventually stop this increase in its tracks – but no particular reason is advanced for this, and pessimists have been repeatedly proven wrong in the past. One study examined 14 predictions of a limit on human life expectancy, and wryly observed that the average time between a limit being proposed and being broken was just five years.

There are some headwinds to rising life expectancy which could slow progress. One example is the increasing prevalence of obesity. Our growing waistlines are already having a negative impact on life expectancies around the world, but larger positive changes have thankfully been able to outweigh this effect so far. Nonetheless, improving diets and making exercise easier to integrate into daily lives both need to be priorities if we want to make sure lifespans continue to increase. Other factors, from air pollution (whose risks are only beginning to be understood, but seem to affect ageing to some extent – not just in the respiratory system, but by promoting cardiovascular diseases and perhaps even dementia) to antibiotic resistance and emerging diseases like coronavirus (which could see a partial return to the bad old days of deaths from infection) are also worth trying to get ahead of. There are also inequalities which mean, while headline life expectancies increase or at worst stay constant in whole countries, some socioeconomic groups or regions have experienced declines in lifespan in the last decade or so. But nonetheless, if we keep looming threats at bay, carry on capitalising on marginal gains and work to ensure that this success is shared, most people in the world having a solid chance of living to 100 by 2100 doesn’t sound implausible.

The recent history of life expectancy is perhaps the crowning achievement of humanity. No other scientific or technological advance can claim to have bettered the lives of billions in such a fundamental way.

Living at a time where one singular cause, ageing, is responsible for so much – everything from the shape of our life courses, economies and many of our institutions, and the majority of human suffering and death – is humbling, but also genuinely exciting：by tackling this root cause, science allows us the possibility of doing something about all of this at once.

In order to end the age of ageing, we need to understand what the ageing process is. Then we can start to consider the treatments which could address it. Therefore, the next few chapters will be spent exploring ageing and demystifying this process. Science is finally beginning to understand its components, and identify the surprisingly small number of processes which cause us all to get older. We’ll see how breakthroughs in ageing biology took the field from a weird, fringe pursuit of theorists, pioneers and cranks to a legitimate, mainstream area of biology.

The best place to start is to look at the near-universal phenomenon of ageing through perhaps the one truly universal principle in biology：evolution.





*I’m being deliberately vague here, because life expectancy applies to populations, not individuals：it’s not as if some fraction of you is gradually giving up smoking, for example. However, many of the effects are shared and, if you already don’t smoke, you’re ahead of the whole-population life expectancy anyway, so the rise in population life expectancy still provides a guide.
