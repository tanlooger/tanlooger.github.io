title: 4 Why we age
---



Over the last century there have been dozens of theories of ageing purporting to explain why we grow old and die, many of which have buckled under the weight of contrary evidence. Rate-of-living theory, the DNA damage theory of ageing, mitochondrial free radical theory, garbage catastrophe theory：there was a running joke that there were more theories of ageing than scientists to work on them. Which, given the size of the field in the past, might not have been so far from the truth.

One particularly delightful theory of ageing is that all animals have a fixed number of heartbeats in our lifetimes. Mouse hearts beat an incredible 500 times per minute, while Galápagos tortoises’ tickers tick almost 100 times slower at just six. Can it be coincidence that Galápagos tortoises live 175 years, almost 100 times longer than a mouse’s two-year innings? If you collect data from a wide range of different species, there’s a striking pattern – heartbeats per lifetime is remarkably constant, from rats and mice to elephants and whales. We each get about one billion beats, and then we expire.

The theory seems to work within species as well as between them：doctors know that patients with a higher resting heart rate are at increased risk of death. Having a resting heart rate of 100 beats per minute doubles your annual risk of death compared to those people whose hearts beat at 60 bpm. Could this be because they’re burning through their allotted beats with unseemly haste?

While this idea is intriguing, it’s probably of limited practical value. For a start, the relationship between different animals isn’t as tight as the headlines suggest：I’m sure some of you did the maths for the mouse and the tortoise, and it comes out closer to half a billion beats; and humans are massive positive outliers, with roughly three billion heartbeats per lifetime. It could also just be a coincidence – we’ve already seen that bigger animals live longer, and there’s known to be a relationship between body size and heart rate, so maybe body size is the causal factor here. Finally, it’s not clear how or indeed if this would translate into a treatment – though drugs exist to lower heart rate, this would arguably be treating a symptom of the diseases or lack of physical fitness that lead to high heart rate, rather than the cause. And there’s obviously a limit to how low you can go – we could imagine using medicine to move a patient from 80 to 60 bpm, but there must come a point where the heart simply isn’t beating fast enough to supply the body with blood. (The best treatment for a high resting heart rate, incidentally, is almost certainly to do more exercise.)

What biogerontologists, doctors and the rest of us really want to understand is the underlying causes of ageing – the cellular and molecular changes which underlie the downstream consequences for organs like your heart. With the ability to intervene in ageing both genetically and via diet, plus new-fangled molecular biology to pick through the resulting changes, modern biogerontology has had the chance to study the ageing process in far more detail than counting heartbeats. Over the last couple of decades, scientists have uncovered the changes which occur in our bodies as we age, and begun to piece together a coherent picture of how these are connected to the diseases and dysfunctions that accompany the process. This is not just for scientific interest, but also because things which are closer to the root causes are more amenable to treatment：slowing your heart rate to zero to stop you ageing doesn’t make sense, but the idea that eliminating a root cause of ageing might improve your health does.

This new understanding of the underlying causes of ageing has shown us that, as predicted by the evolutionary theories we studied in Chapter 2, ageing isn’t one single thing – but nor is it thousands. We now know enough to attempt to place ageing-related changes into categories. Most excitingly, there are few enough that we can hope not only to explain what drives the ageing process, but potentially come up with treatments to address it.

There have been several attempts to systematically classify theories of ageing, but two modern ones stand out because not only do they provide a classification system, but they do so explicitly to guide devising treatments for ageing. The first, originally published in 2002 and boldly entitled ‘Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence’ (SENS for short), was devised by maverick biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey. In its current form, SENS identifies seven differences between old bodies and young which de Grey suggests are the fundamental causes of ageing. It’s fair to say that it was, and remains, controversial. Because it was motivated specifically by treating ageing, his ‘seven deadly things’ are types of age-related ‘damage’ grouped because he envisages a type of treatment to tackle each one. If we could hit them all at once, he claims we could postpone ageing for long enough to buy us enough time to develop the next iteration of SENS, and so on – which is why he calls them strategies for negligible senescence. If we could manage this, de Grey argues, we could look forward to thousand-year-plus lifespans – claims which have understandably raised a few eyebrows among scientists. Some of the proposed treatments were outlandish, and even the more plausible ones were speculative because at that time none existed, let alone had been shown to work – but the idea of grouping age-related changes like this is a good way to build a framework for treating them.

The second, published in 2013, is known as ‘The Hallmarks of Aging’,* and enumerates nine changes which fit three criteria. First, they need to increase with age：if they don’t, how could they be causing ageing? Second, accelerating a hallmark’s progress should accelerate ageing and, third, slowing one should improve it – these two criteria are an attempt to separate things which are merely associated with ageing from things that are actually contributing to it. Finally, these hallmarks also come with suggested interventions which could slow or reverse their progression, thus slowing or reversing that aspect of ageing, and hopefully putting the brakes on the process overall.

These two classifications have a lot in common. The nine hallmarks and the seven SENS categories overlap substantially – to take one example, what de Grey calls ‘DNA damage’ corresponds to ‘genomic instability’ (the genome being the name for all of our DNA) in the hallmarks, which is a similar (albeit broader) concept. They also agree that there isn’t a one-to-one correspondence between causes of ageing and diseases. Most of the outcomes of ageing, whether cancer, dementia or greying hair, can’t be pinned on a single underlying biological factor, instead emerging as a consequence of several, both acting simultaneously, and interacting with one another. Thus, as we examine them throughout this chapter and the rest of the book, I’ll try to link diseases and symptoms to individual causes of ageing, but things won’t always fit neatly into one category.

Diseases aren’t always the responsibility of a single actor, and sometimes we don’t know exactly what underlies a given age-associated problem at all. It might turn out that some hard-to-attribute problems are fixed by accident when we alleviate a given process of ageing – or it might be that they illuminate new fundamental causes of ageing we’ve missed. As science uncovers more about the ageing process, we may well add more phenomena to this list – but, for now, there’s plenty to get our teeth into.

As well as hopefully having direct medical application, the process of intervening in these hallmarks is one of the best ways to further our understanding of ageing：if we eradicate one of them and find it doesn’t make much difference to lifespan, then perhaps it isn’t a root cause, or maybe something else kills us before it gets the chance; if we fix something and another item is fixed along with it, then it will elucidate the connections between these phenomena.

The first step is to talk about what these underlying features of ageing are. I’ve grouped mine into ten categories which I, too, shall call ‘hallmarks’ of the ageing process. They’re very similar to the 2013 hallmarks (I’ve added two to the list, and grouped two together, meaning I’ve got one more hallmark overall), and follow the same rules：they increase with age, aggravating them worsens health and ameliorating them improves it.

Let’s take a tour of them, starting with life’s most fundamental molecule.
