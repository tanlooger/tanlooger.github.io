title: 3 The birth of biogerontology
---



Modern ageing research is often referred to as biogerontology – the biological subset of gerontology, which covers everything from medical care of the elderly to the social aspects of growing old. It’s foolhardy to pick a precise start date for a scientific field, but the emergence of biogerontology as a distinct, sizeable discipline arguably began in the 1990s – shockingly recent for a field which concerns itself with one of the most significant, near-universal phenomena which afflict living things.

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why ageing research was a backwater of biology for so long. Pre-existing scepticism that ageing was just too complicated for serious study, underscored by an evolutionary understanding of ageing which implied that an almost infinite number of processes contributed to it, certainly played a part. Then, there are socio-scientific factors：no scientists (or politicians funding them) have parents or grandparents who died of ‘ageing’ per se, meaning that research into diseases like cancer which are directly responsible for death tend to get more attention. Scientists also tend to cluster on research topics：there are trends and fads in science just as there are in music and fashion. Perhaps ageing research had a low profile partly because, for whatever reason, it never gained scientific critical mass?

Looking back at its history, one tempting narrative is that scientists needed at least some proof before they were willing to start work on ageing：proof that ageing could be altered, and proof that it could be done in ways which were scientifically interesting, and tractable in the lab. Two sets of experiments stand out as having provided this proof, serving as the foundations of modern ageing biology. This chapter is thus split into two parts：we’ll start with the long-lived hungry rats which provided the first direct evidence that ageing can be altered, and then turn to long-lived, genetically modified worms which showed that not only could it be modified, but that you could do so in remarkably simple ways – in fact, by changing a single letter of DNA.
