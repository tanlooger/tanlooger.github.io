title: 2 On the origin of ageing
---



When Darwin visited the Galápagos in 1835, his remit was far broader than tortoise collection. During his stay on the islands, he made meticulous notes on their flora and fauna, as he did at the many other stops during the nearly five years he spent voyaging on HMS Beagle. These observations formed part of the huge body of work which underpinned one of the greatest discoveries in the history of scientific thought：the theory of evolution by natural selection.

Darwin published this groundbreaking idea in On the origin of species, two decades after his stay in the Galápagos. His great insight (which was independently conceived by his contemporary Alfred Russel Wallace) was that animals, plants and all life forms are optimised for their environment by ‘descent with modification’. Baby animals will differ, quite at random, from their parents; the majority of those differences will be negative or neutral, but those handful with advantageous differences will have greater success surviving, reproducing and thus passing on those qualities to their (more numerous) offspring; those offspring will themselves differ in small, random ways, some slightly better and some slightly worse, and so on. Gradually, over successive generations, the best-adapted will succeed over their peers – the so-called ‘survival of the fittest’.

A famous illustration of this is ‘Darwin’s finches’, a collection of finch species found on the Galápagos Islands which display remarkable diversity in the shape of their beaks. Darwin observed that, in spite of their diversity, they all bear ‘the unmistakable stamp of the American continent’ – the closest large land mass to the islands. Species which live in different places nonetheless sharing features suggests that they may have descended from a common ancestor, but evolved novel adaptations for their new environment. Thorough work on the finches a century after Darwin’s visit finally pieced together the reason for their extreme differentiation：food. Each island offered the birds subtly different food sources – a large beak might give its owner the strength to crunch on seeds, while a pointed one permits catching insects hiding between leaves. Starting from a common ancestor with a single size of beak but some variation between individuals, finches with slightly bigger or smaller beaks could better exploit the local cuisine and pass on their genes. Over successive generations, finches with a beak closer to the optimal shape and size to eat whatever food was available on their island would prosper, ultimately leading to the incredible variety we see today.

Over a century after Darwin’s science-shattering tome, evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky published an essay entitled ‘Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution’. This title pithily encapsulates the universality of Darwin’s theory. If a scientist somewhere uncovers some fact about biology but it doesn’t fit with evolution, they’re going to have to rethink it. The alternative would be to rework the whole of modern scientific thought to sideline the most fundamental law of biology. There are so many lines of evidence, theoretical and practical, and so much of modern biology which does make sense in light of evolution, that it would take some truly extraordinary evidence to overturn it.

As we’ve seen, ageing is a phenomenon which has stalked humans since the dawn of our species. We also see ageing in our pets：dogs with arthritis, no longer so excited to chase a stick; half-deaf cats with eyes clouded by cataracts. Rather more quickly than us, our companion animals too succumb to ageing. So do farm animals and, as the study of different creatures, plants and eventually microscopic organisms began to explore all the kingdoms of life, we’ve found that ageing is (almost) everywhere. From mammals like us, to insects, plants and even single-celled organisms like yeast, ageing seems like a near-universal process of degeneration. And this comes as no great surprise – outside of biology, machines wear out and break with time, buildings crumble and fall. Why should living things be any different?

The question is, how can we square ageing with evolution? If evolution is about the survival of the fittest, what exactly is fitness-optimising about a process of progressive degeneration? The other big question is why we see such diversity when it comes to ageing. The shortest-lived adult insect is a type of mayfly whose females emerge, mate, lay eggs and die in less than five minutes; the longest-lived vertebrate (animals with a backbone, like us) is the Greenland shark, with the oldest known female estimated to be 400 years old. Why does a mouse live for months, a chimpanzee for decades and some whales for hundreds of years? If ageing is a process of wearing out, why do animals do so over such vastly different timescales?

The evolution of ageing sounds like a paradox. Thankfully, though, we can make sense of ageing in light of and not in spite of evolution. Understanding this is not just an exercise in evolutionary theory (though that aspect is conceptually fascinating), or reconciling two huge and apparently contradictory laws of biology (though that is obviously important) – it gives us insight into what ageing is, what it isn’t, and how therefore we might go about treating it.

We need to start by defining what we mean by ageing. We’ll start not with a biological definition of ageing, but a statistical one：ageing is an increasing risk of death over time. An animal, plant or other life form whose risk of death increases as it gets older can be said to age; a creature whose risk of death remains constant, like the Galápagos tortoise, doesn’t. We’ve already seen that humans’ risk of death doubles every eight years – this defines our rate of ageing from a statistical perspective. We can use this definition to make sense of ageing on an evolutionary level, and everything from wrinkles to risk of heart disease will follow from that.

Starting at the most basic level, people sometimes invoke not biology, but physics to explain ageing. ‘It’s just the second law of thermodynamics,’ goes the argument, ‘which says that entropy tends to increase’ – in other words, things become more disordered, and fall apart with time. All good things must come to a messy, high-entropy end, whether they’re steam engines, universes, or animals. This argument is flawed because it omits a crucial phrase：the second law only applies in a closed system. If you’re isolated from your environment, there’s nothing you can do except put off the inevitable descent into decay – but, if you’re not isolated, you can import energy from your surroundings and use that energy to power a spring clean. This might sound esoteric, but it’s actually quite simple – because animals can get energy by eating, and plants can turn sunlight into food, they are then free to use this energy for all manner of biological and biochemical processes which either recycle, remove or replace critical components which are deteriorating. Life is therefore under no thermodynamic obligation to age.

Unfettered by oversimplified thermodynamics, animals have evolved incredible capacities for self-repair – some, like salamanders, can lose a limb and just regrow it. It’s quite the party trick – but there are equally impressive (if less visually striking) phenomena buzzing away on a microscopic scale inside every living thing, including you, all the time. As cells, cellular components or the molecules they are made of are damaged or fall apart, our bodies clear up the detritus and make new, pristine replacements. Myriad molecular machines are constantly maintaining complex structures, ridding our cells of rubbish and generally preserving our integrity. In humans, these processes continue for decades without breaking down. Supplied with energy, there’s no reason in principle why these processes should lose their efficacy over time. Why doesn’t evolution keep on ramping up the effectiveness of self-repair until it becomes flawless indefinitely?

It was probably Alfred Russel Wallace who came up with the first evolutionary theory of ageing. He suggested, in notes written sometime between 1865 and 1870, that older animals ‘as consumers of nourishment … are an injury to their successors’：in an environment where food is limited, too many old animals hanging around and consuming resources would make it harder for their descendants to survive. ‘Natural selection,’ concluded Wallace, ‘therefore weeds them out.’ Animals with a biological expiry date were fitter because they gave their children the space to thrive and have offspring of their own. Independently, a biologist called August Weismann came up with basically the same theory, proposing that lifespan was limited by ‘the needs of the species’.

This theory – and any other which invokes the good of the species over that of the individual – has a fatal flaw. It’s an argument based on what we now call ‘group selection’, where an animal acts in the best interests of a group – usually its whole species – rather than following its own selfish motivations. This is problematic because group selection necessitates an uneasy truce. As long as every animal shares a predilection for growing old for the good of the species, everyone wins, but as soon as one is born with genes for slightly longer life, the delicate balance is destroyed. The ‘selfish’ animal would outcompete the altruists：while they all die, freeing up resources for others, it would consume those resources, allowing it to live a little longer – perhaps just long enough to have an additional descendant before dying itself. This extra descendant makes the gene for longer life a little more common in the population and, eventually, animals with this selfish gene for longevity would come to dominate. Repeat this down the generations with ever-more selfish variants, living longer and outperforming one another to an ever-greater extent as time progresses, and ageing is no longer an evolutionary advantage – indeed, it’s actively selected against, even if longer lives of individual animals are detrimental to the population as a whole.

Group selection has largely fallen out of favour in modern evolutionary biology because this scenario recurs regardless of the trait you choose. Selfish genes will (almost) always create selfish creatures who take advantage of their genetically altruistic peers, eventually coming to dominate.

Instead, rather than invoking some noble utilitarian calculus for the good of the species, we now think that ageing evolved thanks not to evolution’s intention, but natural selection’s neglect. This evolutionary oversight is an inevitable result of the risk of death at the hands of things like infectious diseases, predators, or just falling off a cliff, all of which are external to the animal itself. Together, these are known as ‘extrinsic’ mortality, as opposed to ‘intrinsic’ mortality, driven by something like cancer which is the result of the animal’s own body going wrong. Evolutionary biologists in the middle of the twentieth century realised the significance of extrinsic mortality and laid the foundations of our modern understanding of how ageing evolved.

Let’s imagine some animals living on an island. Life on the island is perilous – there’s a 10 per cent rate of extrinsic mortality every year, thanks to predators and endemic disease. That means that, every year, 10 per cent of the animals die – they have a 90 per cent chance of making it to their first birthday, an 81 per cent chance of making their second … but only 35 per cent of them will see ten, and fewer than 1 per cent will reach 50 years old. Even though you are less likely to find older animals, there’s still no actual ageing in this scenario：remember, our definition of ageing is a risk of death which increases with time, and the risk of death here is a constant 10 per cent. The intrinsic mortality of our animals is zero, however long ago they were born.

Though evolution is often called ‘survival of the fittest’, there is something it cares about far more than survival：reproduction. Evolution’s bucket list for an organism contains just one item – have babies. Mutations which make having children more likely mean that a given animal will, on average, have more of them, and the offspring will carry the mutation which helps with reproduction too; over repeated generations, they will reproduce more than animals without the mutation, and gradually come to dominate in the population.

So, back to the risky island：let’s consider reproduction there. Even if the animals can reproduce throughout their lives, by far the majority of reproduction is going to occur at younger ages simply because most animals will die before they reach a grand old one. Because most reproduction happens in youth, changes that affect an animal’s reproductive chances at older ages won’t make much difference. An animal with some modification that doubled its baby-making capacity at 50 years old wouldn’t have an evolutionary edge because it likely wouldn’t survive long enough to put its baby-doubling powers to use. By contrast, an animal which got a baby bonus aged three would probably still be alive after three years, raring to reproduce, and this trait would mean far more offspring – conferring a significant evolutionary advantage.

The increased ability to reproduce could manifest in lots of different ways, from a literal ability to give birth to larger or more frequent litters, to a longer beak to gather more food and support more children, or just an improved ability to survive long enough to have more children. However it chooses to do it, evolution’s power to tweak and optimise in young animals is significant, because they are likely to be alive and able to pass their genes on to the next generation. By contrast, evolution has trouble improving the lot of older animals because they are very unlikely to pass on their genes simply because they won’t make it that far. This is the fundamental reason for ageing – evolution’s inability to keep old animals fit because they are less likely to have children. All of this, remember, is still possible without invoking ageing itself – there are fewer older animals purely because of extrinsic mortality. Thus, somewhat counter-intuitively, the key driver of the evolution of ageing is the risk that an animal might die of something other than ageing.

The next question is how in practical terms this evolutionary neglect manifests. The first mechanism is known as ‘mutation accumulation theory’. Mutations are changes to the genetic code, alterations to the DNA which provides the instruction manual for building and maintaining an animal. We are all mutants：though your DNA is a 50:50 mix of the DNA from your mother and father, we each carry 50 to 100 variations which are present in neither mum’s nor dad’s DNA. Most of these variations don’t have any effect – they fall into parts of our DNA which don’t really make a difference to our survival chances. A handful will either be positive or negative：those which are positive will improve chances of survival or reproduction, and stand a chance of being passed on with greater frequency in the next generation; those which are negative do the opposite, and should be weeded out by evolution over time.

Back to ageing, and mutation accumulation theory. Imagine some mutation crops up which makes animals spontaneously die at the age of 50. This is unambiguously disadvantageous – but only very slightly so. More than 99 per cent of animals carrying this mutation will never experience its ill effects because they will die before it has a chance to act. This means that it’s pretty likely to remain in the population – not because it’s good, but because the ‘force of natural selection’ at such advanced ages is not strong enough to get rid of it. Conversely, if a mutation killed the animals at two years, striking them down when many could reasonably expect to still be alive and producing children, evolution would get rid of it very promptly：animals with the mutation would soon be outcompeted by those fortunate enough not to have it, because the force of natural selection is powerful in the years up to and including reproductive age.

Thus, problematic mutations can accumulate, just so long as they only affect animals after they’re old enough to have reproduced. Ageing under this theory is not something which makes animals fitter – it’s just that evolution hasn’t got the power to do anything about it. The textbook example of this, which was actually the inspiration which nudged mathematical biology polymath J. B. S. Haldane to come up with the idea of a ‘force’ of natural selection which declines with age in the first place, is Huntington’s disease.

Huntington’s is a brain disease which is caused by a mistake in a single gene, typically giving rise to symptoms sometime between the ages of 30 and 50, and is usually deadly around 15 to 20 years after diagnosis. As we’ve seen, human life expectancy in prehistory was somewhere around 30 or 35 years so, from an evolutionary perspective at least, coming down with Huntington’s at age 40 and dying of it at 55 doesn’t much matter. A ‘wild’ human was already likely to have had several children, and their remaining reproductive lifespan was short. Even in modern times, it’s quite possible for a Huntington’s sufferer to have children before succumbing to the disease. Thus, in spite of its deadliness, Huntington’s persists, albeit rarely, in the human population.

Huntington’s is a clear example of an accidentally accumulated mutation, where a single gene causes something unambiguously and severely bad at post-reproductive ages. But, while deadly single-gene conditions provide clear examples, the bigger deal when it comes to normal ageing is the cumulative effect of many different genes, working alone or in combination, conspiring to slightly erode our chances as we enter our post-reproductive years. Deadly mutations float around in the gene pool, to evolution’s studied indifference, as long as they kill us slowly enough to allow us to reproduce first. Taken together, these imperfect genes ignored by evolution are behind some of the processes which cause us to age.

Ageing isn’t purely accidental, though. On top of being indifferent about your post-reproductive wellbeing, evolution will happily do something even crueller：it will trade your future health for increased reproduction. Evolution will trade literally anything for increased reproductive success.* It will happily trade running speed, height, fur colour, or anything else for more offspring per lifetime. If being faster, slower, taller, shorter, darker, lighter, longer- or shorter-lived will improve reproductive success overall, evolution will take it.

So how does evolution make this deal with death and bring on animals’ decline in exchange for reproductive success? The answer is that genes often have multiple personalities. Modern genetics tells us that genes don’t exist in splendid isolation, coding for a single characteristic. They have multiple functions at different times and in different parts of the body, and interact with one another in complex networks. You should also raise an eyebrow if you ever hear someone speak of a ‘gene for’ a complex characteristic. Even traits as simple as eye colour are under the control of many different genes, and those genes also have multiple functions, playing a role in hair and skin colouration, and they may well moonlight in other processes in ways we are yet to uncover. The multifunctionality of single genes is known in biology as ‘pleiotropy’.

Thus, the second idea in the evolution of ageing is known as ‘antagonistic pleiotropy’ – the idea of genes which have multiple effects allowing them to conspire to aid reproduction in early life, but go on to cause problems as the animal gets older. Imagine a mutation in our island-dwelling animals which increases the risk of an animal dying over the age of 30, but which allows it to reach reproductive maturity a year sooner than otherwise. Carriers of this mutation will rapidly expand in numbers compared to those without – the disadvantage to the few per cent of animals left alive post-30 is dwarfed by the enormous reproductive advantage which will accrue to young animals who now have an extra year to reproduce at a time when most are still alive.

So not only can mutations whose negative effects occur late in life accumulate by accident as in mutation accumulation theory but, if such mutations have a positive effect on reproduction overall, they will be actively selected for. How many years in your eighties would you give up for better physiology as a young adult? Evolution can answer that question, ignoring any poetic musings on the folly of youth and wisdom of age, and instead optimising across the generations to maximise reproductive success.

The behaviour of these antagonistically pleiotropic genes is a little abstract, though. Why would reaching reproductive maturity more quickly result in an earlier demise? Making things slightly more concrete introduces our third and final evolutionary theory of ageing, known as ‘disposable soma theory’. It arises from a principle which will serve you well whatever trait you’re trying to explain the evolution of – in nature, as in everyday life, there is rarely such a thing as a free lunch. Recall how we demolished the thermodynamic argument against ageing：animals and plants can acquire energy from their environment, and use that energy for repair and maintenance. Physics says we don’t have to grow old, just as long as we’re willing to spend some of our energy, hard-earned by long hours hunting and gathering food, warding off the ravages of time and entropy.

Immortality, in biology as in mythology, always comes at a price. In biology, it’s not an ironic forfeit to amuse the gods, but the necessity to maintain your body for an indefinite period of time. Maintenance costs energy – energy which could be used growing muscles to outrun predators, developing an immune system to fend off disease, or becoming reproductively mature more quickly and producing offspring before something kills you.

Disposable soma theory takes this notion of allocating limited energy between different tasks and applies it to reproduction and ageing. The soma is biologists’ word for the cells of the body, as opposed to reproductive cells like eggs and sperm. While it’s perhaps a little depressing to look at yourself this way, as far as evolution is concerned you’re just a vessel for either sperm or babies. It’s been the mantra of this chapter so far：evolutionary success and reproductive success are synonymous. Your children are important, but your body, or soma, is expendable. That means that looking after those reproductive cells is of paramount importance, and all creatures are going to expend energy keeping them in top condition. However, it’s less clear how much energy to spend on maintenance of somatic cells. As with the preceding theories, all evolution really cares about is that you’re capable of sticking around long enough to pass on your genes.

So, as a creature with a limited amount of energy to spend, would evolution rather you spent it on maintaining a pristine physique into your dotage, or gearing up rapidly for reproduction? Evolution will do the sums depending on the level of extrinsic mortality. If it’s reasonably high, evolution is often going to favour the latter, making sure you’ve had children who’ll outlive you and leaving your disposable body to break down with age (if you even survive long enough for that to happen). So, one way that antagonistic pleiotropy could act is via mutations which imbue a lackadaisical approach to somatic maintenance which allows you to grow more quickly as a youth, but which will come back to haunt you when your imperfect body, thrown together in a hurry, reaches old age.

The best way to see these theories in action is to look at the incredibly varied lifespan and reproductive strategies of different animals. Given the intimate relationship between the evolution of ageing and extrinsic mortality, we might expect animals who live in more hazardous environments to reproduce rapidly, and age more quickly once they have. We can see how this holds up by considering two extremes of mammal longevity：mice and whales.

Mice live in a very high-risk environment and need to expend a lot of energy on two things：evading the sharp eyes and claws of cats, and producing numerous descendants quickly before they get ill or get eaten. This means they don’t have a lot of energy left over for optimally maintaining their somatic cells. This tallies with what we see：mice have litters of six to eight pups, and can breed once a month; and they typically live less than two years in the wild. In the benign environment of the lab, they can survive three or four years before succumbing to old age – substantially longer than in nature, but still 20 or 25 times less long than humans.

If instead you’re a whale, monarch of the oceans, and subject to few natural threats, you can afford to chill out, mature more sedately and have children at a leisurely pace. This pushes back the date at which it’s evolutionarily acceptable to die at the hands of accumulated mutations or genes which were helpful in youth, and makes it far more biologically worthwhile to put plenty of energy into somatic maintenance. Accordingly, whales are some of the longest-lived mammals：the record holder is the bowhead whale, with one male found in the wild estimated to be 211 years old.* Bowheads don’t become reproductively mature until they’re in their twenties, and typically have one baby at a time, every four or five years.

Ageing a whale is tough, and the 211-year record was calculated by chemical analysis of the lenses in the creature’s eye – but a remarkable tale of a whale that got away gives us direct proof of bowheads’ exceptional longevity. In 2007, Inuit whalers (one of the few groups permitted to continue whaling on a subsistence basis) caught a bowhead whale which had a harpoon lodged in its bones. The weapon was identified as a type of ‘bomb lance’ – a horrific device designed to explode a couple of seconds after spearing its mark – patented in 1879. Unless the harpoon was an antique at the time of use, this puts the whale’s age at significantly over a century – and to that we need to add on the fact that the whale was big enough not only to be worth hunting, but to shrug off the assault. We might even be underestimating the true maximum lifespan of bowhead whales. For starters, we’ve not actually checked the age of all that many of them, so there could be much older ones swimming around which we’ve missed. But also, and with bitter irony, the lethal effectiveness of the whaling industry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries thinned out the population to such an extent that we’ve not yet waited the 200 years we’d need to have a large population of over-200-year-old whales yet.

Comparing mice and whales also demonstrates one of the most famous observations in ageing biology：the bigger an animal is, the longer it tends to live. Though there are many reasons why being big might promote long life (or indeed necessitate it, because growing big takes time), a significant, simple factor is that if you’re large, you’re harder to kill and eat.

Species which don’t conform to this correlation actually serve to corroborate the relationship between ageing and extrinsic mortality. To keep it as fair as possible, let’s stick with mammals of a similar size. The house mouse, Mus musculus, weighs about 20 grams, while the mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, shares not just its ear shape but also its approximate weight with its namesake, with adults weighing just under 30 grams.

The similarities do not extend to their longevity, though：where a mouse might make it to three or four years in captivity, the longest-lived mouse-eared bat on record had just turned 37 when it died – and that was in the wild, not coddled in a cage in the lab. What lies behind this large difference in lifespan? Well, mice can’t fly. It’s not the pure joy of aerial living which keeps the bats going for longer but, rather, that being in the air keeps them safe from predators. There are far fewer threats up there, meaning that extrinsic mortality is sharply lower for a bat than for a mouse – which means, over evolutionary time, mutations have de-accumulated, antagonistically pleiotropic genes been selected against, and the advantages of disposing rapidly of the soma eroded. Today, bats live radically longer than mice in spite of being fairly close relatives, biologically speaking.

Another animal with a remarkable lifespan for its diminutive size is the naked mole-rat. Naked mole-rats are weird creatures：they look something like a penis with teeth and live in underground tunnels as ‘eusocial’ colonies with a single breeding queen – more like ants and bees than mammals. At 35 grams, they are a little heavier than mice or mouse-eared bats, but they too can live over 30 years. They’re also almost cancer-proof, in stark contrast to mice, and resistant to neurodegenerative disease. Their strategy of scurrying around underground is less romantic than taking wing, and has left them with tiny, beady eyes (it being too dark in their burrows for vision to be much use) and baggy, wrinkled skin (for ease of squeezing through tiny passages past other naked mole-rats – and which also, ironically, makes them look old even as youngsters) – but, nonetheless, it’s worked. There are far fewer predators beneath the earth than roaming it, leaving the ancestors of naked mole-rats able to continually extend their longevity, too.

Humans, incidentally, are also very long-lived compared to other animals of similar size. Our secret to reducing extrinsic mortality isn’t flying or burrowing, but probably relates to our large brains. These allow us to band together in complex social groups, share knowledge, build shelters, make tools, and so on, reducing the risk from external causes of death. As a result, we have evolved longer lives than our close relatives like chimpanzees – the verified chimp longevity champion, a female called Gamma, died at the age of 59.

So biologists can rest easy：in spite of superficially sounding paradoxical, the fact that animals live in risky environments is enough to relax the iron grip of evolutionary optimisation in late life, causing ageing to evolve. There’s only one slight problem：a naïve reading of these theories predicts that all species should age. So how do animals which are negligibly senescent, like the Galápagos tortoise, fit into this picture? We’ve come full circle：now that evolution and ageing are compatible, how can there be animals which don’t age?

The theories we’ve discussed so far are incredibly useful, but they’re inevitably simplifications of what happens in nature. If their assumptions don’t hold, or if other factors we’ve not even considered come into play, different evolutionary strategies can result in unexpected ageing trajectories.

Let’s start with fish. Though they’re scaly and live underwater, fish aren’t such distant relatives of ours – they’re still animals which, like us, have backbones. However, unlike mice, whales or humans, female fish get bigger, stronger and far more fertile as they age. The fact that bigger fish are safer from predators than smaller ones means that their risk of extrinsic mortality isn’t constant – it gets lower with age. They can also produce more or better eggs as they age, in some cases by ridiculous factors, with older fish producing dozens of times more eggs as young ones. These underwater matriarchs are known as BOFFFFs – big, old, fat, fertile female fish – and, in many species, are critical to fish populations. Fisheries are often sustained not by every young fish laying a few eggs, but by a handful of BOFFFFs churning out children at a rate of knots.

This reproductive strategy upends the assumptions which allowed ageing to evolve in our thought experiments：increased survival and fertility in older fish compound to give BOFFFFs a grossly disproportionate opportunity to pass on their genes, creating a significant evolutionary incentive to keep them alive – the force of natural selection effectively reaches far further into adulthood. Perhaps the cold calculus of evolution will find that it’s worth taking care of fish somas after all, and accumulated mutations or pleiotropic compromises which would strike down a BOFFFF are no longer acceptable to natural selection. Thus, fish could evolve whose overall risk of death doesn’t rise with age – in other words, negligible senescence.

There are indeed some fish species which seem to be strong contenders for this. Of those in the running, the longevity crown goes to the rougheye rockfish, a pinky-orange Pacific seafloor dweller which can grow to be a metre long, weigh six kilos, and live to 205 years old, with chances of death that don’t change detectably after reaching maturity.

Unfortunately for BOFFFFs, both commercial and recreational fishing prize large specimens. That means that overfishing hits the BOFFFFs especially hard and could therefore have a range of tragic consequences. First, there’s the risk of fisheries collapsing, causing destruction to ripple through complex ecosystems connected to them. But it would also be a tragedy if species are eradicated before we have a chance to study them – not least to understand their unusual take on ageing. And, even if we stop short of total destruction, preferentially catching BOFFFFs is causing some very unnatural selection to happen in these fish populations. Removing older breeding females will incentivise earlier reproduction, which could lead to genetic changes which introduce ageing into these species.

As we’ve seen, some tortoises are negligibly senescent, too. The best studied are not from the Galápagos, but from Michigan. In a field study which started in the 1950s, scientists followed two types of turtle, known as Blanding’s turtles and painted turtles. Hundreds of them have been marked and recaptured over decades, and no increase of death rate with time was observed in either species. When the study was shut down in 2007, the oldest fertile females were a couple of Blanding’s turtles who were over 70 years old, with no external signs of encroaching frailty. The rationale behind the lack of turtle and tortoise senescence is probably similar to that in fish：older females are pretty safe from external threats (not least thanks to their protective shells), and highly fertile. Once again, natural selection has every reason to keep them alive, and the result is that they don’t seem to age.

There are also weirder creatures, far further removed from humans than fish or tortoises, which sidestep senescence by other means. Hydra are a type of small, freshwater organism, made up of a centimetre-long tube with a sticky ‘foot’ at one end, and a ‘mouth’ at the other, encircled by flailing tentacles which grab their tiny aquatic prey and paralyse them with neurotoxic spines. They were initially of interest to science because of their startling regenerative capacity – chop off basically any bit of a hydra and a complete new hydra will grow from it. Only after this was it noticed that they survive an incredibly long time in the lab – to the point where, so far, hydra have outlived attempts to probe the limits of their longevity. They also show no signs of declining fertility or increasing risk of death no matter how long we keep them – and, based on the death rates observed in lab-grown hydra, it’s estimated that 10 per cent of them would make it to 1,000 years old.

The regenerative capacity and off-the-chart lifespan of these tiny critters may not be unrelated. Hydra violate the central assumption of disposable soma theory – since any part of their body can go on to make a new hydra, there is no distinction between body cells and reproductive cells. In effect, they’re all reproductive cells, so evolution doesn’t consider any of them disposable. This is a hack which is only going to work with very simple forms of life – complex life from insects to humans all undergoes a one-way conversion of reproductive cells to body cells, allowing us to have such diverse tissues and organs – but it shows how almost no assumption is safe in the face of real-life biology. Nature will continue to outwit our theories for some time to come – and ageing itself, if it has to.

There are also evolutionary pressures which could select for longevity almost directly, not as a side effect of high late-life reproductive capacity or blurring the lines between soma and reproductive cells. Enter what’s thought to be the longest-lived multicellular life form on Earth：a bristlecone pine at a top-secret location in California’s White Mountains. A core taken from this tree’s trunk in the late 1950s had nearly 5,000 rings. The tree is still going strong today, at an estimated 4,850 years old. That means it germinated at the start of the third millennium ʙᴄᴇ, when Stonehenge was just a ditch and a few small stones, and work on the pyramids was yet to begin.

How a tree could evolve to be able to outlive whole civilisations isn’t entirely certain, but one theory is that it’s to do with competition for space. Bristlecone pines live in arid, exposed environments where all the habitable locations are already occupied by incumbent adult trees, meaning opportunities for saplings are rare. Basically, you need the tree next door to die in order to free up a spot where your descendants could set up shop. Thus, the only way to pass on your genes is to outlive your neighbours, starting an evolutionary arms race whose endpoint is extreme longevity. Obviously this kind of logic doesn’t apply to animals which can simply walk to another location if things are getting crowded – but it is another example of how a simple quirk of natural environment can significantly affect the evolution of ageing.

Depending on the relative strength of all of these factors and more, negligible senescence doesn’t seem so bizarre an outcome. Change the relative likelihood of survival and importance of reproduction by organisms of different ages, and evolution will custom-build you a life course which optimises for that – with a huge spectrum of different results, from those mayflies which live for only a few minutes, to trees which survive for thousands of years.

If it makes evolutionary sense in some cases to have a risk of death which is constant with age, could we take the next logical step – is there the possibility of negative senescence, a risk of death which decreases with age? Though we don’t know of many life forms lucky enough, there do seem to be some which possess it：for example, the best data we have on the desert tortoise suggests slightly negative senescence throughout its adult life. There’s probably nothing special about negligible senescence, and it would be slightly weird if there was a hard floor of zero for change in risk of death with age. There are probably more creatures with negative senescence out there, just waiting for careful demographic studies to uncover them – assuming human consumption or environmental destruction doesn’t wipe them out before we get the chance.

Thus, the evolutionary theories of ageing don’t just explain why some animals get old, but also open the door to slowing or even removing senescence entirely. There are real-world examples of organisms which sidestep ageing, and we have solid theories about the forces which have subdued their tendency to degrade with time. For anyone interested in changing the course of human ageing, this is incredibly exciting news：negligible (or even negative) senescence not only doesn’t break the laws of physics – it doesn’t break any laws of biology either.

Nature also shows us that lifespans vary by a large amount between even quite closely related species. Comparing mice to bats and naked mole-rats is a striking example of how animals with similar size and relatively recent common ancestors can nonetheless age in very different ways. This shows us that ageing isn’t some immutable, inevitable process：these variations between animals prove that learning to evade ageing is possible. They also provide inspiration：comparing the biology of species with different ageing rates will allow us to identify the genes and mechanisms which promote longevity in long-lived species, and try to develop drugs or treatments to mimic them.

However, the most important thing that an evolutionary explanation provides is insight into what ageing is and what it isn’t. We now know that we don’t all have some ticking, internal clock, programmed to kill parents to make space for their children. It might be easier if we did – all we’d need to do is find the time bomb in our genes, defuse it, and ageing would be cured.

Instead, ageing is an evolutionary oversight：a result of mutations accumulated which worsen fitness in old age but evolution can’t get rid of; antagonistically pleiotropic genes that maximise reproductive success in youth even if they have unfortunate unintended consequences in later life; and mechanisms that prioritise having children over maintaining our disposable somas. There is therefore no reason to expect that ageing should have a single cause – indeed, we should expect it to be made up of a collection of synchronised but only somewhat related processes. It’s our job to identify these processes, and treat them.

However, this kind of can-do attitude has only been tenable for the last couple of decades. The evolutionary theories of ageing were developed in the middle of the twentieth century and, in spite of being significant strides in our understanding, they had an ironic and unfortunate side effect. Ageing had long been largely ignored by biologists, seen as a phenomenon of gradual deterioration not really amenable to study. These evolutionary theories underlined this hopelessness：they suggest that many processes are likely to contribute to ageing, with no obvious limit on the number of contributors. There could be hundreds or even thousands of different factors, interacting in myriad different ways, all conspiring to end us. Evolutionary theory doubles down on the idea of ageing as a process so tangled and multifaceted that it’s unlikely ever to be understood, let alone treated.

If we are to be confident about understanding ageing and, ultimately, curing it, we need to be convinced that it can be tackled on something other than evolutionary timescales. The discoveries which permit us to imagine doing so are the subject of the next chapter.





*This is actually a circular statement. We see the survivors of millions of generations of living things, and the reason that we see the organisms we do is that they were more reproductively successful than those who didn’t make it. It’s often easy to talk of it as though evolution itself is an entity, ‘wanting’ this, ‘making trade-offs’ for that, and so on (and I will continue to do so unapologetically throughout this book!). But really, ‘evolution’ is just a word for the passive, tautologous process of things with high reproductive fitness being good at reproducing.
