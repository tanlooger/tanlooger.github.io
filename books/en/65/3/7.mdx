title: 7 Truth and Objectivity
---







IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS we have traced the development of three kinds of intellectual absolutism and looked at their consequences for historians. The first, the Enlightenment faith in the heroic model of science, prompted historians to become like scientists and turn themselves into neutral and passionless investigators in order to reconstruct the past exactly as it happened. The second, the idea of progress, encouraged them to look to history to discover the laws of human development as those laws worked themselves out in sequential stages. This search for enduring principles of social action, of course, carried with it the assumption that beneath the flow of the daily actions of men and women there was an undertow of forces pulling those actions into orderly processes of change.

The last intellectual absolutism arose from the powerful national sentiments that nineteenth-century men and women drew upon for a sense of identity. Powered by the revolutionary forces unleashed at the end of the eighteenth century, the engine of nationalism drove historians to place their countries—and by extension their fellow citizens—into the larger design of world history. Building the nation became an absolute value, and history’s contribution to that effort was assumed unreflectively. Behind all of these absolutisms was the radiant concept of nature—not the lush and untamable nature of the primitive world or the nature that pushed Adam and Eve to sin, but the nature of science, of progressive improvement and spontaneous order that human inquirers now perceived beneath the flotsam and jetsam that floated to the surface of daily life.

This highly volatile mix of aspirations for history coexisted with surprising ease for over a hundred years. All these ideas could harmoniously occupy the same intellectual space because they were freshly minted theories unscarred by rough encounters with verification. The notion that random events actually composed themselves into invisible processes of change compelled belief in part because Newtonian laws of gravity had made people familiar with the paradoxical contrast between appearances and reality: what was seen deluded the senses and belied the invisible, real structuring of the physical world. Throughout the nineteenth century, science—its methods, projects, expectations, and heroes—put into circulation new coins for cultural negotiation as Western societies moved at different paces toward modernity. Science gradually replaced religion as the provider of models and metaphors for comprehending social experience.

Every carefully researched work of national history shared in the warm approbation accorded science because it revealed how each country figured in the overall framework of social progress. This twinned respect for science and nationalism deflected attention from the possibility of their divergence, from the real prospect, for instance, that histories about national grandeur might conflict with those that used scientific methods to investigate how nations have persecuted their minorities. The tension between patriotic presentations of one’s country and accurate reconstructions of national failures remained to be probed in the future, leaving nineteenth-century scholars free and undisturbed to gather records and perfect research methods, taking in their industry hostages for future skeptics to liberate.

Since the scientific enterprise involved drawing a fixed boundary between the objective reality of things-as-they-are and the subjective realm of things-as-we-would-like-to-them-to-be, historians were loath to explore the subjective component of history-writing. Fact had to be distinguished from opinion, documentary evidence from interpretation. In this intellectual milieu of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the historian’s practice of merging the two remained in a conceptual limbo, undiscussed and unacknowledged. A Carl Becker might wryly comment that the historian “does not stick to the facts; the facts stick to him,” but this belle-lettristic needling was easily shrugged off. American historians chose to think of themselves as empiricists seeking to discover and document objective facts.1 Even to entertain the proposition that knowledge was an intellectual production rather than a disinterested reading of physical and textual evidence induced a dizzying uncertainty that one scholar aptly termed the “vertigo of relativism.”2 Quite naturally wishing to avoid the seasickness of shifting personal perspectives, historians generally sought to avoid philosophical issues, which they dismissively categorized as “theory.” Many wrote as though analyzing the course of human progress was as straightforward a task as isolating disease-causing germs. Others recognized changes in standard interpretations of events, but ascribed them to a kind of Oedipal tendency for successive scholarly generations to revise the findings of their fatherly predecessors.





The Relativist Attack on Truth and Objectivity



Since the 1960s, all the regnant absolutisms of the nineteenth century have been dethroned. A many-pronged attack coming from a variety of perspectives has zeroed in on the goals of objectivity and truth-seeking. A fluid skepticism now covers the intellectual landscape, encroaching upon one body of thought after another. The study of history has been questioned and its potential for truth-finding categorically denied. “Who said that history is about truth?” asks the skeptic. Having been made “scientific” in the nineteenth century, history now shares in the pervasive disillusionment with science which has marked the postwar era.

Some skeptics are social constructionists, once called strong programmers, who see both science and history as intellectual contrivances or discourses, spun out of words, which only incidentally touch things that exist outside the separate, seamlessly interwoven linguistic tapestry. In the Anglo-American academy, social constructionism surfaced in the history and philosophy of science in the late 1970s. Postmodernists, many with debts to French theorists, have since then joined the ranks of skeptics. In their deconstructive enterprise, they have fastened onto the irreducible element of arbitrariness in the production of all knowledge, going on from this observation to question the capacity for human beings to understand anything outside of their own closed systems of communication.3

All of these contemporary thinkers have attacked the scientific influence of their forebears with a passion equal to the rage once reserved for the infamies of the old regime. Raising a banner more appealing than that of the esoteric philosophers of science, postmodernists have captured the public attention as the quintessential relativists of the day. In their view, since all historical inquiries grow out of the inquirer’s linguistic frame, the results follow all too predictably from the hegemonic power of the Western white males initially responsible for the linguistic structure. The writing of history, these critics maintain, is not about truth-seeking; it’s about the politics of the historians. One man’s truth is another woman’s falsity, and they point to the historiographical wars of the last twenty years as proof. Dorothy’s dog Toto exposes the Wizard of Oz as an ordinary middle-aged man; similarly, the skeptics believe, they have revealed historians to be no more than specialized storytellers whose claims to recover the past as it actually happened belong to the smoke screen of scientific pretentions. Historians, as Hayden White has maintained, “do not build up knowledge that others might use, they generate a discourse about the past.”4

Moving beyond the undeniable subjectivity of history-writing, contemporary critics have also weighed and found wanting the rhetorical strategies and narrative form of historical scholarship. As hermeneutically astute analyzers of how words can promote illusions, these commentators rightly point out that historians have minimized the limitations of their perspective by speaking from an omniscient point of view: “Napoleon marched his armies across the continent of Europe,” “Americans believed that a manifest destiny carried them across the North American continent.” With such verbal derring-do, historians, they charge, give the impression that they have levitated themselves off the ground to a superior observational position.

The language of scholarship, moreover, makes it sound as if history, not historians, were doing the talking, the authoritative voice of the all-seeing author lulling readers into believing that the information comes from a transcendent place. These conventions for presenting historical knowledge, moreover, create the appearance of a dispassionate approach, uncontaminated by partiality or interest, unconstrained by the limitations of a single vantage point. Flawed too, in the critics’ opinion, are the words employed to describe the past, because words lack the fixing precision of a photograph and hence can change their meaning, chameleonlike, with every reading. Evicting history from the category of knowledge, these doubters prefer to lodge it along with poetry and novels in the expansive domain of literary constructions, thus turning a grand pillar of objective knowledge into a literary genre.

Much must be given up to the discerning skeptics who have done battle against the nineteenth-century scientific claims that objective truth can be definitively captured. In dragging out from the shadowy world of unexamined assumptions the discrete propositions undergirding the objectivity of science, these Davids of dissent have taken on the mighty Goliath of Western metaphysics. Refusing to become worshipers at the altar of progress, successive groups—inspired first by Nietzsche—confronted the celebratory self-defining ideas of the West and showed that they owed more to the hubris of power than to any rigorous examination of how knowledge was constructed. Their efforts to liberate the thinking of historians from the tyranny of positivism have continued to generate intellectual excitement, because these critics forced into the open the centrality of interpretation in all historical scholarship. Moving beyond the reconstruction of the past to the whole domain of written histories where research designs and rhetorical strategies are worked out, they have alerted an unwary public, as well as their peers, to how the different perspectives of historians enter into their books. Focusing fresh attention on the range of interpretive and linguistic choices at play, all this detective work has led critics to the scene of the primal crime—the individual consciousness where choices are negotiated. The understanding of the processes through which human beings create information has been greatly extended by examinations of historians as the carriers of culturally encoded ideas. Similarly, hermeneutics has shown scholars and their readers how words shape consciousness.

These sophisticated insights into how knowledge is produced have been greeted more as clever exposés than as advances in human understanding. We attribute this perverse reaction to the fact that despite this generation’s well-broadcast scorn for positivism, positivism has left as its principal legacy an enduring dichotomy between absolute objectivity and totally arbitrary interpretations of the world of objects. When postmodernists mock the idea that the human mind mirrors nature or that historians write the past as it actually happened, they are knocking over the straw men of heroic science and its history clone. Similarly, when readers, confronted with various interpretations of the causes of the First World War, conclude that subjectivity taints all history, it is heroic science’s disdain of any element of subjectivity that prompts this resort to the lexicon of impurities. Nineteenth-century philosophers so overdichotomized the difference between objectivity and subjectivity that it is difficult, when using their terms, to modify the absolute doubt that springs from the recognition that human minds are not mirrors and recorders.5 Denying the absolutism of one age, the doubters, however, seem oblivious to the danger of inventing a new absolutism based upon subjectivity and relativism.





Practical Realism



In the post-heroic situation, the world described by science is separate from language and yet inextricably tied to it.6 Contemporary understanding of how knowledge is created now prompts calls for a different, more nuanced, less absolutist kind of realism than that championed by an older—we would say naive—realism. The newer version—what is called practical realism—presumes that the meanings of words are never simply “in our head,” nor do they lock on to objects of the external world and fix reality for all time. Linguistic conventions arise because human beings possessed of imagination and understanding use language in response to things outside of their minds. The structure of grammar is a linguistic artifice, but significantly one that has been developed through an interaction with the objective world, through a struggle to name things that human beings would encounter, even if unnamed. In contrast to poststructuralists, practical realists emphasize the function of words in articulating the multifarious contacts with objects. Communicative and responsive, words serve the goal of truth-seeking exactly because they are not the arbitrary tools of solipsists. Grammar may be deeply embedded in the human mind, but words result from contact with the world.

Contemporary philosophers have reminded historians, as well as readers of histories, that there cannot be an exact correspondence between words and what is out there, between the conventions employed when speaking about the world itself and its contents. Their admonitions point to the fact that the myth of correspondence inherited from the philosophical realists owed much too much to heroic science and not enough to the intuitive wisdom of the practitioners of history.

Let us try now to conceptualize the relationship of the world and human investigators shorn of a belief in correspondence, i.e., in the precise fit between what is in the human head and what is out there. Put in terms useful to the historian, there are the records of the past and there is the interpretation of those records. The gap between them is the source of concern. At best, the past only dimly corresponds to what the historians say about it, but practical realists accept the tentativeness and imperfections of the historians’ accounts. This does not, however, cause them to give up the effort to aim for accuracy and completeness and to judge historical accounts on the basis of those criteria. By contrast, relativists (who are antirealists) say that such confidence in historical narrative is self-serving and untenable, because any kind of correspondence is impossible.

Making modified, practical realism an ally in the campaign against relativism does require some explaining of motives. The aesthetic appeal should not be overlooked. Some historians, like old-fashioned artists, find realism attractive.7 They are attracted by the challenge of reconstructing what appears in the mind when it contemplates the past, much as Vermeer might have been attracted to the challenge of representing the city of Delft. However, historians must deal with a vanished past that has left most of its traces in written documents. The translation of these words from the documents into a story that seeks to be faithful to the past constitutes the historians’ particular struggle with truth. It requires a rigorous attention to the details of the archival records as well as imaginative casting of narrative and interpretation. The realist never denies that the very act of representing the past makes the historian (values, warts, and all) an agent who actively molds how the past is to be seen. Most even delight in the task.

The experience—as distinct from the writing—of history can help to make practical realism more concrete. The very effect of historical change, the ending of wars, for example, and the influence that such external changes have upon thinking give the lie to the notion that words are arbitrarily connected to things. Events can irretrievably alter the way words are arranged in our minds. Yet, as the phrase “better dead than red” illustrates, words can also be arbitrarily affixed. Once the phrase described a bellicose mind-set and, for those who possessed it, a conviction. Yet the time may soon come when children will need an explanation for the statement lest they think it to have been the rallying cry of an especially violent school of expressionist painters. Descriptions of “reality” can on occasion lose their meaning, and then the words become unstuck from the reality which their believers once so ardently endorsed.

People who think or write about the past should take consolation from knowing that no philosopher (whether from Paris or Vienna) has ever succeeded in proving that meanings are simply “in our head” or, the reverse, that human language can be fixed on objects and describe for all time the way the external world is. In other words, the “facts” need the “conventions” and vice versa. Put another way, the historian does not say that an interpretation can exist separate from the practices and discourses employed by the author. The historian is not the alchemist who invented the reality of the past by happily mixing the black facts of the past with white verbal descriptions nor the scientific observer who claims to produce a gray narrative that transparently corresponds to what went on back there, then. The historian is someone who reconstructs a past pieced together from records left by the past, which should not be dismissed as a mere discourse on other discourses.

Practical realists are stuck in a contingent world, using language to point to objects outside themselves about which they can be knowledgeable because they use language. This slightly circular situation in which the practical-minded find themselves may not make for heroes, but it does help locate truths about the past. More important, practical realism thwarts the relativists by reminding them that some words and conventions, however socially constructed, reach out to the world and give a reasonably true description of its contents. The practical realist is pleased to have science as an ally, because the study of nature suggests that having knowledge of a thing in the mind does not negate its being outside of the mind behaving there as predicted.

Well over a century ago, the American pragmatist Charles S. Peirce said that the realist makes “a distinction between the true conception of a thing and the thing itself…only to regard one and the same thing from two different points of view; for the immediate object of thought in a true judgment is the reality.”8 That something exists as an image of something’s being in the mind does not in the least diminish its external existence or its knowability through the medium of language. That it could be in both places, out there and in here where words reside, seems only to verify the objective nature of everything from buildings to time. They are knowable, usable things separate from the linguistic expressions used to describe them, yet capable of being “captured” in the mind by words that point back out toward the thing itself.

The modified, or practical, realism endorsed here connects words to things by using words, but it does more than that. Practical realism serves another goal: it fuels, rather than debunks, the passion to know the past. Practical realism endorses knowability experienced by human agents able to use language, whether alphabetical or numerical. This is not, however, to presume that there can be any “algorithm” or single path to truth. At the philosophical level, realism permits historians to aim language at things outside themselves. Being practical realists means valuing repositories of records as laboratories. The archives in Lyon, France, are housed in an old convent on a hill overlooking the city. It is reached by walking up some three hundred stone steps. For the practical realist—even one equipped with a laptop computer—the climb is worth the effort; the relativist might not bother. Historians find more than dust in archives and libraries; the records there offer a glimpse of a world that has disappeared. Assuming a tolerance for a degree of indeterminacy, scholars in the practical realist camp are encouraged to get out of bed in the morning and head for the archives, because there they can uncover evidence, touch lives long passed, and “see” patterns in events that otherwise might remain inexplicable.

From the seventeenth century onward, science made such spectacular progress that almost everyone fell under its sway. Historians once called their methods scientific and strove for detachment because they thought science provided the only road to truth. Having become less awestruck, less convinced that all truth must be packaged in an equation, historians now look back on the yearning to behave like scientists as part of their own past. It is time to move on, but not without retrospective gratitude.





The Link Between Natural and Human Sciences



Leaving behind heroic science and heroic models of knowledge, historians must still participate in the ongoing discussion between the natural and human sciences. The debt of the social and human disciplines to science is so great—they share so much history and so many common epistemological problems—that divorce is simply not an option. Many of the same theoretical issues, as well as moments of cultural optimism or pessimism, affect all the available forms of human inquiry. Notice that just like historians, scientists confront relativism, if only in the form of anti-science movements, from creationism to New Age cults, or simply as promoted by the information disseminated by the Tobacco Institute. These may not seem like very formidable challenges in comparison to those faced by the social sciences, but science’s relative insulation from skepticism has more to do with the public’s old habits of deference than with any natural protection. The privileged position of postwar American science may also require—as our final chapter suggests—some new and serious rethinking.

Despite their relationship to the natural sciences, the human sciences, such as history, have a distinct set of problems. Any analogy to natural science falters because the historian or sociologist, even the economist, cannot effectively isolate the objects of inquiry. Even when they study living creatures, the scientists’ and historians’ attentions diverge. Humanists study action which is responsive to intentions, whereas naturalists investigate the bounded world of behavior.

Because they are most often found in texts, the remnants of the past usually present themselves in words. Unlike atoms, however, words cannot be disentangled from one another or their referential framework. There are no supercolliders into which historians can funnel the words from old records and manuscripts to be bounced around in a sealed environment and examined for traces of meaning. Indeed why would historians want to? The point of any scrutiny of texts for evidence of the past is not to isolate the language, however delightful and liberating the play of words disconnected from “reality” can seem. The task is to connect one text to another, to retrieve word by word, a forgotten, but never wholly lost moment in time. If by deconstructing a text the critic means to show its inability to represent a fixed past, this can only be done as a result of a prior reconstruction.

Historians cannot comprehend all the variables bombarding a single event. Human beings participate in a dense circuitry of interacting systems, from those that regulate their bodily functions to the ones that undergird their intellectual curiosity and emotional responses. A full explanation of an event would have to take into consideration the full range of systematic reactions. Not ever doing that, history-writing implicitly begins by concentrating on those aspects of an event deemed most relevant to the inquiry. The historians’ laboratories, which are seminar rooms and archives, are also constantly being invaded by robust words—those used in the past as well as those currently in use. Historians cannot quarantine their texts, even though such attempts at isolation occur every time a text gets classified, e.g., “Those records are about shipping,” “That book is about religion.” In fact, these classificatory systems are always porous and frequently misleading. Historians think categories like science, magic, gender, and sexuality are value-free, but then their divisions turn out to reveal more about present-day categories than about what people in the past thought or did. Even the academic disciplines around which university departments are organized represent rough-and-ready classifications which can’t stop historians from drawing upon anthropologists, philosophers, biologists, or literary theorists.

The most distinctive of historians’ problems is that posed by temporality itself. For the historian, truth is wrapped up with trying to figure out what went on in time past. The records are left by people who lived in the past, but—and this is the tricky part—the records are extant in the present. The past, insofar as it exists at all, exists in the present; the historian too is stuck in time present, trying to make meaningful and accurate statements about time past. Any account of historical objectivity must provide for this crucial temporal dimension.





A New Theory of Objectivity



A theory of objectivity for the twenty-first century will owe as much to science’s critics as to its champions. Most of all it will be indebted to this generation’s collective capacity to hold on to what can be known while letting go of much of the territory staked out for mastery during the heyday of positivism. We think that a case can be made for a qualified objectivity after this refurbished objectivity has been disentangled from the scientific model of objectivity. What we will offer is a late-twentieth-century understanding of historical truth. We start with the object that first engages historians—the past—and build our case by retrofitting the house of history that we’ve inherited, stripping away the plaster of grand expectations so that we can see once more the beams and joints of modest inquiries about what actually happened and what it meant to those who experienced it.

No longer able to ignore the subjectivity of the author, scholars must construct standards of objectivity that recognize at the outset that all histories start with the curiosity of a particular individual and take shape under the guidance of her or his personal and cultural attributes. Since all knowledge originates inside human minds and is conveyed through representations of reality, all knowledge is subject-centered and artificial, the very qualities brought into disrespect by an earlier exaltation of that which was objective and natural. Our version of objectivity concedes the impossibility of any research being neutral (that goes for scientists as well) and accepts the fact that knowledge-seeking involves a lively, contentious struggle among diverse groups of truth-seekers. Neither admission undermines the viability of stable bodies of knowledge that can be communicated, built upon, and subjected to testing. These admissions do require a new understanding of objectivity.

At the popular level where deconstruction still refers to razing buildings, there is a pervasive opinion that somehow the past lingers on to force the hand of those who study it. In reality, the past as a series of events is utterly gone. Its consequences, which are very real, remain to impinge on the present, but only a retrospective analysis can make their influence apparent. What stays on visibly in the present are the physical traces from past living—the materials or objects that historians turn into evidence when they begin asking questions. These traces, alas, never speak for themselves (even oral histories occur after the event). Neither do they totally disappear. Usually they remain where people left them in discarded trunks in attics, in inscrutable notations in ledgers, in the footings of abandoned buildings; sometimes they are collected in repositories and archives. Some of this physical residue lies forgotten, but close enough to the surface of life to be unexpectedly happened upon. Then like hastily buried treasure or poorly planted land mines they deliver great surprises. History is never independent of the potsherds and written edicts that remain from a past reality, for their very existence demands explanation. The past cannot impose its truths upon the historian, but because the past is constantly generating its own material remains, it can and does constrain those who seek to find out what once took place.

Two questions go to the heart of the issue about historical objectivity. Just how much and in what ways does the inert past exercise an influence upon active historians? The extreme, literal answers would be “not at all” and “in no way,” since the past has no power to impose itself, whereas the historian is a human agent capable of initiating almost anything. But the question becomes more meaningful when a specific social context is posited. Thus a philosophical question leads to a different answer when posed sociologically. How much and in what ways do the material remains of the past affect the historian who works in a scholarly community whose principal task is to reconstruct, interpret, and preserve artifacts from the past? In this cultural milieu the practitioners of history are constrained by a complex set of rules. Within a society committed to accuracy in representations of the past, the preservation of evidence imposes definite limits to the factual assertions that can be made; it even sets up boundaries around the range of interpretations that can be offered about an event or development.

There are limits, however, even to the efficacy of rules; they cannot discriminate among interpretations that rest on different assumptions. Let’s take the examples of a historian who concludes that the American Revolution happened because colonial leaders construed the new British tax measures as efforts to curtail their colonies’ self-governing traditions and another scholar who is convinced that colonial merchants and farmers resisted British authority in order to protect the profitability of their firms and farms. Material remains from the past cannot resolve the disparity between these two interpretations because they start from different assessments of the interests, values, and motivations of the principal actors. Indeed, the two historians would use a different scale for weighing the influential actions of the participants themselves—be they legislators, pamphleteers, or entrepreneurs.

For some of history’s critics, the presence of different interpretations suggests the impossibility of validating historical knowledge. The very existence of a variety of witnesses and partisans in past events is evoked in arguments to make the skeptic’s point. Differences of perspective, however, should be distinguished from different interpretations. The two explanations given for the causes of the American Revolution reflect different assessments of human motives and social action and could only be reconciled, if at all, by extensive debate. Historians’ interpretations can be mutually exclusive, but their differing perspectives are not. If one sees an event from a slave’s point of view, that rendering does not obliterate the perspective of the slaveholder; it only complicates the task of interpretation.

Taking the metaphor of perception literally helps make the point. Perspective does not mean opinion; it refers to point of view—literally, point from which something, an object outside the mind, is viewed. Let’s imagine witnesses to a violent argument arrayed around the room where it took place. The sum of their vantage points would give a fuller picture, but the action they were witnessing would not be changed because there were many people watching it. Unless they were standing in each other’s way, the perspectives would not be mutually exclusive; nor could the multiplication of perspectives affect the viewers. The validity of each reconstruction would depend upon the accuracy and completeness of the observations, not on the perspective itself. Objectivity remains with the object. As one contemporary philosopher trenchantly put it, “Objectivity does not require taking God’s perspective, which is impossible.”9

Genealogists, antiquarians, and chroniclers share the historian’s concern with the past, but the differences among them help clarify the role of interpretation in the historians’ work. Genealogists, as the word suggests, search the past for the carriers of a specific genetic endowment. They follow human beings backward as they exponentially collect forebears—two parents, four grandparents, etc. They labor to gather the vital statistics of a specific family. Chroniclers take each day at a time, recording events from the immediate perspective of the moment past. Antiquarians range more widely, but their abiding passion is for things that are old. They love the past in the raw, as it were, unmediated by analysis or interpretation. Curiosity stays fixed to the something that is old whether it is a battlefield or a set of china. With all of them, the historical imagination never sails beyond the object to the larger social universe that produced it. Antiquarians preserve, chroniclers record, and genealogists trace. Historians aim at more. They share with all these others an orientation toward the past as an object of curiosity, yet also seek significance, explanation, and meaning, a triumvirate of intellectual entailments that has exposed their work to the radiating skepticism of the age.

Postmodernists have collapsed the tension between the conviction that objects have an integrity that can sustain itself through external investigation and the awareness of the snares and delusions that accompany efforts to make sense of objective reality. As Carlo Ginzburg has put it, they have turned evidence into a “wall which by definition precludes any access to reality.” The postmodernist critics of historical objectivity have made “knowing the past completely” so fixed a concept that they have had to rely on a “sort of inverted positivism” to press their case against historians.10 The full unknowability of a past event becomes the only real thing in contrast to which the imaginative effort to reassemble a picture of past reality from the remaining fragments appears pathetic. It is a rhetorical exaggeration that calls to mind William James’s retort to an insistent disputant at one of his lectures: “Madam, I cannot allow your ignorance however great to take precedence over my knowledge however small.”

Knowledge of the past, however small, begins with memory. Because people have a memory, they know from experience that there was a past, although it should be noted that an important philosophical tradition associated with David Hume denies the knowability of things outside ourselves, even of memory as an indicator of past experiences. Taking the more commonsensical view of the reality of objects, we credit memory with the verification of there having been a past.11 History fulfills a fundamental human need by reconstituting memory. Memory sustains consciousness of living in the stream of time, and the amour proper of human beings cries out for the knowledge of their place in that stream. Westerners have learned how to externalize this curiosity about the past. They even distance themselves from its impertinent subjectivity by directing questions to such objects as the rise of the nation-state or the impact of the printing press, but the renewable source of energy behind these inquiries comes from the intense craving for insight into what it is to be human. Thus memory that has been trained to seek an objective verification of the past is nevertheless inextricably tied up with the powerful personal longings of all who write or tell histories.

A convincing case for the qualified objectivity we advocate must come to terms with the undeniable elements of subjectivity, artificiality, and language dependence in historical writing. We have redefined historical objectivity as an interactive relationship between an inquiring subject and an external object. Physical scientists validate their work through the external process of experimentation. Many social scientists attempt to imitate them by reducing their questions to phenomena explicable by survey data, experimentation with laboratory animals, or other external tests. Historians cannot similarly rely on external validation because they seek to understand the internal dispositions of historical actors: what motivated them, how they responded to events, which ideas shaped their social world. Such understandings depend upon convincing, well-documented and coherently argued interpretations that link internally generated meanings to external behavior.

Having talked about remembering and believing in the transactions between the historian and the past, we want also to consider the role of curiosity. Knowledge is above all the accumulation of answers to questions that curious men and women have asked about the physical and social worlds they encounter. History is crucially distinguished from fiction by curiosity about what actually happened in the past. Beyond the self—outside the realm of the imagination—lies a landscape cluttered with the detritus of past living, a melange of clues and codes informative of a moment as real as this present one. When curiosity is stirred about an aspect of this past, a relationship with an object has begun.

Objects can be tough to abandon, for they exist. The very objectiveness of objects—their failure to accommodate all interpretations—helps explain why scholars quarrel among themselves. The skeptic says that the quarreling is proof of subjective perspectives. We’re inclined to think it attributable to the commanding and often unyielding presence of those objects which people seek to incorporate into their world of understanding. In the West, natural philosophers were the first to grapple in disciplined ways with the otherness of objects around them—think of Newton in his alchemical moments, sitting in his Cambridge laboratory trying to turn an ordinary metal into gold. Like science, objectivity in history began with curiosity about the otherness of the past.

As long as people assumed that those in the past were essentially like them, there was little curiosity about the past itself and little sense that past societies were as different from their own as a foreign country. The fact that curiosity about objects is a deeply personal response produces the conundrum that objective investigations begin with the subjective curiosity of an inquirer. Having made subjectivity itself an object of investigation, theorists in recent years now claim to have revealed the fallacy of objective knowledge. Because positivists ignored the undeniable subjectivity of the sentient beings who alone initiate all scientific inquiries, they had set up a straw man just waiting to be pushed over once the cultural cloak of awe draped over science had been lifted. Realists now must think more deeply about the nature of the relationship between a curious, imaginative, culturally shaped investigator and the passive objects under investigation. Objects arouse curiosity, resist implausible manipulation, and collect layers of information about them. Objectivity can only refer to a relationship between persons and these fascinating things; it cannot reside outside of persons. Any standards of objectivity we erect must focus on that relationship.

Heroic science went wrong by grounding objectivity upon value-free, neutral experimentation. The notion of objectivity inherited from the scientific revolution made it sound as if the researcher went into a trance, cleared his mind, polished the mind’s mirror, and trained it on the object of investigation. Of course, there were methods to be followed, but the beliefs, values, and interests that defined the researcher as a person were simply brushed aside in this depiction to allow the mirror to capture the reflection of nature’s storehouse of wonders. The positivists simply developed too restricted a definition of objectivity. We have redefined historical objectivity as an interactive relationship between an inquiring subject and an external object. Validation in this definition comes from persuasion more than proof, but without proof there is no historical writing of any worth.





Psychological Dynamics of Knowing



In exploring how memory affects the writing of history, we have drawn attention to the psychological need for comprehending experience which calls for accuracy, as well as the human drive for personal recognition that encourages myth-making. Either can come into play, whether the product is a study of constitutional law or a biography. What this book insists upon is the human capacity to discriminate between false and faithful representations of past reality and, beyond that, to articulate standards which help both practitioners and readers to make such discriminations. Here the crucial relationship between the creators of knowledge and their critics enters in. When we say that the memory of the past or the objects left over from past living restrain historians, we are not saying that all people submit themselves to the discipline of studying evidence. The contemporary example of the bogus scholars who say there was no Holocaust painfully demonstrates the contrary. Rather we are pointing to the fact that history-writing and history-reading are a shared enterprise in which the community of practitioners acts as a check on the historian just as Newton’s experiments on moving objects and Darwin’s observations of fossils constrained what they could say.

Historians’ questions turn the material remains from the past into evidence, for evidence is only evidence in relation to a particular account. (Think of the detective who notices a telltale streak of shoe polish on a doorjamb; a perfectly ordinary trace of passage becomes a clue.) But once a story is told, an argument made, or an interpretation advanced, the objects that compose the supporting evidence come under scrutiny. Evidence adduced to an explanation can never be kept secret in a society that prizes historical knowledge, and it is the accessibility of evidence in publicly supported archives, libraries, and museums that sustains the historical consciousness of this culture. An audience of peers derives its power from equal access to the evidence and to publication, a reminder that democratic practices have an impact far beyond the strictly political. They permit replicability and testing, honest and often stormy controversy.

The bits and pieces of records left from the past can be arranged into different and contending pictures. To be more direct, since human society is composed of relationships, many of them carrying implications of power and elements of concealment, one’s point of entry into a past moment will always affect one’s findings. No workable definition of objectivity can hide the likelihood that students of the human past will always have to deal with more than one version of what has happened. The fact that there can be a multiplicity of accurate histories does not turn accuracy into a fugitive from a more confident age; it only points to the expanded necessity of men and women to read the many messages packed into a past event and to follow their different trajectories as that event’s consequences concatenate through time.





Narratives and Language



The human intellect demands accuracy while the soul craves meaning. History ministers to both with stories. Postmodernist critics delight in pointing out that historical narratives are actually a literary form without any logical connection to the seamless flow of happenings that constitute living. Again, summoning memory, we can concur. The routines and occasions we experience follow one another without interruption. It is only when we begin to tell another about them that a story emerges. Indeed, the very idea of an event or development depends upon already having such concepts to describe the passage of time. Western histories are embedded in a matrix of cultural properties like those of progressive development or cycles of degeneration, to speak of the regnant ideas of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The storytelling voice and arrangement of incidents into a narrative are but the most familiar of these. Personal interpretive assumptions guide historians as they compose their stories, but it is only in contrast to an image of historians’ mirroring the past that this fact raises doubts about the enterprise. To deny the writing of history objective validity because of the historian’s essential creative effort is to remain attached to a nineteenth-century understanding of the production of knowledge.

While philosophers and literary critics in recent years have exposed the artificial status of narrative, they have also given narrative form an attention which has enhanced appreciation for it. The flow of time does not have a beginning, middle, and end; only stories about it do. Yet lives share the structure of narratives, and perhaps a familiarity with their beginnings, middles, and ends predisposes people to cast their histories into narrative form. Historians should attend to the pervasive appeal of stories. Just think of the awakening of interest that comes with the start of a tale; even the body relaxes at the sound of “In the beginning, Omaha was run by cattle men,” or “Let me tell you how Joan came to buy that house.”

The fascinating thing about telling stories is that they start with the end. It is a conclusion that arouses our curiosity and prompts us to ask a question, which then leads back to the beginning from which the eventual outcome unwound. A happy relationship goes on the rocks. The unhappy finale becomes the starting point for searching questions. To explain the breakup of what once was whole, a story is told, and every element in the ensuing narrative will carry with it a clue about its conclusion. It is the perception of a closure or outcome to a string of occurrences that first starts people asking questions, which then guide them toward relevant facts. The Cold War’s half century of frozen immobility ended in a thaw. In China, the Statue of Liberty briefly graced Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Germany recomposed itself into its earlier national entity. Yugoslavia has disaggregated into warring ethnic factions. All these recent and unexpected happenings provoked new questions, and from them will come new histories of this century.

This impulse to tell new stories points up that time itself is a perspective. Nineteenth-century men and women posed different questions about the settling of the trans-Mississippi plains than are currently brought to the subject. They called it the westward movement, kept their eyes glued to the white “pioneers,” and sought out those incidents that explained the fulfillment of America’s continental destiny. Contemporaries now have located the Plains Indians on the landscape along with those Mexicans whose homes had been rudely denationalized by war. The presence of these groups powerfully shapes the imaginative recreation of the territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific, prompting consideration of the multiple encounters with others involved in the westward trek of black and white Americans.

Distance and changes of sensibility regularly open up novel lines of inquiry as boredom and irrelevance close others. Through most periods of our national existence, slavery was too acutely embarrassing a subject to permit historians to probe its origins in colonial Virginia. Nor was much research done on the work routines, the housing, and the family lives of slaves until the atrocities of World War II shocked scholars into exploring the origins of American race prejudice. Soon African-Americans entered the academic profession, changing forever the limited perspective of their Euro-American colleagues. With different time periods as with the diverse vantage points, the past as an object of curiosity changes, and so do the stories told about it.

The written word preserves the histories told; time makes those words obsolete. Because historical accounts always explain the meaning of events in terms relevant to the immediate audience, curiosity about the past is inextricably bound up in the preoccupations of the present. The past as an object will be read differently from one generation to another. Nineteenth-century Southern defenders of slavery when writing about the causes of secession placed their facts in an altogether different context from that of twentieth-century historians who connect the Civil War with the momentous accomplishment of abolishing slavery. Or, to take another example, historians, no longer believing that women are incapacitated for public life, now read older prescriptions of their natural domesticity with a degree of skepticism, if not anger. The very plausibility of a historical account, dependent as it is upon the interpretive interlarding of values, will always be subject to change.

Skeptics count this constant reassessing of the past against history’s claim to objectivity, whereas it can better be considered testimony to the urgency each generation feels to possess the past in terms meaningful to it. The incontrovertible existence of various interpretations of past events by no means proves the relativist’s case, but it certainly demands that everyone shed the positivist’s notion of historical truth. If the past was simply composed of material objects or recordable actions, one good “snapshot” of it could capture the essential contours for all eternity. Happily, it is the human experience both in the past and the present which compels attention.

Successive generations of scholars do not so much revise historical knowledge as they reinvest it with contemporary interest. Each generation’s inquiries about the past actually carry forward the implications of its predecessors’ learning. New versions of old narratives are not arbitrary exercises of historical imagination, but the consequence of the changing interest from cumulative social experience. If history did not involve a relationship with an object outside the self, it would have no capacity to extend the range of human understanding; its disclosures would only be reflections of ideas already known. The Dutch historian Peter Geyl commented that all history is an interim report, but he would not have denied that within those interim reports were residues of research that would be studied long after the interim of the report had passed.





The Textuality of Texts



The difference between oral and written traditions is critical to the consideration of objectivity. When storytellers narrate in person, they can change the details or modify their meaning every time they give a rendition of their story. An oral tradition is almost always the work of successive retellings of a past event, each narrator transmitting and refashioning the tales that form the collective memory. In written history, the text itself becomes an object with properties of its own. Preserved in an unvarying form, it freezes in time one rendition that can disclose over time just how meaning and the words that convey meaning have changed. Written histories permit—even compel—readers in one age to take stock of the distance they’ve moved from their forebears. These confrontations, more than anything else, have deepened an understanding of the interpretive element in historical writing, reinforcing the strength of the link between present and past.

When written history takes over from memory, as we have noted, it creates an object—a text—which itself invites external examination. Unlike the stories told by balladeers or the oral traditions kept alive in small communities, written histories are exposed to the critical scrutiny of unknown, unseen outsiders. Since at least the seventeenth century the histories written by Europeans or Euro-Americans have been subjected to intense criticism, but it is only with the postmodernists that the probing scalpel of the expert has cut through the histories to the words that compose them.

In analyzing texts, postmodernists have made two linked assertions. First, texts—a word which ranges far beyond the meaning of a piece of writing to include any element of culture—conceal as much as they express and must not be read literally or solely with an eye to recovering the authors’ intentions. Instead they must be deconstructed, which means locating the blanks, gaps, and interruptions of thought or plot which, once found, will bring to light the contradictions, inversions, and secrets embedded in the text. Writing, for the postmodernists, bristles with perversity, reflecting the bad faith and hidden agendas within a given culture. Secondly, they insist that the fact that a given text can be read so many different ways proves that there is no stability to language. Hence the authors don’t exercise any control over the reader’s imaginative reconstruction of their words. Decoupling these central contentions of postmodernism is profoundly important, for the benefits to be derived from their first insight must be separated from the exaggerated skepticism about the stability of language in the second.

To interrogate a text is to open up the fullness of meaning within. Everyone uses language largely unaware of the cultural specificity of words, the rules and protocols of expression, the evasions in their euphemisms, the nuances from group associations, or the verbal detours imposed by social taboos. When an astute reader points out these intriguing elements in a text, our understanding of what is being communicated, both intentionally and unintentionally, is vastly increased. The fact that authors do not intend all that they say does not render their intentions uninteresting or irrelevant; it merely highlights the subterranean quality of many of the influences that play upon word choices.

The stability of language is a different matter. Building on Ferdinand de Saussure’s insight that words change their meanings in relation to other words, linguists have described languages as internal systems rather than organizations of referents to an outside world. Postmodernists have gone one step further and given a new fluidity to words by denying that there is any bonding between the word signifier and the object signified. Without this bonding, they say, it is theoretically possible to have an infinite number of meanings to any sentence. With rapturous playfulness, they have spoken of words dancing, cascading, colliding, escaping, deceiving, hiding, leaving less imaginative word users to wonder why they bother with them at all.

Once again, the true situation has been overdichotomized. Words rarely separate from their conventional referents, nor are they glued to them either. Their adhesion to a definition is more like Velcro, strong enough to stick if undisturbed, but not so strong that social usage can’t peel them off for reattachment elsewhere. To lavish all one’s attention on the possibility of personal inventiveness on the part of those reading a text to the neglect of the probability of shared understanding of words is to distort the reality. Worse than this distortion is the fact that this emphasis obscures the more important fact that people living at the same time construct their own lexicons. Words change meaning in response to experience; shared experience creates a shared language. Far from exercising individual idiosyncrasies in reading, a community of readers will build up a strong consensus on meaning.

Still, language presents problems for historians, particularly those unwilling to acknowledge the code-making propensities of human groups and the use of those codes to distinguish insiders from outsiders. Because words can change their meaning without changing their visual representation—the word “freedom” always looks the same even though its import has varied dramatically over the centuries—the historical text should be addressed as a puzzle. Its expressions will certainly be read differently by successive generations, but the survival of its material integrity guarantees that someone’s curiosity about its original meaning will be provoked.

With this stronger, more self-reflexive and interactive sense of objectivity, historians are more likely to submit to the rules of evidence. Recognizing that everyone is situated, hence embedded in a cultural perspective, they can use that perspective as a foil against which to project the particularities of the age being studied. Standing firmly in the place that heritage and experience have put them, inquirers into the past can use their self-understanding to probe the past with imagination. They can be “finite, embodied, and fragile” and still seek and find knowledge.12 The telescope of an inquiring mind that they train on objects may later seem concave or convex, at moments fogged, even cracked, in constant need of repair, but it remains an operational tool. Knowing that there are objects out there turns scholars into practical realists. They can admit their cultural fixity, their partial grasp of truth, and still think that in trying to know the world it’s best not to divert the lens from the object—as the relativist suggests—but to leave it on and keep trying to clean it.

Americans keep telling themselves that they are a pragmatic lot, eager to judge methods by their results. This has led to an instrumental approach to life, a tendency captured in a bill-board depicting a happy group with the caption “The family that prays together stays together.” The profundity of sacred worship is thus reduced to the utility of staying out of divorce court. In this book, we have avoided utilitarian arguments in our defense of objectivity because we think that they trivialize the important issues skeptics have raised. If it is possible to create knowledge, then one believes it because reason compels one; no list of good consequences can redeem the falseness of a proposition. This being said, it is not amiss to point out the benefits of a shared commitment to objective knowledge. It forces people to examine rigorously the relation between what they bring to their subject and what they find; it undergirds methodological rules that facilitate debate; it encourages people to perform the arduous tasks of knowledge-seeking. Edward Leigh Mallory said that he climbed Mount Everest because it was there; historians carry their laptop computers up the three hundred stone steps in Lyon because records from the past are there. From that conviction of their knowability, knowledge grows.

Both the promise and the problems of history spring from its linkage to memory. The promise is memory’s validation of the objective reality of the past. The experience of remembering underpins the belief that the past existed and hence makes possible, even imperative, an effort to reconstruct what happened. At the same time, the personal craving for meaning which memory serves also fosters the temptation to use history to inflate reputations, deny past cruelties, dispense comfort, and rationalize actions. It is exactly the psychological potency of written history that makes it so important to nations. Just as memory in all its visible and invisible forms sustains personal identity, so national memory, kept alive through history, confers a group identity upon a people, turning association into solidarity or legitimating the coercive authority of the state. Milan Kundera has said that the struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting. As a novelist, Kundera conceived this contest as a conflict between the independent witness and the official manipulators of evidence. For historians the struggle of memory against forgetting also involves power, but with them it requires the power to resist the debilitating doubts that the past is knowable, that the forgetting is about something real.
