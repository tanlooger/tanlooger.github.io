title: 8 The Future of History
---







TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HISTORY pivots around the question of how best to deploy the passion to know. Focusing that passion is the investigators’ belief that the past can reveal an aspect of what it is to be human. The desire to touch the past is a yearning to master time, to anchor oneself in worldliness, to occupy fully one’s own historical context by studying its antecedents. Given the immediacy of human passion, the present is always implicated in the study of the past. Lived experience alters the questions historians ask, foreclosing some research agendas while inspiring new ones. This sensitivity of historians to the lived moment is particularly visible at times of deep and significant historical change such as the world is witnessing now.

The Cold War riveted international affairs to the foreign policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. For almost a half century, it determined identities, magnified anxieties, and permeated every intellectual enterprise. All that has now abruptly ended. The future of history, like the future of much else in the world, can now be imagined in markedly different ways. A new republic of learning is possible because bunkerlike positions staked out on the treacherous landscape of battle can be abandoned, because old absolutisms have fallen, taking down with them many of the absolutist elements within Western democracies. New thinking is possible, even required. A part of this new thinking will include a return to the intellectual center of the Western experience since the seventeenth century, to scientific knowledge and its philosophical foundations, revitalized and reconceptualized.





History and Science After the Cold War



If recent controversies are any indication, there will be great reluctance to moving into the imaginative space opened by the collapse of Cold War empires and ideologies. Throughout the globe, for forty years, rigid categories of right and left have polarized all thinking about society both between nations and within those societies where free speech was tolerated. Frontiers of thought, so long patrolled by muscular ideologues, will not now be easily crossed even though the guards have been retired. Because the conflict was waged as vigorously with ideas as with guns, people will continue policing their minds long after the threat of attack has subsided.

The resistance to occupying the newly opened spaces can be seen on both the right and the left in the United States, but it has been especially forthright among those defenders of the status quo whom we will call traditionalists. Rallying with a fresh sense of urgency to a new set of threats to their America, these critics have mobilized opposition to an array of educational initiatives. Lumping postmodernism, multiculturalism, and even social history together as one large target, they have taken the offensive against these designated left-wing enthusiasms. Even though they have identified some real weaknesses in postmodernism, they have moved beyond target practice to an all-out war on multiculturalism and the democratization of the university. In the New York Times an advertisement by the National Association of Scholars catalogued the objectionable features of current school curriculum reform. The list included the addition to students’ required reading of more works by women and minorities; the introduction of “issues of race, gender, and class” into courses; the development of women’s and minority studies; and the adoption of undergraduate course requirements in women’s or minority studies.1

In combating these innovations, the NAS has wrapped itself in the tattered mantle of scientific objectivity, criticizing the diversification of the curriculum because it is polemical, that is, strongly urged by an interested group. Any alteration of the curriculum in response to contemporary needs or pressures would presumably be polemical, by this definition. Adopting a stance of neutrality, the organization has argued that “‘multicultural education’ should not take place at the expense of studies that transcend cultural differences,” like mathematics, the sciences, and history, which do not, they say, vary for “people of different races, sexes or cultures.”2 Linking history with the sciences and the sciences with mathematics and all of them with the transcendence of value-free objectivity, of course, is itself a polemical tactic in that old cultural war which has engaged scholars since the eighteenth century. These claims for the eternal pertinence of certain truths cannot be taken at face value. By characterizing as political those who would revise inherited courses and canons, traditionalists are trying to protect the school curricula from contemporary scrutiny, using the dead hand of the past, in this instance, to muzzle the voices of the present.

The threat of cultural relativism has encouraged the traditionalists to find similarities among all the programs they dislike and to unify their efforts as a campaign to defend the old status quo. According to them, universities now “expel” Homer, Aristotle, and Shakespeare from their required courses, because professors no longer believe in standards. The language of politics pervades the traditionalists’ rhetoric. Academic leaders, they charge, are cravenly pandering to the rising number of minority and women students when they replace the epic poems of Homer with stories from a Guatemalan Indian woman. These willful destroyers of a venerable Western curriculum, so the argument goes, are embracing the view that all cultural values are of equal merit. Implicit in the demands for both a broadened curriculum and a diversified faculty, according to one of the traditionalists, “is a denial of the ability of scholarship to make any meaningful distinctions between valid and invalid claims.”3 Even more exercised by the non-Western readings introduced in college courses, political scientist Thomas Pangle has described the minds of the authors of the newly assigned texts as “enserfed to the self-hating intellectual frameworks concocted by European leftists of the postwar period.”4

Traditionalists maintain that cultural relativism and its logical entailment, moral nihilism, now dominate the university, thanks to the combined influence of postmodernism, affirmative action, and curricular reforms. The universities have been seized by “arrogant and often philistine critics who treat the works of the past as a pathologist treats the corpses of the carriers of a plague.”5 These “philistine critics,” traditionalists allege, are filled with venomous hatred of Western civilization. Worse, they want to legislate equality rather than gain it through their own hard work. The “tenured radicals” who are reshaping the nation’s schools, according to this critique, have imperiled merit itself.

By deliberately stuffing affirmative action, curricular reform, and various strands of philosophical skepticism into one kit bag, traditionalists have adopted an offensive strategy that bears striking resemblances to the ideological marching orders of the Cold War. They have exaggerated the influence of postmodernists within American universities and created a new national bogey in the form of political correctness. When they write, as Pangle has, about “the debilitating relativism that now seeps its poison through the mass consciousness of the Western democracies” and link it with a recommendation of the teachings of Pope John Paul II “and everything he stands for,” the fear arises that “debilitating relativism” may take the place of communism as the necessary enemy in a resurgence of Cold War bellicosity.6

The workings of Cold War logic can be seen most clearly in Dinesh D’Souza’s Illiberal Education, which explicitly links the decision by an American university to recruit postmodernist faculty members to affirmative action policies because both undermine “the notion of standards of merit.”7 Searching for scholars with a particular expertise is thus linked to a decline in the commitment to excellence, which in turn is characterized as the inevitable consequence of reforming the traditional curriculum and seeking an ethnically diverse faculty. In his rendering, postmodernism is attached, like a clanking tin can, to the tail of multiculturalism, a term now standing in for a variety of changes in American education. If postmodernists are red, the multiculturalists are pink, the cultural relativists mauve, and all seek to color our perceptions of the achievements of Western culture.

Like a long line of postwar ideologues of both right and left, the traditionalists are themselves guilty of faulty logic. They use the most extreme views of some postmodernists to disparage all critics of the status quo. They take the most ill-advised pronouncements of curricular reformers to represent the entire effort to democratize the university. They claim to support freedom, but in fact preach an updated form of absolutism where scientific neutrality transcends human agency. They appear to stand for greater openness, yet actually they are demanding a return to the old days when truth was absolute and dissent adjudicated by those like themselves.

In time of war, one attacks; in time of peace, one tries to find a common ground. Marxism, liberalism, and even postmodernism, which initially offered a third way, became weapons of thought control rather than tools of analysis because the Cold War politicized all social thought. Of course, the categories of left and right are far older than the Cold War, so battle lines can easily be reestablished along new borders, if public commentators are more intent on fighting than thinking. Their heirs will enjoy the promise of peace only if the habits of war can be abandoned.

Although this book has argued against the contention that history, science, and all efforts at generalizing truth have ended in failure, as the postmodernists assert and the traditionalists fear, it did begin with the premise that a great transformation has recently occurred in Western thinking about knowledge. This transformation—accelerated by the end of the Cold War—affects Americans’ understanding of national history, of standards of truth and objectivity, of the practice of history and the human sciences in general. As the twentieth century closes, it becomes obvious that new definitions of truth and objectivity are needed in every field of knowledge. People today are rightly questioning those values of nineteenth-century science that accompanied the institutionalization of history along with the facile equating of modernity with progress.

Where relativists and traditionalists have both gone wrong is in their analysis of the nature of the crisis. The chief cause of the present crisis of knowledge is the collapse on all fronts of intellectual and political absolutism. Just as totalitarian governments continue to crumble everywhere on the globe in favor of democratic polities, so too are absolute claims to knowledge giving way to the recognition of the multiplicity of points of view and their importance in generating knowledge. In a profound sense, burying the belief that definitions of knowledge about humankind can be fixed unconditionally is as important to democracy as the removal of autocratic rulers.

Having the opportunity to examine the enterprise of truth-seeking in history without the straitjacket imposed by the Cold War lowers the stakes for ideologues on both right and left. It does not, however, render the search any less compelling. In the past, most truths in the intellectual traditions of the modern West, whether about nature or society, were couched in scientific language. Until well into this century science conjured up in the public imagination truths that were both immensely comforting and morally reassuring. Although few today doubt that science embodies ever greater power as it continues to demonstrate mastery over nature, most Westerners question its automatic contribution to progress. Rightly they fear the military uses to which Western science has been put, and they recoil from the ease with which scientists have served odious regimes. Late in the twentieth century the word “scientific” conveys power without the assurance of benevolence.

In the 1940s, as a result of the struggle to defeat Nazism, science became one of the mainstays of the militarized state. On an unprecedented scale, science entered war service. Despite the postwar warnings of scientists and statesmen like James Conant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose presidential farewell address in 1961 spoke ominously of the emergent power of the “military-industrial complex,” the scientific establishment retained its ties to the defense establishment. University after university, laboratory after laboratory, coveted federal funds. With the defense buildup of the 1980s, military research and development spending exceeded (in constant dollars) the levels of the mid-1960s.8 Even the discipline of physics, once regarded as the most theoretical, abstract, and hence value-free of all the scientific disciplines, became useful in unprecedented ways, with the bulk of its practitioners working on military technologies in the service of national security.9

With this linkage of science and war-making, a precious piece of the past that had been forgotten now needs to be remembered. The Enlightenment campaign to replace clerical learning with scientific knowledge bequeathed the legacy that all intellectual inquiry be open, free, and secular. These became the preconditions for truth-seeking. In the eighteenth century, reformers carved out a public arena in which the arts and sciences could flourish, a space between the domain of official authority and the privacy of the family. Speaking for the first time through voluntary associations that included scientific societies, reading clubs, salons, reform associations, and masonic lodges, members of a newly constituted, yet restricted, literate public eagerly addressed the issues of the day. They read, conversed, learned, and applied their new critical faculties through pamphlets, tracts, and novels to problems as pressing as the power of oligarchies and the corruption of courts. Novelists, journalists, publishers, clandestine writers—money-hungry as well as idealistic—created a new realm physically situated in drawing rooms as well as coffee houses. Their ideals of openness might sometimes have been more honored in the breach, but they promoted advances from the original application of mechanics to the environmental reform movements of the present. Because of these humane underpinnings, the practice of science—indeed, of all intellectual life—could be imagined as a form of virtuous living. Freedom to read and think prepared the ground for other freedoms—for constitutions, charters, declarations of rights—without which no one amid the repressions and injustices of their world could ever have imagined freedom or endorsed equality.

Nothing could be further from the contemporary image of science, shaped as it has been by national sites shrouded in secrecy and screened by security clearances. Cold War censors, tyrants, and spies have systematically whittled away the Enlightenment legacy when they have not actually tried to destroy it. Beating back their efforts has required a constant struggle. All from Andrei Sakharov to underfunded teachers in urban schools are victims of that struggle, and all have a stake in ensuring the expansion of knowledge open to public scrutiny. Critics of contemporary science have also exposed the appalling neglect of women’s scientific training and the gender bias of Western science’s rhetoric and research agendas. Still other, principally non-Western, critics have pointed out the disinclination of Western scientists to learn from other systems of knowledge.10 These aspects of contemporary reality make it harder to reinvent a new republic of learning in the aftermath of the Cold War. The legacy of Cold War science also helps to explain the cynicism, even nihilism, and certainly the intellectual relativism, that greet even the mention of truth and objectivity.

Yet while no one would wish, or indeed be able, to go back to the nineteenth-century absolutist understanding of what it is to be scientific, most scholars in the human and natural sciences still wish to recognize some distinctive benefits derived from the Scientific Revolution. Most scientists and philosophers of science continue to be realists of a sort—that is, they think that experimental methods and theoretical statements, while often in tension with each other, capture enough about nature to be close to what is there.11 The investigations of social scientists still have a lot to do with those of the natural scientist. All are bound in time and done within a particular social context: all select evidence for examination, and all are in need of constant reform because their practitioners can impose biases of gender, class, and culture. All can produce workable truths and in the case of science those truths can also be lawlike in their replicability and predictability. Despite these original similarities, during the past fifty years science has come to be seen as radically different from humanistic inquiry. If funding and prestige were the sole determinants of truth-seeking, ’tis little wonder.

Scholars who work in archives, libraries, and oral history laboratories far from material nature need to resist the temptation to accept a radical divorce from scientific methods. Doing so will be easier if historians, philosophers, and scientists recognize that the problem of truth—finding any, getting agreement that you have it, and then someday having to revise it—has been immensely complicated by the Cold War and more precisely by the role that what is called Big Science played in the service of the military-industrial complex from 1945 onward. To say that physics is just too sophisticated and complicated does not adequately explain the distance, even hostility, that has now developed between scientific knowledge and learning about humanity and society. In identifying and examining these postwar developments, historical knowledge can be helpful.

Hope for the future republic of learning derives from the capacity of the human sciences to offer criticism, both of natural science and of themselves. Historians and sociologists of science and technology are increasingly documenting the impact that the Cold War has had on the natural sciences. Just as physicians are never good at examining themselves, so historians may have difficulty assessing how the practice of history has also been affected by the ideological warfare of the past forty years. Indeed despairing of objectivity as an ideal may have a great deal to do with the fact that most historians now writing have spent all of their professional lives in the shadow of the Cold War. It is time to come out of the trenches.

The scholarship of the postwar generation has led to a thoroughly argued and historically grounded appreciation for the social construction of knowledge. Cynics have claimed that this approach to knowledge proves the omnipresence of ideologies, not truth, in all human learning. They fail to grasp the actual message that the social approach to knowledge formation offers—that all scientific work has an essentially social character. The system of peer review, open refereeing, public disputation, replicated experiments, and documented research—all aided by international communication and the extended freedom from censorship—makes objective knowledge possible. Research programs must be established and findings constantly tested. These involve social processes which leave traces to be encoded within the resulting knowledge, necessitating even more decoding of inherited knowledge.12 The official secrecy and mimetic authoritarian styles of big-money science further disfigure the state of the sciences just as surely as the retreat into relativism undermines the will to know in the human sciences. By declaring knowledge a by-product of each speaker’s situation, relativism turns every consensual group into a universe unto itself, while propagating the idea that truths just emerge from the place where one is coming from or the language one happens to use. It permits a mental segregation among researchers and a privileging of ironic discourse, an effect not so different from scientific publications that may only be read by people with security clearances.

If knowledge and the discourses it generates offer power, then the issue of access to it becomes vitally important. Just as the barriers to free access within science must now, urgently, be dismantled, so too the accessibility of history to the peoples of this nation must change. Far from diluting or distorting knowledge, democratic practices have toughened and seasoned the truths that have been generated since the eighteenth century. Demanding that all research be open recalls a part of Western history, the importance of the Enlightenment’s principal legacy, the freedom to communicate and the forum of civil society that makes truth possible.

History will flourish in a revitalized public arena. It will do so, we would suggest, because relativism and the intellectual postures that feed into it will recede, departing in the company of the alienation engendered by the rigidities of the Cold War. So too the traditionalist critics of the democratizing of the academy will increasingly sound like a background chorus singing old Cold War tunes.

Since the eighteenth century all Western reform movements have depended upon the existence of a relatively unfettered, uncensored domain of public discourse. In the seventeenth century every inch of that space had to be fought for, and only gradually was it wrested from the hands of clerical and governmental officials whose censorship silenced voices and stifled curiosity and wonder about nature and society. Scientific and technological knowledge prospered because of the struggle for freedom of press and association, but during the protracted Cold War, significant segments of scientific knowledge became the property of security agencies. Large areas of scientific learning were, and still are, configured by the need for defense and domination rather than humanitarian needs. This sequestering ironically has eased the move away from science as humanists have made the “linguistic turn.” The wonder that science once evoked in students has been replaced by boredom, suggesting that the authoritarian style of much science teaching may be traceable to Big Science and its postwar alliance with military needs.13

Mystifying, ignoring, decrying, or relativizing scientific knowledge makes trivial that which is central to Western cultures. Perhaps because of the development of the history of science as a separate field, general history teaching largely ignores the scientific realm of social life, that arena where people might still display their wonder about nature and their efforts to satisfy an aroused scientific curiosity. The size of the gap between science and the humanities operates as an obstacle to the renewal of both. Leaving the history of specialized bodies of knowledge to a variety of subdisciplines may work for the history of music or art—although there too, general historical knowledge loses a vital piece of the human spirit—but consigning science and technology to that status in this particular culture severs a tap root. Teaching science to examine its biases as well as its truths, its arrogance as well as its elegance, would enrich the public as well as scientists and humanists because both participate in similar systems of knowledge construction and both are utterly dependent upon the vitality of civil society for the rigor, originality, and competitiveness of their theories and practices. Similarly, where democratic ideals and practices have faltered in either the community of the arts or that of the sciences, their critics rightly sound the alarm and proclaim the need for renewal within the republic of learning.





Pragmatism, Practical Reason, and the Public Realm



The democratic practice of history here advocated needs a philosophical grounding compatible with its affirmations. We find that grounding in a combination of practical realism and pragmatism, that is, in an epistemological position that claims that people’s perceptions of the world have some correspondence with that world and that standards, even though they are historical products, can be made to discriminate between valid and invalid assertions.14 The intellectual spirit of democratic scholarship celebrates a multiplicity of actors, diversely situated and skeptical of authority. They are seekers of a workable truth communicable within an improvable society. Sometimes the public might even venerate its scientists and savants, considering their accomplishments the work of sheer genius, but this would not put them off-limits to searching examination or historical analysis.

Within Western philosophical traditions sympathetic to democracy only pragmatism promotes the criticism and debate, dissent and irreverence vital to the kind of history we are advocating, yet pragmatism makes a distinction we consider crucial: all knowledge can be provisional, in theory, without eliminating the possibility of some truths prevailing for centuries, perhaps forever. And one of the responsibilities of history is to record both the survival and reformulation of old truths.

Pragmatism has been available as an approach to learning since the 1860s when Charles Peirce published a now classic set of papers. As discussed in the preceding chapter, Peirce laid out a philosophy of mind that emphasized the empirical as the very foundation for rationality. Here empiricism stands for systematic investigation and rigorous experimentation, confident of the objectivity of the objects of analysis. The past easily qualifies as one such object insofar as it resides in the artifacts that survive from it. The no-holds-barred approach of the pragmatist permits any claim about any object to be questioned, but rejects the relativism inherent in questioning all claims on principle. Its measured relativism springs from the knowledge of facts and theories that have failed to survive extended examination; it is not a philosophical position premised on categorical doubt. In addition, the pragmatist asks about the purpose of a knowledge claim. What goal will be achieved when modernity is debunked? If combined with dedication to the moral ends of action and a prophetic sense of the necessity for improvement, pragmatic empiricism can well serve a democratic agenda.

Pragmatism appealed to the great philosopher John Dewey, who embarked in the 1920s on a critical inspection of American education. In Dewey’s mind, pragmatism’s reliance upon the outcome of experiments to determine the truth of philosophical propositions supported the highest aspirations of democracy. Pragmatism’s passion for constantly reforming the aims and methods of scientific inquiry supported a liberal society’s moral obligation to develop and redevelop the fullest capacity of each member of society.

Practical realism works well with pragmatism, for both of these theories require a commitment to a knowable world outside, one which people experience as they check and alter what they say about it. Realists accept the objectivity of objects and consider the objects’ frequent resistance to accurate representations as an invitation to further investigation. Because pragmatism endorses the democratic practice of truth-seeking, it accepts the babel of tongues in the day-to-day practice of knowing, learning, and teaching. In this arena, objects and the inquiring subjects they attract help keep the playing field level because, while the struggle to establish a truth is being waged, no privileged perspectives are recognized. Rather than grounding truth on first principles, pragmatists make truth’s attainment a matter of self-correcting endeavors where any factual claim can be called into question, although not in the manner of the relativist who calls all propositions into question, all at once.

Because their notion of truth arises from a consensus of practitioners, pragmatists are exposed to tyranny from that group. What if the vast majority of investigators in a relevant field were to decide that all women are inferior or that one ethnic group failed to measure up to the standards of others? Pragmatism does not offer within its system of verification a formal set of criteria for determining that science directed to invidious distinctions is ultimately evil and frequently bunk. Indeed, pragmatism only works if democratic institutions are strong and functioning daily. Nor can the purpose to which knowledge is put be left to the decisions of any single group of knowledge seekers. Here the problem of exclusion bears directly on the fostering of relativism which occurs when any natural or social science is conducted in secrecy. If the playing field is restricted, leaving those excluded by virtue of race or class or gender to gape from the sidelines, then the pragmatic game devolves into entertainment for intellectuals, not the site for testing knowledge appropriate to the needs of a working democracy. With an absence of first principles, pragmatists can easily become relativists when the relevance of truth to the needs of society becomes more and more remote and anti-intellectual governments sponsor that remoteness.

For these reasons, pragmatism is only a provisional philosophy, but one that can be immensely useful for its endorsement of practice, verifiability, rationality, and progress achievable by reasonably well educated people. Pragmatism leaves unquestioned the consequences of the convergence of the popular will with the scientist’s drive for knowledge. Assuming a commonality of interests without demonstrating their existence, pragmatism depends on democracy. Hence pragmatism is implicated in democracy’s flaws, the principal one being exposure to the unchecked power of a majority when that majority acts capriciously.

This problem is as old as the American republic and has prompted a succession of astute observations about the nature of popular government. In his famous Federalist No. 10, James Madison set forth with wonderful clarity the dilemma of the majority being the greatest threat to its own political system. He began with factions, which he defined as groups acting against the rights of others or the long-term interests of the whole. Minority factions could be disruptive, but only majority factions, Madison shrewdly pointed out, could do mortal damage to republican government, for only they could seize control of the agencies of government. Two correctives to this threat presented themselves to Madison: elimination of the cause of majority faction or control of its effects. Naming freedom an essential component in the galvanizing of the passions and interests which animate majority faction, Madison rejected the idea of getting rid of the causes as a cure worse than the disease and concentrated instead upon managing its effects.15

Madison made the Constitution, then being considered for ratification, his solution to majority faction because it would enlarge the scope of national governance and thereby increase the number of interests in the nation, making it unlikely that any one group could command the unchecked force of a majority.16 Approaching politics as a predicament, the drafters of the Constitution were determined to erect barriers to the exercise of arbitrary power. Madison boldly proclaimed that “ambition must be made to check ambition.” It “may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary,” he continued, but “what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?”17 As weapons against abuses of power, resorts to ambition and competition have some justification, but they have also undermined Americans’ faith in a public arena where collective goals can be discussed.

Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting the United States in the 1830s, saw a different majoritarian threat from the one that had preoccupied the revolutionary generation. For him the unchecked power of the majority in the United States sapped the individual’s capacity to act independently by silently encouraging Americans to conform to majority taste, whether in ethics, in politics, or in philosophical views. Pervasive and invisible, Tocqueville’s tyranny of the majority worked on individuals with an efficacy unknown in absolute monarchies. Without knowing it—even while extolling their freedom and autonomy—Americans, Tocqueville observed, conformed to a limited range of aspirations, preferring the psychological comfort of equal treatment over the emotional risks of genuine independence from the herd.18

Both of these analyses bear on the problem of creating, testing, and spreading knowledge in a democracy. They also expose the risk present in pragmatism’s reliance upon the public to scrutinize the production of knowledge. Madison worried that majority factions could crush individual rights through the exercise of majority rule, and Tocqueville feared that majority opinion would eclipse the desire to soar beyond conventions, both results especially threatening to original scholarship. The history of American race relations amply supports their fears. White Americans have repeatedly acted as a majority faction toward blacks, using both informal violence and formal statutes to curtail the free exercise of their powers. At present a lesser threat to individual freedom has surfaced in the form of political correctness. Political correctness refers to a wall of sympathy raised to ward off challenges to policies directed at minorities. In an effort to protect minority students, some would declare off-limits debates that bear on issues affecting their concerns. Critics of “p.c.” have a point when they focus on the dangers of limiting public discussion, since the curtailment of spirited, open dissent threatens the very democratic practices that affirmative action was created to serve.

Political correctness patronizes people by assuming that their interests are too fragile for public scrutiny. Political pluralism sells them short by ignoring the deliberative component of democratic decision-making. Both aggravate the problems of nurturing knowledge in a democracy. By accepting the proposition that bargaining among separate interest groups determines public policy, pluralism legitimates the competition for public resources. It is relativism in action; “truth” belongs to the winners. Opposed to both is a conception of a republic where lawmakers are informed by particular needs, but attentive to the general well-being. Such a republic can only come into existence when there is a popular supportive ethic. As Madison’s and Tocqueville’s critiques indicate, despair at achieving a consensus about the good of the whole entered American discourse early. An even deeper skepticism about the concept of a public good, transcendent of the nation’s parts, pushed Americans toward the muscular masculinity of interest-group competition, a kind of arm-wrestling approach to politics which has stifled debate and limited public access for those without sufficient clout to push their way into the bargaining arena. Pragmatism, dependent as it is upon exhaustive testing of knowledge claims, has offered a reasoned support of public debate, but its deference to practice over principle has left democracy without an adequate defense against majority factions and majority tyrannies, not to mention the silent influence of well-financed interest groups.

Democracy and history always live in a kind of tension with each other. Nations use history to build a sense of national identity, pitting the demands for stories that build solidarity against open-ended scholarly inquiry that can trample on cherished illusions. Here the pressing question is which human needs should history serve, the yearning for a self-affirming past, even if distortive, or the liberation, however painful, that comes from grappling with a more complex, accurate account? Skepticism offers a way of resolving this tension by rejecting all truths, but in doing so it flies in the face of the common experience of knowing. Consider the outrage felt when a remembered experience is misrepresented. Where does this passionate sense of violation come from if truth is such a chameleon?

In important ways historians support the long-term goals of democratic societies when they insistently and honestly reconstruct past experience. They work for greater social inclusiveness because they bear witness to the records that have been suppressed. Having a history enables groups to get power, whether they use a past reality to affirm their rights or wrest recognition from those powerful groups that monopolize public debate. History doesn’t just reflect; it provides a forum for readjudicating power and interests. If historical accounts remain in some sense interim reports, it is because the meaning of human experience can never be exhausted.

A recent example of historical scholarship shaping public perceptions of a contemporary issue occurred when the Supreme Court deliberated on the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania abortion law in 1992. Then the court had at its disposal a short history of abortion in America which gave an account of responses to unwanted pregnancies spanning more than three centuries. This historical record gave clear evidence that abortions had been well known and had been practiced without serious regulation in the United States until the late nineteenth century, when the practice met with new overt strictures. Knowing about the relevant past in this instance subtly shifted one’s perspective. Historical knowledge proved satisfying because it quickened the sense of being linked to the past. Unexpectedly women and men discovered a common tie to the world of long-dead ancestors. Suddenly the burden of dealing with contemporary crises was lessened by the awareness that whatever people might do, they are not the first, nor probably the last, who will be forced to wrestle with this human problem.

This didactic function of history has long been recognized. Voltaire gave classic expression to it when he referred to history as philosophy teaching by example. Less frequently talked about is the derangement felt when the established consensus about national history breaks down, as it did in the last years of the USSR. Soviet scholars had so slavishly served the state that they had written histories with little foundation in the widely shared documentation about the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. As a consequence of glasnost, comparisons could be made between the official Soviet histories and competing accounts of the same events written in the West. Painfully aware of these discrepancies, Mikhail Gorbachev placed a ban on teaching the once-official history to Russian youth until scholars could catch up with the pace of reform. And then he boldly canceled the Soviet Union’s national high school history exams, because, as he said with startling candor, there was no point in testing the students’ knowledge of lies. Here is exposed the linkage of truth, power, and meaning. However much skeptics deride the possibility of historical truth, when it confronts absolute falsehood the potency of a provisional accuracy becomes salient.

In the West we associate “party line” history with totalitarian governments, but even where there is academic freedom there are public repercussions when the delicate balance between consensual interpretations and open inquiry is upset. This was demonstrated in France during the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989, only in this case it was not political but rather academic orthodoxy that generated a crisis. Disputes about the causes and character of the revolutionary events of ’89 and ’93 became so heated and so well publicized that French educational authorities deleted questions about the French Revolution from the secondary school examinations that year.

The similarity between the examples from the Soviet Union and France can be traced to the critical role their revolutions played in modern nation-building. If the historical accounts of these momentous events are muddied, then the nation’s collective identity is put at risk. For the United States, nation-building started with the ideals that justified independence and then gave cohesion to an aggregation of transplanted people establishing homes in a conquered land. Giving heterogeneity a good name, the nation’s unifying creed endorsed the inclusiveness of an open society while falling far short of creating one in practice. Pragmatic initially without philosophers, Americans developed democratic practices which promoted experimentation, invention, and education. A century later a formal theory of pragmatism emerged which depended upon the rules and civility of an open republic and a commitment to the knowability of nature and hence to scientific truth. Today the nation’s democratic creed as well as its pragmatic tradition rely upon a consensus of beliefs about reality and the possibility of arriving at common goals.





The Future of Multiculturalism



The demographic reconfiguration of the American population and the enduring vitality of ethnic differences make it increasingly clear that the exclusive dominance of European cultural forms in the United States is now consignable to a specific time period, let us say 1676 to 1992 (a terminal date fittingly coincident with the Columbian quincentenary). It is no longer a question of whether Americans must work on a multicultural understanding of their past, but how. The very inevitability of this development raises the stakes in current discussions of national history, whether debate swirls around multiculturalism or the search for a single narrative. Disputes over the relative merits of social and political history and the need for stories that build schoolchildren’s self-esteem now elicit passions normally triggered only by anticommunist campaigns and sex scandals.

The more extreme multiculturalists celebrate the virtues of fragmentation. History for them has become an adjunct to “identity politics,” which seeks to realign political forces according to voters’ ethnic, social, and sexual identities. Some insist that since all history has a political—often a propaganda—function, it is time for each group to rewrite history from its own perspective and thereby reaffirm its own past. National identity, in this view, is a chimera created by the elite to indoctrinate other groups in society with its self-serving conception of the country’s purposes. This position has attracted the most outspoken adherents in the African-American community. The head of Temple University’s African-American Studies Department, Molefi Kete Asante, is leading a nationwide crusade among educators to install an Afrocentric curriculum in schools that will stress the contributions of Africans to Western culture and of African-American people to the history of the United States.

Few would disagree with Asante when he points out, “If African-American children were taught to be fully aware of the struggles of our African forebears they would find a renewed sense of purpose and vision in their own lives.”19 Although Asante presents Afrocentrism as a “valid, nonhegemonic perspective” directed to a “correct, accurate history,” he also argues that “the acceptance of Africa as central to African people” has to be the first article of a multicultural curriculum. At the same time, Asante’s efforts are directed toward reorienting the entire Western historical record by insisting that Greek philosophy and art originated in Africa and that African civilizations predate all other civilizations.20 Statements like these sent off alarm signals because it seemed that Asante and his followers were advocating the deliberate distortion of the past to instill pride in those children whose ancestors had been so long excluded from American textbooks.

The history taught to children in the United States has become a national issue precisely because the old bastions of American cultural leadership have been vigorously challenged. The cutting edge of the movement that has thrust class, race, and gender into the nation’s classrooms has been sharpened on the left and used, most effectively, to slice through the self-congratulatory histories of America’s older, self-proclaimed patriots. Traditionalists have been quick to identify the threat to their values in history books that scorn the notion of a united people and adopt a critical stance toward American individualism and, by implication, the competitive élan of American capitalism. These same critics have excoriated political correctness, a term they use derisively to refer to a kind of regimented sympathy shown to the nation’s minorities and women.

Yet a good deal more than political correctness is at issue in the controversy over the teaching of American history. Diverse groups—many of them having been fully politicized in recent years—are now struggling, with good reason, for control of the nation’s memory. The political empowerment of women and blacks along with the intensification of ethnic loyalties among descendants of immigrants from Europe, Asia, and the Americas has made more salient than ever just how many separate—and sometimes discordant—parts of the United States there are. As diverse as the ethnic groups to be embraced in a truly inclusive curriculum are the opinions voiced about curricular reform. Indeed, the proponents of multiculturalism can be placed along a continuum ranging from Afrocentrists who demand a complete overhaul to accommodators who would mechanically tack on new teaching material without addressing its transformative content.

Elected officials play key roles in this combat over the curriculum. In having to decide the history that is taught in the schools they are necessarily setting the terms of imaginative citizenship for everyone, but a consensus about nationhood no longer exists in the government, the academy, or the educational establishment. Insiders and outsiders, school superintendents and school boards, mobilized parents and teachers contend today because they see both the possibility and the desirability of rewriting the story of American nationhood. By insisting on the teaching of divergent historical truths, the multifarious communities within the nation rightfully contest the privilege of officialdom to establish the parameters of national identity. Asian-Americans, Hispanics, homosexuals, and women have joined African-Americans in the battle over the books while Christian fundamentalists vie for the power to censor texts that challenge their religious convictions. In such a contentious setting, authoring a history text has become a hazardous occupation.

The history of the United States has become fragmented in recent years not in comparison to the actuality of an earlier simplicity, but in reference to the simplified story that was told about the nation’s past. Slowly and painfully disengaging from that and the conception of nationhood imbedded in it, historians now confront the task of creating a new narrative framework. Textbooks, like abusive governments, can make people disappear, but only temporarily, for the objects from the suppressed past—the public records, private papers, and oral traditions—survive to pique the curiosity of another generation of inquirers. A comprehensive national history is not now an educational option for the country; it is a cultural imperative. Fragments—whether of research findings or of tangential groups—do not exist independent of the whole that makes them fragments. The full story of the American past can make that evident.

These generalizations will be clarified by looking at the historical treatment of African-Americans. We begin our account in the nineteenth century with the centrality of the American nation. Anthropomorphized into a being with personal traits and lofty purposes, the nation walked away with the principal part in the historical drama of the United States that was taught to successive generations of students. Slightly amended at the beginning of this century by the incorporation of the Progressives’ work on class conflict and later by Perry Miller’s rehabilitation of the Puritans, the typical narrative of national history followed the successful development of political freedom and economic prosperity from the Revolution to the present. Despite the arrival of blacks in England’s American colonies in 1619, they formed a shadowy presence in history textbooks. Two and a half centuries later, their emancipation appeared to ennoble the Civil War slaughter, but the actual freed men and women retreated to the sidelines. This episodic attention calls to mind the wry comment of British historian George Unwin that slavery figured in English history only in connection with its abolition. A fortiori, this was true for the United States.

Historians are frequently exposed to the charge that they write the present back into the past, putting into the record concerns that did not earlier exist. The reverse holds true for African-American history. When scholars began researching the details of slave life in the Chesapeake and free black communities in the urban South, they were recovering stories that had always been there. For ten generations, white Americans had suppressed evidence of the black presence and excluded their experience from the national narrative. By doing so they had shaped memory to the psychological needs of a white citizenry deeply conflicted by its persistent racial hostility. A peculiarly sensitive bearer of the troubled spirit of white racism, Thomas Jefferson explained why freed slaves and their ex-masters could never live together in peace, cursed as their relation was by “deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks of the injuries they have sustained.”21

Divided soon after the Revolution by the abolition of slavery in the states north of the Mason-Dixon line, Northern and Southern whites were paradoxically reknit by the Civil War Emancipation because both now feared the liberated African-Americans. Unable to expel African-Americans from their midst, as Jefferson had wished to do, the arbiters of the new national community made them invisible.22 Scholars, for the most part, complied by taking a vow of silence, proving Louis Hartz’s point that American historians represented “an erudite reflection of the limited social perspectives of the average American himself.”23 Here the influence of the narrative upon historical construction is particularly instructive. As long as history writers only recounted the progress of natural rights and democratic governance, there could be no place for collective shortcomings, unless they were remedied. The sooty, haggard workers of the twelve-hour factory shift found a place in history books once the New Deal successes of the union movement rectified their situation. Similarly, women could figure in history texts in connection with their long, tenacious struggle for the vote, but this tying of national identity to the achievement of equality and liberty has prevented the custodians of national history from publicly coming to terms with the import of slavery and its legacy of racial prejudices.

Nothing embarrassed white Americans more than slavery, because they had pitched their political identity on the fulfillment of the doctrine that all men are born equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. While slavery could figure in European histories as a barbaric enterprise, explicable in the context of the fiercely competitive Atlantic economy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it became for the United States an incubus better denied than confronted. The successful end of slavery did demonstrate the overcoming of an original injustice, but African-Americans quickly receded from the national consciousness when the segregation era overtook slavery and then Northern urban poverty replaced Southern segregation.

As Mary Douglas explained, nations keep their shape by molding their citizens’ understanding of the past, causing its members to forget those events that do not accord with its righteous image while keeping alive those memories that do.24 This effort to control the collective memory necessarily affronts those committed to recovering the fullness of the past record. Ironically, it is perhaps the excluded African-Americans who can most easily comprehend the urgency European-Americans once felt for constructing a story of national origins. Giving the United States an exceptional destiny in 1776 was a means of providing a collective identity to a detached and fragile fragment of European society, a way of sinking down ideological roots in the alien and conquered soil of the New World. Demands today for an Afrocentrist education for African-American children is an echo of the imperative that European-Americans responded to throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth.

For much of their history, Americans have shown a preference for hypocrisy over cynicism. Forced to choose between giving up their allegiance to the highest ideals of the Declaration of Independence and living with the tension caused by the shortfall between ideal and reality, most have elected to remain what foreigners consider naively idealistic. Rather than become the cynics of dashed hopes, they have evaded the evidence of their hypocrisy, or worse, have blamed and stigmatized the victims of their failures. In his pathbreaking study, the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called the contradiction between the natural-rights philosophy of the national creed and the country’s extravagant race consciousness an American Dilemma.25 Highly attuned to the profound sense of otherness that white Americans projected upon their black fellow citizens, Myrdal explored the dilemma of having to let go of aspirations or to deracinate prejudice. Also measuring the full weight of Americans’ affirmation of enduring moral precepts, he called it “a gross mistake” to think that the appeal of justice and tolerance could ever be easily extinguished.26 The civil rights movement which climaxed in Southern desegregation a score of years later proved him right. Living with a post-civil-rights backlash, Americans now confront that temptation to retreat to cynicism.

With improved vision, the post-World War II generation of social historians saw and made conspicuous for all what had always been there—the fascinating and frightening drama of Africans in America, beginning with “20 and odd Negroes…bought at the best and easiest rate” from a Dutch man-of-war in Jamestown in 1619 through the swelling of a half million slaves at the time of the Declaration of Independence to the population of 3,838,000 on the eve of the Civil War.27 Given an opening toward freedom in the revolutionary era, free blacks—the fastest-growing group in the United States until 1810—laid the basis for the African-American community that offered a template for churches, occupations, and voluntary associations in the post-Emancipation period.28 Incorporating these details of the African-American experience in national history, however, proved almost impossible, because they represented such an indigestible element in the tale of American democracy. If in the late twentieth century Americans can accept the less lofty truth that despite its goals, the United States was the promised land of those who were free, male, and white, it is because that era appears to be ending.

Recreating the details of African-American history has had two potent effects upon contemporary thought: it has vivified the black presence in the American past, and it has simultaneously destroyed the coherence of the Whiggish account of national progress. With African-Americans present, the story line has blurred; the unifying destiny dissolves into statistical projections of how diverse groups will fare in the United States. Critics of social history have missed the point when they complain that attending to the insignificant lives of the many trivialize the grand epic of the American nation. The problem lies closer to the spiritual link between history and national identity in the United States. Far from trivializing standard histories, experiences cruelly at odds with the narrative of American success subvert them.

The fight between the traditionalists and multiculturalists over the nation’s textbooks resonates with the arguments and emotions that flared up in the 1960s when the Black Power movement challenged the goal of assimilation.29 The territorial separatism then called for has found a spiritual echo in current demands for a separate curriculum, even separate schools for minority children in danger of intellectual oppression from Anglos (now defined as including all white Americans of non-Hispanic descent). Stirring up the staid decorum of the educational establishment, Afrocentrists since the mid-1980s have vigorously assailed that assimilationist faith that provides the soul of American public schools.

To a remarkable degree, the nation’s colleges and universities have become negotiating centers mediating the heightened sense of commonality and difference that the classes of the 1990s have brought to their campuses. While parents of all walks of life wonder what’s happening, their college-age children are living the reality of multicultural tensions, veterans at eighteen of white flight, busing, the feminization of poverty, and the expansion of entitlements. Actually, the two generations have set the agenda in tandem, for as Erik Erikson has wisely noted, “the values of any new generation do not spring full blown from their heads; they are already there, inherent if not clearly articulated in the older generation…. The younger generation makes overt what is covert in the older generation; the child expresses openly what the parent represses.”30

From the perspective of the nation’s fourteen million college students, the permeability of inherited cultures stands out. Neither a genetic endowment nor an environmental stamping machine, culture stands for a fluid cluster of influences which each individual selectively responds to in fashioning an autonomous identity. For late-twentieth-century students, learning about a larger universe of meaning and significance at college perforates rather than rigidifies the boundaries set in childhood. “Appreciation is merely provincial,” John Higham has noted, “if not grounded in knowledge and values that bring into judgment a range of humanity far wider than the people who are immediately at issue.”31 Whatever may have taken place in preparatory schools, colleges and universities will inexorably pry open the doors to the mind. That’s why the democratization of university education will continue to transform the society at large. Like cultural identity, personal assimilation into an American mainstream will remain an option. Meanwhile the country deserves leaders who are alert to the discrepancy in access, ambition, and hope among its disparate members.

Cacophonous or harmonic, the motifs of a multicultural history of the United States will have to incorporate themes and variations on all the identities that Americans carry with them, because only this will satisfy our awakened curiosity about what it truly means to be a part of American democracy. When people urge that the nation move beyond the politics of ethnic and sexual identity, they implicitly underestimate the power of society to make such categories the determinants of how one is viewed. Moreover, leaving unexplored the variety of ways that national institutions have perpetuated difference while celebrating universality risks reenacting the characteristically American routine of denial, e.g., ignoring present injustices by dwelling upon the future fulfillment of moral goals. Instead of rushing beyond the separations imposed in the past, the country should initiate affirmative action for the multicultural spirit and set-asides for historical honesty. Writing the multicultural history of the United States will not come naturally; it will take an act of national will. Recognizing diversity as an integral and venerable component of American life might even arouse curiosity about the contrapuntal effects of diversity and uniformity in the United States, about how the practice of differentiation played against the theme of universal values, about the collective anxiety engendered by patterned discrimination within a national self-image of tolerant acceptance.

Of course, to evoke national will is to assert the moral presence of the nation. Anathema to some multiculturalists, the nation nonetheless exists as a powerful unifying force in American public life. People who call for pride in the group often minimize the importance of engendering pride in the nation, but the two stand or fall together. It is the nation that sustains and protects the array of particular identities in the United States. Only the critical relationship between the whole, with its authority, moral force, and material wealth, and each particular group, insistent upon its share, its place, and its rights within the whole, can make the multicultural debate intelligible.

Late-twentieth-century Western consciousness contains a particular skepticism about comprehensive understanding that has been thoroughly incorporated into public thought. Everyone seems to accept the idea that truth varies with different cultures. Most people even work hard at being cultural relativists, trying to respect, without necessarily endorsing, differences in values and behavior, recognizing the venerable wisdom lodged in tolerance. It was, after all, the sixteenth-century writer Montaigne who said that “every man calls evil what he does not understand.” But knowledge of the culture of others in no way obliterates the power or authenticity of one’s own culture unless, as in much of Western history, cultural imperialism denies multiplicity in social values. Respect for the values of others necessarily entails an appreciative exploration of one’s own group’s truths; in the United States that begins with a choice of identity.





The Invisible Force of Structure in the Past



Although a nation is an imagined community resting on intangible connections, a visit to the post office, tax auditor, or military recruiter quickly demonstrates its concreteness. One might not be self-conscious about national identity while licking a postage stamp, but news reports of American soldiers in faraway battlefields or Fourth of July parades can quicken one’s awareness of the nation. Any American alive when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 knows how riveting the sense of membership in one’s society can be. The visibility and invisibility of the nation mirrors the entire network of configurations of practice and belief that structure social reality.

History became a modern discipline when its major theorists began to seek knowledge of the broad, unseen structures that channel processes of change. Curiosity about great men and women or precedent-shattering events yielded early in the nineteenth century to a more compelling interest in the regularities that structured social action. With Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, the search for structure became part and parcel of the modernity of the discipline of history. They and their followers believed that time had a direction and that society, like nature, was composed of a network of systems that scientific investigation could locate. These students of structure extended the reach of historical knowledge by articulating theories and pursuing research that created comprehensive frameworks for the myriad of discrete facts building up about the past. Maintaining these structures, in their view, were causal laws of universal validity.

As interim reports, their findings were impressive, but, not being prescient, much of their work was overtaken by history itself. Disenchanted by the shortfall in the analytical grasp of the great sociological theorists, contemporary historians have retreated to smaller questions—not why capitalism triumphed in the West, but what happened to displaced weavers when mechanization came to Gloucestershire. Late-twentieth-century historians find a uniqueness in the complexity of events which mocks the earlier mimicry of the scientific model of uniform truths. In recent years, historians of culture have resisted the reduction of events to material causes, avoiding the language of explanation so completely that they sometimes appear to deny any validity at all to hypotheses about causation. Postmodernists efface the distinction between text and context, insisting on a seamless web that is violated with statements like “She wrote this because…” With language and culture all-determining in these circles, the distinctions between independent and dependent variables, between discourse and actions, between culture and society, has become blurred, if not totally neglected.

Causal analysis inevitably comes under fire because by its very nature it relies on distinctions of significance that are difficult to make. How can causes be assigned to an event if the number of factors involved is huge, perhaps infinite? E. H. Carr once told the story of Mr. Jones, who, returning from a party where he had had several drinks and driving a car with defective brakes, knocked down and killed Mr. Robinson at a blind corner. Mr. Robinson was on his way to buy cigarettes. What was the cause of the accident? Mr. Jones’s state of semi-intoxication, the defects in his brakes, the poor visibility at the corner, or Mr. Robinson’s addiction to cigarettes?32 And doesn’t any analysis of this case depend on whether Mr. Robinson and Mr. Jones were white or black, homosexual or heterosexual (perhaps one of them was on his way to a gay bar and was preoccupied), or even accident-prone or rock-steady? Would an explanation—a causal analysis—of Mr. Robinson’s accident apply to anyone else? Can historians ever hope to make sense of events like the Cold War or the French Revolution if the simplest everyday event is so fraught with perplexities?

Inferential evidence of invisible structures and patterns abounds, nonetheless. The nation is one of the most important structures in present-day lives, but others, ranging from natural ones like patterns of climate to social ones like the world economy, need only be named to be recognized. And if their existence is readily conceded, can questions about their causes be stifled? Whether natural or social, these transcendent forces are rarely palpable. The falling rain is visible, but it takes meteorologists to explain the structure of climatic change. Social forces like the market organization of private bargains and the influence of images on women’s behavior are more elusive. Everyone can see the paycheck or watch actresses in television commercials, but it is very hard to detect the system that welds these discrete actions into an economy or a code of gender norms. Social structures refer to consistent relationships between people, and because they are sustained by patterns of beliefs, they cannot be located without well-articulated theories.

The nineteenth-century social scientists’ invention of structure, with its corollaries of patterning, process, and interacting systems of causation, represents a powerful intellectual tool for understanding social action. Modern Westerners cannot live without causal language and generalizations about human behavior because these organize their reality. Without heuristic concepts of such things as the nation, culture, class, ethnicity, education, and the global economy, the complexity of life would break down into a welter of isolated facts. People want to make sense of their world, even if explanations are proved to be necessarily partial. Mr. Robinson’s family and friends would ask why the accident happened. If accidents like his happened frequently enough, local authorities would begin asking the same question. Answers would always depend on generalizations about patterns of human behavior. Similarly, people can’t help wondering why the French Revolution or the Cold War happened. Causal explanations can never be wholly satisfying, if only because new facets of human experience are always being discovered. Nonetheless, attempts to make sense of car accidents or the French Revolution or the Cold War will continue, and having a conceptual vocabulary about structure and causation greatly enhances these efforts.

Scientists from Newton on have encouraged people to think that they could master nature, and on this model, establish their own autonomy as social actors. The result was the collapse of old-regime intellectual and political absolutisms and a new search for secular explanations of nature and society. Paradoxically, that very same science also showed human beings that they were themselves the product of various causal processes. Science therefore threatened the possibility of free will and self-conscious autonomy even as it extended the intellectual grasp of those deprived of freedom of action. In one of modernity’s greatest ironies, the success of science undermined the confidence that promoted its cultural dominance in the West.33

An enduring legacy of the nineteenth century has been the lesson that human action always occurs within institutional and cultural structures—powerful, pervasive, and invisible. The human craving for meaning expresses itself within conventions, codes, and shared understandings just as procreating and producing for survival unfold in paths cut by habit, custom, and prescription. These organize every single act of daily life from brushing one’s teeth in front of a mirror each morning to reading a novel in bed at night. Historians must recreate social structures in order to interpret the human activity described in the records. To ignore the channeling and shaping done by structures because they have to be made “visible” through description and analysis or because they are so numerous as to clog the historical narrative would be to abandon the effort to reconstruct reality.

From ancient times, observers of the human scene have been divided in their weighing of free will and determinism. We think that the two exist in tension; structures confining and directing what is thought and done, and imagination in the service of personal desire breaking free from the social molds and rechanneling human effort. Structures do not determine how human beings act, but they do constrain the options for action at any given moment, even as the structures themselves are battered by the forces of change.





A Summing Up



History springs from the human fascination with self-discovery, from the persistent concern about the nature of existence and people’s engagement with it. Men and women have learned to externalize this curiosity—even to distance themselves from its impertinent subjectivity—by directing their questions to concepts and abstractions like the growth of democracy or the ascendancy of modernity, but the renewable source of energy behind these inquiries comes from an intense craving for information about what it is to be human.

Human beings are born into a group which provides answers to the first and most basic questions they pose about life. Few outlive the impress of that first organization of consciousness. Hence, ethnocentrism is common to all folk. Nonetheless, it presents special problems to a pluralistic democracy like that of the United States. Similarly, the desire to rewrite the past to accommodate group pride is too human to be viewed as a part of a conspiracy. Nor is there anything particularly sinister about the impulse to manipulate national history, even though its effects are far from neutral. Professional historians are most acutely aware of this temptation to sacrifice accuracy to the goals of glorification or lesson-teaching, but all people are the historians of their own lives and know something of the urge to point their past toward a useful moral precept. Even when people have no motive to bend history in a particular direction, they have difficulty getting it straight. There is an additional perceptual problem: once the outcome of an action is known, it is almost impossible not to project back into the past the knowledge of what happened subsequently. Or to be more psychological, it is hard to take in the fact that those living in the past were ignorant about the future. Similarly, when people reflect upon their previous actions, they tend to ascribe to stupidity what more justly should be charged to lack of foreknowledge.

Despite the naturalness of distorting or fudging the past, the cost of suppressing information comes high. Nothing could be less true than the old bromide that what you don’t know doesn’t hurt you. The very opposite seems more the case. What you don’t know is especially hurtful, for it denies you the opportunity to deal with reality. It restricts choices by decreasing information. The health of the nation may require a careful winnowing of memory, but a democratic, and hence American, creed argues otherwise. It endorses the individual’s right to liberty—and implicitly freedom of inquiry—without reference to the goal of political solidarity. The instrumental logic of keeping the nation’s shape by causing people to forget those experiences incompatible with the nation’s righteous image is doubly ironic for Americans because the righteous image of the United States places ideals above utility. Moreover, the freedom to explore the full record of the nation’s past unimpeded by “off-limits” signs can easily be deduced from those rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness which initially endowed the nation with a moral personality.

The commitment to truth and to those intellectual traditions that underpin this resonating affirmation needs defending today from two broad attacks. The one stems from the discovery of social structuring and its restrictive impact upon the individuals whose freedom to pursue truth is being affirmed. The other comes from skepticism about the validity of the representations of reality made by freedom-seeking inquirers. To meet these provocative challenges we have summoned history, particularly the history of the idea of objectivity. Far from banishing relativism, postmodernism, nihilism, and various forms of solipsistic thinking, we authors have pooled our learning in order to locate the relationship of these critiques to the long dialogue about knowledge that began in the seventeenth century, gained momentum in succeeding centuries under the rubric of modern science, and today has yielded to a variety of noisy conversations.

Fundamental to our own engagement with reality has been a conception of women and men as creatures driven to know and to chart their lives by what they believe to be true. History can help here, for it offers a variety of tools for effecting liberation from intrusive authority, outworn creeds, and counsels of despair. Historical analysis teaches that members of society raise structures that confine people’s actions and then build systems of thought that deny those structures. It also suggests that all bodies of knowledge acquire ideological overtones, because their meaning is too potent to be ignored. What is to be concluded from myth-dispelling disclosures like the ones offered here? We think they point to the power of a revitalized public, when operating in a pluralistic democracy with protected dissent, to mediate intelligently between society and the individual, knowledge and passion, clarity and obfuscation, hope and doubt. Telling the truth takes a collective effort.

In one view, science simply supplies information and any attention that is paid to it should come not from philosophers or historians but from politicians.

26. We recognize that postmodernists, including Foucault and Derrida, have held a variety of (not always consistent) positions about truth. We have elided some of those differences here, no doubt to the consternation of some readers, in the interest of moving forward with our own account about history. We thank Joseph Rouse for bringing to our attention the complexities of the postmodernist response to the question of truth. He bears no responsibility for our rendition of this question, with which he most likely disagrees. For an attempt to sort out the postmodernist positions on these issues, see Christopher Norris, What’s Wrong with Postmodernism: Critical Theory and the Ends of Philosophy (Baltimore, 1990). For an example of the ambiguity surrounding truth found among postmodernists, see Lyotard, Toward the Postmodern.

Between 1976 and 1990, the percentage of English-language publications in French history that were devoted to political and diplomatic history decreased by half and publications in economic and social history declined by one-fourth, while those in intellectual and cultural history doubled. The trend toward decline in social history was even more pronounced in France, the home of the Annales school. The percentage of French-language publications in French history devoted to political and diplomatic history declined by about one-fourth and those in social and economic history declined by half, whereas those in intellectual and cultural history doubled. Based on Tables 1 and 2 in Thomas J. Schaeper, “French History as Written on Both Sides of the Atlantic: A Comparative Analysis,” French Historical Studies, 17 (1991): 242–43.
