title: 6 Postmodernism and the Crisis of Modernity
---







FROM THE 1960S ONWARD, new trends in the writing of history combined with larger social and political transformations to dethrone many of the long-standing absolutisms about the nature of the American nation and the certainty provided by the heroic model of science. Social history challenged American unity by telling about competing and conflicting ethnic and racial groups whose experience could not be fitted easily, if at all, into a single story line glorifying an essentially white Protestant nation. In growing numbers the new social historians also subverted the happy tale of the self-reliant, ever-entrepreneurial individual who made his (always his) own choices and thereby fortuitously contributed to the strengths of the American capitalist economy. Similarly, social histories of science showed that even the heroes and geniuses of science had lived lives fully enmeshed in the social and political relations of their time. Newton and Darwin would not have articulated theories of such universal breadth without the push and pull of religious, political, and social interests. Suddenly, science, like the forging of the nation, only made sense in a social context.

As might be expected, the social historians’ challenge to the foundations of America’s (and more generally the West’s) faith in itself has provoked attacks, particularly from the political right. Defenders of the traditional views about American history and Western culture berate the new generation of historians for their supposed cynicism about national and Western values. The new historians’ critical stance, it is alleged, prevented them from telling an edifying national saga and from explicating transcendent Western values. Gertrude Himmelfarb, for example, took social historians to task for “devaluing the political realm” and thus denigrating history and even reason itself. Their “revolution in the discipline” undermined the rationality inherent in the historical enterprise, she claimed. They did this by focusing on the irrational and nonrational infrastructures of life—ranging from the economic interests of legislators to the eating habits of ordinary folk—rather than on “the constitutions and laws that permit men to order their affairs in a rational manner.”1

In her report to Congress in 1988, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Lynne V. Cheney, stopped just short of attributing the recent decline in the number of history majors to social history itself. Students no longer grasp the importance of studying history, she asserted, because the increasing specialization of the disciplines and the enthusiasm for quantitative techniques—both central to the development of social history—had undermined the necessary sense of a unified educational purpose. The “crisis” in the humanities the “isolation” and “disarray” she found among scholars had been caused, she concluded, by politicization. The humanities had been reduced to “arguing that truth—and beauty and excellence—are not timeless matters, but transitory notions, devices used by some groups to perpetuate ‘hegemony’ over others.”2 Social history was thus deeply implicated in the whole debate on Western culture.

These attacks stung but they did not kill. Social history had been predicated on the assumption that more was better; if more was known about the lives of ordinary people, workers, women, and slaves (or about the values and belief systems of scientists), accounts of the past would be fuller. Social historians did not oppose the standards of objectivity or the codes of professional discipline; they used those very standards to challenge the traditional interpretations which had excluded marginal or nonconforming historical groups.

Social historians hoped to fill out the record by offering a more complex picture of the past, but one of the main effects of their work has been to reveal how limited the previous histories were. In effect, they underlined the fact that history writing had always been intensely ideological. The story of “one nation under God,” for example, served the interests of some, not all, of the people. American history—and the history of Western civilization more generally—could be construed as political propaganda for ruling elites. Thus, the new social history can be used (and sometimes abused) by those who insist that history can no longer offer one national narrative, that it is always partial, always political, always propagandistic, indeed, mythical. Ironically, then, the work of social historians fostered the argument that history could never be objective. It is as if the social historians with their passion for breaking apart the historical record had dug a potentially fatal hole into which history as a discipline might disappear altogether.

This opening has been seized upon by a new group of critics called postmodernists who question the objectivity of the social sciences more generally. Their critique has gone beyond specific denunciations of the ideological character of American history or Western science to attack the very foundations of historical and scientific knowledge. Although “postmodernism” has become a ubiquitous term in the latest cultural wars between traditionalists and their opponents, it is a notoriously slippery label.3 At times, it seems as if everyone is a postmodernist; at others, that everyone avoids a category that can be synonymous with nihilism and ridiculous self-posturing. (If you think of both Jacques Derrida and Madonna as postmodernists you get some sense of the definitional problem.) Defining postmodernism involves three related terms: “modernity,” “modernism,” and “poststructuralism.” Briefly put, modernity is the modern, industrial, and urban way of life; modernism is the movement in art and literature that aims to capture the essence of that new way of life (the skyscraper, for example); and poststructuralism is the theoretical critique of the assumptions of modernity found in philosophy, art, and criticism since the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The term “postmodernism” first gained currency in the arts and especially architecture as a way of designating anti-modernist forms of art. Postmodernist architects rejected the pragmatic, efficient, rationalist functionalism of modernist architecture in favor of more whimsical, historical, and unpredictable shapes and lines. As the use of the term spread outward from the arts, it came to mean more generally the critique of modernity as a set of assumptions about industrial and technological forms of life. As we have defined it, modernity stands for a specifically Western set of notions that took root in the eighteenth century; it entails a new periodization of history (ancient, medieval, modern) in which the modern denotes the period when reason and science triumphed over Scripture, tradition, and custom. At the heart of modernity is the notion of the freely acting, freely knowing individual whose experiments can penetrate the secrets of nature and whose work with other individuals can make a new and better world.

Postmodernists’ primary goal has been to challenge convictions about the objectivity of knowledge and the stability of language. This is not the place for a history of theories of language, or for an account of the transformation of poststructuralism into a more general form of postmodernist cultural criticism.4 We focus instead on the questions raised by postmodernism about the meaning and writing of history. Our goal is to navigate a course between the traditionalist critics and the postmodernists, by defending the role of an objective and inclusive history while recognizing the need for exploring its conceptual fault lines.

Postmodernism renders problematic the belief in progress, the modern periodization of history, and the individual as knower and doer. The very notion of the individual self, so central both to the Enlightenment’s philosophy of human rights and to historians’ accounts of American destiny, is threatened when postmodernists stress the inevitable fragmentation of personal identity. In one of the most striking formulations of the so-called death of the subject, Michel Foucault proclaimed that the concept of man “is an invention of recent date” and would soon disappear, “like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea.”5 Postmodernists assert that the individual self is an ideological construct, a myth perpetuated by liberal societies whose legal systems depend upon the concept of individual responsibility. By making this argument against the unified self—postmodernists call it “the subject” to underline its lack of autonomy—they also, perhaps inadvertently, undermine the premises of multiculturalism. Without an identifiable self, there would be no need to worry about differing cultures, ethnic pride, and battered identities. Without a subject, there could be no identity politics, no politics of cultural self-affirmation.

Postmodernist critics of history and science operate in the attack mode. They take on all that the modern has come to represent. They insist that the experiences of genocide, world wars, depressions, pollution, and famine have cast doubt on the inevitability of progress, enlightenment, and reason, even while they implicitly deny human access to certain knowledge of these same disasters. Indeed, they argue against the possibility of any certain knowledge. Postmodernists question the superiority of the present and the usefulness of general worldviews, whether Christian, Marxist, or liberal. For them, as Foucault has claimed, “each society has its regime of truth, its ‘general politics’ of truth.”6 With them, there is no truth outside of ideology.

Since science has supplied the foundation of Western knowledge from the eighteenth century onward, it has predictably drawn the attention of postmodernists. One postmodernist explains, “Science was the alpha and omega of the modernists and the structuralists; they saw science as…the ultimate given of modernity.”7 According to Foucault, “in societies like ours, the ‘political economy’ of truth…is centered on the form of scientific discourse and the institutions which produce it; it is subject to constant economic and political incitement.”8 Science and technology, in this view, are seen as constantly propelled by hegemony-seeking interests. The claims scientists make for objectivity and truth are part of an intellectual economy in which paucity and manipulation characterize truth-seeking, a tortured enterprise trapped within discourses, themselves the products of biased institutions.

Other postmodernists ask if the cognitive methods of science can be neutral when the larger aims of scientists figure in gendered, ideological, and political agendas. They argue that the emphasis on the objectivity of scientific facts is itself an ideological construction put forward by scientists to mask the active role that they play in selecting and shaping the facts. Seeing the laboratory as primarily the nexus for power relations and political gestures, postmodernists believe that they have been successful in “dissipating previous beliefs surrounding science.” “Nothing special,” they maintain, “nothing extraordinary, in fact nothing of any cognitive quality” occurs in the laboratory. In this view, scientific laboratories are entirely shaped by political agendas. Paradoxically, they assign historians and sociologists the task of figuring out how the laboratories got to have so much political power in the first place.9

Postmodernists often put the word “reality” in quotation marks to problematize the “there” out there. To them, no reality can possibly transcend the discourse in which it is expressed.10 Scientists may think that the disciplined practices employed in laboratories—the seeing in the microscope or telescope—brings them closer to reality, but they are simply privileging the language that they speak, the technologies of their own self-fashioning.11 And, needless to say, such privileging has led to the horrors of our century. In this line of argument, Westerners are particularly prone to the conceit that reality is fixed and knowable.

As this brief review shows, postmodernists have not yet developed a unified critique of science. Some consider it to be simply another form of discourse, and hence no more privileged than any other; others relegate it to the status of information and separate it from society and the disputes about social knowledge. In general, postmodernist critics devote more of their energy to the realm of history, especially narrative, and even to the modern idea of time itself. Appropriately Delphic, one postmodernist critic called attention to the coming time when “the tellable time of realism and its consensus become the untellable time of postmodern writing.” This entails nothing less than “the disappearance of history,” a prediction accompanied by the promise that “the postmodern subversion of historical time” will in turn threaten the idea of human rights, the definition of disciplines, the possibility of representation in politics and art, and the informational functions of language.12 These are not small stakes!

The nature of historical truth, objectivity, and the narrative form of history have all been targeted by postmodernists. The mastery of time becomes merely the willful imposition on subordinate peoples of a Western, imperialistic historical consciousness; it provides no access to true explanation, knowledge, or understanding. The mastery of facts disguises the wily ruse of the aggrandizing master historian who—like the idea of the author or the scientist—is simply a figment of the Western, capitalist imagination. Moreover, these are figments that do damage. They reinforce the hegemony of white Western men over women, other races, and other peoples. In the postmodern account of Western history, totalitarianism refers not to specific regimes or governments but to every possible form of domination: “The historical names for this Mr. Nice Guy totalitarianism are no longer Stalingrad or Normandy (much less Auschwitz), but Wall Street’s Dow Jones Average and Tokyo’s Nikkei Index.” By this account, the very idea of development is a form of terror, and democracy is simply more “discreet” than Nazism.13

Where does this fury of negation come from? And can it be taken seriously? It is not hard to understand why events since the 1930s have cast doubt on the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century idea of ineluctable progress. The experience of the twentieth century shows that science and technology can be used to build death camps and atom bombs as easily as they can be used to light streets, increase crop yields, and prolong life. History professors went to work for Nazis, communist regimes, and right-wing dictators as often as for democratic governments. The discipline of history does not disengage its practitioners from the demands of politics, nor does the objectivity of science guarantee benign applications. Progress can be a double-edged sword.

Although the general sources of discontent with modernity are easy enough to identify, it is much harder to follow the logic of postmodernist arguments or determine their political agenda. The aims of postmodernists have been the subject of intense debate. Although they tend to believe that all knowledge is deeply political, their own politics are only obliquely expressed, and usually as criticism rather than as prescription. Their notions about power have been questioned because two of their most important intellectual forebears, the German philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, made notoriously antidemocratic, anti-Western, and antihumanist pronouncements and were associated, sometimes fairly, sometimes not, with anti-Semitism. Hitler cited Nietzsche’s writings in support of his racial ideology, and Heidegger himself joined the Nazi Party. Although most theorists of postmodernity have clearly rejected the proto-fascist and anti-Semitic implications of the work of Nietzsche and Heidegger, doubts remain about the ease with which one can separate the strands in their thought.

In our view, postmodernists are deeply disillusioned intellectuals who denounce en masse Marxism and liberal humanism, communism and capitalism, and all expectations of liberation. They insist that all of the regnant ideologies are fundamentally the same because these ideologies are driven by the desire to discipline and control the population in the name of science and truth. No form of liberation can escape from these parameters of control. In many ways, then, postmodernism is an ironic, perhaps even despairing view of the world, one which, in its most extreme forms, offers little role for history as previously known. On the other hand, postmodernism raises arresting questions about truth, objectivity, and history that cannot simply be dismissed. Moreover, these questions hit the nerve exposed by the widespread realization that the nineteenth-century models of science and history are in urgent need of refashioning.





The Historical Lineage of Postmodernism



The foremost contemporary apostles of postmodernism are two French philosophers, Michel Foucault (1926–84) and Jacques Derrida (1930-). Much of postmodernist criticism can be traced to their influence and through them back to Nietzsche and Heidegger. This is not to say that Foucault and Derrida endorsed the claims made by all those calling themselves postmodernists. Many other (mostly French) names might be cited in an honor roll of poststructuralist and postmodernist critics—Jacques Lacan in psychoanalysis, Roland Barthes in literary criticism, and Jean-François Lyotard in philosophy. But Foucault and Derrida provided the crucial arguments for postmodernism, particularly for postmodernism as it has taken shape in America.

Both philosophers grew to adulthood in the difficult postwar years of the late 1940s and early 1950s. They were not personal friends, but they helped shape a common intellectual agenda with a wide international resonance. In their work, they made poststructuralism, if not exactly a household word, at least a label to conjure with—even if both of them rejected most exercises in labeling. Moving beyond French intellectual circles, Foucault worked in Sweden, Germany, Tunisia, and California, and Derrida, born in Algeria, has taught extensively in the United States.

Despite their considerable differences in approach—and their polemics against each other—both Foucault and Derrida sought to challenge the most fundamental assumptions of Western social science.14 Put most schematically, they deny our ability to represent reality in any objectively true fashion and offer to “deconstruct” (a word made famous by Derrida and his followers) the notion of the individual as an autonomous, self-conscious agent. With writings that are part literary criticism and part philosophy (and in Foucault’s case, part historical commentary), they leveled their sights on Western Man, defined as rational, capable of objectivity, and in possession of knowledge that corresponds to the truth of nature and society. In short, they attacked the entire Enlightenment project.

Taking Nietzsche as their inspiration, Foucault and Derrida made Western Man into a modern-day Gulliver, tied down with ideological ropes and incapable of transcendence because he can never get beyond the veil of language to the reality “out there.” The Nietzschean vision, conveyed through irony and satire, permits varying interpretations, and postmodernists offer a multiplicity of responses to his iconoclastic writings. Foucault described reading Nietzsche as a “philosophical shock” and a “revelation,” but that hardly distinguishes him from most American undergraduates.15 Thus the Nietzschean influence could be partly stylistic and literary, partly philosophical. Foucault and Derrida often tried to emulate aspects of Nietzsche’s difficult, aphoristic, and allusive writing style because they saw it as consonant with his central intellectual argument that all concepts are in the end illusory creatures of the moment. Knowledge, Nietzsche taught, is an invention that masks a will to power.

Nietzsche fashioned himself into the ultimate philosophical ironist and amoralist. He insisted that the West’s “infinitely complex cathedral of concepts” was built “on a movable foundation and as it were on running water.”16 Human beings do not discover a truth in concordance with nature; they invent it, so that truth is always changing just as the water in a river is always changing. Claims for truth can therefore only be dissimulations, invariably advanced by those who have power. The noble, true, and good in Western values is only what the ancient nobility claimed them to be; then came the transgressive revolution of Christianity that led the underclasses to effect a fateful reversal of values. In Christianity, according to Nietzsche, the meek, weak, and lowly got their revenge. Democracy furthered the reversal of values because the “herd” of humanity made itself the arbiter of truth and reinforced the Christian “slave” morality.

Nietzsche’s argument often approached the morally repugnant. In The Genealogy of Morals, for example, he exclaimed, “Let us face facts: the people have triumphed—or the slaves, the mob, the herd, whatever you wish to call them—and if the Jews brought it about, then no nation ever had a more universal mission on this earth…. I don’t deny that this triumph might be looked upon as a kind of blood poisoning, since it has resulted in a mingling of the races….”17 Perhaps unaware of the proven historical dangers of such statements, some postmodernists have wandered recklessly into commenting upon Nietzschean perspectives. Alice Jardine confidently asserts that “the shock of recognition that Western Truth, and the Western desire for Truth, have been a terrible error is what Nietzsche leaves for the twentieth century to gain the hard way.”18 In a more extreme rendition, Jean-François Lyotard advanced the hypothesis that “the characteristic features of the Judaic religion, and of the West to the extent that it is a product of that religion, are not to be sought in obsessional neurosis but in psychosis.” Lyotard has devoted much of his work to criticism of the “defaillancy [in French défaillance means extinction or decay] of modernity,” the collapse of all emancipatory narratives.19

Like Nietzsche, the postmodernists want to use history against itself, to attack the certainties and absolutes that provided the foundation for positivism and for the human sciences that emerged in the course of the nineteenth century. Foucault, for example, described his version of history in Nietzschean language: it “disturbs what was previously considered immobile;…fragments what was thought unified;…shows the heterogeneity of what was imagined consistent with itself.” Foucault proclaimed grandly that “I am well aware that I have never written anything but fictions.” He nevertheless insisted, in typically Nietzschean ironic terms, “I do not mean to go so far as to say that fictions are beyond truth (hors vérité). It seems to me that it is possible to make fiction work inside of truth….”20 Yet Foucault never specified how he could determine this “truth” or even what its epistemological status might be.

Assistance in the enterprise of going “beyond truth” came also from Martin Heidegger. This debt to Heidegger has further embroiled postmodernism in political controversy, for his unrepentant membership in the Nazi Party has long raised questions about the political meaning of his work. Like Nietzsche before him, Heidegger depicted Western philosophy and culture in dire crisis. We are “latecomers in a history now racing toward its end,” he insisted in 1946. Heidegger rejected Enlightenment values of reason and objectivity even more extremely than Nietzsche. In an essay titled “The Word of Nietzsche: ‘God is Dead,’” Heidegger insisted that “thinking begins only when we have come to know that reason, glorified for centuries, is the most stiff-necked adversary of thought.”

Unlike Nietzsche, who could identify with aspects of scientific method, at least in the study of language, Heidegger explicitly attacked science for assaulting nature. The “technological frenzy” of modern man treats nature—and human beings—only in terms of pure manipulation and thus manifests a “spiritual decline” in the West.21 For Heidegger, “agriculture is today a motorized food industry, in essence the same as the manufacture of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps, the same as the blockage and starvation of countries, the same as the manufacture of atomic bombs.”22 Faced with this moral sensibility—or lack thereof—many have denounced Heidegger for advocating an attitude of Gelassenheit, of “letting beings be.” His conflation of mechanized agriculture and death camps seems to be all too much in line with his own political self-interest as a former Nazi who never expressed any regret for his actions in the 1930s.23 His attack on modernity concealed an insensitivity with deeply disturbing moral implications.

Although writing in different eras, both Nietzsche and Heidegger attacked historicism and its central concern, man. History, they argued, did not unfold in linear fashion, revealing truth in the process of development over time, but rather moved through an arbitrary set of crises, disjunctures, and disruptions. Nothing necessarily followed from what came before, so causation should be pitched out along with human agency and social structuring. The historians who invented the myths of modernity could no more hope to be objective than any other social scientists. Human beings do not achieve a separation from the objects they study; they simply invest them with their own values. Thus along with modern history, the idea of the human being as an autonomous, subjectively willing, rational agent was brought into question. As Foucault said, Nietzsche killed man and God “in the interior of his language.”24 Heidegger, like Nietzsche before him, insisted that thinking always generates further complexity, further murkiness.

Foucault and Derrida endorsed many of these perspectives on history, but they cannot be described as disciples of Nietzsche and Heidegger in any usual sense. Nor did they do philosophy in the expected manner, even in the style of Nietzsche or Heidegger. Foucault composed a series of historical works on madness, medicine, prisons, and sexuality (among other topics) that aimed to show how the modern individual or self was produced by the disciplines and discourses of institutions. Derrida wrote essays that criticized thinkers from Plato to Foucault, arguing that all of them were trapped in the binary categories of Western metaphysics: good vs. evil, being vs. nothingness, truth vs. error, nature vs. culture, speech vs. writing. In order to draw attention to the straitjacket of Western literary and philosophical expectations, Derrida deliberately upset the conventions of writing with his unusual typography, constant flow of neologisms, and strange titles (The Postcard: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond; “wriTing, encAsIng, screeNing”). What the two authors shared was an emphasis on the effects of language, or what Foucault called discourse. Discourse produced knowledge, not the other way around. Thus Foucault and Derrida opened up the possibility that the search for truth itself might be seen as the prime Western illusion.

Some might argue that neither Foucault nor Derrida should be read as relativist because neither posited a subject who might hold a subjective position (you cannot be a relativist unless you occupy a position that is relative to others). Both aimed to decenter the subject, that is, question her or his primacy as a location for making judgments and seeking truth. They challenged the entire Enlightenment project that rested on a concept of autonomous subjectivity. Foucault in particular, although at moments respectful of the eighteenth century’s search for a new foundation for knowledge, urged rebellion from it in the form of a practical critique of reason that “takes the form of a possible transgression.”25 In many ways, then, their critiques of the subject and of language fostered a deeper skepticism about the (disappearing) self and truth.

Foucault made truth nothing more than the will to power within discourse, whereas Derrida questioned the enterprise of seeking something called “truth” in the face of the endless play of signifiers. Although their approaches were radically different and in some respects opposite, both aimed to deconstruct truth as a value in the West.26 The influence of such views can be seen in many places. In criticizing a biography of Foucault, which dealt explicitly with his homosexuality, one disciple argued, “‘Truth,’ then, is not the opposite of error; ‘truth’ is a discursive strategy that (among other things) blocks inquiry into the conditions—dynamic and erotic—of its own production.”27

Language thus stands as an insuperable barrier to truth. Foucault and Derrida depict human beings as caught in a prison of language, a prison even more confining than the economic determinism attributed to Marx or the psychological determinism of Freud. Marx and Freud, after all, believed themselves to be scientists capable of establishing an objective relationship to historical or psychological reality, which was open to further elaboration. They believed that their theories gave them a vantage point on reality—and a means for transforming it. Foucault and Derrida reject this kind of fix on reality and with it the possibility of an objectivity predicated upon the separation of the self and the object of knowledge. They deny any direct, personal relation to the reality of the world out there because reality is the creature of language.

Foucault and Derrida built upon the fundamental work of Ferdinand de Saussure on the nature of language.28 At the beginning of the twentieth century, Saussure’s work suggested that language provides no direct access to reality because it itself is based on difference and distance, beginning with the essential difference between the signifier (the sound or appearance of the word) and the mental signified (the meaning or concept of the word). Signifier and signified are not the same; the word “s-n-o-w” is not snow itself but rather a representation or signifier of the tiny white frozen crystals we call snow. The signifier represents the signified, but is not identical to it, and in the process of representation lies the possibility for veiling, distortion, obfuscation. Language is constructed on the basis of difference, on the relationship of signifier to signified and of words to each other, not on the basis of a direct correspondence to reality. This can be seen if the usual contexts for snow are reversed. “The snow melted as the temperature dropped” is technically a sentence which nevertheless throws the reader into consternation about the meaning of snow.

Thus, it could be argued, reality, or what metaphysics called “presence” (logos, whether in the form of reality, presence, reason, or the Word of God), is never directly available to us. Reality is always shrouded by language, and the workings of language are in turn veiled by the operation of cultural codes.29 Derrida summed up his position in one of his typically elliptical pronouncements:





Whose discourse tells you: the column is this or that, is there…the column has no Being, nor any being-there, whether here or elsewhere. It belongs to no one…. And from this column’s not being (a being), from its not falling under the power of the is, all of Western metaphysics, which lives in the certainty of that is, has revolved around the column.30





In Derrida’s view, it can no longer be assumed that the truth of the signifier (the word, the column) is guaranteed by some transcendental meaning or prior truth (God, the mind, or the necessary correspondence between nature and language).

Derrida advocated a method of reading called deconstruction that aimed to show how all texts repressed as much as they expressed in order to maintain the fundamental Western conceit of “logocentrism,” the (erroneous) idea that words expressed the truth of reality. Deconstruction demonstrated that texts could be interpreted in multiple, if not infinite, ways because signifiers had no essential connection to what they signified. It is perhaps not surprising that French intellectuals who grew up during the Nazi occupation would find the metaphor of entrapment—or its antonym, total freedom—compelling; in Derrida’s terms, Westerners are wrong to believe that the column has Being, but they can’t give it up. And given the difficulties postwar French intellectuals faced in trying to find an exit from what they saw as the competing and hegemonic demands of American capitalism and Eastern-bloc communism—or liberal humanism and Marxism—it might be expected that they would be suspicious of easy proclamations of liberation or truth.

Once revealed as the creation of language and ideology, the self either stands exposed like a caged animal (Foucault) or disappears like smoke dissipating in the sky (Derrida). The single, individual identity is, in the postmodernists’ view, a historical creation whose days are limited. The self does not speak language; language speaks through the self, just as Heidegger had maintained. The very idea of the author, Foucault concluded, was the creation of the same discourses of the seventeenth and eighteenth century that insisted more generally on personal responsibility. The reading of a text, according to Derrida, has “nothing to do with the author as a real person.”31 The author, along with the idea of “man,” would disappear with the passing of time because it was a cultural artifact.

The influence of postmodernism among late-twentieth-century historians would have remained entirely marginal—the stuff of philosophical disputation—if the discipline of history had not been changing. Crucial to the change was the entering wedge of relativism and skepticism. As early as the 1930s, the American Progressive historians Carl Becker and Charles Beard raised the clarion call of historical relativism by insisting that every man (their term) would write his own history. They seemed to imply that since every man had his own version of history, history functioned as a cultural myth rather than as an objective account of the past (a position not far from Nietzsche’s). They argued that the ideal of a definitive, objective reconstruction of the past was chimerical. Facts did not present themselves directly to the historian; the historian picked and chose among them, guided by his ideological presuppositions. In Beard’s words, the historian performed “an act of faith,” based on “subjective decision, not a purely objective discovery.”32 Thus, not long after historians had established their discipline as an autonomous field of study emulating scientific methods of research, belief in its scientific status and capacity for objectivity began to waver.

But these were faint murmurs compared to the muscular expansion of Marxism, the Annales school, and modernization theory, which after World War II became competing paradigms in the organization of ever-larger chunks of global research. Criticism of these enterprises remained dormant until the 1970s and 1980s, when it began to explode, detonated in part by the democratization of the university. Groups only recently admitted to the university proved especially receptive to skeptical postmodernist claims, having seen that leading representatives of all three major schools of history had left women and minorities out of their accounts or had treated them in stereotypical ways. Even though individual social historians held tenaciously to a model of objective scholarship, the results of their research also reinforced the postmodernist disaggregation of all unitary interpretive schemes. The history of what postmodernists called “subaltern” groups—workers, immigrants, women, slaves, and gays—in fact proved difficult to integrate into the story of one American nation. How could the tragic stories of the lives of slaves, for example, be incorporated into a single narrative governed by optimism and progress? Social history, once the great hope of an increasingly inclusive and yet scientifically minded profession, seemed inadequate to the task of offering a new, gendered, and inclusive narrative.





The Rise of Cultural History



Within the context of universities more democratized than anything Beard or Becker could have imagined, cultural warfare erupted along a front running from history and literature to law and education. Indeed, among the human sciences, history fared better than most because until very recently, the methods and goals of social history rather than the philosophical dilemmas raised by postmodernism remained at the center of controversy. While debates about social history still dominated the headlines of historical controversy, some historians turned away from social history, now criticized as having failed to live up to its promise, and toward the history of culture. The mind as a repository of society’s prescriptions, as the site where identity is formed and reality linguistically negotiated, focused the new historical inquiry. There resided culture, defined as society’s repertoire of interpretive mechanisms and value systems.

The historian of culture sought to dig beneath the formal productions of law, literature, science, and art to the codes, clues, hints, signs, gestures, and artifacts through which people communicate their values and their truths. Most important, scholars began to see that culture particularizes meaning because cultural symbols are endlessly reshaped in everyday social encounters. Only insiders get access to the message; being inside the social loop of signals makes one a member of the group, be it a community, a class, a congregation, or a nation. This cultural point of view can, but need not, deny the universality of a conceptual language along with the uniformity of human reasoning. From a postmodernist perspective, however, cultural history could be used to further the attack on reason and universal human values.

In the cultural perspective, a different view of rationality comes into play, one which stresses that human reason operates within a specific cultural context. People think within the parameters of their mental universe; they cannot catapult out of that universe in order to form independent judgments about it. Within a mental universe they can, however, arrive at scientific or moral truths that are accessible to people in different mental universes. Nothing in the cultural perspective necessarily supports the notion that languages are incommensurable, having no common meaning to people who did not initially partake in their formulation. The new cultural history still reflected developing interest in uncovering the social or contextual sources of motive and action discussed in our earlier chapters on American history and the history of science. But whereas historians, modernization theorists, and Annalistes alike pressed economics and sociology into service, cultural historians turned to anthropology and literary theory.

“Culture” is a notoriously loose term, and anthropologists have long debated its meaning. During the 1970s and 1980s, the anthropologist most often cited by historians was Clifford Geertz. In his wonderfully provocative essay “Thick Description,” Geertz insisted that “culture is not a power, something to which social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally attributed; it is a context, something within which they can be intelligibly—that is, thickly—described.”33 Anthropology, with this emphasis on an intelligibility derived from extensive contextualization, came to be an interpretive science in search of meaning rather than an experimental one in search of laws. Geertz thus explicitly rejected the positivist scientific model in favor of an increasingly literary model of cultural criticism. His position had obvious affinities to those advanced by postmodernists such as Foucault and Derrida.

Many cultural historians soon jumped on the interpretive bandwagon. Historians proclaimed the advantages of “history in the ethnographic grain,” for it seemed to offer a way of interpreting the meaning people in the past ascribed to their experiences. A recent study has shown that between 1976 and 1990, studies of French history shifted decisively away from political and social history toward intellectual and cultural history, no doubt reflecting a general trend.34 The emphasis on decoding meaning, rather than inferring causal laws of explanation, was taken to be the central task of cultural history, just as Geertz had named it the central task of cultural anthropology.35

The increasing interest in culture and cultural theory came originally from theoretical sources and historical trends other than postmodernism. Primary among them was disenchantment with explaining everything in economic and social terms—what is often called economic and social reductionism. The emphasis on culture implied that people’s beliefs and ritual activities interacted with their economic and social expectations and did not simply mirror their socioeconomic situations. In the United States, the growing awareness that American culture included many different and sometimes competing subcultures also fostered an interest in the history of culture. In response to these trends, the very models of explanation that most contributed to the rise of social history in the first place went through a major shift of emphasis in the 1970s and 1980s. Turning first to theorists of culture within their own ranks, Marxists and Annalistes alike became increasingly captivated by the history of culture. Even diehard modernization theorists placed increasing emphasis on cultural factors.

Marxist attention to cultural forms was inspired by the work of Antonio Gramsci, a founder of the Italian Communist Party who wrote down his thoughts in a series of prison notebooks in the 1920s and 1930s. Gramsci’s most influential concept was that of “hegemony,” the idea that an elite can establish its power only if it exerts a cultural domination over other social classes. Material strength alone cannot give a group power; it must also develop the means to exercise cultural and intellectual leadership. Thus the working class could come to power only if it could set up its own independent culture, “its own original conception of the world.”36 Gramsci’s emphasis on culture, which only gradually spread in Marxist circles after World War II, was evident in E. P. Thompson’s pioneering and influential history of the English working class. Thompson explicitly devoted himself to the study of what he called “cultural and moral mediations” and “the way these material experiences are handled…in cultural ways.”37

Other influences also pushed Marxists toward an interest in culture, from the work of the literary critic Raymond Williams in Great Britain to the studies of the Frankfurt school of critical theory in Germany. In France, Louis Althusser explicitly tried to reorient Marxism in a poststructuralist direction by arguing that Marx’s own work showed that the notion of an actively willing, freely acting human subject was only the product of bourgeois ideology. Many historians in the British Marxist tradition, including Thompson, drew back from the more extreme postmodernist positions associated with the cultural turn, viewing them as a threat to historical materialism. Thompson explicitly attacked Althusser for denying human beings a role in the shaping of their own historical destiny.38 He and his many followers worried that postmodernism, especially with its emphasis on discourse, stood aloof from real history by wrenching language loose from social reality. One especially vociferous Marxist critic denounced “writing that appears under the designer label of poststructuralism / postmodernism” as trivializing, academic wordplaying that promotes a kind of solipsistic navel-gazing rather than serious intellectual work.39

An alternative Marxist approach to culture has been proposed by the French sociologist and anthropologist Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu recast the Marxist model by giving more attention to culture as a set of practices used differently by different social groups. Though he insisted that “the mode of expression characteristic of a cultural production always depends on the laws of the market in which it is offered,” he directed his own work to uncovering the “specific logic” of “cultural goods.”40 Central to this logic are the ways and means of appropriating cultural objects. In contrast to Foucault, who underlined the effects of a general discursive field, Bourdieu drew attention to the importance of social distinctions in the uses of culture, and reaffirmed the vitality of social history.

The turn toward cultural history has been even more enthusiastic in the Annales school, whose younger members have grown increasingly disenchanted with Braudel’s original paradigm of levels of historical experience. First evident in a preoccupation with what the French rather enigmatically called mentalités, the Annalistes’ embrace of culture focused on the collectively shared mental practices or structures of a society.41 As a label, mentalité served to set off cultural and mental life from the economic, social, or demographic processes that had previously occupied Annales historians.

For the new generation of the Annales school, mentalités or culture could no longer be characterized as part of the “third level” of historical experience. In their view, the third level is not a level at all but a primary determinant of historical reality, because mental structures cannot be reduced to material elements. Economic and social relations are not prior to or determining of cultural ones; they are themselves fields of cultural practice and cultural production. In this view, cultural practices cannot be explained deductively by reference to an extracultural dimension of experience. All practices, whether economic or cultural, depend on the cultural or mental representations or codes that individuals use to make sense of their world.42

The new generation of Annalistes and their counterparts elsewhere did not simply propose a new set of topics for investigation; rather their approach to culture raised questions about the methods and goals of history generally. Although the concept of culture need not preclude an interest in social and economic explanations, a belief in reality, or a practice grounded on empiricism, the concept does pose fundamental problems about historical explanation when elevated to the status of the prime force in historical change. If ready assumptions about the social and economic causes of events are thrown out, what will take their place? If all practices are culturally and linguistically inscribed, if all meaning, even the meaning of scientific laws, depends on cultural context, then how can any causal explanation be derived? (Geertz seemed to suggest that it could not and should not.) As often happens with sudden enthusiasms, culture as a category ran the risk of encompassing everything and thus, in a sense, explaining nothing; what can it mean to say that everything is due to culture? Should historians concentrate on offering thick descriptions and forget about causal analysis? In this way, the challenge to materialist reductionism (explaining action by reference to economic and social factors or causes) turned into a challenge to causal explanation itself. When swimming in culture, neither causes nor effects could be distinguished. As a consequence, cultural history and the philosophical issues of relativism and skepticism began to intersect and reinforce each other.





Postmodernism and Historians



At first glance, it might seem unlikely that either Foucault or Derrida would have much influence on the practice of history. Both of them argued vehemently against any research into origins (perhaps the classic historical approach to any problem), and both advanced methods of discourse analysis that required none of the usual forms of grounding in economics, society, or politics. Both consequently have been accused of fostering nihilism. While Derrida seemed to offer no motive at all for the play of language, the only consistent “cause” cited by Foucault for the formation of discourses was the Nietzschean will to power, usually expressed through institutions, rather than by individuals.43 Foucault’s definition of his work as a history of the conditions for the “production of truth” thus risked reducing all truth, and all his historical explanations of it, to an all-encompassing will to power—in many ways, the opposite of Derrida’s motiveless play of language. In either rendering, women and men are stripped of the meaningful choices whose reality had once served to distinguish human beings from animals. Change comes about through unexpected and unpredictable slips in the fault lines of broad discursive configurations, through lucky breaks in the war of all against all, not through self-determined human action.

Despite much resistance to postmodernism, it has gained ground through the rising influence of literary theory in all forms of cultural studies in the last two decades. In the 1980s, Geertz pointed anthropologists in this direction by linking his “interpretive theory” to what he called “the Text analogy…the broadest of the recent refigurations of social theory.”44 In the “text analogy,” culture is likened to a text or language. Like a text, it has to be studied as something in itself rather than as a transparent representation of some more basic set of codes such as economic or social trends. If culture is like a text or language, then it is presumably susceptible to all the criticisms leveled by Foucault and Derrida.

All historians of culture must grapple with how to relate the cultural artifact—text, painting, or steam engine—with the other beliefs, knowledge systems, interests, and structures affecting the human agents who gave rise to it. But postmodern theories of interpretation invariably go further than simply insisting on the integrity of the cultural artifact. They challenge all endeavors to relate culture (or discourse or text) to something outside or beneath it, either to nature or material circumstances, and in so doing they undermine the traditional foundations of knowledge claims in both the natural and the human sciences. If postmodern theories are taken seriously, there is no transhistorical or transcendent grounds for interpretation, and human beings have no unmediated access to the world of things or events.45 Taken at its word, postmodernism means that there can be no straightforward passageway to the world outside the text, nor, by implication perhaps, any access to the text by peoples or cultures foreign to it. “Beauty” like “truth” like “reality” would lie in the “eye,” as it were, of language. Neither reality nor the individual knower stands outside of the cultural construction. The world, the knower, and knowledge are all profoundly relativized and cut off from the social processes that grind or swirl wordlessly around the bearer of culture. In this rendering, scientific knowledge becomes simply another linguistic convention, a form of discourse related to the excessively rationalist form of life in the West.

Reactions to postmodernist theories within history have varied widely. Traditionalists reject the new forms of theory just as they rejected all previous forms of theory as unnecessary, even unhealthy, intrusions into the domain of history. Social historians have resisted cultural theory as too removed from concrete social conditions, though in some instances social historians have themselves moved to embrace the new theories. As is so often the case with an academic discipline, the introduction of new theories has served to divide scholars into opposing camps. Our view is that the new cultural theories, including postmodernist ones, have helped, like their predecessors, to revitalize discussion about methods, goals, and even the foundations of knowledge. Provocative and unsettling, they raise questions that demand some new answers.

Some academic feminists have found postmodernist theories congenial because such theories underline the contingency, the human-madeness, and hence the changeability of cultural norms and practices. In the United States, in particular (and perhaps uniquely), women’s history and gender studies have been at the forefront of the new cultural history. Feminist historians pioneered the use of anthropological insights, and now some of them are in the vanguard of those who utilize postmodern theories. The very notion of gender shows the influence of the cultural and linguistic term in the humanities. From its origins as a term of grammar, gender has come to refer in English increasingly to the cultural and social construction of sexual identity. In her influential collection of essays Gender and the Politics of History, Joan Wallach Scott insisted that “a more radical feminist politics” required “a more radical epistemology,” which she found in postmodernist theory. Citing the approaches of Foucault and Derrida as models, she praised postmodernist theory for relativizing the status of all knowledge.46

The issues raised by the feminist use of postmodernist theory are characteristic of the debate about the text analogy and postmodernist theory more generally. Central to the debate has been the blurring of the distinction between text and context (or between language and the social world). Classic social theory rested on a heuristic separation of text and context. Something was taken as the thing to be explained (the text, the effect, or the dependent variable), such as the rise of capitalism, the workings of bureaucratic rationalization, or the increasing impersonality in modern society; something else was posited as the means of explanation (the context, the cause, or the independent variable), e.g., the Protestant work ethic, the spread of markets, or the increasing differentiation of functions in modern society. Denying the possibility of any separation of text and context (or cause and effect), postmodernist theory jeopardizes all social theorizing.

If postmodernist cultural anthropology is any guide, the concern with developing causal explanations and social theories would be replaced in a postmodernist history with a focus on self-reflexivity and on problems of literary construction: how does the historian as author construct his or her text, how is the illusion of authenticity produced, what creates a sense of truthfulness to the facts and a warranty of closeness to past reality (or the “truth-effect” as it is sometimes called)?47 The implication is that the historian does not in fact capture the past in faithful fashion but rather, like the novelist, gives the appearance of doing so. Were this version of postmodernism applied to history, the search for truths about the past would be displaced by the self-reflexive analysis of historians’ ways of fictively producing convincing “truth-effects.” Similarly, people in the past who believed themselves to be engaged in the search for truth would have to be either indulged or disabused by the historian, their futile struggle seen to be analogous to the odyssey to which any superstition or self-delusion consigns its believers.48 Relativism, possibly tinged with cynicism or arrogance, would characterize the historian’s aesthetic stance toward such people, becoming the alternative to and replacement for respect. In the face of their myopia or futile discursive strategies, the ironic voice would overshadow the historian’s wonder, presenting the passion to linger among human beings struggling to find truths as a quest for their “truth-effects.”

Under the impact of postmodernist literary approaches, historians are now becoming more aware that their supposedly matter-of-fact choices of narrative techniques and analytical forms also have implications with social and political ramifications. Essays on the state of the discipline often have a canonical form all their own: first a narrative of the rise of new kinds of history, then a long moment for exploring the problems posed by new kinds of history, followed by either a jeremiad on the evils of new practices or a celebration of the potential overcoming of all obstacles. The literary form that the argument takes has a very strong influence on the way that evidence and arguments are presented.

Authors of essays about the “new history” in the early twentieth century or about social history in the 1950s and 1960s often wrote in heroic and romantic terms of the advance of social and economic history, with the brave historian marching hand in hand with the forces of progress and democracy to do battle with backwardness and tradition. More recently, the ironic mode has become dominant among those historians, who, like other cultural critics, have wondered whether their work could ever be other than fragmentary and partial, with little relevance to the grander narratives of the past. Despairing of the validity of what they describe as macrohistories, they embrace irony and claim only to be writing microhistories.

Questions of form or technique justifiably extend to the chapters in this volume. In our emphasis on the need for narrative coherence, causal analysis, and social contextualization, as exemplified in our own narratives, we are attempting to go beyond the current negative or ironic judgments about history’s role. We as historians are nonetheless making our own aesthetic choices, just as others have chosen comedy, romance, or irony for their writings. We are emphasizing the human need for self-understanding through a coherent narrative of the past and the need for admittedly partial, objective explanations of how the past has worked. In this sense, we have renounced an ironic stance.49 Rather than try to prove our superiority to past historians by focusing on their failures, we are trying to learn from their efforts to make sense of the social world. Rather than underlining the impossibility of total objectivity or completely satisfying causal explanation, we are highlighting the need for the most objective possible explanations as the only way to move forward, perhaps not on a straight line of progress into the future, but forward toward a more intellectually alive, democratic community, toward the kind of society in which we would like to live.

These are aesthetic or literary choices because they involve ways of organizing a narrative, but history is more than a branch of letters to be judged only in terms of its literary merit. Our choices are political, social, and epistemological. They are political and social because they reflect beliefs in a certain kind of community of historians and society of Americans. They are epistemological because they reflect positions on what can be known and how it can be known. With diligence and good faith they may also be at moments reasonably, if partially, true accounts of the distant and recent past.

The assumption of a clear hierarchy of explanation running from economy and society up to politics and culture was present in the Annales school, Marxism, and modernization theory, and it can still be seen in the table of contents of many social history monographs. We agree that the focus on culture and language undermines this hierarchical view by showing that all social reality is culturally constructed and discursively construed in the first instance. Culture can no longer be considered a phenomenon of “the third level” in Annales terms, if the “basics” of life (demography, economy) are themselves constructed in and through culture. In that sense, discursive or linguistic models throw into doubt the once absolutist forms of conventional historical explanation, and they thereby open up the way to new forms of historical investigation. Foucault’s own work is perhaps the best-known example of such a new form with direct historical relevance.

We are not, therefore, rejecting out of hand everything put forward by the postmodernists. The text analogy and aspects of postmodernist theories have some real political and epistemological attractions. The interest in culture was a way of disengaging from Marxism, or at least from the most unsatisfactory versions of economic and social reductionism. Cultural and linguistic approaches also helped in the ongoing task of puncturing the shield of science behind which reductionism often hid. By focusing on culture, one could challenge the virtually commonsensical assumption that there is a clear hierarchy of explanation in history (that is, in all social reality), running from biology and topography through demography and economics up to social structure and finally to politics and its poor cousins, cultural and intellectual life.

Yet postmodernism has also raised its own set of concerns, just as every previous theoretical intervention did. Chief among them has been the problem of linguistic determinism or conflation, the reduction of the social and natural world to language and context to text. If historians give up the analogies of levels (the Annales school) or base-superstructure (Marxism), must they also give up social theory and causal language altogether? Paradoxically, as theory has developed from the days of Hegel and Marx, one trajectory that went from Nietzsche and Heidegger and on to the postmodernists has progressively shed any ambition to explain. As the exponents of that trajectory take aim at history, its original theoretical and empirical project, the explanation of long-term social and political development, then comes under attack. In other words, postmodernism throws into question the modern narrative form, proving once again that the philosophy of history does matter.





The Problem of Narrative



Philosophical questions about epistemological foundations inevitably touch upon the narrative form that gives cohesion to history as a discipline. Narrative continues to be fundamental, albeit in different ways, to history as a form of knowledge about human life, even though few professional historians now write what was classically known as narrative history—grand panoramic stories about the emergence of a new nation or major crises that threatened national identity. Despite the decline of grand narratives, history has retained a strong narrative cast, even in the most specialized monographs of social and cultural history. Like memory itself, every work of history has the structure of a plot with a beginning, middle, and end, whether the subject is social mobility in a nineteenth-century American city, the uses of art as propaganda in the Russian Revolution, or the analysis of the rise of postmodernist theory in historical writing. Thus, to argue for a return to narrative, as some traditionalists have done, is to miss the cardinal point that historians have never entirely departed from it.50

Not surprisingly, “narrative” has become one of the charged code words of the current struggles over history. Those who resist the changes in the discipline, including the rise of social history, tend to defend narrative as the form of writing specific to history, while those who champion disciplinary innovation tend to demean narrative as an unsophisticated form of writing about the past or as simply another version of fiction camouflaged as history. More important than this essentially superficial debate about the place of narrative within the profession (superficial because it focuses on the most immediately evident form of writing rather than on its deeper significance) is the question of what have been called meta-narratives or master narratives.

A meta-narrative or master narrative is a grand schema for organizing the interpretation and writing of history. In earlier chapters we described three of the most important meta-narratives of modern history: the heroic model of progress through science, the epic of an unfolding American nation, and the idea of the “modern.” Marxism, liberalism, even postmodernism itself are all examples of meta-narratives, for they all offer sweeping stories about the origins of American and Western problems and the direction that lives may take in the present, as well as remedies for the future. Of these philosophies of history, only postmodernism attacks meta-narrative along with the narrative form itself as inherently ideological and hence obfuscating. In the postmodernist view, present in the works of Foucault and Derrida, among others, history in general and narrative in particular are denounced as “representational practices” by which Western societies produced individuals especially well suited to life in a postindustrial state.51 (It isn’t entirely clear why this is a bad thing.)

At best, in this line of postmodernist argument, narrative and meta-narrative are useful fictions for modern industrial society, nothing more. At worst, they are insidious ways of hiding the partiality and propaganda aims of the author of the narrative and the normalizing tendencies of modern states and societies. For some postmodernists, all meta-narratives are inherently totalitarian. They cannot, by this overarching analysis, be in any sense true. One postmodernist proclaimed, “History is the Western myth.”52 In place of plot and character, history and individuality, perhaps even meaning itself, the most thorough-going postmodernists would offer an “interminable pattern without meaning,” a form of writing closer to modern music and certain modern novels.53

In the most extreme form of the postmodernist critique of narrative, special scorn is reserved for those who write for an “ordinary educated public,” since they turn the contradictions, political forces, and ideological tensions of history into “disthought,”54 that is, a form of propaganda for the status quo. This is the ultimate reductio ad absurdum of postmodernist criticisms of history-writing. Such critics take to heart the postmodernist notion that history is irrelevant to identity (a position not shared, by the way, by Foucault, who attributed all identity to historical processes). They deny that story or narrative is one of the major ways in which human intelligence ascribes meaning to life. For them, the entire historiographical tradition simply fosters “a consciousness that is never able to arrive at criticism.”55 Narrative and critical thinking are incompatible.

Several different levels of argument are involved in these condemnations of meta-narratives: historiography as the tradition of history writing over time; narrative as a form of historical writing; and storytelling as a form of ascribing meaning to social life. The most extreme postmodernist position denies the validity of all of them at once. Meta-narrative is denounced as myth, historiography dismissed as “a mode of bureaucraticideological organization,” narrative as a form of propaganda, and story or plot (beginning-middle-end as an essential way of viewing action in the world) as part of the “myth that history is a condition of knowledge.” It is less clear, however, what such critics would have historians do instead, except, perhaps, that they ought not to write history at all or admit that in the end history is another form of fiction.56 As one contemporary philosopher puts the objection to this kind of nihilistic criticism, “deconstruction without reconstruction is irresponsibility.”57

No one argues any longer, as Ranke seemed to do, that historical narrative in any way exactly mirrors past reality, “as it actually was.” Historians cannot capture the fullness of past experience, any more than individual memories can; they only have the traces or residues of the past, and their accounts are necessarily partial. Even those who argue that narrative structure inheres in the events themselves and that narration actually constitutes action and experience grant that historical narratives do not simply mirror or reproduce the firsthand experience of reality.58

Although most historians continue to believe that narrative is a universal mode of organizing human knowledge, others have questioned this position. One previous defender of narrative recently concluded that master narratives and narrative itself might be tainted with “the guilt of culture and history.” He speculated that the death of history, politics, and narrative might all be aspects of another great transformation, similar in scope and effect to that which marked the initial emergence of Greek thought.59 Similarly, it has been argued that postmodern narrative will no longer rely on the time of Newton, “the time of history…the time of clocks and capital.” Instead, it will collapse the subject and object of knowledge and with it the distinction between “invention and reality.”60

It is probably impossible to develop an airtight defense of narrative and meta-narrative (in Newtonian time). One commentator recently acknowledged, “There is no global defense of the narrative form that will insulate it, once and for all, from skeptical doubts.”61 Similarly, philosophical efforts to define precisely the workings of causal analysis in historical explanation have become hopelessly entangled in debates about general laws of explanation and history’s relationship to the natural sciences. If the nature of the particles that make up physical reality is up for grabs in contemporary philosophical and scientific thought, then the concept of a once-lived reality in the past and its relation to historical representations is even more vexed. Yet the mere existence of questions and doubts does not prove the inherent falseness of the narrative form with its incorporation of causal language.

We see no reason to conclude that because there is a gap between reality and its narration (its representation), the narration in some fundamental sense is inherently invalid. Just because narratives are human creations does not make them all equally fictitious or mythical. In our last two chapters, we will examine the ways in which historians determine the truth or falseness of their narrative creations. Suffice it to say for now that in our view, narrative is essential both to individual and social identity. It is consequently a defining element in history-writing, and the historiographical tradition, as we have reviewed it briefly here, is an important element in identity, both for historians in a profession and for citizens in modern societies. We believe that historians must try to develop new and better social theories or new and better meta-narratives, even while making problematic their old ones. Just as the meta-narrative of progress replaced that of Christianity in the West, so too it is possible to believe that people will want to develop new meta-narratives in order to prepare for the future. New experiences will always require new interpretations and new explanations.

Postmodernism is in fact one such meta-narrative, and many commentators have pointed to its unstated reliance on a narrative of modernism to make its point. As one historian reminds us, to proclaim the end of historical meta-narratives is itself “a (quite totalizing) piece of historical narrative.”62 Rejecting all meta-narratives cannot make sense, because narratives and meta-narratives are the kinds of stories that make action in the world possible. They make action possible because they make it meaningful. Postmodernism offers another interpretation of meaning, including historical meaning, even as it claims to contest the foundations of all meanings. There is no action without a story about how the world works, and action is all the more deliberative if the stories are all the more theorized. The stories will always be changing (they are in fact stories about how change works), but historians will always have to tell them in order to make sense of the past, and it matters whether they tell them well—as truthfully and fully as possible—or not.

The move toward the most radically skeptical and relativist postmodern position inevitably leads into a cul-de-sac. Dismissals of history, politics, and narrative as hopelessly modern ideas, now outmoded in the postmodern world, might seem up-to-date, but history, politics, and narrative are still the best tools available for dealing with the world and preparing for the future. A similar kind of crisis that foreshadows a turning away from the postmodern view can be seen in almost every field of knowledge or learning today. Postmodern art often consists of critiques of the function of art and especially past art (the mounds of shopping carts piled around the statue of Mozart in downtown Salzburg, for instance, in the year of the Mozart bicentenary) rather than new art. Similarly, postmodern history too often seems to consist of denunciations of history as it has been known rather than of new histories for present and hence future time. Periodic exercises in theory have an undeniably useful function as criticism of unself-conscious assumptions about art or history or science, but postmodernism cannot provide models for the future when it claims to refuse the entire idea of offering models for the future. In the final analysis, then, there can be no postmodern history. We turn now to the task of elaborating models for the future of history, models for understanding the search for historical truths within the framework of a revitalized and transformed practice of objectivity.
