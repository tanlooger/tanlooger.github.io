title: 5 Discovering the Clay Feet of Science
---







OF ALL THE CERTAINTIES inherited from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the heroic model of science has proved to be the most enduring. Even radicals and skeptics considered science an essential tool in the dismantling of old absolutisms. Throughout most of this century, American historians in the Progressive tradition, from Beard and his followers to the new social historians of the 1960s, found an ally in pure science. With methods they labeled scientific, the twentieth-century reformers of the American historical consciousness shattered old icons about the nation. The result has been the creation of competing, multicultural visions of the American past.

Understandably, those with a liberal or reformist persuasion recoiled at dismantling the model of science which had served them so well. For a long time the intellectual and material benefits derived from science appeared so unmitigated by bad side effects, unintended consequences, or environmentally dangerous applications that the heroic model of value-free science seemed the only way to guarantee the certainty of knowledge about the human condition, past or present. Then, rather suddenly, the reticence to criticize it vanished. In the postwar era the heroic model of science came undone.

In the history of Western science, as in much else, Hiroshima marked a major and frightening turning point. In the decades that followed, nuclear science, cloaked in the mantle of disinterest and neutrality, served the interests of all Cold Warriors while the nuclear scientists and bomb-builders worked for any government that needed them. To no one’s surprise, at the end of the Cold War some nuclear scientists and technologists faced with imminent unemployment seemed capable of taking their skills to any tyrant or potentate, or simply to the highest bidder. As military goals came increasingly to shape the contours of postwar science and technology, people became anxious about the uses to which the new technology might actually be put.1 To the fear of nuclear war was added concern about environmental damage. In this menacing setting, the notion of value-free science, ready to be taken up by whatever government or cause, seemed not just amoral but potentially immoral.

Cold War anxieties and disillusionment with the heroic image of science encouraged historians and philosophers to interrogate scientists and their practices. Immediately after World War II, historians of science, many of whom had seen war service, resumed their investigations with the encouragement of the scientists. But the history of science now took on a new mission. Some of its promoters had also been at the very center of the American wartime effort to build the nuclear bomb. With the end of the war the question became who would control nuclear technology. In 1945 many feared that if nuclear science and technology were not brought under firm civilian control, the power of the military might undermine democracy, scientific freedom, and international stability. Among the four or five most important American administrators of the American wartime nuclear program was the chemist and president of Harvard, James B. Conant. With various liberal allies he joined a national campaign to promote the civilian control of nuclear power. Scientists like Conant did not want to see postwar nuclear policy set secretly by the military; they also wanted to foster international cooperation and arms control. Within the framework of these prescriptions, a citizenry knowledgeable about science through its history would become indispensable supporters of Conant’s cause.

From the podium provided by the presidency of Harvard University, Conant made the case for civilian control and scientific freedom along with a revitalized study of the history of science. Science had to be made accessible if it was to be understood. Its traditions and rational procedures had to be appreciated by laymen, whose task in a democracy was to exert firm civilian control over all matters in domestic and foreign policy. Recognizing that much of twentieth-century science was so complicated as to be daunting, Conant urged that science be taught to nonspecialists through its history. He called for the creation of whole new disciplines to study science and to teach about its centuries of achievement to a new postwar generation of American undergraduates.

Led by the Harvard initiative, the history, sociology, and philosophy of science emerged after 1945 as distinct disciplines with new departments established at a number of major universities. At Harvard, historical case studies were used in courses about science in order to illustrate its extraordinary progress. In other universities, history departments once content to teach nothing but political, diplomatic, and military history hired their token historian of science. In the 1970s the history of technology also emerged as a distinct discipline.

At the heart of Conant’s vision for the history of science lay value-free, progressive science. That model prevailed in most history of science courses right into the 1960s. In the previous decade, John U. Nef, a leading historian of industrialization, explained that Western science alone could be distinguished “from all science of the past…[by] the rigour with which the scientists have confined themselves in their inquiries…to the objective analysis and examination of matter, space, time and motion.” For Nef the freedom of the human spirit “was the principal power behind the scientific revolution.”2 His contemporary the Cambridge University historian Herbert Butterfield insisted that the history of science should be the bridge between the arts and the sciences. In 1948 he offered a series of general lectures about the Scientific Revolution to students at Cambridge and assured them that “since the rise of Christianity there is no landmark in history that is worthy to be compared with this.” He also believed that living in the postwar era gave the historian a unique understanding of the historical importance of science in Western culture since the eighteenth century. To this day Butterfield’s lectures remain the most readable general introduction to the Scientific Revolution that has been written in English.3

But by the 1970s everything Conant, Butterfield, and their generation had in mind when they urged that science be taught through its history had unraveled. Instead of illustrating the wonders of scientific rationality and objectivity—the obstacles met and conquered by the heroes of science—a new history of science challenged the heroic model. Some suspected that rather than making students more knowledgeable about the West’s most distinctive cultural achievements, Conant and his allies had unwittingly created a sinister Trojan horse concealing irreverent critics. Once released, they would trample irresponsibly through the academic groves and damage the reputation of the science in which Conant’s generation had so fervently believed.





The Kuhnian Trojan Horse



Ironically, it was one of Conant’s followers at Harvard, Thomas S. Kuhn, who brought the horse into the center of public controversy. A teacher in the new history of science curriculum there, Kuhn developed a thesis that relied upon social factors to help explain the origins of scientific revolutions. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, published in 1962 and prefaced by a statement from Conant, Kuhn argued that each scientific field is organized around an overarching, or paradigmatic, theory. In normal, everyday science the social networks and community experiences of scientists in laboratories and professional associations help reinforce the dominant paradigm. Sealed off in their working enclaves, scientists routinely try to explain away any anomalies that their research might turn up. Only when forced by mounting evidence to confront these anomalies will some scientists—they are always rare—make a sudden mental shift which permits them to break with normal science. This is how scientific revolutions occur. The paradigm shift, from one theory to another, permits scientists to break away from the assumptions taken for granted in old theory governing everyday normal science. Again according to Kuhn, social factors keep scientists tied to normal science, while theory shifts let them escape.

Nothing in this account seems either sinister or suggestive of a Trojan horse.4 But when it first appeared, Kuhn’s book was blamed for introducing the notion of social conditioning into the way in which scientists routinely proceed, and thus conceivably into the way they break with existing paradigms. In retrospect, it is possible to see Kuhn’s book as a sign of the times, an example of the growing effort, originally encouraged by Conant and others, to understand the nature of scientific knowledge because it had become increasingly and disturbingly important.

Notice what Kuhn’s book did and did not say. In the Kuhnian model, scientists most of the time are sequestered, not only from rival theories, but also away from larger social, economic, and political interests. In that situation and under the guiding influence of their paradigm, they routinely do normal science. Only a dramatic, theoretical innovation, the now famous paradigm shift, will shake them loose from their theoretical moorings and permit the emergence of new, revolutionary science. Kuhn did not say that these shifts occur in opposition to the methods of science or without regard for empirical work.

Kuhn did not intend to open the door to relativism. His model remained true to essentially realist assumptions about the relationship between what the scientist can know and how scientific laws mirror nature. For the classic philosophical realist, it is possible to imagine a tight, uncomplicated fit between the language of science and nature. In the Kuhnian model the paradigm shifts permit the scientist to adjust the angle from which the mirror is fixed on nature. The emphasis on paradigm shifts leaves the impression that at moments the mirrors can get a little fogged over by habits and clubbiness; but, in the Kuhnian model, science works because it corresponds to what is in nature, more or less. In contrast to a naive version of human knowing which conceives of the mind as a blank slate upon which sense data drawn from nature write, Kuhn saw the mind organized by theories, reinforced by social conventions. Kuhn did not believe, however, that the disclosure of the workings of theories or social conventions invalidated the scientific enterprise. It just made it a little more human.5

No amount of realism saved Kuhn from being blamed almost immediately for the rising skepticism about science. For even mentioning the social, he was accused of rendering the once objective into the hopelessly subjective. Because he said that scientific change is frequently the result of paradigm shifts made by small groups of scientists, critics said he made it seem that the “adoption of a new scientific theory is an intuitive or mystical affair, a matter for psychological description,” rather than a matter of evidence and logic, pure and simple.6 In the last thirty years The Structure of Scientific Revolutions has been translated into many languages and has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide. Kuhn’s sociological vision of science became synonymous with retreat from the heroic model of scientists with their special purchase on truth. That retreat was, however, neither swift nor steady. Before it occurred, one final philosophical barrier had to be breached.

In the eyes of Kuhn’s generation, the generation that fought and won World War II, heroic science had seemed both philosophically correct and morally necessary. Even the threat of nuclear destruction could not shake their conviction that science and its history provided, as Conant put it, “the basis for a better discussion of the ways in which rational methods may be applied to the study and solution of human problems.”7 As to what might be concluded from the history of twentieth-century nuclear science once the story got to the nuclear bomb, Conant assured Americans that its destructive power might just be “the price we pay for health and comfort and aids to learning in this scientific age.”8 Believing that science laid the foundations for progress and rationality in the West, Conant and his generation of historians and scientists were not about to sacrifice it on the altar of social explanations. As Western scientists had done ever since Descartes, believers in heroic science grouped behind the barrier provided by philosophy. They were convinced that the social represented the irrational, and that only the mantle provided by logic and reason, philosophically understood, would save science from contamination.





The Philosophical Armor of Heroic Science



Historians and scientists of the generation of Conant and Butterfield institutionalized the history of science in American universities because they believed that its history, as they understood it, underwrote the Enlightenment’s vision of science. They also possessed a powerful moral armor in academic philosophy as it was taught from the 1940s onward. Its positive approach to science stressed that science, alone among the various forms of human inquiry, worked because of an inherent rationality. At the core of science lay logical rules upon which a few of the early geniuses of science had first managed to stumble. Right into the 1980s, in some quarters of public and academic opinion the legend of science had it that “successive generations of scientists have filled in more and more parts of the Complete True Story of the World.”9 It had been that simple and that positive.

The roots of a positive philosophy of science go back to Comte and the early nineteenth century, but more immediately to Vienna during the 1920s. There, one of the most influential philosophers of science in this century, Karl Popper, first published on the logic of scientific discovery. Forced to flee Austria and Germany in the 1930s because of Nazi persecution, Popper and his philosophical associates went to major English-speaking universities on both sides of the Atlantic. From those institutional bases their positive vision of how science works influenced historians, many of whom had been combatants against the evil that Popper and his colleagues had fled.

Buoyed by Popper and his associates, the latter sometimes called logical positivists, these philosophers taught that only a positive—and we would argue an essentially ahistorical—understanding of science could reinforce the barrier of reason in a century where reason had been in short supply.10 Popper emphasized that cooperation among disinterested scientists makes for objective knowledge. If it cannot be falsified, this knowledge is true forever. In Popper’s telling, the job of the philosopher was to understand how the game of science is played, how the scientist probes “into the unknown reality behind the appearances, and [is] anxious to learn from mistakes.”11 Allied to science, the philosopher explicates the philosophical logic working in it. The logic of science is distinctive, and the discipline provided by scientific experimentation and mathematical reasoning rivets the mind on nature. The positive, unrelenting logic of science, the armor that girds Western truth-seeking, stands as the model for the methods of all other disciplines.

Popper’s faith in the logic of science had been forged amid a bitter reality. Throughout much of this century the assault on rationality has been associated, quite rightly, with totalitarian political systems. Popper and his fellow refugees from Nazism saw its irrationalities as further support for their belief in the intimate link between the neutrality of science and the possibility of rational thought and action. Only the Nazis, they believed, had sought to manipulate science, and they of course were the great enemies of both reason and objectivity. The point was not lost on British and American intellectuals of the 1940s. They had watched with horror as fascism took hold in the heart of scientifically advanced industrial countries. Suddenly the Western enterprise with its commitment to scientific rationality seemed fragile at best. Added to its fragility came the threat posed by Soviet communism. Both before and after the war, the emergence of communism and Nazism provided very good reasons for preserving every aspect of the Enlightenment legacy. The generation that fought against totalitarianism and won World War II needed heroic science. Because those of that generation knew that totalitarianism was inherently immoral and its premises irrational, they naturally believed that science in totalitarian societies could not be rational.

The generation of Conant, Butterfield, and Nef viewed science through lenses that had been focused by Popper and his followers. Some of these philosophers believed that the methods of science and in particular its search for the laws of nature could be transferred to the social sciences and to the study of history. Historians should look for the laws of historical development. As late as the 1960s, students in American graduate schools of history were asked to read articles about the nature of history’s “covering laws.” That no historian had ever been able to find a single historical law that worked universally left the logical positivists unmoved.12 Generally, and perhaps mercifully, most of them ignored history, regarding it as irrelevant to the task of explicating philosophically the rationality and neutrality of science. Their enterprise recalls the agenda set by those positivists of the nineteenth century, Comte and his followers. They too had named science—pure, simple, unadulterated—the last, positive stage of human inquiry.

Into the 1970s, Karl Popper was still arguing that the purpose of his philosophy of science had been to justify the rationality of science and to counter intellectual and moral relativism, which he saw as the main philosophical malady of the time. Popper worried about the renewed danger of relativism revived by Kuhn’s book and the implications drawn from it by a rising generation of social historians. Of course, Popper had always thought that historical arguments would lead to relativism, and here it was back again, alive and well (even if hiding in the Trojan horse) in the work of Thomas Kuhn.

Popper took the highest ground he could find against a social reading of science by appealing to metaphysics. Imagine the contempt in his voice when he said: “I do not regard methodology as an empirical discipline, to be tested, perhaps by the facts of the history of science.”13 So much for the social history of science, at least as far as Popper and his followers were concerned. Instead Popper wrapped science in a mantle he described as metaphysical realism. Scientific method rested on the rules of logic, on the testing of theories, not simply upon fact-gathering. The relative success or failure of any empirically focused exploration of natural phenomena did not determine the rationality of science.

When Popper invoked metaphysical realism, he was trying to move the terrain right out from under the feet of the new social history of science. But he also wanted to be sophisticated and cautious about the way he mounted his philosophical rescue operation. As seen in the earlier discussion of heroic science, philosophical realism lies at the heart of its claim to represent nature exactly in its laws. When the scientist speaks, whatever the vernacular, his words are really about the eternally true, or the eternally unfalsifiable in Popper’s important modification. Unlike all previous science, which barely deserves the name, true science depends upon the mirrors that the scientist flashes on the world.

But as Popper well knew, there are dangers in a naive version of the realist argument. What if accepted, everyday science gets it wrong and is overthrown by new, better science? Was Ptolemy doing bad science, or no science at all, when he postulated the earth in the center of the universe, an error which Copernicus and his followers caught only centuries later? Does progress in science render nonscientific everything that went before the latest discovery? To argue that science is nature in the sense that its laws correspond to what is actually going on in nature opens up as many philosophical problems as it seeks to close down.

Popper argued instead that the realism of science lies not in a naive correspondence between the empirically tested world and the mind of the scientist, but in the rules of logic, in falsification and verification. He preferred the term “metaphysical realism,” because it suggested a model of science evolving by its own internal logic—a logic that transcends history—and leaves open the question of just how tight the fit need be between the laws and the there out there. Placed in opposition to the social history of science, metaphysical realism claims that there are “purely scientific revolutions that are not connected with ideological revolutions.” In Popperian logic, ideology equals impurity, and both equal the illogical, and hence neither has anything to do with the actual thought processes of the scientist. Popper tried to save the scientific baby by taking it out of the historical water altogether before the skeptical social historians could come along and drown it in historicity. By contrast, we will argue that scientific revolutions are also ideological revolutions but that the ideological dimension does not undermine the validity of the scientific breakthrough. Science can be historically and socially framed and still be true.





The Generation of the 1960s



Right up to the 1960s the understanding of science taught in American universities had stayed close to the triumphant story told by Andrew Dickson White at Cornell in the 1890s. The history of science had been written by men with strong backgrounds in science and little training in historical methods. In the history of medicine up to the 1960s the situation was similarly skewed toward doctors who also practiced history. Then a new generation of young women and men came to White’s Cornell from the big East Coast cities, from parochial and public schools, from parents who had seen war service as ordinary soldiers, sometimes in segregated units, or who had immigrated from Eastern and Western Europe in this century. To their skepticism about elite culture was added the moral turmoil induced by the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. Professionalization accompanied democratization. In perhaps the final irony of all, science fell under the gaze of science-inspired historical methods wielded by a new generation more interested in writing true history than in preserving the truth of science.

In nearly every field the new social history described in Chapter 4 challenged and dethroned the inherited intellectual absolutisms. When the same thing happened in the history of science, an icon of Western culture was undermined. The challenge ignited a war, what we will call, in honor of the terminology used at the time, the War between the Internalists and the Externalists. The so-called Internalists took an essentially Popperian position with regard to science. Its historical development occurred as the result of empirical work and the unfolding of the rules of logic. Basically the history of science had nothing to do with the social. The heroes of science got put up on their pedestals because they were true heroes, smarter and more creative than everyone else.

Under the influence of social history, a new generation of so-called Externalist historians of science looked for the larger interests and values at work within communities of scientists. The Externalist position—the term misleadingly predetermines what is inside and what must therefore be outside—vastly extended the definition of the social. Whereas Kuhn confined it to networks of scientists, the generation of the 1960s made it the universe beyond the laboratory or university. With the battle cry “social context,” the Externalists took up arms against the Internalists. The war was waged, not surprisingly, around the pedestals of the scientific heroes.

Born under the shadow of the bomb, the generation of the 1960s took a very different approach to science from that of most of its predecessors, Kuhn included. Like the Progressive historians of an earlier era, they developed new methods and asked new questions in an effort to understand the role of interests and ideologies in the making of science. Given the strength of social history by the 1960s, the history of science, not surprisingly, took a turn toward the social, now broadly defined. In centuries where most men and more women were neither literate nor leisured, it was relatively easy to find the scientists among elites, sharing their social outlook and political interests. Looking in private letters and diaries, social historians of science found the heroes of science immersed in the power relations of their time, willing to adopt or abandon theories for many complex, and not always disinterested, reasons. The new social historians sought to understand scientists in relation to governments, churches, religious beliefs, political ideologies, even with regard to their gender identities and their material assets and property.

In the expanded social understanding of science associated with the Externalists, the interests, values, linguistic conventions, even pride and greed of scientists shaped their understanding of nature. In effect, the definition of what should be considered internal to science changed dramatically. The heroes of science tumbled off their pedestals, their statuesque feet upon closer inspection seemed more clay than marble. Perhaps Popper had been right after all. If those mirrors in the heads of the heroes and founders of Western science could be shown to have been made by society, surely all of human knowledge could be revealed as socially constructed. The position was paradoxically a remake of the older realist, mirrors-in-the-head version of the scientific mind common among the positivists. The positivists and Internalists said that the scientists had mirrors always trained on nature; the extreme Externalists said that if so, those mirrors were the products of society. Thus trapped in the thicket of linguistic conventions, modern science succeeds only by using words like “nature” and “society” in ways that are entirely the result of linguistic moves made by seventeenth-century scientists like Boyle and Newton. They invented the modern meaning of “nature,” and thereby tailor-made for themselves a world which they and their successors could in turn investigate.

Such a dramatic paradigm shift in the way historians understood science now requires inspection. The generation of Conant, Butterfield, and Nef would have been horrified by the gap that has opened between the few remaining defenders of heroic science and the social historians of science. Among Conant’s generation, the great teachers of the postwar history of science, Henry Guerlac, I. B. Cohen, and Richard Westfall, never imagined that their discipline could even remotely challenge the truth and status of science. In the 1950s they began programs to train the next generation to study science historically. But once again, history intervened and a process we have described as the democratization of higher education began in earnest. By the time their programs were well established an explosion had occurred in the demand for college teachers and hence in the number of graduate students seeking higher degrees. Once trained and placed in the academy, the rising generation of historians turned to the heroes.





Reevaluating the Heroes: Newton and Darwin



Beginning in the 1960s, historians of science began to put the great icons of heroic science back into their social context. Not surprisingly, they look remarkably different when placed under a broad, social lens. The seventeenth-century English scientist Robert Boyle turned out to have formulated his law of gases while deeply involved in political and religious issues.14 Worse still, his contemporary Isaac Newton was discovered in his laboratory practicing alchemy—nothing is as external to heroic science as magic—while a century and a half later Charles Darwin put together the theory of natural selection with one eye on the impoverished classes. The history that produced these findings was never what Conant, or even Kuhn, had in mind. It was close, however, to fulfilling Popper’s fear that the study of ideology at work in the mind of scientists would lead to philosophical relativism. Could science still be true when it resulted from such a messy, seemingly irrational process of thought?

Venturing into seventeenth-century England to discover the social lair inhabited by the great geniuses of science can be a formidable excursion. Concepts like “matter theory” or definitions of pantheism do not readily spring to mind. Even defining an Anglican, never mind a Leveller or a Digger, taxes the historical memory. Yet those were household words to the age when Newton lived. If you want to understand someone born in 1642, there is no escaping a brief journey into baroque metaphysics and religious sectarianism. Broaching the new social history of science requires some general history. Consolation may be found in knowing that after Newton, Darwin cannot be too far away.

Once, Westerners had a tidy picture of Newton, the rationalist. It seemed that nothing would ever destroy it, but in the 1930s new evidence about Isaac Newton, who had died two hundred years before in 1727, surfaced in the form of thousands of unpublished manuscripts. When they came up for auction in 1936 at Sotheby’s in London, many were discovered to be of a decidedly “unscientific” character. Few bidders could be found for the hundreds of theological and alchemical manuscripts in the collection. At bargain prices, they dispersed to every corner of the globe, some probably lost forever. It was only in the 1960s with the professionalization of the history of science that anyone bothered to take a serious look at Newton’s private writings. What historians found turned out to weaken further the model of science beloved by the logical positivists and their many followers. New evidence sometimes gives rise to anomalies, for both historians and scientists.

Reexamining the writings, both published and unpublished, of the titan of the Enlightenment revealed an Isaac Newton radically at odds with the secular hero. Newton can now be shown to have rejected certain philosophical positions not simply because the science they supported was wrong, but also, and perhaps primarily, because he believed that those positions would lead to atheism. Good seventeenth-century Protestant that he was, Newton rejected Descartes’s theory of matter because it led to the denial of God’s activity in the universe, and hence in Newton’s mind to atheism. The Cartesian universe worked because it was completely filled: bodies moved by constantly colliding with each other; all motion resulted from the mechanical push-pull interaction between bodies, whether large or minuscule like an ether; no spiritual agency was necessary.15

Newton’s unpublished writings, now housed in libraries from California to Israel, show him to be horrified by the religious implication of the filled Cartesian universe. To him Descartes’s universe appeared not only self-regulated but also self-perpetuating, and hence godless. Here religious conviction reinforced scientific and mathematical calculations. In direct opposition to Descartes’s busy, filled universe, Newton also saw from his mathematical model of the universe that no “pull” or “drag” on the motion of the planets seemed to exist; if there were extra matter, however ethereal, then his mathematical formulae would not work as well as they did. The Cartesian universe filled with swirling vortices implied extra matter of measurable weight apart from the planets. But how to abandon mechanical push-pull, the central achievement of the new science as formulated by Descartes, and not fall back into magical or teleological notions of motion as simply there because in the very nature of bodies?

The new socially focused scholarship on Newton saw religious values at work in his rejection of Descartes, and the new scholarship also revealed Newton’s fascination with alchemy. The question loomed large: had Newton, one of the founders of modern science, in fact reneged on the central commitment of the new science, to pursue nature through experiment and not through magical shortcuts? Did Newton sacrifice science on the altar of his religious convictions? If historians frame the questions in ways that reflect their definitions of what science must be like, refusing to suspend belief in those definitions, then even Newton fails the test.

Religiosity approached historically held the key to explaining how Newton understood nature and science. Because of his belief in the supreme power and authority of God, as expressed through spiritual agents and immaterial forces at work in the universe, Newton was able to escape the trap set by magic on one side—seen as fostering a kind of atheism because it made nature and magicians into forces independent from the deity—and on the other move beyond the prevailing science of his day, the Cartesian model. Newton postulated a universe with empty space dominated by spiritual forces: God, angels, “active principles,” even Christ. Space became, to use his metaphor, the sensorium of God wherein He established contact with His creation. In Newton’s view, the matter of the universe was dead, “brute and stupid,” moved only by immaterial forces. With this model, Newton could abandon contact action between bodies as the key to motion in the Cartesian universe. He could also devote a good portion of his working life to alchemical experiments. To him they revealed the presence of invisible forces derived from an all-powerful creator. Whether Newton was studying planets or minuscule portions of chemical substances, he sought to demonstrate definitively God’s creative force and continuing power.

Without the religious element in his life, Newton could not have articulated the law of universal gravitation. Newton’s social universe, as it worked into his science, lay just as much in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, as it did in his laboratory. Religious conviction enabled him to conceptualize universal gravitation. Divinely implanted, gravitation operates as a force in a universe composed of planets at motion in a vacuum. The physical truth of the mathematical law could finally be possible for Newton because of his religious and metaphysical convictions.

The social history of science only began with Newton’s religious and philosophical writings. In search of the context of those writings it expanded outward from chapel and laboratory to his childhood and beyond, to revolutionary England during the middle and late seventeenth century. When barely twenty in 1661, the first year of the restored monarchy and reestablished church, Newton went to Cambridge University as a scholarship student who waited on the tables of his betters. In the aftermath of the Puritan revolution, Cambridge had become an ideological minefield where students and faculty picked their way through bitter doctrinal and sectarian battles. Bent upon purifying the university, churchmen sought to root out heresy even among their own kind. More tolerant Anglicans, like Newton’s teachers, were willing to compromise with former Puritans, and as a result they were persecuted by the less tolerant; even the new science, because associated with the Puritan cause, was suspect. No single ideology or cultural stance or religious position determined the content of Newton’s science. But cultural and social forces did set limits and give permission to certain theories and not others. Influenced by the churchmen who taught him, Newton could not countenance any theory of matter that would make it alive, dynamic, and self-regulated, or the master of its motion. Such beliefs were associated with the pantheism and materialism of the radical sectaries of the revolution. Going further than even Puritans who had started the revolution, the radicals used philosophical arguments intended to level the clergy, indeed to level society. Radicals like the Levellers argued for voting rights for all males except servants, and for property redistribution. A sect known as the Diggers wanted the communal ownership of land; the Quakers let women preach publicly before congregations. The religious beliefs of the radicals focused on the sanctity of this world, and their philosophical doctrines collapsed the separate spiritual realm back into the world of everyday things. All these beliefs amounted to atheism, according to the orthodox defenders of social order and hierarchy.

Newton’s idea of the absolute, eternal truth of every aspect of his science followed from his belief in his God and his concomitant fear of atheism. With God in place, Newton knew there could be order in the universe, possibly also in society. There could also be absolute Truth which existed in a higher spiritual realm into which the world offered only occasional moments of insight. The kind of transcendent truth that Newton believed his science to possess, and that he bequeathed to the Enlightenment, started with a transference. He transferred divine authority to the laws of science. Three centuries after the first major revolution in the West it is possible to see the origins of the modern belief in the transcendence of scientific rationality in those distant seventeenth-century struggles to maintain the transcendence of the deity, to assert the supremacy of orthodox Christianity over heresy and disorder.

But Newton’s historical legacy remains relevant in another way. Research in Newton’s papers has even made standard notions of rationality problematic. His private alchemical writings reveal that like many of his scientific contemporaries, Newton was a practicing alchemist. Even then, but more so now, many people have defined alchemy as magic, and magic, so it is believed, could not be rational. Newton, however, practiced alchemy as a vital element in his religious and scientific enterprise. As he watched mercury begin to make gold swell, he wrote in his manuscripts how its appearances “fascinate me everyday.”16 He hid the experimental work in alchemy; its extent only came to light during the Sotheby’s auction back in 1936. Many of Newton’s contemporaries associated alchemists, astrologers, and magic in general with radical political movements active during the midcentury revolution. Throughout the seventeenth century the activities of alchemists were seen to be potentially subversive—imagine what it does to a currency if ordinary metals can be converted to gold—and they were also regarded as engaged in a form of deception. Alchemists were infamous for their elixirs and love potions, and when caught selling them they were routinely arrested and jailed in some countries.17

Once examined in the postwar era, Newton’s voluminous manuscripts suggest that in the privacy of his laboratory he took his alchemy as seriously as he took his physics. Indeed, Newton’s reading in the alchemical literature may have reinforced the philosophical underpinnings of the law of universal gravitation, for it depended upon being able to imagine the force of invisible actions occurring at a distance between the planets even through the vacuum within space.18 The distinction between science and magic, once believed to be so clear and universal, was foreign to Isaac Newton. The Newton revealed by modern research perceived nature both scientifically and philosophically in ways that were deeply influenced by the political and cultural world in which he lived. Newton remains a mathematical genius, and his method, as his notes demonstrate, was indeed rigorously experimental and extraordinarily wide-ranging, encompassing physics, optics, mechanics, and even alchemy. Nevertheless, just at the moment when Western travelers were berating the Chinese for their backward magical practices, the laboratory in Newton’s rooms at Trinity College was the site of a busy, methodical, and secret effort to convert base metals into gold.

Their religious and philosophical roots buried in his private papers, Newton’s laws bequeathed to the Enlightenment an understanding of nature as mathematical, ordered, and harmonious. With the assistance of some of Newton’s closest associates, the Principia was also used against the atheists, to argue that God had designed the Newtonian universe. But gradually and ironically, the immediacy of Newton’s God faded out of the Newtonian universe, and deism became the commonplace creed of many an educated person in eighteenth-century Europe. The invisible hand of the ordering deity became increasingly remote, and in the nineteenth century under the impact of Darwin’s writings it became irrelevant.

In the Newtonian universe constructed by Christian churchmen, the order ascribed to the planets, sustained by the deity, had been presumed to characterize biological and geological development as well. Belief in an ordered development of the earth and in the fixed nature of the species that inhabit it was entirely compatible with the belief that the act of creation described in the Bible had been a real moment in time. As told in Genesis, both the earth and humankind were created more or less as they have been known since recorded history began. Early in the nineteenth century, one aspect of the Newtonian vision of order and harmony came undone as evolutionary theory drastically reformulated the Western understanding of human and animal origins.

Obviously a break of such importance fascinated the new generation of social historians, who predictably focused their methods on the key figure in the transition, the great nineteenth-century British naturalist Charles Darwin. Born in 1809 into an elite family enamored of science, Darwin (another Cambridge man) knew and yet rejected the arguments for divinely engineered order and design as applied to biological species and geological formations. Developed during his student years, his fascination with living organisms led him to take a remarkable and harrowing five-year voyage halfway around the world. In the Americas and Africa he observed species never before recorded. The experience of “fine corals, the warm glowing weather, [and] the blue sky of the tropics” made him “wild with delight.”

Upon his return to England in 1836, Darwin tried to make sense out of the “the gradual birth and death of species,” the confusing evidence of his geological and biological observations. His linguistic colleagues taught him that the artifacts of nature were like the words then being so avidly investigated by philology, the new science of hermeneutics. In a passage that Darwin liked to quote, one of the leading advocates of hermeneutics explained: “Words are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the geologist—battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligible interpretation.” But how does the scientist hear amid the silence of these newly discovered artifacts?19

Darwin’s wide familiarity with economics and social theory through the writings of Adam Smith, Auguste Comte, and especially Thomas Malthus facilitated his development of an explanation for what he had seen on his voyage. A generation earlier in his Essay on Population (1798), Malthus had formulated a law of population development which stated that while the food supply increases arithmetically, as one plus one, people increase exponentially, two times two. To curtail the growth of the masses and thus to obviate the necessity for this struggle, Malthus recommended sexual abstinence, particularly for the lower orders, whom he regarded as almost a separate race. The Malthusian perspective reinforced policies toward the poor being advocated by middle-class reformers. They would make the poor work and force them to compete, rather than remain tied to the charity of their betters. Many of these same liberal reformers were also freethinkers, eager to reform science, to make it less subservient to Christian doctrine and the influence of the clergy. It too should stand on its own, not shackled by the tyranny of dogma.

As a liberal Whig with industrialists in his family, Darwin sympathized with the reforming impulse. His recent biographers describe his circle as a place where “politics, science and literature were all of a piece.”20 Reform suggested that the present was better than the past, that in effect the superior drove out the inferior. In addition, the idea that struggle was at the heart of the development of a species, the Malthusian vision of population survival of the strongest with containment of the weakest by plague and famine, set Darwin to thinking. Before him lay the evidence he collected of fossils and birds which suggested that species had replaced other species, or that in certain geographical conditions only species with certain characteristics survived.

The fossil evidence came from his years of travel, and with it uppermost in his mind Darwin sat in his London study reading among scientists as well as theorists of market society. Perhaps the constant pressure for survival experienced by variants within an animal or human population wedged them into certain niches from which they might perish or develop. Out of the variants new species would emerge. Perhaps species are not fixed after all, simply God-given. Did he not live in a society where the poor were manifestly weaker, struggling to survive? Did it not appear that the obviously superior Europeans, heady from technological and imperial pursuits, had evolved because of certain characteristics that made it seem ridiculous now in the present that they would ever again fear barbarians?21 Did it not seem that the reform movements of the 1830s signaled the evolving progress and improvement of society and government? These were questions alive in Darwin’s intellectual circle but also in the larger society.

Darwin needed the social ideas of Malthus and others, for without them he could not have formulated the explanatory and theoretical mechanism of natural selection. Randomness—the random mutations of species—could work toward their survival or extinction, and it lay at the heart of Darwin’s model. But randomness was incompatible with any belief in the divine oversight of fixed species or with a moment for special human creation. Newton’s God could not have permitted the natural world seen by Darwin. Darwin needed a different metaphysics, his slowly, even painfully, acquired and very privately held atheism and materialism. Now with access to Darwin’s diaries listen to him say, almost offhandedly to himself, “It is an argument for materialism, that cold water brings on suddenly in [the] head, a frame of mind, analogous to those feelings which may be considered as truly spiritual.” Hardly the sentiments of a Christian, or even of a theist. Almost incredulous, Darwin wondered to himself if it wasn’t “a little remarkable that the fixed laws of nature should be ‘universally’ thought to be the will of a superior being.”22 Newton would have been horrified if he had ever peered into the heart of Charles Darwin.

The social attitudes of an imperial and market-oriented society in which continuous reform seemed possible were woven through Darwin’s science. On one hand Darwin the materialist could conceptualize human equality—simply the equality of all atoms—randomly selected; the inheritance of acquired characteristics was incompatible with random selection. But Darwin the British gentleman could also effortlessly imagine that moral superiority, a characteristic so fortuitously acquired by Westerners, particularly by men, might even be inherited: “the low morality of savages…their insufficient powers of reasoning…weak power of self-command…this power has not been strengthened through long-continued, perhaps inherited habit, instruction and religion.”23 Darwin’s racial and sexual views permeated his discussion of the origin of species and especially of the descent of man. His contemporaries were shocked by the notion that human beings had evolved from the primates. Now many people are shocked by his racism.





Truth and the Consequences of Social History



Back during the War between the Internalists and the Externalists, the social history of science lay at the heart of the fray. Inspired by it, a small group of philosophers said that they could provide a “strong programme”—the phrase, complete with British spelling, became a battle cry—for showing the socially determined or constructed nature of all scientific inquiry.24 Although they caused a stir and agitated the philosophical heirs of logical positivism, the social constructionists could not explain the way in which technical problems, or new natural phenomena like viruses, set whole research agendas. They did, however, manage to start a philosophical discussion that encouraged some significant historical research.

This research suggests that something closer to social framing—a bracketing and limiting rather than a simple constructing—seems to occur in science. Social factors—like Darwin’s attitudes toward his imagined inferiors—blend into the assumptions and values that scientists bring to their research practices. The social insight illustrated by the Newton and Darwin stories does not, however, underwrite the more extreme claims of strong programmers who have never offered an adequate theory to address the complexity of circumstances and situations that produce reasonably true human knowledge. Recent philosophers of science talk about a “hard program” and—with deliberate whimsy—challenge the macho of the strong programmers. They advise admitting failure, the dead end of social constructionism and relativism, and trying a harder task, that of understanding how the social and the cognitive cohabitate and interact.25 As in the final section of this book, they suggest new understandings of how objective truth can be produced by deeply subjective people.

The social perspective on both Darwin and Newton enriches the history of Western science and renders into human scale even its greatest practitioners. But nothing in these histories denigrates the inescapable need that Darwin had for his fossils and finches or Newton for his mathematical creativity and cautious experimental rigor. It is also the case that deeply held values undergirded and even intruded into the science practiced by both Newton and Darwin. Yet much of their science was also reasonably true to nature, and remains in use. The practice of science which can be value-laden, subjective, gendered, theory-oriented, and also metaphysically informed still occasionally leads—through contention, dispute, and testing—to reasonably true statements about nature. Whether engaged in a search for knowledge about the human past as a scientist or as a historian, evidence has to be gathered, weighed, and examined. Theories have to be formulated that bear relation to the worlds around them, both natural and social. There are no blinkers in the mind filtering out the one or the other. Built into the understanding of evidence, whether it be fossils, planets, or old documents, are ideas and ideologies drawn from lived experience, identities, values, and prejudices. And not least, scientists as well as historians have metaphysical views. When Darwin formulated his theory of evolution he was an atheist and a materialist, and these religious convictions enabled him to seek purely random explanations for the origin, as well as the natural selection and fluidity, of species.26 On the question of God’s existence neither Darwin nor Newton were “objective” or value-free.

The new historical knowledge about the social framing of modern science poses an interesting philosophical problem. More precisely, the social history of science has exacerbated a philosophical problem present since the early nineteenth century. At that time scientists stopped including God as an explanatory mechanism in their thought processes about nature. Until then, most disciplined inquiry into the human or natural condition presumed that meaningfully true things could be known about objects because the metaphysical, metahistorical realm wherein Newton’s God dwelt ultimately guaranteed truth. Human beings had a chance at finding the truth, however enfeebled they might be by evil or self-absorption, because God existed and oversaw the natural and human world. In other words, the first Western scientists were able to agree that science occupied a higher platform from which to search for truth because their intense theism, their particular definition of the Judeo-Christian God, allowed them to anchor science in a divine order. They were fitting their laws to God’s creation, set by Him who would not deceive. English Protestants and American Puritans especially latched onto the Baconian injunction to study God through His word and His work.

By the nineteenth century one did not have to be an orthodox religious believer to hold a similar kind of position. Late-eighteenth-century pantheists and materialists such as Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin, who was also an atheist, made an interesting linguistic move. The elder Darwin said that Nature is God, and capitalized the word to make the point. In a stroke—or a word—even eighteenth-century atheists managed to save the truth status of the metaphysical and hence physical realm. They simply invested Nature with all the attributes of transcendence that made eighteenth-century scientific truth and the objective posture needed to search for it possible.

In the twentieth century, neither God nor Nature has been allowed as an admissible explanation for the truth in any scientific (or for that matter in any political) debate. In effect, the metaphysical platform bequeathed by the early modern theologies—even by old-fashioned pantheistic materialism—was conveniently detached from the being that permitted its erection. In the past, human beings could discover absolute Truth because God (or Nature) guaranteed it for their knowing. While politicians may piously invoke God, in practice a candidate would be run out of town for telling voters that the recession was over because God had answered his prayers of the day. Similarly, a scientist who proclaimed that God had revealed the existence of quarks would have a hard time getting published. To avoid relativism, modern men and women cannot jump back to the seventeenth century and embrace Newton’s God. He is gone forever, ironically undone by the power unleashed by Newton’s science.

The social history of science needs to be put near the top of a list of factors that hastened the demise of one of the West’s most tenacious absolutisms. But its findings have remained confined to the occasional quarrels that erupted in the philosophical literature about science, their relative obscurity matched by the fate of historical studies of Western science. Rather than becoming a mainstay in the educational experience of the citizenry, the history of science became the subject of specialized courses taken by a small minority of students. The new departments were small, and their clientele, not being required to study the history of science (or indeed by 1970 not being required to study much of anything), opted for physics for poets instead of “From Galileo to Einstein.” Likewise, in American colleges science itself attracts a smaller percentage of students than once it did.





Relativism Redux



Since the 1960s, American universities have established whole departments devoted to the history of science and technology and have awarded annually about thirty Ph.D.s in the history and philosophy of science.27 Professionalization and democratization combined with increased funding for the social history of science from the National Science Foundation contributed decisively to the triumph of the social turn taken by the discipline. Within the postwar context, all these innovations in American universities encouraged a break with the Enlightenment faith in heroic science which had prevailed since the eighteenth century. By the last quarter of the twentieth century the Enlightenment’s vision of disinterested, unfettered, value-free truth conquering superstition and ignorance, and always in the service of human progress, no longer appeared entirely relevant or even credible. Effective challenges to the neutrality of science shattered a once innocent faith. Critics saw science and technology not as enterprises in the service of humanity, but as disciplines whose content reflected the interests of government sponsors, military projects, or more generally, the needs of Western men, women having largely been excluded from the laboratories.

Influenced by this same disillusionment with the universalist claims of science, by the 1960s historians looked back at the history of Western science and found a very different story from what had been believed throughout much of this century. In the very sinews of heroic science they located concepts of masculine domination as well as biases toward women and non-Europeans.28 In the eighteenth-century colonies of the European nations, for instance, historians discovered scientists and doctors in the age of Enlightenment eager to apply their methods and treatments in the interest of extracting more and better labor from their slaves.29 Then there were the horrors of their own century. New research on German science during the Third Reich revealed an even more disturbing paradox. Once the believers in value-free science had said that all Nazi science had been pseudo-science, but historical research showed that the Nazis did indeed have their natural and social sciences which served the ideological and military needs of the regime right to its end.30 Nazi science could be both quite good in scientific terms and singularly evil in political and moral ones. Some cynical critics have even tried to argue that the second was a consequence of the first.

To the acknowledgment of Nazi science was added a new awareness about the workings of science and technology in the former Soviet Union. Suddenly at the end of the twentieth century, the rest of the world discovered its relative backwardness. As true believers in heroic science (even Marxism was supposed to be scientific) the Soviets had built the largest scientific and technological establishment in the world, and still managed to be industrially and environmentally backward.31 The conclusion becomes inescapable: the inevitable progress promised by the model of heroic science does not fit with reality. The strong programme or social constructionist approach offered relativism in response, but most historians and philosophers of science, although accepting the importance of social context and social framing, did not find that relativism could adequately account for the truths found in science. The solution that seemed to make the most sense entailed understanding the historicity of science, of scientists and scientific texts, while at the same time recognizing the interpenetration of rational and social processes.

The implications of the Internalist/Externalist War and of social constructionism have been missed or ignored by innovators in other fields of history, in hermeneutics, and especially in theory. On the face of it, the history of Soviet physics, or steam engines and turbines would not seem to have much to say to people reading Sartre, or later Foucault and the postmodernists. Yet saying, as some theorists do, that science is part of the West’s uniquely universalist and hegemonic discourse does not adequately address the knowledge it offers and represents. It may seem liberating to assert, and claim as feminism, that “the subject of technique and its technologies is the ego cogito—Man in history.”32 The argument implies that because the Cartesian prescriptions for truth-seeking were offered primarily to men, the enterprise of scientific knowing cannot have a universal meaning. The method of doubting and investigating nature in the search for usable knowledge is relative only to the seventeenth-century men for whom it was primarily intended, and late-twentieth-century women should liberate themselves from these conventions.

Relativism does not help us understand the power of some methods and the knowledge those methods are capable of producing. Sometimes gendered human beings working in laboratories, enveloped in linguistic conventions and cultural matrices of values and beliefs, can solve a problem in such a way that it need not be reopened. Put another way, although he feared atheism and irreligion and cherished a baroque metaphysics while practicing alchemy along with mechanics and optics, Newton came up with a physical and mathematical formulation—compatible with his beliefs and values—which became for him and subsequent generations in all cultures the law of universal gravitation.

Perhaps, in a curious way, the heroic model of science helped to breed contemporary relativism because its heroic conception of scientific rationality served so many masters, because it was used to undergird standards of right and wrong, along with the self-serving and imperial belief in Western and male superiority. The absolutist defenders of scientific truth thought that if heroic science did not hold up, then relativism would be the only position logically available. Ironically, the old positivists sound much like the new postmodern relativists. Both deal in absolutes; neither can imagine the complexity of a human situation in which workable truths appear as the result of messy, ideologically motivated, self-absorbed interventions undertaken by myopic people whose identities may be vastly different and distant from one’s own. Both absolutists and relativists seem uncomfortable when asked to address simultaneously the historicity and the successes of human inquiry.

As disillusionment with the scientific model of historical truth has grown among historians, an option imagined as new has attracted adherents: why not embrace the historian’s version of a strong programme and take up philosophical relativism? But if embraced, the resulting relativism fails to address adequately the search for historical truths, and the need for causal explanations and narratives. Once again relativism fails the needs of historians just as it skirts the possible existence of truths in science. Every time people go down the relativist road, the path darkens and the light recedes from the tunnel.





Truth Without the Heroes



The social history of science suggests that people create knowledge in time and space. Such truths do not permit access to the transcendent realm that Newton believed his science could reveal. This limitation constrains science, making it neither very heroic nor grand, but leaving it both rational and powerful. Indeed, unheroic truths even have their philosophical advocates. Since the early nineteenth century and the writings of the German philosopher Hegel, Westerners have been able to articulate a human situation in which truths occur in history, in which forms of knowledge are invented by human beings trapped in time, deeply influenced by the social and natural worlds around them.

Historicizing science has rendered it the work of human beings; it becomes truth-seeking and truth-finding without the possibility of transcendence. Despite what Newton, and even Hegel believed, there can be no dwelling among the gods. But Popper also got it wrong when he thought that historicity makes relativism inevitable. It is possible to have scientific revolutions influenced by both technical problems and ideologies. The one need not exclude the other, now or in the past.

Historians of science sometimes get the defenders of science very mad because they think that historical reconstruction suggests the futility of believing that science can produce a workable, practical truth. They assume that the social historians are the new relativists who would deny the possibility of articulating laws reasonably true to nature. They wrongly presume that historians embrace what can be called, somewhat ironically, an absolute, as opposed to a methodological, relativism. The method of relativism draws upon Descartes’s prescription “I imitated the skeptics who doubt only for doubting’s sake…in order to find rock or clay.”33 Skepticism, or relativism, by this method becomes a means toward the end of finding a more workable truth. In other words, to do the history of science, the historian begins with a willing suspension of belief. If you presume that Newton was simply right, it becomes harder to ask what he thought he was doing and why he did it. Historically situating any body of knowledge, including science, is how historians go about the job of discovering, describing, and explaining the past. But did not the methods of science help shape the practices of modern historians? Some might say that in the course of applying their critical methods, especially to the truth claims of science, modern historians have become an ungrateful lot.

The charge of ingratitude should not be dismissed lightly. Watching the assault mounted in this century against truth and the search for objectivity by various forms of totalitarianism, some people have concluded that putting history back into science will undermine its truth and the achievements of its practitioners. But it is not necessary for the historian to endorse that conclusion in order to see the larger issue. Given the status and achievements of modern science, its relativizing would be the ultimate goal in any project to destabilize the search for truths or the endorsement of objectivity. Because the study of history, as well as the entire enterprise of Western learning, has been tied to science since the Enlightenment, the demise of heroic science has implications for all historians. Denying the possibility of truth produces a relativism that makes it impossible to choose between ethical systems. And since the demise of Newton’s God, epistemological and moral relativisms are always a possibility; indeed, they are even once again fashionable.

But relativism need not be the only option. Just because science, like everything else, has a history does not mean the end of truth. It does mean that the nineteenth-century philosophers attributed far too much to its power, and then in the process tried to make history be like it. In the nineteenth-century sense, there is no scientific history, nor is there even scientific science. But it is possible to know some things more rather than less truly. In their respective realms, both history and science seek to do that. Given the issues about truth and relativism that have been raised late in this century, historians cannot pretend that it is business as usual. It is essential to rethink the understanding of truth and objectivity. Faced with what is known about the interaction of the social and the scientific, philosophers of science are groping their way through the thicket, and so, too, must historians and scientists.

Philosophers can offer historians some help in the debate about relativism. Most of them have moved beyond the positivist / social constructionist dichotomy. Their approach to the problem of truth-seeking is relevant to any discipline coming to terms with the social, gendered, temporal, and linguistic nature of human knowledge and with the concomitant challenge of relativism. Historically informed philosophers argue, for instance, that the social nature of scientific work is part of its essence, not simply the aftermath of too much conference-attending. In other words, the social is essential to scientific truth-seeking. “Scientific knowledge cannot be reduced to the knowledge of an individual and cannot be understood in terms of processes in principle individualistic, such as the simple additive accumulation of the individual’s knowledges.”34 Social perspectives such as these do not seek to deny the existence of truths hard won by reasoned inquiry and contestation (even if the struggle appears to be largely private, resembling Newton’s dialogue with Descartes). Rather they point toward renewed understandings of objectivity, of how reason works in complex ways. They imply that the objective does not simply reside within each individual, but rather is achieved by criticism, contention, and exchange. Without the social process of science—cumulative, contested, and hence at moments ideological—there is no science as it has come to be known since the seventeenth century. Criticism fosters objectivity and thereby enhances reasoned inquiry. Objectivity is not a stance arrived at by sheer willpower, nor is it the way most people, most of the time, make their daily inquiries. Instead it is the result of the clash of social interests, ideologies, and social conventions within the framework of object-oriented and disciplined knowledge-seeking. Encouragement to continue seeking comes from truths discovered in time, a temporal process preserved by memory and history for all time.

An argument emphasizing the social character of scientific research points directly toward the history of democratic practices and institutions in the West. The emergence of a relatively free social space for discussion and contention depended upon the creation of civil society. Still other aspects of the Enlightenment’s legacy are germane. Hermeneutics, the art of interpreting the world through its texts, applies to both scientific and historical truth-seeking. There is a hermeneutics within science. Scientists give meaning to objects; they too are bound by linguistic conventions, by discourse. Even experimental and experiential knowledge has to be expressed by languages which can embody theoretical presuppositions and social values. “Facts,” before they can be discussed, must be named.35 Such arguments should not undercut the ability to say meaningfully true things about the world. Regardless of language and human linguistic conventions, nature, whether in the form of planets or microbes, would still be real, out there and behaving in predictable ways, even if there were no way of saying so.36 Colliding with a moving object repeatedly could, however, only illicit a growl and never the law of inertia.

From this philosophical perspective the scientist’s language, or the historian’s language, becomes actively involved in the knowledge created. When Newton used the word “matter” he had to have in his mind an entity without life or will before he could have conceived of a separate dynamic, gravitational force in the universe. And the words “force” and “universe” and “God” all had to have meanings distinctive to his mind and hence to his time. This does not mean, however, that no longer believing as Newton did that matter is “brute and stupid,” twentieth-century people cannot understand or refine the law of universal gravitation. Or take Darwin. When he saw the evidence for species that had perished he could imagine random survival partly because of the harsh circumstances of survival he witnessed in the social world that nurtured him so comfortably. Neither historical insight undercuts the truth of evolutionary biology or Newtonian mechanics; both offer a historical perspective on the hermeneutics through which truths were discovered. Truths hard won by human beings, however mired in time and language, can make for consoling allies. In the darkest moments of this century they have kept many people from despair. Historicizing any moment need not, should not, sacrifice the truths people discovered in it. Indeed, historicizing entails imitating their quest, searching for other kinds of knowledge, for historical knowledge.

Precisely as a consequence of that search, the absolutist, heroic science bequeathed to the twentieth century by the true believers of previous centuries came under fire. In the postwar era, given the role played by science and technology in war-making, the very nature of science had to be dissected and reevaluated. No body of knowledge of such power, no group of men (or women) with such command of resources—some kept secret from public inspection—could be allowed to go unexamined and unchallenged. The icon of heroic science found its iconoclasts. Yet not despite but because of all that is now known about the unheroic, deeply social nature of scientific truth-seeking, science still stands at the center of the enterprise of knowing. A democratic society with roots in the Enlightenment depends upon the positioning of science, upon the affirmation it gives to the human ability to reason independently and successfully about objects outside the mind, while recognizing the social and ideological dimension of all knowledge.
