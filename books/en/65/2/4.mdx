title: 4 Competing Histories of America

DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY the absolutist state came to represent all of the ills of society. Castigated as hierarchical, intolerant, repressive, and implacably opposed to all change, the old-regime monarchies furnished most of the targets for reform literature. In contrast to these moribund institutions, Enlightenment writers imagined a free and open social world where citizens, savants, and statesmen would reason together to encourage enterprise, expand the ambit of liberty, foster learning, and promote the interests of humankind. In the United States the Enlightenment program passed quickly from theory to practice. Through most of the nineteenth century, American citizens viewed their nation as the embodiment of Enlightenment ideals as well as the template for social advances that would one day come to all peoples.

Even in Europe, where the radical reforms of the French Revolution were blunted by a powerful reactionary movement, science, technology, and industrialization marched together toward impressive material and intellectual accomplishments. Pacing this record of mastery were the ambitions of philosophers who envisioned a coordinated assault upon the mysteries of nature, society, and human behavior. The positive laws of social development revealed for their believers a future of beneficent change. The abuses of the new industrial system, like the enduring miseries left uncorrected from past times, came to be categorized as parts of an unfinished agenda, mere examples of cultural lags rather than intractable aspects of the human condition. During most of the nineteenth century, success sealed off the prophets of progress from exactly the kind of scrutiny which their predecessors had brought to bear on traditional institutions. And so the enlightened enemies of absolutism ended up by erecting a new kind of absolutism—only now it reigned in science, philosophy, and enlightened public policy. History came to play a major role in propagating this modern orthodoxy, particularly in the United States. And just because their national history was so integral to Americans’ identity, the new orthodoxy became a part of the political conflicts generated by industrialization.

The appalling destruction of the Civil War remained a vivid memory during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, the carnage itself being replicated when the Union Army moved west to wage savage campaigns against the Plains Indians. In the South the white supremacist Redeemers used selective violence and systematic terror to drive freed men and women back to a state of servile dependence once federal troops were removed with the end of Reconstruction in 1877. Lynch law became the law of the land for African-Americans, with lynchings reaching a cumulative total in the thousands in the early years of the twentieth century. Historians after the Civil War dropped a discreet veil over this discreditable record, focusing instead upon the valor of the white soldiers which had made the Emancipation Proclamation possible. Abrading the sensibilities of white Americans more than violence against Indians and blacks were the threats posed by immigration, labor unrest, and declining profits in farming, all traceable to the profound restructuring of the American economy.

American industry revealed its astounding potential for growth between 1880 and 1920. A new breed of national leaders emerged—the winners in an utterly unprecedented competition for control of entire trades like meat packing, sugar processing, and oil refining. Swiftly the myriad of locally owned enterprises disappeared into giant national firms, leaving the new institutional leviathans—the corporations and trusts—with centralized control over the economic lives of the farmers, mechanics, and shopkeepers dispersed across the continent. Increasingly the future for their children meant leaving the countryside to join the swelling population of factory workers.

What had once been islands of manufacturing enterprise became national networks drawing labor and resources to new hubs of economic activity. The private decisions of bankers and manufacturers created complex, interlocking systems of industry, commerce, and finance which pushed to the margins of national life the country’s rural communities. Maintaining the concept of an undifferentiated people—so long a resonating theme in America’s self-understanding—proved impossible. The rich were not only getting richer, their conspicuous riches advertised a new, more modern, and more menacing era. Journalists raided the lexicon of aristocratic societies and found “tycoon,” “magnate,” and “robber baron” to label America’s triumphant industrialists. Since references to feudal Europe uniformly evoked the thought of a privileged class lording it over hardworking ordinary folk, talk of the nation’s new robber barons called into question the permanence of America’s revolutionary legacy.

Evidence of material progress abounded, but opportunities for individuals to connect independently with the country’s economic expansion declined during its sudden industrial transformation. The minimalist government which had been the proud manifestation of the Jeffersonian faith in the ability of ordinary men and women to run their own affairs now appeared hopelessly outmatched by the giant corporations. The possibility that there might be material improvement concurrent with the corruption of democratic practices threatened to sever that ideological link between materialism and morality that had enabled Americans to interpret their prosperity as proof of their superior values.

Philosophy too seemed to have turned against the United States. The optimism about man’s rational capacities—and it always was man’s—which characterized attitudes at the nation’s founding had been supplanted by a tough-minded skepticism about the power of thought to affect the larger forces shaping human existence. The mechanistic depiction of the genesis of Homo sapiens in Darwin’s evolutionary theory published in The Origin of Species in 1859 had struck a blow at the Judeo-Christian foundations of the nation’s culture. By the end of the nineteenth century, Europe again was providing intellectual ammunition for an assault on the new absolutism grounded in the natural laws of progress. Only this time it would be liberalism itself that fell under the analytical gaze of scholars. Marx’s radical reinterpretation of the root causes of social action, Darwin’s subversion of Christian dogma, and Freud’s startling disclosures about infant sexuality—all of these critical investigations of human nature and society—acted like enormous boulders thrown into waters that had been calmed by Enlightenment confidence in man’s mastery of the universe.

Outside the realm occupied by philosophers, the lives of millions of men and women on both sides of the Atlantic were being wrenched out of familiar agrarian patterns by the relentless progress of economic development. By the end of the nineteenth century, Darwin’s bleak depiction of the struggle for survival imposed on all living creatures offered a grim analogy to actual social developments in the United States. Mines, foundries, sweatshops, factories, and tenement houses sprawled across the urban landscape, while suburbs were laid out to shelter the families of the well-off from the stench of progress. Industrial advance came with lightning speed to an America barely recovered from the devastating bloodbath that had pitted North against South. The bounteous nature that had been so profligate with its gifts to America’s charter settlers had yielded to Darwinian laws that explained how the scarcity of goods forced people to fend for themselves in the great scramble of life. Where, within this biological dynamic of chance and destiny, was there a place for the United States, whose national history orbited around the twin stars of liberty and equality? More to the point, how was the American legacy going to be distributed in an industrial society of dispossessed farmers and deracinated immigrants?

It is one of the great strengths of ideologies that they defy logic and hence are able to weld together incongruous, even conflicting, ideals. The American identification of national mission with the clean slate of the frontier West is a case in point. The opportunity for free men and their families to fashion their own lives was deemed generally fulfilling because of desires embedded deep in all human hearts, while the nation’s bounty of undeveloped land was accorded the specialness of a divine dispensation. The universal and particular fused. All men and women wanted the fresh start America offered. This uniform yearning lifted American history above the specificity of time and place. Still for the world, as for most of the citizens of the United States, the West was more inspirational than real. Its invitation to quit established settlements created a kind of psychic space in which men and women could fantasize about other possibilities in life while its actual awesome emptiness and exotic indigenous peoples possessed more appeal as subjects for dime novels than as future homesites and neighbors. When the superintendent of the U.S. Census announced that there was no longer a frontier line, he cut off one of the escape routes of the American imagination, and he did so at the very time that a host of other changes challenged the nation’s collective capacity to adapt to industrialization.

By 1893 when Turner offered his frontier thesis as a way of understanding the American character, the very idea of an American people had become problematic. What challenged it was the unexpected arrival of millions of uprooted Europeans. Beginning in the 1870s and swelling with each succeeding decade until the outbreak of World War I, people from Greece, Italy, Ireland, Croatia, Serbia, Germany, the Baltic states, Poland, and Russia streamed into America—fifteen million in the first fourteen years of the twentieth century alone. Many of these new arrivals were Catholics and Jews, whose alien religious practices stirred deep prejudices in the native-born white population. Bred to believe in toleration, the predominantly Protestant citizens of the United States were sorely perplexed by their own intolerant responses to the immigrants’ peculiar ways. What became quite evident was that America’s religious diversity had been pretty much confined to the Protestant strain of Christianity, and within that strain common folkways had ameliorated the friction from divurging patterns of faith and worship. Whether they were Catholic or Jewish, the conspicuous differences in the immigrants’ looks, behavior, and patterns of sociability disturbed American Protestants. They drank beer in the parks, enjoyed boxing matches, followed religious rituals in foreign tongues, and crowded into makeshift tenements. Their very cultural diversity implicitly challenged the universal validity of American norms, just as their dark coloring brought to the surface the contradictions between Americans’ ideals and their racial prejudices.

Despite the nation’s commitment to religious liberty, the preponderant descendants of the white American colonists were highly sensitive to variations from their own mores even when they were sanctioned by a religious denomination. The Mormons, for instance, were subject to persecution in the 1840s. In a largely unself-conscious way the oldest white immigrants—a group often referred to now as WASPs—had defined as universal values which, in fact, came from their Protestant background. The love of individual liberty that they extolled along with self-reliance were qualities closely identified with the Protestant side of that great divide in Christendom created by the Reformation. Thrift, disciplined effort, and the deferral of pleasure were such conspicuous traits of early modern Calvinists that the German sociologist Max Weber labeled them the Protestant work ethic. Even the “invisible hand of the market” which Adam Smith had evoked to describe the uncoerced operation of a free economy owed far more to the Protestant orientation of the British people that he observed than to any universal tendencies in human nature.

American Protestants tended to treat these personal dispositions as natural endowments rather than social characteristics. These qualities emerged particularly strongly in the United States, they argued, because it took a free environment to cultivate man’s natural tendency toward individual autonomy. Even though these personal traits have to be carefully instilled at childhood, it has only been in our own time that the cultural component of behavior—the learned behavior that requires models and mentors—has been thoroughly explored. In the nineteenth century, American history, like American intellectual life in general, pivoted around the successful male white Protestant, whose features were turned into ideals for the entire human race. When lacking, their absence indicated an unnatural deviation, except in the case of women, who were viewed as naturally deficient and hence dependent upon men.

The middle class’s unacknowledged universalizing of Protestant values became conspicuous in its public denunciations of the mores, politics, and religion of the recent arrivals. For the American WASPs whose lives spanned the turn of the twentieth century, the foreigners flooding into their cities represented a threat just because they were so un-American. The southern and Eastern European origins of the new immigration stirred fears of a mongrelization of the native stock, leading to calls for congressional restrictions on immigration. The very term “mongrelization” evoked images of a civilization-destroying animality. Darwin’s theory of evolution with its sociological corollaries gave nineteenth-century Europeans and Americans, already acutely aware of the divide of race, a scientific rationalization for counting others as inferior.

The idea of progress lent itself to these preoccupations, for if one assumed that human society was inexorably improving, then some explanation needed to be given for the relative indifference to material and social innovations among those outside Western Europe and America. Evolutionary theory, applied to entire societies in the world, provided an answer. Melding the physical with the social, scientists announced a new hierarchy of racial types which ranked human beings according to their group’s measurable advance toward progress evident in the West.

These prevailing anthropological theories invited an intense scrutiny of faces, body types, and intelligence quotients for signs of inferiority in the immigrants coming to the United States. Disposed to think in these terms, public commentators concluded that the new immigrants were not so much different as backward. Stressing as they did genetic endowments, evolutionary theories were used to add a specious scientific underpinning to the hostile passions of prejudice. A virulent new form of racism took root in the country at large, leading many to declare blacks, Indians, and the new immigrants unfit for American citizenship.

Added to these tensions was the powerful sense of national failure in the effort to “reconstruct” the Old South following the Civil War. Not only did the federal government withdraw effective protection from the millions of freed men and women in the South, but many Americans on both sides of the old Mason-Dixon line came to accept as routine the attacks on black Americans. At the same time, the vaunted independence of American farmers crumbled before the economic muscle of the trusts while the industrialists’ voracious demand for labor insistently lured Europe’s own dispossessed peasants to the United States. The sense of an organic nation, which at best had always been fragile, collapsed altogether.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, the conventional history of the American people as the heroic champions of democracy had lost much of its credibility—not because Americans had abandoned their belief in progress, but rather because conditions in the United States at the time mocked the high moral purposes embedded in that faith. Something had clearly gone wrong. The patriotic history that had originally worked to unify a disparate people had been turned into an icon of conservatism used to ward off criticism of the political institutions now firmly under the control of a wealthy elite. Fears about declining economic opportunities with the closing of the frontier mixed with anxiety about the loss of democratic virtue and the dilution of the nation’s old bloodlines. A new generation of historians, following Karl Marx’s lead, stopped talking about the whole American people, as Bancroft had done, and began discussing class. Unwilling to grasp the nettle of American race prejudices, this scholarly cohort was ready to examine the role of class conflict in the American past just as a new group of Progressive reformers emerged to take on the plutocrats whose exercise of power was making a mockery of American democracy.





Progressive Historians’ Revision of American History



Ever since the Revolution, Americans had believed in progress, but the dominant school of historians in the opening half of the twentieth century were the first to be called Progressive historians, largely because of their efforts to reform American politics. The preeminent Progressive historian, Charles Beard, laid out the agenda for a thorough revision of national history in 1913. He himself began by smashing the pedestals upon which the Founding Fathers had stood for over a century. Getting these revered nation-builders at ground level, Beard then proceeded to go through their pockets and found—to the Progressives’ delight—that they were stuffed with government bonds which everyone knew would increase in value with stronger fiscal policies should the Articles of Confederation be superseded by a new frame of government. This proved to Beard that the Constitutional Convention had brought together in Philadelphia in 1787 not an assembly of demigods, as Jefferson had called them, but self-interested politicians like those so conspicuous in his day.

Beard’s An Economic Interpretation of the U.S. Constitution demonstrated in a new and powerful way just how crucial history is to democratic nationalism. Availing himself of new social theories and unexploited archival records, he stiffened his findings with the starch of science and revolutionized the way his contemporaries thought about their Constitution. Beard revealed, as no one had before, that history could be a mighty weapon of reform. By writing colloquially about the Constitutional Convention and the mixed motives of its delegates, he penetrated the sacred penumbra that had enveloped the document and brought into historical consciousness the Constitution as a political act.

Formerly presented as the embodiment of ideals of justice going back to the Greeks, the U.S. Constitution now took its place in history texts as the achievement of a proto-capitalist elite whose aversion to sharing power with ordinary Americans was matched by their farsightedness in preparing for the industrial nation that was to come. Because American entrepreneurs had used the Constitution to block intrusive legislation designed to improve the working conditions of their employees, Beard’s critical examination of the framing of the Constitution became immediately relevant to the decisions being made by the Supreme Court. By successfully demystifying the Constitution, Beard had called into question the validity of the entire historiographical tradition surrounding the Constitution that had flourished since the Civil War.

Attacking the notion that the Constitution represented the pinnacle of the country’s revolutionary achievement, Beard separated the Constitution from the Declaration of Independence by describing it as a reactionary document calculated to blunt the genuinely democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution. Class conflict became for the Beardians the engine driving American history. Linking the self-interested actions of the Founders to the subsequent industrialization of the United States meant tying America’s origins to the course of world capitalism. Although Beard did not actually draw upon the controversial nineteenth-century writings of Marx, he nonetheless injected the Marxist categories of material interests and class conflict into the nation’s historical consciousness. Moving beyond a simple interjection of rough reality into a celebratory historical tradition, he thoroughly scrambled the central message of American ideology by redefining the people as members of a powerless majority. For the first time, the nation’s professional historian parted company with the guardians of American exceptionalism.

Finally released from the vow of silence imposed by patriotism, Beard’s followers had a field day locating interest groups in the American past. From their research came the debtors and creditors, Westerners and Easterners, farmers and merchants, manufacturers and laborers who have confronted each other in history textbooks ever since. Beard himself had a prodigious output, and with his wife, Mary Ritter Beard, he wrote a comprehensive history of the United States which exposed the power of economic forces so long cloaked by patriotic rhetoric. The Beards revised the history of the Civil War by turning it into a second American Revolution—a veritable replay of the confrontation between farmers and capitalists which had brought forth the Constitution. Construing the North as a society run by nascent industrialists, the Progressives explained the war as a triumph of the modernizing North over the resolutely traditional Southern planters. Once again, the nation’s problems were resolved through violent conflict, only now the power of propertied men had been so greatly magnified by the course of industrial development that the future of American democracy was at risk.

Working with different assumptions about the nature of historical change, the Progressives revamped the topics, the story line, and the tone of American history-writing. They believed not only that economic interests determined people’s personal loyalties but also that those interests were divisive. Hence social conflict was inevitable. Even more profoundly revisionary was the way Progressives treated the influence of ideas in historical developments. Since economic interests were not openly acknowledged—particularly in a society committed to high-toned political values like equal rights—the Progressives believed that historians needed to look beyond the surface rhetoric of politics in order to find the true motives animating people.

With this methodological assignment, scholars approached the nation’s rich political literature about justice, truth, free choice, checks and balances, women’s rights, universal suffrage, and religious tolerance as so many smoke screens behind which the real reasons for seeking and using power were negotiated. Long-term goals, concern for the good of the whole, lofty ambitions for the nation—these were dangerous abstractions in the eyes of the Progressives, created to divert naive observers from the real springs of human action. As Beard himself wrote, “Man as a political animal acting upon political as distinguished from more vital and powerful motives is the most insubstantial of all abstractions.”1

Applying these historical insights to the patriotic effusions of nineteenth-century history books proved exhilarating for a generation of early-twentieth-century scholars. The men who ran the United States could no longer count on professional historians to present their acts as contributory to American greatness. Not coincidentally, Beard’s readers drew parallels between the Founding Fathers’ efforts to check the popular will and the exercise of power by the nation’s new robber barons. The debunking élan of the Progressives roused the ire of the industrialists and financiers who had just settled into enjoying the country they had so recently bought, but rank-and-file Americans named Beard, who taught at Columbia, one of the ten most influential men in the United States. Nicholas Murray Butler, the redoubtable president of Columbia, suffered the discomfort of being the buffer between Beard and his critics, many of them university donors. Walking across Morningside Heights one day, Butler was reportedly hailed by a faculty member who called out to him, “Have you read Beard’s last book?” “I hope so,” Butler replied, “I hope so.” He had not, of course. Beard and his fellow scholars published a stream of new work. They also succeeded in making American history a fascinating subject for the sophisticated reading public.

By the 1920s the Progressives had won the battle to control the nation’s collective memory, in large part because their depiction of historical action seemed more believable to a generation weaned on the strife of industrialization. Still, by stressing the predominance of economic interests, the Progressives actually continued that part of the American historical tradition which had emphasized that progress came from material advances. For them, America’s revolutionary democrats struggled for free land and access to the nation’s abundant resources, whereas their own contemporaries fought for higher wages and better working conditions. The Progressives denied that there had always been an identity of interests among Americans, but they retained the conviction that history revealed a progressive struggle of ordinary men against the power of privilege. Hard-headed in their depiction of interest-group conflicts, the Progressives never doubted that aspirations for personal freedom and economic opportunity represented core human drives. As much an activist as a scholar, Beard along with the radical economist Thorstein Veblen and the philosopher John Dewey founded the New School for Social Research, the first American institution to open up higher education to adults who did not possess the customary qualifications.

The idea of progress had created for the United States a central place in the evolution of human society. Denied a venerable past, American historians had turned the revolutionary origins of the nation into a prologue for the future of human beings. Of necessity this kind of elevated history, written to illuminate broad philosophical trends in the unfolding destiny of the human race, lost contact with the actual people of the past. Because progress itself provided a script for why people did things, historians could be indifferent to the immediate values and plans which engaged women and men, nor was any curiosity bestowed upon those people or events off the beaten path. There was only one kind of maverick deserving attention—the individual who was ahead of his time. Even the Progressive historians who began as the unmaskers of the patriotic and celebratory histories they had inherited never moved far from the central question of American historiography: had the nation kept faith with its democratic promise and enlightened principles?





Perry Miller’s Rehabilitation of the Puritans



In the 1930s a young scholar named Perry Miller boldly set out to study colonial America independent of its later connection with the United States. Probably this century’s greatest historian, Miller chose a most unsympathetic band of colonizers, the Puritans, to carry the burden of a different message about the meaning of English settlement in the New World. Miller viewed with scorn Turner’s apotheosis of “the ruling and compulsive power of the frontier.” It failed Miller’s test of credibility, because it suggested that mindless conditions, not mindful men and women, made history. Depicting mere circumstances as the cause of social action amounted to a regression into the womb of irresponsibility, Miller said, and he pointed to Turner as the foremost victim of the American fallacy of thinking “that things rather than forms define reality.”2 This was bold stuff, introducing philosophical considerations that went against the assumptions that had controlled the writing of American history for a long time. Without raising the issue of Marxist interpretations of history directly, Miller’s insistence upon both human agency and the predominant influence of ideas in causing change pushed American historical writing decisively away from the Progressives’ essentially economic agenda.

Rejecting the idea that pecuniary interests or material forces directed social change, Miller maintained that ideas and purposes shaped the course of events. Human beings could not move without a thought in their heads, he noted, and those men and women that moved others did so with well-articulated thoughts. Their plans might involve national glory and territorial domination, or economic enterprise and mastery of nature, or the preservation of a sacred form of life, but whatever the goal, it required intellectual framing. Someone had to describe the vision, address its implications, and chart the course of actions for its attainment. Nor were ideas equal in Miller’s eyes: some had the power to propel people across an ocean; others failed to stir a whisper of response in the popular imagination. It was, in Miller’s view, the obligation of historians to search for the motives and incentives present in the historical moment. It was an abrogation of that responsibility to assume that there were universal drives like economic self-interest or political state-building that could account for the historic transformations of modern society.

Miller chose to study the Puritans because their clarity of vision revealed the human will at work fashioning institutions and imposing form upon the inert material of the physical environment. His contemporaries, having only very recently freed themselves from their “puritanical” heritage, were not exactly ready for a sympathetic reading of Puritan ideas. The popular satirist H. L. Mencken had made the Puritans the butt of American humor. A Puritan, Mencken said, was a person haunted by the fear that somewhere, somehow, someone was having a good time. The times were not propitious for Miller’s rehabilitation of the Puritans. So secular had American culture become that another wit suggested that the nation’s religious history should be taught as the passage from “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” to God in the hands of angry sinners.3 But he took all this on and transformed the sin-hating Puritans into the bold protagonists in a drama of stirring spiritual ambitions and paradoxical outcomes.

Miller adroitly conceded to the Puritans’ critics every crabbed quality they despised: his Puritan divines were dictatorial; their devoted followers obsessive salvation-mongers. Cotton Mather he described as “the most nauseous human being that ever lived.”4 However, by imaginatively participating in the Puritans’ courageous aspiration to be in the world of sin but not of it, Miller turned these decidedly un-American characters into dauntless tightrope walkers of the soul, as courageous in plumbing the depths of their own unworthiness as Turner’s pioneers had been in confronting unseen adversaries in the wilderness. Using his great gifts as a historian, Miller read between the lines of the Sunday sermons not for evidence of economic interests but rather for the passionate commitments that these intrepid pioneers of the spirit poured into their Christian devotions. He also made the Puritans’ anguish accessible to twentieth-century readers by revealing them searching for the naked truth about the fate of humankind as they scraped away the barnacles of philosophical blathering from their sacred texts.5

Whatever came from God, the Puritans observed, was perfect; whatever came from human beings was fragmented, marred, broken, compromised. Faith, they taught, sprang from the very core of personal conscience—the sense of responsibility, the feelings of guilt, and the longing for forgiveness. As one scholar expressed it: “No man [or presumably woman] if he grows to maturity, escapes these experiences. Every man, sooner or later, feels himself rightly exiled from paradise and looks for a return. Puritanism is the elaboration of this theme, and the inculcation of its stern implications: some things are better than other things and the discovery of the best is of paramount importance.”6

Approaching the Puritan settling of New England as a dramatic script, Miller was able to invest the clerical infighting over religious policies like the Half-Way Covenant with the theatrical suspense usually reserved for Napoleon’s entrance into Moscow. His Puritans were God-intoxicated dreamers of a Bible Commonwealth. They also were the ruthless destroyers of the Pequot Indians. Like modern men, they were full of angst. Like modern women, they were deeply suspicious of the unleashed virility of natural man. Miller’s Puritans were articulate opponents of most things liberal, from toleration and novel-reading to personal liberty and practical virtue. And most disruptive of American sensibilities, the Puritans were losers. They had lost to the Enlightenment’s faith in human reason; they had lost to the revolutionary generation’s infatuation with secular progress. Still, for those Americans who were struggling to comprehend the horror of the Holocaust in the years after World War II, it was reassuring to at last find ancestors who had more than a passing acquaintance with evil.

The advance of progress had provided an overarching theme for the histories written about the United States from the Revolution to the Second World War. But Miller’s story of the Puritans drew heavily upon the Judeo-Christian tradition. It told of Biblical promises, human sinfulness, divine punishment, promised redemption, and repeated failures. Placed at the true beginning of the history of the American people in the early seventeenth century, it reversed the story line of American progress completely. Hope—exalted hopes for a people covenanted with God—came first, followed by disappointments and unexpected twists of fate. From this perspective, the nation-building acts of revolution and constitution-writing looked more like compromises than climaxes. An inescapable conclusion from Miller’s account was that there was a decided lowering of goals at the founding of the United States. As critics of modernity, Miller’s Puritans made more intelligible the dissenting voices of Jonathan Edwards and Henry David Thoreau.

Students of American history now had to confront the fact that the men of the seventeenth century had not been grooming themselves to be forefathers of a democratic nation, but rather came on their own mission of restoring the unity and purity of European Christendom. This really was a liberating, if subversive, idea. So too was the recognition that though the colonial experience had little to say about progress, it was rich with other truths about living with hope and loss and guilt, about sustaining communities against the ravages of change, about defining decency, facing death, accepting failure, and enduring the success of one’s enemies.





Social Historians Transform Historical Research



Miller’s historical approach exercised its greatest influence in the decades after World War II, when American historians were working out an interpretation of their country’s past which explained why the United States had diverged so strongly from the totalitarian regimes spread by communism and fascism. In these same years, a whole new generation of social historians set out to reconstruct the details of how ordinary Americans had once lived. Interest in this new research in social history can be partly explained by the personal backgrounds of the cohort of historians who undertook the task of writing history from the bottom up. They entered higher education with the post-Sputnik expansion of the 1950s and 1960s, when the number of new Ph.D.s in history nearly quadrupled. Since many of them were the children and grandchildren of immigrants, they had a personal incentive for turning the writing of their dissertations into a movement of memory recovery. Others were black or female and similarly prompted to find ways to make the historically inarticulate speak. While the number of male Ph.D.s in history ebbed and flowed with the vicissitudes of the job market, the number of new female Ph.D.s in history steadily increased from 11 percent (29) in 1950 to 13 percent (137) in 1970 and finally to 37 percent (192) in 1989.7

Although ethnicity is harder to locate in the records, the GI Bill was clearly effective in bringing the children of working-class families into the middle-class educational mainstream.8 This was the thin end of a democratizing wedge prying open higher education in the United States. Never before had so many people in any society earned so many higher degrees. Important as their numbers were, the change of perspective these young academics brought to their disciplines has made the qualitative changes even more impressive. Suddenly graduate students with strange, unpronounceable surnames, with Brooklyn accents and different skin colors, appeared in the venerable ivy-covered buildings that epitomized elite schooling. Their parents didn’t own stock; many did not even own their own houses. Where Perry Miller had confronted the absolutism of the inexorable workings of progress by insisting upon the primacy of ideas in social action, these scholars approached the Enlightenment orthodoxy with the skepticism all outsiders feel for the ideology of the insiders.

The effect of the influx of new graduate students could be seen almost immediately in the topics of their doctoral dissertations. Between 1958 and 1978, the proportion written on subjects in social history quadrupled, overtaking political history as the principal area of graduate research.9 Like the Boston Brahmins who formed the caste of gentlemen scholars of the nineteenth century, these young researchers looked for their ancestors in the American past, but they found them in most unlikely places for historical personages—shop floors, slave quarters, drawing rooms, relocation centers, temperance meetings, barrios, sod houses, rice fields, and tent revivals. Their radically different perspective on the American past—so understandable in the light of their backgrounds—threw into sharp relief the standards of significance which earlier generations of gentleman scholars had assumed when they concentrated upon statesmen, generals, diplomats, intellectuals, and elite institutions.

Equipped with computer skills and excellent eyes, the young scholars of the 1960s began poring over long-ignored records of births, marriages, deaths, probate inventories, land titles, slave purchases, city plans, and tax assessments. From these forgotten sources, they ingeniously mapped out the patterns of life and death, marriage and mobility, opportunity and outcome in the American past. They also illuminated the lives of those men and women who had been cast into the shadows by the conventional spotlight thrown on pathbreakers and heroes. Digging away in the public archives for thirty years now, social historians have discovered tales of frustration and disappointment which cannot be easily assimilated to the monolithic story of American success.

To reconstruct the character and structure of ordinary life was not easy. There was first of all deciding what was typical, a quality that could be determined only by examining the long-run records of large numbers of people. Unlike diaries and letters, such records do not speak for themselves. They can only answer questions that have been carefully posed by expert investigators. And these kinds of questions require testable hypotheses. Did colonial Americans marry young and have many children? And if their population dynamics differed from time to time and place to place, what were the mechanisms that accounted for shifts? Did family patterns change when an agrarian way of life gave way to industrial labor? If so, what were the factors mediating between the external economy and the personal choices of farmers and servants? If workers were in demand in the New World, what factors determined which external source of labor supplied the deficiency? Or more specifically, did Virginians turn to slave labor when white immigrants ceased to come to the New World or because the decline in the mortality rate made it worthwhile to invest in the entire life of a laborer or because the growth in the number of planters buying slaves created an incentive to slavers to bring their ships to the Chesapeake? Which immigrants went to what cities? Did cities attract immigrants because they offered employment or did a pool of immigrants drawn to a particular city by ethnic ties attract manufacturers looking for cheap labor? Questions like these inspired fresh research; they also transformed into evidence the inert notations on documents buried in public record offices and private account books. And from this evidence came the stuff of new narratives about the American past.

The social sciences—particularly sociology and economics—had long been engaged in tracking patterns of behavior, so these disciplines were able to furnish historians with theories and models. With well-framed hypotheses to test, scholars could afford to lavish months, even years, calculating the relative fertility of black women in Jamaica, Barbados, and Virginia or the proportion of tenant and farmer-owned acreage in selected counties of Iowa. These new methods also enabled historians to move away from the exploits of the exceptional leader and determine instead the norms of the unexceptional plain members of society. Since their new sources of information yielded more numbers than words, researchers had to become proficient in statistics. Soon a new vocabulary made its appearance in history books with references to gini coefficients, bell curves, and guttman scaling. Long the guardians of the particular, historians now found themselves talking about the repetitious. They took on board a new lexicon filled with words like “norm,” “pattern,” “process,” “structure,” “organization,” and “system.” Quantitative researchers—familiarly referred to as “number crunchers”—brought history closer to the social sciences, much to the dismay of those who maintained that history was a literary art.

At the same time that daily newspapers were introducing contemporary Americans to demographics, scholars began studying population dynamics in the past. Historical demographers arduously reconstituted families from the scribbled entries in seventeenth-century parish registers and nineteenth-century vital records. Unlike the genealogists, however, these social historians were not seeking distinguished ancestors, but rather the most intimate details of ordinary life. It is hard now to appreciate how little was known twenty-five years ago about the fundamental facts of life and survival, life and life chances in historical America. And, as Perry Miller had already shown, a different encampment in the American past necessarily led to different truths. This was strikingly the case with those social historians who investigated the behavior of groups and reported their findings by talking about patterns and proceses deduced from averages, means, modes, and standard deviations. The importance of the systematic had finally been flushed out of America’s historical records. At last historians could see a system—or more ominously, the system—controlling access to opportunity and categorizing the worth of men and women while distributing the nation’s cultural and economic goods.

Looking at the life cycle of average Americans, social historians necessarily found out more about groups than about individuals. They even made precise the nature of that group dependency which native-born white Americans had found so threatening in the “wretched refuse” of Europe’s teeming shores. In their scholarship, the archetypal American—that autonomous pathbreaker—was replaced by the community member, deeply socialized and fervently bound to kith and kin. Once located and studied, the historical experiences of women, of children, of laborers, of ethnic neighbors, of slaves, and of Indians could become part of America’s historical consciousness. Yet scholarship alone would not accomplish this act of inclusion. New interpretations were needed, for much like the relation of bricks to blueprints, discrete pieces of research rely on design for incorporation in a structure—in this case, a structure of meaning. Accustomed to a celebratory account of the American past, many historians found it awkward to describe those lives that had been marked by struggles without success. The newly reconstructed narratives about “the other Americans” fit ill with stories of progress or analyses that began with uniform economic drives.

There was more than an armory of anticelebratory values in the new social history. There was life—Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants recoding the culture of the block as they moved through neighborhoods; pioneer women pouring the grief of separation into their prairie diaries; freed slaves miraculously reconstituting their dispersed families in the heady days after Emancipation; Polish housewives juggling their New World choices against their husbands’ opinions about women’s place. Black Americans, so long hidden under the blanket rubric of slaves, came alive when they were encountered as persistent carriers of their indigenous culture or intrepid self-liberators (a term which jars readers into seeing how the language of the masters controls perception of their workers).

It would be hard to exaggerate the dissonance between a historical account told through the doings of an individual—the American Adam, the innovative pathbreaker, the solitary dissident—and history built up with the modular units of group experience. Whether the historians’ subject was the charter families of Germantown, Pennsylvania, the enslaved Ibos of South Carolina, the Dust Bowl migrants of Oklahoma, or the political leaders of the Progressive era, the story had a different ring when the actors were approached as members of a group.





The Implication of Social History for Multiculturalism



History, like literature, speaks directly to curiosity about human experience, but it takes concrete details to open the door into an imaginative recreation of the past. Philip Greven reports that fathers in Andover, Massachusetts, prevented their sons from marrying until their late twenties by barring their access to land.10 A few statistics about wills, ages at marriage, and land conveyances and the reader could fill in the social reality of parental control and filial submission. Would the reader chafe under these constraints? Did they? What kind of satisfaction was there in being part of a lineal family, manuring the fields that generations to come would plant? The effect of this new capacity to vivify the characteristics of countless mundane lives is moral. It sparks a human connection. There is an enormous difference, for instance, between knowing that there were slave quarters and being able to gaze at a floor plan, calculating living space while imagining young children playing within or perhaps even the hulking figure of a black man aching with the pain of a flogging. What the history of ordinary life delivers is the shock of recognition—my kind is humankind.

Looked at this way, it is clear that social historians put their research on a collision course with the conventional accounts of the American past, which had relied in turn upon the inevitability of progress. They worked with different subject matter, and they brought to their topics different assumptions about human nature. The undersocialized concept of man that we identified as characteristic of earlier national histories ran headlong into the oversocialized concept of men and women which emerged from work in the social sciences. That old, familiar tale of the pioneer alone with his family on the frontier, or the Protestant alone with his God, or the rights-bearing man alone with his conscience, only made sense within a frame of reference celebrating the individual over the group.

The conviction that society got to the individual first and stamped her or him with a group identity raised a number of troubling questions about the older belief in universal human traits. Qualities that had been assumed to be natural might possibly be social in origin. The insistence of social historians that the historical experience of women be taken seriously also challenged the easy equating of universal standards with those which were merely male. Historical research on women’s lives revealed differences which threw into sharp relief just how gender-specific was the male ideal that had dominated Western letters since the Greeks. Perhaps nothing made clearer the exercise of power involved in the writing of American history during the first two centuries than the exclusive focus upon male interests and achievements.

The new histories made salient yet another unexamined assumption of traditional American historiography: the idea that human nature itself was the source of the motives for action. As long as it was believed that human beings had been endowed with universal behavioral drives, there had been no need to consider the specific meaning attached to the motivations of historical persons. But if particular societies shaped their members’ intentions through culture, then it became necessary for historians to examine the matrix of meaning behind human motives as a separate factor, because human nature could no longer be seen as supplying the invisible springs of action and desire. Here the theoretical insights of social historians converged with the idealist emphasis of intellectual historians like Miller. In addition, the richly textured scholarly work of cultural anthropologists gave social historians a theoretical framework for discussing how societies integrate values into their workaday way of life. All rejected the Enlightenment conviction that universal human struggles for liberty had supplied the motive power for historical changes which were moving expeditiously forward on the greased track of inexorable improvement. In this emphasis on the shaping force of social values, the social historians were following in the footsteps of the African-American sociologist W.E.B. DuBois, who had powerfully demonstrated in his 1903 masterpiece The Souls of Black Folk how racial hostility supplied the grist for the Southern mill of segregation.

More and more it appeared likely to historians that culture gave form and meaning to people’s lives and that only by exploring a particular group’s values could their actions be understood. It was not enough to identify a human emotion like ambition or jealousy and let it explain an action. Rather, from a cultural perspective, emotions would be structured in distinctive ways varying with time and place. If one believed, as students of culture do, that particular societies provide the channels for expressing emotions and interests, then that specificity would become the object of historical curiosity. If every baby has to be taught how to think and act like a member of her or his group, then only the reconstruction of that prescribed behavior could open up the world of motivation and meaning to the historian.

The social history research of the past twenty years has lifted from obscurity the lives of those who had been swept to the sidelines in the metahistory of progress. It has also pierced the veil of those hidden systems which regulated the flow of opportunities and rewards in the United States, demonstrating how their functioning influenced the personal outcomes of success and failure. Those disinherited from the American heritage had at last found advocates at the bar of historical justice. Because this scholarship concentrated on the past experience of undistinguished Americans—many of them long subjected to bias and harassment—it has been criticized as a thinly veiled attack on American institutions themselves, just as the social historians’ avidity for the obscure details of past lives has been decried for trivializing the grand themes of national history.

The relationship of history to American citizenship had been flushed out from its cover behind the conventional historical record of high politics. As Mary Douglas said, nations need to control national memory, because nations keep their shape by shaping their citizens’ understanding of the past. Yet in practice it is the historians who do research on the past, write the histories, and teach the nation’s youth. It is they who lock up and unlock memory. Close to one-eighth of all Americans between the ages of twelve and twenty-one right now are enrolled in a course on the history of the United States. Whether democratic leaders like it or not, historians fashion the nation’s collective self-understanding, but they do it without thinking of themselves as agents of the state. Thus, the political imperatives embedded in the uses of national histories are complicated by the dispersal of authority in a democracy. The simple sociological truism about the need to control national memory is fraught with problems for the investigators who are committed to the integrity of free inquiry.

History is a disciplined inquiry about past events, separate from what the guardians of nationalism might want its citizens to believe. Moreover, public officials and history teachers are not the only ones involved. A democratic perspective includes far more than the government’s point of view, embracing as it does all the different groups with their divergent opinions within the society. The idea that nations control the memory of their citizens pushes to the fore the question of which persons are in charge of the nation. They may be virtuous leaders, cultural elites, locally powerful minorities, pluralistic coalitions, triumphant interest groups, or the winning competitors in the latest electoral donnybrook. Whichever they are, they are manifestly not the whole people. So to speak of the nation as an institution working assiduously to forget experiences incompatible with its righteous self-image is to fudge the issue of whose experiences must be forgotten and for which group’s benefit. A democratic nation—particularly one with as many different ethnic groups as the United States—embraces a citizenry much fuller than its official representation.

Conflicts of interest abound here. National leaders try to control the collective memory in order to forge a civic identity, while other groups in society recount particular stories to build solidarity, often in defiance of those seeking a shared past. Differently situated still, historians—when they are true to the ideals of truth-seeking and objectivity—seek to expand and complicate the collective memory beyond the utilitarian limits of consensus-building. In doing this they may well turn up information that undermines a nation’s self-congratulatory image or challenges a group’s cherished beliefs about its past. It is also the case that historians can take on the role of social critic, eschewing the cold facade of scientific fact and pointing their research toward moral lessons. These clashes make the writing of the history of one’s own country different from other historical work, for with it, a relatively open-ended scholarly inquiry collides with the vigilant censor of national self-interest and the group pressure of celebratory self-fashioning. And when this happens, historians are made acutely aware that they are also citizens who believe that what their country represents is integrally connected to what one thinks the country has done in the past.

From the historical review in these first four chapters it should be clear that the ideals embodied in the Declaration of Independence came to reflect the highest aspirations of an ascendant West as it moved to conquer both the world of nature and those people classified as “backward.” Its affirmations resonated with eighteenth-century Americans, providing them with an ennobling identity as a nation. Over time, these principles precipitated divisive issues about how best to live up to the national goals, as the slaughter of the Civil War so agonizingly demonstrated. Then and today, America stands for a set of abstractions pointing to the superiority of individual freedom, restrained government, open opportunity, mutual tolerance, and diplomatic support for free nations. Honestly embraced, these ideals raise expectations that bear on citizens and officials alike; demoted to patriotic bombast, they threaten the cohesion of the nation and its connection to the cause of democracy worldwide. Having chosen to knit themselves together as a people with the propositions of liberal democracy, Americans initially turned their history into a record of national cohesion.

The ferocity of the current argument about how United States history should be taught reveals the important fact that the stories recounted about the past have power. Indeed, the rendering of the American past—told and retold in textbooks, sermons, and campaign literature—has played a major role in the course of the events themselves. This grand narrative, worked out in scholarly and popular writings, powerfully influenced the invisible process that mobilized resources and distributed rewards. The values it propagated determined the character of American ambition and established the magnetic poles of virtue and vice, attention and indifference, success and failure. From the Revolution to the early twentieth century, this history came from a small, well-established subset of the nation’s population, and it invariably flattered the members of this elite. In these histories, their social preferences have been embedded in stories of the nation’s achievements, leaving children with a set of values that were male in gender, white in color, and Protestant in cultural orientation. They used the striking prosperity of the United States, in comparison to the poverty of other countries, as incontestable evidence of the superiority of capitalism with its legal deference to private ownership and its moral aversion to social planning. Opposition to these inferences, particularly the conflation of democracy and free enterprise, has animated dissenting historians since the beginning of this century.

Eighty years ago, Charles Beard and the Progressives attacked the veneration of the Constitution by pointing out the pecuniary interests of the Founding Fathers and the perdurability of interest-group conflict. Believing that the patriotic view of the nation’s founding acted as a bar to contemporary reforms, they used historical scholarship to strip away sentimentality and revive curiosity about more authentic human motives. Social historians during the past three decades have concentrated upon the experience of America’s outsiders—the poor, the persecuted, and the foreign. Their scholarship has revealed the fragility of community in an economic order which promotes competition for jobs and money and exposes working-class families to the inevitable ups and downs of the business cycle. The structural punishments of capitalism, they argue, have been denied through a presentation of reality which ascribes poverty to character flaws and bad luck. To tell the story of striking miners, Southern sharecroppers, or factory-working mothers, as they have, does more than give voice to the previously inaudible, it exposes the costs of capitalism.

Because social historians have set out to explore the linkages between conventional national history and the maintenance of the status quo, they have aroused the ire of patriots who claim that today’s university faculty is filled with the middle-aged and tenured radicals whose political values were forged in the caldron of the fiery sixties. Offensive to them also has been the cultural wedge driven between contemporary Americans and their illustrious forebears. The documented differences between the worldview of America’s revolutionary generation and that of the present generation have made it difficult to believe that the Founding Fathers existed to bring forth the American nation of the twentieth century. Like ourselves, eighteenth-century men and women now appear to have responded to contingent events as they moved into an unknown future. Reattaching the Founding Fathers to their own time has simultaneously detached them from the grand narrative of progress, making it all the harder to believe in a national destiny in which the United States carried the torch for all mankind.

Like John Donne, critics of the new social history have lamented, “’Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone.”11 And indeed, it seems as though the new scholarship about ordinary people has produced more history than the nation can digest. This research that has continued unabated since the 1960s has fundamentally altered the relationship between history and democratic nationalism. There has been an avalanche of information—much of it unassimilable into any account written to celebrate the nation’s accomplishments. This raises very forcefully the disturbing possibility that the study of history does not strengthen an attachment to one’s country. Indeed, the reverse might be true, i.e., that open-ended investigation of the nation’s past could weaken the ties of citizenship by raising critical issues about the distribution of power and respect.

Ruminating on the hardship and heartbreak of human life, a youthful Richard Niebuhr wondered how the Puritan message could ever have been portrayed as having been defeated—it had been ignored, maybe, but what, he asked, could ever render irrelevant the Puritans’ convictions about “the precariousness of life’s poise, or of the utter insecurity of human society, just as ready to plunge into the abyss of disintegration, barbarism, and the war of all against all as to advance towards harmony and integration.” Here Niebuhr anticipates why late-twentieth-century Americans have responded to the sermons of Puritan divines while recoiling from the simplistic oratory of a Daniel Webster whose speeches schoolchildren once committed to memory. Miller’s recovery of the stern Puritan message and social historians’ discovery of the pain and hardship of not being in the charmed circle of success have struck resonating chords with a generation of Americans concerned about nuclear war, the population explosion, the decline of family stability, the AIDS epidemic, the rise of drug dependence, the disappearance of endangered species, and the depletion of the ozone layer.

Almost two centuries ago, historians began looking to the past for the laws of social development. Confidence in this enterprise has now yielded to a profounder skepticism that questions whether such laws exist. Indeterminacy about human processes seems more believable today than the determinacy of inexorable processes. Human agency, contingency, roads not taken—once the inspiration of novelists and poets—have returned to intrigue the historian. Uncoupled from the quest for general social knowledge, history has found itself linked to a new set of public issues—those connected with the dawning appreciation of America’s multifaceted past and its multicultural heritage.
