title: 1 The Heroic Model of Science
---







IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY a small group of determined reformers established science as the new foundation for truth, a granite-like platform upon which all knowledge could rest. The absolute character of their truth mimicked the older Christian truth upon which Westerners since late Roman times had come to rely. They transferred a habit of mind associated with religiosity—the conviction that transcendent and absolute truth could be known—to the new mechanical understanding of the natural world. Eventually they grafted this conviction onto all other inquiries. The study of history became the search for the laws of human development. Understanding the challenge to truth in an age in full revolt against inherited certainties means going back in time to discover how and when science became an absolute model for all knowledge in the West.

Pure, elegant, simple, and clear when summarized by its laws, natural science with its experimental method came in the eighteenth century to be seen as the measure of all human truth. Imitate mechanical science, follow its methods, seek laws for everything from human biology to the art of governing—that was the advice bequeathed to the Western world by the Enlightenment. We call this model of science heroic, because it made scientific geniuses into cultural heroes. Until quite recently, heroic science reigned supreme. The heroic model equated science with reason: disinterested, impartial, and, if followed closely, a guarantee of progress in this world. Science took its character from nature itself, which was presumed to be composed solely of matter in motion and hence to be “neutral.” In the words of a true believer, a sociologist of the 1940s, “The stars have no sentiments, the atoms no anxieties which have to be taken into account. Observation is objective with little effort on the part of the scientist to make it so.”1 Now it is possible to put heroic science in a historical context and assess the way it has molded Western thinking. Its hubris, its accomplishments, its absolutist claims are all part of our story.

The neutral, value-free, objective image of science inherited from the Enlightenment had wide influence in every discipline until well into the postwar era. Right up until then, the rationality presumed to be the sole force at work within science acted as the magnetic needle guiding other forms of modern knowledge, including historical knowledge. It also anchored the truth ascribed to Western political and economic systems. As one recent believer in the model puts it, “At the heart of modernity is the trust or faith in scientific reason, understood as the source not only of vast powers but of authoritative guidance as to how to use those powers.”2 Faith in the guidance as well as the power provided by heroic science consoles traditionalist critics who dogmatically assert not only the truth but also the superiority of Western values.

Contemporary disillusionment frames our examination of heroic science. Compromised by two world wars and a long Cold War in which science and technology played critically important roles, the heroic model of science looks deeply flawed today, no longer workable as the foundation of all truth-seeking in this or any other culture. Science has lost its innocence. Rather than being perceived as value-free, it is seen as encoded with values, a transmitter of culture as well as physical laws. Even the truth still found in science seems different in character—more provisional, less absolute—than it did to the enlightened eighteenth-century forebears who first gloried in it. True to their age, late-twentieth-century historians of Western science have become skeptical in ways that the true believers of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and beyond would have found unimaginable, as well as irreverent. In this skeptical and iconoclastic vein, they examine the history of Western science in order to discover how Western culture acquired its distinctively absolutist image of science.

The philosophes of the eighteenth century, aided by political reformers and industrialists, invented the heroic model of science. They led an international movement for reform described as enlightened, and science functioned as the most powerful weapon in their arsenal against traditional institutions of church and state. With a bias against religious authority, the philosophes looked back at the discoveries of the previous hundred years and marveled at the trials through which science had been forced to pass. As they angrily surveyed the constraints set by the religious and political authorities, they concluded that only genius, uninhibited by superstition and prejudice, could account for the wondrous discoveries that began with Copernicus and ended with Newton. The laws of science seemed so absolutely true and so different from the medieval view of nature that only the godlike rationality of the seventeenth-century architects of the new heliocentric and mechanical science could explain the West’s liberation from ignorance. As eighteenth-century polemicists triumphed in the cultural war against the clergy and churches, their secular vision amplified the heroic stature awarded to the great scientists. Ideas of progress and methods of reasoning became viable alternatives to the older intellectual absolutisms inherited from the Christianization of the West.

Newton’s Principia consolidated and made accessible the new scientific understanding of nature as mathematical and mechanical. As a separate, autonomous, and supposedly value-free realm of knowledge, Newton’s science, the philosophes claimed, could be attributed solely to the progressive insights of earlier geniuses: Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Boyle. To borrow a phrase made famous by Isaac Newton, each scientist in his turn saw further because he was standing on the shoulders of giants. Even so, the creation and survival of the new mechanical science had seemed a difficult and precarious process. According to the enlightened commentators, the seventeenth-century giants of science, on whose shoulders the philosophes themselves stood, penetrated a fog spread by centuries of ignorance. They battled with clergy and churches and at moments risked martyrdom. From the accounts of censorship and arrests in the lives of scientists, it seemed clear that the new natural knowledge fought its way through a battlefield strewn with the corpses of theologians, philosophers, censors, and metaphysicians, not to mention magicians, astrologers, and alchemists.

One of the earliest histories of science survives from the 1750s in a set of scientific lectures given to aristocratic gentlemen and ladies in The Hague. It told the story of science from Copernicus onward, as one of genius following upon genius, and the tale unwound while the lecturer taught the fundamentals of the new science: heliocentricity, Boyle’s law of gases, Newton’s law of universal gravitation.3 The truth of the laws only seemed to confirm the truth of the history. The lecturer also explained how the universe was an ordered and harmonious place to be mastered by science, to be improved by simple machines and mathematical rigor applied to earthly as well as celestial phenomena. This eighteenth-century history of science did not differ substantially from what was taught right up to the 1950s.

For the philosophes of the Enlightenment the victory of science had been revolutionary. It meant the victory of reason over superstition, or as they put it, of light against the powers of darkness. “Let Newton be and all was light,” said Alexander Pope. Predictably, given the force of Christian imagery in the West, science also had its prophets, saints, and martyrs who preached not dogma for new heavens but the method for inventing a new earth.





The Origins of Scientific Neutrality



Coming out of the Scientific Revolution, the heroic model of science solidified in the early eighteenth century under the impact of Newton’s Principia. Using geometrical demonstrations, Newton established that the laws of motion and inertia which work on bodies here in this world also apply to the heavens. With a simple mathematical equation, it became possible to predict the rotation of the planets at any given moment. Postulating universal gravitation as a force acting at a distance and using crude but serviceable measurements of the earth’s diameter, Newton was able to offer a single, elegant explanation for the positioning of the planets, the sun, and the earth. Building upon the mechanical laws of local motion bequeathed by Galileo and using a method of analysis and synthesis that proceeded from experiment and mathematical demonstration to generalization and then back again to systematic investigation, Newton moved from the laws of local motion illustrated experimentally to celestial phenomena explicated mathematically. He offered in one book more replicable laws about physical nature than had ever been assembled in any work in the history of human thought. Contemporaries and subsequent generations saw the publication of the Principia in 1687 as the single most important event in the early modern history of printing.

Earlier seventeenth-century scientists and philosophers had laid the groundwork for the Principia. Scientists such as Galileo, who had approached nature as a mechanism, as bodies moved only because impelled or repelled by other bodies, prefigured Newton’s ideas. Galileo and his contemporaries experimented with everything from wooden balls to the movement of water in relation to its weight, and they discovered, for example, that a body in free fall accelerates in such a way that the distance it travels is proportional to the square of the time taken to travel. Imagine a vacuum, Galileo said, drop within it bodies of various weights, and all of them would increase by the same speed and left to their own, meeting no resistance, would fall unimpeded forever. Rather than imagining a universe at rest unless put in motion by the Prime Mover, the God of scholastic theologians, Galileo’s experiments permitted those who could follow his logic to imagine nature as a self-regulating mechanism.

The most farsighted of the men who came to be seen as giants with broad shoulders were the seventeenth-century prophets of science who provided a vision of what science could mean both for habits of thought and for the material order. A full century and a half before the Industrial Revolution, Galileo’s contemporaries and admirers, Francis Bacon and René Descartes, appealed for practical, ordinary men to take up the new science. Bacon and Descartes fashioned new values for an age they could only dimly imagine. They exhorted their contemporaries to leave theology to the clergy and war-making to the aristocracy and embrace a new form of disciplined learning. Bacon urged thoughtful men to go out into nature not to hunt but to observe. Baconian empiricism tied the experience of nature to the search for applications, and in its emphasis on utility, Baconianism was farsightedly industrial. Bacon even invented a utopian kingdom of science, the lost island of Atlantis, where science would solve all the problems of everyday life: disease would be conquered, food plentiful, and lives unimaginably long.

Unlike Bacon, the French philosopher Descartes allowed himself few explicitly utopian moments. While as a good English Protestant Bacon could live his life at home, in the 1630s Descartes stayed out of France and found freedom abroad. In the safe haven of the Dutch city Leiden, he published his Discourse on Method as an alternative to the medieval philosophies taught by the clergy who controlled the French universities. Illustrated on its title page by a peasant digging his field, it insisted in clear and simple language that every movement or change in nature had to be explained mechanically, that is, by the pulling and pushing of bodies against one another. No spirits or magical agents, no inherent tendencies, belonged in a philosophy of nature that encompassed everything from the movement of the planets to the action of the nerve endings in the human hand. In the Cartesian universe, pain results not from an affliction of the soul, but from impulses traveling to the brain. In the place of speculations by medieval philosophers and theologians, Descartes proclaimed that “a practical philosophy can be found by which…we thereby make ourselves, as it were, masters and possessors of nature.”4

Safe from the Inquisition that in 1633 had condemned Galileo, Descartes lived and wrote in the Dutch and largely Protestant cities because, as he explained, in them men got on with their business and left others to their speculations. He even thought that the old medieval cities of France were ugly and he adored the geometrical neatness he found in the Dutch commercial towns. He preferred cities built by a single architect, as he put it. Without fully realizing the implications of their message about individualism, commerce, and applied science, both Bacon and Descartes helped tie the success of science to a commercial and eventually industrial capitalist order. The linkage was reinforced throughout the economically expansive eighteenth century when new manufacturing technologies seemed only to confirm the wisdom of seeing the universe as an interlocking series of pushing and pulling mechanisms.

From the time of Descartes onward, the practice of the new science was remote from the luxurious life at the courts of Europe, as well as unrelated to the religious practices of the Christian churches. Science pointed away from the medieval, away from rote learning controlled by clerical schoolmen in the service of bishops and nobles, and away from a leisured culture devoted more to the hunt than to the collection of natural artifacts. Not surprisingly, science fared better in Protestant and northern countries than in Catholic and southern Europe. Despite their differences, scientists and Protestants shared a common Roman enemy. Descartes’s life illustrates that it helped to have Protestant censors who were less efficient and internationally organized than those employed by the Inquisition. Descartes got into bitter quarrels with Calvinist clergy in the Dutch Republic, but unlike Galileo, he was not threatened with arrest.

When the Principia first appeared, it seems that only about a dozen Europeans could get through the mathematical language in that dense Latin tome. Even the political philosopher John Locke, Newton’s contemporary and a trained physician, could not master the proofs without assistance. But when the first twelve or so mathematically gifted readers picked up Newton’s Principia and struggled to its final chapter, the Baconian vision had prepared them for what they found there. These early Newtonians quickly took their discoveries to a wider audience. With the assistance of journals, handbooks, demonstration lectures, and even sermons, the Newtonian message spread throughout literate Europe and the American colonies. A generation later, its contents had been opened up to anyone who could afford to attend a scientific lecture. Quite ordinary men, and even an aristocratic woman, Madame du Châtelet, became teachers of mechanics.

As proclaimed by Bacon and Descartes, and later fulfilled by Newton’s laws, science seemed to be not only neutral and universal, but also solely the work of genius. This focus meant, however, that other key elements in the origins of modern science were obliterated. In fact, science depended upon the relatively open communication of ideas and countless experimental demonstrations done before select members of the new scientific societies. The institutionalization of science through learned societies and pulpit oratory created an essential context for its survival. Even Newton relied upon a network of communication that crisscrossed London, Oxford, and his own university at Cambridge. Some of his earliest followers were English clergymen who from their pulpits used the new science to support order and stability in church and state.

Through all of these efforts, Newtonian science became a key element in both the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. By the late eighteenth century, both transformed the mental and more slowly the material universe of western Europe, which in turn made the progressive, heroic model of science seem infallible to successive generations. Through science, educated elites acquired a skeptical stance toward theology and revealed religion, which in turn easily encouraged hostility toward entrenched, unresponsive institutions in both church and state. As we will argue, the new, reforming mentality inspired a cultural war with orthodox Christianity that began in Western Europe and continued right up to the French Revolution.

The importance of science in Western modernity can be traced to far more than the anticlerical polemics of Voltaire and his friends. Newtonian science, as embodied in applied mechanics, became the essential intellectual ingredient, the mental capital, of the Industrial Revolution. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century in Britain the same people who thought of themselves as enlightened, as teachers and appliers of Newtonian mechanics, were often the profit-seeking promoters of steam engines, canal companies, or factory-style manufacturing. In the pursuit of their interests they had spread the message of applied science more deeply and widely in Britain than in any other Western country.

The reputation of science was vastly enhanced when it was credited with the most fundamental social transformation ever wrought in human history: the mechanization of human labor through the application of power technology to manufacturing and transportation. The first industrial entrepreneurs believed that if properly applied, science would enhance material wealth, and for them science generally meant applied mechanics. When they installed a steam engine, or devised a machine for spinning cotton, or brought in an engineer to improve the available supply of water power, they acted as true Baconians using the sophisticated mechanical knowledge available to their age to produce unprecedented progress. The veneer of science overlay the ruthless pursuit of advantage.

Once it was rendered simpler and its laws were memorized, the Principia made the universe accessible and its interrelated principles of weight and motion became applicable to the movement of everyday heavy objects. When new levers and pulleys lifted, or steam engines pumped, or canal waters were raised to greater heights, the same principles operated because Newtonianism explicated simple mechanical operations while relating them to the movements of the planets. The new science from Copernicus through to Galileo and Boyle had been tied into a package of mechanical laws, which could be grasped as the science of mechanics by engineers, merchants, entrepreneurs, and country gentry. For those who possessed them, science and education became the twin engines of progress. Late in the century Thomas Jefferson expressed his faith in the link between science and progress by ordering a composite portrait of the life-sized busts of Bacon, Locke, and Newton.5 Miniature planetary systems with movable globes circling the sun in elliptical orbits, made by skilled workers in copper and wood, adorned the elegant homes of entrepreneurs and merchants as well as aristocrats.

In England by the middle of the eighteenth century the civil engineer emerged as the harbinger of innovation, the slayer of tradition and the status quo. Late in the century a traveler to the coal-rich hills of Derbyshire or to the workshops of Birmingham could marvel at the enclaves of mechanization, at the longer canals, deeper mines, and stronger engines made possible by applied mechanics. Few wrote at length about the consequences for the laboring classes. The eighteenth-century British civil engineers became the new priests, and the salvation they offered was dramatically visible. When James Watt perfected the steam engine, he could congratulate himself as an experimenter and a theorist, 6 fulfilling the promise made by Bacon and Descartes.

Like Josiah Wedgwood (of porcelain fame), Watt and his Birmingham entrepreneurial friends believed in the power of machines the way pilgrims had once believed in relics. They found it hard to believe that anyone would resist their progress. British engineers spread the new techniques from Bohemia to western Pennsylvania. When French spies came to investigate English workshops they marveled at the machinery, but also at the division of labor imposed among workers that left only the mechanizer and industrialist with full knowledge of the entire manufacturing process. The rationalizing encouraged by science brought many new forms of power. In the course of the eighteenth century, science made its way from the giants to the capitalists and the appliers; its universality was further guaranteed by its accessibility to lesser, if diligent, mortals. Heroic science fostered the age of machines.

From the eighteenth century onward, Westerners would also judge other cultures by their science and technology. By the 1740s, European travelers concluded that the absence of Western techniques and mechanical thinking signaled cultural inferiority.7 The belief in science’s ability to dominate and subjugate nature was also invariably expressed in gendered language. Science became a truly masculine activity; nature (although not the atoms that composed it) was described by feminine metaphors, and she could be tamed and dominated. Excluded from scientific societies, their needs ignored in the agendas of mainstream scientific research, Western women like the laboring classes in general joined much of the rest of the world on the periphery of modern science.8 Yet as Westerners women and workers eventually shared in the actual economic improvement as well as the intellectual transformation derived from science and technology.

The power attributed to Newtonian mechanics is not a gloss that subsequent generations put on the Industrial Revolution. The link between science and industry had been made by contemporaries. At the moment when all the elites of Europe looked with wonder at British manufacturing, a French minister in charge of trying to catch up put the challenge succinctly: British power lies in “mechanics. In that secret resides its industrial power.” In a confidential report, Napoleon’s envious and worried minister said that the absolute necessity to transform and mechanize industry had already been resolved by England in a most decisive manner. The lever of its industry lay in applied mechanics, and “the overwhelming gravitation of the mass [of England’s production] makes everything conform to its orbit.”9 The Newtonian metaphor could not have been more appropriate. Back in the 1620s and 1630s, Bacon and Descartes promised the wonders of science applied; British engineers and mechanists of the eighteenth century made good on the promise, at least for themselves.

From this distance the progress of science and technology after the death of Isaac Newton in 1727 seems neither accidental nor the work of a few great minds working in isolation from their environment. Even giants, never mind their imitators, have a social context. The greater freedom of printing and the relative absence of clerical authority in northern and Protestant Europe meant that by the middle of the eighteenth century, southern Europe fell comparatively into scientific and technological stagnation. The French schools and colleges, especially the ones controlled by the Jesuits, resisted teaching Newtonian science until the 1750s. As one historian has put it, “If Newton finally triumphed in France it was probably over the corpse of the Jesuit order.”10 Given the repressive circumstances found throughout much of eighteenth-century Europe, it is easy to understand why science gradually became a symbol of unfettered truth. During and after the democratic revolutions in Western Europe, their initiators and supporters would cite the progress of British industry and the backwardness of Catholic and southern Europe to argue for the freedom of market and press and for educational reform that included the teaching of science at every level.

The new science with its experimental method depended upon open inquiry among communities of scientists free from clerical control and tied into international networks of communication. In the West, science became one of the major beneficiaries of what contemporaries described as the new Republic of Letters. Republics in the Western imagination stood for freedom and citizen participation, harking back to the glory of Rome before its imperial decadence. To summon the idealism associated with freedom and independence, the enlightened opponents of censors invented a literary republic of the mind, a semi-clandestine international zone of universally accessible intellectual neutrality. In this imaginary public sphere of the literate, science would reside, regardless of how much the censors wanted to control it. The invisible republic worked, and Western science flourished in the nascent civil society of the voluntary societies, academies, reading clubs, and coffee houses that emerged in the European and colonial cities of the eighteenth century. You could find out more about Newtonian science in a London coffee house that sponsored weekly demonstrations and lectures than you could in most French colleges before 1750.

In the experimental method of the new science developed during the Scientific Revolution—and in its fundamentals practiced to this day—true knowledge about nature occurs only after careful and replicable investigations performed by a distinctive method of experimentation that requires both evidence and theories that seek to find patterns, or what are called laws, at work in nature. Most important, the method must proceed and be recorded in such a way that any experimenter can repeat the procedure and in the process validate or refute its findings. But in the original, heroic version of why science works, the method also gave a new and distinctive identity to the researcher. He must become like Newton was imagined to have been: a giant of reason who peers at nature with eyes that are value-free, neutral, and objective. Newton’s famous dictum that he did not “feign” hypotheses came in the course of the eighteenth century to symbolize the belief that science had carved out a space within the human mind where an unprecedented neutrality reigned unchallenged.

In consequence of the heroic understanding of scientific method, the study of nature should be, as it was believed to be with Newton, motivated and guided solely by the search for truth, which, as it turned out, came to consist only in what could be proclaimed as general laws, universally applicable. Once embracing this posture, the researcher sought above all to be objective, and in this model objectivity was equated with neutrality. The value-free knowledge that he discovered (from the seventeenth century until quite recently, the literature of science generally assumed that its doers and readers would be men), if verified repeatedly by other experimenters, would correspond to what is really in nature.

The heroic model of science presumed a tight, and relatively uncomplicated, fit between nature and human knowledge of it. After all, the law of universal gravitation works in every language and every cultural setting. Bodies in free fall accelerate in measurable units proportional to the time they have traveled. The logic of heroic science anchored itself on Newton’s achievement and capitalized upon its truth. Absolute truth all of the time rather than lesser falsity, or provisional truths, became the nature of science. Realism, the belief that things can be known in ways that correspond with their actual objective existence, acquired an extraordinarily bold justification. Scientific knowledge got credited with a degree of verisimilitude only possible if mirrors resided within the heads of the scientists. The mind was imagined to be a blank slate upon which sense impressions wove their messages. The clear scientific eye became transparent as it faced nature, made so by the method and rigor only experiment and mathematics could impart to its gaze. As the mirror image of nature—itself now rendered into value-free matter possessing only weight and measure—heroic science was eternally true. Not just true in certain controlled circumstances, nor true enough for the time being, but true always and absolutely.

Properly and openly pursued, heroic science offered transcendence, the reward given to those especially smart people whose rationality rendered them transparent toward nature. The laws of science enabled rational human beings to escape time and hence history, or even to imagine that they could end history, by mirroring nature in their minds and finding a body of knowledge that survived from epoch to epoch and remained true despite repression, censorship, brutality, war, plague, and famine. In this account the intellectual self-confidence of the scientist was matched only by his heroism, a selfless courage to stand up against censors and ideologues. The rationality of science derived from the disinterested posture of its practitioners, their openness to all criticism (if based upon experimentation), and from their refusal to countenance belief, opinion, self-interest, or passion in the search for truth about nature. Eventually the rhetoric of heroic science made science so collective an enterprise, so much the result of selfless international discussion, that the person of the scientist, his allegiances, prejudices, and interests, bore no relation to what could be attributed solely to abstract science.

Sometime in the late 1940s after the Manhattan Project, haunted by the fear of nuclear power, Westerners in large numbers began to see the need to understand the values and motives of the scientists who ushered in the nuclear age. In effect they rediscovered the scientist as an agent, rather than simply a servant, of historical change. Those who now held such power had to be probed, their backgrounds and values questioned. For the first time it became necessary to get away from the eighteenth-century portrait of the scientist as a selfless participant in the new Republic of Letters. Ironically, the heroic image of science had obliterated the human agency at work in any scientific enterprise.11 It came as something of a shock to discover the scientist as partisan and policymaker, caught between the ideals of scientific openness and progress and the military necessity of mass destruction. Nothing in the previous history of science, as it had been told from the Enlightenment onward, had prepared Westerners for science in the context of nuclear power and the Cold War.





Science Becomes the Guarantor of Progress and Power



During the Enlightenment, elite Westerners constructed first an image of nature, then an industrial reality, directly expressive of the power of Western science. Like early industrialization, the scientific image of nature emerged first in Britain; eventually it would become distinctively Western. So impressive was Newton’s science that liberal clergymen in England actually used the Newtonian universe to illustrate the order and design imposed by the providential hand of the Deity, imitated by the institutions of church and state. Theirs was a new, cerebral religiosity they liked to call rational religion. It had very little in common with a miraculous version of Christianity, with relics or miracles, or with expectations of an imminent millennium. It replaced the fear and anxiety that nature once evoked with hope inspired by an ordered, harmonious, knowable world. The English garden of the period spoke volumes: gone were the clipped hedges and geometrical pathways imitative of Versailles. In their place came thickets, artificial lakes and streams amid carefully manicured forests. Now confident of nature tamed, the English gentry could invent the illusion of wildness. A similar religiosity permitted Thomas Jefferson to write his own version of the New Testament shorn of what he believed were its contradictions. So sure was he that he could distinguish the words of Jesus from Gospel chroniclers—“they stood out like diamonds in a dunghill”—that he took scissors to the sacred text.12

The new religiosity and sensibility that imagined nature as free and yet ordered had a political analogue in the eighteenth-century English and American systems of constitutional and parliamentary government. The Newtonian universe acted as an imaginary backdrop on which to project prescriptions for order, stability, harmony, and freedom. Running as it were on its own mathematically knowable forces, the universe of the Principia became a model for balanced governments and self-regulated economies, for elections, constitutions, and free markets. The imitation of these British and American forms in other parts of Western Europe after the French Revolution only further validated the cosmic imagery. The democratic revolutions late in the century enhanced the myth of heroic science.

The myth and the imagery of self-regulation did conform to a certain historical reality. Constitutional governments could be distinguished from political systems run by absolute monarchs and court-appointed bureaucrats who up to the spring of 1789 still walked the gardens at Versailles. Representative governments also nurtured very different forms of commercial life. Absolutist monarchs encouraged commerce and industry, but only by controlling them through licenses, privileges, and state-sponsored inventiveness and monopolies. By contrast, the steam engines of the British industrialists with their self-regulating condensers and feedback devices went hand in hand with the self-regulation of relatively free enterprise, assisted by wider though hardly universal access to elections, political parties, lobbying, and parliamentary committees. When in 1776 Adam Smith wrote about the invisible hand that guaranteed the stability of an apparently chaotic market, he could do so because he relied upon the hand of the Great Mathematician, the God of Newtonian science.

Smith’s imagery was accompanied by a new reality. The Industrial Revolution—to this day the model of what science and technology can offer to agricultural societies seeking to escape poverty—occurred in part because more than any other place in Western Europe, eighteenth-century Britain witnessed the application of mechanical science to the manufacturing and transportation systems. In continental Europe that application was delayed and industrialization only accelerated after the French Revolution.

Throughout the West, constitutional, republican, and democratic forms of government proved to be more compatible with the needs and interests of industrialists. In every country where they achieved political power, they revised the curriculum of the schools and universities to reflect the importance of scientific education and to enshrine the heroic model of science. The Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution paved the way for the importation of science and its methods into all the other branches of disciplined learning.

In the West the compelling progress attributed to science and technology arose in tandem with a distinctive political culture now almost exclusively associated with representative government. It is not clear if the Industrial Revolution can be imitated or reinvented in other essentially agricultural societies, but it is clear that the penetration of scientific and technological knowledge deep into society hastened industrialization. Historians can affirm that in the eighteenth century a new scientific culture worked to greatest advantage in conjunction with representative and relatively free capitalist, as opposed to absolutist, systems of government. Because historically their success was tied to intellectual freedom and representative institutions, science and technological innovation belong on the side of the long and continuing struggle for democracy. Western science’s originating moment coincided with, as well as it reinforced, commercial expansion, enlightened reform, and revolution. In gratitude for escaping medieval restraints—and forgetting or ignoring the miseries caused by early industrialization—Westerners gave science an aura of absolute validity.





The Cultural Wars of the Enlightenment



A century before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the opponents of absolutism had already seized upon science as a weapon in their arsenal. What better than to take up a new body of knowledge that rested upon a new standard of truth—human reason, experiment, observation, mathematics—and new forms of social communication—scientific societies, academies, public lectures and printed texts, freely circulated. As a cultural war, the Enlightenment began in the 1690s. In the ensuing fray, critics attacked established churches, religious dogmas, kings, even devils and witches, as either deluded or the upholders of backward-looking tyrannies, ignorance, prejudice, and superstition. John Toland’s Christianity Not Mysterious (1696) lashed out at Christian dogmas and mysteries as irrational. In the anonymous Treatise on the Three Impostors (1719), Jesus, Moses, and Mohammed were condemned as the three, while Voltaire’s famous Candide (1759), castigated slavery, most religions, and the pomposity of the aristocracy. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, ideas were put into print that were unimaginable twenty years earlier, but that, much to the horror of the clergy, became commonplace twenty years later. These ideas remain to this day feared and hated, and where tyrannical political power still exists, great harm can befall their believers. In late 1992 the Saudi Arabian government beheaded a twenty-three-year-old man because, it said, he had “insulted God, the holy Koran, and Muhammad the prophet.”13

In Western Europe the decades prior to the 1690s were typically a time of bitter religious warfare and political upheaval. But in the final decade of the century, the established pattern of intolerance clashed with a new cultural force. Newly empowered English and exiled French Protestants pitted science and liberal political theory against the Catholic Church and divinely sanctioned monarchs. The exiled Huguenots were the highly motivated gadflies and propagandists for religious toleration, citizen participation, and government by contract rather than fiat. In 1685, Louis XIV had given them an ultimatum: convert or leave. He wanted one king and one faith. The French monarch’s effort to eliminate the Protestant minority had been underway for some decades, but only in the 1680s did Louis and his ministers think they could achieve the final consolidation of the absolutist state. Go into the jail records still surviving in Paris and there listed below the name of the inmate read the crime against “king and faith”: “Protestant.”

A pure, Catholic state would more loyally obey the glorious Sun King—at least so went the theory behind absolutism. Louis XIV got his way against the French Protestants, but not without first creating within France and much of the rest of Western Europe a new dissident counterculture. Its strength derived, however, from events far outside the borders of France. In England in 1688–89, Anglicans and other political dissenters from the effort to impose absolutism and Catholicism effected a successful coup d’état. They exiled King James II, brought in a new king and queen, and insisted on government by parliament, a bill of rights, and legal religious toleration for all Protestants. The Revolution of 1688–89—sometimes called “Glorious”—gave unprecedented constitutional life to parliamentary government in England and ushered in an era of legally protected freedom of the press and religious toleration. Suddenly the persecution across the Channel in France began to look like more than simply another example of state-enforced orthodoxy. Reformers opened a cultural war against absolutist monarchy and in favor of representative government, one that also ranged the secular against the religious, and religious toleration against what was labeled ignorance and prejudice.

By the 1690s in France, Protestants had been either rebaptized or locked up in the Bastille along with counterfeiters, thieves, and even alchemists. Among the exiled were many Protestant intellectuals who took their journalistic skills with them to England, to the American colonies, or to Protestant cities like Amsterdam or Geneva. With their pens they created an idealized portrait of English government. Into the same enlightened story they wrote a newly triumphant parliament, Newtonian science, a restrained but established Protestant church, and legal toleration for all Protestants. The chorus of protest against absolutism soon included new voices like the philosophe Voltaire, who claimed that England was superior because of the absence there of legally protected social estates in which rights were largely a matter of birth or royally granted privileges. Anglophilia became the trademark of the emergent Enlightenment, and the philosophe—ranging from Pierre Bayle through to Benjamin Franklin and Mary Wollstonecraft—became a new cultural type who could be a pundit, prophet, fighter against tyranny and oppression, original thinker, elegant writer, sometime pornographer, reader of science, host of salons, or occasional freemason.

Relying on their reading of Locke and Newton, French exiles and philosophes rushed into print with any idea that looked dangerous to entrenched or repressive authority. “There is a mighty light which spreads itself over the world, especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland…. it is impossible but Letters and knowledge must advance in greater proportion than ever.”14 So wrote an English republican of the early eighteenth century to his friends, a circle of French exiles living in the Dutch Republic. The metaphor of light would survive throughout the century because it conjured up religious toleration and relative intellectual freedom and progress.

The Enlightenment—the era when modernity begins—got its name, as Kant explained later in the eighteenth century, from the enterprise of spreading light into the dark corners of the human mind. From the 1690s onward, science led the way. The philosophes grabbed learning out of the hands of the clergy and argued that all knowledge, whether about morality, or politics, or history, could be scientific. The goal in every area of inquiry became the objective search for general principles; all knowledge could be systematized. Even the acts of reading and speaking, the interaction of the human mind with language, whether ancient and Biblical or modern and non-Western, could be understood scientifically. As a consequence, the philosophes began to search for the roots of all languages while also inventing the first encyclopedias. In other words, the philosophes only started with the Principia. They reconstituted every branch of the existing knowledge tree and even invented new branches. To drive home the point, the French philosophe Diderot adorned his 1751 encyclopedia with the first graphical representation of the newly cultivated tree.

As part of their polemic, the philosophes pruned and cut as well as cultivated. They denigrated certain subjects and elevated others. In the process, history emerged as a discipline, not in its professional and scientific garb as it is now practiced, but in far more secular form than what Louis XIV’s chroniclers were writing. His admirers had written to show the hand of God at work in history, particularly at the French court. The philosophes discarded such pieties along with the Biblical account of human origins and destiny. They emulated English writers like Lord Clarendon, who wrote the first history of the English civil wars, and especially the Whig apologists, who wrote to justify the Revolution of 1688. By the late eighteenth century, historians initiated a practice now familiar to anyone who has read a history book. They read old documents and chronicles for what they could reveal about the people who wrote them. They began to examine what professional historians subsequently called primary or original sources.

Along with a secularized approach to history, the European philosophes also developed new approaches toward old languages and texts. Reading old documents, indeed reading any document, is never as simple as it looks. Even picking up the local newspaper you ask, well, why did they run that story? Or, I wonder what party that journalist has joined? In effect, the practitioners of secularized history began to ask those sorts of questions of every text, including, most outrageously, the Bible. The criticism of texts, how they are read and interpreted, was known in the eighteenth century as it is today as “hermeneutics” or by the older term “philology.” Once it had been the preserve of pious monks poring over ancient fragments or of Protestants eager to disprove the Catholic Church’s interpretation of a Scriptural text. All that changed during the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.

Beginning with the new dictionaries and encyclopedias, enlightened literary criticism, the hermeneutical art, subjected myths and stories to rigorous scrutiny. Ruled out of court were the Biblical stories and the fables of the ancients. While the contents of any museum illustrate that eighteenth-century artists adored the ancient gods, secularized intellectuals did not. Most of the philosophes thought gods and their myths to be barbarous, the imaginative handiwork of deceitful storytellers and priests. The philosophes also cast a cold eye on church history; just writing about churches served in their view to elevate them. The language in a text, the words on the page, became too important to be left to clerical interpreters. The words had to be enlisted in the enterprise of creating wholly secular and scientific learning, but with consequences for learning only recently apparent. In the cultural wars of the present generation, language, with the many uses and abuses that can be attributed to it, has figured prominently in the arsenal of weapons.

To make hermeneutics over into their service, the philosophes had to combat over fifteen centuries of Christian tradition. In those centuries Biblical scholars laid claim to the Word of God as their province. They invented hermeneutics. They classified words, found their origin, assessed their meaning by reference to other texts written at the time, all for the purpose of assisting with the meaning of Scriptural passages. In their understanding of Genesis, Moses was the first historian, and the creation and deluge were actual and decisive events in the past. The beginning of the world could be dated with precision; some said so too could its end. Seventeenth-century Biblical hermeneuticists, most of them clergymen, pieced together all the ancient textual evidence they could find and concluded that God created the world around 4000 B.C. Then human history began, and its continuing enactment occurs in the shadow of the supernatural. Protestant clergymen went even further. They also sought evidence about the end of history, about the second coming of Christ and the millennium, and they subjected the words of the Bible to intense scrutiny to find it. They believed that if they could pin down the chronology of the ancient kingdoms, close textual reading combined with mathematical computation might predict the end of the world.

In their cultural warfare against the clergy and the Biblical version of hermeneutics, the philosophes of the Enlightenment contemptuously dismissed church history and the millennium. They labeled people who go around predicting the end of the world enthusiasts or madmen. They satirized pious interpretations of texts which seemed to contradict everyday experience or flew in the face of the new science. The Bible may say that the sun moves, they argued, but that is just a pious metaphor analogous to the tall stories found in the Greek legends. Using fossil evidence, the French philosophe Buffon, one of the founders of geology, rejected the starting date 4000 B.C. as an irrelevant piety.

If the Biblical account of history could be disproved, then history became an entirely human and secular domain, an infinitude of time with no one in charge. But philosophes did not stop with fossils. Being almost to a man graduates of religious schooling, they simply expropriated the techniques of hermeneutics for their own uses. Why confine close textual analysis to the fables of the Bible and thus by default leave the clergy in charge? The Enlightenment elevated hermeneutics into a tool for critical inquiry in every branch of learning. With so many assaults being waged on traditional learning, with so many battles being engaged in the cultural war, Diderot described the follower of the Enlightenment as an eclectic, a skeptic and investigator who “trampling underfoot prejudice, tradition, venerability, universal assent, authority—in a word, everything that overawes the crowd—dares to think for himself, to ascend to the clearest general principles, to examine them, to discuss them, to admit nothing save on the testimony of his own reason and experience.”15

Created by eclectics, skeptics, anticlericals, scientists, religious exiles, and journalists, the Enlightenment set the terms of the modern cultural project: the individual’s attempt to understand nature and humankind through scientific as well as linguistic means, methods that have now been brought into every branch of learning. In the midst of so many repressive societies and governments, “the majority of them despotic,” the reformers of the eighteenth century proclaimed in their books and journals the existence of “a certain empire, which holds sway over only the mind.” That empire “we honor with the name Republic, because it preserves a measure of independence, and because it is almost its essence to be free. It is the empire of talent and of thought.”16 Its members “form a species by their merit, and fain a reputation as brilliant as that of the great powers of the earth.” In this far from modest vision, a new kind of person emerged in the eighteenth century: hard to govern, suspicious of authority, more interested in personal authenticity and material progress than in the preservation of traditions, a reader of new literature, novels, newspapers, clandestine manuscripts, even pornography, all especially produced for an urban market that grew decade by decade.

Since the Enlightenment defined the modern idea of the individual, philosophers and political movements hostile to the Western cultural enterprise have focused on the Enlightenment. They attack one of its primary tenets: the autonomous individual as a cultural ideal. Where Immanuel Kant celebrated the emancipation of the individual mind from the fetters of prejudice and superstition, others have seen a more dangerous product. Critics on the right have seen this individual autonomy as subversive of church, state, or community, and more recently, critics claiming a place on the left have seen the glorification of reason as a dangerous illusion or as an excuse for repression and greed, or as simply and singularly a mask for colonial aggression and male domination. Both sides, then and now, sense that Kant’s motto for the Enlightenment, “Dare to know,” was never an idle threat.

From the vantage point of the West in the twentieth century, cultural wars can sometimes look like the pastimes of intellectuals with too much time on their hands. But the Enlightenment acquired a distinct political meaning. From the French Revolution onward its opponents blamed the Enlightenment for having caused revolution. In the present, cynics who say Western democratic ideology sanctioned racism and sexism condemn the Enlightenment for its smugness, elitism, and myopia about Western imperialism. Most philosophies are, after all, dead white European males.

However arrogant and myopic, the philosophes of the Enlightenment had sought truth with a purpose: the reform of existing institutions. Their passion had been ignited by the late-seventeenth-century revulsion against absolutism, against the French government’s persecution of Protestants. But the philosophes wanted to move beyond religious intolerance and get to the heart of the problem. First they attacked the clergy, then religious dogmatism, and finally, after the movement had become international, their heirs went after the very structure of the old-regime governments. The late-eighteenth-century revolutions—the American included—cannot be understood without first understanding the power of enlightened ideals and the social setting which nourished them.

Under the banner of spreading science and toleration, the philosophes used the printing press to great effect. Literacy and reading focused by current affairs created a new public, and within the public sphere emerged what can be identified as civil society. Affluent urban readers with some leisure time created for themselves social lives outside of church and family in voluntary associations, political parties, reading clubs, scientific societies, salons, Masonic lodges, and literary and philosophical clubs, where educated men and some women met, read, and discussed separately from family, church, or state. This social milieu responded to enlightened ideals which were attractive to self-motivated, literate, comfortable individuals, hence to the individualism of commercial society at its very origins. Built into the needs of the commercially free and affluent was the desire for freedom to publish and to assemble as well as to buy and to sell. The commerce in Enlightenment, both as knowledge purchased in books and journals and as the lived experience of free associations, wedded the Enlightenment enterprise to Western market society, to a commerce that could include everything from cotton to slaves, and to the liberal conception of the autonomous individual. None of these mores or institutions were compatible with the traditional society and institutions of the West, with guilds, monasteries, convents, separate courts for clergy, monopolies controlled by state officials or censors, folk beliefs, and customary practices. Things were lost with the advent of modernity that had once given great consolation, even protection.

When faced with restrictive regimes, protective of traditional interests and intent upon controlling access to knowledge as well as to commerce, enlightened ideals could inspire revolution. First in 1776 and then in the 1780s, democratic revolutions broke out on both sides of the Atlantic, in the American colonies, then in the Dutch Republic, Belgium, and France. Drawing upon republican political ideals, some as old as the Renaissance, but adding to them a new faith in science and progress, late-eighteenth-century radicals and revolutionaries thought they were fulfilling the Enlightenment’s mandate. The cultural war waged by the intellectuals of the Enlightenment had revolutionary implications.

Out of the crucible of the eighteenth-century revolt against tradition came the human sciences, first history, then psychology, sociology, and anthropology. As professional disciplines they were created in the decades after the French Revolution and in response to it. The late-eighteenth-century revolutions suddenly made history and the human sciences in general vitally important. Assessing the meaning of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution became one of the important tasks of history. But that process of assessment was never a tame exercise in curriculum development. Because of the French Revolution, nineteenth-century advocates of the new social sciences were split ideologically as to the role the new disciplines should play in society. Liberal historians agreed with the Enlightenment enterprise of reform. Other social scientists and historians spurned the Enlightenment as the cause of the French Revolution and regarded both as aberrations that tragically departed from the long centuries of Western stability once ensured by monarchs, aristocracies, and churches.

But so well had the Enlightenment vision of science succeeded that neither side wanted to go back to the methods and practices used in the era before the Enlightenment. Both opponents and supporters of the French Revolution enlisted secularized history as their guide and weapon; and neither would give up the mantle of science. Conservative nineteenth-century historians such as the German Leopold von Ranke repudiated the Enlightenment’s program for reform. Liberal historians, often allied with the bourgeoisie of city and industry, built upon it and the legacy of the French Revolution and advocated radical change. Yet neither side went back to history as it had been in the hands of chroniclers, church apologists, or millenarians. In that sense the cultural wars of the eighteenth century were won by the philosophes. The discipline of history, as discussed in the next chapter, depended upon their achievements.





Protestant Science and the American University



The bold contrast between philosophe and cleric was always clearer in Catholic than in Protestant Europe. Louis XIV’s persecution of Protestants structured the polemics of secular culture for nearly a century. By the late eighteenth century the Enlightenment project looked very different in both Britain and America than it did in continental Europe. Differences also existed between the British and American responses to the irreligion and anticlericalism of the French philosophes. Schematically speaking, the Enlightenment began in Britain, crossed the Channel to the continent, where, particularly in France, its dissident counterculture took a violent turn against the clergy. In the last decades of the century, enlightened principles then traversed the Atlantic and were generally more cherished in the American colonies than in the Old World of their origin. The American enthusiasm for the Enlightenment, perhaps best exemplified in the life of Benjamin Franklin, took a practical direction toward scientific experimentation and political activism and largely bypassed the radical atheism of the French encyclopedists. By contrast, in the last decades of the eighteenth century all but the most radical British intellectuals had become suspicious of the Enlightenment. They associated it with atheism, then with rebellious colonists and finally with the excesses of the French Revolution. Running through the complex responses of the English-speaking world on both sides of the Atlantic is the thread of Protestantism.

Early-modern Protestants were heretics of the Word. They had made the Bible their weapon against the dogmas of the Roman Church. In addition, seventeenth-century English Protestants forged a distinctive alliance which would last in high culture well into the nineteenth century: science properly understood could support religion. The English Puritans of the mid-seventeenth century championed both Parliament and the Bible, and they were prepared to wage war against their king—beheading him in 1649. In the process they gave Anglo-American culture a distinctive understanding of science and religion. As a result, the American version of the Enlightenment was less angry, less anticlerical, and more confident of progress. The Protestant version of Enlightenment put Americans on a path that still influences cultural life. In other words, history matters: whatever their background, participants in American culture never entirely escape the colonial Protestant past and the Founding Fathers’ receptivity to the Enlightenment.

In striking contrast to the continental Catholic clergy, seventeenth-century English Protestants and the Puritans who went to the American colonies thought that they could have their Bible along with their science. Both would be sticks they could use to beat the Roman Catholic or even the Anglican clergy. Baconianism helped to infuse their faith in science with Protestant piety. From Bacon they got explanations that thrilled the Protestant heart: “When it pleased God to call the Church of Rome to account for their degenerate manners and ceremonies…it was ordained by the Divine Providence, that there should attend withal a renovation and new spring of all other knowledge.”17 Bacon’s emphasis on collecting data and on painstaking, laborious experience as the key to knowledge in effect tied the Protestant work ethic to the empirical study of nature.

The nineteenth century Anglo-American view of science never entirely escaped its seventeenth-century Puritan and revolutionary context. The Puritans bequeathed to modern thought, and particularly to the nineteenth-century university, a union between God’s word and his work, between the study of the Bible and the study of natural science. This tradition established an important, distinctively Anglo-American variation on the heroic model of science: the scientist need not be at odds with the clergyman. He could be pious yet enterprising in the pursuit of natural knowledge. His religiosity might be more cerebral than emotional, but it could also be vaguely, even deeply Christian.

Had the continental and atheistic version of the Enlightenment triumphed over the Anglo-American Protestant version of science, both British and American universities of the nineteenth century would have been far more secular institutions than in fact they were. But until well into the nineteenth century the heroic understanding of science and the Bible coexisted in American and British universities. The demise of the Bible in English-speaking universities occurred only slowly, and then after a midcentury struggle in which scientists enlisted every intellectual ally they could muster. Now mature disciplines, history, hermeneutics, geology, coupled with the all-important new Darwinian evolutionary science, contributed decisively to the dethroning of the Bible. It was as if Anglo-Americans waited until the mid-nineteenth century to fight (and win) the last battle of the Enlightenment.

Until then, Anglo-American universities rejected the materialism, atheism, and anticlericalism associated with science by the continental philosophes. In effect, they sheltered themselves under a compromise between what Protestants liked to call God’s work, i.e., science, and God’s word, the Bible. In the 1880s, the head of a leading American state university prescribed that “in choosing members of the faculty the greatest care should be taken to secure gifted, earnest, reverent men, whose mental and moral qualities will fit them to prepare their pupils for manly and womanly work in promoting our Christian civilization.”18 In 1915, it was still “customary in state universities, no less than in denominational colleges, to question a candidate for appointment concerning his church connections. Any church connection will do,” claimed an article in The Nation.19

Yet the compromise between work and word had always been fragile. Gradually after the 1850s it collapsed as historians and scientists forged an alliance aided by the new hermeneutics. This controversy can be seen as a repeat performance of the way eighteenth-century continental philosophes had structured their cultural war with the clergy. A small group of English and American geologists first challenged the original Baconian compromise when they sought to research and lecture about geology as if the Bible had nothing of importance to say geologically. “The physical part of geological inquiry ought to be conducted as if the Scriptures were not in existence,” Lyell had asserted in 1832.20 The separation of geology from Biblical history required nonetheless an attack on the scientific validity of Biblical stories. Victorian geologists such as Adam Sedgwick and William Whewell, both Anglican clergymen teaching at Cambridge University, labored to expose the contradictions and inconsistencies in the Biblical stories by the use of philology, ancient history, and fossil remains. The holy text could now be read like every other text and be submitted to the scrutiny of scientific hermeneutics.

Just as the philosophes had prescribed, nineteenth-century scientific hermeneutics turned the scientific method on the Bible itself, anchored it historically and linguistically, and asked that its words be related to other words in other historical texts. Put bluntly, the Bible was relativized. Once opened to hermeneutical scrutiny the words about the seven days of creation became merely linguistic puzzles to be unraveled by reference to ancient cosmologies as revealed in other texts from related times and places. In taking on the Bible within a Protestant context, scientific history armed with hermeneutics met the last challenge to its dominance over the story of the past and emerged triumphant. Interpreting the Bible literally became the province of religious fundamentalists, not something that educated people could bring themselves any longer to do.

Leveling the status of the Bible also cleared a space wherein a mature history of science emerged. Emboldened by the victory of history and hermeneutics, secular intellectuals looked for new objects of inquiry. If history and hermeneutics could ally with science in order to establish the autonomy of all three from religion, then history and hermeneutics could be joined together triumphantly in writing the history of science itself. Such an enterprise would give further stature to science, and it would therefore also defeat those who thought that only Christian gentlemen should be allowed to teach in the universities. Self-consciously polemical, scientific and secularized historians began to write the first histories of science, of science triumphant. These first Anglo-American histories of science sought to show the truth of science and to affirm its heroic nature as value-free, separate from social influences, true and objective.

Andrew Dickson White, a founder of Cornell University, was the greatest nineteenth-century historian of science. In his A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896), White described the authority of Scripture as “the tyranny of sacred books imperfectly transcribed, viewed through distorting superstitions, and frequently interpreted by party spirit.”21 White devoted nearly half of his two-volume history of science to the rise and importance of hermeneutics (what he called philology or higher criticism). It had shown that the Biblical stories were based upon myths and legends, interesting in themselves, but meaningless as either history or geology. The scientific study of the Biblical texts, in White’s view, was “a service rendered to humanity…in substituting a new and correct rendering for the old reading of the famous text…which had for ages done so much to make our sacred books a fetish.”22

Together, history and hermeneutics would liberate both themselves and science from clerical influence. White also praised the Morrell Act of 1862 which set aside public lands in every state for the establishment of universities where science and technical education could be taught along with the humanities and social sciences.23 It marked a great step forward in placing science and technical education on an equal footing with classical literature while also democratizing American higher education, and assisting in breaking the clergy’s hold over higher education.

For White, science, history, and hermeneutics together formed a liberal and progressive bulwark against backward-looking historical forces. Laymen like White and his liberal and secular allies, such as the historian Herbert Baxter Adams, wanted the education of young gentlemen to be taken away from the clergy with their Bibles and placed in the hands of a laity with scientific training. Celebrating the eventual triumph of this secular vision, White concluded that “on both sides of the Atlantic the great majority of the leading institutions of learning are under the sway of enlightened public opinion as voiced mainly by laymen [and thus] the physical and natural sciences are henceforth likely to be developed normally, and without fear of being sterilized by theology, or oppressed by ecclesiastism.”24 In other words, White believed that the heroic model of science had taken over the curriculum of American universities. In the long run he proved to be right.

The educational and intellectual reforms of the late nineteenth century did indeed create a professionally trained class of gentlemen leaders as well as historians who could teach and write about the triumph of their values: science; liberty as conceived by the English gentry and enshrined in the American constitution; reason; republican virtue.25 In the final triumph of the American Enlightenment, White and his allies firmly attached a triumphant history of heroic science to the ideals of the secular republic.

What such men had not foreseen was the arrival into the American republic of thousands of immigrants, few of them middle-class Protestants and many of them Catholics and Jews. White and his liberal allies had envisioned the new state universities as places that would educate enlightened white men of Protestant background in applied science. Although they specifically linked this education to industrialization, they did not imagine it as education for the workers. The liberal and secular reformers of the late nineteenth century sought no change in the class or racial origins of the men who would govern the country. They simply wanted them to have a more secular and hence more scientific orientation. Women never even figured in their plans.

White’s view of the warfare between science and theology (he carefully tried to say that it was not between science and religion per se) was widely held by Anglo-American historians until very recently. Even those who claimed that Western religious doctrines encouraged the birth of modern science have embraced the fundamental doctrine bequeathed by the Victorians: science is a separate body of knowledge, immune from the subjectivity of all other branches of knowledge, which should wherever possible follow its example. In the Anglo-American tradition, the history of science allied science with liberalism and elevated both to the altar of reason and the secular republic. The followers of science worshipped in a temple where ignorance, censorship, bigotry, and superstition—sometimes equated with religion—had no pew.

The twentieth-century followers of White’s vision of the history of science wrote about such exemplars of seventeenth-century English science as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton in ways that left out their extraordinary religiosity. Historians of science taught right up to the 1960s that the greatest tension these heroes had to reconcile was between their science and their religion.26 It never occurred to anyone that the two might have been so merged as to be for them inseparable. The borders between heroic science, religion, and, of course, magic were reinforced smugly and assuredly, by a history of heroic science emanating from American and British universities.

The American university was the creation of a distinct and inherited version of Western high culture: secular because of late-nineteenth-century reformers like White, deeply confident in the power of heroic science, and committed to excellence in every branch of science and technology, regardless of how or to what purpose it might be applied. In the field of history, students were meant to learn the political narrative of Western development with particular attention to American and British institutions. English, American, and foreign-language literature departments utilized and taught hermeneutic techniques based on the close readings of great texts. Such works were deemed suitable as the replacement for what had once been the centerpiece of all Anglo-American literary education, the Bible.

American universities transmitted a legacy of essentially eighteenth-century origin: the Enlightenment as understood in the Protestant and republican culture of the original colonies and as modified in the late-nineteenth-century process that enshrined science and hermeneutics. This was a powerful legacy, embraced with an absolute confidence once accorded only to churches and kings. The teaching of history, whether about parliaments or science—from Plato to NATO—seemed only to reinforce the wisdom of the turn taken in the eighteenth century, the success of the Enlightenment enterprise. The heroic model of science ensured the truth-seeking of the other disciplines against charges of being nothing but the self-serving artifice of old elites. In this self-confident atmosphere the discipline of history flourished until well into the 1960s. Anchored by well-enrolled surveys of Western civilization and American democracy, history was one of the major beneficiaries of the confidence in progress that science, heroically conceived, had built.
