title: 3 History Makes a Nation
---







BY THE TIME the United States became a nation in 1776, history had been wrenched from the hands of balladeers and chroniclers and entrusted to the philosophes, who were busy sinking the firm footings of rational inquiry under all forms of knowledge. Still dazzled by the ability of Newton to explain the solar system, many Western thinkers came to believe that the movements of human beings, like those of celestial bodies, could be comprehended through scientific laws. This intellectual shift made the past more than a repository of facts, because it now seemed to contain clues about the direction of the future.

In this transit from poetry and chronicles to social science, historians took on the responsibility of sifting through the facts about past events in search of the underlying logic shaping the course of social development. Influenced by Herder and Hegel, they asserted that a new political entity, the nation, embodied human purposes and hence should be studied for its clues about the meaning in unfolding events. Thus history and science, which had recently been converted into sources of information about the human enterprise, became intimately associated with a third modern force, the nation.

Nations themselves had become prominent parts of the European landscape, because in the early nineteenth century the wars of the French Revolution had carried radical reform to France’s neighbors, toppling assorted European monarchs from their thrones. Where the word “kingdom” indicated a territory belonging to a single ruler and “country” suggested a land where people had lived long together as subjects, “nation” evoked the very modern concept of men and women self-consciously banded together into a political union. With nationalism as an engine of political and social reform, people looked to national history to illuminate the course of human progress that had brought modern nations into being.

Nations figure as places on the map or as sovereign states resplendently personified at international gatherings. Their definition as collections of people is much more elusive despite the fact that nations only exist because of the will of their citizens to accept themselves as a unified body. Watching the fierce loyalties of ethnicity dissolve national states in Eastern Europe, one cannot help but wonder what are the invisible ties that weld a people into a nation. For Americans at the time of independence, that question was highly pertinent, because they had to create the sentiments of nationhood which other countries took for granted. There was no uniform ethnic stock, no binding rituals from an established church, no common fund of stories, only a shared act of rebellion. Americans had to invent what Europeans inherited: a sense of solidarity, a repertoire of national symbols, a quickening of political passions.

The superior resources for fixing a national identity which Americans lacked and other countries enjoyed were well depicted in a French schoolboy’s geography text of the 1960s. The book’s centerfold featured a line of French men and boys, visually paired by their clothing, stretching across two pages like a string of paper dolls. At the far left, the man and boy, obviously father and son, were dressed in contemporary clothes, the man holding the hand of the next boy, who wore knickers and knee-high boots with his father in a double-breasted suit and fedora. The next pair were dressed in the fashion of the turn of the century, and so on across the two pages, ending with a Carolingian father in doublet and hose. No viewer could miss the essence of French nationhood; it sprang from an unbroken chain of French fathers who had lived long in the land and propagated. This imaginative drawing graphically captured that fact while underscoring the masculine underpinnings of modern nationalism.

With the ratification of a new American Constitution in 1789, a structure of central authority came into being in the United States (a noun used with a plural verb at the time), but only a handful of Americans—most of them revolutionary leaders—felt the national sentiments necessary for the survival of the new political creation. As one contemporary metaphorically noted, the new Constitution had raised a federal roof without federal walls. Twenty years later, the problem was less acute, but still a subject of concern. In 1809, during the last month he spent in the White House, Thomas Jefferson received a letter from the Westward Mill Library Society of New Brunswick County, Virginia, inviting his patronage. “Our society,” the secretary wrote the president, “is composed of farmers, mechanics, Justices of the Peace, ministers of the Gospel—Military Officers, Lawyers, School masters—merchants—postmasters, one member of the Assembly & one member of Congress.” He then gave the names of the six directors for the year: “Hubbard Hobbs—John Harrison (both planters) Joseph Percivall (a naturalized citisen), Jesse Coe (an Elder in the Methodist Church) Joseph Saunders (a Deacon in the Baptist church) and Mark Green (a Major in the Militia of Virginia).” In closing his letter the secretary posed an arresting question: “Query will such an heterogeneous body ever firmly…coalesce?”1 Here in microcosm was the macrocosmic problem of the American people, the ideological imperative of E Pluribus Unum, the intensely felt need to create a union from the disparate groups that formed their country.





The Problem of National Identity



Much has been said and written about Americans’ pride in their unique heritage, but before being transmogrified into a single heritage, the conspicuous differences among the people of the United States caused much uneasiness. Americans knew that the ideal of a commonwealth was one king, one church, and one tongue, and certainly colonial leaders had striven to achieve that organic unity. The Revolution offered patriots the rhetorical opportunity to treat America’s social diversity as a summons to a new kind of nationhood, but old sensibilities lingered on. What a successful War for Independence could not supply were the shared sentiments, symbols, and social explanations necessary for an integrative national identity. Much of the bombast about America’s unique calling to nurture freedom for the entire human race should be heard as rather nervous whistling in the dark or, more accurately, whistling through the graveyard of failed republics unable to secure the unity and solidarity that monarchies imposed.

Scholarly preoccupation with political history has encouraged the view that national integration was largely a matter of muting the autonomous tendencies of thirteen once-sovereign states or of working out compromises among antagonistic sections of the United States rather than one of creating a common identity to undergird the whole. The Westward Mill Library Society presents the situation in its most mundane form: could a people split into a dozen religious denominations, shedding the social forms that separated mechanics from militia majors, divided between native-born and naturalized citizens, unify? And if so, on which and whose terms? Could Americans will themselves into a national culture as they had willed themselves into a War for Independence?

As one might expect from an activity which distributed social power, fashioning a national self-image became itself a contentious process. The fighting of the War for Independence had not turned Americans into a united people. Rather it had created the problem of nationalism—that imperative to form a more perfect union once the practical tasks of fighting a common enemy and securing a peace treaty no longer exerted centripetal pressure. The citizens of the United States at the end of the Revolution had not only not lived long in their land; the land they lived in wasn’t even theirs. Until recently much of it had belonged to other people. Indeed, the domain they coveted beyond the Appalachian Mountains still remained part of the ancestral holdings of Amerindians.

Caught geographically between native Americans and Europeans, Americans were also betwixt two rationales for the social use of land: the European doctrines bestowing land to countries capable of “effective occupation” and the Indians’ belief that human societies could no more own land than they could own the sun and air. The apologetics for conquest which had served a European power like Great Britain had little usefulness to the independent United States. In the age of exploration, European navigators, enjoying the patronage of monarchs, had sallied forth from metropolitan centers where their right to conquer was recognized at home and their might made right abroad. Their religious evangelical traditions accommodated—even encouraged—the subjugation of heathen peoples while their hierarchical political forms greatly facilitated governing others in distant lands. Uniquely situated, the new American nation was an alien European outpost perched on the Atlantic shelf of a vast continent, its legal link to Great Britain severed by rebellion. An alternative line of reasoning was required to explain why the new republic should send its people to dislodge the native inhabitants of the vast North American continent.

The thirteen now-independent states represented a hodgepodge from which to form a nation. Only retrospectively can historians assign to their similarities more prominence than their differences. The commonalities that did exist among them—those of language, law, and institutional history—all pointed in the wrong direction, backward to the past, toward an association with England, whose utility as a contemptible oppressor could not easily be done without. Their common Protestant heritage looks homogeneous only retrospectively. At the time a dozen or more denominations and sects warred against each other, most claiming for their doctrines an exclusive orthodoxy. There was one common and inspiring document—the Declaration of Independence—but its self-evident truths that all men were created equal proved more divisive than conciliating, in a society of slave-holders.

The American Revolution had not produced a nation, much less a unified people. The Constitution provided new institutions for national governance, but its very success in removing power from local majorities worked against the forming of a popular, patriotic culture. Even the Philadelphia delegates who gathered in 1787 to consider strengthening the central government made the case for a more perfect union not through appeals to symbol and sentiment, but in a lawyerly fashion that emphasized procedures and structures. They built their argument for a reconstructed national government on reasoned discussions about defensive strategies against foreign powers and interstate cooperation for trading purposes.

Despite the openness of the ratification process with its specially elected conventions in the states, the fifteen-hundred-odd delegates who debated the constitutional plan during 1787 and 1788 represented an extension of the revolutionary elite. They earned their offices in free elections while retaining the political mores of a closed ruling body. Theirs was a nationalism of practical wisdom. Outside their circles of political conversation, there were few shared assumptions operating at the intimate level of human experience and a paucity of positive symbols easily recognized from one end of the Atlantic shelf to the other. Theirs was a nation without a national ideology, save the shared understandings of its leaders. Indeed, the Founding Fathers offered a neocolonial answer to the problem of unity—direction from the center exercised by officials deliberately holding themselves aloof from the people.

Americans’ self-congratulation at their success in establishing a new and more powerful federal government did stimulate enthusiasm for their new career in self-government. The return of prosperity after a postrevolutionary depression also strengthened confidence in the republican experiment, but the working out of the content of American identity did not take place until the mid-1790s, when the events of the French Revolution converged with new development in American domestic politics.

Quite unexpectedly, the proclamation of the French Republic called forth a new cohort of American radicals, most of them too young to have engaged in the protests against the British. They took up the French cause as their own, finding in the destructive fury of 1793 a confirmation of the portentousness of the moment. The French Revolution opened the way for a reinterpretation of the American Revolution as the initial act in a historic drama of liberation, now sweeping Europe. The French embrace of newness itself suggested that the novelties of American society were harbingers of things to come rather than egregious examples of raw provincialism.

Long uprooted from their European past, American citizens could plant themselves in the imaginative soil of a visionary future. The rhetoric of Republican France roused political passions in the United States at the very time that members of Washington’s administration were congratulating themselves upon having achieved stability through the workings of an energetic central government. The hoped-for deference from ordinary voters dissolved into a round of public demonstrations in support of French military victories. Political clubs formed in flagrant imitation of the Jacobins, and Republican newspapers were founded for the sole purpose of attacking the government.

In an unusually probing analysis of the social basis for elite power, the new radicals—who called themselves Republicans—precipitated a divisive controversy about popular political participation itself. Thus disputes about specific issues brought to light even more profound disagreements about the nature of democratic governance. Their denunciatory attacks on the established authorities continued unabated until the election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800. Jefferson won the presidency in an exuberantly contentious campaign which sharply defined the choices between gentry rule and popular power, changing forever the nation’s political culture and fixing the character of participatory politics in the United States for the next sixty years.

At the same time, America had entered into a period of great commercial prosperity—in part a consequence of its role in shipping as a neutral carrier for the belligerent nations of Europe. This prosperity promoted the construction of roads, the extension of postal services, and the founding of newspapers in country towns. A dense new communication network vastly increased the resonance of partisan disputes. The control over information and opinions once exercised by an elite had been wrested away by articulate critics of the elite. Male literacy outside the South approached the 90 percent level, with female literacy following the same upward climb. The tactical advantages that accrued to an upper class small enough for concerted action were now overpowered by the mobilization of popular majorities through print campaigns.





History and National Identity



In retrospect one can see that the French Revolution enabled Americans to liberate themselves from the Eurocentric orientation of their colonial past, but it was a socially specific liberation. The Federalists’ defeat at the polls predisposed many elite families to withdraw from national politics and leave the issue of nationalism for others to define. The rambunctious politics of the 1790s brought disillusionment to a number of cultural nationalists like Noah Webster, Charles Brockden Brown, and Samuel Latham Mitchill who had expected the free institutions of America to promote literature, science, and scholarship. Their nationalist fervor had been nourished by fantasies of American greatness in areas marked out by the high civilization of metropolitan Europe. For them the outburst of revolutionary passion from uneducated men had proved the conservatives right: when the pot boils the scum rises. The political rejection of the Federalists reflected more than a change of personnel; it marked the defeat of a venerable conception of authority while creating a new sense of what it was to be American.

Those who were liberated from America’s traditional orientation to Europe were the ordinary men and women who sought affirmation of their tastes and values in the celebration of what was distinctively American: its institutional permissiveness, its pervasive practicality, its reforming zeal, above all its expanded scope for action for ordinary people. In the decades that followed Jefferson’s election, the meaning of a democratic political order became manifest. People did not just want to vote; they wanted to experience full social participation—gathering in quasi-public meetings, debating matters of policy, mobilizing fellow citizens, and forming groups based on the affinities of conviction. The single most striking feature of the early republic’s social life came from the spontaneous generation of thousands of voluntary associations, a phenomenon that announced the arrival of an American public, a body of men and women actively committed to participating in the life of the nation and to interpreting the significance of the United States.

The formation of new voluntary associations was only limited by the reigning social imagination. There was even an Association of American Patriots for the Purpose of Forming a National Character, started in 1808. Organizations formed to build circulating libraries, like the Westward Mill Library Society that had written to Jefferson, abounded. The zeal for self-improvement found outlets in debating and study clubs, a particular favorite among young adults. Fire societies multiplied with the growth of cities along with other mutual benefit associations. Almost all religious denominations had auxiliaries. Women were unusually active in this new associational life as the principal organizers for the provision of charity, founding female domestic missionary societies and homes for friendless women in every town.

The most common impulse promoting voluntary clubs was the urge to reform society—often prompted by a religious revival. First and most enduringly there was the temperance movement, then reform of prisons and hospitals, sabbatarianism, later nativism, and, most productive of reforming zeal, the antislavery movement. There were literally hundreds of antislavery societies, many flourishing in the South. These multifarious voluntary associations revealed an efficiency in mobilizing recruits and in circulating information that far exceeded anything done by public authority.

Where the educated elite had wished to establish national identity upon the basis of America’s distinctive contributions to established realms of achievement, the reformers and revivalists were expressing a different sense of nationhood. For them the United States represented a new kind of social existence in which personal fulfillment came through public initiatives. The activists’ optimism about concerted efforts to eliminate slavery, correct the treatment of the insane and criminal, reorganize charity, and raise the tone of public morals became a part of American character. Solidarity in this highly mobile society would be fashioned from the outpouring of energy devoted to social betterment. Defeating the establishment’s presidential candidate, mobilizing volunteers for a dozen reform activities, asserting a right to define the content of Americanism, the public spokesmen who emerged in the 1790s saw well that they could build their own national structure on the revolutionary foundation.

During these same years, nationalism became a powerful force throughout Europe, not just in the United States. Swept up by the revolutionary momentum begun in France, more and more people began to think of themselves as citizens with new responsibilities to assume in the public realm where science was fostered, history written, and social policy determined. The new industrial order began luring people to factory jobs in burgeoning cities, breaking up the intimate communities of an older, agrarian world. Industrialization also promoted literacy and cheap printing, which meant that newspapers and journals designed for a large reading public became widely available. Shared information, shared stories, shared symbols invisibly pulled adult readers into a new association dependent upon the mutual ties of language, commerce, and governance. With these common reference points, people could form what Benedict Anderson has called an “imagined community” to take the place of the intensely real rural communities they left behind.2

Sensing that written records of the American Revolution could supply the deficiency of venerable traditions, religious uniformity, and common descent, the aging witnesses of the Revolution took up their pens in the closing years of the eighteenth century. Moved by their own awe at the momentousness of the events of the 1770s, they wrote their country’s first histories, filling the “imagined community” of American nationalism with the details of heroism and virtue generated by the war itself. Most ambitious in this exploitation of memory were a half-dozen men and one woman who embarked on multivolume studies, almost all of them drawing on personal experience. John Marshall found time from his duties as Supreme Court chief justice to write a life of George Washington, whom he had first encountered at Valley Forge when he was a twenty-one-year-old Virginia regular. David Ramsay and Hugh Williamson had served as surgeons in the Continental Army; Edmund Randolph accompanied Washington to Boston as an aide-de-camp before he became a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress. The historians Jeremy Belknap, Benjamin Trumbull, and William Gordon, all Congregational clergymen, preached to the troops in the field. Mercy Otis Warren, whose brother and husband were famous Boston patriots, wielded a pen in part because her sex denied her the opportunity to take up “manly arms” against the British.3

Writing from both sides of the rancorous divide of the 1790s, these historians showed a remarkable disinclination to fan the flames of partisanship, preferring to use history to create artificially the “mystic chords of memory” the nation lacked. Ardent nationalists themselves, they constructed a common past which projected the national distinctiveness of the United States into the future, more specifically the republican character of the new government and the country’s destiny to be, as Warren wrote, “an enviable example to all the world of peace, liberty, righteousness, and truth.”4 A history of fresh beginnings and founders’ intentions quickly took shape as patriotic writers created a compelling historical narrative which interpreted the Declaration of Independence as the culmination of a long colonial gestation period.

These original efforts served as a template for successive reworkings of the story of American nation-building. Its fundamental assumptions were not challenged for over a century. America, the infant of enlightened European parents, struggled for a new birth of freedom and clung to its principles rather than let “the last, best hope of mankind perish from this earth.”5 When Americans began self-consciously constructing a national identity, they emphasized those American practices and values which distinguished their society from the mores and institutions of old-regime Europe. In doing so, they became partisans in the raging battles between the defenders of hierarchical tradition and the champions of radical reform. Since the Enlightenment ideals which Americans called upon were themselves the objects of a long and contentious struggle over the nature of truth, Americans found themselves locked into a way of seeing themselves which was strongly derivative of European cultural wars. As we have already seen in the first chapters, two intellectual enterprises, history and science, had fused to form a powerful new philosophical synthesis in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. Both became part of the self-awareness of the citizens of the new nation. For Americans, democratic nationalism came to represent the principal vehicle of social progress. Blending the intellectual and nationalistic challenges of the Enlightenment, Americans looked at the history of the United States as a great predictor, foretelling the future of the world’s oppressed people who would one day throw off the yoke of oppression and come into their full human estate.

In the United States, the circulation of popular, consensus-building ideas and values was particularly critical in the absence of a patriotic folk culture. Detecting no conflict between their zeal for truth and their love for their own country, nineteenth-century writers provided the “imagined community” of the new nation with a history that was both patriotic and scientific. The growing conviction that democracy had a scientific foundation, e.g., that it was the only governmental form congruent with the known characteristics of human nature, encouraged Americans to think that theirs was a pathbreaking course which the rest of the world would follow. Yet the compatibility between nationalism and science could endure only so long as the search for meaning and the search for truth led to the same understanding of reality.

The explicit political philosophy of the Declaration of Independence suggested a mythic history in which individuals created government in order to secure their inherent rights. At the time, however, it took a highly imaginative reworking of historical materials to turn the Declaration into the logical termination of America’s colonial experience. People who lived through the Revolution knew with what sudden conviction Americans had chosen independence. While hardly novel in its propositions, the Declaration represented an unexpected eruption in the thirteen discrete histories of the colonies. Few people had earlier thought that these separate societies could or would want to unite as a nation; fewer still would have named an abstract philosophy of natural rights as the reason for their union. Colonial history had ended abruptly with the formation of the United States. That was certain, but turning this event into a destiny implicit in the original seventeenth-century settlements was a narrative invention.

If the Declaration was made to appear as the natural end point of colonial developments, then the independence of the United States could be understood as the climax to a long and heroic sequence of events. A story that tied the intentions of the first settlers to the fulfilling acts of the Revolution and Constitution could also create the bonds of union among the disparate groups that had rebelled against British rule. Within a generation, a powerful interpretive tradition had formed that did exactly this. Like a cluster of tributaries pouring into a mighty river, the discrete colonial pasts became part of a destiny tied to the expansion and power of a nation dedicated to nurturing both individualism and democracy. In this Benjamin Trumbull’s history was a model, integrating the diverse accounts of colonial origins into a single national narrative.6 Taught to successive generations of children and immigrants, this history enabled white Americans to orient themselves at home and abroad. Equally important, the history worked out in the early decades of the nineteenth century acquired the force of an uncontested truth.

In successfully shaping historical memory to these ends, personal and national identity were powerfully fused. One became an American by exhibiting the autonomy implicit in the natural rights doctrine. Collectively Americans loved their country because it promised to the world—in the words of the Gettysburg Address—“that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

There was no place in the first American histories for examining the variety of complex reasons that had brought Europeans to the North American continent, much less for taking stock of the enslavement and expulsion of peoples whose cultural values called into question the claimed universality of American ideals. Instead the intentionality of individuals was deduced from the general spirit of a free and independent nation. The convictions showcased by the Declaration of Independence and Constitution formed the glue that American nationalists used for pasting together the country’s component parts. In histories for students, the American Revolution was presented as the next most important event to the birth of Christ; as Ruth Elson concluded from a survey of nineteenth-century schoolbooks, “God both decreed and directed the American Revolution.”7 Meanwhile ministers and authors like Parson Mason Weems produced the myths appropriate for a national pantheon of heroes which an eager reading public consumed with enthusiasm. A new and compelling absolutism about national origins had been put in place, not to be dislodged for a full century.

Fortuitously, the doctrine of natural rights offered a justification for the conquest and subjugation of Amerindians. Because the native inhabitants repelled the efforts of Presidents Washington and Jefferson to get them to adopt the white man’s ways, they were placed outside the charmed circle of progress. Their indifference to American definitions of individual liberty and productive pursuits disqualified them from the unfolding plan for human improvement which science and history disclosed. They figured in the popular imagination as savages, but as superior, noble savages because they were the original occupants of the American continent.8 Historians fashioned a story that emphasized the determination of the original settlers to lay the foundation for an independent nation. The 169 years of colonial life became a prologue for the nation that was to be, a rendering of the past equivalent to our interpreting the present through the aspirations of those who will live in the twenty-second century.

With the writing of American history, the open-ended search for information about the past collided with the vigilant censors of patriotic pride. If the United States was to represent the fulfillment of precious political ideals, its founders must be presented as people with a mission, animated by enlightened intentions and intrepid spirits. The anthropologist Mary Douglas has described very well how history and democratic nationalism serve each other’s purposes: “Any institution that is going to keep its shape,” she has said, “needs to control the memory of its members.” Hence an institution—in this case a nation—causes its members “to forget experiences incompatible with its righteous image and it brings to their minds events which sustain the view…that is complimentary to itself.”9

During the nineteenth century, most of what really happened in the colonial era was forgotten because it conflicted with the imperatives of nation-building. Looking back upon the colonial era one discovered profoundly different concerns engaging people’s attention. The self-conscious crafters of American identity took great pride in religious freedom, but the colonial groups like the Puritans of New England openly embraced orthodoxy—banishing dissidents, whipping Baptists, even executing four Quakers. “Tolerance stinks in God’s nostrils,” the Puritan divine Nathaniel Ward announced. And so it went with free speech. Congress composed a Bill of Rights guaranteeing free speech, but colonial magistrates had been much more likely to jail their critics. And then of course there was the adoption of slave labor and the elaboration of slave codes by colonial legislators. How were those decisions to be integrated into the story of a peculiarly free people? This imaginative legerdemain became the work of America’s first historians, a category that includes the participants in the Revolution and the preservers of eyewitness accounts as well as those taking on the task of reconstructing events for nineteenth-century schoolchildren.

What the colonial period did have to offer the nineteenth century’s self-conscious nationalists were a few heroes like Roger Williams and Benjamin Franklin, ancestors worthy of their descendants, along with some memorable scenes. A deep forgetting fell over the twenty thousand Puritans who came to America to build a city on the hill for the spiritual edification of their European brethren. Instead the appealing picture of several hundred humble Pilgrims sitting down to dinner with Wampanoag Indians in mutual respect and general thanksgiving came to stand in for the whole gallery of disputatious colonists. The colonial period also yielded a wonderful line: “God sifted a whole Nation that he might send choice Grain over into this wilderness.”10 Although it was spoken to honor the Puritan founders, it anticipated a major motif of American selfunderstanding in the first century after independence.





Natural Rights as an Ideology



Like all moral truths, the thrilling affirmation of inalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence involved behavioral entailments. Its high-minded Americanism exacted a price in the form of a collective uneasiness about institutionalized slavery and covetous territorial ambitions. The flagrant contradiction between slavery and the principle of equality led to the nation’s first emancipation movement as one after another of the Northern states abolished slavery in the waning years of the eighteenth century. With these remarkable acts, the old surveyors’ line which Messrs. Mason and Dixon ran between Maryland and Pennsylvania became the symbolic division between freedom and slavery. The nation that sought a unifying doctrine found itself divided along an utterly new axis of labor systems. By freeing themselves from the onus of slavery, Northerners could expatiate on the meaning of freedom, but as this became a significant identifier of national purpose it ominously added ideological momentum to the slow differentiation taking place between North and South.

Ironically it was a slaveholder, Thomas Jefferson, who first envisioned an “empire of liberty” when as president he purchased Louisiana in 1803. The national quality which Jefferson coveted for Americans was not the chaste liberty of eighteenth-century constitution-writers but the robust liberty of assertive go-getters finally free to put their lives in tune with nature’s rhythms. The eighteenth century’s beau ideal of liberty as the corollary of order yielded to the nineteenth century’s liberty as release from custom. Always an enthusiastic expansionist, the young Jefferson had been the major architect of the land policy that eventuated in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Mary Douglas’s injunction about a nation’s controlling the memory of its members comes to mind in contemplating Jefferson’s accomplishment in the Continental Congress. All Americans probably “remember” that slavery was banned in the Northwest Ordinance, but have forgotten—that is, were never taught—that there was also a Southwest Ordinance which opened the deep South to slavery’s spread. One looks in vain for references to the Southwest Ordinance in American history textbooks, but the knowledge of the Northwest Ordinance has been planted in the reconstituted memory of us all.

The West was the screen upon which Jefferson projected his vision of a nation both democratic and enterprising—hostile to privilege and authoritative meddling, supportive of innovative, individual effort. The Declaration could also elevate the significance of America’s Revolution if natural rights were converted into universal aspirations. A born phrasemaker, Jefferson did just this, using striking rhetorical flourishes to sketch a picture of ordinary men working out their destiny as curious, vital, productive, and aspiring human beings. He even turned the Garden of Eden into the seedbed of democratic nationalism: “I would have seen half the world desolated. Were there but an Adam and Eve left in every country and left free, it would be better than it is now.”11

Jefferson pointed Americans, geographically and temporally, toward the West with its promise of a continental future for the United States. We have so long taken for granted this orientation that it comes as something of a surprise to learn that an astute political leader like Alexander Hamilton actually opposed the Louisiana Purchase, declaring it the wisdom of all governments to prevent the dispersion of their people. Behind Hamilton’s dictum lay the belief that only in close-knit communities did men and women learn their place and how to stay in it. Order was achieved by prescription. Fighting against the physical and spiritual immobility of such political prudence, Jefferson considered repressive what Hamilton thought was the common sense of the matter. The fear of disorder, for Jefferson, became an intellectual ruse used to arouse opposition to the exercise of freedom by ordinary folk. He went so far as to incorporate social obligation into men’s natural endowment. “So invariably do the laws of nature create our duties and interest,” he wrote, “that when they seem to be at variance we might suspect some fallacy in our reasoning.”12 Men did not need to stay put and learn their duties from their betters and elders; they knew them intuitively and fulfilled them as they pursued their natural inclinations.

Directing his appeals to the independent family farmer of the North, Jefferson left slavery in a conceptual limbo. It was free men, free land, free institutions, free choice that America stood for and that—historians now began to say—it had been tending toward since the Mayflower Compact. African-American men and women fell afoul of the historical apotheoses of ordinary white men and their families. Children’s schoolbooks taught that Negroes were “a brutish people, having little more of humanity but the form.” Despite the vigor of the abolitionist attack, slaves themselves were condemned by their blackness, the reigning assumption that darkness of skin color accompanied weakness of intellect being routinely inculcated in classroom teaching.13

Without writing histories himself, Jefferson became the font of inspiration for the historical consciousness of the nineteenth century. His role as the prophet of American nationalism is unique. In his declining years, both Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson came to ask his blessing for their competing campaigns for the presidency. A generation after his death, the founders of the Republican Party chose their name in tribute to him, which means that both of the country’s major parties claim him as their founder, even divvying up the label, Democratic Republican, by which Jefferson’s own movement was known. The political philosophy which he expressed in his speeches and letters affirmed both liberty and equality, the grand themes of party platforms and national histories.

The incompatibilities between the liberty and equality that Jefferson extolled generated the tensions of American political life for the next two centuries. Most people experienced these as problems in reality rather than as the two sides of a contradiction lodged deep within their moral traditions. It took an outsider, Alexis de Tocqueville, to see that the equality of condition he found in the United States actually posed a threat to liberty, or at least to the aristocratic ideal of liberty as the expression of courage and excellence. Highly conscious of the invidious comparisons Europeans made between their traditions and the raw spirit of democratic nationalism, Tocqueville embedded his critique of the United States in a fascinating sociological account of how opinion formation, voting, ordinary ambition, and even geographic mobility contributed to the tyranny of the majority in a nation dedicated to freedom.14

For Americans, their history became the history of the progress of normative political and economic institutions. God had sent choice grain into the wilderness, and now there were fruited plains from sea to shining sea. Effortlessly the intentionality of the Almighty merged with the intentionality of all men, that is, if they were left free to choose. Colonial seeds flowered in the universal manhood suffrage, continental expansion, and material abundance of the nineteenth century. Materialism and morality coalesced to create a new imperative for the human species. Although many people—African-Americans, women, Catholics—were excluded from the full promise of this creed, they generally found it more satisfying to attack the hypocrisy of the white male citizenry than to disavow the political principles of those in charge. Indeed, the American creed and the history of its origins became the major resource for dissenters, radicals, and reformers.15

Jefferson’s was an understanding of American history replete with accessible images. Appealing to the sense of worth in the actual pioneers of the trans-Appalachian West (one-third of Americans lived in new communities by 1810), it also stirred the imagination of those in the East who could relive the accomplishments of their forebears. The progressive and selective development of the economy acquired a moral foundation from the footings laid down by intrepid frontier families. Out of this history came a new model of human behavior—actually male behavior—Homo faber, man the doer, whose activities in the world are enlarged by a generous nature. The American moral imagination seized upon the productive ideal, investing the unceasing doing and making of things with transcendent value. Land then became the means for men’s achieving, with womanly assistance, their natural potential. Voluntary cooperation, mutual forbearance, spontaneous order—these were the human possibilities revealed in America. “We can no longer say there is nothing new under the sun,” Jefferson wrote the philosopher Joseph Priestley. “For this whole chapter in the history of man is new. The great extent of our republic is new.”16

Here Jefferson again caught the sentiment that made this account of America so potent in the nineteenth century. An unimportant country of several million people separated by thousands of miles from any major civilization had written itself into the foreground of human destiny. Americans could only transcend their isolation by universalizing and exalting what was peculiar to them—their success in establishing free institutions, their cultivation of the wilderness, their liberation of the ordinary ambitions of ordinary men. What might be construed by Europeans as uninterestingly vulgar was elevated by the Americans’ historical imagination to a new chapter in the history of mankind. The historical narrative which Ramsay, Warren, and Turnbull first wrote and Jefferson came to exemplify focused upon American values to cement a fragile political union and, ironically, created an understanding of American nationalism which impeded historical consciousness. Cruising above this popular and self-congratulatory national history was an account of human purpose that connected the political and economic initiatives of bustling, busy Americans with the epic march of the human species toward social improvement.

It became the grand theme for America’s first major historian, George Bancroft, whose History of the United States, written during the middle decades of the nineteenth century, fully documented how American greatness arose from its citizens’ commitment to democratic virtue.17 Himself a product of the German historical methods championed by Leopold von Ranke, Bancroft introduced both scientific research methods and romantic motifs into American historiography. As a doctoral candidate in Germany, Bancroft had come in contact with the most advanced centers of historical scholarship, but his grander theme was to exalt the American nation by revealing in its history the course of a universal democratic spirit. Enveloping the history of the revolutionary era in a mist of veneration, Bancroft established a patriotic orthodoxy in the 1830s which was often at odds with his legacy of innovative research. After the celebration of American grandeur in his best-selling histories, it became increasingly difficult for Americans to accept more modest portrayals of their past.

Like Jefferson, Bancroft was both an upper- and lowercase democrat, but unlike Jefferson’s, Bancroft’s democratic fervor was laced with a Christian sentimentalism that blurred the lines between religious and political ideals. Bancroft rolled up intuition, sentiment, reason, grace, and a belief in the equal endowments of human beings into an all-purpose force propelling Americans toward their progressive goals. Using natural imagery and appealing to instinctual powers, he described the expansion of the United States across the continent as a kind of democratic folk movement serving both God’s and the nation’s purposes. The individual and the race were simultaneously ennobled by the liberation of the human spirit from the shackles of poverty, superstition, and tyranny, in Bancroft’s account. A contemporary of Charles Darwin, Bancroft published his last three volumes during the same years that The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man appeared, but there was no trace in them of the mordant spirit of Darwin’s evolutionary theories, with its presentation of nature “red in tooth and claw.” Rather Bancroft’s blend of religion and rationalism embellished his romantic notions of historical causation. Powerful as a stimulus of national loyalty, Bancroft’s History helped insulate the nation’s past, particularly the nation-building acts of the Revolution and Constitution, from scholarly scrutiny, despite his role in bringing German training in critical scholarship to the United States.

Like most educated Americans, Bancroft felt keenly the disparity between the achievements of America and those of Europe. In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, expectations were high that the free institutions of America would promote excellence in literature, science, and scholarship. Indeed, nationalist fervor had been nourished by fantasies of American greatness in the areas marked out by the high civilization of metropolitan Europe. As these expectations were confounded by reality, many Americans began to define their country by its actual political liberties and economic advances rather than its anticipated cultural contributions. Bancroft had insinuated that European accomplishments were the product of an overripe society, thus maintaining the credibility of the United States as the standard-bearer of the human race. By Bancroft’s time—two generations after the Revolution—an invidious comparison with Europe had become a staple of patriotic prose, which had the effect of subtly linking the world of letters and arts to decadence.

Far from telling a straightforward story, early-nineteenth-century historians explained to Americans why their nation was both unique and a model for the world. More ominously, their emphasis upon progress provided the rationale for displacing the Shawnees, Cherokees, Seminoles, Creeks, and Choctaws whose ancestral lands lay astride the settlers’ path. William Henry Harrison, a military hero and territorial governor destined to become president of the United States in 1840, conveyed this sentiment well with a rhetorical question posed to the Indiana territorial legislature in 1809: “Is one of the fairest portions of the globe to remain in a state of nature, the haunt of a few wretched savages, when it seems destined by the Creator to give support to a large population, and to be the seat of civilization, of science and true religion?”18 Here was an inexorability beyond human agency; Americans’ move across the continent could be construed as nothing more than the workings out of human progress, a thought so congenial to them that they readily accepted their conquest of northern Mexico as a “manifest destiny.”

Expressed by significant participants like Harrison, this sense of a grand design in American affairs drew distantly on the old Puritan ideal of building a city upon the hill for all to imitate, but its immediate inspiration came from the more recent claim that the United States was the flagship of democracy. The democratization of American politics was effected by the efforts of ordinary citizens, whose exertions in the electoral campaigns of Jefferson and his two successors, James Madison and James Monroe, led to their celebration as humble foot soldiers in the war against aristocratic pride and privilege. When they improved their worldly standing, commentators interpreted their rise as proof of the naturalness of social mobility. In what has proved to be an enduring association, democracy and prosperity were linked together, both construed as the natural entitlement of independent men.

American writers made the settler families of the land west of the Appalachian Mountains the carriers of a new and vibrantly democratic civilization. They were never depicted as invaders even though blood was always spilled in violent contestation with the Indians before any territory was opened up for settler occupation. The iconography and literature of the westward movement instead evoked a peaceful tableau in which the sunburned and hardy pioneer father walked beside his Conestoga wagon, Bible in his hand, his rifle at the ready should any hostile force attempt to repel his “castle on wheels.” The history of these migrations served both American democracy and American nationalism, the former by celebrating the courage and fortitude of ordinary white citizens and the latter by justifying the seizure of territory long occupied by native Americans.

The histories of the nineteenth century had discursively woven together a nation of strangers and newcomers, but the price to be paid for this national fabric was the suppression of cultural differences. The reigning metaphor for the nationalizing process was the melting pot—compulsory mixing at high temperatures. (No one ever suggested the colorful patchwork quilt, seamed into a whole.) The descriptions of self-sufficient men and women sending down roots in virgin soil and sprouting the towns that would nurture Harrison’s “civilization, science and true religion” stirred the imagination. Whether operating as a theoretical safety valve or reflecting the actual opportunity to purchase homesteads, the idea of a vast continent inviting the simple exertions of house raisings and land clearing elicited nearly as much loyalty as the accessible land itself. Moreover, depicting American history as the repeated new beginnings of an industrious people provided a picture compelling enough to eclipse the memory of the uprooted Africans brought across the Atlantic in leg irons or of bedraggled and reluctant immigrants cast out of their European homes.





Frederick Jackson Turner’s Frontier Thesis



The nation’s material and social advances were actually counted every ten years from 1790 when the census was taken. Each decade the agricultural output increased and the size of manufacturing establishments became larger and more complex. Every census confirmed the remarkable increase of population and cleared land and fortified Americans’ predisposition to turn statistical measures into confirmation of a grand design. Every ten years the census report also pointed out the location of the frontier line inching westward across the map of North America. The acquisition of California and the opening of the Oregon Trail in midcentury made it possible for settlers to pass through the semiarid lands of the Far West and head for the Pacific Coast. The decadal westward creep of the frontier line bounced to the coast. Charged with indicating the frontier line, the superintendent of the U.S. Census in 1890 looked at the scattered settlements, threw up his hands in despair, and declared that the frontier era had come to an end.

This cartographical decision from the census head prompted one historian, Frederick Jackson Turner, to reflect upon the significance that the frontier had played in the American past. Writing at a time when his fellow citizens were coming to terms with their new situation as members of an industrial nation, Turner wrote a history of the frontier which ministered to people’s nostalgia about a simpler era. He also defined as American those democratic and egalitarian values which justified the bloodletting of the Civil War just a generation earlier. To the frontier, Turner said, America owed not only its consolidation as a nation but its characteristic intellectual traits—and he went on to catalogue them: “coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind…that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless, nervous energy, that dominant individualism with the buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom.”19 Following Bancroft’s romantic invention of the American people as the collective agents of change, Turner anthropomorphized the whole nation by converting it into a single individual—not even an individual really, but a type—standing in for the country as a whole.

The shared American understanding that history told the story of progress helped Turner dispose of the Indians, whose presence on the frontier could not be neglected entirely. Without being hostile or deprecatory toward the indigenous population, Turner suggested a reason for its disappearance which removed all moral responsibility for the many violent acts that had swept the Indians from the path of the settlers. He began by professing to be at a loss to explain why the trading stage of frontier life had yielded so quickly to the advancing column of pioneer families and then handed the topic over to theorists: “In this progress from savage conditions lie topics for the evolutionist.” Next the Indian presence was saluted as a consolidating agent; their contribution to America, Turner wrote, was as “a common danger, demanding united action.” Still twelve lines further the Indians figure even more obliquely in passages stressing the importance of the frontier as a military training school, “keeping alive the power of resistance to aggression.”20 Reflecting a kind of Darwinian resignation in the face of processes now deemed inexorable, Turner attributed the ejection of successive Native American tribes to natural forces. In the space of one page, he used evolutionary theory to explain the eradication of the indigenous peoples and then evoked their presence to demonstrate the frontier contribution to American unity, only to conclude by reversing the moral stance of settlers and Indians by claiming that the endemic warfare on the frontier prepared Americans to resist aggression!





Capitalism, the Constitution, and American History



At the very time that Turner was writing to celebrate the moving frontier that had spread family farms across the North American continent, farming itself had become an increasingly precarious way of life. As farm incomes plummeted, most young men and women from rural America had to seek their fortunes in the newly sprouted factory towns. But frontier farms, in Turner’s assessment, had produced something more important than crop yields; they had fostered American character traits. So while those who clung to their farms were battered by declining prices, tight credit, and rising freight costs, the frontier heritage of independence, productivity, and initiative furnished a spiritual link between America’s agrarian past and its industrial future. Despite his celebration of an era that had come to an end, Turner’s message about Americans’ “inventive turn of mind” and “masterful grasp of material things” spoke directly to his contemporaries, in part because these qualities were deemed so important to the entrepreneurship that was reshaping the United States into a powerful industrial nation. Far removed from steel-fabricating plants and bituminous coal mines, Turner’s history of the frontier nonetheless provided distinctive American roots for the capitalist economy which had emerged to dominate national life.

In the early years of the twentieth century, scholars introduced the notion of capitalism into the history of the American nation, and then in a highly unflattering way. The debased living conditions in factory towns had called forth a fresh generation of reformers who aroused the nation’s concern about the widening gulf between the new industrial plutocrats and their overworked, underpaid workers. Capitalism thus entered American historiography as part of a polemic. Only recently has the word shed some of its negative associations because of the collapse of the Soviet regime. Although strictly speaking a reference to a specific economic system, the word tends to direct attention to one aspect of the system, the economic power in capital itself. Since such a concentration of power is at odds with democratic values, Americans have maintained an ambivalent attitude toward capitalism. Far different is what might be called the subliminal culture of capitalism—those images of individual fortitude, prosperity, agricultural abundance, open opportunity, hard work, free choice, inventive genius, and productive know-how. As Turner’s work suggests, the culture of capitalism has thoroughly permeated the nation’s historical consciousness. More to the point, this self-understanding which history has furnished Americans has played a critical role in promoting actual capitalist development.

At first sight the American economy seems to be straightforwardly driven by the dynamics of market production, mediated only by the private decisions of property owners. In other words, capitalism seems confined to impersonal processes and personal events. This view is tenable, however, only if one assumes that human beings naturally know how to work and save, take risks, make wise choices about resources, and adapt to constant innovation and change. But in fact it is culture that furnishes models of behavior and distributes honor and shame to indicate the appropriateness of individual actions. In a market economy, dependent upon voluntary efforts, the cultural element is critical, because it is through explicit social values that people are given the personal ambition and essential knowledge to keep the system going.

Thoroughly privatized, the American economy only moves in response to personal initiatives to invest in productive enterprises, to mobilize resources for work, and to save or spend according to individual dictates. Because decisions like these are guided by deeply internalized values, our culture acts as the invisible engine driving the free market. Particularly important to this culture of capitalism have been the meanings and values Americans have invested in their history, their laws, and their literature. As recently as twenty years ago, social scientists would have denied the centrality to the economy of anything as elusive as culture, but the experiences in Eastern Europe have forcefully demonstrated how important popular understandings are to the workings of an economy. The cultural models that sustain the American economy were long ago insinuated into the nation’s history books and through them into the consciousness of the people. American children learn their most basic economic truths through stories, sermons, movies, and the adult injunctions that follow them from home to school and school to community. History texts have provided American children with exemplary models of trailblazing initiatives, disciplined efforts, and individual sacrifices for progress. Beginning with the accounts of nation-building in the revolutionary era, national history has imparted the kinds of moral lessons that have enabled capitalism to flourish, but like the roots of a plant this vital cultural sustenance is hard to see.

One of the distinguishing features of a free-enterprise economy is that its coercion is veiled. This is an absolutism that works without visible constraints. The apparently voluntary nature of commercial transactions creates the illusion that participants are free to choose. The fact that people must earn before they can eat is a commonly recognized connection between need and work, but it presents itself as a natural link embedded in the necessity of eating rather than as arising from a particular arrangement for distributing food through market exchanges. Despite the fact that men and women must buy and sell in order to live, the optional aspects of the market remain most salient. It is the individual who makes choices, takes risks, and suffers or enjoys the consequences. Presented as natural and personal in the stories people tell about themselves, the social and compulsory aspects of capitalism slip out of sight and out of mind. Yet learning to participate in American economic life requires years of preparation, not only in acquiring skills, but also in creating that self-possessed individual who accepts as just the outcomes of market transactions. Far from being natural, the cues for market participation are given through complicated social codes. Indeed, the illusion that compliance in the dominant economic system is voluntary is itself an amazing cultural artifact.

Americans came to think of their economic responses as natural largely because of the way their history was framed. Already well established in colonial America, the mores of the market economy—the cultivation of enterprise, the receptivity to innovation, the alertness to market signals—acquired political overtones when they were connected to the story of personal liberty. Linked to a national destiny to turn the American wilderness into a “fruited plain,” economic liberty became one of the principal elements of American self-understanding. Indeed, the market—conceived abstractly—suggested a better solution to the venerable problem of order. Its capacity to enlist people in productive activities offered an alternative to the overt social direction of magistrates and ministers. In the presumed naturalness of self-interest lay the key for considering the market economy—in fact, a very sophisticated social arrangement—as a natural system whose principles, like the laws of gravity, could be uncovered by scientific research.

Political philosophy had long discussed the human predicament of having to invest power in government in order to secure order, but then having to live in fear of the disordering possibility of the government’s abuse of that power. The conventional American understanding of this conundrum was that men (and it was a male concept) yearned for freedom, particularly the freedom to look out for themselves, but that they also used and abused other men’s freedom in the pursuit of their own. Only liberty and competition—in both the political and economic realms—could accommodate the needs and nature of the self-willed individuals who formed civil society. Thus the imperative that connects economic and political freedom is assumed to be rooted in the structure of the human personality. The status of these assertions as hypotheses disappeared in a historical record that treated them as facts. And Americans continued to look at the past for evidence that the natural principles of society were working themselves out in the time and space that belonged to the United States.

A key component of this understanding of political and economic freedom was the presentation of the United States Constitution in history texts. Before the Civil War, the Constitution had been a bone of contention between the Northern and Southern states. Northerners, following John Marshall’s lead, wished to consider the Constitution in Hegelian terms, as a particular manifestation of eternal principles of justice. Southerners resisted this interpretation as part of their general rejection of the concept of nationhood, preferring to see the union as a contract freely entered into by the diverse states. Central to the South’s defense against antislavery reformers was the claim that the Constitution was a dissolvable compact. So successful was the South in using the Constitution to prevent interference that abolitionist leaders publicly burned copies of the Constitution to dramatize their commitment to a higher law.

Among the many fruits of victory that the North garnered in 1865 was the opportunity at last to depict the United States Constitution as the organic law of the land, understood both as a sublime expression of popular sovereignty and the embodiment of true principles of civil order. Without further jurisprudential challenge from the South, Northern scholars after the Civil War fashioned a history that linked the Constitution to ancient concepts of justice and traced its transplanting from Teutonic forests and heroic English documents to the Mayflower Compact and New England town meetings.

After the Civil War, historians were also able to tie the intentions of the Founding Fathers to the actual emergence of the nation as a mighty industrial power. In this interpretation, the Constitution became the embodiment of natural law because of its protection of life, liberty, and property. No longer obliged to consider Southern constitutional thinking with its emphasis upon the contractual nature of the union, Northern jurists and scholars were free to elevate the Constitution far above statute law. An invidious comparison between the “Supreme Law of the Land” and the laws of elected legislators gave a peculiar twist to American democracy. Historians presented the Constitution as an inviolable fundamental law. Its framing and ratification elicited reverential encomiums to popular sovereignty, while the daily practice of democratic power by the president and Congress acquired the odium of vulgar politics, conducted largely for the benefit of politicans. Democracy came to be associated with the capacity of equally enfranchised ordinary white men to ward off government intrusions. Citizen action in the pursuit of common goals lost whatever glory its association with democracy had provided because the activities themselves had been deflated to mere politics.

Behind these representations of political institutions lay the model of the market understood as a nexus of voluntary associations limited only by the demands of open access. Because American history stressed that liberation from oppressive authorities of all kinds would lift the dead hand of the past to the benefit of humanity, nature, and progress, the Constitution was glorified as the guardian of that liberation. In the decades bracketing the turn of the nineteenth century, this Northern interpretation of the Constitution aroused the ire of a new group of critics, the Progressives. When interpreted as prescient because it anticipated America’s industrial future and sublime because it embodied eternal principles of justice, the Constitution could be used to block new social policies like those enunciated in state laws protecting working women and children from the worst perils of the factory system.

The British historian Lewis Namier once commented that the Enlightenment was dead everywhere except the United States. In this observation, Namier turned the Enlightenment into a shorthand reference to a cluster of powerful ideas that came to dominance at the end of the eighteenth century: faith in progress, commitment to free inquiry, belief in the rational capacities of man, tolerance of religious diversity, respect for individualism, and insistence upon equality of rights. When the American colonists plunged into unexpected conflict with Great Britain, they found in the Enlightenment reconfiguration of political order a justification first for prosecuting their rebellion and second for declaring themselves an independent nation. By taking as their motto Novus ordo seculorum—a new order for the ages—Americans were paradoxically forming an enduring alliance with a troubled European reform tradition. The American example made the goals of Europe’s radicals appear realizable just as their admiration for the new nation turned the American Revolution into an epochal event in world history. In subsequent generations what had been fluid and immanent in these expectations of progress froze into the conviction that the United States was the embodiment of reform ambitions. The Enlightenment lived on in the United States, as Namier noted, because it provided the philosophical womb for American nationhood, itself now at risk from just the kind of revolutionary thinking that had originally inspired it.

The United States could serve as an ideal for humanity only if human aspirations were funneled into the vessel labeled “autonomous, hardworking, self-reliant man.” Here becomes apparent the troubling contradiction in a history which glorified freedom and went on to assert that the only thing people were free to do was engage in relentless self-improvement. Through all these years while schoolchildren learned to celebrate their country’s undoubted achievements, they were conditioned to accept unquestioningly the implicit values of individual responsibility and decision-making. They were also taught to think within a cultural frame of reference that was predominantly male in gender, white in color, and Protestant in religious orientation. Making, doing, building, increasing, growing—these were compulsory virtues.

At the center, then, of American history was an undersocialized, individualistic concept of human nature set in an overdetermined story of progress. Deeply etched into the collective imagination, this history distributed social merit and public attention—and through them political authority. Shoring up the frail unity of thirteen rebelling colonies, it assumed the absolutist character of a mythic tale of origins for a mighty industrial nation. In time its imperviousness to change stifled curiosity about America’s past because it could not explain the real problems of living people: the turbulence of the Civil War, the dislocations of immigration, the source of imperial ambition, and the reconfiguration of the American economy. Vibrant processes—totally alien to the world of the Founding Fathers—were rapidly transforming the country into a modern industrial giant, and as they did so, the first generation of twentieth-century Americans began searching for new interpretations of their national past, their capacity for critical thought stirred by the modern absolutisms generated by science, social theory, and nationalism.
