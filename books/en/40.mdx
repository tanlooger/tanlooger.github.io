Leaves the Press Breathless!

"A thrilling page-turner... compelling...

Sheldon's fans will stay awake to discover

If Tomorrow Comes for Tracy Whitney."

---Detroit Free Press

"Smooth-flowing and exciting."

---Associated Press

"Won't disappoint his fans. If Tomorrow Comes is

sexy and alluring, seducing readers through the

guise of a beautiful heroine who lives on the

cutting edge of danger.... Sheldon has a habit

of both charming and shocking his readers. He

does both with aplomb in If Tomorrow Comes."

--United Press International

"Tracy Whitney is the latest and perhaps the

ultimate Sheldon heroine."

---Denver Post

"Romance, suspense and evil. If Tomorrow

Comes has all that and more. This is good reading

that will leave you with a tingle of excitement

and a smile of admiration."

---Richmond Times

"An engrossing read."

---Indianapolis Star

"If you want an adventure novel you simply

cannot put down, go to Sheldon."

---New York Daily News
