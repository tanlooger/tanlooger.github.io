I’d like to gratefully acknowledge the help of three medical people who helped me with the factual material in this book. They are:

Russ Dorr, P.A.

Florence Dorr, R.N.

Janet Ordway, M.D. and Doctor of Psychiatry

As always, they helped with the things you don’t notice. If you see a glaring error, it’s mine.

There is, of course, no such drug as Novril, but there are several codeine-based drugs similar to it, and, unfortunately, hospital pharmacies and medical practice dispensaries are sometimes lax in keeping such drugs under tight lock and close inventory.

The places and characters in this book are fictional.
