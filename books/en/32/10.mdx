title: Chapter 10 Why Backtracking Is Good
---

GOLDILOCKS MARCHED INTO the classroom exactly on time. The Big Bad Wolf ambled in after her. There weren’t many seats left, but Goldilocks found one midway back. The Big Bad Wolf took one in the very back row.

Baby Bear stood in front, grinning at both of them. “Do I dare ask how lunch went?”

“The ribs were great,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Pork ribs. Big and juicy and as rare as the chef could—”

“Make him stop!” shouted Little Pig. “Wolf, you just watch yourself, or you’ll be going back to the penitentiary!”

The Big Bad Wolf showed his teeth and growled fiercely. “Might I invite you to dinner this evening? If you bring some fava beans and a nice Chianti—”

“Enough, both of you!” said Baby Bear. “Goldilocks, did you have a productive meeting with the Big Bad Wolf? You seemed a little unsure whether those changes to your villain were going to work out.”

“My villain’s fine,” Goldilocks said in her huffiest voice.

“Yup, brilliantissimo,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “I’m already thinking of editors I know who are going to love her story.”

Baby Bear’s eyes shunted from Goldilocks to the Big Bad Wolf and then back again. “Is something wrong, Goldilocks? It sounds like you’ve got a pretty strong vote of confidence from the Big Bad Wolf.”

“I told you, I’m fine.” Goldilocks crossed her arms on her chest and scowled at him.

“You don’t look fine. You look upset about something.”

Goldilocks could not believe he was being so obtuse. “You promised to teach us how to Snowflake our novels.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. You’ve now made it through the first five steps, and you’re doing great.”

“Spectacular,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Super. Mondo. Groovy.”

“I am not doing great,” said Goldilocks. “Just before lunch, in case you didn’t notice, I made some huge changes to my villain, and now my whole story needs fixing. How is that great? I’m going to have to redo everything.”

Baby Bear shrugged. “I suppose that might seem like a problem. But it’s a good problem, and I was just going to teach on why backtracking is essential. Let’s take a little inventory, shall we? You’ve completed five steps of the Snowflake Method. How long will it take you to change step 1, which was your one-sentence summary?”

Goldilocks flipped open her laptop. “Um, actually, that one won’t need any changing. It’s … fine as it is.”

Baby Bear nodded. “That’s what I thought, but just wanted to check. I recommend that my students constantly try to improve their one-sentence summary. What about step 2, your one-paragraph summary? Obviously, that was going to need some changing after you reworked your villain. How long will that take to fix up?”

“She did that at lunch,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “You people ought to hear it now. It’s awesomely better. Goldilocks redid it in about five minutes while we were talking. Man, this story really zings. Looks like we might have a shot at redemption for this villain.”

“Redemption—pffffft!” said Little Pig. “Once a villain, always a villain.”

Mrs. Hubbard shook a long, bony finger at Little Pig. “Nonsense, young pig! People can change. Even wolves can change. But what never changes is when you’ve got an empty cupboard.”

Baby Bear was rocking back and forth on his heels. “It sounds like Goldilocks is upset about having to rework this step of the Snowflake. She spent five minutes revising her one-paragraph summary.” He went to the whiteboard and wrote down, FIVE MINUTES.

Little Pig bunched his long pink snout into a sneer. “But her character sheets in step 3 are a lost cause. She spent hours on those last night, and now all that effort is a sunk cost.”

Goldilocks opened the document with her character sheets and scanned down the page. “Um, I guess they’re not all wrong. The one for Elise won’t change at all, except I need to rewrite the one-paragraph summary for her personal story. But it’s the same as the one-paragraph summary for the novel, so I’ll just need to paste that in.”

“And then there’s Dirk,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “I imagine that’ll take you days and weeks to change.”

Goldilocks looked at her character sheet for Dirk. Nothing really needed changing except his one-paragraph summary, and she could see that it was going to be very similar to the changes she’d made for Elise. “I think it’ll only take me a few minutes to change that one.”

“Oh, well, there’s Monique!” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Hours and days to change that!”

Goldilocks shook her head. “No, it’ll take only a few minutes for her. The real problem is going to be Henri’s one-paragraph summary. That’s going to change like crazy.”

Baby Bear shrugged. “I suppose that happens sometimes. Read us what you had already written for Henri.”

Goldilocks scrolled down.

The entry for Henri was completely blank.

Her face suddenly felt very hot. “Oh, my!”

The Big Bad Wolf came over to look at her screen. He sat back on his haunches and began howling with laughter. He laughed so hard, he fell over and lay on the floor, clutching his stomach and shaking.

Goldilocks wanted to die of embarrassment. “Actually, it looks like I didn’t do anything on step 3 for Henri, other than write his name.”

Baby Bear nodded. “I thought I remembered his part being a little thin. I seem to recall that you didn’t like him much, because he was such a mean, nasty, evil, wicked—”

“Don’t say things like that about Henri!” Goldilocks shouted. “He had a terrible childhood, and there are reasons he turned out the way he did.”

“—gangster-serving, selfish, greedy, grasping, woman-chasing, pigheaded—”

“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Little Pig.

“—rascally, Nazi-collaborating scoundrel,” said Baby Bear. “So you didn’t bother to write anything about him, because he’s just a villain.”

Goldilocks hung her head. “Well, I was wrong, so I suppose I need to backtrack and write up something for him in step 3.”

“I suppose you do,” said Baby Bear. “How much time extra is that going to cost you?”

“Well … not any extra time, because I never did it in the first place,” Goldilocks said. “But if your Snowflake Method was any good, it would have forced me to do it before I moved on. Now I have to backtrack.”

“There’s nothing wrong with backtracking,” Baby Bear said. “It’s essential, in fact. All writers backtrack. It’s just a matter of how much they have to backtrack.”

The Big Bad Wolf had finished laughing. He got up and returned to his seat. “You want to hear a horror story?” he said. “I had an author last year who got his revision letter from his editor, and it basically had only two words: ‘Start over.’”

“Ouch! Start over?” Baby Bear shook his head sadly.

“What’s a revision letter?” asked Goldilocks.

“After you sell your novel, you’ll spend some time polishing it until it’s as perfect as you can make it,” Baby Bear said. “Then you send it to your publisher. They assign it to an editor, who reads it carefully, makes notes, and writes a revision letter telling you what’s working well in the story and what’s broken. The letter doesn’t tell you how to fix it. That’s not the editor’s job. She’s there to point out the major problems. Your job, after you get the revision letter, is to rewrite your manuscript.”

“Actually, the author’s job is more complicated than that,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “When an author gets a revision letter, she’s required by law to call her agent and complain bitterly about her mean, nasty, cruel editor who has bacon for brains. She whines and moans and complains for three hours. If she’s the emotional sort, she cries big buckets of tears. If she’s the unemotional sort, she makes secret plans to send her editor a letter bomb. Then her wise and brilliant agent talks her off the ledge, reminds her that she signed a binding legal contract, and suggests that maybe her editor might have said one or two non-moronic things in the revision letter.”

“And eventually, when the author’s sanity returns, she rewrites her manuscript,” said Baby Bear.

“So, what’s your point?” said Goldilocks. “What does this have to do with backtracking?”

“Rewriting your manuscript is backtracking,” said Baby Bear. “Rewriting it all completely from scratch is the worst form of backtracking.”

“I only see that with my seat-of-the-pants writers,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Yeah, sure, sometimes they nail their first draft, but sometimes, hoo-boy, they turn in the most wretched drivel you ever heard of. And they always think it’s brilliant.”

“The point here,” said Baby Bear, “is that when you have to backtrack on a full manuscript, you’re looking at six months of hard labor.”

“And the publisher gives you one month to do it,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Loads of fun!”

“You said all writers have to backtrack,” said Goldilocks. “Does that mean outliners and Snowflakers do too?”

“Of course,” said Baby Bear. “When an outliner backtracks, he has to revise his outline. If that’s a hundred pages, he does a hundred pages of revision. That’s better than rewriting a four-hundred-page manuscript, but it’s still a lot of work.”

“But … Snowflakers have to backtrack too?” Goldilocks said, determined to make Baby Bear admit the point.

“Of course!” said Baby Bear. “That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. Everybody backtracks. You’ll never get it perfect on the first round. During the ten steps of the Snowflake, I encourage writers to backtrack after every single step if they need to.”

“That sounds dreadful!” Goldilocks cried.

“Not if it’s only five or ten minutes of work,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Which is what you’re looking at here, Blondie. And since you didn’t do the work in the first place, technically, it isn’t even backtracking. You’re just doing the steps out of order.”

“Oh,” Goldilocks said in a very small voice.

“Backtracking is good,” said Baby Bear. “It makes your story stronger, deeper, richer. The reason Snowflakers love the Snowflake Method is because they do a lot of their backtracking early, on small pieces of work. Which means that they don’t have to do much backtracking later, when it’s ballooned out to a four-hundred-page manuscript. It’s a lot easier to revise a one-page synopsis than a whole novel.”

Goldilocks opened up her one-page synopsis to see how much she had to change. She had only written the first two paragraphs of that synopsis, and it turned out she only needed to change the last sentence of the second paragraph—the sentence where Elise killed Henri and buried him in the garden.

“So, Goldilocks,” Baby Bear said. “Can you give us an estimate of how much time it’s going to cost you to backtrack?”

Goldilocks didn’t say anything.

“Hours?” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Days? Weeks?”

“About … ten minutes,” Goldilocks said.

Baby Bear smiled. “Well, then.”

“No way!” said the young man next to Goldilocks. “I didn’t sign up to learn how to keep chewing over the same piece of gum a thousand times. I’m out of here.” He grabbed his backpack and shambled out of the room.

Baby Bear’s mouth dropped open. “Is there anyone else who thinks this is too hard and wants to leave?”

Goldilocks thought it was horribly rude to walk out in the middle of a workshop.

But one by one, half a dozen other writers quietly grabbed their things and walked out.

Little Pig raised his hoof. “Can we get on with it? The reason people are abandoning you is because you’re telling us things we don’t want to hear. Nobody wants to be told that writing fiction is an endless round of revisions. Young bear, you’d better work just a bit harder at making writing interesting, or you’re going to see more defections.”

Baby Bear looked at his watch. “We actually only have about two minutes left before this workshop ends. And the next item on the schedule is the keynote address in the main auditorium. So your homework for tonight is to look back over your first five steps of the Snowflake and fix up anything that needs reworking. Finish your one-page synopsis, and then write up half a page to a full page on each of your characters. I want you to really get inside their skins. Explore their backstory. Figure out what makes them tick. Tomorrow, we’ll—”

The bell rang.

Instantly, about half the students jumped up and grabbed their things and hurried for the door. The other half had been taking notes, and they took longer to leave.

Goldilocks felt horrible for Baby Bear. He must feel very discouraged to see so many of his students who didn’t seem interested in what he was teaching. She followed him out of the classroom and down the hall.

He ducked inside the men’s room.

Goldilocks didn’t want to look like a stalker, so she kept walking toward the auditorium. But she wasn’t much interested in hearing the keynote speaker.

She walked outside of the main building toward the coffee shop. She thought she heard voices from the back patio, so she peered around the shrubbery that blocked it off from sight.

The Big Bad Wolf was sitting at a table in the far corner drinking a large coffee.

Little Pig was pacing back and forth in front of him, arguing.

Goldilocks couldn’t hear what he was saying, but Little Pig’s face was very pink.

The Big Bad Wolf looked extremely angry.

Goldilocks didn’t want to get involved, so she backed away and scurried to the parking lot and drove home, thinking about her story.

That evening, after the children were put to bed, she stayed up late going over everything she had done so far. She revised the one-paragraph summaries for each of the main characters. She finished her one-page synopsis. And she wrote up a full page on the backstory and motivations of each of her characters.

By the time she finished, it was very late. A little voice in her head told her that she shouldn’t put so much work into these early parts. After all, she would only come back and revise them later. But she had a hunch that the better job she did in the early steps, the less work she’d have in the later ones.

Tomorrow, she would talk to the Big Bad Wolf again and ask him just how interested he was in having her as a client. She thought he might be a very good agent to work with.

An agent with sharp teeth to show to the world, but a soft and kind heart inside.
