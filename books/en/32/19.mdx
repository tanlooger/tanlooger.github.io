title: Chapter 19 Summary of the Snowflake Method
---

HERE ARE THE ten steps of the Snowflake Method.

The main purpose of these steps is to help you write your first draft. (When you’re editing your story, you may also find these steps useful in helping you restructure your story and deepen your characters. But that’s a secondary purpose.)

If you find that some of these steps aren’t useful to you, then don’t do them. You’ll quickly learn which steps are most valuable to you. Focus on those. And if there are other steps that you find valuable, add them to your list. Your goal is to get a strong first draft. These steps are guidelines to get you there—they are not unbreakable rules.

After each step, you may want to revisit your earlier steps and revise your work. The earlier you make revisions, the better. The power of the Snowflake Method comes from helping you do many revisions early.





First Things First

Before you do any of these steps, you should know what category of novel you’re writing and you should know who your target audience is. Your goal as a novelist is to delight your target audience.

Defining your target audience means deciding exactly what kind of story you want to write. Then your target audience is the set of people who would be delighted by that kind of story. You may be in your own target audience. If you aren’t, it may help to visualize one typical person in that audience.

Answer these questions in writing:

My category is: ___________

This is the kind of story I want to write: ___________

This kind of story will delight my target audience because: ___________





Step 1: Write a One-Sentence Summary

Give yourself one hour to write a single sentence that summarizes your novel. Make it less than twenty-five words if you possibly can. Focus on one or two characters and tell their story goal. Don’t give away the ending.

The one-sentence summary is a marketing tool that you use to arouse curiosity. Shorter is better, because you want to memorize this sentence. Then, when somebody asks what your book is about, you can spiel it out without having to think.

The purpose of the one-sentence summary is to help people instantly know whether they are in your target audience.

If they are, then they’ll say, “Tell me more!”

If they aren’t, then they’ll say, “My, look at the time!” and change the subject.

Your one-sentence summary also gives your fans a simple way to explain your book to their friends. So it’s a key element of your word-of-mouth campaign.





Step 2: Write a One-Paragraph Summary

Give yourself one hour to expand your one-sentence summary to a full paragraph of five sentences, organized like this:





Explain the setting and the story backdrop and introduce one or two lead characters.

Summarize Act 1, ending with your first disaster. This disaster forces your lead character to commit to the story.

Summarize the first half of Act 2, ending with your second disaster. This disaster causes your lead character to change his thinking from a false Moral Premise to a true one. As a result, your lead character commits to a new way of thinking and acting for the second half of the story.

Summarize the second half of Act 2, ending with your third disaster. This disaster causes your lead character (and your villain, if you have one) to commit to ending the story.

Summarize Act 3, in which you lead up to a final showdown where the lead character either succeeds or fails. You then resolve the story with a happy ending, sad ending, or bittersweet ending.





The purpose of the one-paragraph summary is to ensure that your story has a sound Three-Act Structure, with three strong disasters and a clear Moral Premise.

You will reveal your one-paragraph summary to your agent and editor, but don’t reveal it to your potential readers! Your agent and editor need you to tell them how your story ends, but your readers want you to surprise them.





Step 3: Write a Summary Sheet for Each Character

For each of your important characters, take up to an hour to produce a summary sheet that tells the essentials. Here are the things you need to know:





Role: (Hero, heroine, villain, mentor, sidekick, friend, etc.)

Name: The name of the character.

Goal: The concrete goal of the character for this story.

Ambition: The abstract ambition of the character.

Values: Several sentences that begin, “Nothing is more important than …”

Conflict: What keeps this character from achieving his goal?

Epiphany: What will this character learn by the end of the story?

One-sentence summary: A one-sentence summary of this character’s personal story. (Your novel is the personal story of the lead character. All the other characters are the lead characters of their own personal stories.)

One-paragraph summary: A one-paragraph summary of the Three-Act Structure of this character’s personal story.





You’ll find that not all of these make sense for all your characters. Often, the villain has no epiphany. Some characters are too minor to need a one-sentence summary or a one-paragraph summary. Don’t feel obligated to fill in everything for all characters.





Step 4: Write a Short One-Page Synopsis

Give yourself one hour to expand your one-paragraph summary into a full page. Do this by expanding each sentence in that paragraph to a full paragraph of its own.

If you go slightly over a page, that’s fine. This one-page synopsis is solely for your benefit. You will never need to show it to anyone. Its purpose is to help you start filling in the details in your story.

People sometimes ask if the one-page synopsis should be single-spaced or double-spaced.

This synopsis is for your benefit, so make it single-spaced. That gives you about five hundred words, which is about right. If you want to double-space it for readability, then you’ll probably go over a page, but nobody’s going to be grading you for page count, so don’t worry.





Step 5: Write a Character Synopsis for Each Character

Give yourself an hour for each character and write up their backstory, along with their role in the main story. Usually, half a page to a page is about right. Explain why that character is the way they are, what they want out of life, and anything else that you find interesting. Explain how they fit into the story.

These character synopses are for your benefit. They help you to empathize with each character. Give special attention to the villain, since he usually gets shortchanged. Try to get inside his skin.

If you do a good job on these, you may someday put them in a proposal. Editors love these! Editors love great fiction, and great fiction is built on strong characters.

Very few writers ever put character synopses in their proposals. This is a shame, because these are usually much more interesting than the plot synopsis, which is required in a proposal.





Step 6: Write a Long Four-Page Synopsis

Give yourself two hours to expand your one-page synopsis into about four to five pages. Just take each paragraph from the one-page synopsis and expand it out to a page.

This four-page synopsis is for your benefit alone. You don’t ever have to show it to anyone. Its purpose is to help you flesh out more details in your story.

People often ask how this is related to the synopsis that you must include with a proposal. That synopsis should be a bit shorter—generally two pages minimum and four pages maximum.

I recommend that you write your four-page synopsis first and then cut it down a bit to create your proposal synopsis. Yes, this takes more work, but each of these synopses has a special purpose.





Step 7: Write a Character Bible for Each Character

Take several hours per character and drill deep into them by creating a character bible for each one. This is where you will save all the details about your characters. Here are the sorts of things I usually include in my character bibles:





Physical information: Name, age, birthdate, height, weight, ethnic heritage, color of hair and eyes, physical description, and style of dressing.

Personality information: Sense of humor, personality type, religion, political party, hobbies, favorite music and books and movies, favorite color, and the contents of his wallet or her purse.

Environmental information: Description of home, education, work experience, family, best friend, male friends, female friends, and enemies.

Psychological information: Best and worst childhood memories, a one-line characterization, the strongest and weakest character traits, the character’s paradox, their greatest hope and greatest fear, their philosophy of life, how the character sees himself, and how others see the character.





If you look online, there are many long lists of questions you can use to help you write your character bibles. None of these are perfect, but they give you examples of what should go into a character bible.

In the next chapter, you’ll find the questions I used in creating the character bibles for Goldilocks and the other characters in this book.

You may find it helpful to find a picture of a real person who looks like each of your characters.

Here is your place to go deep. You want to know your character’s family history, their religion, their politics, their philosophy, their personality type.

And of course, there are an endless number of superficial questions you can ask about each character. There are authors who insist that you should know each character’s favorite ice cream. If that matters to you and your target audience, then write it down. If not, then don’t.





Step 8: Write a List of All Scenes

Take a few days to create a list of every scene in your novel.

The scene is the fundamental unit of fiction. Each scene happens at a particular place and time and includes certain characters.

Each scene needs to have conflict. If there is no conflict in a scene, then it’s not pulling its weight and you need to add conflict or kill the scene. Don’t put in scenes that just “add atmosphere” or “explain the backstory” or “show the character’s motivations.” Conflict is the gasoline that makes a story run.

I recommend using a spreadsheet to write your scene list. Each row of the spreadsheet will represent one single scene.

You’ll want one column to tell the point-of-view character of the scene. Another wide column will summarize what happens in the scene. You may add more columns with time stamps, projected word counts, or anything else. You are free to make your spreadsheets as complicated or simple as you like.

Some writers use 3x5 cards, with one scene per card. This works, but there are advantages to using a spreadsheet.

However you do it, make this list. It helps you see the story at a glance, and you can move scenes around as needed.





Step 9: Write a Plan for Each Scene

Take five minutes for each scene and jot down some crucial information that will help you write it. You may want to make a list of characters in the scene. You may want to describe the setting. If you have some amazing dialogue snippets for the scene, this is the place to save them.

I highly recommend that you analyze the scene’s conflict. Is it a Proactive Scene or a Reactive Scene?





A Proactive Scene has this structure:

Goal

Conflict

Setback





A Reactive Scene has this structure:

Reaction

Dilemma

Decision





There is no standard length for a scene. A scene can be a hundred words or five thousand words. My own personal average for my suspense fiction is about a thousand words per scene, which is four manuscript pages. Faster-paced fiction has shorter scenes. Slower-paced fiction has longer scenes. Choose the scene length that works for you.





Step 10: Write Your Novel

You now have a well-structured story planned. The story has a good hook. It has a sound Three-Act Structure. It has a number of deep, well-motivated characters. It has a complete list of scenes, and each scene has a strong conflict that will drive the story.

At this point, you are frothing at the mouth in your eagerness to write your novel.

Do so.

For each scene in your scene list, read everything you’ve planned for the scene and then just start typing.

For a Snowflaker, this is the joy of fiction—writing the first draft of a novel that you already know is going to be a great story.





Closing Thoughts

Remember that not everybody is a Snowflaker, and that’s okay. Some people must write seat-of-the-pants. Some people must write a synopsis. Some people have other creative paradigms.

What matters is that you find a way that works well for you, so that you can write the first draft of your novel.

If the Snowflake Method works for you, then use it and be happy.

If only a few parts of it work for you, then use those and be happy.

If none of it works for you, then find some other method and be happy.

The Snowflake Method is nothing more nor less than the method that works best for me in writing fiction. If you can use it to guide your creativity as you write a powerful story, then I’ll be thrilled.

I first posted my Snowflake article on my website in early 2003. In the years since, that page has been viewed more than 3.9 million times. I’ve heard from untold numbers of writers who’ve found it helpful. I would guess that there are tens of thousands of novelists around the world who use it.

I wish you the best of luck in your writing career, no matter what methods you use.

Have fun!
