title: Chapter 16 Reaction, Dilemma, Decision

GOLDILOCKS LEAPED UP, holding her purse in front of her as if it were a shield. Her heart was beating so fast it hurt. Adrenaline raced through her body. Her breath was coming in short little gasps, and her entire body felt horribly cold. She wanted to run, but her feet felt frozen in place. She looked frantically for a way to get past Tiny Pig to the arch that led out of the court.

Tiny Pig adjusted his position to block her path and then took a step toward her, the needle of the syringe pointed directly at her. “This won’t hurt a bit, Miss.” He took another step.

Goldilocks saw that she was trapped in the corner of the patio. She backed up and backed up, trying desperately to catch her breath. She wanted to scream, but she couldn’t say a word.

Tiny Pig moved closer.

Goldilocks tried to dial 911, but the phone fell out of her nerveless hand.

Closer.

Goldilocks clutched her purse, thinking she was going to faint at any moment.

Closer.

Goldilocks reached in her purse and grabbed her canister of pepper spray. Her fingers felt as big and clumsy as sausages.

Tiny Pig rushed at her.

Goldilocks squeezed.

A thin spray of pepper hit Tiny Pig in the eyes.

He collapsed on the ground, squealing in rage, pawing at his eyes.

Suddenly, Goldilocks could breathe again. She sucked in air and screamed as loud as she could.

Tiny Pig wiped his eyes. Incredibly, he was still holding the syringe. He began crawling toward her, half-blind.

Goldilocks screamed again.

Robin Hood appeared through the arch in the hedge. “Sounds like a wench in distress—”

“He’s the murderer!” Goldilocks pointed at Tiny Pig. “Do something!”

Tiny Pig pushed himself closer to her, jabbing the syringe blindly at her legs.

Robin Hood whipped out an arrow and nocked it in his bowstring. “Freeze, pig!” he shouted. “If you move a muscle, you’ll be roasting in Sherwood Forest over an open fire tonight.”

Tiny Pig froze.

Goldilocks stepped past Tiny Pig and picked up her phone and dialed 911.

It rang twice and then …

A voice said, “What is the nature of your emergency?”

“I … I need the police to come,” Goldilocks said. “I think I’ve caught the real murderer of Little Pig.”
