title: Chapter 17 Planning Your Scenes
---

THE MORNING PASSED in a blur. The police came and arrested Tiny Pig. Goldilocks drove to the jail and waited for the Big Bad Wolf to be released. There was a long delay, but the police finally let him out. She brought him back to the conference center just in time for lunch. The entire conference burst into applause when Goldilocks and the Big Bad Wolf entered the cafeteria.

After lunch, they walked to the final session that Baby Bear would be teaching on the Snowflake Method. On the way, the Big Bad Wolf got a phone call.

Goldilocks couldn’t hear what the caller was saying, but the Big Bad Wolf kept saying, “Yes, that’s wonderful,” and his smile kept getting wider and wider. He hung up just as they reached the classroom.

“What was that all about?” Goldilocks said.

The Big Bad Wolf’s eyes gleamed with joy. “Tiny Pig confessed. And not only—”

“That’s wonderful!” Goldilocks began shrieking in delight and threw her arms around him and gave him a gigantic hug.

Baby Bear opened the door. “Come in, both of you! Congratulations, Wolf. And congratulations, Goldilocks. You showed a lot of guts this morning. When everybody else had given up on the Big Bad Wolf, you followed your instincts.”

“One amazing wench,” Robin Hood said.

Goldilocks felt too happy to get angry about being called a wench.

The Big Bad Wolf wore a grin a mile wide. “You’ve restored my faith in humans,” he said.

“I just … had a hunch,” Goldilocks said. “When Baby Bear talked about time stamps, I realized that I might be able to find some evidence.”

“But … dearie, why were you looking for evidence in the first place?” said Mrs. Hubbard. “The police don’t often make mistakes.”

“Ha!” said Robin Hood. “The Sheriff of Nottingham does nothing but make mistakes.”

“I just …” Goldilocks felt very foolish. “I felt in my heart that the Big Bad Wolf wasn’t the type to kill Little Pig.”

The Big Bad Wolf hung his head modestly. “Thank you for believing in me. I just heard from my lawyer. As it turns out, Tiny Pig had a very good motive for killing his uncle. He was a trust-fund brat. When he came of age, he received all the money he inherited from his father—Little Pig’s brother. But now he’s spent just about all of it.”

“So he wanted more from Little Pig?” Baby Bear said.

The Big Bad Wolf shook his head. “He wanted money, yes, so he called Little Pig two weeks ago to demand a cushy job. But Little Pig turned him down flat, and said something that got Tiny Pig thinking. Tiny Pig did some research, and that’s when he decided that he wanted something money can’t buy.”

Goldilocks saw it all in a flash. “You didn’t murder Little Pig’s brothers. Which means somebody else did. Somebody who would benefit from them being gone. And Tiny Pig figured out who it was and how he did it.”

“Little Pig!” shouted Robin Hood.

“Exactly,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “As part of his business empire, Little Pig was the CEO of a drug company. Tiny Pig’s syringe contained a powerful sedative—enough to kill you, Goldilocks. Enough to knock out Little Pig so he could be murdered in a way that looked like a wolf did it.”

“Would it put a wolf to sleep for twenty-four hours so he wouldn’t have an alibi on the day he was being framed for murder?” said Goldilocks.

The Big Bad Wolf’s face lit up in an enormous smile. “My lawyer says Tiny Pig has proof that Little Pig did exactly that. As part of his plea bargain, Tiny Pig is giving that evidence to the police. My lawyer says I’ll get my conviction overturned and my honor restored. It’s all thanks to you, Blondie.”

Baby Bear was jumping up and down with excitement. “Wolf, are you going to take on Goldilocks as your client?”

The Big Bad Wolf thought about that for a long minute. “I’d like to. We’ve become friends, and that’s important to me, because I only work with people I like. But I also only work with excellent writers, so I’ll need to see a polished draft of her book before I make a decision. Writing is a business, and even my friends don’t get a pass.”

Goldilocks felt so happy she wanted to scream. “I … I’d expect you to make decisions only if they’re good business. I wouldn’t want to work with an agent who makes decisions based on emotion. I don’t have my novel written yet, but … I will.”

“Are you ready to start writing?” Baby Bear said.

“I … sort of.” Goldilocks wanted so badly to say yes. But the truth was that she wasn’t quite there. She knew vaguely what would happen in her first scene. But she didn’t know if it would be a good scene. She felt like she was still missing something.

Baby Bear was studying her intently. “You seem a little hesitant. Perhaps we should talk about step 9 in the Snowflake Method. It’s about planning each scene before you write it.”

Goldilocks felt a rush of excitement. “What’s step 9?”

Baby Bear pointed to the hot seat. “We’ll learn this best by doing it.”

Goldilocks sat down.

Robin Hood whipped out his phone and took a picture of her. He looked at it and then handed it to her. “You are for sure one amazing wench, but you might want to think about finding a comb or something.”

Goldilocks stared at the picture. Her hair was a hot mess. There was a smudge of mud on her cheek. The collar of her blouse had a streak of blood on it.

And she didn’t care.

She handed the phone back to Robin Hood. “That’s not important. What’s important is how well you write, not what you look like. Baby Bear, tell me about step 9.”

“Bravo,” said the Big Bad Wolf, who was standing off the side, beaming. “Blondie, I’m beginning to think you have a little wolf blood in you.”

“Before you write any scene, you may find it helpful to plan it,” Baby Bear said. “There are two standard patterns for a scene. One pattern is called a Proactive Scene, which starts with a goal, continues for most of the scene with conflict, and then ends with a setback.”

The Big Bad Wolf stepped to the whiteboard and wrote:





PARTS OF A PROACTIVE SCENE:

Goal

Conflict

Setback





Baby Bear continued. “The other pattern is called a Reactive Scene. It starts with an emotive reaction to the setback in the previous scene. Then most of the scene is spent in analyzing the dilemma of what to do next. The scene ends with a decision.”

The Big Bad Wolf wrote:





PARTS OF A REACTIVE SCENE:

Reaction

Dilemma

Decision





“Dearie, I’m getting lost,” said Mrs. Hubbard. “Can you give us some examples?”

Baby Bear thought for a minute. “This morning when Goldilocks went running out of here, why did she do that?”

“Dude, she wanted to find some time stamps for before and after the murder of Little Pig,” said Robin Hood.

Goldilocks nodded. “My goal was to get time stamps.”

Baby Bear grinned. “A very modest goal, but also achievable. It was a steppingstone on the way to her larger goal, which was to clear the Big Bad Wolf’s name. But it turned out to be a fairly difficult goal, right?”

“It was horrible,” Goldilocks said. “I asked Papa Bear for help, and he didn’t want to be bothered, so I pestered him until he let me see the time stamp from his phone. But then it wasn’t any use.”

“Ah, you ran into conflict, and then you gave up and cried,” said Baby Bear. “Is that right?”

“I did not!” Goldilocks said hotly. “Then I asked Papa Bear for his coffee receipt, and he found it, and that was the first part of the evidence I needed.”

“But then you had no idea what to do next,” said Baby Bear. “More conflict. So then you cried, am I right?”

“Dude, you are, like, obsessed about this crying thing,” Robin Hood said. “And you are way wrong. She ran into me and yelled my ear off, and then she went stomping off like a wench on the warpath. She was awesome.”

“Then what happened?” Baby Bear said.

“I … um, found that photographer’s camera in the conference director’s office. But I heard voices coming—”

“More conflict,” said Baby Bear.

“And I borrowed the camera and ran and hid in the coffee shop patio. And then Tiny Pig showed up, and we found the proof that the Big Bad Wolf didn’t murder Little Pig.”

“Dude!” Robin Hood crowed at Baby Bear. “That’s not a setback. Hate to burst your bubble, but that is, like, one awesome victory. Goldilocks found the time stamp she was looking for. She achieved her goal. You better rethink your little theory there.”

Goldilocks started shaking. “But then Tiny Pig pulled out his syringe and tried to kill me.”

“Setback,” said Baby Bear with a smug little smile.

“Goal-conflict-setback.” The Big Bad Wolf checked each one off on the whiteboard. “I think the technical term here is ‘bazinga.’”

“And then I came in and saved the day,” said Robin Hood.

“You’re jumping the gun,” said Baby Bear. “There’s more that happened before you came in. We’ve just now worked through a complete Proactive Scene, but that’s not the end of the story. What happened next, Goldilocks? What did you do?”

Goldilocks remembered how she’d been frozen in place for a few seconds. “I … I didn’t do anything. I was so scared, I couldn’t move, couldn’t think, couldn’t even scream. I guess I’m just a dumb blonde.”

The Big Bad Wolf came up behind her and started kneading her shoulders. “You did exactly what most humans do the first time they face combat. People talk about ‘fight or flight,’ as if those are the only two options. But there’s a third option—freeze. It’s ‘fight or flight or fright.’ What you did was natural, and nothing to be ashamed of. At least you didn’t stay frozen, like some humans would have. And the reason is because you’ve been learning how to do courageous things lately. When the pinch came at the end, you had some courage in your emotional reserves.”

“The point is that your first action was not an action at all,” said Baby Bear. “It was a reaction. An emotive response to the very dangerous setback in the previous scene. Bears, pigs, wolves, humans—all of us feel emotions. Fear, joy, anxiety, love, rage. We can’t help ourselves. We’re not robots. We feel.”

“Well, it was horrible,” Goldilocks said. “I looked to see if I could get past Tiny Pig.”

“You were in a dilemma, so you considered your first option,” said Baby Bear.

“But he moved to block me, and I saw he had me cornered. So then I backed away from him.”

“Your first option failed, so you tried a second one.”

“And I backed right into the corner and couldn’t go any further. So I tried to use my phone.”

“Your second option failed, and you tried a third.”

“But I dropped my phone, and then I remembered my pepper spray.”

“Your third option failed, and you thought of a fourth.”

“I knew that would work, so I—”

“Decision!” Baby Bear said. “After considering three options that didn’t work, you made a decision on the fourth.”

“Would you just let me finish?” Goldilocks said. “So I reached into my purse and grabbed my pepper spray and let him have it right in the eyes.”

“That decision marks the end of a very short Reactive Scene,” said Baby Bear. “It also became the goal for the next Proactive Scene, which began immediately.”

Goldilocks saw it. “So you’re telling me that Proactive and Reactive Scenes just kind of chain together like that?”

“Exactly,” said Baby Bear. “Now let’s think about the first scene of your novel. Dirk parachutes into Elise’s garden and breaks his leg. What’s the goal of this scene?”

“To parachute into France behind enemy lines and hole up for the night.”

“And that goes smoothly, does it?”

Goldilocks shook her head. “No, there’s anti-aircraft fire, which they dodge. There’s a German plane that chases them and shoots them up. The engine catches fire. Dirk jumps out, but the other commandos are all killed when the plane explodes.”

“That’s the conflict,” Baby Bear said. “Enough for a scene of a few pages, very exciting. And then at the end, Dirk achieves his goal?”

“No! He breaks his leg and passes out,” Goldilocks said.

“Dude! That’s what I’d call a setback,” Robin Hood said. “Hey, this little theory thing of yours actually works.”

“Shocking,” said Baby Bear. “That’s your first scene, Goldilocks. Can you write that scene now?”

“I can if I make a few notes.” Goldilocks opened a new document on her laptop and rapidly typed one sentence for her goal, one for her conflict, and one for her setback. “Wow! That was easy. Can we do the next scene?”

“What’s going to happen next?” Baby Bear said.

“Elise hears something, so she goes outside and finds Dirk.”

“So Elise is your point-of-view character, right?”

Goldilocks nodded and typed “Elise.”

“What does she feel right away when she hears the noise?”

“Um … curious. A little nervous. Maybe worried that Monique is having a nightmare.”

“That’s not much of a reaction,” Baby Bear said. “Perhaps this shouldn’t be a Reactive Scene.”

Goldilocks felt horrible. “Oh, my! Is something wrong with my story?”

Baby Bear shook his head. “Not all emotive reactions are worth a full Reactive Scene. Most professional novelists write many more Proactive Scenes than Reactive Scenes. Let’s assume we can skip the Reactive Scene and go straight to a Proactive Scene. What’s her goal?”

“To find out what that noise was.”

“Good. Type that up,” said Baby Bear.

Goldilocks did. “So her conflict is that she checks on Monique, and she’s fine. She goes out in front to see if a tree fell, and everything’s fine. She goes out in the back and … there’s a man lying in her garden! And he’s muttering something in English.”

“There’s your setback,” said Baby Bear. “Then what does Elise feel?”

“She’s terrified,” Goldilocks said. “She sees right away that he’s an American commando. She knows that she has to turn him in to the authorities, because she’ll be shot if she’s discovered harboring an enemy of the Nazis.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “But …?”

“But she can’t! He would be killed. He’s trying to liberate her country. How could she turn him in? And …” Goldilocks blushed. “He’s very handsome. Is it shallow of Elise to notice that he’s handsome, so she wants to save him?”

The Big Bad Wolf howled with delight. “Blondie, there’s nothing to be ashamed of there. You humans act like your mating instincts are unnatural or something. Elise isn’t being shallow when she notices Dirk is handsome. She’s going deep there—deep into her wolf brain.”

Mrs. Hubbard scowled at him. “Wolf brain, my eye! Young man, if you’re going to spout your nonsense evolutionary theories that have been disproven—”

“Peace!” Baby Bear said. “Let’s stay focused, everyone. Elise has a dilemma. Turning in Dirk would violate every instinct of human decency, patriotism, and physical attraction that Elise has. But harboring Dirk would violate her instinct for survival and her instinct to protect her cub. Um, her daughter.”

Goldilocks was typing furiously. “And her decision—she’s got to decide to take care of him and hide him, but how can she do that when it’s so dangerous?”

“What are Elise’s Values?” Baby Bear said. “She has several Values—things she believes are more important than anything else. But those Values are in conflict. They can’t all be the most important thing to her. She must make a decision on which of her Values is truly most important. That’s what decisions do—they expose our true beliefs.”

“Nothing is more important than compassion,” Goldilocks said. “That’s her Value. It’s true that Elise is afraid to die and afraid to endanger Monique, but she’s more afraid to become like Henri—collaborating with the Nazis to hurt good people.”

Baby Bear smiled. “I think you’ve got a couple of scenes fleshed out there, a short Proactive Scene and then a Reactive Scene, both from Elise’s point of view.”

Goldilocks read through what she’d typed. It was very rough. There was a lot more that she could say. But it was enough.

“I hate to be the dude with the bad news,” Robin Hood said, “but we have, like, five minutes left in this class, and isn’t there another step to cover in your Snowflake Method? Tough luck, bro bear, but you aren’t gonna make it.”

Goldilocks looked at the clock.

Robin Hood was wrong. There were only three minutes left before the class was due to end. She had hogged all the time, and now Baby Bear was not going to be able to finish his workshop.
