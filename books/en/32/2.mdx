title: Chapter 2 Your Target Audience
---

THE TEACHER WAS a tiny, energetic bear who introduced himself as Baby Bear.

Goldilocks thought he couldn’t be much more than three feet tall, and she wondered why the conference organizers would hire such a young and inexperienced teacher.

“How many of you have tried outlining your novel and hated it?” Baby Bear asked.

Several students raised their hands, including Goldilocks.

“And how many of you have tried ‘organic writing’ and couldn’t make it work?” Baby Bear asked.

A different set of students raised their hands.

Goldilocks wondered if she was the only person who had tried both methods.

“This workshop is the first in a series—a major track that will continue for the rest of the conference,” Baby Bear said. “I’ll teach you a method that tens of thousands of writers around the world are using right now to write their novels. It might work for you, and then again it might not. Different writers are different, and your first mission as a novelist is to find the method that works best for you.”

Goldilocks sat up in her chair. She liked the fact that Baby Bear wasn’t making any wild promises.

“I need a volunteer to help me teach this first session,” Baby Bear said. “Who wants to help? I need somebody who’s thought quite a bit about their story and wants to start writing, but just can’t seem to get started.”

An old woman sitting next to Goldilocks raised her hand. “I’ve got a story about an old woman who went to the cupboard and it was bare.”

Baby Bear squinted at the old woman’s name tag. “Ah, Mrs. … Hubbard. Are you writing women’s fiction, then?”

Mrs. Hubbard shook her head. “No, I don’t think so. I don’t know what women’s fiction is. The story is mostly about the cupboard. It was bare, you see. That’s all I know about the story, so far.”

“I’m terribly sorry, ma’am, but I’m looking for a volunteer who’s a bit further along than that,” Baby Bear said. He pointed to a very large pig sitting in the second row. “What sort of novel are you writing, sir?”

The pig stood up and straightened his black bow tie. “Actually, I’m not writing the story myself. I’m looking for a coauthor to help me write a story about a young, industrious pig who rises from poverty to become a powerful and wealthy captain of industry.” He polished his spectacles on his tie. “It’s a bit autobiographical, but I’m no writer myself, and I just need somebody to help me put the words down. This book should write itself.”

Baby Bear read the pig’s name tag. “Well, Mr. Little Pig, you may just find yourself a coauthor here at this conference, but I’m looking for a volunteer who’s actually a writer. Somebody who’s already started writing and got stuck.”

Goldilocks felt her cheeks burning. She covered her face with her hands.

Baby Bear pointed at her. “Are you raising your hand, young lady?”

Goldilocks felt frozen with fright. She couldn’t possibly talk about her story in front of all these smart and savvy writers. That would be just too humiliating.

Baby Bear padded over to stand in front of her and took her hands in his warm, furry paws. “What kind of novel are you writing?”

“I’m … not quite sure what to call my kind of story,” Goldilocks said. “There’s a handsome man in it. And a beautiful woman. And an evil villain. And it’s set during World War II. And the story is going to be very exciting.”

Baby Bear nodded and tugged on her hand. “Very good, we can work with that. Come up to the hot seat and tell me about it.”

“But … all these people,” Goldilocks said. “They’re staring at me.”

Baby Bear led her up to a chair beside the front table and sat her down and then jumped up to sit on the table with his short legs hanging over the edge. “Pretend there’s nobody here but you and me. Tell me more about your story. Is it a romance novel?”

“Not … quite,” Goldilocks said. “They do fall in love, but it’s not only romance. The story is set right before D-Day, and there’s a lot going on. There are commandos on an important mission, and …” She sighed. “I don’t know how to explain it.”

“You’re doing fine,” Baby Bear said. “Is it a suspense novel?”

“I’m not exactly sure what that is.”

“A suspense novel is mainly about the plot. Something awful is about to happen, and the hero is there to prevent it. Or something wonderful is about to happen, and the hero is there to make it happen.”

“Well … that’s close, but not quite,” Goldilocks said. “My heroine is a French woman living in a small village during the German occupation. And my hero is an American agent who parachutes in behind enemy lines on an important mission, but he breaks his leg.”

“And these two meet up?” Baby Bear asked.

“Yes, in chapter 1. And she takes care of him and he tells her about his mission and she wants to help him but he’s falling in love with her and he’s afraid that the Nazis might kill her, but then she argues with him that just having him in her house has already put her in danger, and she’s a widow with a young daughter and—”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Baby Bear held up a furry paw. “You’ve got a fantastic story there! How much of it is written already?”

Goldilocks felt her face turning hot again. “Not … very much.”

“Well, I love it!” Baby Bear turned to the class. “How many of you like her story?”

Everybody raised their hands. Mrs. Hubbard was sitting forward in her chair and staring at Goldilocks as if she were somebody famous. Little Pig was leaning back in his chair, studying her with an appraising eye.

Baby Bear jumped off the table and peered at her name tag. “I suppose we should back up and make some introductions. Your name is … Goldilocks.” He studied her face intently. “You look familiar. Have you ever been to one of my writing classes before?”

Goldilocks shook her head. The only time she had ever seen a bear who looked anything like Baby Bear was a long time ago, on a perfectly dreadful day that she wanted very much to forget. “I’m just starting out learning how to write.”

“Well, you obviously have talent.”

“I do?” Goldilocks said.

“Of course!” Baby Bear said. “The main purpose of fiction is to give your reader what I call a ‘powerful emotional experience.’ And your book sounds like it’s going to generate all sorts of powerful emotions.”

Goldilocks felt her heart going pitty-pat. “When I was younger, everybody criticized me for being ‘too emotional.’”

Baby Bear gave her a long, searching look. “Why would you care what other people think about you?”

“Because it matters!” Goldilocks said.

“Why does it matter?”

Goldilocks just shook her head in exasperation. “Because it does!” Everyone must think she was very foolish to be arguing with a bear.

Baby Bear simply shrugged. “For a novelist, being ‘too emotional’ is often a good thing. The only thing you have to sell is your emotional experiences.”

Heads were nodding all around the room.

Goldilocks felt a warm feeling welling up inside of her. The other writers seemed to like her. They understood her. She hoped none of them noticed that she hadn’t done a good job on her hair this morning.

Baby Bear began pacing. “So, Goldilocks, you’re writing a romantic suspense novel set in World War II. That’s what we call your category.”

“Why is that important?” Goldilocks asked.

Baby Bear grinned. “When the bookstore gets copies of your book from your publisher, they need to know which shelf to put them on. As soon as they know your category, they’ve got their answer.”

Goldilocks had never thought about that.

“Now I want you to imagine that you’ve published your novel and it’s on the appropriate shelf at your local bookstore. Six people walk into the store. An older man and woman. A younger man and woman. A boy and a girl. Can you see them?”

Goldilocks nodded.

“Which one of them is going to be interested in your book?” Baby Bear asked.

“Well … all of them, I suppose,” Goldilocks said. “I want my novel to be a best seller. I want everybody to buy it.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “Let me tell you a bit more about these people. The older man is wearing a fishing cap. The older woman has on gardening gloves. The younger man is dressed like an accountant. The younger woman has two children clutching her hands, a boy and a girl. Which of those six people is going to be most interested in your book?”

“The younger woman,” Goldilocks said. “The other adults all came looking for nonfiction books, but that younger woman definitely wants my novel. And it’s too grown-up for the children.”

Baby Bear rubbed his paws together. “Excellent! That younger woman represents what we call your target audience. You’ll write the book for her, and for her alone. She’ll read the book, and she’ll love it, because it gives her a powerful emotional experience. She’ll tell other people about it, and some of them might like your book. But none of them will love it as much as she does. Is it okay with you if she’s your biggest fan?”

“Oh, that would be wonderful!” Goldilocks said. “I know just how she feels and thinks.”

Little Pig stood up and stamped loudly with his hooves on the tile floor. “That sounds like a terrible business decision,” he said.

Baby Bear spun to look at him. “And why do you say that?” he asked politely.

“Modern business requires economies of scale,” said Little Pig. “To make the highest possible profit, you need to move the maximum number of units at the lowest possible cost. That requires you to create products targeted to the lowest common denominator. That’s how I made my fortune, and that’s how I intend to write my book.”

Baby Bear scratched his furry chin and looked at the class. “How many of you want your work to be read by millions?”

Every student in the room raised their hands.

“And what’s the best-selling novel series of the last twenty years?” Baby Bear asked.

Mrs. Hubbard scowled. “It was those dreadful books about that Harvey Potter child. Witches and wizards and all sorts of wickedness.”

“A very stupid book,” growled Little Pig. “I stopped reading after the first page, when I saw how that woman maligned those respectable Dursleys.”

“And who was the target audience for the Harry Potter series?” asked Baby Bear.

Nobody said anything.

Goldilocks timidly raised her hand. “Wasn’t it … eleven-year-old boys?”

Baby Bear began jumping up and down, clapping his fat little paws. “Yes! Boys, aged eleven. The smallest niche market you can imagine. Everybody knows that boys don’t read. Everybody knows that eleven-year-old boys absolutely, positively won’t read anything. Especially a book written by a woman. And yet …”

“Harrumph!” Little Pig snorted. “Lots of people read the Harry Potter series. Although God only knows why anyone would read such nonsense.”

Baby Bear scratched his ears. “The author wrote her books for a very tight niche market. Eleven-year-old boys. But she delighted those boys, and they talked about it to eleven-year-old girls. They were also delighted and talked about it to twelve-year-olds. Who talked about it to thirteen-year-olds. And so on, until everybody was talking about it. What made that work?”

“A wicked spell?” said Mrs. Hubbard.

“Great marketing of an inferior product,” said Little Pig.

“Good writing that delighted her target audience?” said Goldilocks.

“Exactly!” said Baby Bear. “So when you go to write your story, you are not going to write for the whole world. You are going to choose your target audience and define it as tightly as you know how. You are going to write your story to delight your target audience. You will not care about anybody else.”

“But what if other people … hate my writing?” Goldilocks said. She couldn’t bear the thought of anybody not liking her novel.

“You. Don’t. Care.” Baby Bear got so excited, he began running in tight little circles. “The only people in the world that you have to make happy are the people in your target audience. If everybody else hates it, you don’t care.”

“That’s the biggest load of nonsense I’ve ever heard,” said Little Pig.

“But … there were ever so many people who read Harvey Potter who weren’t eleven-year-old boys!” said Mrs. Hubbard. “All sorts of folk who ought to have known better.”

“That’s my point!” said Baby Bear. “Here is your marketing plan, in three simple steps.” He went to the whiteboard and began writing in large letters.





YOUR MARKETING PLAN





Choose the target audience you want to delight.

Write the best story you can, aiming exactly at that target audience.

When you publish your story, market it ONLY to your target audience.

Your target audience will tell the rest of the world.





“That is four steps,” said Little Pig. “Apparently, bears can’t count.”

“But … we only have to do three of them,” Goldilocks said. “The fourth step happens on its own. I took marketing in college. That fourth step is what all marketers dream about. It’s called ‘word of mouth.’”

Baby Bear jabbed his paw in the air. “Bazinga!” he shouted. “Every writer desperately wants word of mouth to take off for their book. That happens only if you delight your target audience. That happens only if you write a book precisely for your target audience. That happens only if you make a conscious decision from the beginning on who your target audience is.”

The entire class went silent. Even Little Pig had nothing to say.

Baby Bear walked over to stand in front of Goldilocks. “Now, let’s continue. Your target audience is who, exactly?”

“Women about my age,” Goldilocks said, remembering what she had learned in college about demographics.

“Women your age read all sorts of novels. What sort of story exactly does your target audience like to read?”

“Exciting stories. Stories with something dangerous happening. There’s a handsome hero and a beautiful heroine. And they’re starting to fall in love, but they don’t dare, because that will ruin the mission. But they fall in love anyway, because they can’t help themselves. And there’s an evil villain waiting to ruin them. And everything goes from bad to worse to horrible, and it looks like they can’t possibly succeed in their mission, and even if they do, you just know that one of them will die tragically, and that would spoil their love story. And yet …”

Goldilocks stopped. She knew it sounded very foolish.

“And yet, somehow, it all works out in the end,” Baby Bear said.

“It might,” said Goldilocks. “Or one of them might die tragically. Because my books will sometimes have a happy ending and sometimes a tragic ending, so you never know how this book will end until you get there.”

Baby Bear spun to face the class. “How many of you would buy that kind of a book?”

A number of hands shot up around the room.

Mrs. Hubbard didn’t raise her hand.

Neither did Little Pig.

Goldilocks felt horrible for a moment. Not everybody liked her kind of story. In fact, more than half of the people didn’t like her kind of story.

“Marvelous!” said Baby Bear. “See how many people are in your target audience?”

Goldilocks thought that he sounded like one of those annoying glass-half-full kind of bears. Then she began looking at the people raising their hands. Some of them were the kind she had envisioned reading her story—young women like herself. But there were a couple of middle-aged men who liked her story. And a few older women. And some teens. She couldn’t imagine what demographic group might possibly fit this motley crowd.

“I think you’ve got a great target audience,” Baby Bear said. “You defined it by what they like, not by their age or their gender or their socioeconomic status. You gave me a psychographic, not a demographic.”

Goldilocks felt her head spinning. Was everything she had learned in college all wrong? And why were they wasting time talking about marketing when what she really wanted to do was talk about writing?

Baby Bear looked at his watch. “We need to take a ten-minute break. When we come back, we’ll continue with Goldilocks and her story. And I’ll teach you how to develop the most powerful marketing tool you can ever have for your novel.”

The students noisily went out of the room.

Goldilocks followed them, feeling terribly disappointed. She had spent all of college learning marketing, and she was bored to death of it. She wanted to learn how to write a novel, not market a novel. Perhaps her best bet would be to quietly sneak away and go home.
