title: Chapter 13 Your Third Disaster
---

“EVERYBODY STAY IN your seats,” Baby Bear said. “I need to check on something.” He hurried to the door and flung it open.

The wail of the ambulance poured into the room.

Baby Bear sprinted out into the hallway, slamming the door shut behind him.

The class began buzzing.

Goldilocks felt like her head was filled with sand.

Somebody tapped her on the shoulder. It was Mrs. Hubbard. “Dearie, would you put in a word for me with that lovely fellow, the Big Bad Wolf? I was hoping to ask him to look at my manuscript.”

Goldilocks didn’t know what to say. “Did anyone see the Big Bad Wolf go out?”

“We were all watching you,” said Robin. “Goldilocks, you are, like, one amazing wench.”

A police siren sounded, far away, hurtling toward them.

Goldilocks felt like she was going to lose her breakfast.

The door flew open and Baby Bear staggered in. “I have some very bad news. There’s been a … murder over at the coffee shop. Little Pig is dead. Papa Bear has made a citizen’s arrest.”

“Who was it, dude?” asked Robin. “I bet it was the Big Bad Wolf, am I right?”

Tears stood out in Baby Bear’s eyes. “I just … can’t believe it. I was so sure he’d reformed.”

Goldilocks gasped. “Oh, my!” She felt numb all over. This couldn’t be true. She knew the Big Bad Wolf. He was a very nice wolf. She felt certain he had been joking when he made those threatening comments.

Mrs. Hubbard began sobbing softly. “That Little Pig was such a nice young pig.”

Then suddenly, the whole class was on their feet and surging toward the door.

Goldilocks joined in the rush to get out.

“Wait, everybody!” shouted Baby Bear. “The police will need you to make statements.”

But nobody was listening.

Somebody jostled Goldilocks from behind.

She tripped and fell.

Strong paws gripped Goldilocks and pulled her to one side, out of the rush of trampling feet.

In a moment, the room was empty except for Goldilocks and Baby Bear.

“Thank you for rescuing me,” Goldilocks said.

The door flew open and Mama Bear staggered in. “Oh, this is perfectly dreadful! I can’t believe what’s happened. I knew you should never have brought that terrible wolf to help out in your classes, Baby Bear. You know what sort of family he comes from, not to mention his record. And now this!” She wrung her paws dramatically and began sobbing.

Baby Bear shook his head, a perplexed look on his face. “I don’t see how this could have happened. The Big Bad Wolf was napping in the corner. He must have slipped out while I was working with Goldilocks.”

“Oh, it’s just horrible, horrible!” Mama Bear sniffled loudly and wiped her nose with the back of her paw. “The police are questioning the Big Bad Wolf right now. We’ll be ruined when word gets out that it was you who invited him to the conference.”

Goldilocks began trembling. “Do you think it’s … quite certain he killed Little Pig?”

Baby Bear put his laptop into his backpack. “Papa Bear doesn’t make mistakes. If he arrested the Big Bad Wolf, then … he’s absolutely certain he’s guilty.”

“But what do you think?” Goldilocks said. “Could he have done it?”

“I just … don’t know,” said Baby Bear. “He’s a well-mannered wolf, but he is a wolf. He was convicted of murdering Little Pig’s two brothers years ago. And Papa Bear says he caught him practically red-handed. So the evidence is very strong.”

“Evidence, shmevidence,” said Mama Bear. “What do you feel? Do you feel in your heart that he’s a killer?”

Baby Bear’s face sagged. “Maybe,” he said in a very small voice. “I hate to say it, but yes, I think he did it. Again.”

Goldilocks fanned her face. If even Baby Bear thought the Big Bad Wolf had done it, then … she had to face the facts. The Big Bad Wolf was guilty.

The conference director came in. She was a short, stout woman with gray hair and a severe face. “You all are needed for questioning. The police want to know what you saw and when you saw it.”

The bears and Goldilocks went out and walked down the long tiled hallway to the doors. Outside, several police cars had pulled up on the sidewalk near the coffee shop and sat parked at odd angles with their blue-and-red lights flashing. There was yellow crime scene tape across the front door of the coffee shop and all around the patio in back.

Goldilocks moved closer to see what had happened.

There was a large crowd gathered there, gawking and murmuring.

Papa Bear was surrounded by policemen. His voice boomed out. “I’ve told you this six times. I went in to buy coffee, and then walked out through the side door onto the back patio. I saw Little Pig lying on the concrete, stabbed to death. There was blood everywhere, and wolf tracks in the mud by the body. I went running back to the conference center building and found the Big Bad Wolf in the men’s room washing his paws.”

Two burly policemen came out of the coffee shop, leading the Big Bad Wolf. He was handcuffed, and two more policemen were walking behind him, guns drawn.

The Big Bad Wolf’s eyes were red and swollen, and his face looked paralyzed with fear.

Goldilocks thought he might have been crying.

“Move along, people, nothing to see here,” said one of the cops. He led the way to a police car and opened the back door.

The Big Bad Wolf staggered along in a daze.

A policeman put his hand on top of the Big Bad Wolf’s head and pushed him down into the car. Two cops got in the backseat on either side of him. The other two got in the front.

The siren started, and the car pushed forward through the crowd.

“He … I don’t think he did it!” Goldilocks said. “Did you see his face?”

“I saw it,” Papa Bear growled. “If ever I’ve seen a guilty look on a wolf’s face, it was right there.”

Mama Bear joined them, and her whole body shook with sobs. “This is just horrible, horrible! And to think that our son knows him! We’ll be ruined.”

Baby Bear frowned at them. “We’ll be ruined? Nonsense. It’s the Big Bad Wolf who’ll be ruined. He’s been working so hard to build his client list. And now he’s going back to prison. He’ll never get out after a second murder rap.”

“But … how do we know for sure he did it?” Goldilocks said.

The three bears stared at her.

Goldilocks felt very foolish, but she had to stand up for what she thought. “What if he’s innocent?” she said.

Papa Bear shook his head. “Miss Goldilocks, you’re obviously very young and inexperienced. If anything is certain, it’s that the Big Bad Wolf killed Little Pig.”

“Oh, if only you had never invited this horrible wolf to the conference!” Mama Bear shook her paw at Baby Bear.

“Well, I couldn’t have known he was going to kill Little Pig,” Baby Bear said angrily. “I thought he was reformed.”

“He’s a wolf, son,” said Papa Bear. “Wolves don’t change. If you’re wicked, then you’re wicked right through, and nothing is going to change who you are.”

He was looking right at Goldilocks when he said this.

Goldilocks felt so guilty she thought she was going to explode.

“You look familiar,” said Mama Bear. “Haven’t I seen you before?”

Goldilocks felt her whole body turn hot. “I … I was in your workshop the other day—the one on organic writing.”

“Ah.” Mama Bear fixed a skeptical eye on her. “I could swear I’ve seen you somewhere else, a long time ago.”

Goldilocks wanted to run and hide. But she’d been running and hiding all her life, and she was tired of it. “I … I have a confession to make. Years ago, I … went out for a long walk in the woods. I came to a small cottage and went inside. I was horribly hungry and I ate some food. Then I broke one of the chairs and fell asleep in one of the beds.”

“You!” shouted Papa Bear. “You’re the criminal!”

“I … I want to make it right,” Goldilocks said. “I want to pay for the damage I did.”

“I’ll have you arrested.” Papa Bear spun around and waved toward the police officers still on the scene.

None of them seemed to notice him.

Goldilocks felt like she had drunk a pitcher of ice water.

“Now, Papa.” Mama Bear moved forward and wrapped up Goldilocks in a huge, furry hug. “She was just a young girl. And she’s lived with the guilt all these years. Surely, if she pays for the damage, that will be all anyone could ask.”

“Perhaps she had a horrible childhood,” Baby Bear said. “Perhaps she was lost. Or hungry. Or frightened of bears. There could be … all sorts of reasons she did what she did.”

“Harrumph! She should have gone to jail.” Papa Bear scowled at Goldilocks.

“I’m very sorry for what I did,” Goldilocks said. “I’ll pay for the damage.”

“Well … of course, I kept the receipts for repairs,” Papa Bear said. “In a file in my office. A tax deduction, you know. There’s a line item for losses due to crime.”

“I … feel so awful about it,” Goldilocks said.

“It’s quite all right, dear.” Mama Bear patted her heavily on the back. “If you knew some of the shenanigans Baby Bear got into as a young bear—”

Baby Bear cleared his throat. “Goldilocks, if you really don’t think the Big Bad Wolf is guilty, then I suggest you go visit him and get his side of the story. Because as of right now, you’re the only person who thinks he’s innocent.”

She nodded. “Of course. I’m sorry I’ll miss your class after lunch.”

“There won’t be any classes this afternoon,” Mama Bear said. “I’ve already spoken with the conference director, and they’re canceling all workshops for the afternoon. The police will need to talk to everybody, especially you, Baby Bear.”

Papa Bear was still frowning. “You ought to have known what sort of family he came from, son. Murder is in his genes, in his blood. You can’t change what you are.”

Goldilocks didn’t believe him. She knew people could change. Wolves could change too.

She had to visit the Big Bad Wolf and get his side of the story.



* * *



That afternoon, Goldilocks went to visit the Big Bad Wolf. She had to wait a long time at the local jail.

An unpleasant female cop searched her roughly for weapons before allowing her into the visitation room.

Goldilocks sat down in a painful plastic chair at a long, cheap Formica-topped table that split the room in half from one wall to the other. A ceiling-high glass partition ran down the middle of the table. The room was empty and smelled like dirty gym socks and mildew. Goldilocks waited for a quarter of an hour before the door opened.

The Big Bad Wolf shuffled in, staring at the floor, handcuffed and shackled, wearing an orange jumpsuit. His face looked haggard. He slumped into his seat and only then looked at his visitor. “Oh, it’s you!” He hung his head. “I’m sorry. I suppose you think I’m a horrible person.”

Goldilocks wanted to hug him. “I think you’re a good and kind wolf. I think there’s been a terrible mistake. I don’t believe you killed Little Pig.”

The Big Bad Wolf’s eyebrows shot up for just an instant. “You don’t?”

“Absolutely not. You couldn’t have. You aren’t that kind of wolf.”

“I don’t have any alibi to prove I didn’t. What makes you think I’m innocent?”

“Because you’re kind,” said Goldilocks. “You care about people. You help people with their writing. I know you make jokes about eating little pigs, but they’re only jokes. So tell me what really happened.”

“I was sleeping and having a terrible dream,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “There was a little pig making rude comments about me. Old Mother Hubbard was complaining about her bare cupboard. Some idiot in a Robin Hood suit was making crude remarks to young wenches. And then I woke up and needed to use the men’s room. I had a big latte this morning, and … um …”

“I get it, I get it.” Goldilocks blushed.

“Baby Bear had you up front on the hot seat talking about something or other, and I just slipped out through the back door and went to the men’s room. Then I was washing my paws when Papa Bear burst in, saw me, started shouting horrible things, and threw me on the floor. He sat on top of me and called 911. The next thing I knew, the police were there. They took me over to the coffee shop, way around to the back patio. They made me look at that poor Little Pig, stabbed to death in the back corner, lying in a pool of blood. Then they started shouting at me.”

Tears began streaming down the Big Bad Wolf’s face. “They asked if I had any idea what might have happened to him. Asked if I had any thoughts on who the killer might be. I think they were trying to make me confess before they formally arrested me and read me my rights. But I had nothing to confess. So they brought me here and spent two hours interrogating me.”

“That’s horrible,” Goldilocks said.

“Did anybody in the class see me when I left the room?” asked the Big Bad Wolf. “Because Papa Bear arrested me only a minute or two after that.”

Goldilocks shook her head. “I didn’t. Baby Bear didn’t. I think everybody was watching him and me up front, but I’ll ask around and see if anyone saw you leave.”

“All the evidence is against me. It’s circumstantial evidence, but I don’t have an alibi and I do have a record. I don’t stand a chance. Nobody believes me. Even my lawyer doesn’t believe me.”

“I believe you.” Goldilocks stood up and leaned forward as close to the glass partition as she could. “There’s got to be a way to prove you’re innocent, and I’m going to find it.”

“Are you sure you want to do that?” the Big Bad Wolf said. “It’s going to ruin your reputation. People are going to wonder why you’re standing up for me. People are going to talk about you. They might even start looking into your past, and—”

“I don’t care what people think!” Goldilocks said. “I’m going to do what I think is right, and if people think ill of me, that’s their problem.”

The Big Bad Wolf simply stared at her. A look of awe shone in his gleaming eyes. “You’ve … changed, Goldilocks. Just a few days ago, you were letting other people’s opinions dictate your life.”

“You better believe I’ve changed, and you helped me do it. When you shot Baby Bear, I decided that nothing was going to stop me from being a writer. And then when Little Pig told me you were going to reject me, I realized that I had to stand up for my story, even if it cost me my chance to land a famous agent.”

The Big Bad Wolf was counting on his fingers. “Those are two disasters. Now here’s a third disaster—I’m accused of murder—and you’re committing to defend me at any cost. How do you feel right now?”

“Terrified,” said Goldilocks. “Excited. Foolish. Ready to throw myself wholeheartedly into the battle and win.”

“Remember that feeling,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Lock it away in your heart. That is exactly the way Elise is going to feel at her third disaster, when she rescues Monique and Dirk gets badly wounded. She could run away, but she resolves to help blow up the ammo dump and help win the war. She’s committing to an ending, happy, sad, or bittersweet.”

Goldilocks was trembling. “Elise’s story is just like my story, isn’t it?”

“That’s what story is for,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Story teaches you how to do the right thing. By living inside the skins of characters who do the right thing, you develop the emotional muscle memory to do the right thing yourself.”

A guard appeared at the door and stabbed a finger at Goldilocks. “Time!”

She stood up and headed toward the door, then turned and blew the Big Bad Wolf a kiss. “I won’t let you down.”

He managed a weak grin. “Succeed or fail, you’ve already won.”

The guard hauled Goldilocks out, and the heavy metal door slammed shut.

Goldilocks hadn’t missed the look of anguish on the wolf’s face. He was proud of her for wanting to help. But it was obvious that he thought she was going to fail.

The Big Bad Wolf had given up hope.
