title: Chapter 11 Your Long Synopsis
---

GOLDILOCKS WAS THE first person in the classroom the next morning. She hoped the Big Bad Wolf would arrive early, too, so she could talk to him about possibly being his client. Or Baby Bear, so she could show him her latest revisions.

But the second person to arrive was Little Pig. He walked straight toward the seat next to Goldilocks and sat down. “Did you get all your homework done last night?”

Goldilocks nodded and began to tell him of the surprises she’d found as she dug deep into each of her characters.

Little Pig nodded wisely as she talked. He seemed very interested in her story and asked several questions.

Before Goldilocks knew it, Baby Bear was rapping on the front table with his paws. “Good morning! I can see that there are fewer of you here today, but those who are here are the ones willing to put in the hard work. I’m proud of you all.”

Goldilocks looked around to see who was there.

The room was only about two-thirds full.

The Big Bad Wolf walked in sipping a large coffee. He gave Goldilocks a little wave, then scowled at Little Pig and found a seat near the back.

“Today, in the sixth step of the Snowflake,” said Baby Bear, “we’ll return to the plot of our stories. Remember that we alternate between characters and plot, characters and plot. That helps ensure that as we grow up our story, it’s balanced.”

“Dude, are we going to write a synopsis one of these days?” asked a young man in the second row. He was wearing an all-leather outfit, complete with a large bow and a quiver full of arrows. “Because I hear that’s like the most important thing when you’re trying to sell a book.”

Baby Bear squinted at his name tag and then beamed at him. “Yes, Mr. Hood. Today, we’ll take the one-page synopsis that you wrote yesterday and expand each paragraph out to about a full page. That should give you four or five pages, which I call the long synopsis.”

“And we’ll use this for what, exactly?” said Little Pig.

“Several things,” said Baby Bear. “First, it helps you understand your story better. It makes you flesh out the details. You may find plot problems to be solved. You may find your theme emerging. You may see your characters getting deeper.”

Goldilocks was taking notes on her laptop under the main heading PURPOSE OF LONG SYNOPSIS. She typed: 1) Flesh out story.

“Second,” said Baby Bear, “the long synopsis will help you when we get to step 8 of the Snowflake, in which you’ll make a list of your scenes.”

Goldilocks typed: 2) Prepare for scene list.

Little Pig was drumming his hoof rapidly on the desktop. “Yes, but what about this business of selling the book?”

Baby Bear pointed to the back of the room. “Since we have a very prominent agent with us, I’ll let the Big Bad Wolf talk about the importance of synopses.”

The Big Bad Wolf stood up and took a long sip of his coffee. “Synopses are boring. Editors hate reading them. Agents hate reading them. What we like reading is your actual story—that’s the fun part. But you have to write a synopsis or we won’t even look at your story. Don’t ask me why. It’s a dumb tradition. So the first rule of writing a synopsis is this: shorter is better.”

Goldilocks raised her hand. “If shorter is better, why do outliners write hundred-page synopses?”

“Because outliners need a ten-page or fifty-page or hundred-page synopsis just to write their first draft,” said Baby Bear. “Writing the synopsis is part of their creative paradigm. They write the synopsis for their own benefit. But they don’t send that huge synopsis to their agent and editor.”

The Big Bad Wolf looked horrified. “If you send me an enormous synopsis, I’ll burn it. I want to see at least two pages, no more than four. Period.”

“So the third use of your long synopsis,” Baby Bear said, “is to give you the raw material for the synopsis you’ll send your agent.”

Goldilocks typed: 3) Raw material for synopsis for agent.

Little Pig cleared his throat. “So you’re telling us to do all this work on a long synopsis just … so we can do more work?” He sounded very irritated.

“I’m telling you that the long synopsis is a useful step on the way to understanding your story,” said Baby Bear. “And a useful step on the way to writing a proposal for your agent.”

“Time is money,” said Little Pig. “This sort of busywork might be fine for the little people, but—”

“Tonight’s homework,” Baby Bear interrupted, “for those of you who don’t consider the job beneath you, is to write a long synopsis for your novel. Just expand out the story in your short one-page synopsis, and you’ll find that your long synopsis practically writes itself.”

“Say, Goldilocks,” said Little Pig. “I’ve been watching you, and you’re quite a writer. Very gifted. How would you like to work with me on an amazing story, based on the life of an amazing pig?”

Goldilocks wasn’t sure whether to laugh or to cry or to run screaming for the door.

“She’s not interested,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

Little Pig’s head spun around. “Who asked you? I’m talking to Goldilocks. She’s good at this sort of thing—”

“You’re basically saying she’s one of the little people who are good at busywork.” The Big Bad Wolf glared at Little Pig. “Goldilocks is a talented writer, and she’s got bigger fish to fry than to work on a stupid egomaniac’s personal-experience story, thinly disguised as a novel.”

Little Pig stood up. “You just see her as another cog in your empire. You want to take advantage of her and charge your outlandish agent fees while she does all the work. But what if her story never sells?”

“It’ll sell,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Which is more than I can say for your stupid story. The best place for that is the National Enquirer.”

“The National Enquirer?” shrieked Little Pig. “Over my dead body!”

The Big Bad Wolf grinned maliciously. “That can be arranged, little piggie.”

“Stop it, both of you!” Goldilocks shouted. She pointed a finger at the Big Bad Wolf. “You shouldn’t say things like that. You need to apologize.”

“Sorry.” The Big Bad Wolf didn’t look a bit sorry.

“And as for you …” Goldilocks looked at Little Pig. “You have insulted me and demeaned me in every possible way. You are the last person I would ever coauthor a book with, and that’s final!”

Little Pig’s face ran through a rapid series of expressions. Shock. Rage. Humiliation. Cold fury. “Fine. You’ve had your chance. I’m out of here. If there are any other writers who want an excellent opportunity to work with a demanding yet good-hearted pig at a very reasonable level of pay, I’ll be in the coffee shop for the next hour.”

He stomped out of the classroom, leaving little black hoof marks on the tile floor.

The room sat in uneasy silence for a few seconds.

“Well,” said Baby Bear. “It takes all kinds. Little Pig is one of those that it takes all kinds of. Now, is your homework assignment clear?”

All the students nodded.

Baby Bear looked straight at the Big Bad Wolf. “You were a bit harsh on him, you know. You really ought to … let things go.”

The Big Bad Wolf scowled. “He lied about me on the witness stand about some threats I supposedly made against his brothers. That took six years out of my life. Be my guest, Baby Bear. You go do time in the Big House for a crime you didn’t commit, and then you can come and talk to me about letting things go. Until then, forget it.”

Goldilocks was trying to make sense of all this. The Big Bad Wolf had been convicted … on Little Pig’s testimony? Was it Little Pig’s brothers he’d been accused of murdering?

“In any event,” said Baby Bear, “we’ve discussed the long synopsis, and now I want to cover character bibles. That will be step 7 of the Snowflake. After that, we still have three steps in the Snowflake Method, and we need to get through those because we’ll be wrapping up the conference tomorrow afternoon.”

“Dude, don’t we get, like, a break or something?” said the young man in the second row.

Baby Bear checked his watch. “I suppose, but we really need to keep moving. You can all take a five-minute break, but please don’t loiter. We still have a lot of ground to cover.”

Goldilocks had been planning to talk to the Big Bad Wolf during the break. But she felt so shocked by his bad-tempered outburst over Little Pig that she was having second thoughts. She didn’t want an agent who would be hard to work with, and the Big Bad Wolf clearly had a dark side.
