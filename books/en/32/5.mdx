title: Chapter 5 The Importance of Being Disastrous
---

THE BIG BAD Wolf pointed his gun at Goldilocks. “What’s this I hear about you wanting to use the Snowflake Method? If you do, I’ll make it painful for you. Very painful.”

Goldilocks felt a rush of heat in her veins. He had no right! She put her head down and ran directly at the Big Bad Wolf, spearing him in the stomach.

The Big Bad Wolf flew backward and hit the floor with a giant “oomph!”

Goldilocks landed on top of him, punching, kicking, biting, scratching, and screaming. She sat on his stomach and pinned his paws on each side of his head. “Somebody grab his gun!”

“Hey, take it easy, Blondie!” said the Big Bad Wolf. “I can explain.”

“You killed Baby Bear!” Goldilocks bellowed. “And now you want me to take it easy?”

“I didn’t … kill anyone,” said the Big Bad Wolf, grunting for breath.

A furry paw settled on Goldilocks’s shoulder.

She spun her head to look.

Baby Bear stood there grinning. “I’m fine. This is my friend, the Big Bad Wolf. I asked him to burst in and fire a blank at me. I had a capsule of fake blood in my paw, and I smashed it on my chest.”

Goldilocks was so surprised, she couldn’t think. “You’d better get that fur in cold water right away or the blood is never going to come out.”

The Big Bad Wolf wriggled underneath her. “Hey, Blondie, no offense, but you’re kind of heavy, and you’re sitting on my stomach.”

Goldilocks felt very foolish sitting on the wolf, so she stood up. She scowled and jabbed a finger at Baby Bear. “What is the meaning of all this? You two scared me to death with your horrible stunt.”

Baby Bear went down on one knee and took Goldilocks’s hand in his soft paw. “I’m very sorry. I wanted to teach you something, and that was the best way I knew to do it. Will you forgive me?”

Goldilocks didn’t know what to say. Her insides were all in a tizzy. She felt hot and angry and frightened and embarrassed, all at the same time.

The Big Bad Wolf stood up and dusted himself off, then pressed a paw carefully into his belly. “Humans have very hard heads, did you know that?”

Goldilocks realized she could have hurt the Big Bad Wolf very badly. “I’m sorry. I … thought you had killed Baby Bear. And I thought you were going to kill me.”

“Why would I kill you?” the Big Bad Wolf asked. A sly smile slid across his face. “I said I’d shoot you only if you decided to use the Snowflake Method.”

“Because …” Goldilocks didn’t realize she’d made the decision until she thought about it just now. “Because when you threatened me, when you said I couldn’t use the Snowflake Method, I realized that … I really do want to try it out.”

“Bazinga!” shouted Baby Bear. He leaped up in the air and began dancing around in a small circle, pumping his paws in the air like he’d scored a touchdown. He raced toward the table, leaped in the air, did a double flip, and landed on top, spinning to face the students. “Did everybody see what just happened there? Goldilocks made a decision.”

All the students were staring at him with their mouths hanging open.

The Big Bad Wolf went to the whiteboard and picked up a marker. He held it poised at the board and wrote:





WHY YOUR STORY NEEDS DISASTERS

1.

2.

3.





Baby Bear said, “In your story, you must have disasters. Big, horrible, hairy disasters. Where people get hurt, possibly. Or somebody threatens to hurt them. Why?”

“Because … it’s exciting?” Goldilocks said.

The Big Bad Wolf wrote:





1. EXCITEMENT





“Yes,” Baby Bear said. “It’s exciting to see one of your favorite bears get killed. But excitement is not enough. What else does a disaster do?”

Goldilocks mentally reviewed the sequence of events. The Big Bad Wolf had shot Baby Bear. Then he had threatened her with the same. And it had forced her to see what was important to her. Just before he was shot, Baby Bear had been asking her whether she wanted to use the Snowflake Method. She had waffled. But once the Big Bad Wolf told her she couldn’t, she saw very clearly how much she wanted to.

“What else does a disaster do?” Baby Bear asked again.

“It … forced me to make a decision,” Goldilocks said.

The Big Bad Wolf wrote:





2. DECISION





“Exactly.” Baby Bear did a double backflip off the table and landed in Goldilocks’s arms. He planted a furry kiss on her cheek.

Goldilocks wasn’t sure how she felt about that. She really didn’t want bear germs on her face, but she squeezed Baby Bear in a big hug because she realized that she liked him very much, even if he was a bear, and a silly one at that. She set him down on the floor. “But … why do I need to make decisions?”

The Big Bad Wolf grinned. “Because it sends your story in a new direction. It keeps things interesting. Otherwise, your story would start feeling like it’s all alike.” He wrote:





3. NEW DIRECTIONS





Baby Bear began pacing back and forth. “Your reader wants all of those things. Excitement. Decisions. New directions. And they want those on a regular schedule. Which means you need to schedule them. If you imagine your story is like a football game, then you need a major disaster at the end of the first quarter, and another one right at halftime, and another at the end of the third quarter.”

“But … why?” Goldilocks said. “Do you have to?”

Baby Bear shook his head. “You don’t have to do anything. But if you look at stories that work, stories that move people’s emotions, they’re often divided into four parts, with a major disaster between each part.”

The Big Bad Wolf raised his paw. “Like in Star Wars,” he said. “At the end of the first quarter, Luke’s aunt and uncle get killed by the stormtroopers and he decides to join Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Rebellion.”

“Right,” Baby Bear said. “Then at halftime, Obi-Wan Kenobi duels with Darth Vader using lightsabers, and Vader kills him. Now that’s a disaster, and it forces Luke to become his own man, to quit depending on his mentor.”

Goldilocks was starting to see it. “And then, when they get to the rebel planet, they learn that the Death Star has been tracking them, and it’s coming to destroy the rebel planet. So now they have to decide—will they run and hide, or stand and fight?”

Baby Bear nodded. “That’s an especially important decision. They decide to stand and fight, which means that there are only two possible endings. Either they are all going to die, or the Death Star will be destroyed. The third disaster forces the ending. It’s a beautifully structured story.”

Goldilocks felt skeptical. Baby Bear’s pattern worked for big, exciting stories with lots of explosions. But she didn’t think it would work for romance novels, and she read a lot of those. “There aren’t people getting shot in Pride and Prejudice,” she said.

The Big Bad Wolf laughed loudly at that. “She’s got you there, Baby Bear! From what I hear, Pride and Prejudice is one of those boring books where no planets explode, nobody gets killed, and there’s not even a lightsaber in sight. How can you have a disaster without any of those?”

Baby Bear frowned. “Pride and Prejudice is a romance story between Lizzie Bennet and Mr. Darcy, correct?”

Goldilocks nodded. “And a romance is simple. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl. So where are your three disasters? I only see one disaster—boy loses girl.”

The Big Bad Wolf shook his head sadly. “Baby Bear, your theory has more holes than a swiss cheese sandwich.”

Baby Bear reached into his backpack and pulled out an iPad. He tapped on it several times and began scanning the screen furiously, muttering to himself.

Goldilocks felt horrible. She was embarrassing poor Baby Bear in front of his class.

Finally Baby Bear looked up. “Very well, then. Right at the one-quarter mark in the story, Lizzie Bennet is talking to her good friend Mr. Wickham, and he tells her that Mr. Darcy financially ruined him for no good reason. What would you call that?”

“Boy loses girl,” Goldilocks said. “I’ll grant you that’s a disaster, but you need two more.”

Baby Bear flicked his paw across the screen, turning pages rapidly. “Halfway through the story, Mr. Darcy asks Lizzie to marry him. And she says …?”

Goldilocks felt her heart lurch. “She says that he is the last man she would ever be prevailed upon to marry.”

The Big Bad Wolf rubbed his large paws together. “Uh-oh! Did she use the F-word on him? Did she say, ‘forever?’ Because if she did, she means business. I haven’t read the story, but it sounds like boy loses girl permanently.”

Baby Bear kept flipping pages. “Turning to the end of the third quarter, Lizzie is just starting to get to know Mr. Darcy, and she realizes that he’s a pretty decent man, but then her sister Lydia runs off to live in sin with Mr. Wickham, who has turned out to be a liar and cheat. What would you call that?”

Goldilocks felt very small. “It sounds like another disaster. The worst one yet.”

“Yow! Sounds like girl loses boy this time,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “If Lizzie’s family has a scandal, Mr. Darcy can’t possibly marry her, right?”

Goldilocks shook her head. “You need to read more books, Big Bad Wolf. Yes, that’s a disaster, but it forces Mr. Darcy to do something kind and noble—he pays Mr. Wickham’s debts and makes him marry Lydia and so the family’s honor is restored. And he does it in secret, but Lizzie finds out and realizes that she’s been in love with him the whole time. And they live happily ever after.”

The Big Bad Wolf looked shocked. “Really? That sounds cool! I had no idea a book about dusty old people could be so … interesting.” He grabbed Baby Bear’s iPad and sat down in a corner and began reading.

Baby Bear looked at Goldilocks. “Now you know enough about story structure to work on the second step of the Snowflake for your story. You’ve got this American saboteur and he’s landed in the garden of a nice French woman and he’s broken his leg. She’s taking care of him. What goes wrong?”

Goldilocks thought for a second. “The mean old Nazi sympathizer comes to court our heroine and … sees the American soldier.”

“That’s a disaster,” Baby Bear said. “And what decision does she make? What’s going to change the course of the story?”

Goldilocks began jumping up and down. “She decides to protect the American. Up till now, she’s been terrified, thinking that she has to turn the American in to the Nazis. But when this awful man threatens to turn her in, she kills him right there. Then she and the American bury him in the yard.”

“That’s a good disaster and a huge decision,” Baby Bear said. “So now she’s committed to the story. It’s like when Luke joined the Rebellion in Star Wars. Once he does that, he can’t turn back. Your heroine can’t turn back either—she can’t unkill the collaborator.”

“But now it’s going to be horrible for her,” Goldilocks said. “People might find out she killed that man, and then she’ll be in real trouble.”

“That’s her problem, not yours,” Baby Bear said. “You have the opposite problem. What if nobody finds out she killed the collaborator?”

“Then … she’ll be fine and the American will be perfectly safe,” Goldilocks said.

“That’s bad,” Baby Bear said. “Horrible! You can’t leave your characters being safe. Safe is boring.”

Goldilocks shook her head. “You don’t understand, Baby Bear. She can’t do something stupid. She has to try to act as if nothing happened. She has to play safe. She has to protect her daughter.”

“Exactly,” Baby Bear said. “Your heroine naturally will try to play safe. But you, the novelist, will never play safe. What’s the worst thing in the world that could happen to your heroine?”

“The Nazis could take her daughter because she’s supposedly ‘defective.’”

“Perfect,” said Baby Bear. “That might just work as your second disaster. The Nazis could take her daughter. But explain to us why they think she’s ‘defective.’”

“She has Down syndrome. She’s eight years old, but she has the mind of a four-year-old.”

“Aha!” said Baby Bear. “And so she’s old enough to know about this American man in the house and about the collaborator who was killed, but she’s not old enough to be a good liar.”

Goldilocks sat down on the floor with her head in her hands. “This is horrible. My poor, poor heroine. She’s been trying so hard to be safe, and now the worst has happened.”

“No, this is wonderful,” Baby Bear said. “She’ll have to stop being safe and start doing scary things. What scary thing is she going to do first?”

Goldilocks felt like she was going to throw up. She imagined what she would do if the Nazis took her own daughter and were going to send her to a death camp. That would be too terrible for words. Tears sprang up in her eyes. “She’s going to … intercept the truck taking her daughter off to the concentration camp and kill the Nazis driving it and get her daughter back.”

“All alone?” said Baby Bear. “Won’t she need help?”

“She’s got this American man, and he’s become her lover, and he loves her daughter. He’ll help her. He’ll do anything for her. His lower leg is in a cast, but he can walk, and he has weapons.”

“So what’s the plan?” Baby Bear said. “This is promising, but they need a plan.”

“Well, I suppose they’ll set up an ambush for the truck and kill the driver and the soldiers and … rescue the daughter and live happily ever after.”

Baby Bear slumped to the floor with his head in his paws. “No, no, no. That’s too easy. And it’s too soon. You need another disaster. And isn’t D-Day coming?”

Goldilocks felt like her head was spinning. “Yes, it’s Saturday night, and our hero knows that D-Day will most likely be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.”

Baby Bear gave her an odd look. “They didn’t have D-Day all planned out months in advance?”

Goldilocks frowned at him. “You don’t know much about history, do you? The Allies needed moonlight at night for the paratroopers and a low tide at dawn for the attack. That gave them a three-day window in early June. They almost launched the invasion on Monday, but bad weather made them delay twenty-four hours.”

Baby Bear was grinning. “It sounds like you’ve done your homework on this.”

“Well, of course. But as I was saying, D-Day is almost upon them, and our hero hasn’t blown up the ammunition dump that he was supposed to. And now he can’t, because he has to help the heroine.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “You’re a novelist, Goldilocks. There’s no such thing as ‘can’t.’ Make it work.”

Goldilocks felt sweat sliding down her sides. “So they set up an ambush and kill the driver of the truck and the soldiers, but the American is wounded. Oh dear … I’m afraid he’s fatally wounded.” She shook her head and wiped her eyes. “This is horrible. What a terrible thing to happen.”

“A disaster?” Baby Bear said. “And how does that lead to an ending?”

“Well, now they have a truck and the American is in terrible pain, but he puts on the Nazi driver’s uniform and he and the heroine and the daughter drive to the ammo depot. He’s brought his explosives.”

“They have a frightening series of adventures along the way, I hope,” said Baby Bear.

“Oh yes, but the poor man is bleeding and the heroine is crying and the daughter has to do the driving part of the way. And they finally reach the place at 3:00 a.m., and I don’t know how they do it, but they get inside and blow it sky high.”

Baby Bear smiled. “You don’t have to know how they do it. That’s for you to figure out later. But that’s the ending. It’s a sad ending and a happy ending, mixed together. I think that might work.”

“That totally works,” said the Big Bad Wolf from the corner, where he was madly flipping pages on the iPad. “Lots of killing. Lots of kissing. Sounds like a howling good story to me.”

Baby Bear went to the whiteboard and found an empty space. “What we’ve learned is called the Three-Act Structure, although I sometimes like to call it the Three-Disaster Structure. Designing your Three-Act Structure is the second step of the Snowflake Method, and I like to do it in one paragraph of five sentences.” He wrote on the board:





YOUR ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY





Give yourself one hour for this task.

Write one paragraph with five sentences as follows: Explain the setting and introduce the lead characters.

Explain the first quarter of the book, up to the first disaster, where the hero commits to the story.

Explain the second quarter of the book, up to the second disaster, where the hero changes his mode of operations.

Explain the third quarter of the book, up to the third disaster, which forces the hero to commit to the ending.

Explain the fourth quarter of the book, where the hero has the final confrontation and either wins or loses or both.





Focus on the disasters and the decisions that follow.

Don’t try to figure out how you’ll solve all the problems. Leave that for later. You only care about the big picture in this step.





Below this, he wrote Goldilocks’s one-paragraph summary:





Ms. X is a young widow in Nazi-occupied France, and Mr. Y is an American saboteur who parachutes into her backyard and breaks his leg, three weeks before D-Day. Ms. X cares for Mr. Y and tries to decide whether to turn him in to the authorities, until the evil Mr. Z discovers them, and Ms. X is forced to kill him. Mr. Y helps Ms. X bury the body and she decides she must protect him, but then her ‘defective’ daughter is taken by the Nazis. Ms. X persuades Mr. Y to help ambush the transport, and they rescue her daughter, but Mr. Y has been fatally wounded. They drive the truck to the ammo depot, evading Nazis all the way, and blow it up just in the nick of time before the Allied invasion begins.





“How does that look?” Baby Bear said.

“I’d read that,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

Goldilocks studied it for a moment and saw that there was something very, very wrong with it.
