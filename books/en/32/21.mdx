How To Help the Author


A note from Goldilocks: “Word-of-mouth is the most powerful marketing force in the universe. If you enjoyed reading my adventures, I’d appreciate you rating this book and leaving a review. Even if you write only a sentence or two, it will help.”

About The Author


Randy Ingermanson got his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California at Berkeley. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis using the ideas in this book.

He’s been applying his knowledge of math to make the world a better place ever since.

Randy is a bit like Goldilocks, a bit like Baby Bear, and a bit like the Big Bad Wolf. He desperately hopes he’s not much like Little Pig, but you’d have to ask his friends.

Randy is the author of six award-winning novels and is well known around the world as “the Snowflake Guy.” He runs the Advanced Fiction Writing web site, and publishes the free monthly Advanced Fiction Writing E-zine, a wildly popular e-mail newsletter on fiction writing. He also blogs when the spirit moves him, and he’s the creator of Snowflake Pro, a software tool that makes the Snowflake Method fast, easy, and fun.

Standard Disclaimer


This is a “business parable”—a nonfiction teaching tool wickedly disguised as fiction. Names, characters, corporations, and government entities are either entirely imaginary or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, corporations, or government entities is just a coincidence and doesn't mean a blessed thing.





Acknowledgments


Thanks to Angie Hunt, whose question about “metaphors for writing your first draft” prompted me to dash out an analogy to the snowflake fractal back in the summer of 2002. And thanks to Janelle Schneider, the first person to see how amazingly popular the Snowflake Method would someday become.
