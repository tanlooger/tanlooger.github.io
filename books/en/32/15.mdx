title: Chapter 15 Goal, Conflict, Setback

GOLDILOCKS RACED DOWN the hallway, fumbling with her conference schedule. She scanned the day’s classes and found what she was looking for. Papa Bear was teaching a workshop on fairy tales in classroom 102B.

She burst into the room, breathing hard, her face feeling very flushed.

Papa Bear scowled at her. “Miss Goldilocks, what is the meaning—”

“Your cell phone!” she said. “Does it show a time stamp of when you called the police yesterday?”

“I’m sure it does, but—”

“Please, I need to see it!” she said. “I think it might prove the Big Bad Wolf is innocent.”

Papa Bear shook his head. “He’s not innocent. I performed the citizen’s arrest myself. He was washing his hands—probably getting the blood off.”

“Did you see any blood in the sink?”

Papa Bear thought for a moment. “No …”

“Did you see any blood on his fur?”

A long pause. “No …”

“Please, can you just show me on your phone what time you called the police?”

Papa Bear sighed. “You’re a very persistent young woman.” He pulled out his phone and pecked at the screen for several seconds. “Here it is. I made the call at exactly 9:43 a.m. But I don’t see what good that does you.”

“It gives us a time stamp,” Goldilocks said. “If it’s before the murder of Little Pig …”

Papa Bear just looked at her.

Goldilocks suddenly realized that she wasn’t thinking straight. Papa Bear had arrested the Big Bad Wolf after he found Little Pig dead. A time stamp after the murder was no use. She shook her head. “I’m sorry. I must be very stupid. I just thought …”

A young woman in Papa Bear’s class began whispering to the older woman next to her. They both smirked and gawked at Goldilocks.

Goldilocks wanted to die of embarrassment. But that wouldn’t help the Big Bad Wolf. She had to keep trying. “Please, can you tell me exactly what time you found Little Pig dead in the coffee shop?”

Papa Bear’s huge bushy eyebrows knitted together. Finally, he began fishing in his wallet. “It won’t do you any good, but I have my receipt for the coffee I bought just before I found Little Pig. It’s a business expense, and … yes, here it is.”

Goldilocks inspected the receipt closely. “You bought the coffee at 9:35 a.m. That was eight minutes before you caught the Big Bad Wolf in the men’s room. What did you do after you bought the coffee?”

Papa Bear shrugged. “I went straight out the side door into the back patio and saw Little Pig lying there in a pool of blood. I ran back inside the coffee shop and told the barista to call an ambulance. Then I ran back outside and checked Little Pig for any signs of life. He was clearly dead. There were some wolf prints in the dirt right nearby. I came out of the back patio through that arch in the hedge and looked in all directions for signs of the killer. There was nobody in the parking lot. I went back to the patio and asked myself where I would go if my paws were bloody.”

“Did you see any other tracks?” Goldilocks said.

Papa Bear shook his head. “Just Little Pig’s own hoofprints in a small muddy patch beside his body. But I had a hunch, so I went into the main building and checked the men’s room. And there was the Big Bad Wolf, washing his paws. I performed a citizen’s arrest and called the police.”

“So all of that happened in a span of eight minutes,” said Goldilocks. “And Little Pig was already dead at 9:35, when you bought the coffee?”

“I’m sure,” said Papa Bear. “I took the coffee straight to the patio, and there he was.”

Goldilocks nodded. It wasn’t enough information, but it was something.

Papa Bear looked at his watch.

Goldilocks took the hint and said “Thank you,” and backed out into the hallway. She felt horribly discouraged. The idea of time stamps had made a lot of sense when Baby Bear said it, but now she couldn’t see that it had got her anywhere.

“Everything okay?” Robin Hood called from down the hall.

Goldilocks shook her head. She didn’t know what to do next. She had promised the Big Bad Wolf she would help, but so far, she hadn’t done a thing except make a fool of herself.

“Want to go get some coffee?” Robin Hood said when she reached him. “Because you are, like, one amazing wench, and—”

“Leave me alone!” Goldilocks shouted. “And stop calling me a wench. Nobody calls women wenches anymore. It’s rude and disrespectful.”

Robin Hood looked shocked. “Really? I’m sorry—”

“Don’t be sorry. Just … grow up.” Goldilocks walked past Robin Hood as fast as she could. She strode down the hall, past the main auditorium, past Baby Bear’s classroom.

Down at the end of the hall was a sign that said “Conference Director.”

Goldilocks didn’t know what the director could tell her, but it would be worth trying. She opened the door and stepped in.

The office was empty. It was a small room with three large gray metal office desks against the far wall. Several computers hummed on the desks.

And in the middle of the third desk was an expensive digital camera.

Goldilocks felt her heart double-thump.

She picked up the camera and studied it.

Then she heard voices from the next office, which connected to this one through a doorway.

Terrified, Goldilocks ran out of the office, stuffing the camera into her purse.

The hallway was empty, but she heard voices behind her in the director’s office.

Goldilocks ran.

She ran all the way back down the long hall and out into the bright morning sunlight.

She kept running until she reached the coffee shop. Somebody was inside, so she ducked around to the back patio and sat under the shade of a large umbrella in the far corner and laid her purse carefully on the table. She looked all around. It was quiet and secluded here. The tall hedge protected her from the view of people in the conference center.

Goldilocks took out the camera and turned it on and began scrolling through the images.

The most recent were pictures of the Big Bad Wolf being pushed into the police car. Then pictures of Papa Bear. Pictures of Mama Bear and Baby Bear watching the police. There were several pictures of herself.

Goldilocks frowned. Her hair looked horribly windblown. She really needed to do something—

“What have you got there?” said a voice.

Goldilocks looked up, and nearly fainted.

A young pig stood there—looking very much like Little Pig, only smaller. He was wearing a high-quality sport jacket, but no tie or pants or anything else.

“Oh!” Goldilocks said. “Who are y-you?”

“I’m Tiny Pig. My uncle was murdered here yesterday. I flew in this morning to get some answers.”

“I’m so sorry about your loss,” Goldilocks said. “Your uncle was in my writing class, so I knew him just a little bit. I’m looking for answers too, and I’m hoping that I’ve found them.”

Tiny Pig’s eyebrows leaped up. “R-really? What have you learned?”

Goldilocks held up the camera. “I … um, borrowed this from the conference photographer. He took some pictures yesterday, and I think … well, I’m hoping there are some clues here.”

“May I join you?” Tiny Pig’s jowls were quivering. “My uncle was my only living relative. We were very close.”

Goldilocks pulled up a chair next to hers. “Have a seat and we can look together.”

Tiny Pig sat next to her. His whole body seemed to be rippling with nervous energy.

Goldilocks could only imagine how awful he felt. She continued scrolling through the images. There were shots of the police cars after they had arrived.

The next shot was in Baby Bear’s classroom, with Goldilocks and Baby Bear looking at each other wearing fake smiles.

Goldilocks felt her breath coming in little gasps. She scrolled rapidly, looking, looking …

There!

The photographer had taken one shot that showed most of the room.

Clearly visible in the far corner was the Big Bad Wolf, fast asleep.

“The time stamp for this is 9:39!” said Goldilocks. “That proves it!”

Tiny Pig peered at the screen. “Proves what?”

“This was taken four minutes after Papa Bear found your uncle dead,” Goldilocks said. “This proves the Big Bad Wolf didn’t murder him. This is wonderful news!”

Tiny Pig jumped up. “Oh, my word!” He pressed his right front hoof to his heart. His face had gone pale and damp. “The Big Bad Wolf … not the murderer?”

“Exactly! We’ve discovered the proof!” Goldilocks said. “We’ve got to tell the conference director. This means the murderer is still out and about somewhere. We might be in danger. Especially you.”

Tiny Pig’s jowls were working, and he seemed to be having trouble breathing. “Oh, my word! Miss, I feel faint. Can you help me?”

“I’ll call an ambulance.” Goldilocks reached for her purse to get her phone.

“Don’t you dare!” Tiny Pig pulled a small syringe out of the breast pocket of his jacket and pointed it straight at her.
