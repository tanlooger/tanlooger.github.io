title: Chapter 7 Your Story in One Page
---

THE NEXT MORNING, Goldilocks took her laptop to the conference and arrived very early. She was the first student in Baby Bear’s classroom and waited impatiently, wondering where Baby Bear was. Didn’t he know that she wanted to show him her work? This was important!

Ten minutes before the workshop was due to begin, Baby Bear walked in. He was wearing a large backpack, which he barely had time to take off before Goldilocks was at the front table with her laptop.

“Look at all this that I wrote last night!”

Baby Bear scrolled through the document. “Let’s see here. Your heroine … very nice, you’ve got a whole page here. I see she has two Values.”

“I spent a lot of time on her Values,” Goldilocks said. “Nothing is more important than her daughter, Monique. And nothing is more important than having a man who loves her.”

Baby Bear stared off into space. “Tell me more about this man Henri who’s been courting her.”

“He’s awful,” Goldilocks said at once. “He’s got loads of money because he’s a Nazi collaborator.”

“It sounds like he loves Elise quite a lot.”

“He just wants to get her into bed.”

“That’s all he wants? To get her into bed just one time?”

“No, silly. He wants to marry her.”

“That sounds like love to me.”

Goldilocks sighed loudly. “I suppose.”

“And if he’s got money, wouldn’t he be able to help Elise care for Monique?”

“Yes, probably. So?”

“Elise has two Values,” Baby Bear said. “Nothing is more important than caring for her daughter, Monique. And nothing is more important than having a man who loves her. It seems like Henri fits both of those perfectly. If Elise married him, that ought to make her very happy.”

Goldilocks stared at Baby Bear, wondering how he could be so unromantic. Bears probably didn’t do romance. And anyway, Baby Bear didn’t look old enough to be having relationships. He was really a very young and inexperienced bear.

Baby Bear kept studying her. “Why doesn’t Elise just marry Henri?”

“Because … he’s awful! He’s bald and fat and … he collaborates with the Nazis!”

Baby Bear scanned the document. “I don’t see any Values here that say that desirable men are hairy and muscular and fight in the Resistance.”

“But … those are obvious!” Goldilocks shouted. “Nobody wants a man who’s bald and fat and kills innocent people. Honestly, you really don’t have much sense, do—”

“There she goes, making assumptions again,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

Goldilocks spun around and glared at him. “Where did you come from? And who asked your opinion?”

“You did, when you said that nobody wants bald, fat men who kill innocent people. Well, I can tell you that a bald man is less trouble to eat than a hairy one. And if he’s fat, he’s much more tender and juicy. And as far as killing innocent people, if you ask me, humans aren’t innocent at all—the way they’re ruining the planet and driving other species to extinction. So—”

“Go away!” Goldilocks shouted. “What a horrible person you are!”

“Wolf. Not person, wolf. And by the way, you look particularly scrumptious when you’re angry.”

“You’re impossible!” Goldilocks said. “You shouldn’t make jokes like that.”

The Big Bad Wolf didn’t say anything.

Goldilocks wondered if he might not be joking.

“Peace!” Baby Bear said, stepping between Goldilocks and the Big Bad Wolf. “Let’s stay focused, shall we? My point is that Goldilocks hasn’t spelled out Elise’s Values fully yet. It sounds like Elise doesn’t want to be loved by just any man. He needs to be young and handsome.”

“Well, of course, that’s obvious.”

“It’s obvious to Elise, but not necessarily to everybody,” said Baby Bear. “That’s the problem with Values—they aren’t always obvious. An old woman might prefer a bald, fat man her own age who is great at conversation, rather than a young, handsome, narcissistic man who only talks to beautiful young women.”

“Very well, I’ll fix that Value so it’s clearer,” Goldilocks said grumpily.

“And furthermore, Elise apparently believes that collaborating with the Nazis is evil.”

“Well, of course, that’s, um …” Goldilocks sighed.

“Obvious?” said Baby Bear. “And yet millions of people collaborated with the Nazis. Apparently, resisting Nazis wasn’t a Value for everybody.”

“Those people had a Value that nothing is more important than staying alive,” Goldilocks said. “But everybody knows that. It’s … obvious.”

“You keep saying that, even though it isn’t.” Baby Bear kept reading. “It sounds like you may have a few more Values to add to Elise’s list. But the rest of the class is here, and we need to get started.”

Goldilocks noticed that the room had filled with other students. She closed her laptop and looked for a seat, but almost all the seats were taken. There was only one empty chair left, in the second row, but it was next to the Big Bad Wolf. She took the chair, but made a point of scooting as far away from him as possible.

He grinned at her and licked his lips.

Baby Bear rapped his paws on the front table for attention. “Today, we’ll be talking about the next step in the Snowflake Method—the one-page synopsis.”

“Yuck!” Goldilocks said. “I hate synopses! I already tried to write one of those, and it was horrible. Boring. There was this old bear yesterday who was teaching how to write a synopsis. But it didn’t work for me.”

“Yes, well, it works for my dad,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks’s mouth fell open. “Papa Bear is your … father?”

“That’s what Mama Bear says, and she would know.”

“Mama Bear is your mother?”

“I would have thought that was obvious,” Baby Bear said with a huge grin. “Perhaps you’ll agree me with me that what’s obvious to one person isn’t obvious to another. But back to the tangent. Today, we’ll learn to write a one-page synopsis, and you’ll find that it’s now very easy.”

Goldilocks folded her arms across her chest. She knew writing a synopsis was boring. She had already tried it. She wondered if maybe she could play hooky for this workshop until Baby Bear returned to something more interesting.

“Some of you are thinking that synopses are boring,” Baby Bear said.

A blush crept up Goldilocks’s cheeks.

“And you’re right. Synopses are the most boring writing you will ever do. But they’re necessary if you ever want to sell a book to a traditional publisher, because they all insist on receiving a synopsis as part of your proposal. You can’t get an agent without having a brilliant synopsis.”

Goldilocks felt like her stomach was filled with lead. This fiction-writing business was hard work.

“Our goal today is to find a way to write a strong synopsis quickly and painlessly,” said Baby Bear. “We’re already most of the way there.”

The Big Bad Wolf yawned noisily.

Goldilocks shot him a disgusted look.

“We’ve already seen how to write a one-paragraph summary of your story,” said Baby Bear. “Now just take each sentence of that paragraph and expand it into a paragraph of its own. You have five sentences. Expanding each of those will give you five paragraphs, which add up to a page. That’s all.”

Goldilocks couldn’t believe it. That sounded too simple. There had to be a catch.

“I see that most of you brought laptops,” said Baby Bear. “Writing a synopsis ought to take you about an hour. I’d like you to take twenty minutes right now to write the first two paragraphs. At the end of the twenty minutes, we’ll read some of them aloud. The best example will get a prize, which I’ll explain a bit later.”

Goldilocks desperately wanted to win that prize. She suspected it would be writing related. Perhaps an endorsement from Baby Bear. Perhaps an introduction to an excellent agent.

The Big Bad Wolf scratched his armpit. “Good luck, Blondie,” he stage-whispered.

Goldilocks flipped open her laptop and began typing furiously. She didn’t need luck. And she was sick to death of the Big Bad Wolf and his bad manners.

The twenty minutes passed in a flash. Goldilocks finished her second paragraph just before Baby Bear called time.

“Who wants to read their work?” Baby Bear asked.

Goldilocks flung her hand in the air.

So did every other writer in the room.

Baby Bear chose a bald, chubby, middle-aged man near the back.

The man stood up and read his two paragraphs. They were beautiful and flawless. The man was writing a literary novel set in New York, and his synopsis sang with power.

Goldilocks wanted to shrink into the floor. She could never write like that.

The Big Bad Wolf leaned toward her and whispered, “Beautiful writing, but no story. There’s no there there.”

“Who’s next?” Baby Bear said.

Again, dozens of hands shot up.

Baby Bear chose an older woman to read. She was chubby, with frowzy hair, and Goldilocks thought her makeup seemed very poorly done. She was writing erotica, and her first two paragraphs were extremely steamy.

Goldilocks felt her cheeks burning. She couldn’t believe people would write that sort of thing, much less read it in public.

The Big Bad Wolf said in a shocked whisper, “Is that even possible for a human?”

When Baby Bear asked for the next volunteer, Goldilocks again raised her hand, but she seemed to be invisible to Baby Bear.

After several writers had read their work, Goldilocks began getting frustrated. She didn’t have a chance.

Something tapped her on the shoulder. Something warm and furry. A wolfish paw.

Goldilocks tried to ignore it.

The paw kept tapping insistently.

Finally, she turned to glare at the Big Bad Wolf.

He leaned toward her. “Want me to get Baby Bear’s attention?”

Part of Goldilocks wanted to tell him to go jump off a cliff. But part of her thought that he might really be able to help. She felt so desperate, she gave a little nod.

After the next writer finished reading, Baby Bear said, “Who’s next?”

The Big Bad Wolf stood up and waved both his paws. “Yo! Over here! Blondie wants to read her stuff real bad! You listening to me, Baby Bear?”

Goldilocks wanted to die. How could the Big Bad Wolf humiliate her like that?

Baby Bear smiled. “Ah, it looks like you two have made up. Very good. Please read the beginning of your synopsis, Goldilocks.”

Goldilocks stood up and began reading:

“It’s May of 1944, and the Allies are desperate to destroy a crucial ammunition dump before D-Day. They train half a dozen commandos to parachute behind enemy lines, armed with guns and explosives. But the plane is nearly destroyed by anti-aircraft fire, and only one commando gets out of the plane alive. Dirk Steele parachutes into France, landing in the garden of a house in a small village twenty kilometers from the target. In the darkness, he lands badly and breaks his ankle.”

Goldilocks paused for breath.

The entire room had gone very quiet.

“The garden is owned by Elise Renoir, a young French widow who has an eight-year-old daughter named Monique, who has Down syndrome. Elise is terrified that the Nazis will take her away because she’s ‘defective.’ Elise longs to fight in the Resistance. She is not afraid to die, but if she were killed, what would happen to her daughter? When she discovers Dirk unconscious in her garden, Elise knows that the safe thing would be to turn him in to the Nazis, but she can’t. So she hides him in her root cellar and sets his broken ankle in a makeshift cast. For a week, Elise wrestles with her conscience. Elise has a suitor whom she hates, a bald, middle-aged collaborator named Henri. When Henri comes to court Elise and discovers Dirk, Elise kills him and buries him in her garden.”

Goldilocks stopped. “That’s all I have so far.”

The room burst into applause.

Baby Bear was jumping up and down with excitement. “Superb! That was excellent. Your first paragraph gave us the big picture. You set the time, the place, and the stakes, which are very high. You also introduced the love interest, Dirk, and gave him a problem. Then in the second paragraph, you introduced your lead character, Elise, gave her two problems—her daughter and her unsuitable suitor—and ended with a disaster. Very soon, the villagers will be wondering what happened to Henri. Elise is committed now. Bravo!”

Goldilocks was glowing with pride. She had done it! She had written at least part of a synopsis that wasn’t boring.

“I think we have a winner,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

Goldilocks spun her head to look at him. “I … thought Baby Bear was going to pick the winner.”

The Big Bad Wolf produced a business card from somewhere in his mangy fur. He handed it to Goldilocks. “The prize is a one-hour appointment with me.”

His card read: The Big Bad Wolf Literary Agency. It had an address in New York City.

Goldilocks was suddenly finding it hard to breathe. The Big Bad Wolf was an agent? From New York?

“Let’s have lunch,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “You interest me.”

Baby Bear clapped his paws in delight. “Excellent! Goldilocks, you may not know it, but the Big Bad Wolf is a very good agent. He’s young and hungry, and he’s a tough negotiator with the editors. I suppose it’s his big teeth or his sharp claws.”

“It’s my roguish good looks.” The Big Bad Wolf ran his paws through his ragged fur.

Goldilocks shivered. What was her husband going to say when he heard that she was having lunch with such a shady character?

The Big Bad Wolf licked his lips. “Do you like pork ribs?”

“Y-yes,” Goldilocks said.

“I suppose you don’t like them raw.”

“Um, barbecued.”

His face fell. “Well, I suppose that’s second best. I know a place, if you don’t mind driving over to the rough side of town. It’s just a little hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the ribs are said to be excellent.”

Goldilocks felt a rush of fear in her belly. This was starting to sound just a bit scary.

Baby Bear rang a little bell on his desk. “It’s time for our morning break. We’ll meet back here in fifteen minutes to work on step 5 in the Snowflake Method.”
