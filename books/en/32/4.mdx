title: Chapter 4 Your Creative Paradigm
---

GOLDILOCKS HAD NEVER felt so disappointed. She had worked very hard on her one-sentence summary. She felt in her heart that it was a good one. But it had taken a whole hour to write it. And she just didn’t think she could stand writing the entire novel so slowly.

“Are you okay, Goldilocks?” Baby Bear said. “You don’t look happy.”

“I just …” Goldilocks put her head in her hands. “I don’t know what you’re doing, but it doesn’t seem to be working. We’ve only got one sentence, and there are thousands more to write. We’ll never get done at this rate.”

Baby Bear started laughing. “Are you kidding? There are ten steps to writing a novel, and you’ve already finished the first one—and it only took an hour. You’re doing wonderfully.”

Goldilocks looked at the one sentence on the whiteboard. “I don’t understand. You’re telling me we’re already a tenth of the way there? That can’t be right.”

Little Pig jabbed a hoof at Baby Bear. “You obviously don’t know anything about writing. How many novels have you published, young bear?”

Baby Bear shrugged. “Half a dozen.”

“Well, I’ve never heard of any of them.” Little Pig peered at him through his wire-framed spectacles.

“There are millions of books in print, and hundreds of thousands of authors,” Baby Bear said. “How many of those novels have you read, and how many authors can you name?”

Little Pig harrumphed. “I don’t waste my time reading fiction, and—”

“And yet you want to write a novel?” Baby Bear said.

“Reading and writing are two different things,” Little Pig said. “In any event, I don’t have time to write the novel myself. I’ve worked out the story. I just need some clerical type to put it down on paper. Writers are a dime a dozen.”

Goldilocks was getting rather tired of Little Pig. She stood up to her full height and glared at him. “Writing is skilled work, and if you think you can just hire a writer like you’d hire a gardener, then maybe your head isn’t on straight. Now, if you don’t mind, the rest of us came here to learn from Baby Bear, so why don’t you sit down and listen?”

The whole class erupted in cheers.

Little Pig’s face turned a bright pink. He spluttered and coughed and then sat down.

Baby Bear put his paw up to scratch his nose, but it didn’t quite conceal the huge grin on his face. “We’re overdue to talk about creative paradigms. Some of you have tried outlining your novel. How did that work out for you?”

A young man in the back raised his hand. “Outlining works pretty well for me.”

The hipster woman next to him scowled furiously. “Outlining is horrible! It crushes the human spirit. You might just as well do a paint-by-numbers, because you aren’t going to create great art by outlining.”

Baby Bear held up his paws. “Peace, people. Outlining is a method that’s proven to work for many authors. Many of you probably liked The Bourne Identity. The author of the novel, Robert Ludlum, was famous for his long and detailed outlines.”

Goldilocks was trembling. “But … I tried outlining and it didn’t work.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “You tried it and it didn’t work for you. Outlining is one example of what I call a ‘creative paradigm.’ It’s a method for helping you write your first draft, and it works for some people. However, it doesn’t work for everybody.”

Goldilocks sighed deeply. She desperately needed a creative paradigm that worked for her.

“Another well-known creative paradigm is seat-of-the-pants writing,” Baby Bear said. “You just sit down and write your novel with no idea where you’re going. How many of you have tried that?”

The hipster woman in back said, “If you ask me, that’s the only way you’re going to get great art. You let your story well up from your inmost being.”

The young man next to her gave a sneer. “That’s just a load of crap. Which is about what you’d expect to well up from your inmost being.”

The woman’s face turned a brilliant red, and she looked like she was going to explode.

“Please,” Baby Bear said in a calming tone. “Seat-of-the-pants writing is another example of a creative paradigm, and it works wonderfully well for some authors. Stephen King is a famous seat-of-the-pants writer. But again, it doesn’t work for everybody.”

Goldilocks couldn’t stand it any longer. “Why don’t you quit beating around the bush? You’ve got your own creative paradigm and it works for everybody, so let’s just hear it, shall we?”

Baby Bear shook his head. “Well, that’s just the problem. I’ve got a creative paradigm that works well for me, and for tens of thousands of other writers, but it doesn’t work for everybody. There isn’t any creative paradigm that works for everybody. What I’m trying to explain is that you will each have to find the creative paradigm that works best for you, and then ignore all the others.”

“But … hadn’t you better get started?” Goldilocks said. “You’ve wasted all this time teaching us about our target audience and our one-sentence summary. When are you going to teach us your creative paradigm?”

“Actually, we’re well under way,” Baby Bear said. “My creative paradigm is called the Snowflake Method, and you’ve completed the first step—writing the one-sentence summary. There are only ten steps, and we’re ready to work on step 2. But first, who knows why it’s called the Snowflake Method?”

Nobody said anything.

“I suppose I’ll have to show you.” Baby Bear tapped the power switch on the PowerPoint projector on the table.

The back wall lit up, showing the display on his laptop. The only thing on the screen was a large image of a snowflake:





Baby Bear tugged Goldilocks to the whiteboard and handed her a marker. “I want you to draw that picture of a snowflake in one continuous stroke—without lifting the marker or erasing.”

Goldilocks studied the image. “I can’t. That’s too hard. I could never do that. It’s impossible. However did you draw that?”

Baby Bear grinned. “Actually, I didn’t. I wrote a computer program to draw that.”

“Well, it’s incredibly complicated! It must be a very long program.”

“No, it’s a very short program, and it uses exactly the same procedure that a human or a bear can use to draw that image. Let me show you how it works.” Baby Bear took a marker and drew three straight lines on the whiteboard to make a triangle.





“That doesn’t look a bit like a snowflake,” Goldilocks said. “You aren’t anywhere near done yet.”

“I didn’t say I was done.” Baby Bear erased the central third of each of the straight lines and added the two edges for each of three smaller triangles so that he now had a six-pointed star.





Goldilocks put her hands on her hips. “It still doesn’t look much like a snowflake. And anyway, you cheated. You lifted your marker and you erased lines.”

Baby Bear just looked at her. “Who said I couldn’t erase lines or lift my marker?”

“You did.” Goldilocks turned to the class. “Didn’t he say I couldn’t erase the lines?”

Everybody nodded.

Baby Bear chortled. “And you believed me? Just because I said you had to do it that way, you believed me? Even though it makes it harder, you just accepted that you should do it that way?”

Goldilocks didn’t know what to say, so she just glared at him.

Baby Bear hopped up on the table next to his laptop and pointed at the class. “This is important, you novelists! You’re going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel. But that’s all it is. Advice. If you don’t like that advice, if it doesn’t work for you, then ignore it. If it does work for you, then run with it.”

“But …” Goldilocks spluttered. “These teachers at the conference know what they’re talking about, don’t they?”

“They know what works for them,” Baby Bear said. “But they don’t know what works for you. If they advise you to write an outline like Robert Ludlum and it doesn’t work for you, then what do you do?”

“Um … cry?” Goldilocks said.

“No! Ignore the advice!” Baby Bear’s furry little face was turning red. “And if they advise you to write seat-of-the-pants like Stephen King and it doesn’t work for you, then what do you do?”

“But … that’s supposed to be ‘organic,’” Goldilocks said. “How can ‘organic’ be wrong?”

Baby Bear began hopping up and down in rage. “Organic?” he bellowed. “What a load of nonsense! There’s nothing organic about seat-of-the-pants writing! It’s a method of writing. It works for some great writers. It doesn’t work for other great writers. So what do you do if it doesn’t work for you?”

“Find something that does?” Goldilocks said.

“Exactly.” Baby Bear grabbed the marker and went back to the whiteboard. “If you’re a great artist, you can draw this snowflake seat-of-the-pants with one continuous motion, never erasing. But very few people are great artists. They can draw something in one continuous motion, but it’s going to come out all warped and lopsided, and they’re going to have to erase huge pieces of it and keep trying over and over, until they get it right.”

“Don’t great writers write dozens and dozens of drafts of their novel until they get it right?” Goldilocks said.

Baby Bear laughed. “Yes, if they’re seat-of-the-pants writers. They have to. But Snowflakers don’t. Just let me finish drawing my snowflake, and you’ll see why.”

He erased smaller pieces from each of the straight lines on his six-pointed star. Then he added in smaller triangles.





Goldilocks thought it was finally starting to look like a snowflake. It wasn’t finished, but she could see where it was going.

Baby Bear did another round of changes, and now it was really looking like a snowflake.





He did one more round, and then he stepped back. “How does it look?”





Goldilocks gasped. “It looks … perfect.”

“It’s perfect at each stage, but it’s always incomplete,” Baby Bear said. “You can keep going like that forever. This is a mathematical object called a snowflake fractal, and you can prove that the length of its perimeter is infinite.”

“But after you’ve done a few of those rounds, it’s as good as you can get with that thick marker you’re using,” Goldilocks said. “Once the length of each edge is less than the width of the marker, making more changes won’t help.”

“Exactly!” Baby Bear said. “But notice this. The first round of revisions was very simple. I erased parts of three edges and drew in a few lines. The second round was a little more complicated. The third round was more complicated yet.”

“But at every stage, it was nice and symmetrical,” Goldilocks said. “It was perfect, but not finished.”

Baby Bear smiled. “If I had drawn this ‘organically,’ it would never be perfect at any stage. And I’d always be making huge fixes to different parts of it.”

“That’s really dumb,” Goldilocks said. “Who would draw it that way?”

“What you mean is that it would be dumb for you,” Baby Bear said. “Because it makes sense to you to draw it the way I just showed you. But a seat-of-the-pants artist would hate drawing it my way.”

“Then … who’s right?” Goldilocks asked. “What’s the one best way of drawing the snowflake?”

“The one that works for you,” Baby Bear said. “And what did I tell you about the different methods of writing a novel?”

“Always use the method of writing that works for you,” Goldilocks said.

“Exactly.” Baby Bear put the marker down and dusted his paws. “Now are you ready for the second stage of the Snowflake Method of writing a novel?”

Goldilocks shook her head. “It just sounds too simple. You make it sound like anybody could write a novel. That can’t be right. Creating great art should be painful. Everybody knows that.”

Baby Bear’s phone buzzed. He took it out, read a text message, then tapped on it for a few seconds and put it away. “Well, Goldilocks, you’ve tried outlining, and it didn’t work for you. You’ve tried seat-of-the-pants writing, and it didn’t work for you. What do you have to lose by trying the Snowflake Method?”

Goldilocks was getting rather tired of Baby Bear’s logical approach to everything.

The door suddenly flew open with a tremendous bang.

A large, evil-looking wolf wearing a mask rushed into the room. He pointed a huge handgun at Baby Bear and fired.

Baby Bear grabbed his chest.

Blood squirted out.

Goldilocks screamed.

Baby Bear fell to the floor and lay still.
