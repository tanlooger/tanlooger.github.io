title: Chapter 12 Your Character Bible
---

DURING THE BREAK, Goldilocks hurried down the hall to the snack table and got a banana and a cup of tea. She smiled at the young man with the bow and arrows. “What sort of novel are you writing?”

He gave her a confident grin. “It’s a collection of tales about a band of merry outlaws living in the forest, shooting wild deer and drinking ale and kissing wenches and evading the local sheriff.”

“Well, good luck on that …” Goldilocks peered at his name tag. “… um, Robin. Your story sounds awesome.”

He shrugged modestly. “Your story is pretty epic, too. I hope Baby Bear puts you on the hot seat again. I learn, like, loads about writing every time he gets you up there.” His eyes flicked down to her chest for a moment, and a sloppy smile played across his face. “And you look like a wench who likes to have fun. If you ever want to hang out in the forest—”

“Oh, my!” Goldilocks pointed to her watch. “Look at the time. We’d better get back to our workshop.”

When they reached the classroom, the Big Bad Wolf was curled up on the floor in the back corner of the classroom, snoring gently.

Precisely on time, Baby Bear rapped on the front table. “Step 7 in the Snowflake Method is to write up a character bible for each of your characters. You can do this however it works best for you. Some authors like to start by finding pictures on the Internet that resemble their characters. If that helps you visualize your character, then do it. But let’s remember the most important thing. You want to know enough about your characters so that you can get inside their skins.”

Baby Bear passed out sheets of paper with a large number of questions.

Robin looked at his and started snickering. “Why do I need to know what color my hero’s eyes are?”

Goldilocks couldn’t believe he could be so ignorant. “That’s important! You can tell a lot about a character from the color of his eyes.”

Robin laughed out loud. “What can you tell about me?”

She studied him. “Your eyes are all red and bloodshot. I bet you drink loads of ale and stay out too late at night chasing loose women.”

“Wenches,” he said. “Not loose women. Wenches.”

Goldilocks sniffed. “Same difference.”

Baby Bear cleared his throat. “You’re both missing an important point here. All too many books show the heroine with blue eyes on page 1 and green eyes on page 99. One purpose of your character bible is to give you a place to save all the little details about each character—so you don’t make mistakes like that.”

“Who would be so stupid?” asked Goldilocks.

“It happens all the time,” said Baby Bear.

“Why can’t you just remember that sort of thing?”

“When it’s 3:00 a.m. on the day your book is due to your editor, and you’re reading the proofs one last time to be sure it’s perfect, you’ll be very glad you have one central place where you can look up what year the village postmistress was born.”

Goldilocks frowned. “Has that ever happened to you?”

“Every book,” Baby Bear said. “It’s nice to be able to find it in one minute, not ten.”

“There’s nothing in your list of questions about what kind of nail polish my heroine wears,” said Goldilocks.

“Heavens!” said Mrs. Hubbard. “Who can afford nail polish?”

Robin snickered. “More important, who would wear it? That is, like, the most shallow question I can imagine.”

“Nail polish is important!” Goldilocks said. “It says a lot about your character.”

Robin scoffed. “Tell me what brand of ale a man drinks, and I’ll tell you whether he’s a good man or a lackey of the Sheriff of Nottingham. That’s the important thing.”

“Speaking of shallow,” Goldilocks said.

Baby Bear held up his paws. “Peace, people! If you look at the questions on this list, you’ll see some that seem useful to you and some that don’t. If a question simply doesn’t apply to your character, then ignore it. If there are other questions not on the list that would help you understand your characters better, then add them.”

“It seems like loads of work,” said Robin.

“It is a lot of work,” said Baby Bear. “I often take a full working day for each of my main characters. But it’s time well spent. I suggest we put Goldilocks on the hot seat and quiz her a bit about some of her characters.”

The room began buzzing with excitement.

Goldilocks went up to the front and sat on the hot seat. She knew that this wasn’t going to be easy, but she also knew it would be valuable.

Baby Bear studied Goldilocks for a moment. “Part of your novel takes place in Elise’s home. Describe it.”

She stared at him. “But … aren’t all houses pretty much alike?”

“Suppose you tell me what your house is like,” said Baby Bear.

Goldilocks frowned. “I’m sure it’s just like anyone else’s. It’s a nice three-bedroom house on a sixth-of-an-acre lot. The exterior is stucco and the roof is tile, and there’s an attached two-car garage. The windows are triple-paned—”

“That’s not a house, that’s a prison,” said Robin. “Goldilocks, you have, like, totally subjugated yourself to the Man.”

“Robin, tell us about your house,” Baby Bear said.

He shrugged. “It’s a cave out in Sherwood Forest. I live there with my band of merry men. There’s no windows to keep in the smoke when we roast the wild deer we poached from the sheriff’s lands. Nothing artificial. We are, like, the original Thoreau. It’s awesome!”

“Is the cupboard bare?” asked Mrs. Hubbard. “That’s what my house is like, and I think it’s just fascinating.”

Robin Hood shook his head. “We don’t have cupboards, but our cook fires are never bare. If you want a little excitement, you can come check us out. And bring some of your wench friends.”

Mrs. Hubbard’s cheeks turned pink, and she giggled. “I might just do that, young man. I’ll bring my granddaughter, Marian. I think she’s exactly your type.” She looked at Baby Bear. “What is your house like, young bear?”

Baby Bear didn’t say anything.

“I’ll bet it’s a rustic little thatched cottage far out in the woods,” said Goldilocks. “With a wooden table and three wooden bowls for porridge. And three wooden chairs. And upstairs, three beds—one too hard, one too soft, and one just right.”

Baby Bear gave her a curious look. “How would you know all that?”

Goldilocks felt her cheeks turning hot. “Oh! Was I right? I was, you know, just guessing.”

“You have … quite an imagination.” Baby Bear looked like he wanted to say something else, but then he shook his head. “So I want you to apply that imagination to your character, Elise. What is her house like?”

Goldilocks was glad to get back to Elise. “Well, of course it has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. There’s a nice quiet study upstairs for Elise to write her novels. And there’s a kitchen on the first floor with a lovely marble countertop and a huge cooking island right in the center.”

Mrs. Hubbard began laughing. “Dearie, what planet are you living on? Nobody had a house like that in the 1940s.”

“They … didn’t?” Goldilocks said. “Well, I suppose Elise’s house would be smaller. Two bedrooms and one bath, then.”

Mrs. Hubbard just shook her head. “Honey, you need to do a little research. Your character lives in a little village in France in 1944. Are you sure they even have a bathroom in the house? And whatever happened to the parlor?”

“Parlor?” Goldilocks said. “Why would they have a parlor and not a bathroom?”

“Oh, mercy, you have some homework to do,” said the old woman. “You need to look at pictures of actual houses from that time and place. See what we had to work with back when I was just a lass.”

The door opened and a photographer came in. He was young and geeky and dressed all in black, with a silver ring in his nose. He was carrying a huge, expensive camera, which he aimed at Baby Bear. “The conference director wants some shots of you and your class. Stand next to your student there and act like you’re teaching her or something.”

Baby Bear came and stood awkwardly beside Goldilocks. Even though she was sitting down, he was still shorter than her.

“Cheese,” said Goldilocks.

“Porridge,” said Baby Bear.

The photographer took several shots in quick succession. Then he circled around the two of them, taking pictures from all possible angles.

After he left, Baby Bear scratched his head. “Where were we? Ah, yes. You have some research to do on the layout of villagers’ homes in 1944 France.”

“But … why?” Goldilocks said. “I can just make things up, can’t I? It’s fiction.”

“Don’t forget the jet car in the garage,” said Robin.

Goldilocks glared at him. “What kind of idiot would put a jet car in a garage? Nobody has jet cars! They aren’t invented yet.”

“Exactly,” said Mrs. Hubbard.

Baby Bear stepped in. “You’re quite right, Robin and Mrs. Hubbard. Houses were very different in 1944, and Goldilocks can’t just make things up. She needs to do some research. This is important, because there’ll be a lot of action in Elise’s house, and the layout of the building will determine what kind of action is possible.”

Goldilocks was beginning to see it. “Oh, because if I have a fight scene in the kitchen and there’s no island in the center, then I can’t have them bashing each other against it or dodging around it.”

“Exactly.”

“Oh, my! This is a lot of work!” said Goldilocks.

“We’ve hardly begun,” said Baby Bear. “But perhaps we should ask the Big Bad Wolf to come up and help us brainstorm about your …”

Baby Bear stopped. He was scanning all around the room with a strange expression on his face.

Goldilocks stood up and looked to the far back corner where she had seen the Big Bad Wolf sleeping earlier.

The Big Bad Wolf was gone.

The room was silent for a long moment.

From far away, a shrill note began rising and falling, rising and falling, louder and louder.

Goldilocks’s heart began slamming against her chest.

The sound was the distant wail of an ambulance.
