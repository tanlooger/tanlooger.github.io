title: Chapter 8 Your People's Secret Stories
---

DURING THE MIDMORNING break, Goldilocks realized that the other students were all acting strangely. As if she were somebody special. Like she knew what she was doing.

She didn’t understand why they thought that. If they found out she was a fraud, they would all hate her. She was very lucky that Baby Bear was giving her so much extra help. But she also felt a bit queasy about the Big Bad Wolf’s sudden interest in her. What if it wasn’t her writing that he liked? What if it was … something else? Goldilocks shivered. Surely, Baby Bear wouldn’t have invited him to this conference if he were a wicked person?

When the students returned to the room, Goldilocks saw that Little Pig had a very satisfied expression on his face.

The Big Bad Wolf was nowhere in sight.

Baby Bear glared at Little Pig. “The Big Bad Wolf has paid his debt to society. There was no reason for you to tell the conference director about his … past.”

Little Pig snorted. “If it were a couple of bears he had brutally murdered, you wouldn’t feel safe with him walking around. You heard him boasting about eating pigs. What were you thinking, to invite him to this conference when you knew I’d be here?”

Goldilocks felt cold all over. The Big Bad Wolf? A murderer?

Baby Bear folded his paws across his chest. “I’m quite convinced that he’s reformed his ways. He’s a well-respected literary agent now, and he is no danger at all to anybody at this conference.”

Little Pig smirked. “We’ll just see if the conference director agrees.”

“If she does, then I’ll give her a piece of my mind.” Baby Bear savagely flung open his laptop. “Now we’ve wasted enough time on this foolishness. On to the next step in the Snowflake.”

A low murmur ran around the room.

Goldilocks wondered if she should ditch her lunch appointment with the Big Bad Wolf.

“You’ve all written the first two paragraphs in your one-page synopsis, and it was easy, wasn’t it?” Baby Bear said. “Not as boring as you might have thought—because you’re focusing on the disasters. Your homework tonight will be to finish your synopsis. But in the meantime, we’re going to work on your characters next.”

Mrs. Hubbard said, “I thought we already did that yesterday?”

“In the Snowflake Method, we alternate. We work on your plot, then your characters, then your plot, then your characters, each time going deeper. Yesterday, when we did the third step of the Snowflake, it was fairly superficial character work. Names, Goals, Ambitions, Values—that sort of thing. Today, we’re going to get inside the skin of your characters.”

Baby Bear paused to take a drink of water from a bottle of Evian on his table.

Goldilocks opened her laptop to take notes. She could hardly wait for this next step. She loved character-oriented fiction. Her favorite authors dove deep inside the psyches of their characters. Baby Bear probably had very little to teach her on this subject, but she might pick up a tidbit or two. And she might surprise him with her stunning knowledge of the subject.

“Who wants to be on the hot seat?” Baby Bear asked.

Goldilocks didn’t say anything. She would love to get more help on her characters, but she didn’t want to hog attention.

Little Pig raised his right front hoof. “I don’t need any help on my characters, because they’re based on real-life people—including a very high-ranking executive pig. But I’d like to hire somebody to help me with my manuscript, and I’m paying top dollar.” He shot a look at Goldilocks.

Baby Bear’s face went very tight. “If … anybody is interested in working with Little Pig, please meet him after class. Right now, I’d like to focus on developing fictional characters. Who wants to volunteer?”

Mrs. Hubbard said, “I’m dying to hear more about that story Goldilocks is writing. It sounds wonderful.”

A rustle of yeses ran around the room.

“Goldilocks, it sounds like you’re elected. Come on up to the hot seat,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks felt a little faint, but she went forward and sat down. She wondered if her hair looked all right.

“Tell me about this hero in your story, Dirk Steele,” said Baby Bear. “He’s doing a very brave thing, parachuting into Nazi territory to blow up a place that is sure to be heavily guarded. Why is he doing that?”

“I …” Goldilocks didn’t want to say she didn’t know. She hadn’t really worried much about Dirk’s motivation. “Well, he hates the Nazis.”

“In 1944, all Americans hated the Nazis,” Baby Bear said. “But Dirk is the only one I see parachuting into a French village in the dark of night with a duffel bag filled with explosives. He’ll probably be killed on this mission. Why did he volunteer for such a dangerous assignment?”

Goldilocks just started talking without even thinking. She spent ten minutes explaining how Dirk grew up in a very rough neighborhood in the Bronx. He was small when he was younger, and the bigger boys often bullied him. He learned to be tough and fight back. Now that he was a grown man, big and strong, he wasn’t afraid of anybody.

Dirk’s best friend was a Jewish boy named Benny. Benny’s uncle lived in Berlin, and his shop had been destroyed by the Nazis on Kristallnacht. Benny didn’t know if his uncle was alive or dead. Dirk had volunteered for this mission because he knew there were millions of people like Benny’s uncle in Europe. And he wanted to do his part to beat the Nazi bullies. Dirk wasn’t afraid of anybody.

Baby Bear asked about Dirk’s family.

Goldilocks explained that he had several brothers, but he wasn’t married.

“What about a girlfriend?” Baby Bear said. “A big, handsome boy like Dirk should have a girlfriend, right?”

Goldilocks hadn’t thought about that, so she made up something. “Well … he did, but they broke up a month before the mission because Dirk, um, got in a bar fight with some sailors, and one of them was the brother of his girlfriend.”

Baby Bear shook his head. “Dirk’s training for an important mission, and he gets in a bar fight a month before? He’s not too bright, is he?”

“He’s very loyal!” Goldilocks said. “The sailors were picking on his friend Benny, and so Dirk put them all in the hospital.”

Baby Bear said, “Dirk seems to have a protector mentality.”

“Yes, he’s very protective.”

“But he’s going to break his ankle when he lands. Then a woman will be taking care of him, protecting him. How does he feel about that?”

Goldilocks spent a few seconds thinking and then made up something about Dirk’s mental conflicts, and how he would start chafing after a few days of being cooped up in the root cellar. “And … that’s why he’s up in the sitting room when Henri comes to court Elise!”

“Ah, very good!” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks sat back in her chair, thinking she had handled that extremely well. This Snowflake Method was forcing her to think about things she hadn’t really worked out yet, but she could see that it was filling in the gaps in her story nicely. Every time Baby Bear asked a question, she could easily make up something on the spot to answer it. She felt very pleased that she was such a talented writer.

“So tell me about Henri,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks shrugged. “There’s not much to say. He’s the villain. He’s courting Elise, and he’s been threatening to tell the Nazis about her daughter if she doesn’t, um, … you know.” She wasn’t sure if Baby Bear was old enough to know about men and women sleeping together. He was obviously a very naive young bear.

“Henri sounds like a bad man,” said Baby Bear.

“Can we talk about Elise and Monique?” Goldilocks said. “I think we’ve done enough on Henri. I told you, he’s not important.”

“But he’s the villain of the story, at least early on,” said Baby Bear.

Goldilocks shook her head. “Villains aren’t important. I don’t like Henri, and I think it’s a waste of time to talk about him. And anyway, he’s going to be killed at the end of the first act.”

“Villains are very important,” Baby Bear said. “My dad published a famous story years ago, and he focused heavily on the villain. It’s based on a true incident. Back when I was a cub, a human child broke into our house. She stole some of our porridge, broke our furniture, and was actually sleeping in my bed when we got home. Then she resisted arrest and escaped. Obviously an awful, wicked human, but it was a powerful story because of that.”

Goldilocks felt so hot she began fanning her cheeks. “That … sounds terrible. But perhaps if you knew the girl’s background, you might understand her better. Perhaps she had a horrible childhood. Perhaps she was lost. Or hungry. Or frightened of bears. There could be … all sorts of reasons she did what she did.”

Baby Bear scowled. “Hmmph! She should have gone to jail.”

Goldilocks was blushing fiercely, and she desperately wanted to run away, but that would look very guilty. She couldn’t bear for the other students to guess what sort of person she really was. “I don’t think Papa Bear’s book did a very good job with his villain. Papa Bear ought to have thought more about the girl’s motivations, don’t you think?”

“Yes, well … I’m sure he could have,” Baby Bear said curtly. “But at least Papa Bear didn’t kill off his villain right at the beginning of the story. If you’re going to go easy on a real-life villain, then shouldn’t you be willing to put more work into your own fictional villain?”

“Yes, of course, that’s just what I was thinking, that’s exactly what I was about to say.” Goldilocks realized she was gabbling.

“Very well, then, I want you to treat your villain with the same respect you treat your hero,” Baby Bear said. “Let’s firm up your story. Right now, your story is weak.”

“Weak?” Goldilocks felt her heart stutter. That wasn’t true, was it? Everyone had been telling her she had an excellent story. “Whatever do you mean?”

“The strength of your story is set by the strength of your villain,” Baby Bear said. “Strong villain, strong story. Weak villain, weak story. And you have a very weak villain.”

“The Nazis are my villain,” Goldilocks said.

“Nonsense. The Nazis are abstract. I can’t visualize a million Nazis. I can visualize one bald, fat French collaborator who wants to get your heroine in bed. But right now, he’s weak and boring. You’ve made him unattractive, and he’s so stupid that he gets himself killed in the first act.”

Goldilocks didn’t know what to think. “You said that was good.”

“It was good for your heroine. It forced her to commit to the story. But it was bad for your story tension, because it got rid of your villain.”

“Why didn’t you say something if it was so awful?”

Baby Bear smiled. “Because it isn’t awful. There are things to like in your story. But you have a weak villain. And now it’s time to make him stronger.”

“But … how? What do I have to do?”

“I want you to put yourself inside the skin of Henri,” Baby Bear said. “Figure out what makes him tick. Everybody has a secret story that nobody else knows. I want to know Henri’s secret story. I want to understand why he does what he does. So tell us Henri’s secret story—the story in which he’s the hero. And when you’ve done that, we can go back and rework your earlier steps.”

“But we’ve put so much work into my story!” Goldilocks said.

Baby Bear looked exasperated. “Close your eyes and imagine that you’re Henri. In 1944, you are middle-aged. Therefore, you were born around 1900 in a small village in France. Tell me your secret story.”

“Well …” Goldilocks felt her mind racing. “I was short and chubby as a child, and the other children picked on me. As I got older, I never got big and strong like Dirk, so I had to use my brains. I learned to pit my enemies against each other.”

“Give me an example of how you did that,” said Baby Bear.

“In high school, there were two handsome and popular boys who often picked on me,” Goldilocks said. “Charles and Michel. So I sent Charles a love letter that was purportedly from Michel’s girlfriend. Charles thought it was real and tried to seduce the girl. Michel found out and they had a huge fight. Michel lost an eye, and Charles was forced to leave town and join the army.”

“Did you fight in World War I?” Baby Bear asked.

“I enlisted as soon as I was old enough, but I had poor eyesight and couldn’t shoot, so I worked as a cook. I always felt ashamed that I couldn’t fight for my country.”

“What happened after the war?” asked Baby Bear. “Things were very bad, weren’t they?”

Goldilocks nodded. “Yes, there was the Spanish flu. Then terrible economic times. I found work keeping the books for a criminal organization.”

Goldilocks spun out a long story about Henri scratching out a living in postwar France, marrying a homely woman because he had got her pregnant, then living through the Great Depression and losing both his child and wife in an auto accident. And making many enemies of the honest people in the town, who hated the gangster that Henri worked for.

“Then the Nazis came, and I saw that there was no way to fight them. The Resistance was disorganized and foolhardy. I had to do what the Nazis said, or they would kill me. Everybody in town hated me, but there was one person who never treated me with contempt.”

“Who was that?” Baby Bear asked.

“The little girl, Monique. Elise’s child.”

“What did Monique do that made you feel special?” Baby Bear asked.

“She brought me flowers every morning and left them on my doorstep.” Goldilocks still had her eyes closed, and she could picture little Monique creeping to Henri’s door every morning very early and leaving an armful of roses. “And she smiled at me. Nobody else smiled at me. I thought that her mother, Elise, must be a very kind woman, to have such a daughter.”

“Would you ever hurt little Monique?” Baby Bear asked. “Would you ever turn her in to the Nazis?”

“I’d … rather die first.” Goldilocks shuddered and opened her eyes. She found that she was crying. For a few moments, she had felt like she really was Henri. It was a very disconcerting feeling, because Henri was the villain. She had thought she hated him. But now she also felt a little love in her heart for him. She loved him and hated him, both at the same time. She knew that didn’t make sense, but it was just how she felt.

Baby Bear was looking at his watch. “It’s almost noon. Are there any final comments before we break for lunch?”

Little Pig snorted loudly. “I think you’ve ruined your villain, Goldilocks. Now he’s a sappy, stupid, sentimental person. But don’t take my word for it. You’re having lunch with the Big Bad Wolf, and he’s going to laugh in your face and tell you that Henri is the worst villain in the history of fiction.”

The lunch bell rang.

All the students stood up and hurried out.

Goldilocks sat on the chair with her eyes closed, hoping to ask Baby Bear’s opinion when everybody was gone.

But when the hubbub died down and she opened her eyes, the room was empty.

And now she had to face the Big Bad Wolf and tell him about her sappy, stupid, sentimental villain. This was going to be the worst day of her life.
