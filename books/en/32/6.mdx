title: Chapter 6 Nothing Is More Important Than Characters
---

“YOU DON’T LOOK happy, Goldilocks,” said Baby Bear. “Whatever is the matter? You’ve got a well-structured story with three acts. You have three disasters that escalate to a strong conclusion. What more could you want?”

Goldilocks sat on the floor and put her face in her hands and shook her head. “These people … they feel so flat!” She felt horrible for sounding ungrateful, but she couldn’t help herself. Baby Bear was ruining her story.

“Explain what you mean by flat,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks tried desperately to find the right words. “I … wanted a handsome man who’s big and strong and kind. I wanted a beautiful heroine who’s brave and fierce and passionate. And I don’t see any of that here. This is going to be one of those awful, shoot-em-up stories where I don’t care about the characters.”

The Big Bad Wolf came over and patted her clumsily on the shoulder. “You want to tell her, Baby Bear, or shall I?” His voice sounded very kind.

Baby Bear sat down next to her on the floor. “The Snowflake Method has ten steps, and we’ve only looked at two. The third step is all about your characters.”

A surge of hope rose in Goldilocks’s heart. “R-really? We’re going to work on my characters?”

“You’re going to work on your characters,” Baby Bear said. “I’ll just make some suggestions on what to work on next.”

“Good, because I don’t want you writing my story for me. I’m the author, not you.”

Baby Bear nodded. “Of course. You’re the writer. You bring the creativity. The Snowflake Method just tells you what to be creative on next. And right now, it’s time to get creative on your characters.”

Baby Bear stood up and took Goldilocks’s hand to pull her to her feet. “The first thing we need to do is make a list of your characters and give them roles and names.” He went to the whiteboard and erased everything on it with the back of his furry paw. “Who is your lead character?”

Goldilocks sat on the edge of the table with her back to the other students. “My heroine. And her name is Elise. I like that name. I think it’s pretty.”

Baby Bear wrote down on the whiteboard, HEROINE: ELISE. “Very good. And you have a handsome hero, right?”

“Yes. He’s from America, and his name is …” Goldilocks thought for a moment. “Dirk. That sounds strong and mysterious and a little dangerous. He’s a brave soldier and he had a hard life growing up, so people think he’s rough and a little cruel, but inside, he’s kind and gentle.”

Baby Bear wrote down, HERO: DIRK. “And Elise has a little daughter?”

“Yes, she’s eight years old and her name is Monique.”

Baby Bear wrote down, DAUGHTER: MONIQUE. “Now, there was this wretched French collaborator.”

Goldilocks shrugged. “He’s the villain, so I haven’t thought much about him. He’s just this wicked, evil man who wants to get Elise into bed, and he’s collaborating with the Nazis because he’s a coward. I hate him.”

Baby Bear’s small, furry mouth pursed into a thin, straight line. “Does this man have a name?”

Goldilocks shrugged. “It doesn’t matter. Call him anything. He’s awful.”

Baby Bear just looked at her.

“Okay, call him Henri.” Goldilocks wondered what had got into Baby Bear. He looked very worried about something.

Baby Bear wrote, VILLAIN: HENRI. “Are there any more main characters?”

Goldilocks couldn’t think of any more. “There will be some minor characters. There’s the village postmistress and the mayor and the Nazi soldiers. But they don’t have big roles.”

“Very well, then,” Baby Bear said, still not smiling. “Now I need to know a bit more about these characters.”

“Well, Elise is petite and pretty. And she has long, raven-black hair, beautiful and straight.” Goldilocks fingered her curly blonde hair. “And green eyes. That’s very important.”

“Green eyes.” Baby Bear sighed deeply. “That’s it?”

“Blue eyes are so overdone.”

“And what does Elise want?” Baby Bear said. “Specifically and concretely, what does she want most when the story begins?”

Goldilocks hadn’t thought about that. “I don’t know. She wants what every beautiful young woman wants, I suppose.”

“And what is that?”

Goldilocks suddenly wondered why the room was so hot. She tried to think, but her head felt like it was packed with helium. Then she remembered the last Miss America contest. She’d felt so jealous of all those poised, beautiful, talented, intelligent young women. And every one of them wanted the exact same thing.

“World peace!” Goldilocks shouted. “Elise wants world peace!”

Baby Bear rolled his eyes.

The Big Bad Wolf fell to the floor, holding his stomach and laughing hysterically.

The whole class began giggling.

Goldilocks wondered what was so funny. World peace was important, wasn’t it? Everybody knew that. Why wouldn’t a young French woman, caught in World War II, want world peace?

Baby Bear sighed and pulled out his phone and a hundred-dollar bill. “Goldilocks, how long can you hold your breath?”

“I don’t know. Maybe thirty seconds. It’s been a long time since I tried.”

“I’ll give you this hundred-dollar bill if you can hold your breath for two minutes.”

Goldilocks didn’t know if she could do that, but it couldn’t hurt to try. “Okay.”

Baby Bear set the timer on his phone. “The Big Bad Wolf will squeeze your nose to make sure you don’t cheat. If you open your mouth before the time’s up, you lose.”

Goldilocks nodded.

The Big Bad Wolf came over and gripped her nostrils tightly. “Is that comfortable, my dear?”

“It’s fine.”

“Take a deep breath and hold it,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks filled her lungs and clamped her mouth shut.

Baby Bear started the timer.

The first fifteen seconds went comfortably, and Goldilocks thought this wasn’t so hard. By thirty seconds, her lungs were starting to feel a little tight. At forty-five seconds, her head began feeling funny. As the timer passed one minute, she started feeling desperate.

Seconds ticked by, each more horrible than the last.

A minute and five seconds.

A minute six.

Seven.

Goldilocks saw that she wasn’t going to make it.

Eight.

Her lungs were screaming for air.

Nine.

She couldn’t stand it any longer.

Ten.

She opened her mouth and sucked in air.

The Big Bad Wolf released her nose and shook his head sadly. “Nice try, but no Benjamin.”

Baby Bear put the hundred back in the little wallet clipped to his belt. “Why did you open your mouth?”

“Because I wanted air.”

“Not world peace?”

Goldilocks giggled. “Not right then. I wanted air more than anything in the world.”

“So why were you holding your breath?”

“Well … I also wanted that hundred-dollar bill.”

Baby Bear burst into a smile. “That’s what I call a Goal—when you want something specific and concrete. Like holding your breath for two minutes to earn a hundred dollars. You wanted that a lot, didn’t you?”

Goldilocks nodded. “Well, of course. Very much.”

“But you gave up.”

“I suppose I just didn’t want it enough.”

“If it was a million dollars, do you think you could have lasted two minutes?”

“Maybe. I’d try a lot harder for a million dollars.”

Baby Bear went to the whiteboard and wrote down:





PROPERTIES OF GOALS:

Simple

Concrete

Important

Achievable

Difficult





The Big Bad Wolf was studying Goldilocks. “Would you really hold your breath for two minutes for a million dollars?”

Goldilocks thought about that. “It might take some training, but yes, I would.”

“You’d like to be rich someday, wouldn’t you?”

“Well … of course. Wouldn’t everybody?”

The Big Bad Wolf shook his head. “No, of course not! What would a wolf do with money? Now if you offered me my own herd of little pigs—”

“Oh!” Goldilocks said. “That’s horrible!”

“Objection!” squeaked Little Pig.

Baby Bear cleared his throat sharply. “Enough joking about pigs, Big Bad Wolf. That’s not funny.”

“Sorry.” The Big Bad Wolf didn’t sound very sorry.

“So you want to be rich, Goldilocks?” Baby Bear said.

She nodded.

“That’s a bit abstract, isn’t it? How would you know when you’re rich?”

“Well … I don’t know. But if I had a million dollars, I’d for sure be rich.”

Baby Bear grinned. “Being rich is abstract. For one person, being rich means having a million dollars. For another, it means having a herd of little, um, cows. For a very poor person in a third-world country, it might mean owning a phone.”

Goldilocks hadn’t thought about any of that. “It’s kind of like world peace, isn’t it? That’s vague and undefined too.”

“Yes, world peace is an abstract idea,” Baby Bear said. “That doesn’t mean it’s wrong to want world peace. But it does mean that you have to define what it means to you. You can’t have a story about somebody who is trying to achieve world peace. You can have a story about somebody who’s trying to eliminate all nuclear weapons from the planet. That’s a Goal—it’s simple, concrete, important, difficult, and just possibly achievable.”

The Big Bad Wolf licked his lips. “A herd of little pigs is achievable.”

“I’m going to speak to the conference director about this … criminal!” Little Pig stomped out of the room.

Baby Bear smacked the Big Bad Wolf’s paws. “That was very rude. After this workshop, you are going to go apologize to Little Pig. Is that clear?”

The Big Bad Wolf shot a venomous look at the door. “I suppose.”

Goldilocks wondered what this was all about. She thought that this couldn’t be the first time the Big Bad Wolf had met Little Pig. There was obviously some bad blood between them, but she couldn’t think what it might be about. The Big Bad Wolf didn’t really want to eat Little Pig, did he? She shuddered.

Baby Bear was looking very angry. Finally, he turned back to Goldilocks. “I’m sorry, Goldilocks. Let’s get back to your story. Something abstract like world peace is what I call an Ambition. It drives your Goal.”

“I don’t understand,” Goldilocks said.

“You have an Ambition to be rich,” Baby Bear said. “Therefore, if you had a chance to earn a million dollars by holding your breath for two minutes, you would make it your Goal to earn that million dollars. Because your Ambition is to be rich.”

The Big Bad Wolf sneered. “I don’t understand humans and their obsession with money, when what really matters is … um, food.”

Goldilocks grabbed his shoulders and shook him hard. “How could you be so cruel to those poor pigs?”

“Because I like not being hungry,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “How could you be so foolish as to want a big stack of green pieces of paper? What good is paper?”

“Because I can use money to buy anything I like. Such as clothes.”

“Don’t need those,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

“Makeup.”

“Don’t need that either.”

“A nice house.”

“Not as good as a warm, dry cave.”

“Food.”

“That’s what I said, but then you got all hoity-toity.” The Big Bad Wolf scowled at her. “Don’t you like bacon for breakfast?”

“That’s different,” said Goldilocks.

“How is that different?”

Baby Bear was jumping up and down with excitement. “Do you two see what you’re arguing about?”

Goldilocks shook her head.

The Big Bad Wolf grinned and nodded.

“Values!” said Baby Bear. “Each of you values different things. Goldilocks values clothes and makeup and a nice house and food. That’s what drives her Ambition to be rich someday—because then she’ll have the things she values.”

“Hmmph!” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Human Values make no sense at all. I’m happy with food.”

“And a warm, dry cave,” said Baby Bear.

“Well … of course.”

Goldilocks shuddered. “Yuck, that would be horrible! How could you value a cave?”

The Big Bad Wolf shuddered back. “How could you value a huge, ugly, artificial house made of wood and plaster and stucco, reeking of unnatural things like paint and carpet and curtains? And keeping out the clean, fresh air and the moonlight? How would you even howl at night? That would be a horrible life.”

“That will be enough arguing,” said Baby Bear. “You two will be going round and round all day because each of you believes that your Values are ‘obvious.’ But they’re only obvious to you. They’re not obvious to everyone.”

Goldilocks folded her arms across her chest. “My Values are obvious to anyone with a lick of sense.”

The Big Bad Wolf scowled at her. “Your Values don’t make any sense at all to animals. And there are more of us than there are of you.”

“Time out!” Baby Bear shouted. “You’ll never get anywhere by arguing about your Values. By definition, Values are so obvious that they can’t be proved. Let’s look at how this works.” He went to the whiteboard and wrote down:





VALUES => AMBITION => GOAL





“Each one of us has Values that we think are obvious. Goldilocks believes that nothing is more important than money. The Big Bad Wolf thinks that nothing is more important than a herd of … food. Neither of them can give a reason for their Values, because it seems to them that no reason is necessary. Their Values are Values because they just are.”

“Obviously,” Goldilocks said.

“Axiomatically,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

Baby Bear grinned. “At least you two agree on something. And from your Values spring Ambitions. Because Goldilocks has a Value that nothing is more important than money, she has an Ambition to be rich someday. Her Value drives her Ambition. But that Ambition is abstract. We don’t know what it looks like. Now if she has an opportunity to win a million dollars by holding her breath for two minutes, that creates a Goal for her—to win the money. That Goal would fulfill her Ambition to be rich.”

The Big Bad Wolf gave a curt nod. “You could write a story about that—a greedy, blonde, airheaded girl who was willing to endanger her life to accumulate a large number of pieces of useless green paper.”

Goldilocks scowled at him. “And the villain would be a large, smelly, pig-eating canine who tried to discourage the heroine from achieving her life’s Ambition.”

Baby Bear put his paws on his round, furry hips. “You two need to stop squabbling. Goldilocks, I’m going to give you homework. Are you ready to work on your characters and make them into real, human, three-dimensional people?”

She nodded and shot a sidelong glance at the Big Bad Wolf. “As long as they’re human.”

“A fate worse than death,” muttered the Big Bad Wolf.

Baby Bear went to the whiteboard. “For each of your four main characters, I want you to write down the following information.” He wrote on the board:





YOUR CHARACTER SUMMARY SHEETS





Name:

Role:

Goal:

Ambition:

Values (two or more):

One-sentence summary:

One-paragraph summary:





Goldilocks took a picture of the board with her phone. “Why do you want more than one Value?”

“Because most people have several things they value. And those can be in conflict. And when a person has conflicting Values, that leads to internal conflict, and the person becomes unpredictable.”

The Big Bad Wolf had a huge, sloppy grin on his face. “I don’t mean to be nosy, but isn’t that a mistake there at the bottom? You’re asking for a one-sentence summary and a one-paragraph summary. She already did those.”

Baby Bear shook his head. “She already wrote a one-sentence summary and a one-paragraph summary for the lead character. But the other characters all have their own personal stories. Each one of them thinks they’re the hero of their personal story. That personal story isn’t the same as the personal story for the hero of your novel. You must understand the personal story of each character in your novel. You need to know what drives them, what they want in life, and how they plan to get it.”

“It seems like a lot of work,” said Goldilocks.

“You could just go type your novel without doing any of this,” said Baby Bear.

“No, I can’t! I told you, I don’t know where to start.”

Baby Bear pointed at the whiteboard. “Now you know where to start. Today’s class is over. If you give yourself one hour per character, you could have this all done in four hours and show me what you’ve got tomorrow.”

Goldilocks sighed. It looked like she was in for a late night.



* * *



That evening after Goldilocks put the children to bed, she sat down at her computer and began typing. And the ideas started to come. She already knew Elise’s story, so that was easy. And she also partly knew Dirk’s story. As she typed, things seemed to magically fall into place. Monique was a little harder, but with some effort, Goldilocks came up with some reasonable ideas for her.

But Henri.

Goldilocks really didn’t like him. He was a slimy, middle-aged man, and all he cared about was getting Elise into bed. What a horrible person! She couldn’t think of much to write about him, but it didn’t matter. He was the villain, and he was going to be killed anyway, so she didn’t have to work hard on him.

By midnight, Goldilocks was finished. She crawled into bed feeling like a real novelist at last. Tomorrow, she’d show her work to Baby Bear, and he’d tell her she was a brilliant storyteller, and then he’d help her on the next step.

She couldn’t wait.
