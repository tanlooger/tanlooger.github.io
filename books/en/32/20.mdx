title: Chapter 20 The Snowflake for This Book
---

I DESIGNED THE story for this book using the Snowflake Method. In this chapter, I’ll show you my design. You’ll note that the Snowflake here is not quite in sync with the final story. That’s fine. The point of the Snowflake Method is to get the book written. Your story will evolve as you write it. Don’t feel bound to your design.

I created this chapter using my software Snowflake Pro and then exported it as a Word document. I tweaked the format to be suitable for a book and made a few changes in final editing. Because the story is so short, I skipped the long synopsis step, since that seemed to be overkill. It’s important to adapt the Snowflake Method to the needs of your book.

Step 4: Short Synopsis

Goldilocks has always wanted to write a novel, but everyone in her family told her it was “impractical,” so she put off her dream until her children started school. When she decides to take classes at a writing conference, she first tries Papa Bear’s outlining approach, but she finds it too hard for her. Then she tries Mama Bear’s “organic” method, but she finds it too soft and squishy. Finally, she goes to Baby Bear’s course on the Snowflake Method. It sounds good, but then Little Pig calculates that it will take forever to write her novel at the rate she’s going. Goldilocks doesn’t know what to think. She’s wavering, and then the Big Bad Wolf walks into the classroom and guns down Baby Bear in cold blood.

Goldilocks is furious and attacks the Big Bad Wolf. Baby Bear jumps up and explains that he isn’t dead, that it was just a stunt to show the importance of using disasters at the breakpoints between acts. Goldilocks sees how valuable the Three-Disaster Structure can be, and she whips out a one-paragraph summary that has the class breathless. However, when she begins doing her character sheets, she focuses on her hero and heroine and gives the villain short shrift. Little Pig wants to write an autobiographical novel and came to the conference to team up with an author who will do the hard work. Goldilocks produces an excellent one-page synopsis, and the Big Bad Wolf tells her she’s showing some talent and invites her to lunch. In the next session, the wolf has disappeared, and Baby Bear asks to see Goldilocks’s character synopses and tells her that her villain is two-dimensional. Goldilocks makes another try, and this time her villain is more believable, but Little Pig sneers that she’s not going to impress the Big Bad Wolf with a villain like that.

Goldilocks goes to lunch, terrified of what the Big Bad Wolf will say. Will he sneer at her like Little Pig did? Will she lose her chance with the big-shot literary agent? But she decides that she must stop worrying what other people think. She talks to the Big Bad Wolf about her novel and then shows him her character synopses, and he starts crying. He tells her that it’s hard to be the villain. People don’t understand you and they think you’re evil. He tells his story about how, as a young wolf, he was framed for the murder of two pigs. He served time in prison, and nobody ever believed he was innocent. Goldilocks sees that he has a soft and kind heart, and she desperately wants him to be her agent. After lunch, Goldilocks complains to Baby Bear that she now has to backtrack. He explains why that’s normal and how the Snowflake Method encourages you to backtrack early, before you have a lot written. The next morning, Baby Bear teaches how to write a long synopsis. Little Pig pressures Goldilocks to help him with his story, and the Big Bad Wolf tells him off. Little Pig stalks out in a rage. Next, Baby Bear puts Goldilocks on the hot seat to help her develop her character bibles. The Big Bad Wolf has curled up in a back corner and gone to sleep. Baby Bear grills Goldilocks for quite a while, and a photographer comes in to take pictures. Nobody notices when the Big Bad Wolf leaves. But they all notice the wail of sirens in the background. Baby Bear goes to investigate and learns that Little Pig has been murdered. Only then does everyone see that the Big Bad Wolf is gone.

They all go out to see what’s happened. The police have arrested the Big Bad Wolf, and Papa Bear is explaining how he discovered the body of Little Pig and then caught the Big Bad Wolf washing his hands in the men’s room and arrested him and called the police. It’s clear to everybody that the Big Bad Wolf is the murderer. Goldilocks visits him in jail, and he insists he’s innocent—that he’s been framed again. She believes him and spends the evening trying to figure out how to clear his name, but gets nowhere. She finally does her homework very late that night and staggers into class the next morning. Baby Bear teaches on the subject of scene lists, and he explains how to do one. When he mentions time stamps, Goldilocks gets very excited and goes rushing out. She finds Papa Bear and gets the receipt for his coffee. She finds the photographer’s camera and steals it. She goes to a quiet spot in the coffee shop patio and looks at the pictures. Tiny Pig, the nephew of the murdered Little Pig, shows up and joins her. They find a photo of the Big Bad Wolf in class sleeping and the time stamp proves he is innocent. Tiny Pig pulls out a syringe and tries to inject Goldilocks. She sprays him with pepper, and Robin Hood arrives to help. Tiny Pig is arrested, Goldilocks is a hero, and the Big Bad Wolf is set free. That afternoon, Baby Bear gets Goldilocks to describe what happened. She tells about her Goal-Conflict-Setback and her Reaction-Dilemma-Decision. Baby Bear explains how those work and tells her she needs to sketch out her scenes in advance using those patterns. Once she’s done that, she can start writing her novel. Goldilocks goes home and maps out scene 1 of her novel. Then she starts writing, and the words come very smoothly and easily. Goldilocks is very happy.





Step 5: Character Synopses





Goldilocks:

Goldilocks was a smart kid. She learned to read before she went to kindergarten, and she always had her nose in a book. When she was eight years old, she had a traumatic experience when she got lost on a walk in the woods. She came to the house of three bears and tasted their porridge, sat in their chairs, and slept in their beds. She escaped when the bears came home. Goldilocks put it all behind her, but the incident was traumatic enough that she developed an unhealthy fear of what other people think of her. So she has spent her life trying to make other people happy.

When Goldilocks started school, she loved writing stories. She won a writing contest in grade school and thought she might like to be an author someday. But when she started high school, her parents made it clear that they wanted her to do something serious when she grew up. They considered writing fiction a silly and childish pursuit, and told her that she needed to study something “practical” that would help her earn a living.

So Goldilocks studied marketing in college, and graduated with a degree that her parents thought was practical. She got a job and then soon got married. A year after getting married, she got pregnant with the first of two children, and she quit her job to focus on them. She had a daughter and son and spent several happy years with them. When the youngest started kindergarten, Goldilocks realized that she had now been out of the job force for nearly eight years and her skills were rusty. She could get an entry-level job at just above minimum wage. But the thought of doing more marketing for a company she didn’t care about made her break out in hives. Her husband was earning a good income, and they didn’t need the money. But she desperately wanted to do something useful with her life.

She decided to do something dreadfully impractical—she was going to write a novel like the ones she often read. But she quickly found that she had no idea how to get started. When she opened her word processor, the empty page stared at her and she had a terrible fear of getting started on the wrong track. She already felt like she was far behind, and she couldn’t bear the thought of spending years of her life working on a manuscript that was unsaleable.

So she decided to go to a writing conference and see if she could quickly get up to speed on the task of writing a novel.





Baby Bear:

Baby Bear is a young bear in his twenties who grew up in a home of writers. Both parents, Papa Bear and Mama Bear, are writers and teachers on the craft of fiction writing. Writing is in Baby Bear’s blood.

Papa Bear is an outliner and Mama Bear is a seat-of-the-pantser. Neither of those approaches works for Baby Bear. He loves the Snowflake Method because it works for him.

He’s now been teaching for a few years and is starting to get good as a teacher. At this conference, he wants to make a bit of a splash, but his first session isn’t scheduled until late on the first day of the conference. He knows that people will go to hear Papa Bear and Mama Bear teach their methods first. He hopes that writers who find that these methods don’t work for them may find the Snowflake Method better.

Baby Bear convinces a well-known literary agent, the Big Bad Wolf, to barge in on his class and fire a gun loaded with blanks at him. The purpose is to show his students what a disaster looks like. The stunt works better than he had expected, because it causes Goldilocks to get into a fight with the Big Bad Wolf.

Baby Bear sees a lot of potential in Goldilocks. On the surface, she looks like an airhead, but when he pushes her, she does the hard work of improving her one-sentence summary and her one-paragraph summary. When she begins work on her characters, it’s clear that her hero and heroine are going to be fairly good, but her villain is a horrible two-dimensional caricature. Baby Bear wrestles with how to get her to do better, but no solution comes to mind.

When Goldilocks expands out her one-paragraph summary to a full page, it reads pretty well. Goldilocks doesn’t like her villain very much, so she is not putting in the effort she needs on him. When she reads her character synopses, it’s clear that the villain needs more work. Goldilocks makes a try at improving her villain, but Little Pig sneers that she’s made him too soft and boring, and he claims that the Big Bad Wolf is going to hate her new villain. Goldilocks is wavering again. Baby Bear wants to tell her that she needs to focus on writing well, not on impressing agents or editors, but he realizes that she has to figure this out for herself.

After her lunch with the Big Bad Wolf, Goldilocks is showing new strength as a writer. She is no longer worried about what anyone thinks about her, and she is making good progress on her one-page synopsis and her character bibles. However, Little Pig is trying to hire a writer to help him, and he keeps bothering Goldilocks. The Big Bad Wolf tells him off, and Little Pig gets angry and stalks out.

Baby Bear puts Goldilocks on the hot seat and doesn’t notice when the Big Bad Wolf leaves. But he does hear the sirens, and when he gets word that Little Pig has been murdered and the Big Bad Wolf has been arrested, he is very upset. He is responsible for the Big Bad Wolf coming to the conference, and now he’s horrified that his kindness has turned into murder.





Big Bad Wolf:

The Big Bad Wolf grew up in a rough neighborhood. As a juvenile, he saw his own uncle killed by a lynch mob who were angry at the murder of Little Red’s grandmother. At the age of nineteen, he was framed for the murder of two pigs. All the Big Bad Wolf remembers is that he slept for a full day, and woke up the next day accused of murder. He had no explanation and no alibi, so he was convicted and served six years in prison.

He spent his time reading in the library and came out of prison determined to make something of himself. He worked in a literary agency for a couple of years and learned the industry and then hung up a shingle on his own and started taking clients. Authors were eager to sign on with him, because they figured he’d be a tough negotiator. And he was, because editors feared him.

The Big Bad Wolf wants to be the most successful agent in the business, and he’s well on his way, but clouds are still hanging over him. There are people who won’t ever forget that he did hard time in prison. For them, he’s a dishonest scoundrel, a liar, a thief, and a murderer. And he can’t see any way to live that down. One of the few people willing to give him a chance is Baby Bear, who likes him for his skill and literary judgment and sees past his rough edges.

When he meets Goldilocks, he’s happy to see what a talented writer she is. She’s got ideas and she’s teachable. The only bad thing at the conference is that Little Pig is there, very full of himself and acting like he can buy his way to a position as a big-shot author, just because he’s a wealthy tycoon. The Big Bad Wolf has words with Little Pig, and even threatens him with becoming lunch. This is stupid, and Big Bad Wolf knows it, but seeing Little Pig reminds him of the years he lost in prison.

The Big Bad Wolf has a nice dinner with Goldilocks and does his best to encourage her. She’s making rapid progress, but he can’t sell her work without a full proposal, which would include a longer synopsis. She’ll also need some sample chapters, and preferably the full manuscript. The next day in class, the Big Bad Wolf takes a nap in the back corner. When he wakes up, Goldilocks is in the hot seat. The Big Bad Wolf tiptoes out to go to the men’s room. While he’s washing his hands, Papa Bear bursts in and accuses him of murdering Little Pig.





Little Pig:

Little Pig is a wealthy business-pig who is ready to retire. He imagines that he could be a famous author, and it just seems reasonable that he ought to be able to buy his way into a book contract.

Little Pig grew up poor, but he started a business with his two brothers when they were young. The business grew and grew, but Little Pig found his brothers annoying. They were lazy and old-fashioned, and they were holding back the company’s growth. Little Pig felt certain that as long as they were in the company, it would never reach its potential. They were, in fact, robbing him of the success that was due him. He made an offer to buy them out, but they both refused.

So Little Pig made a sleeping potion, injected it into the Big Bad Wolf while he slept, murdered his brothers late at night in their houses, and left wolf prints all over. The Big Bad Wolf was arrested, and with no alibi, he was convicted. Now he’s out of prison, but Little Pig knows that the wolf has no suspicions of him, so he’s safe.

Little Pig comes to the conference with his idea for a novel. Papa Bear and Mama Bear are no help, so he goes to Baby Bear’s classes. But Baby Bear keeps droning on about his Snowflake Method, which Little Pig finds very pedestrian. It sounds far too much like work. Why can’t he just be creative and then hire out the details, as he always has in business?

But Baby Bear isn’t having any of that, and the Big Bad Wolf keeps making fun of him. Little Pig gets more and more angry. The establishment is apparently stacked against him, and his money is no good for helping him get published. Finally, in a rage, he stalks out of class and goes to get a latte at the coffee shop. His nephew, Tiny Pig, texts him asking where he is. Tiny Pig was due to fly in tomorrow, but he’s apparently in town already.

Little Pig tells him he’s in the back patio of the coffee shop. Tiny Pig arrives and asks him about the job they had discussed a couple of weeks ago. Little Pig sneers and tells him he’d be better off going back to school and getting a real education instead of chasing sorority girls and getting drunk. Tiny Pig injects him with a paralyzing drug. Little Pig collapses to the ground, frozen. He watches while Tiny Pig makes wolf prints all around him and then slits his throat.

Little Pig’s last thought as consciousness fades is that he’s been hit by a speeding karma.





Tiny Pig:

Tiny Pig is a trust fund brat. His father was murdered by the Big Bad Wolf and his mother is a socialite who has remarried and doesn’t care much about him. Tiny Pig went to college and wasted all his time chasing sorority girls and getting drunk. Once he reached the age of twenty-one, he got full access to his trust fund and blew through the money incredibly fast. Now he’s nearly broke, and thinks that the best thing to do is get a cushy job working for his uncle.

But his uncle, Little Pig, is about to retire. He refuses to help Tiny Pig get a job. Instead, he tells Tiny to go back to college and get a real education and then get an honest job and work his way up. But Little Pig lets slip some information about the death of Tiny’s father. Tiny puts things together and realizes that Little Pig killed his father. He decides to kill his uncle, partly for revenge and partly so he can inherit his wealth.

Tiny gets a potion that paralyzes people and tracks down his uncle at the coffee shop. He injects him with the potion and puts wolf tracks all around him and then kills him.

His plan works. The Big Bad Wolf is arrested for the murder, and Tiny stands to inherit all of his money. But when Goldilocks finds proof that the Big Bad Wolf is innocent, Tiny has to act. He has an extra syringe, which he had made as a backup in case the first wasn’t enough to disable his uncle. He tries to inject Goldilocks with the potion so he can kill her, but she sprays him with pepper. Robin Hood helps subdue him and Goldilocks calls the cops, and Tiny is hauled off to prison, where he soon confesses to his crime.





Mother Hubbard:

Mother Hubbard is a poor widow who wants to get rich by writing a novel. She is fixated on what an interesting life she’s had. But all that has ever happened to her is that she goes to her cupboard every day and it’s bare.

Mother Hubbard is writing a novel about a poor widow exactly like herself. She does not want to write a romance, in which the widow finds a rich husband. She is not interested in writing a thriller or a mystery. She wants a slice-of-life story about herself.

Baby Bear is not much impressed with her story, and Mother Hubbard can’t imagine why. She hates the arrogant and overbearing Little Pig, and she’s intimidated by the Big Bad Wolf. She does like Goldilocks, although the dear girl seems to live in a fantasy world.





Robin Hood:

Robin Hood is a happy young man who lives in Sherwood Forest with his band of merry outlaws, feasting on poached deer and outwitting the Sheriff of Nottingham. He likes nothing more than a party that lasts all weekend, a huge barrel of ale, and swarms of willing wenches.

Robin Hood would like to write a novel, a series of episodes based on his own life. He’s not a very hard worker, and when he goes to the writing conference to learn how it’s done, he realizes that this is beyond his skill.

He can’t help admiring Goldilocks. She’s a hard worker and has a fascinating story. And she’s quite a good-looking wench, although just a bit snooty. Robin Hood does not like Little Pig at all, and he finds the Big Bad Wolf a bit obnoxious.

When Little Pig is killed, Robin Hood isn’t sad. When the Big Bad Wolf is arrested, Robin Hood isn’t surprised. But when Goldilocks develops an unhealthy obsession to clear the Big Bad Wolf, Robin Hood is concerned. Wenches shouldn’t take life so seriously. He tries to talk reason to her, but she gets angry at him and tells him that she doesn’t like to be called a wench. Imagine that! She is one weird wench.

Robin Hood is not the kind of guy to let a wench get away without a pursuit, so he keeps an eye on her. When he sees her going to the coffee shop patio, he hangs out near the conference center, waiting for her to come back so he can talk to her. He sees Tiny Pig go to the back patio, but can’t see or hear what goes on back there. But when he hears Goldilocks screaming for help, he’s there in a flash, with an arrow nocked. He helps arrest Tiny Pig and hopes Goldilocks will thank him in the way any red-blooded guy wants to be thanked by a lovely wench.





Step 6: Long Synopsis

This story was too short to need a long synopsis. The short synopsis was enough to allow me to create the scene list in step 8, so I skipped this step.

Worst childhood memory: He went out for a walk one day as a cub and returned home to find his food eaten, his chair broken, and his bed slept in by a blonde human child who shrieked loudly and ran away. Baby Bear has dreamed for years of finding the girl and bringing her to justice.

Strongest character trait: Much smarter than your average bear.

Weakest character trait: Loyal to a fault. He grew up knowing the Big Bad Wolf and has stood by him, even after he went to prison and was clearly guilty.

Greatest hope: To be a great novelist himself someday, and not just a famous teacher of fiction.

Deepest fear: That none of his students will ever be any good.

How character sees self: A smart bear who knows great fiction and knows how to teach it.

How others see character: A great teacher and mentor.





Big Bad Wolf

Age: 29

Height: 6’0”

Weight: 180 pounds

Ethnic heritage: Wolf

Color of hair: Gray

Color of eyes: Black

Physical description: He is a huge wolf, with intense black eyes that look right through you. He has gray fur and sharp canines and he worked out a lot in prison, so he is incredibly well muscled.

Style of dressing: Wears fur

Sense of humor: He has a sarcastic wit and doesn’t hesitate to puncture an inflated ego. However, he’s quite kind to people who lack self-esteem, and he’d never willingly hurt their feelings, but he does sometimes just because he’s a bit insensitive.

Personality type: Driver expressive

Hobbies: Long-distance running, reading, eating (he especially likes pork ribs).

Favorite music: Punk rock

Favorite books: Thrillers, war novels, especially World War II novels, science fiction

Favorite movies: Die Hard (all four)

Favorite colors: Gray

Description of home: Has a nice, cozy cave.

Educational background: Self-taught while in prison. He read most of the prison library, and especially loves fiction.

Work experience: He was framed for the murder of two pigs at the age of nineteen and sent to prison. He worked in the laundry and was paroled for good behavior. He worked in a literary agency for two years and has recently started his own agency, the Big Bad Wolf Literary Agency.

Family: He comes from a pack of fiercely loyal wolves. However, none of them believe that he didn’t kill the pigs, so he feels a bit uncomfortable with them. They’re a violent bunch, and he’s the quiet and studious one.

Male friends: He grew up with Baby Bear, who maintained friendship with him while in prison. However, Baby Bear has never quite believed that he’s innocent. Baby Bear insists that Big Bad Wolf “had your reasons for what you did.”

Female friends: Is dating a very nice she-wolf who has a booming career in real estate. Big Bad Wolf hopes something will come of it. Her family is a bit upset about his prison record, but she finds him brooding and mysterious and is probably more attracted to him because of his dangerous reputation than for his actual personality.

Enemies: Little Pig has always hated him for murdering his two brothers. It was Little Pig’s weeping testimony on the witness stand that helped put Big Bad Wolf in prison.

Worst childhood memory: His favorite uncle was lynched by a mob of angry woodsmen after having lunch with Little Red’s grandmother. Big Bad Wolf knows his uncle was guilty, but even so, he feels that the woodsmen were way out of line and should have waited for the court to exact justice. Big Bad Wolf despises lynch mobs.

One-line characterization: A dangerous-looking wolf with a soft heart.

Strongest character trait: Speaks impulsively and sometimes uses frightening language because he tends to exaggerate.

Weakest character trait: Tends to be too honest and forthright when giving his opinion, so he sometimes unknowingly hurts people’s feelings.

Greatest hope: He wants to discover fresh new talent among the younger generation of writers.

Deepest fear: He fears that he will give in to the violent impulses of his wolfish nature.

How character sees self: A friendly, engaging, intelligent, but highly misunderstood wolf.

How others see character: A terrifying, sarcastic, unempathetic, dangerous wolf.





Little Pig

Age: 64

Height: 4’3”

Weight: 300 pounds

Ethnic heritage: Pig

Sense of humor: Little Pig is overly serious and never jokes.

Personality type: Driver analytic

Hobbies: He has an outstanding stamp collection, which he pays an assistant to keep up to date.

Favorite music: A big fan of Wagner

Favorite books: Any books on business management. How to Win Friends and Influence Enemies.

Favorite movies: Documentaries

Favorite colors: Pink

Description of home: Little Pig once had a fine brick home that he built himself. Later, as his business took off, he moved into a mansion in a gated community that has its own golf course. He doesn’t use most of the rooms, but he has a few servants who live there and keep the place up—a butler, a cook, and a housekeeper.

Educational background: Harvard Business School

Work experience: Little Pig started a business selling straw, sticks, and bricks early in life with his brothers. Later, they moved into building supplies and created a chain of stores that competes with Home Depot and Lowe’s, but targets contractors, not do-it-yourselfers. They then branched out into pharmaceuticals, where they made a killing. Little Pig became CEO after the tragic murder of his brothers.

Family: Little Pig’s parents died many years ago, leaving him and his two brothers to fend for themselves. They began a business together, and it grew rapidly. After the tragic murder of Little Pig’s brothers, the business grew exponentially under his leadership. Little Pig never married, but one of his brothers left a wife and a son (Tiny Pig). Tiny Pig grew up affluent and is a spoiled brat.

Best friend: Friends? Little Pig has no friends. But he has a lot of competitors.

Enemies: Little Pig’s only enemies were his brothers, who were ruining the family business. So Little Pig killed them and inherited the stock of one of them and got full control of the company. His nephew Tiny Pig has now grown up and has a one-third share in the company, which earns him some dividends, but that’s not enough for him. He wants a cushy job that will pay a high salary, and Little Pig knows he’s incompetent, so he refuses to give him any sort of position in the company. Tiny is faced with having to sell off stock to maintain his lifestyle. But Tiny stands to inherit from Little Pig, and when he figures out that Little Pig killed his father, he decides to kill two birds with one stone.

Best childhood memory: Little Pig loved to wallow in the mud on long summer afternoons with his brothers when he was a small child.

Worst childhood memory: Little Pig often heard terrifying tales as a child about the legendary Big Bad Wolf who huffed and puffed and blew down houses. Little Pig had nightmares about the Big Bad Wolf. When he finally met a wolf who was big and bad, it was an easy thing to use him as the fall guy for the murder of Little Pig’s brothers.

One-line characterization: Little Pig is a male chauvinist pig, a psychopath who has got where he is by stepping on the hands of those below him on the ladder of success, and by pulling down those above.

Strongest character trait: Little Pig always gets what he wants, because he thinks that everybody has a price and everybody can be bought.

Weakest character trait: Little Pig lacks empathy and can’t put himself inside the skin of anyone else. So he’s completely unfit to be a novelist.

Greatest hope: Little Pig wants to be famous as a captain of industry and a great novelist—a multitalented but humble self-made pig.

Deepest fear: Little Pig is afraid that somebody will learn his deepest secret—that he killed his own brothers.

Philosophy of life: Take what you can! Give nothing back!

How character sees self: A self-made pig who pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and made a success from very humble beginnings.

How others see character: An arrogant, self-absorbed, egotistical pig who thinks he can buy everything and everyone.

How character will change: He’ll be killed.





Tiny Pig

Age: 24

Height: 3’8”

Weight: 280 pounds

Ethnic heritage: Pig

Color of hair: Tiny is bald.

Color of eyes: Pink

Style of dressing: Pigs don’t wear clothes. Tiny sometimes wears a nice sport jacket.

Sense of humor: He loves frat-boy humor. Nothing is funnier than dumping a pitcher of beer on your best buddy while he’s getting friendly with his girlfriend on the couch.

Personality type: Expressive expressive

Hobbies: Drinking, playing pool, gambling, chasing girls

Favorite music: Hip-hop

Favorite books: Tiny is pretty sure he’s NEVER read a book.

Favorite movies: Animal House—it’s a documentary!

Description of home: Tiny grew up in a luxurious mansion, compliments of his trust fund. Now that money is running low, he’s scaled back to a very expensive apartment with all the goodies.

Educational background: Tiny skated through high school and college. He thinks he majored in business administration, but he’s not actually sure.

Work experience: Frankly, there just aren’t a lot of job opportunities for kids from well-to-do families. Business owners tend to hate those types and only give jobs to impoverished kids willing to work for minimum wage. So Tiny has had to struggle against discrimination all his life and has never actually had a job. But he’s looking, and he’s quite sure that an upper-level management position in his uncle’s business would be just the thing for him. But his uncle is being such a tightwad and keeps asking stupid questions like what can Tiny actually DO for the company.

Family: Tiny’s father was murdered when Tiny was a teenager, and the Big Bad Wolf was convicted. Tiny’s mother was a wealthy socialite, much younger than his father, and she wasn’t much fazed by the death of her husband. Tiny is an only child, and now that he’s an adult, he doesn’t keep much track of his mother anymore, except on holidays.

Best friend: Tiny has just a huge raft of friends he knew in college. They had the absolute BEST time in their fraternity. Most of the guys have gotten jobs now or else are still in school trying to find themselves. Great guys, all of them, and Tiny was always free to give them money when they were in a pinch. But now he’s in a pinch, and it’s very strange, but none of his friends have anything to spare for him. The economy, you know.

Strongest character trait: Tiny is very generous with his money. Always has been. He’s also very gregarious and knows lots of people and loves to hang out with them at parties. He’s extremely popular and is considered a success with the ladies.

Weakest character trait: Tiny just doesn’t like to work hard. He’s TALENTED, you know, and talented people can get by without grinding it out.

Greatest hope: Tiny wants to take over the company his father and uncles founded and become the next CEO. He hopes to become an industrial magnate and possibly go into politics someday.

Deepest fear: Tiny is terrified of being poor and having to work hard. That’s just not what talented pigs do, and it’s way beneath him.

Male friends: Too many to count. Everybody Tiny knew in college was his friend.

Female friends: Too many to count. Every girl he knew in college was looking for a good time, and he was only too happy to give it to them.

Enemies: Tiny can’t think of a single person who hates him. Although his uncle, Little Pig, doesn’t seem to appreciate his amazing talents, but that doesn’t really count as an enemy. Tiny visited his uncle recently to ask for a job. At dinner, Little Pig let slip something that proved to Tiny that he murdered Tiny’s father. And Tiny realizes that if he kills Little Pig, he can not only avenge his father’s death but also inherit the business and get the cushy job he wants.

Best childhood memory: Tiny remembers the many great parties his parents used to throw when he was a small pig. Tiny would spy on the adults and sneak drinks of the punch and enjoy the atmosphere.

Worst childhood memory: Tiny used to have to visit his grandparents on Thanksgiving and listen to long, boring stories about growing up poor and having to scrabble for a living. Who would want to live like that?

One-line characterization: Tiny believes he’s the most talented person on the planet and that he deserves all the good things without having to work hard.

How character sees self: A brilliant, gifted pig who’s had some setbacks in life but has risen above those by the sheer force of talent.

How others see character: A lazy trust-fund pig with an entitlement mentality and no work ethic at all.



Philosophy of life: Life is great, so enjoy it, because you deserve it, you talented thing, you.

Height: 4’9”

Weight: 150 pounds

Color of hair: Gray

Color of eyes: Light blue

Physical description: Mother Hubbard is a stooped but vigorous old woman with a gleam in her eye.

Description of home: Alas, her home is pretty bare. It has a thin, worn carpet in the small living room. The kitchen has old linoleum and plain, unvarnished cabinets. The cupboard is also plain and unvarnished, and it’s quite bare.

Educational background: Mother Hubbard graduated from high school and got married. That was just what you DO back when she was young, and she doesn’t see why these young girls want to go off and get schooling and wait years and years to get married and have babies, because it just doesn’t make any SENSE.

Work experience: None. Mother Hubbard has never worked outside the home. Her husband had a job years ago, but then he left her a widow. She has a small pension, and that’s really all she needs.

Family: Mother Hubbard is a widow with five children who have now all grown up and established their own homes. They still care about her, but they’re busy and she doesn’t see much of them.

Worst childhood memory: Mother Hubbard grew up in a poor family, and the cupboard was always bare.

Greatest hope: Mother Hubbard hopes to become fabulously wealthy someday.

Deepest fear: That the cupboard will always be bare.

This is a “business parable”—a nonfiction teaching tool wickedly disguised as fiction. Names, characters, corporations, and government entities are either entirely imaginary or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, corporations, or government entities is just a coincidence and doesn't mean a blessed thing.





Acknowledgments


Thanks to Angie Hunt, whose question about “metaphors for writing your first draft” prompted me to dash out an analogy to the snowflake fractal back in the summer of 2002. And thanks to Janelle Schneider, the first person to see how amazingly popular the Snowflake Method would someday become.
