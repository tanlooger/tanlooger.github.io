title: Chapter 9 Your Second Disaster and Your Moral Premise
---

GOLDILOCKS HEADED TOWARD the cafeteria, hoping to find a quiet spot in a corner where she could eat lunch without the Big Bad Wolf seeing her.

But just as she reached the cafeteria door, she felt a tap on her shoulder.

“Oh, my!” She spun around.

The Big Bad Wolf was grinning at her. “I’ve been looking all over for you, Blondie. Let’s go to lunch. I’m famished.”

“L-lunch?” Goldilocks wanted to say that she’d really rather eat in the cafeteria. That she didn’t want to go anywhere with a convicted murderer. But somehow, she just couldn’t get the words out.

“At Barbie’s Barbecue House,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Did you forget? We’ve got reservations in fifteen minutes, so we need to hurry.”

“O-okay.” Goldilocks meekly followed the Big Bad Wolf through the lunch crowd and up the walk and past the coffee shop and into the parking lot and all the way to his car. Her stomach churned with fear, but she got in. The car was a long, shiny black Lincoln rental with a leather interior and powerful air-conditioning.

The Big Bad Wolf handed Goldilocks his phone and asked her to navigate.

She felt cold sweat spring up all over her body. She was really doing this. She was driving away from the conference with a complete stranger, a convicted murderer. A wolf who talked casually about eating people.

And why? Just because he was a big-shot literary agent? Because she was too polite to back out? Because she couldn’t say no? Why couldn’t she learn to be a little more assertive?

Goldilocks discreetly felt inside her purse and fingered her pepper spray. She had taken a training course only a few weeks ago. If he tried anything, she’d spray him right in the eyes and then scream for help.

The Big Bad Wolf spent the entire drive complaining about an editor who had called him during the break to renegotiate a non-compete clause for an author who was working with two different publishers and doing some indie work on the side. He sounded very angry and bared his teeth when he said that some editors weren’t good for anything except a three-hour lunch.

Goldilocks felt more and more frightened as they drove. She could see that Little Pig was right. The Big Bad Wolf was tough and brash and quite possibly dangerous. He was going to ask about her characters, and she was going to have to tell him that she had turned Henri into a wimp.

Could she change Henri back into a one-dimensional villain?

No, she could not. Baby Bear had been right. Great villains needed to be three-dimensional. She had made Henri three-dimensional, and she was not going to change him back.

Could she bend the truth and tell the Big Bad Wolf what he wanted to hear?

No, never. The Big Bad Wolf would be furious if he took her on as a client and then found out she’d lied to him.

He wasn’t going to like her villain, and she was just going to have to tell him. For once in her life, Goldilocks was going to have to stand up for herself. She liked who her villain was becoming, and if the Big Bad Wolf didn’t like it, then he was the wrong agent for her.

“There’s the place.” Goldilocks pointed at the barbecue house. It looked magnificent. “You said it was a little hole in the wall.”

The Big Bad Wolf grinned and showed all his teeth. “Didn’t want you to be disappointed. It’s getting great reviews, so I expect it’s fantastic. And lunch is on me, of course—business expense.”

Goldilocks wasn’t sure what to say, so she said, “Thank you.” But she knew the wolf would hate her when he found out that he had bought lunch for a very unsuitable client.

Five minutes later, they were inside the restaurant. The Big Bad Wolf ordered pork ribs. “As rare as possible,” he told the waiter.

“And I’ll have mine well done,” Goldilocks said.

The waiter disappeared, and the Big Bad Wolf studied Goldilocks intently. “Baby Bear texted me that the class helped you work on your characters before lunch. Bring me up to speed. I like your story, but characters sell a book to an editor.”

Goldilocks felt her heart hammering. “I don’t know where to begin.”

“Start with your heroine.”

“We didn’t really talk much about Elise—”

“Good, no point in that. You’ve probably spent ten years thinking about Elise. I bet she’s a lot like you, and you know her inside out.”

Goldilocks nodded. “So we spent some time talking about my hero, Dirk Steele.”

The Big Bad Wolf nodded. “What’s he most afraid of?”

“He’s not afraid of anything.”

“Everybody’s afraid of something.”

“What are you afraid of?”

He looked shocked for a moment, and a haunted look came into his eyes. Then he shook his head and gave her a wolfish grin. “Nice try, but let’s stick to your novel. I want to hear about Dirk. What’s he afraid of?”

Goldilocks spent a few minutes spinning out a tale of how Dirk had been bitten by a rat when he was very young, and so now he was afraid of rats.

The Big Bad Wolf didn’t say much.

Goldilocks thought he looked rather disappointed, but reading a wolf’s expression was much harder than reading a human’s.

The waiter came with their food, and they both dug in.

The Big Bad Wolf turned out to have excellent manners. Goldilocks had wondered if maybe he’d eat like a dog, gnawing at his food and chomping noisily, but he ate with the polished precision of a Boston blueblood. He asked Goldilocks what her personal vision was.

“I just … want to be a best-selling novelist. I want people to know my name.”

The Big Bad Wolf was nodding. “Sounds like the theme song from Fame.”

Goldilocks felt her cheeks burning. “I suppose that’s very shallow of me.”

“No, no, not at all,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “The big drivers for most people are power, money, sex, or fame. Personally, fame is what drives me. Ten years from now, I want people to hear my name and think, ‘The world’s best literary agent.’”

“You’ll get there,” Goldilocks said. “What could possibly stop you?”

The Big Bad Wolf looked so desperately sad for a moment that Goldilocks wanted to cry. “Is something wrong?” she asked.

He shook his head fiercely. “We’re getting off track. Tell me about your villain. This Henri person. What makes him tick?”

Goldilocks felt just a little dizzy. The Big Bad Wolf wasn’t going to like what she had to say. She reminded herself that it was his problem, and then began talking about Henri. His difficult childhood. His harassment by school bullies. His disappointment at not being a real soldier during the Great War. His wife and child. His emptiness after they died. His shame at collaborating with the Nazis, and his loneliness when the villagers shunned him. And how much he loved Elise’s daughter, Monique, the only person who treated him as if he were a real person.

She spent the whole time looking at her food, afraid to meet the Big Bad Wolf’s eyes.

When she finished, there was dead silence.

Goldilocks looked at the Big Bad Wolf.

He was scowling.

“Is something wrong?” Goldilocks couldn’t seem to catch her breath. Little Pig had been right. He hated it.

“This is going to completely change your story,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “You do understand that, don’t you?”

Goldilocks felt her heart double-thump. “If you don’t like it, I’m sorry I wasted your time. But my heart tells me this is the right direction, and I’m not going to …” She sucked in her breath. “I’m not going to change it.”

The Big Bad Wolf narrowed his eyes.

Goldilocks wanted to die. “Can I just explain why, before you reject me? Baby Bear made me put myself in Henri’s shoes. So I asked myself how he could look in the mirror every morning and not shoot himself. And I realized that everybody, even the worst villain, sees themselves as the hero of their story. And once I did that, I saw that there was more to Henri than just a wicked villain. Baby Bear was right, and I was wrong. So don’t try to change my mind. And I’ll … I’ll pay for my own lunch.”

Tears began streaming out of the Big Bad Wolf’s eyes.

Goldilocks was so astonished she didn’t know what to think.

“I love what you’ve done with Henri.” The Big Bad Wolf smeared the back of his paw across his eyes. “You can’t imagine what it’s like being the villain of a story and having everyone hate you.”

Goldilocks could imagine. She was very lucky that Papa Bear didn’t know the identity of the anonymous little girl in his novel. She put her hand on the Big Bad Wolf’s paw and patted it gently. “I … guess I don’t follow the news,” Goldilocks said. “But it sounds like you were once accused of … murder?”

“Double murder,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Years ago. I didn’t do it, but try telling anybody that. My uncle had been a notorious murderer. You must have heard about Little Red’s grandmother?”

“Oh, my!” Goldilocks had grown up hearing about Little Red and the wolf who ate her grandmother. All over Goldilocks’s body, her skin felt cold. She couldn’t think what to say.

“Ten years ago, I was accused of murdering two little pigs,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “I was asleep when it happened, at home in my bed. Somehow, I slept for twenty-four hours straight, which is totally out of character for me. But I couldn’t prove it, and there were wolf tracks at the murder scene that matched me perfectly. I was convicted on circumstantial evidence and sent to prison.”

Goldilocks remembered vaguely hearing something about that. She had been in college, and the murder of two little pigs by some evil wolf had seemed far away and unimportant.

The Big Bad Wolf looked at her with huge, mournful eyes.

Goldilocks wanted to cry. “And now you can’t ever live that down.”

He shook his head. “No, I can’t. I was framed and I came from a bad family, with an infamous uncle who had my exact same name. The jury came in believing I was guilty. I had a lousy public defender and no alibi, and I never had a chance.”

Goldilocks believed him. She couldn’t quite say why, but she felt absolutely certain that he’d been framed.

“Baby Bear thinks I’ve reformed,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “But he’s wrong. I was never a murderer in the first place.”

“I believe you,” said Goldilocks. “You talk rough and you say frightening things, but I think it’s just an act. I think you’re really a very kind and gentle wolf.”

The Big Bad Wolf growled and showed his teeth. “Don’t you dare tell a soul, or the editors will stop being afraid of me.”

Goldilocks laughed.

“So. Back to your novel,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “You’ve completely changed your villain. That’s going to have major repercussions.”

“Little Pig says I’ve ruined my story,” Goldilocks said.

The Big Bad Wolf snorted. “Nonsense. Ignore that bacon-brained idiot. He doesn’t know anything about fiction. You’ve changed your story, and it’s going to be a lot better. But now you need to rethink everything.”

“So … you’re still interested in me?” Goldilocks couldn’t believe it. “You looked angry when I told you what I’d come up with for Henri.”

The Big Bad Wolf grinned and leaned forward. “Hope I didn’t scare you, but I had to see what you were made of. I like a writer who can stand up for herself, be true to her story.”

“R-really?” Goldilocks stared at him. “But I thought you liked … you know, strong villains.”

“Oh, I do, I do,” the Big Bad Wolf said. “And Henri is turning out a lot stronger than I expected. The way you were talking yesterday, he was this seedy little two-dimensional, boring villain who is bad just because he likes to be bad.”

“But you didn’t say anything yesterday.”

“That’s why I invited you to lunch. To discuss the problems I was seeing. But it looks like you’ve got your story back on track. So tell me about Henri’s Values.”

“Nothing is more important than life. And nothing is more important than honor.”

“Honor?” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Talk to me about honor. That’s a very big Value among wolves. In fact, for a wolf, absolutely nothing is more important than honor. It’s our preeminent cultural Value. Not so much among humans.”

“Well, if you ever read The Godfather, you’d know that some humans have honor as their highest Value,” said Goldilocks.

Surprise slashed across the Big Bad Wolf’s face. “You’ve read The Godfather?”

“It’s … one of my favorite books.” Goldilocks blushed. “I suppose that makes me a bad person.”

“It’s one of my favorite books too.” The Big Bad Wolf leaned forward, and he studied Goldilocks intently. “What do you like about The Godfather?”

“I always thought it was just amazing how Mario Puzo created a compelling character who’s so evil, and yet thinks he’s so good. And he is good in a twisted kind of way. He helps poor widows without asking for payment. He rights wrongs done to his people. He protects the sons of his community from being drafted. As long as they pay him honor. That’s the whole basis of his wealth—his honor. Without honor, he’d be nothing.”

“Which is what drives the story, when his oldest son shows him dishonor,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “How does honor drive Henri in your story?”

“He’s been dishonored all his life. As a child. In school. In the army. After the Great War, the townspeople spit in his path because he worked for a criminal. And then the Nazis took over France, and he collaborated with them out of fear, but they didn’t respect him, because he was a traitor. Henri has spent his whole life being dissed by everybody for being a wimp, and he thinks he’s more than that.”

“And so what is his Ambition?”

“He wants to be respected. He wants to be a man of honor.”

“Good, that’s abstract,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “It makes a good Ambition. How can you turn that into a concrete Goal? What would it look like for him to be a man of honor?”

“What he desperately wants is to do something great. Something noble. Something that means something. Something that will atone for his past life of collaboration.”

“That’s all abstract. What could he do, after a lifetime of being a weasel?”

Goldilocks felt her heart thumping. “He could blow up the ammo dump. When Dirk and Elise fail, he could blow it up himself.”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” said the Big Bad Wolf. “I thought you killed Henri at the end of Act 1. What’s he doing still alive at the end of your story?”

“Oh, well, I was going to tell you that,” said Goldilocks. “I can’t kill him at the end of Act 1.”

“Give me your new one-paragraph summary, and I want three good, solid, screaming disasters.”

Goldilocks took out her laptop. “Actually, this is all so new that I haven’t written any of it down. Can I type it out as I talk?”

The Big Bad Wolf nodded. “Whatever works for you.”

Goldilocks opened her one-paragraph summary document, made a copy, and then retyped it as she talked.

“Elise Renoir is a young widow in Nazi-occupied France, and Dirk Steele is an American saboteur who parachutes into her backyard and breaks his leg, three weeks before D-Day. Elise cares for Dirk for a week, but then her unwanted suitor Henri discovers them, and threatens to turn in Dirk to the authorities unless Elise agrees to marry him. Elise sends her daughter Monique away to a remote village for a few weeks, planning to join her after helping Dirk blow up his target, but Monique is captured by the Nazis, who intend to send her to a death camp. Elise joins forces with the Resistance and persuades Henri to help her and Dirk ambush Monique’s transport truck, but in the fighting, Dirk is fatally wounded. Dirk and Elise take the truck to the ammo dump, evading Nazis all the way, and blow it up the day before the Allied invasion begins.”

The Big Bad Wolf was smiling. “I like it. This is a stronger story. In this version, you’ve got Elise joining the Resistance. What happened there? She was afraid to do that before.”

“She realized that living in fear just leads to disaster, so she decided to try living in courage and see if that leads to victory.”

“Yes!” shouted the Big Bad Wolf. He jumped out of his chair and began dancing around, raising his arms in the air. “Touchdown!”

The other diners were staring at him and Goldilocks.

She decided she didn’t care. Something had just happened. She wasn’t quite sure what, but it sounded like she’d made a breakthrough.

The Big Bad Wolf sat down. “I think you’ve just found the Moral Premise for your story.”

“The what?” Goldilocks said, feeling slightly offended. “I’m not trying to write some cheap little morality tale.”

“Of course not,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “But every good story has a Moral Premise. You can read all about it in the book The Moral Premise by Stan Williams. The basic idea is that in the first half of the story, the lead character lives by a false Moral Premise, and reaps the results.”

“So Elise’s false Moral Premise is …?”

“That she has to live in fear to be safe,” said the Big Bad Wolf.

“But living in fear leads to disaster.”

The Big Bad Wolf nodded. “And as a result of the second disaster—right at the midpoint of the story—the lead character changes to a true Moral Premise. She decides that she can live by courage.”

“Which leads to victory.”

“Yes. Not necessarily a victory in the outer sense,” said the Big Bad Wolf. “Elise may fail to get back her daughter. She may fail to blow up the ammo dump. She may even fail to survive. But the important thing is that she is a victor in her soul. Virtue is its own reward.”

Goldilocks thought it was very odd to be hearing about virtue from a wolf who was a convicted murderer.

The Big Bad Wolf was smiling. “This is so much fun. There’s nothing I like more than helping a writer find her story.” He looked at his watch. “Unfortunately, we need to get back to the conference. But let me be clear—I love where your story is going. You’ve made some dramatic progress today.”

“And now I’ve got a lot of work ahead of me,” said Goldilocks.

After she fixed her villain, her story had changed radically.

Which meant she now had to rethink everything.

She was going to give Baby Bear an earful about this.

If his Snowflake Method was so good, then why did she have to make all these changes to her story?
