title: Chapter 18 Writing Your Novel
---

BABY BEAR GRINNED at the class. “It’s time now for the tenth step of the Snowflake Method. This is the one that will take the most time to do, but it’s the quickest to explain.”

He went to the whiteboard and wrote:





STEP 10 OF THE SNOWFLAKE





Write the first scene of your novel.

Don’t stop writing scenes until you’re done.





He spun around and faced the class. “If you’ve done step 8, then you have a complete list of scenes for your novel. If you’ve done step 9, then you’ve planned each scene and you know in advance that it will move your story forward because it’s either a Proactive Scene or a Reactive Scene. You are now ready to write your novel. So go do it.”

He took a small bow.

The minute hand on the clock ticked over to the top of the hour.

The bell rang outside in the hallway.

The class erupted into cheers.

Goldilocks hurried to Baby Bear and wrapped him up in a giant hug. She hugged the Big Bad Wolf. She hugged Mrs. Hubbard. She even hugged Robin Hood, even though he smelled like a gallon of ale.

“Awesome wench,” he said. “I mean chick! Not wench, chick.”

Everybody was talking at once.

The Big Bad Wolf clapped a furry paw on Goldilocks’s shoulder. “Well, Blondie, the ball is in your court. You’re a different woman than the one who walked in here a few days ago. Are you ready to write your novel?”

“I’m totally ready,” Goldilocks said. “I can’t wait.”

That evening, after the children were in bed, Goldilocks sat down at her computer and opened her novel in her word processor and looked at what she’d written so far. There was only one word typed. “The.”

Goldilocks deleted it.

And began typing madly.

Dirk Steele gripped the hard metal seat with one hand and tightened the straps of his chute with the other. The plane was bucking and jumping like a rodeo bull. “How much farther to the drop zone?”

The jumpmaster finished vomiting into a small paper bag. “About five minutes, if—”

Another anti-aircraft round exploded outside, so close it felt like a hammer had smashed Dirk directly on the eardrum.

The rear gunner cursed. “And now we’ve got Jerry on our tail!”

The plane dove toward the earth, jerking and jinking wildly.

The sound of a machine gun clattered behind them.

“Almost there!” screamed the pilot. “Prepare for—”

Something slammed into the right wing.

A horrific explosion shook the entire plane.

“Out now!” The jumpmaster staggered to the side door and flung it open. “Dirk, get out—now, now, now!”

Dirk dove through the door, praying that his chute would do its duty.

The freezing airstream slammed him with a giant fist, spinning him like a top.

A German fighter plane sped by, machine guns blazing.

A flash like lightning.

An explosion like thunder.

A shock wave like a cement truck.

For a few seconds, Dirk couldn’t breathe.

He opened his eyes and looked back to see who else had made it out of the plane.

The last thing he saw before he dropped into the clouds was …

Nothing.

Fear hit Dirk like a hammer.

The plane was gone.

The night sky was empty.

The other nine commandos, the jumpmaster, the rear gunner, the pilot, the copilot—all dead.

He was alone, ten thousand feet above France, dropping like a rock toward a region teeming with half a million German soldiers.

Dirk felt for the duffel bag of explosives strapped to his chest. It would not be enough to take out the target.

The mission was one hour old, and already it had failed.

Goldilocks finished typing and looked at her watch. In eighteen minutes, she had written 314 words.

She jumped up and began dancing in a little circle.

Baby Bear’s Snowflake Method was just right.
