title: Chapter 3 Your Story in One Sentence

BUT GOLDILOCKS FOUND it impossible to sneak away. During the break, she was mobbed by other students, all asking her how long she had been writing and what were her secrets for being so brilliant.

Goldilocks had no idea what to tell them, so she sipped coffee and shrugged mysteriously. Even when she went to the ladies’ room, she was surrounded by her new friends, who would not stop talking. She felt like a terrible fraud. If these writers learned that she had only written one word in her novel, they’d know she was nothing but an airhead.

When the class resumed, the room was buzzing with excitement.

Goldilocks felt like the world’s biggest phony.

Baby Bear told Goldilocks to sit in the chair in front again, and then he began pacing in front of her.

“In our last session, we talked about your target audience—what kind of story delights them. And we imagined a specific young woman who happens to be in your target audience. Can you see her in your mind’s eye?”

Goldilocks nodded. The young woman looked a lot like her.

Baby Bear was smiling. “Now this woman asks the store owner if there’s anything good that she might like to read. And the owner takes her to your book and says that he has a new book that just arrived, and it’s about … what?”

Goldilocks didn’t know what to say. “It’s a romantic suspense novel and she’ll love it.”

Baby Bear nodded slowly. “That’s a good start. It’s romantic suspense. But it’s not enough to tell a customer she’s going to love your book. You have to show her that she’s going to love your book.”

“Oh, well …” Goldilocks fanned her face. “How do I do that?”

“You give her a taste of the story in twenty-five words or less.”

Goldilocks thought for a minute. “Okay, so my story’s about this young woman living in France in World War II, and her husband went off to the war years ago and was killed, and she has a young daughter, and she’s just scraping by growing roots and things in the garden, and she’s horribly afraid the Nazis will take her daughter away because they’ll say she’s defective, and there’s this nasty old Nazi sympathizer in the village who’s been making advances to her, and she knows that if she turns him down, he might tell the Nazis about her daughter, but he’s just so repulsive that she can’t stand him, and when she complains to the mayor, he tells her that we all have to make hard choices, and—”

“Wasn’t there a handsome young American agent parachuting into her life?” Baby Bear asked.

Goldilocks put her hands on her hips and glared at him. “I’m getting to that! But first I have to tell you all the things you need to know to understand my story.”

Baby Bear looked out at the class. “How many of you need to know everything that Goldilocks just told you?”

A few students timidly raised their hands halfway.

Goldilocks couldn’t understand why they had all lost enthusiasm. Fifteen minutes ago, they’d all thought her story sounded amazing.

“What you’re telling us is called backstory,” Baby Bear said. “We want to hear the real story.”

“But … you have to know all this first,” Goldilocks said.

“Did you ever read The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth?” Baby Bear asked.

“Yes, a long time ago. I loved that book.”

“What’s it about?”

“Well, it’s a thriller about a professional assassin hired by French terrorists to kill Charles de Gaulle.”

Baby Bear was counting on his paws as he mumbled to himself. When he finished, he grinned at her and said, “Sixteen.”

“What?” Goldilocks stared at him.

“You summarized the whole story in sixteen words. You told me the category and told me enough of the story to get me interested.” Baby Bear turned to the students. “How many of you would buy that book right now if I had it here for sale?”

Six hands shot up.

“What’s the title again?” shouted one student.

“Who’s the author?” said another.

Baby Bear pointed at the six students with their hands up. “You people are in the target audience for The Day of the Jackal. Goldilocks just summarized the story in exactly the form you need in order to know that you would love the story. Well done!”

Goldilocks hung her head modestly. She hadn’t done anything special. The story was a good one, and she’d just told the barest essentials.

“Now quickly,” Baby Bear said. “For those six students who just raised their hands, how would you summarize your book?”

“Well, isn’t it obvious?” Goldilocks couldn’t believe that Baby Bear wasn’t getting it. “I’m writing a romantic suspense novel about a woman in Nazi-occupied France who falls in love with an American saboteur on a mission to, um, do something really super horrible to the Nazis that will change the course of the war.”

For a minute, there had been real tension hanging in the air. But right after Goldilocks had said the word “um,” the excitement seemed to drain out of the room in a whoosh.

Goldilocks made a mental note to never say “um” again.

Baby Bear was smiling though, pacing back and forth. “That was an excellent start. You told us the category. I can see the woman. I can see the saboteur. But I can’t see his mission.”

Goldilocks frowned at him. “It’s really important. It’s huge. It could change the war. Don’t you get it?” She couldn’t believe that the conference director would hire a teacher who had so little understanding of fiction.

Baby Bear shook his head. “You can tell me that it’s important and huge and will change the war. But I don’t feel any of that just because you told me. I have to reach that conclusion myself. So you have to show me it’s huge and important.”

“But … in The Day of the Jackal, that’s what happened. The assassin was going to shoot Charles de Gaulle, and that would have changed everything in France.”

Baby Bear turned to the class. “How many of you can picture an assassin shooting Charles de Gaulle?”

Every hand in the room went up.

“How many of you can picture a man doing something really super horrible to the French government?”

All the hands went down.

Baby Bear looked at Goldilocks. “The act of shooting Charles de Gaulle is concrete. We can see him pull the trigger. We can hear the rifle shot. We can feel the boom. We can smell the gunpowder. And we know without you telling us that this is going to badly damage the French government.”

“So … what’s your point?” Goldilocks asked.

“The act of ‘doing something super horrible’ is abstract. We can’t see it, because there are a million super horrible things it could be, and they all look different. We can’t hear it. We can’t smell it. We can’t feel it.”

The class was silent for about ten seconds.

Goldilocks was so angry she wanted to stomp out of the room. Why was Baby Bear being so obtuse? “I keep telling you and you won’t listen! I’m writing a romantic suspense novel about a woman in Nazi-occupied France who falls in love with an injured American saboteur who wants to blow up a key ammunition depot at Normandy just before D-Day.”

All the students stood up and began cheering.

Baby Bear clapped his paws together and pranced around Goldilocks in a circle. “That sounds brilliant, Goldilocks.”

Little Pig harrumphed. “That was thirty-five words. You said it had to be twenty-five words or less.”

Mrs. Hubbard raised her hand. “Wouldn’t it be better if you put in something about a cupboard?”

Baby Bear shook his head. “It could be a little shorter, Little Pig, but I think it works. And Mrs. Hubbard, this story has no cupboards. Goldilocks, I think you’ve nailed this one. You didn’t tell us that the stakes are high. You showed us. If this saboteur blows up all the German ammo, then it hurts the Nazis badly. But if he fails, it could allow them to repel the coming invasion. Very good. There are consequences for both success and failure.”

Goldilocks felt like her story had suddenly come into focus. She had known that her hero was on a mission to strike a terrible blow against the Nazis. But until she spelled out exactly what the mission was, her story had too many possible directions. Now she had fewer options, and she suddenly felt like this story would almost write itself.

Baby Bear stepped to the whiteboard and began writing:





YOUR ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY





Give yourself one hour for this task.

Write one sentence that tells the following: What category your book is.

Who your lead characters are.

What one thing they desperately want to do.





Don’t tell any backstory.

Paint a picture for your target audience.

Be as short as possible, but no shorter.





Beneath that, he wrote Goldilocks’s one-sentence summary:





A romantic suspense novel about a woman in Nazi-occupied France who falls in love with an injured American saboteur on a mission to blow up a key ammunition depot at Normandy just before D-Day.





He counted the words. “Thirty-six. I don’t think you can make it shorter. Congratulations, Goldilocks. You’re ready to move on to the next step in writing your novel.”

Goldilocks felt confusion wash through her. “But … what does this have to do with writing? You said this is just a marketing tagline. Why aren’t you teaching us how to write a novel?”

Baby Bear grinned at her. “The first person you have to market to is yourself. You have to be excited about your story. Which means you have to know what your story is. This is huge progress.”

“But … I haven’t written anything yet! All we have is one crummy sentence.”

“It’s a very good sentence, and it’s one sentence more than you had an hour ago,” Baby Bear said.

Little Pig stood up and cleared his throat, punching numbers furiously on a calculator. “At this rate, it will take you … 2,778 hours to write your novel. That’s 116 straight days, if you work around the clock without eating or sleeping.” He gave a sneer. “Whatever you think you’re doing, Baby Bear, it isn’t working.”
