title: Chapter 14 Your List of Scenes
---

THAT EVENING, AFTER the children went to bed, Goldilocks sat up late thinking. Was there some way to prove that the Big Bad Wolf could not have killed Little Pig?

She opened a document and began typing.

First, she wrote up a character sheet on the Big Bad Wolf. His Goal, she already knew, was to become the world’s greatest literary agent. From that, she could guess his Ambition. He wanted to be an important person in the literary world. She wasn’t sure of his Values, but she made some guesses.

Nothing is more important than survival.

Nothing is more important than honor.

Nothing is more important than helping others.

She couldn’t see how killing Little Pig would be in line with any of those Values.

But that wasn’t proof. That was simply her fuzzy-minded novelist’s brain making an emotional judgment. She was behaving like Mama Bear.

Papa Bear would look at things more rationally. He’d make an outline of the Big Bad Wolf’s life story.

Goldilocks began typing up a rough synopsis of the events in the Big Bad Wolf’s life.

Growing up knowing that his uncle had eaten Little Red’s grandmother. Getting framed for murder. Going to jail because of the lying testimony of Little Pig. Living in fear of the thugs in prison. Learning to be tough to survive. Finally getting paroled. Going out on the streets. Making the decision to become an agent. Attending writer’s conferences. Helping Baby Bear teach his class. Getting into an argument with Little Pig in the coffee shop.

Goldilocks shook her head. Her synopsis was all about actions. It didn’t get inside the skin of the Big Bad Wolf. And it made great leaps from one event to another, without showing the connections.

She was getting a headache and it was very late, and she suddenly realized that she hadn’t yet done her homework. She wanted so very badly to go to bed and sleep and forget everything. But she also wanted very badly to be a novelist. She wanted to complete her novel. She wanted the Big Bad Wolf to be her agent.

She knew that sounded foolish, because everybody said he was a murderer. But she couldn’t shake her belief that deep inside, he had a good, kind heart. Today, he’d been more concerned about her reputation than his.

Goldilocks felt very tired, but she opened her Snowflake document and expanded her one-page synopsis to four pages. Then she rapidly typed out character bibles for her main characters.

By the time she finished, it was after 3:00 a.m., and her head felt muzzy. She staggered into bed and slept like the dead.



* * *



Morning came far too soon. Goldilocks grabbed a hasty breakfast, took her children to school, and raced over to the conference center. She dashed into the classroom five minutes late.

Baby Bear scowled at her. “Well, it seems that everyone is finally here. Let’s begin. But first, a word about what happened yesterday. It looks like I made a terrible error in judgment in inviting the Big Bad Wolf to come help me at this conference. I thought he had reformed, but I was horribly, tragically wrong. I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself, knowing that I’m responsible for the murder of Little Pig.”

“You don’t know that!” Goldilocks said. “The Big Bad Wolf says he didn’t do it.”

“Well, dude, it’s not like he’s going to admit anything,” said Robin Hood. “Of course he claims he didn’t do it. But we know for sure he’s murdered pigs before.”

“He was framed before, and now he’s being framed again,” Goldilocks said stubbornly.

“Oh, like that is totally logical,” Robin Hood sneered.

“I’d think you of all people ought to understand,” Goldilocks said. “Didn’t the Sheriff of Nottingham ever accuse you of something you didn’t do?”

Robin Hood’s mouth fell open. “All the time. He’s, like, the Man, the oppressor of the people.”

“Well, what if the Man is oppressing the Big Bad Wolf? Isn’t that possible?”

Robin Hood just looked at her. “I … suppose it is. That’s what the Man does—oppresses people. And Little Pig, if you ask me, was in the back pocket of the Man. What do we know about him?”

Baby Bear began pacing. “Little Pig was a very wealthy businessman. He started the business years ago with his two brothers, and took over full control after they were tragically murdered. He has no children, but there is a nephew, a young fellow from New York, who has arrived in town and is demanding the death penalty for the Big Bad Wolf.”

“Aren’t there any witnesses?” Goldilocks said. “Maybe a security camera in the coffee shop?”

Baby Bear shook his head. “There’s a security camera trained on the coffee shop back patio, but it’s broken. The conference center isn’t wired, and there weren’t any witnesses.”

“The Big Bad Wolf said he left here only a minute or two before Papa Bear found him in the men’s room,” Goldilocks said. “That’s not enough time to kill Little Pig. Papa Bear was there at the coffee shop. He’d have seen him.”

Robin Hood took an arrow out of his quiver and began tapping the point with his fingers. “We’ve got no proof of when the Big Bad Wolf left. Didn’t anybody see him go out?”

Heads shook all around the room.

“Well, I’m afraid his record is against him,” Mrs. Hubbard said. “If you ask me, a bent tree never grows straight.”

Baby Bear studied Goldilocks for a long moment. “I … suppose not everyone would agree with that. But the fact is that even without hard evidence, any jury is going to convict the Big Bad Wolf just because of who he is. Now, I know this is difficult, but let’s shift gears to talk about writing. Did any of you complete the homework?”

Mrs. Hubbard raised her hand. “I wrote a long character bible on my main character, who is a poor but honest widow. I have an excellent description of her cupboard.”

“Let me guess,” said Robin Hood. “It’s … bare?”

“You’re so smart!” Mrs. Hubbard said admiringly.

“It’s a nice start,” Baby Bear said. “Did you do your other characters?”

“What other characters?” Mrs. Hubbard asked. “I only have the one. The whole story is about her bare cupboard.”

“And did you write a four-page synopsis?” Baby Bear asked.

Mrs. Hubbard sighed deeply. “Young bear, you really are asking a lot. I got my synopsis up to a page and a quarter. There’s only so much you can say about a cupboard.”

“Perhaps what you’ve got there is a short story, rather than a full-length novel,” Baby Bear said. “Who wrote all their character bibles and their four-page synopsis?”

Goldilocks raised her hand, and then looked to see who else had done it.

Not a single other hand was raised.

Mrs. Hubbard was staring at Goldilocks with a look of astonishment.

Robin Hood was studying her appreciatively, his eyes running from her face all the way down her body to her long, slim legs, and then back up again. He winked at her and smiled.

Baby Bear frowned. “There’s a reason only a few writers get their novels published. You need to discipline yourselves to do the work. It’s hard work, but if you don’t do it, you aren’t behaving professionally. Apparently, only one of you has done what’s necessary, and she looks a little ragged today. I was planning to give her a break, but it looks like I don’t have much choice. Goldilocks, please come up to the hot seat.”

Goldilocks staggered a little on the way forward. She hadn’t done much with her hair this morning, and she’d probably done a horrible job on her makeup. Baby Bear must think she was very unprofessional.

“Let me just look at your homework.” Baby Bear pointed to her laptop.

Goldilocks set it on the table. “My documents are both already open.”

Baby Bear skimmed rapidly through her character bible and long synopsis. “Hmmm, this is quite good. Your synopsis is a little thin on the third page. I think you’ll need to beef up the second half of your second act. And your ending feels very rushed.”

“I’m sorry,” Goldilocks said in a quiet voice. “I was trying so hard to think how to help the Big Bad Wolf that I didn’t get started on my homework until after midnight. I was up till 3:00 a.m., and I know everything I wrote must be awful, but—”

“You wrote all this after midnight?” Baby Bear said. “That’s …”

A hiss of astonishment went around the room.

“Amazing,” said a girl in the back row with a pierced eyebrow. “Goldilocks, you’re like a rock star at this writing thing.”

“Goldilocks has a terrific work ethic,” Baby Bear said. “Which is why I think she has a good chance to succeed. This is excellent work, considering that she did it all so late last night. There are some things to improve, but this is the last day of the conference, and we really need to press on. So let’s go to step 8 in the Snowflake Method. We need a list of scenes for her novel.”

Goldilocks felt her head beginning to ache again. More work? Seriously? She massaged the back of her neck and hunched her shoulders. They felt stiff and sore.

“Are you all right, Goldilocks?” Baby Bear asked.

“I … just feel terrible about the Big Bad Wolf,” Goldilocks said. “And my head hurts and my shoulders are sore, and I’m wondering how much more work we have to do before I can start writing my novel.”

Baby Bear gave her a sympathetic look. “I understand. You’re tired, and you want to start writing. But is that realistic? If you started writing your novel today, would you know what to put in the very first scene?”

“No,” Goldilocks said in a dejected voice. “That’s always been my problem. I don’t know how to get beyond the first word in my novel. I suppose I’m just a terrible writer.” She felt so desperately discouraged that she wanted to give up and go home.

“You’re a very good writer,” said Baby Bear. “All you need is a bit more coaching, and things should become clear. Let’s talk about how you’re going to start your story. Your hero, Dirk, is going to break his leg parachuting into Elise’s garden, right?”

“But don’t I need to show all of Dirk’s training as a commando?” Goldilocks said. “And about how Elise became a widow? And about Henri growing up and wanting to be respected by other people?”

“All of that is what we call ‘backstory,’” Baby Bear said. “That’s important information that you need to know so you understand your characters. But it’s not necessary for your reader to know it just yet. You first have to get your target reader to care about your main story. Then she’ll be dying to know your backstory. Your main story begins when Dirk meets Elise.”

“Well, then, since Elise is my main character, shouldn’t I start the first scene with her?”

“You could,” Baby Bear said. “How would that scene look?”

“She’d, um, put her daughter Monique to bed, and then she’d sit quietly knitting by the lamp, and then she’d go to bed, and then around 3:00 a.m. she’d wake up because she heard a noise outside, and she’d go out to look, and there would be Dirk.”

Baby Bear looked around the room. “Sounds pretty exciting, doesn’t it? A quiet evening like every other quiet evening in the life of a lonely young widow. How many of you would find that fun to read?”

The other writers all sat studying their hands. Nobody said anything.

Baby Bear turned to Goldilocks. “Maybe you could start the story with a scene about Monique. Would that work?”

Goldilocks giggled. “But … Monique just plays with her dolls until bedtime and then goes to bed and sleeps all night, and in the morning, she wakes up and Dirk is in the house. That’s not interesting at all.”

“Then we can’t start with her, can we?” said Baby Bear. “Maybe Henri? What was he doing on the night Dirk arrived?”

Goldilocks realized she hadn’t even thought about Henri. But she knew she must. He was an important character. “He went over to court Elise. Monique made him play dolls with her until her bedtime. After that, Henri sat on the love seat and talked about the war while Elise sat in the rocking chair by the kerosene lamp knitting. He wanted her to sit beside him, but she said she needed the light to see. Around midnight, he went home feeling very frustrated, wondering whether Elise really liked him.”

Baby Bear shrugged his furry little shoulders. “Not terribly exciting, is it?”

Goldilocks felt a cold, hard knot forming in her belly. Her novel had seemed so wonderful until she actually tried to plan the first scene. Now it seemed boring.

“Tell me about how Dirk spent the evening,” Baby Bear said.

Goldilocks thought for a few seconds. “It was a cold, rainy night. He and the other commandos dressed up all in black and packed their kits and loaded up into the plane. They were flying very high and very fast, hoping to avoid anti-aircraft fire. They were almost to their jump zone when a German fighter plane started chasing them. The American pilot swooped and dove and tried hard to evade, but the German shot up their wing and the engine caught fire. The commandos all ran to the door to get out. The jumpmaster pushed Dirk out first. Half a second later, the plane exploded above him. He saw plane parts and bodies falling in the light of the moon. Then he dropped into dense clouds. He waited as long as possible before opening his parachute, to avoid being strafed by ground fire. When he came out of the clouds, he was only a thousand feet above the ground. He yanked the ripcord and the chute jerked him upward. He saw that he was drifting toward a fence, and he barely managed to guide his chute into an open garden. The light was bad, and he misjudged the landing and hit hard on his right leg. It buckled, and he collapsed on the ground and lost consciousness.”

The room had gone absolutely silent.

Goldilocks had been staring at her gold-flecked nails while she talked. She looked at Baby Bear.

He was smiling.

She looked at the class.

They were staring at her.

“That’s terrific,” said Baby Bear. “I think you’ve got a killer opening scene. It starts with a clear goal. There’s plenty of conflict all the way through. And it ends with a setback.”

“What do I need to do?” Goldilocks said.

“Open up a spreadsheet on your laptop and make a very wide first column and then type in what happens in the scene,” said Baby Bear.

Goldilocks opened a spreadsheet and started typing. “There’s not enough room here. I can’t put in all those details.”

“Can you summarize the scene in one sentence?” Baby Bear said.

“Yes, of course. Dirk and his fellow commandos are shot up as they near their drop zone, and Dirk breaks his leg when he lands badly in Elise’s garden.”

“Is that enough to remember everything else you said?”

“I’m sure it’ll jog my memory,” said Goldilocks. “That scene would be very hard to forget.”

“Then you don’t need any more than that,” said Baby Bear. “Now your homework is to write one line in the spreadsheet for every scene in your novel. You can work from your long synopsis that you created in step 6 of the Snowflake. Focus on events that happen over a short period of time—minutes or a few hours. Just tell the main thing that happens in each scene.”

“That’s going to be a huge amount of work,” said Mrs. Hubbard. “Why not just start writing?”

“You can just start writing if you want,” said Baby Bear. “But if you don’t know what to start writing yet, creating a scene list will help you figure that out.”

Goldilocks was staring unhappily at her laptop.

“Is something wrong?” Baby Bear asked.

“It’s just … I really hate spreadsheets,” Goldilocks said. “They remind me of that horrible job I used to have. Why not just write all this in a Word document or a text file?”

“That’s a very good question,” said Baby Bear. “The reason is because you’re going to be using more columns in the spreadsheet. Each scene has a point-of-view character. That’s the character whose head you’re going to get inside for that scene. So you need a column in your spreadsheet to tell who the POV character is.”

Goldilocks made a new column in her spreadsheet and typed in “Dirk” in the first row of the column. “Are there going to be any other columns?”

“That’s up to you,” said Baby Bear. “You might want a column that tells you how many words you expect for the scene. A short scene might be only five hundred words. A medium scene might be a thousand. A long scene might be two or even three thousand words.”

“Why would I care about that?” asked Goldilocks.

“Because then you can add up all the numbers and estimate how long your book is going to be.”

Goldilocks stared at him in disbelief. “That’s crazy! I hate adding up numbers. And what if I change one of the numbers? Then I’d have to add them all up again.”

Baby Bear sighed. “One of the things a spreadsheet can do very easily is to add up numbers. You just tell it to do that, and then if you ever change one of the numbers, the spreadsheet will automatically recalculate the total. So you’ll always know how long your novel is planned to be.”

“That’s … amazing!” Goldilocks said. “You’re a genius, Baby Bear.”

Baby Bear looked modestly at the floor. “The nice thing about a spreadsheet is that you can also put in other columns to help you plan your scenes and track progress. You might record how long it took you to write the scene. Or how many words you actually wrote in the scene. And if you have a carefully plotted story where the timing matters very much, like a bank robbery or a murder mystery, you might need a column with time stamps.”

“What’s a time stamp?” asked Mrs. Hubbard.

“It’s the exact time at which the scene happened. When minutes are important and you want to make sure that your timeline is realistic and plausible, you can put the time stamp for each scene in a time stamp column. Mystery writers often need a timeline in their novels to keep everything straight.”

Goldilocks felt her heart start racing. She leaped off of the hot seat and grabbed her purse and went running out of the room.

“Goldilocks, come back!” Baby Bear shouted after her.

But Goldilocks kept running.

Baby Bear had given her an idea.

There might possibly be a way to prove whether the Big Bad Wolf was lying or telling the truth.
