WHEN it comes to Mars, as with any major project, it will take the collective effort of a number of people for that first man or woman to set foot on the Red Planet.

Similarly, the biography of a life as big as that of Elon Musk takes the collective help of several people to achieve.

To Jeremy Boraine, Gill Moodie, Alfred LeMaitre, Martine Barker, Paul Wise, Nicole Duncan and the incredible team at Jonathan Ball Publishers, thank you for the vision and the opportunity for me to be able to step into this space with Musk.

To all those who kindly responded to my questions and queries and helped to paint a picture of Musk from his childhood to becoming one of the most influential figures of our time, thank you for your valuable input.

To my wife, Ursula – my first reader – if you like it, then I always know we’ve got something special. Thank you for your advice and every cup of tea that goes into every single book.

And finally, to Buzz Lightyear, for that wonderful line that echoed in my head throughout the writing of this book: ‘To infinity, and beyond.’

About the book



‘How did a bullied, introverted Pretoria schoolboy become the world’s richest person and arguably humanity’s greatest change agent? Vlismas’s extensively researched biography does a great job of unwrapping Elon Musk’s remarkable life story.’ – TOBY SHAPSHAK


Often in the news for his entrepreneurial exploits and his controversial tweets, Elon Musk is one of the richest and best-known people on earth. In 2022 he made headlines worldwide with his bid to buy Twitter. Who is this boundary-pushing billionaire with grand plans of inhabiting Mars, and what lies at the heart of his vision? Why is he so utterly unafraid of risk?

As an awkward Pretoria schoolboy who loved comics and science fiction, Musk’s early years and singular family background were crucial in forming his stellar ambitions. Journalist and author Michael Vlismas, who attended the same high school as Musk, knows well the environment that shaped him and offers new insights into Musk’s development, including his troubled relationship with his father.

Tracing his remarkable life, from his South African childhood to his move to Canada at 17 and then to the US – where Musk made millions out of PayPal and built Tesla and SpaceX into two of the world’s most famous companies – this is the story of a man driven to preserve the optimism he sees in humanity and find a future for humans ‘out there among the stars’.
