title: The Break-Ups
---




JUSTINE Wilson had just returned from ESL teaching in Japan, and was wondering what to do with her life. ‘If Elon ever calls me again, I think I’ll go for it. I might have missed something there,’1 she told her sister. A week later, she says, Musk phoned her.

Musk and Justine rekindled their relationship. They were different in so many ways, with Musk’s focus on the world of digital and Justine’s on the world of books. But in one sense they were very much alike. As was the case with Musk and his traumatic period at Bryanston High, Justine knew all about bullies.

‘The bullies found me early. In first grade, it was an oversized, older kid named Phil. In fourth and fifth grades, it was the equally oversized Ross, who introduced some confusion into the matter when he asked me to go with him. That was our version of what was once known as going steady … From sixth grade on, my bullies were girls, the kind who didn’t look or seem like bullies at all. They were bright, socially sophisticated, popular with kids and liked by grown-ups. They made my day-to-day life so miserable I eventually begged my parents to transfer me to another school. The fact that they were sweet, middle-class white girls didn’t change the fact that they were (at least to me) domineering and mean; if anything, it helped them get away with it,’2 she posted on her blog.

In a TEDx talk she gave in 2017,3 Justine told the story of a visionary friend who revealed that he hated going to school because the other kids would follow him home and ‘throw soda cans at his head’. She then told the tale of another visionary who told her that when he was a kid he was so painfully aware of how differently he thought to other kids that he was afraid he was insane. ‘He was afraid that other people would find out about him and come from him and take him away and lock him up in an asylum.’ She never mentioned Musk by name in these stories, but they are clearly similar to what Musk himself has said about his upbringing.

While he was still building Zip2, Justine flew out for several visits as they dated long-distance. She recalls one time when she took her father to meet Musk. As they walked through the office park, she says, ‘We saw these lanky dudes in jeans and T-shirts – they were racing these remote-controlled contraptions around the parking lot and banging them into cars and my dad said, “Oh, are these the children of the engineers?” And I said, “No, Dad, these are the engineers.”’4

And then, in January 2000, they married. Having denied himself a holiday for a long time, Musk decided that the two-week investment trip for PayPal later that year was the perfect opportunity to enjoy the honeymoon they hadn’t had at the time of their wedding. The trip, which included Brazil and South Africa, nearly killed him as he contracted and eventually recovered from malaria. It would reinforce his long-held belief that vacations are bad for you – in his case professionally and personally.

While she was engaged to Musk and following the sale of Zip2, Justine made a poignant remark in a television interview. Asked about her fiancé’s astounding success and his purchase of the McLaren F1 supercar, Justine responded, ‘My fear is that we become spoiled brats. That we lose a sense of appreciation and perspective.’5

Musk had also bought a small aircraft. Like his father and grandfather before him.

Perspective was important to Justine. Her perspective on her own ambitions as an author, which she says Musk at first encouraged and then later in their marriage dismissed. And perspective on their relationship as it went from a college dorm to a small office space in Palo Alto, and into the stratosphere of the new dotcom multimillionaires of Silicon Valley.

Justine referred to Musk as her own private Alexander the Great in the Marie Claire feature she wrote in 2010. There is a certain irony in this. Errol Musk had always admired the Macedonian conqueror as among the greatest figures in history. Errol’s own domineering personality also seemed to echo in the now supremely successful and wealthy Musk. At their wedding reception, Justine recalls his telling her during their dance, ‘I am the alpha in this relationship.’6 Many years later, Musk admitted in a Twitter response to a fan that his favourite class at the University of Pennsylvania had been ‘Alexander and the Rise of Hellenism’.7 The name Alexander resonated even further in their relationship. After the sale of PayPal in 2002, the Musks had their first child, a boy, whom they named Nevada Alexander.

Then the first real tragedy of Musk’s adult life hit him. In the same week that news of eBay’s purchase of PayPal was made public, Nevada died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Justine later recalled: ‘Nevada went down for a nap, placed on his back as always, and stopped breathing. He was ten weeks old, the age when male infants are most susceptible to SIDS. By the time the paramedics resuscitated him, he had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead. He spent three days on life support in a hospital in Orange County before we made the decision to take him off it. I held him in my arms when he died.’8

Nevada’s death destroyed both parents.

‘Elon made it clear that he did not want to talk about Nevada’s death,’ Justine wrote. ‘I didn’t understand this, just as he didn’t understand why I grieved openly, which he regarded as “emotionally manipulative”. I buried my feelings instead, coping with Nevada’s death by making my first visit to an IVF clinic less than two months later. Elon and I planned to get pregnant again as swiftly as possible. Within the next five years, I gave birth to twins [Xavier and Griffin], then triplets [Kai, Saxon and Damian], and I sold three novels to Penguin and Simon & Schuster. Even so, Nevada’s death sent me on a years-long inward spiral of depression and distraction.’9

In the year after Nevada’s death, Justine and Musk attended the Burning Man festival in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert. It was the place where their son had been conceived, and after which they had named him. There she wrote his name on a makeshift shrine. But while Justine tapped into her writer’s soul to try to deal with the death of her son, Musk was more pragmatic and simply decided to bury his feelings, in the belief that dwelling on something was not helpful at all.

And Musk clearly felt he had to move on, because he existed in a fast-paced world that was moving faster by the second. Justine recalls how their marriage was one of parties with the rich and famous, from Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio to Bono, Richard Branson, Larry Page, John Cusack and other celebrities and business icons. Justine even recalls going to a local Starbucks with actress Daryl Hannah.10

It seemed inevitable that something had to give, and in the end it was their marriage. She later wrote: ‘Elon was obsessed with his work: when he was home, his mind was elsewhere. I longed for deep and heartfelt conversations, for intimacy and empathy. And while I sacrificed a normal family life for his career, Elon started to say that I “read too much”, shrugging off my book deadlines. This felt like a dismissal, and a stark reversal from the days when he was so supportive. When we argued – over the house or the kids’ sleeping schedule – my faults and flaws came under the microscope. I felt insignificant in his eyes, and I began thinking about what effect our dynamic would have on our five young sons.’11

Eventually, it was a near-fatal car accident in Los Angeles in the spring of 2008 that convinced her the marriage was over. Justine recalls her first thoughts immediately after the accident as being more focused on what her husband’s reaction would be rather than the fact that she had survived: ‘In my mind’s eye, I could suddenly see myself: a woman who’d gotten very thin, and very blonde, stumbling out of a very expensive car with the front-left wheel smashed in. I barely recognized myself. I had turned into a trophy wife – and I sucked at it.’12

Musk’s emotional response to Justine at this time is strikingly reminiscent of his own father’s attitude towards Maye.

The couple tried counselling, which failed. They were divorced in 2008. It was a very messy, very public divorce. In a blog post shortly after her divorce, Justine wrote: ‘No one who knows my ex-husband would accuse him of being weak-willed. The same qualities that helped bring about his extraordinary success dictate that the life you lead with him is his life, you have to want the same things he wants, and that there is no middle ground (not least because he has no time to find it).’13

And in another blog post, she reflected on her marriage to Musk: ‘The happiest moments of my marriage took place in the earlier years, on the Saturday and Sunday mornings when E and I went to the bookstore, then took our purchases to a café and read over coffee and just hung out. Somewhere along the line we stopped doing that. Hindsight tells me that our marriage suffered for it. But the ironic thing is, for all the glamour and adventure of the jet-set lifestyle, when I think about happiness with him I don’t remember the south of France or St Barts or the Google dude’s wedding on Richard Branson’s private island (in fact, we had wicked fights and I sounded some true depths of misery at all those places). I think about lazily strolling down University Avenue in Palo Alto, our arms around each other’s waists, in the sunlight.’14

Describing herself as Musk’s ‘starter wife’, Justine received a text message from her ex-husband six weeks after he filed for divorce, informing her that he was dating the English actress Talulah Riley. Justine described Riley as ‘better fitted to my ex-husband’s lifestyle and personality than I ever was’.15 According to Justine, Riley also seemed to have no problem with changing her hair colour from brunette to blonde, something she says was a strange sticking point in her relationship with Musk, who insisted that she colour her hair blonde.

Musk and Riley met at a club – the exclusive Whisky Mist – in London while he was on a business trip. According to him, she expressed a shared interest in physics. Musk was immediately taken by her, and they began dating.

He proposed only ten days after their first date. ‘Elon proposed really quickly. The idea of being swept off your feet is really appealing,’ Riley said.16 But her marriage to Musk in 2010 coincided with some of his most chaotic, darkest and desperate years in business as he tried to keep Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity alive while burning through his cash reserves at a furious rate. ‘I don’t know how he handles the stress. If I was him I would’ve died of a heart attack. You would not wish that kind of pain on your worst enemy,’ Riley said at the time.17

Clearly, the strain took its toll on their marriage and they divorced in 2012. They married again in 2013, and divorced again in 2016. ‘I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy one day,’ Musk tweeted.18 He told Forbes magazine, ‘We took some time apart for several months to see if absence makes the heart grow fonder, and unfortunately it did not. I still love her, but I’m not in love with her. And I can’t really give her what she wants.’19

Musk has spoken repeatedly of his desire for a stable relationship. In 2016, he began dating another actress, Amber Heard, who was still married to actor Johnny Depp. At the time, Heard and Depp were estranged because of their turbulent and allegedly violent relationship, and Heard had obtained a restraining order against Depp. Later, during a libel action brought by Depp against The Sun newspaper, a London court even heard text messages Musk had sent Heard offering to pay for her full-time security. According to Musk, he and Heard only started dating a month after she had filed for divorce from Depp. ‘I don’t think I was ever even in the vicinity of Amber during their marriage,’20 he said.

Their relationship didn’t develop, and in his seminal 2017 interview with Rolling Stone Musk admitted he was heartbroken when Heard ended it: ‘I was really in love, and it hurt bad … It’s so hard for me to even meet people. I’m looking for a long-term relationship. I’m not looking for a one-night stand. I’m looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing.’21

And then in 2018, Musk was on Twitter and about to tweet a niche science joke about Roko’s Basilisk – a thought experiment about AI taking over the world – and rococo, the ornate 18th-century design style. Musk had wanted to somehow combine the two and make a joke with their connection, only to discover that somebody had already done that and created a character called Roccoco Basilisk.

It was Claire Elise Boucher, a Canadian musician known as Grimes (the spelling Roccoco was hers). She had referenced it in the credits of her 2015 music video, ‘Flesh Without Blood’, listing Roccoco Basilisk as one of the characters she played in the video. The joke existed on Twitter for three years before somebody finally got it, namely, Elon Musk. After ‘flirting’ on Twitter – and with occasional moments of unfollowing each other that were quickly picked up on by Twitter followers – Musk and Grimes made their relationship public when they attended the 2018 Met Gala in New York. Musk described her as one of the most unusual people he had ever met.

In May 2020, the unmarried couple gave birth to a baby boy and announced his name to the world as X Æ A-12. Their choice of name was as unusual as their shared love for obscure AI jokes and references.

Grimes revealed via Twitter what the name represented:

X = the unknown variable.

Æ = my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial Intelligence)

A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favourite aircraft). No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent

+

(A=Archangel, my favorite song)


A California regulation prohibiting the use of numbers in personal names saw the couple later change the 12 to Xii. According to Musk, the name is pronounced ‘X Ash A Twelve’. Musk has said he admires Grimes’s work ethic, while she clearly admires his space aspirations and has declared herself ready to die with the red dust of Mars beneath her feet.

But once again, Musk’s search for true love appeared as challenging as finding life on other planets. In September 2020, Musk announced on Twitter that he and Grimes had split, the result, he said, of their demanding work schedules. Nevertheless, in an interview with Vanity Fair on 10 March 2022, Musk and Grimes announced the birth of a daughter, named Y, conceived via a surrogate.



OF all the women in his life, Justine appears to have understood Musk the best. Or rather to have had the greatest understanding of the character and mind of Musk. She understood his childhood insecurities arising from being so different. And she had a keen understanding of how this translated into the visionary he would become.

In a manner that paraphrases Peter Thiel’s summation of how society gives people like Elon Musk the freedom to move outside traditional constraints, Justine observed: ‘Artists and entrepreneurs are a lot alike. They are both obsessed with creating something out of nothing. With pulling value from the dark. Before we call people visionaries, before they have that kind of success, we have other words for them. We call them geek or outsider, socially awkward, weird, a little different, the odd one out.

‘In the beginning we don’t trust them because we think they’re crazy, but in the end we trust them because we know they’re crazy. Crazy enough to accomplish anything and risk it all in order to bring us something new to believe in. They might make lousy husbands and terrible wives, but they bring light to the dark and they show us the universe.’22

In a 2016 talk she did for TEDx San Francisco, titled ‘Wounded People Tell Better Stories’, Justine made the following observation about her former husband and the similarly brilliant and successful people in his circles: ‘Even the most golden among us, I mean they have stellar careers, but if you look at the other areas of their lives you’ll see where their demons manifest themselves. Their forms of self-sabotage, their wounds … we can’t choose our passion any more than we can choose our wounds … We create a parallel world to escape the world that rejects us or which we find too painful to live in. But some people are so good at doing this and master such an amazing skill set that they take their world and they infuse it into our world, and they change the world. And these are the people we call visionaries. People who move between worlds.’23

Justine has been a keen observer of Musk’s ability to transcend these two worlds, and offers an insight into why it makes him so successful: ‘When Elon and I would travel and we had to fill out those forms at customs that want to know your occupation, Elon never wrote down CEO or King of the World, or Studly International Playboy. He wrote engineer. And he wore jeans and T-shirts to work. And whenever we went shopping for clothes, or later consulted with a stylist whose name was Martin, he would say, “No, no, you don’t understand. I can’t look cool or hip because I have to look like an engineer.”

‘One of the things he told me was that engineers could not quite figure out why it was that the suits made the big money when it was the engineers who actually built the stuff that they were selling. Meanwhile the suits would listen to the engineers talk and they would have no idea what they were saying. That’s when I realised that Elon was somebody who had learned to speak both languages. He could move between the tribes because he was an engineer in a suit. And he brought together worlds. This is what a visionary does.’24

Musk once said that although many people thought of him as a businessman, his companies were actually vehicles for him to explore the engineering he was most passionate about – that he didn’t want to have a suit telling him what he could and couldn’t do.

But one of Justine’s most astute observations has come through one of their sons. According to Justine, he was diagnosed with autism when he was four years old. He apparently also has a photographic memory. After explaining to her son how his photographic memory works, she says he looked at her and said: ‘You mean other people don’t think like that?’25

It was a comment that recalled something Musk once said about himself: ‘There are things that seem quite clear and obvious to me, and I don’t understand why they aren’t so obvious to everyone’.26 It harks back to that six-year-old boy in Pretoria who thought he was ‘strange’ because of all the ideas in his head.

Apart from Maye and Errol, Justine was possibly the first person not just to recognise Musk’s different nature but also to understand it – a man who existed in different worlds, and who ‘brought together worlds’ through his visionary ideas and innovation.

And back in 2002, her then husband was about to embark on the boldest of these journeys between worlds as his vision started to extend towards the stars.
