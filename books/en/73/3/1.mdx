FOR Elon Musk, the face of Benjamin Franklin on the US $100 bill is more significant than at first appears.

When it came to starting his first company, Zip2, Musk did what he has always done since he was a child and wanted to learn about something. He went to books. Specifically, he read biographies and autobiographies. And the one that captured his attention was Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson. Franklin is a source of great inspiration for Musk: ‘He was basically just a runaway kid and created his printing business. He also did science and politics. He’s one of the people I most admire. Franklin is pretty awesome.’1

Scientist, inventor, politician, philanthropist and businessman, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He helped to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776, represented the new nation at the court of King Louis XVI and helped produce the US Constitution. But there is another reason why Franklin’s face adorns the $100 bill: he was at one point the richest man in America. Forbes has estimated that his net worth in today’s terms would make him a billionaire. Quite clearly, Franklin was a highly successful businessman and entrepreneur.

Franklin’s book The Way to Wealth (1758) includes many of his most famous sayings, such as ‘A penny saved is a penny earned’ and ‘Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise’. Franklin’s career clearly resonated with Musk, as an example of someone who married science and invention with business savvy. It was not just good enough to have a great idea; it was important to have an idea that could create value.

In 2009, when he was asked by Charlie Rose what his core skill was, Musk replied, ‘If something has to be designed and invented and you have to figure out how to ensure that the value of the thing you create is greater than the cost of the inputs, then that’s probably my core skill.’2

Musk’s desire to create things of value is very similar to Franklin’s own philosophy of ‘doing well by doing good’.3 Musk describes his take on this as ‘I try to do useful things. That’s a nice aspiration. And useful means it is of value to the rest of society. Are they useful things that work and make people’s lives better, make the future seem better, and actually are better, too? I think we should try to make the future better.’4 But Musk’s belief in a ‘purpose-driven company’ does not just have a utopian outcome. For him, such a company has the benefit of naturally attracting the best talent in the world.

In a series of conversations with Steve Jurvetson, an American businessman and venture capitalist, at Stanford in 2015 as part of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, Musk said: ‘If there’s something that’s intrinsically enjoyable, and the financial rewards are good, but also it’s something that’s going to genuinely change the world, then that’s a pretty powerful motivator. But I don’t think everything needs to change the world. There’s lot of useful things that people do. I think it should be a usefulness optimisation. It’s saying, “Is what I’m doing as useful as it could be?” Even if something isn’t changing the world, if it’s making people’s lives better I think that’s great. If it’s affecting a lot of people, even in a small way, then this is good.’5

Musk says it was this desire that made him decide to abandon his plans to study at Stanford. ‘I wasn’t sure that what I would work on in the PhD would actually be useful. It could be academically useful but not practically useful,’ he said. ‘And I felt that if I watched the Internet get built while I’m doing this, that would be really frustrating.’6

It was from the biography of Franklin and a range of other books that Musk taught himself the business skills he felt he needed. But he is by no means just a theorist on business. He knows what it means to work hard to make a company successful and often gets involved himself, sometimes to the company’s success and sometimes to its detriment. ‘A friend once said to me, “Starting a company is like eating glass while staring into the abyss.”’7

Another core tenet of Musk’s business philosophy is to talk less and do more.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April 2021 he said: ‘I think there might be too many MBAs running companies. There’s the MBA-ization of America, which I think is not that great. There should be more focus on the product or the service itself. Less time on board meetings. Less time on financials. What’s the point of a company at all? Why even have companies? A company is an assembly of people gathered together to create a product or service and to deliver that product or service. Sometimes people lose sight of that. A company has no value in and of itself. It only has value to the degree that it is an effective allocator of resources to create goods and services that are of greater value than the cost of the inputs. This thing we call profits should just mean over time that the value of the output is worth more than the inputs.’8

Musk’s general thoughts about business and what companies represent have made him one of the most uncharacteristic CEOs of his generation. But this in turn has also made him quite difficult to contain according to the traditional constraints and bureaucracy of the business world, and the legalities involved. He is a man not entirely at ease in the boardroom and with directors to report to. The red tape of company governance, and indeed the generally established and accepted corporate and financial regulations, remain a burden for someone who wants to move fast and get on with things. As a result, Musk will always butt heads with the system. His most recent issues with tax legislation in the US and ongoing issues with investors are examples of a theme that will continue to play itself out in his career.



AFTER gaining as much knowledge as he could from his studies and books, it was time for Musk to put all of this into practice with his first company. And he chose the fledgling Internet as his launch pad. ‘The Internet – that was the moment to really do something,’ he recalled.9

While it was obvious to Musk that the Internet was going to have an enormous impact and would redefine humanity, what wasn’t so obvious was how to make money out of it. ‘Back in 1995 there weren’t many people on the Internet, and certainly nobody was making any money at all. Most people thought the Internet was going to be a fad,’ he said in an interview in 1999.10

But his desire was not to make money off the Internet for money’s sake, so much as it was a desire to be a part of the Internet.

The Internet was the first step in his carefully thought-out plan of what he wanted to achieve. ‘When I was in college, there were three areas that I thought would most affect the future of humanity. Those were the Internet, the transition to a sustainable energy and transportation sector, and the third was space exploration, in particular the extension of life to multiple planets,’ he said.11

In Musk’s mind, the Internet would turn humanity into ‘a super organism’. And knowing where to buy your nearest pizza and how to navigate your way there seemed like a great addition to this super organism.

Netscape had just gone public, proving that there was indeed a way to make money off the Internet. And Musk believed it wasn’t the only way. So in the summer of 1995, Musk started working on the Global Link Information Network, later to become Zip2. After purchasing a local business directory, Musk acquired access to the digital mapping software of a GPS company named Navteq. He now had two large databases, and his job was a simple one by today’s standards but revolutionary back then: make them talk to each other. That’s where his coding skills came to the fore. He, Kimbal (who sold his share in a painting company to join his brother in business) and Kouri launched the company with whatever money they could put together, including between $20 000 and $30 000 allegedly provided by Errol.

Musk poured himself into the work. With only one computer, he coded at night so that the computer could run the business by day. And they lived on the bare minimum. Musk loves to say he didn’t only have no money, he had ‘negative money. I had huge student debts.’12

‘When you are first starting out, you really need to make your burn rate ridiculously tiny,’ he said in an address to the Wharton School.13 Or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, ‘Rather go to bed without dinner than to rise in debt.’14 Speaking on the Knowledge@Wharton podcast, Musk expanded on this principle: ‘One lesson is, spend very little money. That was a case where I had very little money, so there really wasn’t any choice. I only had a few thousand dollars. And then my brother came down and he had several thousand dollars. We just rented an office for $400 or $500 a month – some really tiny little office in Palo Alto. It was cheaper than an apartment. And then we bought futons that converted into a couch, which was sort of like a meeting area during the day. We would sleep there at night and shower at the YMCA, which was just a few blocks away. That was an extremely low burn rate. It was way cheaper than a garage. Garages are expensive. So we were able to putter along for several months until we got venture funding. I think that’s a good lesson. Don’t spend more than you are sure you have.’15

But the frugality of life for him at this point was nothing compared with the pure joy of having found his purpose. For the first time in his life, Musk felt at home. The exploding ideas in his head had found a home amid the ideas exploding around him in Silicon Valley. The strange kid who worried that he was different was now a kindred spirit in a technological neighbourhood of the strangest ‘kids’ on the planet, all living out the exploding ideas in their own heads. And the boy who never quite fitted in at school knew exactly who he was when he slid behind a computer screen and started tapping out code on the keyboard.

And he underpinned everything he did with his main philosophy – being useful. ‘Doing something useful for other people – that I like doing,’ he told Joe Rogan.16 ‘My goal is to try to make useful things, try to maximise the probability that the future is good, make the future exciting, something to look forward to.’17

It seems a very simple philosophy for a genius, but it’s one that Musk believes in an altruistic manner. Musk shows an intense love for all that humanity represents. And it shows in his work. Whether it’s creating the best user experience to find your nearest pizza place, building a user-friendly payment system, creating electric cars that are actually beautiful or building rockets that will ultimately help humanity find another home and preserve the consciousness he believes is so precious and rare, Musk has always been driven to be useful to his fellow man: ‘I’m pro-human. I love humanity.’18

He has expressed his greatest fear as, ‘the extinction of human civilisation’.19 And, in his best version of himself, he drives this with ideas rather than ego, although ego naturally gets in the way at times. But, for the most part, Musk is exactly as his friend Danny Warnick described him: ‘You knew exactly where you stood with him.’

Musk himself has said, ‘If everyone’s trying to trick everyone all the time, it’s a lot of noise and confusion. It’s better just to be straightforward and try to do useful things. You don’t have to read between the lines with me. I’m saying the lines!’20

And Zip2 was the first real expression of this philosophy.

In the Stanford conversations, he describes the one quality every successful entrepreneur needs: ‘An obsessive nature with respect to the quality of the product. So being an obsessive-compulsive is a good thing in this context.’21

But once again, it’s the overriding human element that Musk expresses in his work and philosophy of what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur: ‘Really liking what you do. Even if you’re the best of the best, there’s always the chance of failure. So it’s important that you really like whatever you’re doing. If you don’t like it, life is too short. And if you like what you’re doing, you think about it even when you’re not working. It’s something that your mind is drawn to. If you don’t like it, you really just can’t make it work, I don’t think.’22

Armed with one computer, Musk drilled a hole in the floor of his office/apartment, connected a null modem cable to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) located directly beneath them, and connected to the Internet for $100 a month. A Benjamin Franklin.

With a small team of salespeople, they began the process of trying to convince local businesses that Zip2 was the new Yellow Pages. Why have an expensive-to-produce telephone directory that gives you only local access when you can put yourself on the Internet for a fraction of the cost and have a global presence? With a dogged focus on spending almost nothing, even the little bit of money that trickled in was a positive for the company. As Musk says, ‘When we went and talked to VCs (venture capitalists) we could actually say we had positive cash flow.’23

And the first to come around to what Musk and Zip2 were doing was the venture capital firm of Mohr Davidow Ventures. The firm invested around $3 million in Global Link Information Network, and changed the name to Zip2. In today’s terms, we would describe it as an Internet 1.0 company. A pioneer.

Mohr Davidow Ventures took majority control of the company, and they brought in Richard Sorkin to replace Musk as CEO. Sorkin was a former NASA intern who had made commercialisation of new technology his speciality. He was older and more experienced, and the investors saw him as better suited than Musk – who remained as chief technology officer – to scaling the new business.

Under Sorkin, Zip2 no longer just targeted local businesses. He saw an opportunity to become the new classifieds for the newspaper industry. The New York Times was the first to take up this opportunity, followed by the Chicago Tribune, Knight Ridder group and the Hearst Corporation.

But the growth of Zip2 brought with it a fundamental problem for founding entrepreneurs – loss of control. Although Sorkin’s business strategy was successful – Zip2 grew to partnerships with media companies in 60 of the 100 top metropolitan areas – Musk was not in total agreement with the way the business was headed. Sorkin wanted Zip2 to be the power behind these media companies, while Musk reportedly wanted to see Zip2 (and perhaps himself) more in the spotlight.

‘There were disagreements over the priority of general visibility for the company,’ Sorkin said in a 1999 interview with online magazine Salon.24 The interviewer, Mark Gimein, asked Sorkin ‘if it was true that Musk, in the words of another associate, wanted to see his picture on the cover of Rolling Stone? “Yes,” he said. “For Elon that’s what general visibility meant.”’25

The relationship between Sorkin and Musk broke down as their inability to work together grew.

And at the heart of his product, a team of new engineers had been brought in to re-code what was seen as Musk’s very much DIY approach to coding, which he had obviously taught himself and which, while effective, was in need of a serious upgrade as the company sought to move to the next level.

Musk became increasingly frustrated, to the point that after the engineers had re-coded the software in the day, he would reportedly jump in at night and secretly undo all of their work with his own coding again. It led to a period in which Musk was criticised for his micro-management and did not endear himself to his employees, who found him harder and harder to work with.

When Sorkin sought to merge Zip2 with a similar company, CitySearch, it was the final straw for Musk. With the board’s approval, he had Sorkin removed as CEO and the much-talked-about merger failed. Musk later admitted his mistakes and said he had been naive. It set a troubling precedent for Musk, one often cited by his critics. After removing Sorkin as CEO of Zip2, Musk himself was later removed by his management team when he was CEO of PayPal. And even later in his career as CEO of Tesla in 2009, Musk had a very public legal battle with Martin Eberhard, the founder of Tesla Motors, who accused Musk of orchestrating his removal from the company and trying to take sole credit for the Roadster electric car they had created together.

Musk was still clearly trying to refine what he would later talk about in the Stanford conversations as a ‘purpose-driven company’. The ego clashes and boardroom battles at Zip2 in the late 1990s certainly contrast with his later view of his first company: ‘We had a philosophy of best idea wins as opposed to the person proposing the idea winning because they are who they are. Everyone was an equity stakeholder. If there were two paths to take and one wasn’t obviously better than the other; rather than spending time trying to figure out which one was better we would just pick one and do it. Often it’s just better to pick a path and do it than to just vacillate on a choice.’26

Derek Proudian was brought in to replace Sorkin as CEO. On the streets of Silicon Valley, Zip2 was seen as a company in trouble. Proudian had worked with the creators of ARPANET before joining Mohr Davidow Ventures in the early 1990s. But Proudian was a venture capitalist, not a CEO. He was there to invest in companies, not to run them.

Proudian describes his extensive experience in investing in start-ups as ‘making a bet on people’,27 and he was clearly happy to accept the CEO role based on the risks involved, and what he says is an answer to what he looks for in a start-up: ‘Can they convince me that market opportunity is big enough that you can build a sizable company in that area?’28 Zip2 convinced Proudian. And Proudian in turn convinced the Compaq Computer Corporation.

In 1999, Compaq announced that it was purchasing Zip2 for roughly $300 million. According to The New York Times, the acquisition was Compaq’s ‘effort to make its Internet search engine, AltaVista, more competitive with rivals like Yahoo, Lycos and Excite’.29 Musk was 27 years old when he received a reported $22 million for his seven per cent share in Zip2. ‘That was certainly a better outcome than I had ever expected,’ he said.30

Some who have criticised Musk’s corporate aptitude see Zip2 as the start of this pattern in his career. In his 1999 Salon interview, Mark Gimein noted: ‘On the corporate report card, Musk’s grade for “Plays well with others” would have been a solid F.’31 And others were, and still are, critical of Musk’s strategy of teaching himself whatever he doesn’t know and learning as he goes along – whether it be Internet coding or how to build rockets.

But Musk has never put himself forward as anything else and is completely open about this side of his personality. Going back to his belief in the scientific method, Musk has described his process as follows:

1. Ask a question.

2. Gather as much evidence as possible about it.

3. Develop axioms based on the evidence, and try to assign a probability of truth to each one.

4. Draw a conclusion based on cogency in order to determine: are these axioms correct, are they relevant, do they necessarily lead to this conclusion, and with what probability?

5. Attempt to disprove the conclusion. Seek refutation from others to further help break your conclusion.

6. If nobody can invalidate your conclusion, then you’re probably right, but you’re not certainly right.


He described these points as ‘really helpful for figuring out the tricky things’.32

As rogue as he may seem to some, in those heady early days in Silicon Valley, he was exactly what was needed. He was a maverick. He was a risk-taker. He was a creative genius. As Gimein wrote in 1999, ‘Musk’s ego has gotten him in trouble before, and it may get him in trouble again, yet it is also part and parcel of what it means to be a hotshot entrepreneur.’33

But ‘doesn’t play by the rules’ only works for as long as there are no rules. When you become a $300-million company owned by a corporate colossus, there are suddenly plenty of rules. And that leaves no space for the maverick.

After the sale of Zip2, Musk knew it was time to move on.

He had embraced the digital revolution of the Internet, and where Zip2 started out as everything he ever dreamt of from his childhood in Pretoria, it ended up being only a taster of what was possible in this new information age. For Musk, this was akin to the moment when the young Leonardo da Vinci first stepped into the studio of his teacher, Verrocchio, and began to discover the world through art. Musk was at the vanguard of what would become known as the ‘serial entrepreneurs’ of Silicon Valley. But Silicon Valley was having a hard time coming to grips with who – or what – Elon Musk actually was. He wasn’t an out-and-out developer, even though he could clearly code well enough. Neither was he just a businessman, although he had a track record better than most, having sold his first company for $300 million. He couldn’t have been accused of just being in the right place at the right time either. For every successful start-up that made multimillionaires of their founders, hundreds of others never left their parents’ garages.

As Gimein observed in 1999 following the sale of Zip2, ‘There is no very obvious reason why Musk is the person to pull this off.’34 A man with a keen interest in computers and science fiction and no media or marketing experience builds an online searchable database for the biggest media companies in the US. And for his next act, a man with only a brief education in economics, and an even more brief internship at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Canada in the early 1990s, sets his sights on transforming the banking sector. ‘Actually, I’ve found that being an outsider helps you to think creatively about improving the way things are done. When people have been doing things the same way for years, they stop questioning their methods even if they defy common sense,’ he told Gimein.35

If anything, Musk is a typical leader able to convince his followers that the adventure he is embarking on with them will be worth their while, will mean something and will contribute to something far bigger than themselves.

Musk has continually spoken of doing ‘useful things’. He is not driven by money but by the desire to make a greater impact on humanity. Yes, this in turn drives his ego. Among the things he did with his earnings from the sale of Zip2 was to buy a McLaren F1 supercar. Apparently, he beat by a signature Ralph Lauren’s attempt to purchase the same car. But he couldn’t have looked more awkward and out of place with this vehicle. Later attempts to portray Musk as the inspiration behind the Tony Stark and Iron Man character in The Avengers only really stretch to the creative genius and rogue nature of both. The fictional Stark’s playboy lifestyle and social chemistry do not line up with Musk at all.

In his biography of Leonardo da Vinci, Robert Payne gives a glimpse into what drives the minds of men like Musk when he describes Leonardo’s own desire to ‘discover the world, to force it to reveal its secrets and divest it of its mysteries; and like Columbus, who set out for the Indies in the belief that he was fulfilling the prophecies of Isaiah, they believed they were fulfilling a divine purpose’.36

Decades later, Musk would define his quest to go to Mars as far more than just space exploration. To him it is the final great attempt to preserve human consciousness against the threat of a catastrophic extinction of human civilisation. It is the conundrum of Musk and explains the inability to categorise him, as well as the inability of many people to grasp exactly what he is all about. On one hand, he wraps his mind around impossible calculations and is generally accepted as a genius. But, on the other, he speaks with an almost childlike naivety about saving the world and making things people will love. Speaking in his later role at Tesla, when General Motors (GM) abandoned its own electric car project – the EV1, produced from 1996 to 1999 – Musk did not lament a missed opportunity or a failed business venture so much as bemoan GM’s inability to see the obvious. When GM forcibly repossessed the EV1 cars from their leaseholders and sent them to be crushed, Musk was struck by the fact that the leaseholders held a candlelit vigil at the crushing plant. ‘When was the last time there was a candlelit vigil for a product?’ Musk asked.37 Their love for these vehicles touched him deeply, and also made him ask the obvious question: ‘If people are willing to hold a candlelit vigil for the EV1, maybe it means you should have made an EV2?’

Sometimes, Musk looks at very obvious problems with a very obvious solution. He just gets it done when nobody else knows where to start, be it building a rocket powerful enough to go to Mars or deciding to dig tunnels under Los Angeles for a new traffic system. And he begins by just digging a hole in the SpaceX parking lot. Where others are weighed down by the planning phase, Musk just starts digging a hole and figures it out from there.

In his Salon article, Gimein astutely assessed the young Musk when he wrote, ‘There is so much money to be made off the Internet, and most of the experts don’t know where to start. None of the traditional talents seem to correlate with success. The only one that seems to really matter is the peculiar ability to get started. Everybody in Silicon Valley is looking for the lucky guy who can lead them to the big score. There is a talent that Musk has, but nobody can put his finger on it … Maybe Musk really has a special spark that lets him think more strategically than everybody around him. Maybe Musk really is the next big thing. Or maybe he has just managed to make his backers believe that he is the Brand X, the next superstar. In today’s Silicon Valley, the difference between being the next big thing and looking like it may not even matter.’38

In the mind of Musk, the next big thing was online banking: ‘I felt there was still more that could be done with the Internet.’39 The idea was very similar to Zip2, except with financial services.

Silicon Valley’s ‘Brand X’ had a new vision.

And, appropriately, he called it X.com.
