AS with most of Musk’s ideas, the genesis of X.com was to take something complex and make it easier for more people to use. ‘Let’s make a really convenient site that combines all of people’s financial needs into one seamless, easy-to-use location,’1 is how he described it.

After the sale of Zip2, Musk admits that he took no time off and moved immediately into identifying ‘where are the opportunities in the Internet’.2 For him, this was the financial services sector, which he believed lacked innovation. He later said something very similar about the space industry: ‘The reason there hasn’t been a big improvement in the space industry is because there’s such a big amount of capital that’s needed to start a rocket company, and the number of people that understand rocketry in the world is very small. So there are huge barriers to entry. That’s why we haven’t really seen the improvement that there should have been over the years.’

So in March 1999, one month after selling Zip2, Musk started X.com with $10 million of the $22 million he had received from the sale of Zip2. In a local TV interview at the time, a young Musk says, ‘I could go and buy one of the islands in the Bahamas and turn it into my personal fiefdom. But I’m much more interested in trying to build and create a new company.’3

As Musk says in the interview, in his mind this was a series of poker games. And he was now moving to a more high-stakes version of poker. He then stands in front of an ATM and says, ‘This is a traditional ATM. We’re going to transform banking I think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.’4

For Musk, the key lay in the fact that ‘money is low bandwidth. You don’t need some sort of big infrastructure improvement to do things with it. It’s really just an entry into a database. The paper form of money is really only a small percentage of all the money that’s out there.’5

According to Musk, combining a person’s total financial services needs into one website was the complex part of the job. Strangely, the ability to send money over the Internet proved a far simpler problem to solve. Musk says it took them a day to create this revolutionary new service. And the key marketing tool here was that if somebody wanted to transfer money to another person who didn’t have an X.com account, it sent them an email asking the other person if they wanted to sign up, which they clearly wanted to do. With that came the exponential growth of the service.

It surprised even Musk that the reaction to email payments and the electronic transfer of funds was far greater than it was to being able to consolidate all of your financial services on one platform.

But this was no surprise to another start-up by the name of Confinity and its founder, Peter Thiel. Confinity, also based in Palo Alto, was on the same track as X.com, although its approach was slightly different. They were using a device called the PalmPilot (a handheld mobile device) to transfer tokens from one PalmPilot to another, and they then created a website where you could redeem and reconcile these token payments. The website was called PayPal.

But Confinity came to the same surprising conclusion as Musk and X.com, namely, that people were far more interested in the electronic transfer of funds than in any of the other elements. It has been referred to as a happy accident, and one that saw the two companies merge in March 2000. The drive behind the merger was survival in the emerging digital world that was now moving at the click of a button, and with ecommerce developing equally fast.

About five years earlier, eBay had been founded as the first online auction website. By 2000 it already had 12 million users. According to David O Sacks, the South African-born former COO of PayPal, ‘Confinity/PayPal and X.com were locked in a heated competition to gain share on eBay. Confinity initially offered a $10 signup bonus and a $10 referral bonus for each new user (the referral bonus went to the inviter). X.com then upped their bonuses to $20. Both companies probably would have run out of money competing with each other.’6

So the merger made sense in terms of combining market share. Initially, the new company was called X.com. But consumers felt the name was somewhat vague, and some were even concerned that it might be perceived as pornographic. And so it was that they settled on PayPal instead.

Musk was made the CEO of PayPal. But less than two years later, he was effectively ousted from the company he had helped to create. Once again, the disruptor-turned-founder had trouble with the transition from start-up to the day-to-day running of a company.

When Musk returned from a business trip to raise investment, he was greeted with the news that he was out. Musk describes one of the lessons he learned from that experience: ‘It’s not a good idea to leave the office when there are a lot of major things underway which are causing people a great deal of stress … That caused the management team to decide I wasn’t the right guy to run the company. I could’ve fought it really hard, but I decided that rather than fight it at this critical time it’s best to just concede … Peter and Max [Levchin] and David [O Sacks] and the other guys, they’re smart people with generally the right motivations. They did what they thought was right and I think for the right reasons. Except that the reasons weren’t valid in my opinion.’7

The reasons, it seems, were decidedly simple. Musk was not in favour of the Linux software used to run PayPal, and instead preferred Microsoft software. This led to a rift in the management of the company, and there were even accusations that Microsoft was counterproductive and caused software operating issues.

So when Musk left the office for his investment drive, it provided the perfect opportunity to oust him and replace him with Thiel. According to Julie Anderson, the former vice president of public relations at PayPal, ‘After the merger everyone tried to play nicely together at first, but – as has been widely chronicled from various perspectives – it took just a few months before the differences in opinion turned ugly. Elon took a vacation that year and I’ve always hated that I didn’t realize they were going to oust him as CEO in time; he called that day from somewhere in Africa and asked “How bad is it?” and I said “Not that bad. I think it’s going to be okay.” Middle of the night I sat straight up in bed and headed back to the office; the lights were blazing and everyone was there. It was done by morning.’8

Thiel emerged as Musk’s early competitor, then partner, then replacement, and even later an investor in both Tesla and SpaceX. Musk has said he harbours no ill feelings towards Thiel. And Thiel has praised Musk in the most unlikely of ways. In describing Musk as one of a kind, he’s used a counterargument to claim that Musk is a ‘negative role model’ for kids because he is so hard to follow: ‘If you tell a young person, “Why don’t you be like Elon?” it’s a negative role model where the basic response is, “Well that’s too hard, I can’t do that.”’9

Thiel was certainly qualified to spot the genius in Musk, being one himself. By the age of 12, he was a nationally ranked chess grand master. He went through Stanford University, like so many of Silicon Valley’s brightest minds, where he cofounded the university’s newspaper, The Stanford Review. With a degree in philosophy, Thiel shares much of Musk’s desire to look at technology and innovation from the standpoint of how useful it can be to humanity.

He saw in Musk, and clearly in himself, the seeds of the great questions around innovation. In a 2015 talk at Columbia University’s Center on Capitalism and Society, Thiel referred to this as the internal perspective on innovation: ‘There is a sense in which every moment in the history of science and technology happens only once. The next Mark Zuckerberg will not be starting a social networking site. The next Larry Page will not be starting a search engine. The next Bill Gates will not be starting an operating system. If you are blindly copying these people, you’re not learning from them at all … What if the key thing in innovation is always if not the miraculous at least the singular. The one-time and only one-time aspect that drives these kinds of things.’10

In Thiel, Musk most likely met someone so similar to himself that it proved a difficult working relationship at PayPal. In encouraging innovative thought, Thiel talks about challenging truths: ‘What truths do people believe that nobody agrees with you on.’11 Musk comes at it from his own perspective: ‘I care a lot about the truth of things, and trying to understand the truth of things.’ He expands on this: ‘Reason by first principles rather than analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is reason by analogy because it’s mentally easier. But first principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You boil things down to fundamental truths and say, “What are we sure is true?” and then reason up from there.’12

For Thiel, though, these matters of innovation and truth come with no hard and fast rules, especially in Silicon Valley, where he says it boils down to ‘the inner reality being one of an always unique constellation of people and potentiality’.13 For Musk, realising potentiality was the easy part. But, ironically enough, the man who would later build rockets to go into space found navigating constellations, particularly Thiel’s ‘unique constellation of people’, far more challenging.

‘There are many challenges with having the founders of these companies continue to manage them as CEOs,’ says Thiel. ‘There are all sorts of things they do not understand that well. They’re often young and immature and there are a lot of things that go wrong. But the one big difference is they actually do believe in the thing they’re working on.’14 He relates an early example from Facebook, where he was the first outside investor. After two years of operation, they were presented with a billion-dollar acquisition offer from Yahoo. At the board meeting to discuss the offer, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was obvious they should turn it down. What the rest of the board believed was going to be a ten-minute discussion turned into six hours, and they turned the offer down. As Thiel recalls, ‘Mark said he didn’t know what he would do with a quarter of a billion dollars. He would probably just start another social networking site, and as he quite liked the one he had, he didn’t see why he should sell it.’15

As Thiel points out with the Facebook example, a diehard CEO would have done a lot of things better, but the one thing he would’ve done wrong was to sell Facebook to Yahoo for a billion dollars.

Similarly, Musk’s personality was perfectly suited to the innovation phase of company development. Such was the difficult dynamic of his early start-ups. Reflecting on the early days of PayPal, Thiel said he would describe it as ‘risky business’: ‘The whole thing was one frightening, insane risk after another.’16 And into this came Elon Musk, he says, ‘the man who knew nothing about risk’.17 Clearly, even for Thiel and the great Silicon Valley innovators of the late 1990s, Musk was on a totally different trajectory in terms of his appetite for risk. Thiel, in his later role as a venture capitalist, has said that you always want to invest in entrepreneurs who speak in the future tense, although you also want to make sure they are not simply crazy.

For Thiel, the key is to find the people who ‘have very powerful and definite visions of the future’.18 People like Elon Musk. ‘The internal versions of Tesla and SpaceX in Silicon Valley is that they could never succeed and people were deeply sceptical and there were so many different pieces you had to get to work together in just the right way. If you multiplied all the probabilities, it was just going to fail. You could not build a new car company – there were too many different pieces you had to get to work.’19

Thiel relates a conversation he had with Musk in 2008 that perfectly sums up the South African’s approach to innovation: ‘I asked him when had the last new successful car company been created in the United States? The answer was Jeep in 1941 … There’s been no new car company in 67 years, therefore it must be a very hard thing to do and therefore you should not do it.’20 Musk considered Thiel’s argument, and then presented his alternative: ‘It’s been 67 years, so it must be time for a new car company.’21

‘The conversations you would have with people like Elon and Mark is that if you talk about risk they would tell you the very definite things they are going to do and prove why there is no risk at all,’22 says Thiel. For him, this is the far more interesting and fascinating part of Musk’s personality than the genius entrepreneur or the eccentricities of his personality. As he said in 2015, the complex coordination of the many different working parts and getting them to work together, and the rebooting the traditional supply chain around that product to make it work – therein lies the true genius of men like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk.

It is exactly what Musk has done with SpaceX, namely, changing the supply chain of what makes building rockets so expensive and bringing the costs down as much as possible through innovation.

For Thiel, individuals like Musk are not spoken of enough for their ‘coordinating vision to reduce risk’ around their innovative ideas. For him, whether Steve Jobs was a horrible human being who sometimes mistreated his employees should not be the biggest question. Rather, it should be why these people continued to work for him and believe in his ideas. In looking at Elon Musk, it’s an equally important distinction to make if you want to understand the genius rather than just understand the man.

People like Musk are not ignorant of risk. They simply believe implicitly that they have the answers. And when you work for Elon Musk, you should know what you are getting into. It’s been a familiar theme for investors in Musk’s companies, namely, that if you are going to invest in Tesla or SpaceX and know full well who is leading these companies and what his personality is like, then best you buckle up for a roller-coaster of a ride in a share price that will most definitely rise and fall with your CEO’s tweets.

Anne Chinnery, in her role as operations manager at SpaceX, describes this quality as ‘risk tolerance’: ‘He (Elon) didn’t want to fail, but he wasn’t afraid of it.’23 Musk describes his own approach to risk and failure as ‘Some actions will fail, some will succeed. You want the net useful output of your set of actions to be the highest. Failure is essentially irrelevant unless it is catastrophic.’24 And let’s be honest, if you were afraid of risk and failure, a rocket company is the last thing you would create.

For Thiel, society has become so risk-averse that the likes of Elon Musk and Steve Jobs stand like beacons among us. Their ideas seem so improbable as to scare us. And yet, by a very fine margin of understanding, it is clear that the geniuses of Silicon Valley are not these crazy eccentrics but rather are far more calculated. As Thiel notes, Bill Gates said he loves working with computers because they always do exactly as they’re told. It’s almost as if these are the people who, at the most extreme edge of innovation and risk, have found no risk at all in the certainty of their vision.

It blends perfectly with Musk’s own journey of innovation.

The area where Musk speaks most about risk is SpaceX, but not in the most obvious context of exploding rockets. He does so in the broader context of Earth and the risk to humanity: ‘I don’t think we’re currently doomed, to be clear. There are people on all ranges of the spectrum, from nothing to worry about CO2 – just makes things better – to we’re doomed and there’s nothing we can do about it. I’m somewhere in the middle. My concern with CO2 is not necessarily with where we are today. But if it is accelerating and we keep going and we’re complacent, there is some risk of non-linear climate change. These are just risks that are not wise to take. Long-term, we’re going to have to have renewable energy anyway because we’ll run out of oil and gas. It has to end up with renewable and sustainable energy, it’s really a question of whether we get there sooner or later. Let’s get there sooner. It’s obvious. How long do you want to run this experiment? Even if we say there is a point one percent chance of disaster, right now we’ve only got one planet. Why run that risk? It’s crazy.’25

Musk is doing exactly what he’s always done, and how Thiel has described it. He’s looking to the future with the innovation of today, and explaining how he will eliminate the risk. Musk has described his greatest fear as the extinction of human civilisation. So now he’s doing something about that risk: ‘To be a spacefaring civilisation and for humanity to be out there among the stars and be a multiplanetary species. It’s important for the long-term survival of humanity. Life insurance for life as we know it.’26

He takes this even further to his ultimate conclusion about the value of protecting human consciousness: ‘As far as we know, this is the only place – at least in this part of the galaxy or the Milky Way – where there is consciousness. And it’s taken a long time for us to get to this point. According to the geological records, Earth’s been around for about four and a half billion years. Although it was mostly molten magma for about a half a billion years. The sun is gradually getting hotter and bigger. And over time, even in the absence of global warming, the sun will expand and it will overheat the Earth. My guess is there’s probably only several hundred million years left. That’s all we’ve got. If it took an extra ten percent longer for conscious life to evolve on Earth, it wouldn’t evolve at all because it would’ve been incinerated by the sun. So it appears that consciousness is a very rare and precious thing, and we should take whatever steps we can to preserve the light of consciousness. The window has been opened. Only now, after four and a half billion years, has that window opened. That’s a long time to wait, and it might not stay open for very long. I’m pretty optimistic by nature, but there’s some chance that window might not be open for long, and I think we should become a multiplanetary civilisation while that window is open. If we do, I think the probable outcome for Earth is even better because Mars could help Earth one day. I think we should really do our very best to become a multiplanetary species and extend our consciousness beyond Earth. And we should do it now.’27

Another example of this thought process is Musk’s views on artificial intelligence (AI): ‘I think we should be really concerned about it … I keep sounding the alarm bell … AI is a rare case where we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive, because by the time we are reactive in AI regulation it’s too late. AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation.’28

And he offers the solution to this risk – the future plan: ‘What to do about mass unemployment? This is going to be a massive social challenge. I think ultimately we’ll have to have some kind of universal basic income. I don’t think we’re going to have a choice. I think it’s going to be necessary. I want to be clear. These are not things that I wish would happen. These are simply things that I think probably will happen. If my assessment is correct, then we need to say what are we going to do about it? Some kind of a universal basic income is going to be necessary. The output of goods and services will be extremely high. With automation there will come abundance. Almost everything will get very cheap. The much harder challenge is how do people then have meaning? A lot of people derive their meaning from their employment. So if there’s no need for your labour, what’s the meaning? That’s a much harder problem to deal with.’29

It’s a familiar pattern for Musk. He thinks about ways to launch rockets but also about ways to do so sustainably without relying on fossil fuel, while at the same time admitting the challenges: ‘We cannot stop CO2 generation today without civilisation coming to a grinding halt and mass starvation and all sorts of terrible things happening.’30

He builds robots, and then thinks about the effect this will have on global unemployment and urges the world to start seriously planning for this eventuality. He’s even thinking about babies: ‘We have a serious issue with population collapse. It’s far bigger than people realise. The social support networks were not set up for a higher ratio of retirees to workers. You don’t want to have the youth effectively enslaved to take care of the elderly, which is what will happen if you have an upside-down demographic pyramid. This (the idea that Earth is overpopulated) is not true. Earth is going to face a massive population collapse over the next 20 to 30 years. Massive. Is civilisation going to die with a bang or a whimper? This is definitely going to be with a whimper. The birth rate is very low.’31

Musk is not playing a game of chance building companies on a whim. He’s actually following a very clear path of addressing what he believes are the greatest risks to humanity, and to combat these, great risks need to be taken. Carefully.

Remember the Haldeman family motto? ‘Live dangerously – carefully.’

For Peter Thiel, the greatest risks lie not with the ones the innovators and entrepreneurs themselves are taking, but rather with the ones the rest of us are not taking. For him, the tragedy is that only a handful of people like himself and Musk are ‘allowed’ to operate beyond society’s constraints, and are somehow given the freedom to do so by the very nature of their being so different, while so many others have to conform in their thinking.

At the end of his 2015 talk, Thiel remarked: ‘One of the striking things in Silicon Valley that I’ve noted is that so many of the great entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild case of Asperger’s. I think that we need to always flip this around into an indictment of our society. What does it tell you about our society, where all of us who do not have Asperger’s are at a disadvantage because the social pressures are so extreme and we’re talked out of our original, interesting, creative, heterodox ideas before they’re even fully formed.’32

It’s the great paradox of society that only when you are deemed to be so different to the norm – as an artist, creator or thinker – are you then left alone to pursue your own path. The rest of us have to fall in line. Elon Musk had to fight this in a school environment where being different was dangerous, but he then was able to revel in it – and use it to his advantage – in adulthood. He is considered so radically different to any other CEO that he’s given the freedom to do what no other CEO would ever be given the liberty to do. He can behave in a way that no traditional company or board of directors would tolerate, simply because he’s Elon Musk. Or, as he’s often said, ‘I’m just being me.’

Elon Musk is not crazy. But he certainly understands the value of having people think he’s just a little crazy, and the freedom it gives him to do the things he wants. For Musk, the ideas of the future were taking shape in his mind. And the eventual sale of PayPal gave him the financial leverage he needed to realise them.

After being removed as CEO of PayPal, Musk remained as a board member and shareholder. In 2002, eBay purchased PayPal for $1.5 billion. Musk walked away with $180 million – exactly the capital he needed to launch his big ideas. The ones that were indeed going to change the world.

Musk wasn’t the only one who felt he could now go off and leverage his big ideas. More significantly for the industry and Silicon Valley as a whole, the minds that came out of PayPal would impact the digital landscape in a myriad of influential ways. As described in Moaml Mohmmed’s PayPal Mafia, Musk was one of several PayPal entrepreneurs who redefined the world we live in today. Thiel emerged as one of the new forces behind Facebook and a formidable Silicon Valley venture capitalist, investing in Tesla and SpaceX among others. Steve Chen and Chad Hurley left to cofound YouTube. Reid Hoffman founded LinkedIn.

Musk, the boy from Pretoria, was part of a pioneering group of roughly 20 individuals who remain Silicon Valley’s most influential group of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Collectively, it is estimated that they have made over 1 005 investments into 646 companies.

But he wasn’t the only Pretoria boy making waves in Silicon Valley. Roelof Botha, the grandson of former South African foreign minister Pik Botha, was CFO of PayPal in 2001. ‘Elon recruited me to work at PayPal – I still have the original recruitment letter he signed, and my first desk at the company was right next to his,’33 he said. ‘Elon and the other guys at PayPal saw something in me and took a chance with me even though I didn’t have any work experience in America … I was given the opportunity to become the chief financial officer of the company. I was 29 years old and the chief financial officer of a billion-dollar public company in America … people were willing to take a chance on me and my future.’34

PayPal was a stepping stone for Musk, like most of the ‘PayPal Mafia’. With his earnings from the sale, he invested $100 million into starting up SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla and $10 million into SolarCity. But while this tremendous windfall precipitated the next phase of his career, there was another important reason that Musk decided to leave the office and make that two-week investment trip, which ultimately cost him his job as PayPal’s CEO.

And it would also lead to the first great tragedy of his seemingly blessed life as America’s newest dotcom multimillionaire.
