title: Musk’s Christmas Miracle
---




ELON Musk woke up on the Sunday morning before Christmas 2008. It was three months after the successful fourth launch of Falcon 1. The boy with the ideas exploding in his head suddenly found a new idea had popped up. It was one he didn’t like. It was one he didn’t know how to deal with it. It was one that frightened him.

‘I remember waking up and thinking, man, I never ever thought I was someone who would be capable of a nervous breakdown. I thought, “Nervous breakdowns? That’s ridiculous. Why would people have such a thing?” But I remember waking up and thinking, “Damn. This is the closest I’ve ever come.” It seemed pretty, pretty dark,’ he said of 2008.1

The pressure on Musk was indeed unbearable.

In 2002, he launched SpaceX. In 2004, he stepped into Tesla and the electric car market. In 2006, he launched SolarCity. In 2008, all of it was on the brink of failure against the background of a global economic meltdown and Musk’s own dwindling financial reserves.

That year was possibly the hardest of Musk’s adult life and the one that could’ve sunk every single dream and ambition he had. It was the year of three rocket failures. It was the year of his divorce from Justine. It was the year of the global recession. It was the year that his new business, Tesla, was, in his own words, ‘haemorrhaging money’. Traditional car makers such as GM and Chrysler had received huge government bailouts to keep them alive. The venture capital market certainly didn’t have the stomach for yet another car company, let alone one producing ground-breaking electric cars.

‘The year 2008 was not a good time to be a car company, especially a start-up car company, and especially an electric car start-up company. That was like stupidity squared,’ said Musk.2

‘That was definitely the worst year of my life.’3

His new girlfriend, the actress Talulah Riley, recalled how he would wake up at night screaming and seemingly in physical pain.

In a TV interview in 2008,4 Musk is seen sitting in his kitchen, with his kids running around. Wearing a simple T-shirt and jeans, he’s busy helping one child with his phone while the others clamour for his attention. It’s a typically chaotic household scene. Riley admitted rather awkwardly in the interview that after being swept off her feet by Musk, she had been brought down to earth when she stepped into a home full of screaming kids. She says there were times she wanted to leave, go back to England and never come back. And you can see that Musk is genuinely shocked by Riley’s admission – shocked in an almost childlike way that she could even have thought such a thing. He asks her, with a quizzical look on his face, ‘Really?’ Riley laughs it off in the interview, yet here is another small example of how, during an excruciatingly painful time in his professional life, Musk is dealing with the one thing he cannot find a solution for – true love.

But Musk also seems to be providing a metaphor for his current circumstances when he says to the camera, ‘There are a lot of resource conflicts when you have five kids. At any given point somebody’s taken somebody’s toy.’5

How to allocate his dwindling resources, given the reduction in his personal fortune, was a very real concern for Musk. Another was how to avoid losing all of his ‘toys’ in the process: ‘I had a tough choice there because I could either provide all of the money for SpaceX or all of the money for Tesla and then increase the chance that one of them would survive. Or I have to split the money. But if I split the money then maybe both will die. It’s almost like if you had two children and you had only so much food. What do you do?’6

SolarCity was another major cause for concern. Musk was chairman of the company, which had been founded by his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive, and he saw it as a means to integrate a sustainable energy future into Tesla.

Key to this was the development of a solar roof. Instead of simply providing solar panels for roofs in the traditional sense, SolarCity was focused on making the entire roof one giant solar panel in which the roof shingles (tiles) were actually solar panels themselves. However, the concept, like the company, seemed doomed from the start. SolarCity became an almost perfect storm in which Musk’s penchant for seeking out a grandiose idea to transform an industry, selling the concept to investors and then working out the details later would not succeed.

Leaving aside the SolarCity debacle for a moment, both SpaceX and Tesla were draining Musk of financial resources. SpaceX had sapped his personal fortune. Everything he had made from the sale of PayPal was gone. He was broke. A $20 million investment by Peter Thiel helped to stabilise SpaceX, but it wasn’t nearly enough. The only project on their books was a satellite launch for Malaysia. But the customer would only pay in the case of a successful launch. The Falcon 1 that the SpaceX team had salvaged and barely put together in a week was their last working rocket.

It was estimated that by late 2008, Musk had about $30 million in cash left. He recalled this time: ‘Even though the fourth launch of SpaceX succeeded, we were still running out of money. We had three failures and only one success. And then the financing round for Tesla had not closed. We were two or three days to closing before Christmas. I thought this could be a really bad end of the year where both companies could fail. Sleep was difficult.’7

Faced with his difficult decision of where to place his last bet, Musk opted to split the money he had left between SpaceX and Tesla: ‘The difficulty in those situations is there are so many responsibilities that you have to the employees and to the investors who have come along. I would’ve been really disappointed if I would not have been able to keep my responsibilities to have the companies survive.’8

Juggling all of this clearly took its toll on Musk, and he worked a punishing and unsustainable schedule. ‘For a long time it was over 100 hours a week,’ he said of his work schedule at the time. ‘That’s a very high amount of pain. The difficulty and pain of work hours really increases exponentially. It’s not linear. When the financial crisis hit in 2008 and 2009, it was just every day, seven days a week. Dreaming about work. It was terrible.’9

He hadn’t even been able to attend the historic fourth launch of Falcon 1 in person because of his need to be in California trying to keep both SpaceX and Tesla alive. That year Tesla had to lay off 18 per cent of its workforce as it struggled to remain afloat.

But 2008 was also the year of Musk’s very own Christmas Miracle. In those tumultuous three days over Christmas, everything changed. And it started with a phone call from space.

‘NASA called and told me we’d won a $1.5 billion contract for SpaceX. I just blurted out, “I love you guys”,’ says Musk.10 As he tells the story, his eyes are watering. The call came to Musk’s cellphone on Monday morning 22 December. A press release was issued on 23 December, stating that SpaceX had been contracted to provide 12 flights for commercial resupply services (CRS) to the ISS. As he told Eric Berger, ‘Without the CRS contract, we would have gone down as that company that made it to orbit, and then died.’11

Then, on Christmas Eve, Tesla’s investors decided to pump more money into the business with a $40-million cash injection. In the space of only a few days, Musk and his companies had been saved. The ‘toys’ were safe.

There was a very clear reason why Musk couldn’t decide between his ‘children’ – SpaceX and Tesla – opting instead to split his remaining funding between the two. It went deeper than just his loyalties to employees and shareholders. It was at the core of his vision when he started out and identified the three things he believed would have the greatest impact on humanity – the Internet, transitioning to a sustainable-energy economy and space exploration, including the extension of life to multiple planets.



THE real problem with SolarCity came in 2016 when Musk – a major shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity – convinced his Tesla investors to purchase SolarCity to the value of $2.6 billion. In 2016, Musk unveiled what he called the Tesla Solar Roof, using the SolarCity roof concept. The idea was that the entire roof of a person’s home would be able to feed energy into the Tesla Powerwall, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery unit installed in the home which would then charge their Tesla vehicles. It was going to be a seamless integration of green energy that would further transform the sector and, Musk argued, make Tesla even more dominant and self-sustaining.

But the problem was that SolarCity itself was not a successful company. In fact, it was failing at an alarming rate. It was not meeting its production demand and promises for some critical reasons that Musk surprisingly seemed to overlook, or chose to ignore. First, it didn’t really have a product. Or rather, its product was not yet fully refined before it was already being sold. It has since been revealed that when he launched the solar roof in 2016, on the old set of Desperate Housewives, it wasn’t actually a fully functioning product and Musk even had concerns about the design. Some critics have even suggested that the solar shingles Musk displayed at the launch were fake.

Second, the idea of being more than just a company providing solar panels, and rather being a company that installs solar roofs, brought with it significant challenges that Musk had not foreseen. Designing and providing solar panels is a far different prospect to designing and building roofs. As a result, unforeseen installation costs began to emerge, and these were passed on to angry consumers. As a Vanity Fair article observed in 2019, ‘The real engineering that took place at SolarCity, in short, was financial, not environmental.’12 And finally, the market demand for solar roofs just wasn’t there at the time, with a significant slowdown in this sector.

Tesla investors, themselves concerned about their own company at the time, were sceptical about the acquisition of a company that was not just deep in debt and laying off staff at the time but essentially insolvent. In 2017, the Tesla shareholders dragged Musk to court over a deal they believed amounted to little more than a Tesla bailout of a failing company.

Musk’s plans that SolarCity would become the new Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York (following the original Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada, where lithium-ion batteries are produced), were also on the rocks. The company was given a highly favourable ten-year lease by the Buffalo city council on the grounds that the plant would employ a certain number of staff and create jobs in a very poor community.

In 2020, all of Tesla’s directors – excluding Musk – agreed to a settlement of $60 million. A settlement was also reached with retail giant Walmart, which had sued Tesla after solar panels supplied by SolarCity caught fire at seven stores, resulting in millions of dollars in damage.

But Musk instead decided to move ahead with the trial involving the Tesla shareholders, denying any wrongdoing in this matter and determined to clear his name. During the trial, which is still ongoing, Musk repeatedly denied pressuring the Tesla board into agreeing to the merger despite evidence presented that he did indeed have a significant influence over the deal, and that he was also aware of SolarCity’s financial difficulties at the time. To his credit, Musk has admitted that ‘significant mistakes’ were made, specifically regarding installations.

But the SolarCity debacle again brought to the fore the dichotomy of Musk. He has consistently shown himself to be an incredible innovator and engineer with an ability to make the impossible possible, and to move entire industries forward with his disruptive approach. On the whole, society needs thinkers of the calibre of Elon Musk. But such mavericks do not necessarily make good bosses or company CEOs.

Innovation is a risky business. Running a company is a far more conservative affair. If a healthy balance between the two is not there, risk becomes recklessness. When Musk urged his early SpaceX employees to follow the Silicon Valley mantra of ‘Move fast and break things’, it spurred them on to great innovation in rocketry. But it doesn’t overlook the fact that there will be collateral damage, as things will break. Musk has shown from his earliest days at PayPal that he is a far better innovator than he is a CEO.



SOMEHOW, space had jumped the queue in the sense that Musk had founded SpaceX before he became involved in Tesla and SolarCity. But Tesla was just as important to him and his process, and he couldn’t let the company fail.

And once again, Tesla is a perfect example of the way Musk’s mind works. His original intention was not to become a car manufacturer so much as it was to accelerate the shift towards electric vehicles. In his mind, the progress that had been made towards achieving this was staggeringly slow – much like the stagnation he had seen in space exploration.

The majority of the companies Musk has started or become involved with reflect his desire to force the pace of change at a macro level. It perhaps explains why Musk still views himself as more of an engineer – and proudly so – than a businessman or entrepreneur. The companies, and even their successes and profits, are merely the vehicle for Musk’s desire to use them as a catalyst for greater change. A change in humanity’s vision for the future. A change in humanity’s approach to the present.

In essence, if you want to save the planet, create the companies that are capable of doing so. This is also where comparisons between Musk and Steve Jobs diverge. Musk has been labelled the Steve Jobs of his time, with a vision of making space travel and electric cars sexy and accessible – albeit not yet affordable – to the general population. Musk certainly knows the value of a good-looking product, or, as he has said, something you truly fall in love with.

His motivation for creating a good-looking product, in the case of Tesla in particular, goes beyond profit. If it was purely profit, Musk would never have considered starting two companies – SpaceX and Tesla – in which his most optimistic outcome for success was around ten per cent: ‘If you’re trying to convince people to make life more miserable for themselves, this is a hard argument to win. When we created Tesla, we said we have to make a car that’s exciting and fun and looks good.’13 ‘The whole purpose behind Tesla – the reason I put so much of my time and money into helping create the business – is we want to serve as a catalyst accelerating the electric car revolution.

‘The price of gas at the pump does not reflect the true cost of gasoline because you have a consumption of a public good. It’s the same in fishing. Because there is no cost to fishing stocks, people just overfish and disaster ensues. Here we’re not paying for the cost of the concentration of CO2 in the oceans and the atmosphere, we’re not paying for all the ancillary effects – the wars and all the other things – at the gas pumps. You effectively had a subsidy taking place at the gas pump because of that. So the only way to bridge that is with innovation, is to try to make electric cars better sooner than they would otherwise be.’14

Jobs wanted you to buy an iPhone so he built a company that made technology less geeky and more trendy. Musk wants you to buy a future. If he has to start an electric car company to do so, then he will. And yes, there needs to be a profit and he is not entirely utopian in acknowledging this.

It’s a thought process that comes through in Musk’s visions for space exploration. It is more than two decades since he first started dreaming about going to Mars. In Musk’s mind, that is 19 years in which it still hasn’t happened. He doesn’t describe this as simply disappointing or a failure. Musk takes it personally. He calls it an outrage that humanity hasn’t yet made it to Mars.

But as much as he cannot be defined as just an entrepreneur, he also cannot be classed with climate activists such as Greta Thunberg. He falls outside this spectrum as well, although he does speak a similar climate language. But as Justine so aptly pointed out, Musk’s ability not to belong to one or the other tribe, but rather to move between the tribes, is his greatest asset.

According to the US Department of Energy, the first electric vehicle made its debut on the streets of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1890, not far at all from the birthplace of chiropractic and the first adjustment performed by Daniel David Palmer in 1895, which would become a part of Musk’s family history as well. In the mind of Elon Musk, the lack of real progress towards a viable electric car, never mind an electric car company, was baffling. Two other entrepreneurs, Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard, had felt the same.

And it was in fact they, and not Musk, who first did something about it.
