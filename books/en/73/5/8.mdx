title: Is Elon Musk Boring?
---




ON 17 December 2016, Musk summed up all of our frustrations when he tweeted, ‘Traffic is driving me nuts.’ But in the mind of Elon Musk, it didn’t just end there: ‘Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging,’ he followed up. And, in case you were foolhardy enough to not believe him, he added, ‘I am actually going to do this.’

Frustrated with the endless traffic problems of Los Angeles, Musk found himself dreaming up a tunnel system that would alleviate congestion on the roads. He decided to set up an infrastructure company, The Boring Company (quite literally, to bore tunnels), that would aim at doing just that. According to The Boring Company, the decision to go for tunnels rather than, say, flying cars – equally improbable but perhaps not out of the question when it comes to Musk – boils down to the fact that tunnels are ‘weatherproof, out of sight, and won’t fall on your head’.1 For Musk, the fact that tunnels can be built in three dimensions – in that they could be stacked in what he refers to as a 3D network of tunnels – allows the creation of an almost endless network that can accommodate even the most aggressive expansion of a city. Albeit with the necessary regulatory approvals.

The vision of The Boring Company is to ‘solve traffic, enable rapid point-to-point transportation and transform cities’. Simple as that. For most of us, Musk had us at ‘solve traffic’. Once again, Musk had a grand vision for humanity, perhaps not on the scale of saving the planet but one that would certainly preserve the sanity of millions of road users in busy cities. All of us can get behind a cause that will make our daily commute that much faster and more pleasurable. Even more so when the company comes with a bit of marketing razzmatazz that includes a tongue-in-cheek name rather than something like ‘Traffic Infrastructure Solutions’.

With The Boring Company, Musk yet again displayed one of the qualities that his fans love. He envisions something everybody has talked about, but he doesn’t just talk about it. He actually gets things done. Even the most far-fetched idea becomes a reality in Musk’s hands. Think what you will of Musk, there is no denying his ability – and general modus operandi – to identify an industry, pinpoint its flaws and then attack it with gusto. It is problem-solving, or engineering, of the highest order. Or perhaps a re-engineering of the structures that society has become so accustomed to that no new thought has been put into how they can be done better. And once Musk goes public with his plans and ideas, there follows a certain amount of scepticism. But in the background, Musk achieves two very critical goals. He reignites a conversation around a particular topic and becomes the stimulus that fast-tracks innovation and progress in this area. Musk said as much when he described one of the goals of Tesla as the acceleration of the shift towards electric vehicles becoming the norm and no longer just an emissions-control ideal that remains on the drawing board. In the case of The Boring Company, Musk’s twofold goal is to dig tunnels faster and at a fraction of the current cost.

The Boring Company is certainly evidence of how Musk moves from idea to actualisation. After founding the company, Musk quite literally began digging. He and his team dug a hole in the SpaceX parking lot in Hawthorne. Initially, he was told it would take two weeks to dig a hole of any consequence. Musk’s response was to start on a Friday afternoon and ‘see what’s the biggest hole we can dig between now and Sunday afternoon’.2 This is not a man who wastes time overthinking big ideas. By 2018, members of the public could explore the first stretch of a 1.6-kilometre test tunnel.

He has developed tunnel boring machines (TBMs) that are named after famous poems and plays; the first was Godot, after Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. After Godot came Line-Storm, so named after a Robert Frost poem. And then came Prufrock, named after TS Eliot’s ‘The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock’.

Prufrock is touted as a major upgrade in tunnel boring technology, in that it is able to ‘porpoise’. According to The Boring Company website, ‘it launches directly from the surface, mines underground, and re-emerges upon completion. This allows Prufrock to begin tunnelling within 48 hours of arrival onsite and eliminates the need to excavate expensive pits to launch and retrieve the machine’. It is said to tunnel six times faster than Godot and Line-Storm. The Boring Company does note that it still moves ‘four to five times slower than a garden snail … but Prufrock is catching up’.

The Boring Company currently offers various tunnel products, from the Loop (an underground public transportation system) to utility, freight and pedestrian tunnels. It also sells a fifth tunnel option simply called Bare – ‘We build the tunnel, you put what you want into it’.

Loop is one of the more interesting tunnel concepts because of the way it fits into Musk’s ecosystem of companies. Loop is planned as an ‘all-electric, zero-emissions, high-speed underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported to their destination with no intermediate stops’. It fits into the broader picture of the Hyperloop, a project being worked on by a number of companies, including Musk’s. The Hyperloop is a proposed system of ground transportation for people and cargo that would facilitate travel at high speeds in tubes either above or below ground. In the case of public transport, these low-pressure tubes would carry people in pods moving at up to 1 200 km/h. The ultimate goal would be for this to replace traditional road and rail travel. The idea is not a new one, but Musk has been instrumental in reigniting the discussion around it. Followers of his version of Hyperloop have referred to it as ‘Teslas in Tunnels!’ It’s a seamless integration – from building an electric car to building underground highways for your electric cars.

The first Loop was built for the Las Vegas Convention Center, and began operating in April 2021. It features two 1.2-kilometre tunnels in which chauffeur-driven Teslas whisk visitors around the less than one square kilometre of the convention centre. It’s impressive, but a far cry from ‘solving traffic’.

Much in the same way as he approached SpaceX, Musk has sought to redevelop the tunnelling value chain and decrease the costs associated with digging tunnels. Musk publicly declared that The Boring Company would aim to build tunnels at a cost of approximately $10 million per mile, as opposed to the current cost of between $100 million and $1 billion per mile. Among the most obvious cost-saving methods is enhancing current TBMs to make them more efficient, creating a more automated tunnelling system and making the tunnels themselves narrower to reduce their cost. It is worth noting that all of The Boring Company’s tunnel offerings are a single diameter.

As with all of Musk’s ideas and projects, The Boring Company has met with scepticism from critics. A number of deals have fallen through, and many promises seem too good to be true. And yet, both Musk and The Boring Company keep digging. Musk is reported to have had inquiries for tunnels in Australia, Europe and China. But it remains in its infancy, and the leap from Loop to Hyperloop is also still a giant and very costly one to make.

The general reaction to Musk’s plans remains muted. But Teslarati, a media company that focuses on all things Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, believes they’ve seen this all before. Under the headline ‘The Boring Company skeptics are making the same mistakes as Tesla and SpaceX critics’, writer Simon Alvarez argues that The Boring Company is following exactly the same historical pattern as all of Musk’s previous ideas and companies: ‘Elon Musk himself has proven over the years that even conventionally insane ideas – such as landing the first stage of an orbital rocket on a drone in the middle of the ocean or scaling the production of a mass-market electric car – could be feasible if enough work is put into them.

‘It is easy to mock or dismiss the ideas of people like Elon Musk and his teams at The Boring Company, SpaceX, and Tesla. But inasmuch as Musk’s companies make it pretty easy to target them due to their goals and nature, SpaceX and Tesla’s history shows that more often than not, it is a mistake to bet against Musk and his team of visionaries, almost all of whom seem to have the tendency to think outside the box by default.’3

Or, in the words of Musk’s former business partner Peter Thiel, ‘Never bet against Elon Musk.’ But many investors are also trying to answer the question of whether it is worth betting on Musk’s getting it right every time.

Sitting behind a tab at the top right of The Boring Company homepage is a link to a product that has nothing to do with tunnelling but has created even more controversy, and even led to legislation: the Flamethrower.

Musk designed his own flamethrower, and used it to launch The Boring Company. As someone in tune with contemporary pop culture, he knew that zombies and the apocalypse are wildly popular genres. Zombies as a cultural phenomenon have given rise to a billion-dollar industry in the US. So Musk produced 20 000 flamethrowers with the promise that the device ‘Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!’ He charged $500 per flamethrower. He sold out in less than a week. And with $10 million, The Boring Company suddenly had seed capital.

The New York State Senate wasn’t impressed and passed a bill that made possession of a flamethrower for recreational activities a crime: ‘Elon Musk’s Boring Company released a new flamethrower which sold out of all 20 000 within days, without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying. Allowing the general public to access this type of machine is extremely problematic. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals,’4 the lawmakers argued.

And yet it’s still there on the company homepage. But a click on Flamethrower takes you to a page headed ‘The Boring Company NOT a Flamethrower’. And it simply reports ‘20 000 Not-a-Flamethrowers Sold – fire extinguishers sold separately’. Below it is a tweet from Musk: ‘The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false.’

At the end of all of this remains the obvious question: is The Boring Company a success? The simple answer is no. Not now. The more intriguing answer, though, is not yet.



MUSK is equally intrigued with the ‘tunnels’ that make up the neural networks in the brain. But whereas most of the projects he undertakes hold some hope for the future, he has expressed darker thoughts about the one that concerns him the most – artificial intelligence.

Commonly known as AI, artificial intelligence is the rapidly growing field of computer science that keeps pushing the boundaries of building machines or programming them to be capable of performing human tasks. Or, put more plainly, creating robots that can do the same things human beings can.

For Musk, the greatest danger lies not in AI in itself, but rather AI that is left unchecked and unregulated. He has compared this scenario to rule by a dictator, but worse: ‘At least when there is an evil dictator, that human is going to die. But for AI there would be no death. It would live forever, and then you’d have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape’.5

Musk is not just concerned about AI; he is genuinely frightened by it: ‘I’m really quite close to the cutting edge of AI, and it scares the hell out of me. It’s capable of vastly more than anyone knows, and the rate of improvement is exponential.’6

And he’s most concerned that he appears to be one of the few individuals at his level of interaction who is so concerned about it. Even his own Autopilot technology at Tesla has shown the complex – and sometimes dangerous – relationship between humans and machines programmed to try and think like humans.

Musk has long spoken out about the dangers of AI. In fact, he believes governments not only have been too slow in regulating AI but are actually too late. Developments in AI are now moving faster than legislation can ever hope to keep up. As he says, ‘When the robots are walking down the street with us, then it’s too late …7 We have to figure out some way to ensure that the advent of digital super intelligence is one that is symbiotic with humanity. That’s the single biggest existential crisis that we face, and the most pressing one.’8

Musk certainly appears to have a genuine fear of what AI could do to humanity, perhaps recalling the Terminator movies of his youth. Musk has often expressed concerns about DeepMind, a British company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc that focuses on AI development. ‘Just the nature of the AI that they’re building is one that crushes all humans at all games,’9 he has said. It doesn’t seem a particularly harsh threat – a robot beating you at chess. But in Musk’s mind, where he has often pontificated as to whether we are not all already living in some kind of artificial simulation that operates much like a game, the words ‘crushes all humans at all games’ are far more chilling. The rate at which AI learns chess and other games, moving to beating world champions within the space of a few months – what takes years for a human to learn – is what concerns him.

On a more basic level, Musk has expressed fears that AI will enable robots to perform tasks so much more effectively and cheaply than humans that humans will become obsolete, leading to mass unemployment on a scale that would require massive government assistance.

Musk has tweeted that humanity should be more concerned about AI than about North Korea, as AI is ‘far more dangerous’. More dangerous than nuclear weapons. He sometimes speaks about AI in terms of an apocalypse of the machines, and has predicted that it will overtake humanity within five years.

Essentially, Musk is asking for greater regulatory oversight of AI, the lack of which he has described as ‘insane’. Musk breaks this down as the difference between ‘narrow AI’ and ‘species-level-risk AI’. An example of narrow AI would be the social media algorithms that control what you see on Facebook or Twitter. Species-level-risk AI is digital super-intelligence. Musk believes that a safer future lies in the symbiosis of humanity with AI, so that AI maximises humanity’s freedom of action rather than completely replaces it.

Neuralink, another Musk company, defines itself as ‘Breakthrough technology for the brain’. Through Neuralink, Musk and his team are planning to implant technology in the human brain that will enable paraplegics to perform certain tasks with the help of technology. This will be controlled by a Neuralink device that sits behind a person’s ear, much like a hearing aid. Future goals are to manipulate brain function for Alzheimer’s patients and possibly help to improve other disorders in the brain and spine. Maximising the freedom of action of humanity.

For Musk, Neuralink is not a contradiction in terms of his concerns about AI, it’s a solution – the belief that a human brain should still control the machine through the Neuralink interface, and that the robots shouldn’t be left to control themselves.

For the sceptical, the way Musk smoothly transitions from a doomsday prophecy about unregulated AI, pausing as he ends sentences such as ‘This is the most important thing we will ever do’, and then offers a solution, one that he happens to be the founder and owner of, is a wonderful sales tool. A realist would say he’s seen too many science-fiction films and sometimes defaults a little too easily to the Terminator and Matrix scenarios, in which warnings are not heeded and machines ultimately take over the world.

Clearly, when a man who generally does not like government regulation, and who quite easily could profit from less of it, calls for tighter regulation, this should be a red flag. And before you drift off to sleep, you remember Musk’s words: ‘The nature of the AI that they’re building is one that crushes all humans at all games.’ If we are busy teaching AI how to play the game of life …

Whether it be in space, on land, in tunnels under the earth, or deep inside the human brain, Musk is having an impact at many levels.

And there is nothing artificial about his influence.
