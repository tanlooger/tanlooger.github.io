IN October 2001, Elon Musk and two friends – Adeo Ressi and Jim Cantrell – sat in a room with a few Russians. On the table was enough vodka to slay a Siberian tiger. And on the negotiating table, figuratively, was a desire to make a purchase. Musk wanted to buy missiles. In particular, he was looking for surplus Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

‘It was a very trippy experience. It was very bizarre,’ he later told CBS’s 60 Minutes.1

Musk’s idea was part of an elaborate publicity stunt. He had his eye on buying three SS-18 missiles, one of the world’s most powerful ICBMs, with a range of up to 11 000 km. First designed in the 1960s for use by the Soviet Union’s Strategic Rocket Forces, the SS-18 has been through a process of refinement ever since. It was originally designed to give the Soviet Union a powerful ‘first-strike’ option against its enemies, with the United States the obvious target. From a land-based launch in Russia, the SS-18 would take only 30 minutes to reach the United States. It is a missile of immense proportions capable of carrying up to ten nuclear warheads. NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) refers to it by the delightful name of ‘Satan’.

Negotiating with the Russians to buy missiles was rather like negotiating with the Prince of Darkness himself. The boardroom battles of Zip2 and PayPal clearly paled in comparison to negotiating a missile contract with a bunch of Russians who don’t take you seriously when you tell them you want to go into space.

And that’s exactly what Musk sought the ICBMs for – to launch his space exploration plans.

Musk’s idea for the missiles had come a year earlier. It was on a drive back from a weekend in the Hamptons with Adeo Ressi, and the two friends were mulling over what to do next with their careers. Musk had concluded the PayPal deal, and Ressi was busy building a fortune from his own Internet ventures.

The two started talking about space. What was at first just a fanciful discussion suddenly became an exploration of what it would actually cost to get there. When he got out of the car, Ressi perhaps dismissed the conversation as just an interesting way to pass the time on the drive. But Musk’s mind had locked on to his next target. In fact, it had actually just zeroed in on his boyhood ambition. Zip2, PayPal and the entire Internet itself were just stepping stones for Musk towards his grandest idea of all – space.

And specifically Mars.

But Musk had identified funding as one of the greatest stumbling blocks to reaching space. He believed a dwindling public appetite for costly space programmes had contributed to the funding problem.

But Mars ticked two important boxes in Musk’s vision. First, he could change the narrative of space exploration as being a fruitless and expensive waste of taxpayers’ money and bring back an appetite for exploration. His publicly stated desire was not just to explore space for exploration’s sake but to actually make humans a multiplanetary species. As always, the way Musk frames his vision is always key to how he sells it. And, second, Mars represented the furthest reaches of human space exploration by astronauts.

Under the initial name of Mars Oasis, Musk devised an idea to build a transportable biosphere, or greenhouse, and launch it on a rocket to Mars, where it would hopefully be able to grow the first interplanetary plants. Then there was also the idea to send mice to Mars and bring them back alive, as a way of convincing the public that Mars was worth going to. As Musk himself has said, ‘I’d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.’

All of this would be an attempt to convince the public once more that space exploration was a good thing – and, most importantly, that it was feasible. And this recently cashed-up Internet millionaire was determined to be the one to prove this.

He had the money. He had the vision. He had the plants. He had the mice. But he had no rocket.

Musk persuaded Ressi and another engineer, Jim Cantrell, to join his fledgling team under the company name of ‘Life to Mars’. Cantrell, who had the most experience in the space industry, advised them to fly to Paris and meet with Arianespace, a launch services company responsible for the launch of the majority of Europe’s satellites. But the meeting with Arianespace executives proved fruitless as Musk, Ressi and Cantrell decided that the cost of the ‘launch vehicle’ was too expensive.

However, the meeting with Arianespace opened up another option: Russia. The French and the Russians had been collaborating in the space race since the late 1960s. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the new Russian space corporation Roscosmos saw Arianespace as an opportunity to enter the Western market. And Mars would become a common theme for Roscosmos, Arianespace and NASA, as it was for Musk. For the South African, the drive to go into space and the formation of SpaceX would represent the fulfilment of a journey that began in the mind of a Pretoria boy. The global space race would suck Musk into its vortex in the most unlikely of ways. Through the Internet. Or rather, the formation of the Internet, for which we have the Russians to thank.
