ON 6 May 2002, ‘Life on Mars’ became the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX. With a handful of employees and a factory in Hawthorne, California, Musk and his team of intrepid space engineers began the work of building their first rocket.

Their goal was the Russians, or rather, answering a question Russian space exploration had raised in Musk’s mind: ‘Why is it that the Russians can build these low-cost launch vehicles? We don’t drive Russian cars or fly Russian planes or have Russian kitchen appliances. I felt the US is a pretty competitive place, and we should be able to build a cost-efficient launch vehicle.’1

To start with, Musk compiled a feasibility study that looked at all of the engineers who had been involved with the major launch vehicle developments over the last three decades. Together with his small team of hand-picked engineers, he spent a number of Saturdays poring over solutions to the problems of launch cost and reliability.

For Musk, the two were intrinsically linked: ‘We really focused on reducing the cost across the board. For one thing, our overhead in a 30-person company is an order of magnitude less than it is in Lockheed and Boeing. Every decision we made was with consideration to simplicity. That improves the reliability as well as reduces your cost. Fewer components means fewer components that can go wrong and fewer components to buy.’2

It is for exactly this reason that 80 per cent of what SpaceX uses to go into space is made in their own factory. ‘The space supply chain is very expensive and you have very few options – often only one supplier,’3 Musk said in an interview with Planetary Radio. ‘If we didn’t make stuff ourselves, we would be beholden to those legacy costs. If you’re going to try and create a revolutionary rocket that’s substantially lower cost and aspires to be higher reliability and where we intend to try and make reusability work, then it’s very difficult to use much of the existing supply chain because you will inherit those costs. So we had to do it.’4

The final frontier is more a bank balance than a far-flung solar system, and space is indeed a black hole capable of swallowing billions of dollars in the blink of an eye. This is why, in a feature on 60 Minutes, host Scott Pelley states matter-of-factly, ‘Only four entities have launched a space capsule into orbit and successfully brought it back. The United States, Russia, China … and Elon Musk.’5 It’s a staggering declaration. Humanity’s journey to the stars boils down to three countries, and one independent man.

One of the problems Musk had with the space industry was the exorbitant contracts dished out by government to the likes of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and how this created a culture of payment for failure. It’s one of the reasons space exploration has been for so long the preserve of government, because only government had the resources to keep paying for rockets that blew up. When SpaceX had grown to the point that it could secure NASA contracts, it was on the premise that these would be paid for meeting certain targets. Failure was always an option for Musk, but he quite clearly believed that the contractual basis upon which failure was still being rewarded was hampering the growth of the industry and stifling innovation.

At the age of 30, Musk and Justine moved from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, the hub of America’s aerospace industry, to launch SpaceX. He had found his factory space in Hawthorne. He had his core team, who celebrated moving into their new office space with a mariachi band, and with Musk waving around two wooden maracas. And he had his vision.

It was time to get to work on his first rocket – the Falcon 1.

SpaceX’s first rocket was named after the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars franchise. Joe Johnston, the original Star Wars modelmaker, had four weeks to build the model and described it as one of the most intense projects he’d ever worked on. Musk and his team had slightly more time, but building Falcon 1 would be more intense by several orders of magnitude. And it would test Musk to the absolute limit of not only his finances but his sanity as well.
