title: Sputnik and the Space Race
---




On Saturday 5 October 1957, Americans woke to newspaper headlines such as this: ‘Satellite fired by Russia: Circling US 15 times a day’. Another headline read ‘Russia wins race to launch Earth satellite’.

What became known as the ‘Sputnik crisis’ had begun.

It is ironic that the greatest achievements in the field of space exploration have come about because of the threat of war on Earth. From the moment Sputnik 1 was launched by the Soviet Union into low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, the space race was on. And the Soviet Union was firmly in the lead.

The Soviets were bullish, and the Americans were fearful.

The Soviets had used an ICBM to launch Sputnik, and that sent two very clear messages to the US. First, the Soviets had something up there that could keep an eye on the US. This bothered everyone from the man mowing his lawn in Cleveland to the top military brass in the Department of Defense. Something up there in space – something Russian – was watching. The second concern was that Russia had missiles carrying nuclear warheads capable of reaching space, which in turn meant they were more than capable of reaching the US as well.

Sputnik 1 sparked an even greater panic in the West that the Soviets had become the dominant superpower. Some Americans even claimed they could hear the ‘beep, beep, beep’ sound made by Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead. The economist Bernard Baruch wrote an open letter to the New York Herald Tribune in which he issued a warning under the title of ‘The Lessons of Defeat’: ‘While we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets, the Soviet Union is conquering space. While America grumbles over taxes and cuts the cloak of its defence to the cloth of its budget, Russia is launching intercontinental missiles. Suddenly, rudely, we are awakened to the fact that the Russians have outdistanced us in a race which we thought we were winning. It is Russia, not the United States, who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it. America is worried. It should be.’1

The American public was indeed worried. Official NASA chief historian Roger D Launius wrote that the launch of Sputnik 1 had a ‘Pearl Harbor’ effect on American public opinion: ‘It was a shock, introducing the average citizen to the space age in a crisis setting. The event created an illusion of a technological gap and provided the impetus for increased spending for aerospace endeavors, technical and scientific educational programs, and the chartering of new federal agencies to manage air and space research and development. Not only had the Soviets been first in orbit, but Sputnik 1 weighed nearly 200 pounds, compared to the intended 3.5 pounds for the first satellite to be launched in Project Vanguard [the American programme to launch a satellite into space]. In the Cold War environment of the late 1950s, this disparity of capability portended menacing implications.’2

The American historian Daniel J Boorstin noted: ‘Never before had so small and so harmless an object created such consternation.’3 Another historian, Walter A McDougall, added: ‘No event since Pearl Harbor set off such repercussions in public life.’4

And when the trademark ‘beep, beep, beep’ signal of Sputnik 1 was broadcast by American radio stations, it was received by the public like a metronome of pure terror beeping out the coming red wave of communism they so feared. Americans had been convinced they were living in the world’s greatest country at the dawn of an age of plenty and material progress. Sputnik 1’s signal tolled like a death knell of the American dream.

In February 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower authorised the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later to become the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA). ARPA would lead to the creation of ARPANET and later the Internet that so fascinated Musk and provided the launchpad for his own ambitions. ARPA would become the vanguard of the US effort to surpass the Soviet Union as millions of dollars were poured into the development of science and technology.

In February 1958, the first American satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into orbit. In July 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act. NASA was born. It speaks volumes that only 11 years later, astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon. Space was a priority, and it received the required funding and attention.

And Mars also played a role in the space race.

In the 1960s, the Russians launched a series of probes intended to reach Mars. NASA made the first successful flyby of Mars in 1965, and Mariner 9 made the first orbit of Mars in November 1971. The Russians then raised the bar when they became the first to land probes on the surface of Mars, in November and December of 1971. However, neither of the two probes achieved a ‘soft landing’, and only one was briefly able to transmit signals. In 1976, NASA successfully landed Viking 1 and Viking 2, and the world was presented with the first colour images of the Red Planet.

Since then, China, India and the European Space Agency have joined NASA in successfully sending spacecraft to Mars.

But it was a project launched in the early 1990s, when NASA began working on a Mars observation balloon, that would intersect with Musk’s own Mars ambitions.

The French had also been working on a Mars balloon. But the French were planning to send their balloon to Mars aboard a Russian rocket. With the opening up of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s, the French suggested that NASA join them in a tripartite Mars balloon project with Russia. A talented young American engineer had secured a place on this project. His name was Jim Cantrell. It was the beginning of American and Russian space cooperation, which would eventually lead to the International Space Station (ISS). And it later led to cooperation of a private kind, when Cantrell suggested to Musk that he could indeed build his own rockets.

As a result of his role on the Mars balloon project, Cantrell had spent quite a bit of time in Russia working with Russian engineers, so he had a keen understanding of the lay of the land and the workings of the Russian space industry. Ironically, the biggest threat to the further exploration of Mars at the time was a new development on Earth – peace. The collapse of the Soviet Union ended the Cold War and heralded a new era of peace, but it almost stopped the space race as well. The reduction of the threat of war meant that both Russian and American defence funding to keep pushing the boundaries of space dried up.

However, this coincided with the growing privatisation of spaceflight. The space race was moving from government-centralised programmes to a multitude of private endeavours. Today, there are a range of private space companies offering everything from launch vehicles, cargo transport, crew transport, landers, rovers, orbiters, research craft, propulsion manufacturers and satellite launchers to space manufacturing, space mining, space settlement and more. The final frontier is now very much the home of cosmic capitalism, fuelled by billionaires with deep enough pockets for deep space. From Musk’s SpaceX to Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, they are opening up space like never before, and offering everything from official collaboration with NASA and government space projects to individual space travel for wealthy earthlings. But there are still perceptions to overcome.

‘The general public doesn’t understand the difference between getting to space and getting to orbit,’ says Musk in an interview with Charlie Rose. ‘There’s a very big difference. To do a suborbital flight you need a terminal velocity of around Mach 3. To get to orbit you need a terminal velocity of Mach 25. It’s a huge difference. There are a number of efforts in the suborbital category that certainly can grow one day to orbital. Jeff Bezos has an effort. Richard Branson is funding that development at Scaled Composites in California. We’re in the orbit class. It’s a lot more capital and that’s where you’re really pushing the ragged edge of what’s physically possible. In the rocket business, the rocket company does the launch. It’s not like the airline business. You don’t sell the rocket, you sell the launch.’

And that was the initial aim for SpaceX – to be the cheapest launch services company on the market.

Cantrell was an early ally of Musk in this new world. In 2001, Cantrell was working as a private consultant in the space industry when Musk approached him with the idea of purchasing rockets to reach Mars. Because of Cantrell’s contacts in the Russian space industry, when the door closed at Arianespace, Russia emerged as a solution, and a particularly cheap one at that, as they were said to be selling refurbished ICBMs at a fraction of the cost.

And that’s how Musk, Ressi and Cantrell arrived in Moscow in October 2001. But in that first vodka-fuelled meeting, the Russians were dismissive of Musk’s desire to purchase their missiles. In fact, they generally made fun of him as just another foreigner with more money than sense. One engineer reportedly spat at Musk in disgust at what he perceived to be a man too rich for his own good trying to purchase such a perfectly designed weapon of war.

It took another two trips to Russia before they finally reached some semblance of a deal. Musk brought with him the $21 million they had agreed for the three ICBMs. And that’s when the Russians changed the deal, informing him that they actually meant $21 million apiece. Aware that he was being deliberately played, and not being taken seriously, Musk turned to Cantrell on the flight home and declared, ‘We can build a rocket ourselves.’ Cantrell urged him to do exactly that.

And so Musk did what he does so well. He read. The man nicknamed ‘Encyclopaedia’ by his family buried himself in every bit of literature he could find about rockets, from dusty technical manuals dating back to the old Soviet Union to the latest research. Cantrell pointed him in the direction of books such as Rocket Propulsion Elements, Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and The International Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems. Light reading for rocket enthusiasts.

Musk read everything he could get his hands on. And when he was done, he was confident that he understood rocketry as well as the engineers themselves. In fact, it was said he could more than hold his own in discussions with rocket engineers. There was no doubt that Musk knew every single element of the rockets he was going to have other people build for him.

Musk had refocused his mind from the world of the Internet to the world of aerospace. He began to meet with aerospace engineers in Los Angeles. He drove out to the Mojave Desert to join the Reaction Research Society, one of Southern California’s most famous experimental rocket clubs (founded in 1946), at their amateur launches. He attended meetings of Mars societies and clubs. If somebody was meeting in a room or hotel bar in Los Angeles to discuss space, it’s a good bet that Musk was there with them. Many described the intensity of his new interest as quite startling. Others said that watching rocket launches was like a religious experience for Musk. And still others, many of them long-time industry insiders, were offended and insulted by the arrogance of his newfound knowledge. There was indeed a hint of the kid who was too smart for his own good.

Musk began cold-calling notable aerospace engineers and some of the most brilliant minds in rocket science, and telling them of his plans to start his own rocket company. Many of them thought he was mad. But slowly he gathered disciples, notably Tom Mueller, described as a rising star in the building of rocket engines. Mueller shared Musk’s optimism about space. He also shared the negativity around his own ambitions. When Musk had told his parents he was leaving South Africa for Canada, Errol had said he’d be back in three months. Similarly, when Mueller told his family he was going to ‘build rockets’ and find a job in the aerospace industry, his father also said he’d be back and that ‘the forests would be waiting for him’ in his Idaho hometown.

Musk and Mueller first met through the Reaction Research Society. Musk had a variety of engineering questions for Mueller, as well as one profoundly important question. Cost? How cheaply could he build a rocket?

As Musk generated momentum on his plans, those closest to him did their best to convince him he was embarking on a journey of insanity rather than ingenuity. Adeo Ressi in particular came with one of the most convincing arguments of all. It didn’t include a financial spreadsheet or talk of profit and loss. It was simply a carefully curated hour-long video of failed rocket launches, with the rockets blowing up spectacularly in the sky. Clearly, Ressi believed that if Musk saw how few rockets actually make it off the ground, it would convince his friend to end this futile endeavour.

It had the opposite effect. It actually strengthened Musk’s resolve to find a solution. In the same way he had looked at the financial services industry and been surprised at its lack of innovation, Musk looked at the space industry and was surprised to learn that NASA had no plans to send human beings to Mars – the one thing he thought was a blatantly obvious goal. He even logged on to NASA’s website and thought the fact that he couldn’t find any mention of such a plan was merely an administrative oversight: ‘I was trying to figure out why we had not made more progress since Apollo,’ Musk said in 2003.5

He was right. Since the glory days of the 1960s and the 1969 moon landing, to exciting names such as Apollo and Voyager and Viking, the American space programme had lost momentum. In terms of Mars in particular, Mariner 9 had reached the orbit of Mars in 1971, and Viking 1 landed on Mars in 1976. But little had been done since then. The American space programme seemed to have stagnated.

‘In the Sixties we went from not being able to put anybody into space to putting somebody on the moon and developing all the technology from scratch to do that. And yet in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties we’ve kind of gone sideways. We’re currently in a situation where we can’t even put a person into lower Earth orbit,’ Musk reasoned.6

In 2010, addressing a special Senate hearing into the future of American spaceflight, Neil Armstrong said: ‘If the leadership we have acquired through our investment is simply allowed to fade away, other nations will surely step in where we have faltered. I do not believe that this would be in our best interests.’7

A year after his address, the Space Shuttle – once the flagship vehicle of space exploration and the main means of transporting American astronauts to the ISS – was grounded for the last time. The reason was simple. It had just become too expensive to go into space. It cost NASA roughly $450 million every time the Space Shuttle launched. Nothing had been done to make space exploration cheaper. Many argue that the writing was on the wall after the 2003 Columbia disaster, when seven astronauts were killed as the shuttle broke up upon re-entry into Earth’s orbit. This was the second major Space Shuttle tragedy, following the 1986 Challenger disaster, and it led to the former paragon of American space exploration being mothballed for good.

Since 2011, NASA has been hitching rides with the Russians into space on their Soyuz rockets. And it’s an expensive ride, coming at roughly $86 million a seat.

Clearly, something had to be done that would not only reinvigorate the interest in space but also make it far less expensive to get there. Since Musk’s meeting with Mueller in the Mojave Desert, his mind had been working on how cheaply you could build rockets. It was a problem perfectly suited to his way of thinking. It was outlandish enough to pique his interest. It was disruptive enough for an industry deemed previously inaccessible to private companies. And, as his brother Kimbal observed, it was big enough. Space was big enough for the mind of Musk.

‘He’s a guy with unlimited ambition. His mind just needs to be constantly fulfilled. The problems that he takes on therefore need to become more and more complex over time in order to keep him interested,’ said Kimbal.8 Errol has also observed that he worries about the day his son becomes bored. Space clearly has the potential to hold Musk’s interest for years to come.

What confounded Musk was that there had been no visible progress in terms of space exploration, while other technology sectors had grown by leaps and bounds. ‘That just doesn’t gel with all of the other technology sectors out there,’ he argued. ‘The computer that you could have bought in the early Seventies would’ve filled a room and had less computing power than a cellphone. So just about every sector of technology has improved. Why has this not improved?’9

Musk believed that if you went back 40 years with a vision of the future, and told people of the things that were to come, they would more likely have been surprised by the slow progress made in space than by the fact that people in the future carried supercomputers (cellphones) in their pockets: ‘If you went back to 1969 when we landed on the moon, and asked the public what would the situation be in 2015, I think they would’ve imagined we’d have a base on the moon, a base on Mars, and be all over the solar system.’10

But it hadn’t happened.

‘So I started looking into that.’11

Believing it at first to be simply a funding issue, Musk came up with his Mars Oasis idea, a means of possibly drumming up public support for a privately funded robotic mission to Mars which in turn he hoped would reinvigorate the space debate and lead to greater funding for the industry.

Once again, the engineer showed a keener understanding of the mechanics of the human mind and people’s perceptions than the mechanics of rocketry when he explained why he believed Mars Oasis would achieve this result: ‘It would cost about $15 to $20 million. We would put a small robotic lander on the surface of Mars with seeds and dehydrated nutrient gel that would hydrate upon landing and you would have plants growing in Martian radiation gravity conditions. And you’d also be maintaining a life support system on Mars. This would be interesting to the public because they tend to respond to precedents and superlatives,’ Musk said.12

‘This would be the furthest that life has ever travelled.’13

And, he added, there would of course be the money shot – the photo of green plants on a red Martian background.

And that’s exciting.

Musk realised that being Columbus and talking about discovering a new trade route is one thing, but there also needs to be talk of strange tribes and sea monsters to really get people interested and excited. It was science fiction and superheroes that had excited a young Pretoria boy’s mind.

And this childhood excitement is at the very heart of so much of what Musk has done. Space is no different. Frankly, it’s right there on the SpaceX website, under ‘Mission’. In bold letters above a photo of the Earth, Musk tells us: ‘You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great – and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.’14

Expanding on this, Musk said in 2017: ‘The part that I find personally most motivating is that it creates a sense of adventure and it makes people excited about the future. If you consider two futures – one where we are forever confined to Earth until eventually something terrible happens, or another future where we are out there on many planets, maybe even going beyond the solar system, I think that second version is incredibly inspiring and exciting. There need to be reasons to get up in the morning. Life can’t just be about solving problems, otherwise what’s the point. There have got to be things that people find inspiring and that make life worth living.’15

Even Richard Branson, a man who built his fortune on marketing a vision to people, admitted in Time magazine in 2013: ‘For a while now, space has been looking boring. News about space was reduced to budget cuts and deorbiting schedules, not research or innovation.’16

Musk realised that the narrative needed to change. The general public were quite rightly asking questions about what they believed to be the pointlessness of space exploration. Could that exorbitant cost not be put to better use right here on Earth? Why try and go to Mars when we cannot even feed or educate everybody on Earth properly? Shouldn’t we first try to sort out problems here, such as world hunger, before we try and colonise another planet? For many, Musk and Branson and Bezos fit the mould of eccentric billionaires fuelling their egos with dreams of the final frontier. In The Guardian newspaper in May 2020, columnist Arwa Mahdawi declared: ‘Of course billionaires like Elon Musk love outer space. The Earth is too small for their egos.’

‘There are some people who find billionaires with big rockets very inspirational … Hope for whom, I want to know? The World Bank estimates that between 40 and 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty (earning less than $1.90 a day) in 2020, thanks to COVID-19. What hope, exactly, does a rocket blasting into space provide when you can’t put food on your plate?

‘Seriously, if you think that billionaires are exploring space for the good of humankind then I have a bridge on Mars I can sell you. They are doing it for their ego and the commercial opportunity. They are doing it because they think they, quite literally, are the masters of the universe.’17

The topic of space exploration is fiercely debated everywhere from government offices and corporate boardrooms to podcasts such as Metaphysical Milkshake,18 cohosted by Rainn Wilson and Reza Aslan. Metaphysical Milkshake devoted an hour-long episode to debating the question, ‘Should we colonise Mars?’ They called in Dr Moogega Cooper, an astronomer who is also a planetary protection engineer for NASA, focusing specifically on Mars. Dr Cooper graduated from high school at the age of 16, one year younger than Musk. She describes herself as one of the ‘modern-day real life Guardians of the Galaxy’. Essentially, Dr Cooper makes sure that the spacecraft we’re sending to other planets are ‘clean enough’ so as not to adversely affect the ecosystems of other planets with pollutants from Earth.

The American astronomer Carl Sagan once summed up mankind’s ancient obsession with Mars – from the Greeks and Mayans to Musk – as follows: ‘Maybe we’re on Mars because of the magnificent science that can be done there – the gates of the wonder world are opening in our time. Maybe we’re on Mars because we have to be, because there’s a deep nomadic impulse built into us by the evolutionary process – we come, after all, from hunter-gatherers, and for 99.9 per cent of our tenure on Earth we’ve been wanderers. And the next place to wander to is Mars.’19

In the podcast, Dr Cooper adds: ‘It sparks the whole ethical side about how to responsibly wander to other places.’20 But she goes on to say that the idea of colonising Mars, while important in the sense that it can stimulate a lot of innovative thought, is just not feasible in even the next 30 years. Apparently, Earth is still a pretty good place for humans to exist, and it is still the only place for our extremely sensitive bodies. Dr Cooper cites numerous studies showing the changes that occur in human physiology after time in space, ‘and not all of them are good’.

According to Dr Cooper, humans could survive on Mars for a short time, but we certainly won’t be thriving there: ‘It’s not easy to build a habitat, to survive Mars’s high radiation and low temperature environments, and you’re being constantly bombarded by all of the UV – it’s not pleasant.’21 Quite simply, Dr Cooper believes Mars will never be a viable second Earth, and that the focus should remain on ‘protecting our own blue marble’.

Leave Mars to the Martians is another view of the debate.

Even Carl Sagan posed the question, ‘There will be a time when Mars is all explored; a time after robot aircraft have mapped it from aloft, a time after rovers have combed the surface, a time after samples have been returned safely to Earth, a time after human beings have walked the sands of Mars. What then? What shall we do with Mars? There are so many examples of human misuse of the Earth that even phrasing this question chills me. If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes. The existence of an independent biology on a nearby planet is a treasure beyond assessing, and the preservation of that life must, I think, supersede any other possible use of Mars.’22

Make no mistake, if there is money to made off of Mars, even the Red Planet will be exploited. Musk has admitted that ‘If we decide to establish a self-sustaining base on the moon or a base on Mars, that is enormous opportunity on the trillion-dollar level because then you’ve got basically interplanetary commerce going on. That’s pretty huge.’23 Clearly, financial reward in space is on the agenda in the next few light years.

But Musk has also defended space exploration in more philosophical ways. On 13 July 2021 he tweeted: ‘Those who attack space maybe don’t realize that space represents hope for so many people.’24

Back in the early 2000s, Musk could see that the narrative around space needed to change. Society needed to talk about space as exciting again, and people had to be shown the value of exploration for human advancement. Margaret Mead, the American anthropologist who died a year before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, said: ‘Once you raise the question that other lands than this Earth are possible to live on, that other places are possible places to found colonies, or that there may be other living creatures somewhere, you have changed the whole place of man in the universe. You’ve altered everything. This involves a considerable reduction of human arrogance and a tremendous magnification of human possibilities.’25

For Musk, the initial desire was not to start his own space exploration company as much as it was to restart the conversation around space exploration. ‘Is there some way to reignite the dream of Apollo?’ he asked. ‘Apollo was incredibly inspiring to everyone around the world. Only a very tiny number of people went there, but vicariously we all went there. I think that’s true of if we have a Mars base as well.’26

This raised another question in Musk’s mind as to why space exploration had stagnated: ‘Is it a question of we’ve lost the will to explore?’27 Initially, he thought this was indeed the case. But later Musk says he came to realise that people had not lost the will to explore space. They just couldn’t see a way. Most significantly, they couldn’t see an affordable way. We needed to make space cheaper.

And even Musk admitted the colossal challenge involved here when he said during a lecture at Stanford in 2003: ‘Space is advanced entrepreneuring. Space is a tough one for first-time entrepreneurs. You’re better off starting with something that requires low capital, and space is a high capital effort.’28

But the challenge was perfectly suited to Musk. As Justine observed, Musk is a man capable of moving between the tribes. An engineer in a suit. And the challenge of space would require both of these qualities in astounding measures of genius and boldness.
