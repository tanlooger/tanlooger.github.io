title: Falcon 1

BEFORE Falcon 1 could fly, it needed a booster.

Musk’s brief to Tom Mueller was simple: build a lightweight, efficient rocket engine that could produce the 70 000 pounds of thrust required to get a small satellite into orbit. But also, build a rocket engine that could handle temperatures of 3 371ºC within its combustion chamber without melting everything around it. And also remember to build a rocket engine that could handle the complex relationship between vast amounts of fuel – a combination of liquid oxygen and kerosene – burning at insane temperatures and at a furious rate of combustion. Finally, remember that rockets are extremely thirsty, and while you need plenty of fuel to haul a chunk of steel into space, this makes the rocket heavy. It cannot be too heavy. Off you go, Tom.

Astrophysicist Paul M Sutter, the chief scientist at the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, and the host of Ask a Spaceman and Space Radio, explains exactly why rockets are so complex to build, and why Mueller’s task was by no means an easy one. According to Sutter, everything in rocketry revolves around what is known as the ‘rocket equation’: ‘This is a simple relationship between the energy needed to reach your destination, the energy available in the fuel and the fraction of the total rocket mass used up by fuel. If you want to go farther or heave a heavier object to orbit, you need more fuel. But more fuel adds more weight, making it much harder than you expect to get a lift. It’s this “tyranny” that explains why modern rockets are in the range of 80 to 90 per cent fuel, all used to heft a comparatively small payload into space, and why staging – having multiple rocket stages used during launch – is such an important concept: by ditching dried-up rocket parts as you go, you become that much more efficient.’1

While the principle behind rocket engines is fairly simple, the building of them entails some of the most complex engineering known to humankind. According to NASA, humans have been making rockets – albeit in mostly primitive form – for around 2 000 years. But it’s only been in the last 100 years or so that rocketry has developed to the extent of enabling space exploration.

So why has the basic design remain largely unchanged for the past 100 years?

According to Sutter, ‘It turns out that 100 years ago we found a very potent combination. We found a very powerful way to efficiently and cheaply drive rockets that we basically haven’t figured out how to beat.’2

That ‘potent’ combination is combining your energy source with your propellant so that they do one and the same thing. The fuel that burns up in the rocket is also, by engine design, the propellant that drives it outward from Earth and into space.

‘You have a source of energy or propellant that you carry with you in your rocket and you mix them at precisely the right time to achieve thrust,’ says Sutter.3

And all rocket design follows this same basic principle. But, as with Musk’s brief to Mueller, simply adding more fuel to haul bigger payloads into space doesn’t work.

Sutter states outright that he is not in the same league as the brilliant minds who design and build rockets. But he is a physicist and the physics of rocketry is something he can comment on. ‘This is what’s called the tyranny of the rocket equation,’ he says. ‘If you add more fuel you’re adding more weight, which means it’s more expensive. This can limit what you can send to orbit. This is why getting stuff to orbit is so expensive.’4

So it’s hardly surprising that as brilliant as Mueller was, not even his closest friends believed he and a private company could build such an engine.

But he did.

The result was the Merlin family of engines. First came the Merlin 1A, evolving through the Merlin 1B, 1C and 1D between 2003 and 2012. The name was Mueller’s choice, a liberty given him by Musk. Musk had named the rocket Falcon, and gave Mueller the honour of naming the engine – on condition that he give it an actual name and not a series of numbers like a serial code. Taking his lead from the Falcon engine, and on the advice of a colleague who was a falconer, Mueller opted for Merlin – the name of a medium-sized falcon.

Merlin was what drove the launch of Falcon 1, and has been behind SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

And Mueller is perfectly placed to explain to the average person how it all works. With a simple green pen sketch on a whiteboard, and speaking softly and methodically, Mueller describes the inner workings of Merlin: ‘The combustion chamber is what generates the thrust of the engine. At the top of this sits an injector, which injects the propellants into the combustion chamber. These burn to produce the combustion that results in the thrust.

‘The combustion chamber operates at 1 000 psi (pounds per square inch) of pressure. It draws its fuel from tanks sitting alongside the rocket. In one tank is liquid oxygen (LOx) and the other fuel (Rocket Propellant 1). Each tank is at 50 psi.

‘What takes the 50 psi in the tanks and turns it into 1 000 psi in the chamber is a turbopump. The turbopump is basically two back-to-back impellers on a single shaft. The LOx comes in at 50 psi and goes out at 1 400 psi. The fuel does the same, except it flows in through channels inside the chamber and at the same time acts like a radiator in a car cooling the chamber. The fuel comes out at 1 500 psi.

‘A turbine generates the horsepower to drive the two impeller pumps. A gas generator powers the turbine. We burn at high pressure inside the chamber and hot gases come out of the throat of the engine and out the nozzle to generate the thrust that lifts the rocket. That is 110 000 pounds force of thrust. It all results in roughly 350 pounds mass per second. Nine of these Merlins are used on Falcon 9 (hence the name) first stage. They burn for just under three minutes. In that time they consume just over half a million pounds of propellant. It’s a pretty thirsty device here to get into orbit,’ says Mueller.5

And that, in a nutshell, is what Musk and Mueller and SpaceX and all the brilliant minds have tried to build, refine and improve upon.

Merlin is where it all began for SpaceX.

‘This is a world-class engine. This is very easy to make, very low-cost and extremely reliable,’ Mueller says.6

The company has since designed several liquid-propellant rocket engines, including the Merlin family, Kestrel (named after the smallest falcons), Draco and SuperDraco. Its most recent engine, Raptor, is the most powerful rocket engine ever produced.

But it’s important to appreciate the engineering leaps Musk and SpaceX made to get to the first version of Merlin, then to its various iterations, and finally to Raptor, which is the engine Musk wants to get him to Mars as part of his Starship project to start a human settlement there.

It took only three years for SpaceX to build and test its first rocket engine. And the company surged forward from there, going from the liquid-propellant Merlin engines to the latest methane-fuelled, full-flow, staged-combustion-cycle Raptor. The option for methane with Raptor was made with Mars in mind, as it is a gas that can be produced on Mars.

Again, the leap in technology is significant. From the Merlin 1 to the Raptor, SpaceX has more than doubled the thrust of its engines and currently holds the world record for the highest combustion chamber pressure ever reached of 330 bar, surpassing the previous record of 300 bar achieved by the Russian RD-701 engine. This development came in less than 15 years.7

As an indication of just how impressive a feat this was, you need only turn to Musk’s chief competition – fellow billionaire and rocket builder Jeff Bezos. During a tour of his factory in 2016, Bezos, hardly short of money or confidence, told reporters it takes six years to build a rocket engine. Musk’s philosophy for his fledgling SpaceX team was clearly embraced. Eric Berger, author of Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days that Launched SpaceX, described it as a philosophy of ‘move fast, build things, and break things’.8

In 2008, Falcon 1 became the first privately funded liquid-fuelled rocket to reach orbit. And Musk has moved fast ever since. In 2012, Dragon (a spacecraft capable of carrying up to seven people or cargo into space) became the first private cargo-carrying spacecraft to reach the ISS. In 2015, Falcon 9 delivered 11 communications satellites into orbit. And then it completed what in Musk’s mind has been the next evolutionary phase in rocketry – reusability.

It’s probably not too far off to suggest that if the past 100 years of rocketry could be likened to the development of early hominids, this specific moment in December 2015 was when rocketry reached the equivalent of walking upright. The Falcon 9 first stage returned to Earth and landed – upright – in what was the first-ever orbital-class rocket landing. According to Musk, it made no financial sense to keep spending millions on one-time rockets when you should rather be figuring out a way to make them reusable. The Falcon had truly landed. In more ways than one. Suddenly, the three countries – the US, Russia and China – at the forefront of rocketry were all focused on one man and the advancements his fledgling company was making.

In 2018, Falcon Heavy – the world’s most powerful operational rocket, which the company says is able of supporting missions to the moon and Mars – successfully blasted off into space. In 2019, Dragon became the first American spacecraft to autonomously dock with the ISS. And on 30 May 2020 came the coup de grâce: Dragon transported human beings to and from the ISS.

Musk has achieved all of this by creating his very own version of the rocket equation. Until recently, cost was not a priority for rocket builders because they were funded by governments. Their only focus was on making the biggest and most powerful rockets they could. It didn’t matter that they burned through billions of dollars as quickly as their rockets burned through fuel.

But Musk made cost his main focus. And that is his greatest competitive edge over Bezos and every other private and government space company out there. Where NASA has spent roughly $152 million per launch, Musk has said that SpaceX will reach a point where it can launch both people and cargo into space at 1.3 per cent of that cost. Falcon 9 currently costs $62 million to launch, which is not quite where his target is, but it’s getting there. In 2020, SpaceX announced that it was looking at a launch price tag of $30 million. Ultimately, Musk has said he foresees a Starship launch at a cost of $2 million. It sounds ludicrous, even when his own company declares that $10 million might be more realistic. And Musk has even managed to get his launches insured for less as well, in the range of $2.5 million compared with the roughly $7 million of his competitors.

Launch contracts are what keep a space company afloat. The cheaper you make those launch contracts, the more business you get. SpaceX is a prime example of Musk’s alternative thinking. Back in the early 1990s with Zip2, Musk didn’t build the Internet; he simply found a way to use it better. With PayPal, he didn’t redesign money; he simply redesigned how it is used. And with SpaceX, Musk’s goal was not necessarily just to get into space; it was to make getting into space cheaper. To achieve this, he redesigned the supply chain. Musk and his engineers have also ensured commonality of design so that there is very little difference between the rockets and their engines, further saving on development costs.

Falcon Heavy is a perfect example of the strides Musk and SpaceX have made in moving rocket engineering forward. The largest rocket ever built was NASA’s Saturn V, used between 1967 and 1973 during the Apollo programme. It stands 363 ft (110 m) high. Falcon Heavy is 224 ft (64 m) high. Saturn V produces 34.5 million newtons of thrust. Falcon Heavy comes in at 934 000 newtons. But here comes the vital key differentiator. Saturn V weighs 6.2 million pounds. And in the other corner, fresh out of a Silicon Valley mind, comes Falcon Heavy at a lean 140 660 pounds. Most significantly, of Saturn V’s 6.2 million pounds, 5.5 million was fuel. Saturn V is a prisoner of the tyranny of the rocket equation. Falcon Heavy is recalibrating the rocket equation. And SpaceX is writing its own rocket equation.



SPACEX has also revealed one other key element about Musk. Does Elon Musk view himself as South African or American?

Musk rarely speaks of South Africa and is only identified as South African in his many bios or the articles written about him. And it’s probably safe to say that his role in reigniting the space race has shown that he feels a greater kinship with the US than with South Africa.

The success of Dragon has been described on the SpaceX website as having ‘restored human spaceflight to the United States’. For Musk, the US is back in the driving seat of spaceflight. Any doubt that this is where his mind is at can be seen in his response to a comment from Russia.

In explaining his desire to make space exploration more accessible and to lower the costs, Musk used the example of American astronauts previously hitching rides to the ISS on Russian rockets at exorbitant cost, and pointed out that this was not a good outcome for the Americans. The fact that he personally felt a sense of patriotic embarrassment at this perhaps suggests where Musk’s heart really lies. He has repeatedly said he would not have been able to achieve what he has achieved anywhere else but in the US.

In 2014, Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin taunted the US by suggesting that its lack of means to deliver astronauts to the ISS meant it might as well consider using a trampoline, Musk clearly took the jibe to heart. He remembered it. And he waited six years to respond.

In 2020, when Dragon delivered the first US astronauts from American soil since 2011, Musk hit back. ‘The trampoline is working,’9 he said in the resultant press conference, calling it ‘an inside joke’. It hit the target with devastating effect. Rogozin congratulated Musk on the achievement, but he was clearly infuriated by Musk’s retort. In a column for the Russian edition of Forbes, Rogozin showed just how close to the mark Musk’s comments had hit when he said, ‘Our country was the first to send a man into space. We remain first to this day.’10 It seemed an almost petulant response.

Finally, a clear indication of Musk’s allegiance to his adopted country came in his response to a tweet from President Donald Trump. On 6 February 2018, Trump tweeted: ‘Congratulations to @ElonMusk and @Spacex on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement, along with @NASA’s commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best.’ Musk’s response was not, as is popularly believed, the following tweet: ‘I’m from South Africa, you dumbass.’ That tweet was a hoax that went viral. Musk’s real response was perhaps far more revealing of his heart: ‘Thank you on behalf of @SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!’

The rapid rise of SpaceX was certainly not without its challenges and failures. In fact, Musk believed it would fail right from the start. ‘I thought that the most likely outcome was failure,’11 he said of his decision to embark on the SpaceX journey.

Merely securing a launch site proved a significant challenge on its own. The paperwork and red tape involved make up the black hole down which all dreams disappear. ‘The space industry is a very complicated regulatory structure,’12 says Musk of his early frustrations. ‘When somebody tries to build an orbital launch vehicle that is not all that distinguishable from an ICBM, there’s a lot of regulation. There probably should be. You don’t want to launch something and end up hitting LA. The regulatory stuff was very difficult. The environmental approvals were difficult. Much more so than we expected. In Silicon Valley, you live in a libertarian paradise with almost no regulation. What can be very frustrating is that regulation is often irrational. It doesn’t make any sense. But you’ve got somebody there who is simply executing a set of rules, independent of whether those rules makes sense. You can try to convince them that the rules don’t make sense, and they won’t listen to you. Regulation is the most annoying thing. There are some restrictions which are really annoying. We are not allowed to employ anyone who doesn’t have permanent residence in the United States. Basically, if they can’t throw you in jail, they won’t let you work on rocket stuff. If we talk to any foreign nationals, we need a technology transfer agreement from the State Department.’13

Initially, they managed to gain access to military test and launch sites in the United States. But having to wait in line for military or government launches to go first was too costly for the fledgling company. ‘The resources were draining out of the company. Effectively, it was like being starved,’ Musk told Berger in Liftoff.14

And so developed a bizarre adventurous period in SpaceX’s history that feels like something of a cross between Star Wars and Survivor. Musk moved the entire operation to Kwajalein Atoll, in the Marshall Islands – about 10 000 km from the United States mainland – the site of a large missile defence and test site run by the US Army. The military had agreed to work with Musk and offered SpaceX a launch site on tiny Omelek Island. It was like something out of a war movie, or as Musk recalls when he flew over the islands in a helicopter, straight out of a scene in Apocalypse Now.

Kwajalein, the world’s largest coral atoll, consists of 93 islands and islets. During World War II the islands formed an integral part of Japan’s perimeter defence, and were the scene of the Battle of Kwajalein in January and February 1944. The relatively swift American success here proved decisive in the ‘island hopping’ strategy of breaching Japan’s defensive perimeter. The Battle of Kwajalein punched a hole straight through the Japanese barrier; perhaps it could help Musk punch a hole through the red tape of space exploration. After the war, the US military used the atoll for nuclear weapons testing.

Having agreed a deal to make Omelek a launch site, the small team of SpaceX engineers worked hard to build two launchpads and a rocket in three and a half years. They quite literally poured the concrete for the launch site. It was a classic example of the Musk philosophy that anything is possible. The team worked in jungle-like conditions, slept in rudimentary military quarters and ate in a military canteen. They were more like a tribe than a company. The engineers wore T-shirts they’d designed themselves, which declared their motto in terms of the competition: ‘Outsweat. Outdrink. Outlaunch.’15 The tradition was that any new SpaceX employee on ‘Kwaj’, as it became known to the team, who managed to survive the first night would earn a T-shirt.

But as for reaching orbit, SpaceX hadn’t yet got that T-shirt itself.

The first three launches of Falcon 1 failed.

The first took place on 24 March 2006 at 22:30. Years of hard work were condensed into the roughly 30 seconds that Falcon 1 took to rise above the island and soar into the sky before the Merlin engine malfunctioned and it came crashing down to earth again. In the time it takes to quickly check your email, years of hard work, hope and expectation went up in flames.

The second launch took place on 21 March 2007 at 01:10.

With the familiar count of ‘Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!’ Falcon 1 rose above the island again. Droplets of water could be seen forming on the screen of the onboard video camera as it rose through the clouds, with the island growing smaller and smaller below it. After two minutes and 52 seconds the ground crew watched a successful stage separation of the rocket on their video screens, and gave a small cheer. At three minutes and 117 km they confirmed the second-stage engine ignition. Everything was going according to plan. Ice particles could be seen forming on the video camera’s window, and in the background, the familiar blue curve of Earth. And then, in what was described as an ‘upper stage control anomaly’, Falcon 1 began spiralling. It had reached space, but it hadn’t managed to achieve a stable orbit.

The third launch took place on 3 August 2008 at 03:34. The liftoff was perfect but the rocket failed to reach orbit when the second-stage separation was unsuccessful. ‘Three failures is a lot of failures,’ SpaceX operations manager Anne Chinnery told Berger in Liftoff. ‘Hardly anyone survives that in the aerospace world.’16

The fourth launch took place on 28 September 2008 at 23:15. It was flawless. At 2:37 minutes and 18 seconds, a successful stage separation took place. ‘Stage separation confirmed,’ said a woman’s voice, and there was cheering in the background. As the rocket continued to soar away from Earth, the hopes of those on Omelek Island were soaring with it. The words on the launch sheet read ‘SUCCESS’. The irony is that Musk had decided on the fourth launch as purely a demonstration. As Berger recounts, even the payload was a demonstration. Officially, it is listed as RatSat – formed from the first letters of the surnames of SpaceX employees Jeff Richichi, Ray Amador and Chris Thompson.

After the third failed launch, the SpaceX team had to salvage and rebuild a Falcon 1 that was in pieces. And as with all things Musk and SpaceX, they were given almost no time to do it – one month.

Their first challenge was getting the rebuilt rocket from California back to Omelek Island. You don’t just book a seat on the next flight for a rocket, and the waiting time for shipment by sea would cripple a now very wobbly SpaceX. ‘We were running on fumes at that point. We had virtually no money. A fourth failure would have been absolutely game over. Done,’ said Musk.17 The US Air Force came to the rescue when they agreed to let the Falcon 1 hitch a ride on one of their C-17 transport aircraft.

But it was as if everything about this last launch would test Musk to the absolute limit. During the flight from California the rocket literally crumpled as a result of changes in air pressure inside the C-17. The onboard crew had to open up the rocket to prevent further crumpling, and the pilots had to take the aircraft up to a more stable pressure level. They managed to prevent further damage, but enough had been done by the time they unloaded the rocket at Omelek Island. With Musk confirming that SpaceX could not wait longer than a month for a successful launch, technicians managed in a week to repair what should have taken six weeks to do. And they rolled the rocket onto the launchpad in time for its 28 September 2008 launch, which Musk watched from a monitor back in California. He described it as one of the greatest days of his life.

It was the last Hail Mary that actually worked. And everybody knew what it meant to Musk.

Musk had shown himself to be more than just a billionaire with more bravado than brains when, in a memo to his deflated team after the failed launches, he wrote, ‘Having experienced first-hand how hard it is to reach orbit, I have a lot of respect for those that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays of space launch today. SpaceX is in this for the long haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.’18

But even with this successful launch, on Earth Musk was facing a world of problems. He was out of money, having sunk his entire fortune into SpaceX and two other ventures: the electric car maker Tesla and SolarCity, which sold and installed solar energy generation systems, primarily rooftop solar panels.

He was out of love, having divorced Justine and handed over his house in the process. He was out of time, having failed to secure the necessary investment capital before the global financial crisis hit.

And, for the first time in his life, Elon Musk was very close to being out of his mind.
