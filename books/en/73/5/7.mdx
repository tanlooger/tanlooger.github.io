title: The Space Barons

ON Wednesday 15 September 2021, our relationship with outer space changed forever.

Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft carried four civilians into orbit for the first time in human history. These were not professional astronauts, and this was not just cargo. These were four ordinary people – who went into space.

This was a seminal moment for humanity, and for Musk.

Four civilians went into space alone. Humanity’s previous interactions with space, from the first Earth orbits to the moon landings and the ISS, were indeed awe-inspiring. But on all of these occasions, the ordinary person was merely an observer. We watched in awe as professionals did what we could only dream of – that giant leap taken on our behalf.

And the giant leap taken by the crew of Inspiration4 was an equally defining one for Musk’s space ambitions.

Musk has said all along that his driving ambition is to make humans a multiplanetary species. His reasons for this are both practical, to prevent a single extinction event similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, and emotional, to make science fiction real and create the exciting future that has captivated him since he was a child.

To do this, he believed he first needed to reignite the conversation around space exploration and get people excited about the subject again. The next steps would be to build a private space company and make it financially viable by securing government contracts first to transport cargo and then to transport astronauts.

All of this Musk achieved with SpaceX.

Wednesday 15 September 2021 was a landmark. In a way, it was the day when the world of The Jetsons – an American animated series of the 1960s featuring a futuristic family living a space-age life – became a reality. Ordinary people could look to the stars and dream of a day when they could experience spaceflight without having to become professional astronauts.

It did, however, take a billionaire to book the seats on this historic first flight. Just as it was once the well-off who were able to book seats on the first commercial airliners, or to own mobile phones, and now everybody can fly and everybody has a mobile phone. It’s that kind of trajectory that Musk likes to set his sights on. He was one of the first Internet billionaires at a time when the new technology was only really understood by a niche group of highly intelligent individuals. Now, five-year-olds understand the Internet and hold it in the palm of their hands.

For Musk, the speed with which you can close the gap between being the first and opening it up to everybody is where the thrill of engineering lies: get the conversation going, whether it be the Internet, electric cars or spaceflight, and then move fast. In doing so, you ensure the industry and the entire narrative move a lot faster than they would have if the grand vision had not been revealed. It is for this reason that Musk has declared he doesn’t register patents. On two separate occasions, he has said Tesla patents would be open-source. ‘If somebody comes and makes a better electric car than Tesla and it’s so much better than ours that we can’t sell our cars and we go bankrupt, I still think that’s a good thing for the world.1

The overarching goal of Tesla is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And so if we created a patent portfolio that discouraged other companies from making electric cars, that would be inconsistent with our mission.’2

And yet with Musk, there is always a carefully thought-out strategy that his followers sometimes don’t see. Musk announced Tesla’s patent strategy shortly before Toyota ended its collaboration with Tesla in 2017 – reportedly over a clash between Tesla’s risk-taking approach and the more conservative approach of Toyota – and announced its own hydrogen vehicle. By opening Tesla’s patents, a move that Toyota mimicked with the patents for its hydrogen vehicle, the idea was indeed to accelerate the move to a sustainable energy vehicle. Musk, though, was tipping the scales in his favour, or rather in favour of electric vehicles over any other competing technology. With open patents, more developers could support and grow Tesla’s current technology, which in turn would keep Tesla in the driving seat of the move to sustainable-energy vehicles and wouldn’t shift the development focus to another source of energy, such as hydrogen. It’s a subtle shift, but one that clearly shows how Musk’s mind works. As altruistic as his ambitions are, Musk still works very much at the sharp end of what makes business sense.

So it’s safe to say there will be a commercial benefit for SpaceX beyond just protecting human consciousness, and clearly there needs to be a return in order for the company to survive.

But the four-person crew of Inspiration4 were not concerned with such matters. The crew was led by technology billionaire Jared Isaacman, who paid around $200 million for the privilege of being mission commander. A qualified pilot, Isaacman has vast experience in flying everything from small aircraft to fighter jets. Draken International, one of his companies, provides flight training services to the US Department of Defense. Like Musk, Isaacman never much enjoyed school and found a life in technology and adventure. But he has also displayed a keen understanding of privilege, and has used many of his flying experiences to help raise funds for charity.

In Isaacman, Musk certainly had the right ambassador for Inspiration4. In a special Netflix documentary about the mission, Isaacman reflected: ‘What thoughts do I think people could potentially have on this? Well, it’s a billionaire going on a joyride. The privileges of wealth to be able to go and disregard all that could be done here on Earth. For me, there has to be some offset. We are not going to do this if we can’t make a huge difference for the problems the world’s faced with today, or we don’t earn the right to go up into space.

‘You definitely don’t get into my position in life unless a couple of things went your way at the right time. And then you think about the extreme other end of the spectrum which is the families where nothing went right, they got dealt a horrible hand in life, and a lot of these kids [suffering from cancer] don’t even grow up and have a chance to experience even one hundredth of what I’ve had the opportunity to experience, and it’s an imbalance that sucks and it’s terrible and we should do something about it … If we are going to eventually live in a world where everybody is capable of going out and journeying amongst the stars then we better fight childhood cancer along the way.’3

It was decided that St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, in Memphis, Tennessee, would be the official beneficiary of the Inspiration4 mission. St Jude, founded in 1962 by beloved entertainer Danny Thomas, is a world leader in childhood cancer research, particularly leukaemia. The aim was to raise $200 million for the hospital.

With this in mind, Isaacman offered two of the remaining three seats to St Jude. The hospital selected Hayley Arceneaux, a staff member who is herself a cancer survivor and had been treated at St Jude. She went on to qualify as a physician’s assistant and returned to the hospital to work with leukaemia and lymphoma patients.

St Jude opted to raffle the second seat, which eventually went to Christopher Sembroski, a US Air Force veteran with a background in the aerospace industry. Ironically, as a college student, he had volunteered with a company named ProSpace that lobbied government to open up space travel and pave the way for companies such as SpaceX.

Isaacman decided to offer up the fourth seat in the form of a contest. The person who came up with the best business idea for an online shop incorporating the ecommerce services of his company, Shift4 Payments, and the online store Shift4Shop, would win the final seat on Inspiration4. That honour went to Dr Sian Proctor, a geoscientist whose father had worked for NASA during the Apollo missions. She also shares Musk’s vision of opening up space to all. As an artist and poet, she promotes what she calls ‘JEDI Space’ – Just, Equitable, Diverse and Inclusive – for all humanity as part of her Space2inspire initiative. She used the Shift4Shop to sell her artwork.

These four individuals represented a keen balance between privilege and pioneering, but Isaacman took this a step further. For the four seats he had purchased, he assigned each a symbolic trait. As mission commander, his seat symbolised leadership. The other traits were generosity, prosperity and hope. Arceneaux sat neatly in the hope seat, while Sembroski filled the generosity seat and Proctor took the prosperity seat.

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket did the heavy lifting, and the Dragon – the first privately owned spacecraft to transport astronauts to the ISS – spent three days in lower Earth orbit with its first all-civilian crew. They drifted at an orbital altitude of 585 km, which was the fifth-highest human orbital altitude in history. It was even higher than the ISS, which orbits the Earth at an altitude of 408 km.

Suddenly, a billionaire, a physician’s assistant, an air force veteran and an entrepreneurial scientist were alone in orbit. For Musk, this was the critical moment in terms of getting the public excited about space again. This was now far beyond the nuts and bolts of sending rockets into space, winning CRS contracts, launching government satellites or even sending professional astronauts into space. This was science fiction made real. Where going into space was once seen as a question of national duty, it was now a personal bucket-list experience.

Musk had moved ridiculously fast, from building his own rockets to developing reusable rockets to transporting space cargo to astronauts and sending civilians into space. A timeline of 12 years from when Falcon 1 became the first privately funded rocket to reach orbit in 2008 to this moment. When you consider that it took the US nine years – and an enormous national effort – to land a man on the moon, Musk’s 12 years is an incredible achievement. And he had done it as a private company. It was a giant leap that left his competitors, the so-called ‘Space Barons’, far behind.

The Billionaire Space Race, as it’s become known, revolves around three individuals: Elon Musk (SpaceX), Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Richard Branson (Virgin Galactic). Their combined net worth is a little more than the GDP of South Africa. But individually, they couldn’t be more different in their visions of space.

Branson was probably the first to tout the appeal of spaceflight for paying customers and not just astronauts. He has long harboured dreams of his own to travel into space. Branson’s vision appears more focused on space travel as a means of transport, with a vision of one day being able to fly people between cities and countries at a suborbital level, far faster than any commercial airline could.

Bezos wants to take this a step further. He has a vision of people travelling into space and living and working in spinning orbital space colonies. A moon base is also part of his grand vision, as is the plan to move much of Earth’s industry into space as a way of keeping the planet clean. And, of course, space tourism.

Musk has plans to go the furthest of all – to Mars. Space tourism is also on the agenda. But Musk’s ultimate aim is for humans not just to visit space but to live there. And he has targeted Mars as the ‘new Earth’.

Branson and Bezos have been determined to beat each other as the first Space Baron to actually go into space. Branson took the first shot, on 11 July 2021, when he flew his suborbital spaceplane VSS Unity (SpaceShipTwo class) to what is defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale as the agreed edge of space – the Kármán Line of 100 km altitude, or the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. Unity reached an altitude of 86 km during the trip. Although it can be argued that Branson’s craft did not quite reach space, as he did not cross the Kármán Line, both the US Air Force and NASA place the boundary of space at 80 km, which does give Branson the title of first Space Baron in space.

On 20 July 2021, Bezos made his trip into space in his New Shepard 2 rocket (named for Mercury astronaut Alan B Shepard). New Shepard touched into outer space at 105 km altitude, just a shade over the Kármán Line, giving him bragging rights as the first Space Baron in space. Bezos took with him 82-year-old Mary Wallace (Wally) Funk, who became the oldest person to travel into space, and 18-year-old Dutch pilot Oliver Daemen, who became the youngest. Bezos’s younger brother, Mark, also went along for the ride.

But in almost every sense, Musk is leading this three-way space race. SpaceX has transformed the rocket industry more than any other company. It has secured the necessary and highly lucrative contracts to fuel its expansion. And it is by far the most popular and perhaps most visible of the three in the minds of the general public – the result of Musk’s own popular persona as well as his highly visible failed launches. Musk has not yet publicly stated if and when he will travel into space himself, apart from joking that he would indeed like to die on Mars one day, ‘just not on impact’. On a more serious note, though, he has stated that his position at the helm of so many companies at present makes it too much of a risk for him to entertain space travel for now.

Yet while Branson and Musk appear happy to share in the dream of space, Bezos has been involved in court battles and public spats with both companies. Bezos’s Blue Origin was quick to point out that Branson had not crossed the Kármán Line, even producing a detailed explanatory graphic and describing Branson’s craft as a ‘high-altitude airplane’ rather than a rocket. Blue Origin has also taken repeated swipes at SpaceX, going so far as to declare its landing vehicles unsafe for astronauts. They were also at pains to point out that New Shepard 2 boasted ‘the largest windows in space’.

Then, on Wednesday 15 September, Musk blasted past them all. His Inspiration4 mission made history in every sense as the first all-civilian crew surged past the highest points reached by Branson and Bezos, and even the ISS, reaching an altitude of 585 km.

And the records tumbled.

As listed on the SpaceX website, it was the first all-civilian human spaceflight to orbit, with the first black female spacecraft pilot (Proctor) and the youngest American in space (the 29-year-old Arceneaux, who also became the first person with a prosthetic body part to go into space, having lost part of her left thigh and knee to cancer at the age of ten), and it was the longest human spaceflight since the Hubble missions – and several other firsts. In a nod to Bezos, Musk and his team pointed out that Dragon’s cupola provides a viewing area of over 2 000 square inches, making it the largest continuous window ever to go into space. And finally, the Inspiration4 mission raised close to $154 million for the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

But it’s between Musk and Bezos that the most intense battle and most heated exchanges have occurred. Up until now, SpaceX has led the way. It has won the necessary government and NASA contracts against Blue Origin, and it has secured the prized launch sites. Although formed two years after Blue Origin, SpaceX quickly eclipsed its rival. Musk’s ability to move at the speed of light has clearly been the differentiator, while Bezos is said to favour a more cautious approach. While Musk was printing ‘Occupy Mars’ T-shirts, Bezos encapsulated Blue Origin’s approach as gradatim ferociter (step by step – ferociously).

And Musk appears to be winning the PR war as well. As they’ve competed for everything from government contracts to public support, Musk has come out ahead. Bezos’s response has been to go to court. When NASA awarded the CRS contract to SpaceX, Blue Origin sued NASA on the grounds of ‘unlawful and improper evaluation of proposals submitted’.

In the mind of the public, Musk is a billionaire offering the hope of a brighter future in which he wants to save the planet, save humanity and make spaceflight accessible to all – not just the super-wealthy. Bezos, on the other hand, seems to be portrayed as a billionaire taking jaunts into space while his company is under intense scrutiny over its treatment of its employees. Dragging the space race into court and suing NASA – essentially the hand that feeds – is hardly doing his image any good.

Musk summed up the advantage he has over Bezos when he described the Inspiration4 mission: ‘We’re trying to make the dream of space accessible to anyone. This Inspiration4 mission helps bring awareness of spaceflight to a lot of people – makes it more personal. Hopefully as the name suggests, it inspires people about spaceflight.’4

Quite simply, Musk makes it personal and Musk inspires. Bezos does not.

The two have traded blows on Twitter, and at times it has appeared petty. But for all his flaws, for all his mistakes, for all the criticism of his business practices, the reality is that Musk resonates with people. The success of SpaceX and Tesla confirms this. He resonates so much that people are willing to overlook the negative in pursuit of his shared vision.

For both men, though, and any who follow, the risks are high.

On this scale, when things go wrong, the result is cataclysmic. Space travel remains a risky bet. Despite this, of the almost 600 people who have been into space, only 18 have lost their lives. And only three have actually died in space, namely, above the Kármán Line.

Accidents are bound to happen, but up to this point, the overwhelming majority of those who have given their lives in the pursuit of new horizons among the stars have been professional astronauts, often from the military, on government missions. Any loss of life remains tragic, but when professional astronauts lose their lives on government missions, it’s something people can perhaps deal with.

However, when civilians die, that penetrates an entirely new area of the public psyche. The Challenger disaster of 1986 is an example; of the seven crew members who perished when the Space Shuttle exploded just over a minute after launch, only one was a civilian. Christa McAuliffe, a teacher, had been selected to become the first American civilian to go into space.

Millions watched in shock as Challenger broke up. The tragedy rocked American society and the world. President Ronald Reagan declared a week of mourning. But it’s worth noting that the news reports that followed invariably mentioned that Christa McAuliffe was a schoolteacher. Everybody knew there was a schoolteacher on board.

The more space tourism becomes a reality, the higher the risk of tragedy involving ordinary citizens. Governments may well be able to absorb this impact, and the resulting backlash. But private companies are less able to do so.

Musk perhaps appreciates this more than most as a result of his experience with Tesla. In June 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened investigations into 30 collisions involving Tesla vehicles, which had led to ten fatalities since 2016. The NHTSA pointed to Tesla’s Autopilot system as ‘suspected of use’. The investigations were not exclusively focused on Tesla, and also examined vehicles from other car makers using driverless technology. But the spotlight still fell first on Tesla.

SpaceX, and any other private space entities, will certainly face similar scrutiny in order to ensure that the space race remains a safe race for all.
