MARTIN Eberhard was recently divorced and in the market for a sports car. But his Silicon Valley background, his training in electrical engineering and a general awareness of and interest in global warming and sustainability saw his interest drift away from the traditional sports cars and more towards electric vehicles.

But first Eberhard wanted to ascertain whether the cost of owning an electric car was actually worth it. So he threw himself into calculations of every kind of vehicle on the planet powered by every kind of source available. Each time he came up with the same answer. ‘Every which way I did the numbers, the electric cars were a lot better than everything else,’ he said in a CNBC interview.1

There were a handful of electric cars on the market in the 1990s but nothing that struck Eberhard as looking more than very homemade and a little ‘go-kartish’. The one that did catch Eberhard’s eye was a fledgling electric car company by the name of AC Propulsion in California. They had developed an electric car called the TZero, but they were busy going out of business. Eberhard, already a highly successful entrepreneur in the tech world, invested his own money into saving the company, but still with only one goal in mind – for them to build him an electric car.

Eberhard and his good friend, Marc Tarpenning, had founded NuvoMedia in 1997. The company’s flagship product was the Rocket eBook, an early e-reader that could store up to ten books in electronic form. And it was Eberhard and Tarpenning’s work on improving the battery life and performance of the Rocket eBook that opened the door for their work on a better-performing electric car. The TZero was powered by a lead-acid battery. But Eberhard was turning his mind towards lithium-ion batteries, and he convinced AC Propulsion to convert the TZero to lithium-ion power.

‘That’s where it began,’2 he said.

Where they went from there, though, was an entirely different challenge. As Tarpenning pointed out, their Silicon Valley mindset gave them the confidence that they could make whatever powered the car, but they weren’t so confident about making the car itself. For this they partnered with English carmaker Lotus, which took care of the chassis and body for the first Tesla Roadster.

And so, on 1 July 2003, Tesla Motors Incorporated opened its doors. The company was named after Nikola Tesla (1856–1943), the Serbian-American inventor best known for his work on electromagnetic fields, and specifically for his contribution to the alternating current (AC) system.

But they ran up against resistance in the venture capital market. Quite simply, nobody wanted to invest. And that’s when a chance meeting at a space enthusiasts’ society brought them and Elon Musk together. In another of those seemingly unlikely coincidences that connect Elon Musk’s world, Eberhard and Tarpenning were founding members of the Mars Society, a non-profit organisation founded in 1998 to disseminate information about the Red Planet. At one of their annual conferences, Musk was a guest speaker – a man with means on a mission to Mars. As Eberhard admits, ‘He was intriguing. So we cornered him afterwards and talked for a while.’3

AC Propulsion, meanwhile, had also been chasing down Musk, trying to get him to invest in the company. But it was clear that Musk had no designs on AC Propulsion, so as part of the gentleman’s agreement they had with Tesla, they said they would back off Musk and Tesla was free to approach him if they wanted.

Eberhard sent Musk an email, proposing a meeting. This was around the time Musk was trying to buy ICBMs from Russia. In their first meeting with Musk, both Eberhard and Tarpenning were blown away by not only his immediate understanding of what they were trying to do but also his acceptance of it. Every venture capital firm had shut the door on them, saying they were crazy. But it was their good fortune to sit down with somebody more ‘crazy’ than they were. Musk was busy trying to privatise spaceflight. He was likely the only other person on the planet who would have understood what they were trying to do. ‘He totally got it,’ said Tarpenning.4

Musk was in. In 2004, he invested $6.35 million in Tesla’s Series A round of venture capital financing, and assumed the role of chairman of the board. In 2006, Musk convinced Google to invest in Tesla as part of another funding drive.

But success hinged on the car’s battery pack. Making it stable and being able to produce it safely and at scale were key to the concept of a workable electric car that looked good and performed well. As usual, Musk does a great job of explaining it in layman’s terms: ‘A battery is multiple cells. As the batteries get bigger and bigger, they get harder and harder to deal with. The challenge is combining those cells and having thousands of them and making sure they’re safe, making sure they’ll last for 200 000 miles over bumps and potholes and extremes of temperature and that they’re safe in a crash. That compounds the problem massively. The difficulty is at the pack level much more than at the cell level. That’s the single biggest area of Tesla’s expertise. The battery is the most important thing.

‘The Tesla battery pack weighs about one thousand pounds and it has the energy content of two-and-a-half gallons of gasoline. But the consumption of that energy is much more efficient in an electric car. An electric motor is super-efficient at turning energy into motion. It’s about 90 per cent efficient. A gasoline internal combustion engine is typically in the range of around 17 per cent or 18 per cent. Most of what it does is generate heat. It’s almost become convention that the future is electric cars. The only problem is this transitional period. If you look at the pace of battery improvement, it’s inevitable that the future will be entirely electric.’5

The idea to start with a sports car was vital to Tesla’s success. A sports car would allow Tesla to achieve their first goal – a car that looked good. The sports car market is also relatively small, which makes it less capital-intensive to enter with a developing technology. The sedan market, by virtue of its sheer volume, is where the real money is made, but its very scale makes it incredibly hard to start there.

So, in 2006, Tesla unveiled its first Roadster prototype.

The supply chain proved problematic, though, especially since most of what went into the Tesla Roadster had to be designed from scratch, and existing companies were simply unwilling to take the risk of supplying a start-up. In a sense, it was exactly the same problem Musk would run into with SpaceX, which forced his hand from a cost perspective to bring the majority of the supply chain in-house.

And while sorting out the hardware issues, Musk was embroiled in ‘software’ issues as well. Or, more precisely, personality issues. The relationship between Musk and Eberhard deteriorated, apparently over the question of who had founded Tesla and was the real brains behind the technology. Several early interviews in which Musk was not mentioned in relation to Tesla seemed to worsen the situation. Eberhard has asserted that Musk is trying to rewrite history, and to write him out of Tesla’s history in particular.

The result has been a long-standing feud between the two, interspersed with court battles and settlements. And it’s a battle Musk has largely been winning, from the moment he told his ‘cofounder’ that his time with Tesla was up. In a scene reminiscent of Musk’s own ousting as CEO of PayPal, Eberhard was dismissed as CEO of Tesla in 2007. It was a Musk-led initiative; he later described Eberhard as the worst person he’d ever worked with, and as someone who was bad for the progress of the company. Tarpenning left soon after Eberhard’s dismissal, deciding that he’d enjoyed the journey and was ready to move on.

But Tarpenning encountered a side of Musk that Eberhard perhaps couldn’t see or fully appreciate. Eberhard speaks with a sense of resentment at being forced out of what he believes he created, although he remains a shareholder in Tesla. ‘Elon’s done some pretty amazing things. I don’t understand why he has to say he was a founder of Tesla. I don’t understand that,’ he said in the CNBC interview.6

Tarpenning, though, saw something else in Musk that is a common theme in his life. ‘People want to do something that makes a difference,’ he said as he tried to explain Musk’s Tesla drive.7 It’s exactly this that lies at the heart of Musk’s own philosophy about mankind. His statement that he is ‘pro human’. His desire to spare humanity another mass-extinction event. And, despite the abuse he suffered from bullies as a child, his belief in the ultimate goodness of people. His philosophy that you need something exciting to wake up to in the morning. The promise of an exciting future. And in Musk’s mind, SpaceX and Tesla play a key role in the future he believes humankind should strive towards: ‘The fundamental goodness of Tesla … so like the “why” of Tesla, the relevance, what’s the point of Tesla, comes down to two things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy,’ Musk has said.8 ‘The acceleration of sustainable energy is absolutely fundamental, because this is the next potential risk for humanity. So obviously, that is, by far and away, the most important thing.’9

Autonomy will have an equally big impact. Driver autonomy, to be specific. In the case of Tesla, its vehicles are equipped with Autopilot features that enable the vehicle to steer, accelerate and brake automatically using a combination of cameras, sensors and computers. However, Tesla makes the point that its current Autopilot features still require ‘active driver supervision’ and ‘do not make the vehicle autonomous’.

Driver autonomy is perceived to be the next big thing in vehicle transport. According to a 2017 study conducted by Intel,10 when we no longer have to drive ourselves and can instead be passengers, it will spark an economic boom that will be known as the new ‘passenger economy’. And this is predicted to be worth $7 trillion by 2050. Intel predicts 250 million hours of commuting time will be freed up for people to do other things – entertain themselves, work more, buy more, invest more, think more, create more. This new architecture of human mobility will, futurists say, spark entire new industries and the birth of smart cities. Humanity will also be spared needless road deaths, with the study predicting that 585 000 lives will be saved between 2035 and 2045.

Futurist Greg Lindsay draws an interesting parallel between the drive towards the passenger economy and another of Musk’s interests – the space race: ‘Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, this is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge. The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the passenger economy demand ongoing dialogue … to look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to start-ups.’11

It’s being referred to as ‘car-venience’, and predictions of what this new economy will feature include onboard beauty salons, fast casual dining, remote vending, mobile health care clinics and treatment pods and onboard movies complete with location-based advertising. Or, as Musk puts it, ‘If you’re on the road, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of in terrible traffic.’12

The Tesla Roadster went into production in 2008. The Model S, an all-electric sedan, hit the market in 2012. In 2015, Tesla started introducing basic self-driving technology, such as autosteer and traffic-aware adaptive cruise control into its vehicles, using just one camera, a radar system and 12 sonar sensors. That year the company unveiled its Model X – ‘The safest, quickest and most capable sports utility vehicle in history’ according to the Tesla website. In 2017 came the Model 3, a ‘low-priced high-volume’ electric vehicle. Then a truck, the Tesla Semi, the Model Y mid-sized SUV and the Cybertruck, a type of SUV-sports crossover that looks like it was styled on the Batmobile.

On a similar financial timeline, in 2009 the Mercedes-Benz Group (formerly Daimler AG) invested $50 million for a ten per cent stake in Tesla, and the US Department of Energy agreed a $465 million loan to the company. In 2010, Musk took the company public with an initial public offering of $226 million, and Toyota invested $50 million as part of a strategic partnership to develop electric cars and parts. In May 2013, Tesla reported its first quarterly profit of $11 million. In 2017, Chinese ecommerce behemoth Tencent invested $1.8 billion in Tesla for a five per cent share of the company. In 2010, Tesla went public on the tech-heavy NASDAQ stock market at $17 a share. Its share price in September 2021 was $736.27.

By 2020, sales of Tesla vehicles had reached 500 000 units globally. In the United States alone, 81 per cent of battery-powered electric vehicles sold were Tesla vehicles. The company has been valued at $146 billion in a projected global electric vehicle market valued at $725 billion. The Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric plug-in vehicle, with a range of 520 km. In 2010, The Tesla Roadster was billed as the fastest car on the planet, leaving most traditional supercars in the dust. According to Musk, the latest version of the Roadster goes from zero to 100 km/h in 1.9 seconds with a top speed of 400 km/h, and a range of almost 1 000 km. It will also cost you R2.8 million. That would make it faster than the current model of the McLaren supercar, and significantly faster than the earlier version that Musk purchased with his Zip2 windfall.

Musk is rapidly expanding the company’s global footprint with the production of fast electric charging stations in major cities around the world, and in 2020 invested $6.42 million in setting up a plant in Shanghai to make charging poles.

As a Tesla owner, you can simply plug your car into a 120 V wall socket for a minimum of four kilometres of range for every hour of charge, or into a traditional 240 V wall socket for up to 50 km of range for every hour of charge. Purchase a Tesla wall connector and you can up this to 70 km of range for every hour of charge. A Tesla Supercharger – there are currently 25 000 of these worldwide – will get you 320 km of drive time in just 15 minutes of charging.

As quickly as it has built its footprint, Tesla has developed a passionate and almost cult-like following among owners. Apart from the various charging adaptors, you can buy merchandise and apparel, and even a Tesla Tequila, from the Tesla online shop.

Musk has even changed the model of the traditional car dealership. Once again, he was desperate to see past the old way of doing things in the automotive industry: ‘The US automotive industry has been selling cars the same way for over 100 years and there are many laws in place to govern exactly how that is to be accomplished. We do not seek to change those rules and we have taken great care not to act in a manner contrary to those rules.’13 And yet he’s sought to redefine those rules. So Tesla dealerships didn’t so much sell you cars as sell you a vision of the future of the car. There were no independently owned dealerships that brought in expensive middlemen for the consumer; Tesla sold directly to consumers. Musk made sure that Tesla stores were exactly this – stores, not car dealerships. Much like the Apple stores, the Tesla stores were retail experiences for a consumer to see just what is out there and what is possible.

But the consumer model of these stores has entailed lengthy legal and regulatory battles in certain US states. These difficulties prompted Musk to close many of the stores and instead pursue a more aggressive online sales model. According to the company, with a click you can now buy a Tesla, and with a click you can also return one within seven days or 1 600 km for a full refund. A limited number of stores have remained open in key locations, but more as marketing experiences for consumers to engage with the cars.

And the fans’ love for Tesla is as powerful as their chargers. They are a perfect example of what Musk has always sought to achieve as an engineer – creating products that people love.

Tesla owners have developed their own lingo, and refer to traditional cars as ‘ICE’ (for internal combustion engine). A typical comment from a Tesla owner to a traditional car owner would be along the lines of ‘Why on earth would you buy ICE over Tesla?’

Tesla fans love the Autopilot, the Netflix streaming, the touchscreen technology, the Tesla app and all the technology that makes their driving experience that much more pleasurable. It’s exciting, as exciting as the future that Musk has always sought to create, and that he has always maintained is what should drive you to get out of bed in the morning. And it’s also good for the Earth. ‘If you want a high-performance car with a clean conscience, this is the only option,’ says Musk.14

In short, Tesla owners pride themselves on having a car that looks good, drives good and does good. Such is the fanaticism around their love for their cars that it’s hard to distinguish between their devotion to Tesla and their devotion to Elon Musk. The same people who call themselves ‘Teslaholics’ are also referred to as ‘Musketeers’.

But, as every musketeer knows, there is always a Cardinal Richelieu who takes a different view of things, and Musk’s Tesla adventure hasn’t been without its skirmishes. In 2008, which was a good year for the new electric car company, when it unveiled the Tesla Roadster, it collided with the most devastating year for Musk. As we saw in the previous chapter, Musk’s life was in turmoil. His business life was no different: SpaceX was floundering, and Tesla was losing money faster than its car batteries could be recharged.

Then came his eleventh-hour Christmas Miracle.

But Tesla’s road ahead would still be filled with many potholes.

In 2008, an auto industry blog launched the ‘Tesla Death Watch’ – a countdown to what they believed was the demise of Tesla. The Tesla Death Watch was the brainchild of automotive industry analyst Edward Niedermeyer, who had long harboured suspicions about Tesla. In 2019, his book Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors made the claim that ‘Behind the hype, Tesla has some serious deficiencies that raise questions about its sky-high valuation, and even its ultimate survival.’ The book, its cover says, ‘lays bare the disconnect between the popular perception of Tesla and the day-to-day realities of the company – and the cars it produces.’15

Niedermeyer has had a particular issue with ‘Tesla’s attempt to merge Silicon Valley arrogance with automotive industry standards’.16 And Tesla has had its own issues with Niedermeyer. In a 2016 press release headed ‘A Grain of Salt’ and responding to safety concerns about the Model S suspension, Tesla declared: ‘Finally, it is worth noting that the blogger who fabricated this issue, which then caused negative and incorrect news to be written about Tesla by reputable institutions, is Edward Niedermeyer. This is the same gentle soul who previously wrote a blog titled “Tesla Death Watch,” which starting on May 19, 2008 was counting the days until Tesla’s death. It has now been 2 944 days. We just checked our pulse and, much to his chagrin, appear to be alive. It is probably wise to take Mr Niedermeyer’s words with at least a small grain of salt. We don’t know if Mr Niedermeyer’s motivation is simply to set a world record for axe-grinding or whether he or his associates have something financial to gain by negatively affecting Tesla’s stock price, but it is important to highlight that there are several billion dollars in short sale bets against Tesla. This means that there is a strong financial incentive to greatly amplify minor issues and to create false issues from whole cloth. That said, sometimes Tesla does make genuine mistakes. We are not and have never claimed to be perfect. However, we strongly believe in trying to do the right thing and, when we fall short, taking immediate corrective action.’17

But Tesla has certainly been a wild ride for Musk.

In 2009, Tesla cofounder Eberhard began his legal battle with Musk. Indeed, much of Musk’s Tesla time seems to involve legal issues. Since 2008, Tesla is reported to have been a party to over 1 000 lawsuits around everything from treatment of workers to actual technical issues, and of course the bigger boardroom issues with Eberhard and SolarCity.

Musk has found himself playing PR director as much as CEO as he’s addressed issues such as vehicles catching fire, alleged deaths from collisions while using Autopilot and other problems. In 2013, he went to war with The New York Times over what he said was a ‘fake’ review of the Tesla Model S, in which the writer claimed the car’s battery range was not what it was said to be.

That year, a Tesla Model S caught fire while on the road. The company’s stock went into a nose dive and Tesla’s future was once again on the ropes. Musk was reportedly considering selling the company to Google for $6 billion.

In 2016, Autopilot malfunctioned on several cars, and in one case was said to have caused a fatal crash. In 2017, Toyota sold its stake in Tesla. That same year Tesla stock crashed again, losing about $12 billion, after the company failed to meet its production targets.

In 2018, Musk’s propensity to tweet before he thinks provided the next Tesla crisis. After he tweeted that he was considering ‘taking Tesla private at $420’ with ‘funding secured’, Tesla stock soared by ten per cent. But the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for ‘false and misleading’ statements to Tesla investors. Musk settled with the SEC for $20 million, as well as a $20 million fine for the company and a pledge that he would monitor his social media usage in the future. The SEC had also been tipped off by a former Tesla employee who claimed that the company supressed an internal investigation into criminal activity at its Nevada Gigafactory, which produces the batteries for Tesla vehicles, including rampant theft of copper wire and even allegations of drug trafficking. An investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration found that a Tesla employee had links to a Mexican drug cartel. The Gigafactory was also under investigation by local police for the number of employee accidents, and even a death, that had occurred on site. It was alleged that fear of Musk’s finding out, and his own concern about negative publicity and its impact on Tesla, in turn made employees fearful about reporting or acting on allegations. It is a harsh assessment to make of a CEO, who cannot conceivably know every single thing that occurs on the factory floor, criminal or not. But Musk has never been held to the standards of a normal CEO.

Also in 2018, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation into whether the company had misled investors about its production capabilities. In 2019, Musk was forced to cut Tesla staff by seven per cent, and an exodus of top executives followed. In February that year, Musk’s Twitter account again drew the ire of the SEC as he tweeted that Tesla would make 500 000 vehicles that year, breaching their agreement that his tweets would be monitored.

Amid this, another fatality occurred when a Tesla driver in a Model 3 using Autopilot collided with a truck. Musk has vigorously defended all such cases, often using vehicle logbooks and making comprehensive and data-driven cases that driver error was at fault.



MUSK’S Twitter actions also caused unhappiness within his board, which reached a tipping point in June and July 2018 during the Tham Luang cave rescue. A Thai junior football team and their coach had found themselves trapped in the cave system by a rising, rain-swollen river, and in response a massive international rescue effort was mobilised. Musk took to Twitter to accuse the expatriate British spelunker Vernon Unsworth, one of the volunteer rescuers, of being a paedophile.

Musk and Unsworth had publicly argued about the best way to rescue the boys and their coach. While the 64-year-old Unsworth, a veteran cave diver, was recruiting diving specialists to rescue the boys, Musk sent a team of SpaceX and Tesla engineers and a mini-submarine to Thailand to assist with the rescue effort.

But when Unsworth branded Musk’s offer a ‘PR stunt’ and suggested he ‘stick his submarine where it hurts’, Musk reacted. In one tweet he referred to Unsworth as ‘pedo guy’, allegedly because he resided in Chiang Rai province, an area notorious for child sex trafficking.

Journalist Ryan Mac actually spoke to Musk about this leap of judgement. At the time, Mac was a senior technology reporter at BuzzFeed.18 He later joined The New York Times to cover accountability in the world of technology. Mac had uncovered scathing internal criticism of Facebook by its own staff, and had exposed Peter Thiel’s secret funding of wrestler Hulk Hogan’s court case against Gawker Media (2013–2016). Mac reached out to Musk via email for his BuzzFeed article, asking whether he would like to comment on having received a letter from Unsworth’s lawyer. In his off-the-record response, Musk made various allegations about Unsworth’s being a ‘child rapist’, as well as a poor diver, and said he welcomed the prospect of being sued.19

Mac followed up with several emails questioning Musk’s facts, and also asserting that he hadn’t agreed to any ‘off the record’ conversations himself so wouldn’t treat it as such. ‘Sometimes people think the words “off the record” are a magic command and, once uttered, immediately go into effect to hide what comes after. But in reality, a journalist and their source have to both agree to that condition before it can be established. Musk and I did not,’ Mac wrote.20 After several back-and-forth emails, Musk reportedly responded with a final mail to Mac: ‘Get lost, you creep.’

Mac’s further investigation later revealed that the ‘private investigator’ who had first tipped off Musk that Unsworth was a ‘child rapist’ was in fact a phoney. He was a convicted fraudster. And Musk had believed him.

Musk later deleted the tweet and apologised, which actually proved his greatest asset in the legal battle that ensued as Unsworth sued him for $190 million. The case was seen as ground-breaking in terms of the legal threshold for defamation on social media. And in the most unlikely way, Musk impacted on this as well. His defence lawyers argued the concept of ‘JDart’, an acronym for Twitter users who tweet something inappropriate that is badly received, and who then apologise and delete the tweet. A Los Angeles jury ruled in favour of Musk.

But in the course of his investigation, Mac hit on what he believed was a true glimpse into the psyche and character of Elon Musk. As he wrote on BuzzFeed, in going to court with an individual over what amounted to nothing more than Musk’s believing he had been disrespected by Unsworth, and feeling aggrieved enough about this to engage not only his own Twitter account but also his multitude of Musketeers, who vehemently support him and actively troll anybody who doesn’t, ‘the billionaire entrepreneur brought the same drive that pushed electric cars into the mainstream to a legal dispute over his own bad behavior. And in typical fashion, Musk defied the odds. He won … But in many ways, it is far more revealing of Musk than any of the technological feats that land him in the headlines. The weeklong trial showcased Musk’s bending of reality, a skill that’s part of his mythology but rarely seen outside his work. It’s something he uses to convince an engineer to perfect a car part for days on end or push a public relations staffer to disappear a bad story, and it’s often rescued him from the brink of failure.’21

According to Mac, Elon’s version of reality is highly skewed … ‘In the case of Unsworth, he used it to convince himself that a critic was a pedophile simply because he happened to be an older white man living in Thailand. Then, when threatened with a defamation lawsuit, Musk and his lawyers built out an alternate reality: one where he played a key role in the cave rescue, where “pedo guy” was a common playground insult [in South Africa], and where he did not attempt to destroy a hero who had criticized him.’

Mac revealed that a former Tesla executive told him after the trial, ‘Elon has an uncanny ability to tell a story he wants to be true, convince himself that it has to be true, and then convince others.’22

The court case, which should have been a trivial event in the world of Elon Musk, actually proved to be anything but. For Musk’s critics, it proved their assertion that he was unhinged and suffering under the pressure of Tesla’s not meeting its production targets. It was at this time that Musk was reportedly sleeping on the Tesla factory floor as he tried both to right the ship and to fend off vehement media criticism that he took personally. Investors were also famously ‘shorting’ Tesla stock at every opportunity.

For the Musketeers, though, the court case was a vindication that Musk had once again been unfairly treated by a media that cherry-picked its facts in order to make him and his companies look bad, and the legal system had finally proved this.

For the objective observer, it was a worrying glimpse into the psyche of a brilliant man who was displaying the same bullying tendencies that he had encountered at Bryanston High School. When Musk asserted in court that ‘pedo guy’ was South African slang for a creepy old white man, a number of South Africans – some of them his contemporaries – took to Twitter saying they had never heard this term used before. Mac investigated this himself and said he couldn’t find any mention of this term being associated with South African slang.



THE ‘hero’ or ‘hype’ debate is one that often surrounds Musk, and Tesla provides an interesting case study. Whether Tesla actually makes a profit or not is a complicated matter. And even its profits are complicated.

Tesla is essentially a company that specialises in a very niche market of electric vehicles that cost anything from $40 000 to $150 000. Its production output is not close to that of the traditional automakers, although it is growing. In 2020, Tesla produced 510 000 cars. Volkswagen produced close to nine million cars in the same year.

Tesla reportedly enjoyed its first profitable year in 2020, sixteen years after Musk first invested in the company. It seems a long time to go without making a profit, and yet in this time Musk has managed on more than one occasion to grow investor interest and keep money flowing into a company that has been close to bankruptcy on a few occasions.

Even the very nature of ‘profit’ is confusing in the Tesla sense.

Regulations in 11 US states demand that automakers must sell a percentage of zero-emission vehicles by 2025. If they cannot meet this percentage, they have to buy regulatory credits from a company that does meet the requirements – a company such as Tesla, which exclusively sells electric vehicles. This has proved a huge financial boost for Tesla. CNN Business has estimated that in the five years before 2020, it accounted for $3.3 billion for Tesla.23 Furthermore, Tesla’s net income in 2020 was $721 million, but its regulatory credit income was $1.6 billion. The result was that Tesla could declare a ‘profit’. It has been making more money off other car companies and its credits than from actual car sales. Then there is the bitcoin connection.

Musk has managed social media better than any other CEO who has ever sat in the corner office. And he’s done it most effectively with cryptocurrencies. His tweets about the merits of certain cryptocurrencies have quite literally moved the markets. He has single-handedly determined the price of bitcoin with his tweets. At one point, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin. The company then sold ten per cent of this for $101 million, which enabled Tesla to make a profit. Tesla was making more money selling bitcoins than actual cars.

And yet Tesla’s value has soared to the point that it is now the world’s most valuable car company – above traditional giants such as Toyota, Volkswagen and BMW – despite taking several years to actually be profitable. Shares in Tesla rose 700 per cent in 2020. For what Tesla is now worth and future predictions of what it will be worth, it could buy every major car company out there. It has made millionaires out of those who invested early, spawning a group of what are now called ‘Teslanaires’.

Investment analysts refer to Tesla as a ‘polarising stock’ because of the faith some have in it and the scepticism of others. Many feel the stock is hopelessly overvalued. Musk has famously said so himself, and has held Twitter polls asking whether people agree. In 2021, he shocked the investment world when he asked his followers whether he should sell ten per cent of his Tesla shares in order to increase his taxable income.24 The real reason behind the sale, though, was that a massive tax bill was headed his way as a result of stock options he had received many years earlier. He had to sell those shares, or lose them. But Musk was taking a bigger swipe at the US tax system in general, stating, ‘Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance.’ Musk has often argued that his wealth lies not in his own cash but in his companies, and that he does not take a salary but instead holds stock. He has since had a few Twitter encounters with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is a leading proponent of further taxing the extremely wealthy as part of a call for a ‘billionaires’ income tax’. As the richest person on the planet, Musk is a clear target. And yet the value of Tesla continues to soar on his watch, and the kind of volatility he generates is clearly not an issue for the markets.

Even Tesla’s actual identity is up for debate. Some argue that Tesla is more a tech company than a car company. And Musk has proved himself brilliant at using this to his advantage. It’s a car company. It’s a tech company. It’s a battery company. It’s a conscience company. It’s a cryptocurrency company. It’s a solar power company. It’s a social movement. It’s a hope of things to come.

Much like SpaceX, the money seems to be drawn to what Tesla can become and what the company represents as the future.

As Marc Tarpenning once put it, ‘Elon is complicated. He delves into everything, which can be both a positive and a negative. He pushes on certain things in development that you kind of wonder why. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn’t. He’s very much into risk. He’s willing to take on financial risks for himself personally, and technology risks when he’s working on something new that is a little out there but when it works it’s really amazing. But of course there’s lots of sort of collateral damage along the way. But it’s a way to make things work.’25

Musk is acutely strategic. He is able to convince investors to become part of his grandiose projects. But at the same time he publicly declares that he never believed either SpaceX or Tesla would succeed, and that they would probably erode his personal fortune. It’s the kind of brutal honesty that perhaps gives investors the comfort of knowing that if it didn’t work out, he has at least been honest with them.

As for comments that Tesla is overvalued. Well, Musk agrees. In 2021, when Tesla’s stock price reached $760, Musk tweeted that he thought the price was too high. And yet investors and the market keep following him.

So what is Tesla really worth? What is Tesla actually?

While those questions keep being asked, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Kia and Volkswagen will continue spending billions on their own lines of electric vehicles. And on becoming what Tesla started.

In the race to build electric cars, Musk is now being followed closely by the other major car manufacturers. CNN Business estimates that in 2018 the number of electric vehicles on the road around the world reached over five million – a 40 per cent increase from the year before. The constant improvements in battery technology and the environmental incentive to produce greener batteries are major drivers of growth. In 2015, battery cost as a percentage of the retail price of a medium-sized vehicle in the US was just under 75 per cent. It is predicted to drop to around 25 per cent by 2025. Vehicle range and charging infrastructure will be the other major obstacles to overcome in the years ahead.

Tesla is still the frontrunner here in terms of sales. Musk’s company took the top spot in 2017 with almost 100 000 cars sold. This put it at number one, ahead of Geely, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Hyundai, GM, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Toyota.

It remained there in 2018 with 222 000 cars sold.

But taking into account current production and research and development, CNN Business predicts that Volkswagen will take over the top spot in 2025, followed by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Geely and then Tesla.

Musk was spot-on. The future of the automobile is indeed electric. The future of Tesla lies in its ability to stay in the race. It’s had a great head start. But Musk is well aware that one of the challenges of being first is that it gives everybody else something to aim at.

When it comes to the space race, Musk is doing his best to stay in front. And for now, he’s winning.
