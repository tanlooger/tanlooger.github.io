title: His Future Among the Stars

WHEN I started this journey of Elon Musk, it was with the immediate realisation that anything Musk does has an exponential ripple effect.

The first interview I listened to was his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience on 7 September 2018. It was a wide-ranging conversation, covering his thoughts on love, humanity, the sustainability of Earth, Mars and the danger of robots taking over the world, but it was overshadowed by a few seconds and a puff of smoke. ‘Elon Musk smokes weed on Joe Rogan podcast’ was the headline that went viral.

The second realisation was that any biography of Musk would be merely a snapshot of the man at a particular time. Musk moves faster than he tweets. You could quite easily add a chapter a month to a biography of him, such is his wide-ranging impact in a variety of fields. Anything he says is of consequence. Anything he does is captured and analysed.

At the time of writing, David Beasley, the director of the World Food Programme (WFP), was quoted in a CNN article as saying that two per cent of Musk’s wealth would solve world hunger. Solve world hunger. It’s the kind of comment that often involves Musk. You are the richest man on Earth, thus your money can solve Earth’s problems.

Musk responded. And he responded in a way that most are never ready for: show me how, and I’ll do it. More accurately, he tweeted: ‘If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6 billion will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it’.

Right there lies the true genius of Musk. For the comic-book fans, his true superpower is beyond anything Iron Man represents.

Elon Musk will attempt anything he can get his head around. And he will attempt things in industries and realms that people have generally believed to be too big to change – be it financial services, the car industry or spaceflight. Or even world hunger.

This is exactly what people love about him. Elon Musk has a vision, and nothing is too big for that vision. And he expresses it with a sincerity that sometimes sees him tear up in interviews. As big and bold as his ego can be, he can also describe criticism he has received as ‘hurtful’. His ideas, and sometimes even the man himself, appear almost naive. Others have described him as ruthless. His own brother has said he possesses many great qualities, but empathy for others is not high up on the list.

And yet it’s in the simplicity of asking what nobody else has thought to ask that Musk seems to find new solutions to the complexity of issues nobody has ever thought to question. Much like his grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, he is a pioneer and an adventurer. Grandad Haldeman climbed into a plane and took his adventures around the world. Musk appears more interested in the adventures that lie within his own imagination. As such, he has great value to offer. In a short space of time, he has revolutionised several industries.

Whether you agree with him or not, whether you believe his companies to be a success or not, it cannot be argued that when Musk steps into an industry, change occurs.

Before Elon Musk, the move towards electric vehicles was still seen as a novelty and was moving at a glacial pace. Now, no major vehicle manufacturer can envision not having a viable electric vehicle in its product line. It’s become an absolute necessity. Musk has, as he said all along, accelerated this change.

And he will continue to change.

This is a man who has world-shifting ideas in the shower, who finds it hard to sleep, who works ferociously. And this is a man who is far from finished.

Even as I write, Elon Musk is debating plans to solve world hunger and launching a constellation of satellites into low Earth orbit to help lower Internet costs as part of SpaceX’s Starlink initiative. In February 2022, he reportedly provided thousands of Starlink satellite kits (including a router and satellite dish) to embattled Ukraine to help support their communications systems, which were severely affected by Russian bombing. He is cautioning against unregulated AI, pushing the boundaries of space exploration, furthering the technology of electric cars, drilling tunnels to solve traffic, seeking the hidden answers to human brain malfunctions, debating new forms of currency and even being asked what kind of system of government he’d like to see on Mars. And on top of all of this he places his Holy Grail – the preservation of human consciousness, that most rare of things in the entire universe.

And somewhere, perhaps he will finally find the true love he so desperately seeks and claims he cannot live or work without.



THE intention of this book was never to provide a comprehensive biography. Rather, it was to offer an overview of the life of a man with South African roots, and how his roots may have shaped him into becoming a colossus of our age.

There was a time when people looked to the far reaches of the planet. For adventurers, explorers and pioneers, the focus was on discovering far-off lands, climbing the highest peaks, exploring the depths of the oceans. And then the focus began to shift inwards. The great journey of discovery was the mind and the emotions, and of being rather than doing. Perhaps what Musk has done is to draw us back to the big, bold ideas. He has pulled us out of ourselves again, and made us once again look up. At a time when our focus has narrowed to the 16:9 frame on an Instagram screen, he has pulled us out again and reminded us all to dream big.

So I’ve tried to give some context to Elon Musk – where he’s come from, and where he’s going to.

It’s been an incredible journey, and clearly, this is not where his story ends.

It’s a moment of Musk.

Or, in the words of Elon, ‘I’m just being me.’
