title: The Cult of Elon Musk
---




IN the 2012 blockbuster film The Avengers, the eccentric billionaire Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) turns to Captain America and nonchalantly says, ‘Following’s not really my style.’ Elon Musk’s fans have long held him to be the real-life version of Stark, and indeed the inspiration behind actor Robert Downey Jnr’s portrayal of this character in the successful Marvel franchise.

Following is indeed not Elon Musk’s style. But having followers certainly is. On Twitter, his most active social media platform, Musk has 61.3 million followers. These include everyone from professional golfers to politicians. He, in turn, follows 106 people or institutions.

Musk gets an average of almost 100 000 likes per tweet. His tweets can be obscure, funny, intelligent, market-altering, boastful or sometimes just plain strange. But they always move the needle. So much so that 52 of Musk’s famous tweets have been immortalised in a colouring book created by one of his most ardent fans, the artist Salina Gomez. The Illuminated Tweets of Elon Musk is described on her website, Ill Ink, as ‘Gonzo visual editorial journalism in the form of a coloring book’.1

Writing on the tech website The Verge in 2018 under the heading ‘The Gospel of Elon Musk According to his Flock’, Bijan Stephen recounts how Gomez, who was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, had stumbled on Musk’s tweets, which convinced her that there were still people in the world doing good things. ‘That was the only thing giving me hope, you know, to keep going,’ she said.2

Musk has had songs written about him (‘The Future Smells like Elon Musk’ by Jim and Kathy Ocean), he’s appeared on NBC’s Saturday Night Live, he’s been the subject of university studies and theoretical papers, and he has an army of Twitter followers who literally move at his command.

Musk has been described as a visionary, a charlatan, a genius, a conman and the saviour of humankind. For some, his technology and ideas make him a master disruptor, while others see him as a master deflector, using those same grand ideas to deflect attention from any negative criticism.

The rise of Elon Musk began with his attempt to revolutionise the financial services industry. But his critics will point to the role of Confinity and Peter Thiel in the founding of PayPal. They will also say that Tesla was already in existence and making electric cars, thanks to Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, before Musk invested in the company. While some describe him as an engineer, others say he is no more than a venture capitalist. Among the scores of YouTube videos about Musk, there is one that asks, ‘Is Elon Musk a psychopath?’ It appears on the Common Sense Skeptic channel, which offers a range of other clips about Musk and his companies.

A mainly online group known as TSLAQ (tslaq.org/) have made it their mission to gather data that they believe exposes the shortcomings of both Musk and Tesla. Their very name demonstrates their purpose: TSLA is how Tesla is listed on the NASDAQ, and Q is the NASDAQ notation for bankruptcy.

TSLAQ has gone so far as to label Tesla a fraudulent company. They are hardly alone. Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks in history. (Shorting is when investors literally bet on the failure of the stock.) And yet the company’s value continues to climb. In October 2021, Tesla’s stock value broke the $1 trillion barrier for the first time after car rental giant Hertz placed an order for 100 000 Tesla vehicles in a bid to bolster its fleet with electric vehicles.

Even the Hertz deal came amid ongoing investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as to why Tesla was contining to manufacture vehicles incorporating its Autopilot technology when it had yet to fully respond to the NTSB’s concerns and queries over the safety of this technology. Tesla has been involved in more than 1 000 lawsuits.

Another matter of debate is fatal collisions involving Tesla vehicles. On the TSLAQ website, under ‘Tesla Safety’, there is a link to TeslaDeaths.com, which records in detail fatalities ‘that involved a driver, occupant, cyclist, motorcyclist, or pedestrian death, whether or not the Tesla or its driver were at fault’. As of 30 October 2021, it was claimed that ten deaths were related Tesla’s Autopilot, out of a total of 210 Tesla-related fatalities. One of the main drivers of their research is to prove a supposed disconnect between Musk’s claims about the safety of Tesla vehicles and the facts.

Dig further on the Internet, and there is an entire subculture questioning Musk. The website gotmusked.com is a good example, and once again its main focus is Tesla. It questions everything from the validity of Tesla’s actual advantage in battery technology (it showcases the data to prove otherwise) to even Musk’s perceived genius. In fact, it questions everything about Musk himself.

It was here that I discovered the questions surrounding Musk’s claim that he attended Stanford University and dropped out. Evidence is presented in the form of court records from the legal case between Eberhard and Musk, affirming that there are no records of his having enrolled at Stanford. But this still doesn’t discount the fact that Musk was indeed accepted by Stanford. This is not a fabrication.

Gotmusked goes so far as to declare in bold letters, ‘Elon Musk is a charlatan, not a genius, and possesses no genius or expertise outside of marketing, sales, and pushing propaganda’. If you google ‘Elon Musk Fraud’ you are presented with 6 530 000 results. ‘Elon Musk Conman’ will call up 2 580 000 results. But ‘Elon Musk Genius’ brings forth 36 400 000 results, and ‘Elon Musk Hero’ 10 200 000 results.

Musk has many detractors, and they go to great lengths to make their point heard. Among them are Bernie Sanders, Sarah Palin, Bill Gates, Jeremy Clarkson, the SEC, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. All have very clear faults of their own. But it could be that Musk is the ‘people’s billionaire’, at a time in history when people are feeling a significant disconnect from those who make the rules.

Yet some people seem to take it personally that Musk is playing in their fields of expertise, and allegedly without sufficient knowledge. Continue digging, and you will come across Piekniewski’s Blog (blog.piekniewski.info/). Filip Piekniewski PhD describes himself as a ‘researcher working on computer vision and AI’. He’s a ‘senior scientist’ and ‘software engineer’ working for Accel Robotics, based in San Diego, California. His thoughts on AI in particular have seen him quoted in scholarly publications, on popular websites and also by the BBC.

On 28 December 2018, Piekniewski posted: ‘I must admit, a few years back I thought he is literally the next Steve Jobs, only actually better, since he was onto so many things … I admired SpaceX, thought that Tesla cars had many great solutions in them …’3

But Piekniewski says he began to harbour suspicions when Musk ventured into the realm of AI, his own specialist field: ‘At some point in 2015 or 2016 Elon started talking outrageous stuff in the domain of AI, a domain of my own expertise, which I could tell right away was total bullshit. And then I began looking at all this stuff in detail. Doing some math here and there. Reading various opinions. As a result, my opinion on Musk and many of his ideas has changed somewhat substantially. At this point, I can pretty much say with confidence that 90% of his stuff is utter BS, and the remaining 10% is perhaps impressive but still questionable.’4

In a post titled ‘Elon and the Collective’, Piekniewski addresses what he believes are the inconsistencies throughout Musk’s career. He did this, he says, because he was tired of trying to explain it every time he met a Musk devotee. He starts with SpaceX’s reusable rockets, arguing that the idea itself is not as revolutionary as Musk claims and has been in existence for some time. So why, you ask, hasn’t it been developed further until now? Piekniewski believes the answer lies in the cost:


The space shuttle program had exactly the same aim: a reusable space plane with reusable boosters. Only the main fuel tank burned up in the atmosphere but that was not a huge sacrifice, since the tank did not have engines, which are by far the most expensive part. However, although good-looking on paper, it turned out to be a commercial disaster. The shuttle had to be essentially taken apart after every mission (and even then there were a few close calls and two full-blown disasters). Ultimately, lifting cargo on a shuttle was much more expensive than using a regular, disposable rocket.

The rocket as it performs ascent and then descent undergoes some serious accelerations (way higher than a typical plane), while being built extremely delicately to minimize the mass (much tighter margins than an airliner). The rocket engine undergoes much higher stress than a jet engine. Hence all that stress can cause material fatigue and small malfunctions, while the margin for error on a rocket is extremely small. Hence if e.g. it turns out that the risk of mission failure on these reused boosters increases substantially after every use, all the anticipated savings from reusability may be quickly wiped out by one or two lost missions. And it should be noted, that the cargo that goes into space is often MUCH more expensive than the rocket itself.

So essentially we are exploring here the amount of tail risk that we can shave to get some savings. And for that we need data. A lot of data. And the fact that someone did it once or even ten times is not sufficient to declare a victory. Each of the space shuttles flew dozens of times, when one of the SpaceX boosters will have flown 100 times with between flights maintenance at an economical level, then it will be an actual success. And we are not close to that yet.5


Piekniewski is more damning on Musk’s goal of colonising Mars: ‘This sounds very romantic, and I think that if we stretched ourselves quite a bit, we could probably send an Apollo-style mission to Mars, mainly to plant a flag and get some samples. That alone would be dangerous as hell and really technically difficult, but permanent structure, Mars city, colonization, these are just sci-fi musings.’6

He delves into the science behind his contention, science that he argues makes even the threat of mass extinction on Earth a less inhospitable proposition than living on Mars: ‘The argument often brought up here is that humans need to go multiplanetary to avoid extinction. I’m willing to accept that argument, but the disaster necessary to make Earth less hospitable than Mars would have to be truly epic. If we detonated all the nukes ever made, we would not get even close. There would still be atmosphere, plenty of water, manageable temperatures. It would seriously need to be a planetary-scale cataclysm, way beyond the thing that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. So this argument as it stands is bullshit.’7

But detonating all the nuclear weapons on Earth would indeed precipitate an environmental catastrophe, and the electromagnetic pulse from the combined blast power would likely shut down modern life as we know it.

Yet Piekniewski doesn’t discount the need for space exploration, and supports Musk’s belief that the future for humans as a species lies herein. But he’d far rather see a focus on the moon than Mars. He argues, quite simply, that the Moon is closer and we’ve been there before: ‘We should just find some cave on the Moon and start building a permanent base there. Perhaps deeper under the Moon’s surface we would find the necessary resources such as water and carbon dioxide (water seems to be present in the always shaded craters). If we learned how to kickstart manufacturing there, the Moon would be a great outpost for launching more distant missions further down the road. Aiming at colonizing Mars now is simply silly.’8

Yet Musk is sinking his entire fortune into chasing this ‘silly’ idea. He’s not the only one, but he’s certainly the most ambitious and has the greatest appetite for going into space. There is a difficult balance to strike between Musk’s grandiose plan to save humanity and colonise Mars, and Piekniewski’s retort that it would be better to rather find a cave on the moon and build a base there.

On the subject of The Boring Company, Piekniewski is once again ruthless in his assessment: ‘This is advertised as a solution to mass transit. Now again, this is simply ridiculous. First of all, electric cars in tunnels carrying people en masse is an old idea. It is called a metro, and it has been known and used all over the world for more than 100 years. Now let’s dig to some numbers: a typical metro car weighs some 40 tons and is able to take 175 people (probably more if they squeeze). It means the infrastructure mass is some 228 kg per passenger. A Tesla model X weighs 2.7 tons and takes 5 (max 7) passengers. That means the mass of the infrastructure is 380–540 kg per passenger. Right there, without even going any further into other things, the raw cost of mass of infrastructure carried, which translates to the amount of energy necessary to operate, is roughly 2x that of actual mass transit. A train does not need to carry a battery for example, just takes the energy from the third rail. In addition a train has much lower rolling friction, etc … This is just a tip of the iceberg. There is so much wrong with this idea that it is hard to know where to start.’9

In assessing the Tesla Autopilot idea, Piekniewski states the obvious. Cars will never drive themselves, and shouldn’t, and any vehicle manufacturer that claims to have ‘self-driving technology’ is lying: ‘Autopilot, as impressive as it is as a cruise control system, is not by any means autonomous driving ready. Anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot, period, and should be rapidly taken out of the road because he is endangering innocent people. The fact that this technology has been released as “beta” to [the] general public is irresponsible and significant number of fatalities [have] already occurred.’10

On SolarCity and the solar roof tiles debacle, Piekniewski declares, ‘like with many of Elon’s promises the devil is in the mundane engineering details’. In fact, he seems to predict the fire hazard that Walmart had to deal with: ‘The problem is electric connectivity. Each tile needs to be connected to others, these connections have to be element resistant (it is a roof after all!) and reliable. Getting that to work is not easy and fragile. Wind, tiny earthquakes or even birds walking along the roof displace the tiles ever so slightly and they lose contact. Once the circuit is broken it is difficult to find and fix the fault. Even worse a short circuit can lead to heating and fire danger.’11

On the Tesla front, Piekniewski wonders whether they are as far ahead of the traditional competition as claimed: ‘Tesla has issues with stuff long solved by every other manufacturer: panel alignment, leaking seals, paint job blemishes, rattling plastics, all sorts of QA [quality assurance] things. And I’m not making this stuff up. Twitter, Tesla forums and even fan-based vlogs on YouTube are full of complaints and horror service stories. This may have been growing pains for a 4–6-year-old niche car company, but Tesla has been around for more than 15 years, burned through tens of billions of dollars (mostly debt, which Tesla has roughly $10 billion of) and is valued on the stock market above Ford and GMC … I won’t even go into the mountain of issues the short sellers bring up – even if only one third of their findings are true, this company is in a complete management chaos. What is certainly true is the long list of executives departing one by one over the last few years, this is indicative of authoritarian management and toxic company culture to say the least. So all in all, certainly not everything is right about this company, and I’m sure all these short sellers are there for good reason, they smell bullshit.’12

At the end of his lengthy evaluation, Piekniewski declares, ‘Although resistance to Elon and his fans is futile, and we will all be assimilated, I call bullshit. I think the crowds of people who think Elon is the savior of mankind will be in for a great disappointment. Extravagant entrepreneur, great salesman, dreamer he is. But second incarnation of Jesus, savior of the planet and genius engineer he is not. Time will tell if I was right.’13

The blog post yielded close to 60 replies, some praising him for pointing out the obvious, and others lambasting him for not being a believer. Yet the 2018 post also underestimates Musk. Piekniewski declares, ‘As of the end of 2018 SpaceX hasn’t flown a single human to orbit.’ Two years later, Musk and SpaceX ticked this box.

I reached out to Piekniewski to ask whether this single achievement had perhaps changed his views on Musk. ‘No. There was absolutely nothing that has changed my mind,’ he wrote back. ‘SpaceX? Yes, they launch rockets. Whether the economy of their process is any better than fully disposable rocket remains to be seen. As far as I know the company still requires external funds and does not operate at a profit. It’s a bit of a long story but with rockets all that matters is price per kg to orbit. When a stage is reused, part of its fuel, which could give the payload a lot of extra acceleration, needs to be saved for landing. Which in turn causes that the total load to orbit be approximately half than if it was disposable. Which in turn means that the same payload sent to orbit with a reusable rocket can be sent into space with a smaller rocket. In the grand scheme of things, the gains from reusability, even if they exist at all, will be at the order of 20 per cent, nowhere close [to] the promised ten times. It’s simply the math of this particular problem.’

Then I asked him about Mars. Much like Dr Moogega Cooper, Piekniewski believes Mars is a pipe dream: ‘Mars is a delusion just like it was before. In fact Musk has sent absolutely nothing to Mars. One would expect the guy wholly interested in sending humanity to the Red Planet to use last year’s opportunity and at least send some small probe? Three missions went to Mars in 2020 and none of them had anything to do with Musk.’

The Boring Company? ‘Hyperloop is dead on arrival. The Las Vegas tunnel is a joke.’

Full Self-Driving (FSD)? (This is an upgrade on Autopilot with several extra features that require even less input from the driver.) ‘FSD is the biggest vaporware [technology that has been advertised but hasn’t been properly developed] in the history of mankind. Six years after sales started, it’s nowhere near functional and will never be functional because the entire approach is flawed. This is my particular area of expertise and I’m 100 per cent sure of what I’m saying here. Their struggles in FSD are exactly like I predicted, and they have no clue how to get over the currently, completely unsafe state of the art. All the claims about cars having sufficient hardware for FSD were a criminal level bluff.’

The solar roof? ‘Dead. Perhaps because it was never about having the tiles, as it was more about having a safe and non-fire-hazard connectivity. Also, it makes zero sense to put solar panels on shaded parts of the roof since they essentially don’t produce any energy at all.’

Neuralink? ‘This is a total scam. Let’s just say I know that from a friend of a friend who happens to be working there. But even without that, I’ve had enough experience in neuroscience to know with certainty that their claims are complete fantasy.’ (He didn’t name the friend.)

Tesla? ‘Clearly Tesla is nothing about cars as much as it is about stock price. The cars just seem to be a nice prop to keep the story going.’

Piekniewski presents a damning assessment of every one of Musk’s companies, ventures and ideas: ‘Really, the only thing this guy does is launching those rockets, and perhaps the real genius of his is to realise what the Cold War era governments realised too: rockets are more a tool of propaganda than they are a tool of space exploration.’

The reason I chose to quote Piekniewski at such length is that it reveals a common theme. Musk has his zealous fan base, and his equally zealous critics. Whether it’s due to his great wealth, his perceived arrogance or the fact that he’s doing what so many have talked about but never tried, a common response seems to be to either declare him the saviour of humanity or immediately discredit him as a charlatan, rather than adopt a more moderate approach to him and his ideas.

But while the business world and venture capitalists view Musk as having the Midas touch and are more than willing to take a gamble on him, the likes of Piekniewski remain unimpressed: ‘In the department of propaganda, memes and market pumps, I think he is a truly one-of-a-kind genius and certainly will make the history books. Just not in the chapter most people expect. The rocket story gives credibility, serves to shut down skeptics and keep all the other balls in the air. But rockets could not save the Soviet Union and eventually they won’t be able to save Elon.’

Musk could well come to represent the most audacious experiment in our modern culture’s pervasive cult of personality.
