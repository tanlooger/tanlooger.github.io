title: A Strange Child
---




UNDER a bright-blue South African sky, a five-year-old Elon Musk stands on the brown-slate stoep (verandah) with his younger sister, Tosca, and brother, Kimbal. From beneath a neatly cut crop of light-brown hair, his broad smile pushes his cheeks up and his eyes are almost closed. It is the smile of a young boy seemingly in his element. A young boy wearing a yellow jersey dirtied by a game of cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers, by the look of the plastic pistol in his right hand.

The year is 1976, a year when most white South African children still played outside with the directive from their parents to come home when the street lights went on, and driven by whatever their imaginations could dream up. Television had only just arrived in South Africa, and in January of that year the South African Broadcasting Corporation officially opened its television service nationwide to those who could afford this new technology. For a child, one of the only offerings was a weekly Afrikaans show called Haas Das se Nuuskas, in which a range of puppet animals, led by the rabbit Haas, would read the news about Diereland (Animal Land). Haas was voiced by the inimitable Riaan Cruywagen, for decades the country’s most trusted television newscaster.

For a youngster like Elon Musk, it was a sheltered world. A world of big gardens in quiet suburbs, and a rabbit on the television who read the news. But he didn’t read the real news. While Musk and his siblings were running around in their garden with toy guns, black children were being shot at with real guns in the Soweto student uprising of June 1976. The frustration of black learners, angered by the government’s provision of second-rate education and by having to learn in Afrikaans, boiled over and they streamed out of their classes into the dusty streets of Soweto on a winter Wednesday morning.

By 9 am as many as 10 000 students were protesting, and police blocked their progress.1 About half an hour later the shooting started. Two teenage boys, one the 12-year-old Hector Pieterson, were the first to die. By evening the fighting still continued. The majority of the dead were under the age of 23. The Rand Daily Mail reported 54 fatalities and close to 200 injured: Petrus Gule, 15, was shot in the head; Samuel Mhlanga, 17, died from a fractured skull; Martin Tshabalala, 17, was shot through the intestine; and Robert Tyiki, 15, was shot in the heart.2 As the uprising spread to other parts of the country, children as young as five were among the casualties.

About 60 km away from Soweto, in Pretoria, white children sat in front of their parents’ television sets to watch a rabbit read the news.

But he mentioned nothing about the children in Soweto.

At the age of five, Elon Musk already knew he was different. He was certainly different to the vast majority of black children in the country by the accident of his birth. But amid the explosion of gunshots and teargas that rattled through South Africa in 1976, Musk was dealing with another kind of explosion that made him feel different in another way.

In his young mind, there was more going on than just the normal development of language and coordination and social communication skills. There was something else. There were ideas. A constant stream of exploding ideas. And questions. And it scared him, to the point that he thought ‘different’ might mean he was actually a little bit crazy: ‘I thought I was insane because it was clear that not everybody’s mind was exploding with ideas all of the time,’ he later recalled. ‘I thought I was kind of like a crazy kid, I suppose. I was just very curious about the world: how did we come to be here, what’s the meaning of life and all of that. I always had a really intense desire to understand things and learn.’3

‘A strange child’ is how Musk has referred to himself. Intense, inquisitive and alone in his own world. But always with a bright smile beneath eyes that from his earliest childhood photos had that same searching intensity as the man who now watches his rockets blast into space.

A strange child indeed, who on Monday 28 June 1971 was born into a ‘strange society’, the heart of which lay in Pretoria, South Africa’s capital city and Musk’s childhood home.

The Pretoria that welcomed baby Musk that day was described by the American journalist Allen Drury as ‘a very strange society’.4 And Pretoria had a strange pull on Musk’s family. The city’s beautiful jacaranda-lined streets had once so captivated Musk’s Canadian grandfather that he moved his entire family from Canada to Pretoria.

It was a strange decision for a man who was a noted free-thinker, and whose grandson would take this to entirely new levels. And yet at the same time it was perfectly understandable, for Pretoria has always had a strange and complex relationship with the history of South Africa. From its beginnings, Pretoria represented the ideals of liberty, freedom and adventure of a new nation, things that appealed to the likes of Musk’s grandfather, but that would come to represent the pinnacle of isolation and conservatism by the time Musk was growing up.

Pretoria was founded with a rebel heart when the Boer general Marthinus Wessel Pretorius rode in with his band of Voortrekkers and chose to camp by the Apies River. After running battles with indigenous groups, the newcomers declared this to be their new home. In 1855, Pretoria officially became the new capital of the South African Republic, taking over from the original capital of Potchefstroom. Its name came from the great Boer general Andries Pretorius – Marthinus’s father. Marthinus Pretorius was the first president of a fiercely independent corner of the subcontinent that would soon see a tremendous scramble for land, minerals and power.

For this band of people, the Great Trek – the migration of Dutch-Afrikaners from the Cape away from British rule – was finally over. And that spirit is forever embedded in the soil of the Pretoria that Elon Musk would have dirtied his boyhood hands in. But he was not an Afrikaner. He did not identify with that conservative culture. He was appalled by the policy of apartheid, which reached a turning point in Soweto in 1976. But if you grew up in Pretoria in the 1970s, it left an indelible mark on you. It shaped you in ways you would not have even noticed. For while Musk may not have directly identified with Afrikaner culture, the spirit of the Voortrekkers, people described as ‘pioneers’ and ‘pathfinders’, and the city they founded would most certainly have resonated – and probably still does – with a man on a pioneering quest of his own.

Pretoria was the home of the poet and writer Eugène Marais, of the writer, artist and activist Es’kia Mphahlele, and the sculptor and artist Anton van Wouw. These are just a few of the inquiring minds that have lived here.

And on Monday 28 June 1971, it became the home of Elon Musk.

In 1971, South Africa was at the height of apartheid, the policy of racial separation that had existed since 1948. Eleven years earlier, the African National Congress (ANC) and other liberation organisations had been banned by the ruling National Party government. A decade before Musk’s birth, South Africa had become a republic and withdrawn from the Commonwealth. In 1964, it was banned from the Olympics. Seven years before Musk’s birth, Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists had been sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island.

By 1971, South Africa had become an island in the Western world, isolated by its racial politics. And yet, for the country’s white hospitals, it was a significant year. It was certainly a good year for sporting births, with Lance Klusener (cricket), Joost van der Westhuizen, Jannie de Beer and Pieter Rossouw (rugby), and Amanda Coetzer and Wayne Ferreira (tennis) among the future sports stars born in 1971. Klusener would go on to make his Test debut for South Africa just five years after the country was readmitted to international cricket and would begin to bridge the two worlds between white and black in South Africa as a white sportsman fluent in Zulu, which earned him the nickname ‘Zulu’. Van der Westhuizen would go on to play for the Springboks and be part of that iconic team that won the 1995 Rugby World Cup in Johannesburg, and which brought a nation together under the vision of the country’s first black president, Nelson Mandela. The sports stars born that year would form part of a period in which South Africa sought to use its sporting prowess to galvanise the new Rainbow Nation while at the same time flexing the muscles of its return to the international fold. They were the bridge between two worlds.

But there was nothing to suggest that the baby boy born to Errol Musk, a highly successful mechanical engineer, and Maye Musk, a beautiful model and dietitian, on that Monday in June 1971 would emerge as one of the greatest entrepreneurs, engineers, inventors and innovators the world has ever seen. Nor that he would go on to bridge worlds of his own fantastic imagination. Or that Pretoria would one day lay claim to being the cradle of the richest man on planet Earth. A man who would single-handedly redirect public thinking back to space exploration and the conservation of not only the planet but its most dominant species – human beings. A man who by virtue of his mother’s work ethic, borne of the hardships she would undergo, and his father’s ruthless drive and determination would seek to bring value to society in everything he undertook. Yet also a man of polarising opinions surrounded by controversy and critics. His audacious takeover bid in 2022 for Twitter, for instance, was greeted with glee in some quarters and fear and loathing in others.

His mother would help to frame his vision and view of success when she told him, ‘Being successful is what you can share with other people to make them feel good.’

Musk would later define this as ‘What are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? There need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning. You wake up in the morning and you look forward to the day … look forward to the future.’5

In 1971, in Pretoria, the future was uncertain.
