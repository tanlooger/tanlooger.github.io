title: Broken Home
---




MAYE Haldeman was at the lowest point of her 21-year-old life when her former boyfriend Errol knocked on the door of her Cape Town home. He was the last person she expected to see, and the engagement ring he offered her was also the last thing she ever expected from a man she’d shut out of her life.

And now here he stood, at a time in her life when she was questioning everything about herself.

After growing up in an English household, Maye had struggled through a degree in dietetics at the University of Pretoria which was only offered in Afrikaans. She had started a relationship with Errol Musk, but it had been a rocky one and she had broken it off. At the same time, her modelling career – though never her main focus – had started to take off. She won the Vaal Queen competition in 1969, and to this she added Miss LM Radio, and she was also a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa pageant, losing out to Linda Collett.

Maye was a stunningly beautiful young woman, and the Haldeman twins were certainly the talk of Pretoria society. But at the age of 21, the stress of her studies, the difficulty of finding a job and the challenges of her relationship with Errol saw her develop an eating disorder. When she finally secured her first job as a nutritional expert with a food company in Cape Town and had to give lectures to nurses about infant feeding, Maye weighed 93 kg.

Her relationship with Errol was over, in her mind at least.

‘I was lonely – alone in Cape Town. I wasn’t in a happy situation,’1 she said in a CBS interview in August 2020. And that’s when Errol came knocking. ‘For two years I didn’t see him and the next thing he turned up in Cape Town with an engagement ring.’2

Out of the blue, Errol proposed. Maye immediately turned him down. But, according to her, Errol went back to Pretoria and to her parents with the message that she had agreed to his proposal. They were surprised, as they were well aware of his turbulent relationship with their daughter. After sending Maye a telegram of congratulations, they suggested a double wedding with her twin sister, Kaye, who was about to marry her long-time boyfriend. As Maye recalls, before she even had time to comprehend what was happening, invitations had been sent out to 800 guests for the double wedding of the Haldeman twins.

It was a strange time for Maye, and indeed a difficult moment to comprehend, as she explains how she was basically cajoled into a wedding. According to Maye, much of this had to do with the limited telecommunications of the day. Telegrams were standard, and long-distance phone calls (even between Pretoria and Cape Town) were expensive and considered a luxury. The more time that passed between her turning down Errol and his telling an entirely different story to her parents, the more her initial refusal was drowned out by the impending wedding and the wave of well-intended goodwill that went with it. Conflicted between not wanting to marry Errol, wedding plans that were already in the making and a desire not to upset her parents, Maye relented. Weighed down by her low self-esteem and physically at one of the lowest points in her life, with back and knee pain as a result of her weight gain, it appears that Maye simply didn’t have the energy but to go along with the plans that had been made for her, and the future that had been decided on her behalf: ‘He sure timed it right. I was lonely, and I had thrown out my back and was in pain. I did not have any confidence because of all the weight I had gained. I hated the way that I looked, and I thought that no man would want to date me.’3 Maye admitted: ‘I wasn’t attracted to him, but he was persistent.’4

Her parents sent her a telegram instructing her to quit her job and return home to Pretoria to prepare for the wedding. She honoured her parents’ wishes, as many young women of the 1970s would have done. And in 1970, Maye married Errol Musk, an electrical and mechanical engineer who also lived in Pretoria. ‘I thought,’ she later recalled, “well, what can be worse? Marriage can’t be that bad.”5

‘Then came the years when my life was hell. It’s not a time in my life that I like to talk about, because it is so painful. It makes me angry and bitter. That is not what I want to be. After I talk about it, I toss and turn at night. I can’t sleep.’6

It is a difficult time in the Musk family history, a time that is still shrouded in controversy and conflict. Errol has his version of events, and Maye her own. And Elon is vehement about the man he believes his father to be, going so far as to call him a ‘psychopath’. Maye prefers to frame it as nine years of hell, but which resulted in three beautiful children whom she remains close to.

As she tells it, her marriage to Errol was indeed hell from the start. The slightest thing seemed to upset him. On their wedding day, Maye recalls, Errol was furious that their wedding was overshadowed by the happiness of her sister and her husband, and that they were somehow forced to play second fiddle on this occasion. Then, on their honeymoon, Maye said, they used her savings to fly to Europe, and she did all the unpacking while Errol sat on a couch reading a Playboy magazine.

According to Maye, Errol was highly unstable. He would call her dumb and ugly. He would insult her in front of dinner guests, and if they never returned he would blame it on her inferior cooking skills.

‘He was cruel in ways that didn’t make sense,’7 she said. In the same CBS interview in August 2020, Maye said, ‘When I was married I was told about three times a day that I’m boring and stupid and ugly.’8

Perhaps the only thing they had in common was planes. Like Joshua Haldeman, Errol had bought his own plane. But even this brought with it painful memories. While pregnant with Elon, Maye recalls how she helped Errol paint his plane. But he would complain to her if she slowed down because of her pregnancy. ‘You’re just being lazy and weak,’9 he reportedly told her.

She remembers how he even complained to a nurse in hospital about how uncomfortable he was while she was giving birth. The nurse told him to rub his wife’s back to help ease the pain of her birth. ‘What do you mean? She should rub my back,’10 he shouted.

And when her father died in a plane crash, she said, Errol’s response was to ask how much money they would receive. She said he was incensed that it would all go to her mother, and he banned her from seeing her family for two years. When her mother phoned her in secret, he would accuse her of speaking to another man.

The marriage lasted nine years.

Musk has spoken more openly about his father, but still without giving too many details as to the actual scale of the alleged abuse. He has referred to his father as ‘pure evil’. In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Musk said, ‘It was not a happy childhood. My father has serious issues.’11

He expanded on this in a wide-ranging 2017 interview with Rolling Stone magazine: ‘He was such a terrible human being … You have no idea. My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil … It’s so terrible you can’t believe it. In my experience there is nothing you can do. Nothing. Nothing. I wish. I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he … no way, it just got worse.’12

It has been widely reported that Errol once shot and killed three intruders on his plot in Lonehill, Johannesburg. The sad reality for South Africans is that this would not constitute an act of evil so much as an act of self-defence, which Errol later said is why he was acquitted of any charges.

Errol corroborated this story in a series of posts on his personal Facebook page. Errol had a surprisingly active period on Facebook, where he seemed to reminisce quite freely about a number of elements in his life. And then at other times, as you trawled through his feed, you would find posts supporting conspiracy theories around anything from 9/11 to aliens building the pyramids and COVID-19 vaccines. The comments to his Facebook posts were often the most illuminating as long-lost friends kept contact and recalled favourite memories. And it was in one such series of comments that Errol corresponded with his childhood friend Bobby Snodgrass.

Errol wrote: ‘You [Bobby] have always been there for me. Especially when I arrived in Villieria [an Afrikaans suburb in Pretoria] and we had to contend with the vicious Dutchmen [South African slang for Afrikaners]. You showed me how. I was very innocent and completely unprepared … The things I learned there helped me defend myself and my daughter from six gunmen who broke in … Fifty-two shots at me (the shells were counted by the police), two from me. Three dead. The Snodgrass way!’13

There is one element of Errol’s lifestyle that is a common theme, and that all who know him agree upon. ‘Errol started succumbing to the allure of girls from about Standard 5 [Grade 7], so our jaunts to the local creek and kleilat [a game played with reed sticks and mud balls] fights came to an abrupt halt,’ Snodgrass said in my personal correspondence with him. He and Errol have been friends since childhood.

‘We lived a few houses apart in the same Pretoria suburb. I was also friendly with Maye. As primary school kids, we got up to all sorts of mischief. There were about three girls in the vicinity of our residence who caught Errol’s eye, and he once told me he would prefer to have a girlfriend from the neighbourhood as well as one from school who was from another suburb.’

In an interview with Britain’s Mail on Sunday, Errol admitted his mistakes: ‘I had a very pretty wife, but there were always prettier, younger girls. I really loved Maye, but I screwed up.’14

It appears that this ultimately caused the rift between him and Elon. And when Errol later fathered a child with his stepdaughter, Jana Bezuidenhout, the entire family seemed to cut him off.

Snodgrass confronted Errol on his relationship with his stepdaughter: ‘I exchanged quite a few messages castigating him on crossing the line of “incest”, but he convinced me that it was quite acceptable.’

In response to a Facebook message from Snodgrass about this, Errol wrote back: ‘I was married to her mother for two years from 1992 to 1994. Her mother remarried several times so there must be several stepfathers. I only saw Jana for the first time in about 2015, after about ten years … when she contacted me and asked for help as she and her boyfriend were “desperate” and she was contemplating the worst. I helped from then on but saw very little of her as they lived far away. Only when her boyfriend threw her out of his rented room onto the street, with her belongings, did I suggest she come here. She stayed for about four days before her boyfriend begged her to return. But without sounding trite, it takes two to tango.’15

The story of Errol Musk is filled with controversy, intrigue and, depending on who you speak to, a substantial amount of myth. Following Musk’s revelations about his father in Rolling Stone, and on being asked for comment by the writer, Errol emailed the following response: ‘I’ve been accused of being a Gay, a Misogynist, a Paedophile, a Traitor, a Rat, a Shit (quite often), a Bastard (by many women whose attentions I did not return) and much more. My own (wonderful) mother told me I am “ruthless” and should learn to be more “humane”. But I love my children and would readily do whatever for them.’16 Maye, though, has a different recollection of Errol’s mother, who she says actively encouraged his hurtful nature.

Those who knew Errol in his younger days paint the picture of a highly intelligent and successful man with obvious flaws. But a man unique in every sense, much like his son Elon. ‘Errol’s parents, Jock and Cora, smoked heavily. And Jock drank like a fish. He was a functional alcoholic,’ recalled Snodgrass in our correspondence. ‘His mother was the smart one. Michael, his younger brother by five years, never took to drink or cigarettes. Michael is still my dermatologist, and during our annual mole patrols and reminiscences of yesteryear’s pranks and frivolities, we always come to the same conclusion about Errol’s massive IQ and depleted EQ.’

Errol’s IQ was certainly never in question and found its outlet in both business and politics. Errol was politically active in the Pretoria community as an opponent of apartheid and a member of the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), the forerunner of today’s Democratic Alliance. At the age of 25 he was elected as a city councillor for Sunnyside, the youngest at the time. ‘This made me the first progressive English-speaking Pretoria city councillor in 24 years, and the first person to run a successful campaign and win against the apartheid National Party government at that time,’17 Errol wrote on his Facebook page.

He recalled how John Vorster, who on the day of Elon’s birth was appealing to Afrikaans students at the University of Pretoria to apply their minds to a race solution for South Africa, used to call him ‘Boet’ (Brother), while PW Botha addressed him as ‘Geagte mnr. Musk’ (Dear Mr Musk).

‘I was active in opposing the Nationalist Party and their apartheid. I did not run away. I made an effort and an attempt to address change as best as I could. Not only did I attempt to enter the political spectrum to try and change the status quo, I actually successfully ran for other positions and was elected. Sadly, it was always a David and Goliath situation at the time. But it clearly demonstrates my views and a desire to change South Africa. Please appreciate that in those days opposition to the apartheid regime was done at considerable risk to me and my family.’18

It was during this time of political activity that Pierre Viljoen first crossed paths with Errol Musk: ‘It was in the mid-Seventies. I was friendly with Hansie Steyn, the owner of the famous Steyn’s Garage in Pretoria. They were also a very prominent Pretoria business family. Hansie hosted a dinner for Errol at his home in The Willows. He said Errol had just become the youngest city councillor, and he invited me to join them. That’s where I first met Errol.’

According to Viljoen, there was nothing obviously untoward about the man he met: ‘He was a bright guy and was doing well. He’d married into the Haldeman family. Errol said to me he knew very few people socially because he worked so hard. I invited Errol to a social occasion at my house and we became friendly, but only on a social basis.

‘I never had any business dealings with him. I’ve subsequently heard all these stories about him, and I suppose people put their best foot forward in a social setting, but I found him to be a fairly happy and social guy. He loved a party … He never spoke about why his marriage broke down. But he was fond of the ladies. Errol was full of life. He was a forceful sort of guy in that one had the feeling that he was a go-getter. He wasn’t shy to talk about his successes. He had many business interests.’

Errol’s business success coincided with the ‘golden’ years in Pretoria, and indeed South Africa. Golden years that were quite literally carried by the gold the country’s mines produced. In the 1970s, South Africa was the world’s leading producer of gold, and it accounted for over 21 per cent of the country’s GDP.

‘It was after World War II, and the Sixties and Seventies were the golden years of the country then. Of course, that’s if you were a privileged white family. The war was over, the economy was booming, the gold price was good, farming was good, and things were developing,’ says Viljoen. There was a wave of optimism and success, and Pretoria’s social scene was buzzing. For a successful young businessman with political ambitions such as Errol Musk, it was the perfect environment in which to see and be seen.

Snodgrass also remembers Errol as a gifted man who was a tremendous success. As he posted in a series of messages on Errol’s Facebook page, ‘Errol became hugely successful because he was a brilliant engineer. Elon was fortunate to have inherited Errol’s gifted genes and became even more successful. If ever there was a family that made the world a better place for everyone then it must be the Musks … Elon has a great imagination, just like his dad; growing up with Errol was like being on another planet. As kids we were just not smart enough to separate Errol’s facts from his fiction. Elon obviously, like the proverbial apple, takes after his father. Having said that, if it wasn’t for his unrealistic imagination I very much doubt whether he could have achieved what he has accomplished so far, and I am sure he will put someone on Mars in our lifetime … I grew up with Errol and became very frustrated when as kids he would talk about aliens and spaceships rather than joining us in a game of soccer or cricket … Indeed Errol is a wise father. He inculcated, both genetically and by example, the gift of imagination in Elon’s DNA. Everything Elon has accomplished bears some of Errol’s genes and influence.’19

There is no doubt that the children of Errol and Maye Musk enjoyed a privileged childhood in Pretoria in those years, although Errol baulks at the suggestion that Elon in particular owes his success to this. According to Errol, his own opposition to apartheid and Elon’s decision leave South Africa at 17 for Canada is enough indication that the family did not directly benefit from the apartheid system.

Responding to an article on the website Business Insider on 28 February 2021, which he said was factually incorrect, Errol wrote: ‘I believe this [Elon’s decision to leave South Africa] is a clear indication of his willingness to not support the political suppression in the country. Let me add that for a young man aged 17 to make this decision may sound easy and simple but it was not, and yet he stuck to his guns. What is factual is that both my sons refused to serve in the legislated mandatory military service of South Africa as we all deemed this to be inappropriate.’20

One of the many stories that swirl around Errol refers to his alleged ownership of an emerald mine in Zambia, which has been said to be a contributing factor to Elon’s success. Errol admits that, for a time, he did own a share in a Zambian emerald mine. But, according to him, this lasted for about five years: ‘Initially the trade was fairly good, but it collapsed in 1989 when Russia began producing perfect lab emeralds at one tenth the price. Income from this source consequently abruptly died.’21

But he rejects any suggestion that Elon benefited either from this brief business partnership in Zambia or from being a white South African under apartheid: ‘Neither was it [the emerald mine] beneficial to Elon’s success in the USA, starting in about 1999 … It is necessary to acknowledge the wrong and oppressive nature of apartheid and we do need to recognise the pain and suffering it caused for many South Africans, but I do not feel it is fair to associate any of that with what Elon has achieved through hard work since he left South African shores as a teenager of 17.’22

Yet it’s obvious that the very nature of being white and of means in South Africa at that time was privilege enough.

But the fact that he was somehow given a fast track to success is something that clearly rankles with Elon. The emerald-mine story, and the fact that it keeps coming up in almost any biographical material about him, is a particular source of frustration for him. It first surfaced in a Business Insider article in 2018. Elon has directly spoken out about it, particularly the insinuation that the mine was an ‘apartheid deal’ that he somehow benefited from.

Again, there is only Errol’s version of events to even suggest the mine existed in the first place, although his response to Business Insider was corroborated by Pieter van Niekerk, who said he was a partner with Errol in a consulting engineering business in Pretoria. ‘Everything he states in this article is correct,’ Van Niekerk wrote on Errol’s Facebook page.23

Intrigued by the controversy, American journalist Jeremy Arnold has pursued the story. Arnold was on a crusade of his own that strangely intersected with the world of Elon Musk. Musk has long had a negative perception of journalists, fuelled largely by what he believes is the media’s lack of proper research and fact-checking. As a result of his experiences with the media, Musk has even gone so far as to suggest that he would like to establish some form of media accountability . Some of Musk’s companies, surprisingly, do not even have a PR department. In a world of traditional CEOs, Musk is that rarest of individuals, one who handles most of the media himself. He controls the narrative. He decides when to speak and when not to. And most often, he will do so not through press releases or media launches but through Twitter. Even trying to get hold of him for an interview is an almost impossible task.

As a journalist, Arnold shares a similar concern for the role journalism and journalists are playing in this new world where more people than ever in history have access to information. And the quality of that information is a concern. Arnold has spent several years showcasing examples of what he calls ‘bad explanations’ by the media. And he has focused exclusively on the mainstream media, the sources people are told to trust implicitly – from the BBC to The New York Times. Arnold has made it his personal mission to correct this. He picks the biggest media outlets because they are the most public, and he believes that if he can show the errors or inconsistencies in their reporting, there is a greater chance of something being done to improve the situation.

So with outlets such as The Independent newspaper in the UK, Forbes magazine and many others continuing to perpetuate the emerald mine story that originated in Business Insider, Arnold went to the source – Errol himself. The result was a long-form article24 that corrected several inaccuracies around the story, and to which Elon himself tweeted a link. He was sick of hearing that his fortune was built on the back of apartheid and mining rights in Africa.

I contacted Arnold directly, and he was happy for his investigation to be reproduced here: ‘Errol had, in his own words, very limited involvement. From the way he put it to me, it was a handshake deal with a Panamanian man that resulted in something like 110 emeralds up front and then a semi-regular trickle of rough stones over a few years following. There was never formal ownership.’25 From Arnold’s research, there is no paperwork to corroborate any of this: ‘Errol said the man in question passed away in 2019.’26

Elon has called all of Arnold’s research accurate. Arnold even spoke to one of Elon’s college roommates, Adeo Ressi, to try and get a sense of whether there was any truth to the suggestion that Musk’s success was the product of a silver-spoon family background and that he rode this to the top. According to Arnold, ‘the unanimous testimony I got (which fits with the public record) was that Elon was painfully thrifty and had a high appetite for unglamorous work. And I don’t take these to be common qualities among those reliant on their family wealth.’27

Yet Errol’s success, and the possible launchpad it provided for his son Elon, would always be an easy target. According to Errol, he at one point owned six houses in the wealthy Pretoria suburb of Waterkloof Ridge, from Victoria Street down to Julius Jeppe. This neighbourhood has always been among the wealthiest and a haven of old money. It is a suburb of mansions with vast gardens behind high walls. Its streets bear the names of British royalty and the wealthy pioneers who helped found and develop modern Pretoria, and are home to diplomats, business leaders and local celebrities. It boasts some of Pretoria’s most expensive real estate, and Errol’s claim that he once owned several houses here would be an indication of the kind of wealth he had: ‘I rented to embassies as the houses were all in “Embassy Lane”. In total I had six houses in Waterkloof proper. The house Maye and I lived in, and where Elon and the kids grew up, is now the headquarters of the United Nations for the Southern Hemisphere (in Victoria Street).’28

Errol’s three children have all become wildly successful. Tosca, the youngest, is a filmmaker and cofounder of Passionflix, a streaming platform and production company specialising in romance movies. Kimbal, two years older than Tosca, is a chef and restaurateur who is leading a crusade to change the way Americans eat through increased access to ‘real food’ and the construction of Learning Garden classrooms in schools throughout the United States. And then there is Elon, the oldest. The richest human on Earth. And a man now devoted to making humans an interplanetary species.

For all his own success, Elon has been dogged by claims that he benefited greatly from his father’s wealth, although no real evidence of this exists. He claims he received no financial support from his father whatsoever when he left South Africa. Yet Errol has claimed to have provided the seed capital for Elon’s first company, Zip2.

Elon does indeed have a complicated relationship with money, which perhaps explains his frustration and often angry outbursts that nothing but his own hard work and determination brought him the fabulous wealth and success he now enjoys. He claims not to be motivated by money at all, living a fairly simple life and not indulging in any personal excesses. Most of his fortune he ploughs back into other companies and projects. His clothes are often just a simple black T-shirt and black denim, or a plain black suit. There is the occasional purchase of an expensive car, but even here he seems more motivated by the uniqueness of the vehicle than simply buying the best on the market, such as when he bought on auction the Lotus Esprit that featured in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. In October 2021, infuriated by the US’s complex corporate tax structure and by insinuations that billionaires such as himself are benefiting improperly from unrealised gains and using these as a means of tax avoidance, Musk did what he does best: he launched a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell a chunk of his Tesla stock. With a slight majority voting ‘yes’, Musk followed through and sold ten per cent of his stock, purportedly to make a point to the legislators. He tweeted that much was being made of ‘unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance’.

In those early years in Pretoria, though, his father was more focused on building his wealth than in finding ways to get rid of it. As a mechanical engineer, Errol had a similarly pragmatic approach to raising his children. He viewed Tosca, Kimbal and Elon through the lens of project management. Errol reflected, once again on his Facebook page: ‘In some ways my children were projects and my job was to complete the project in the best way possible. One issue that was tantamount in my approach to my children: your brother(s) and/or sister(s) is the closest person you will ever have in your life, so never ever alienate one another. Rather cut off your right arm first. I had seen how in so many families this was not the case and the terrible results that came of it.’29

To illustrate his point, Errol makes a claim that Elon has subsequently denied: ‘When I sent money for Zip2 I insisted that Elon include Kimbal in any venture. To do this Elon actually gave up one year, but used it wisely to obtain a second degree at UPenn [University of Pennsylvania]. The results speak for themselves.’30

According to Elon, ‘He [my dad] was irrelevant. He paid nothing for college. My brother and I paid for college through scholarships, loans and working two jobs simultaneously. The funding we raised for our first company came from a small group of random angel investors in Silicon Valley … He [my dad] said rather contentiously that I’d be back in three months, that I’m never going to make it, that I’m never going to make anything of myself. He called me an idiot all the time. That’s the tip of the iceberg, by the way.’31

Yet something in his father’s words did hit home. Kimbal is a board member for two of Elon’s biggest companies, Tesla and SpaceX. And for all the conflict between father and son, Errol spent possibly the most time with Elon. After the divorce, Maye and the three children initially moved into their Durban holiday home. Errol moved to his smallholding in Lonehill. She then moved the family to Bloemfontein, where she had a dietetic internship at a local hospital.

But it was at this point that Elon made a curious decision. Sparked by what he said were feelings of sorrow for his father, he decided to go and live with Errol in Johannesburg. According to Maye, they were all living in a one-bedroom flat in Bloemfontein at the time Elon left to join his father: ‘Kimbal and Tosca slept in the bedroom and I slept in the living room/kitchen. It was the doctor’s quarters. I stayed there while I worked in the hospital and completed my studies.’32

Maye said she met another man after her divorce. This too was a strange relationship for her. From the moment they met, she says, he was determined to marry her. They became engaged, and then he made another model pregnant. The couple actually moved in next door to Maye.

Asked in the CBS interview in 2020 why Elon left, Maye said: ‘Elon went to live with his father when he was ten because Errol had two encyclopaedias, and then he got a computer. That was something I could never afford. Then at the age of 13, Kimbal went to live with them as well because he was missing his brother. I had them every weekend. I’d pick them up on Friday afternoon and take them back every Sunday night. Tosca didn’t want to live with her father at all. I tried to let her stay weekends there, but then she’d call me crying and I’d go and pick her up.’33

Elon has since said it was a decision he regrets.

Based upon the many varied and sometimes contradictory views of Errol, the constant seems to be a highly intelligent man driven to succeed at any cost, a man who would belittle those he deemed inferior to him and a serial philanderer.

In my personal correspondence with Bobby Snodgrass, he said: ‘Errol has many psychological flaws. I’m schooled in economics and business so human behaviour is part of the curriculum. However, my wife did clinical psychology. While Errol was serving contractual time at Eskom, who gave him a bursary to study electrical engineering at the University of Pretoria, he was a regular visitor to our home. My wife detested his presence … On the flip side, he has an IQ of 140 with a strong listing towards the natural sciences. He continually reminded you how stupid you are. His brother Michael was regularly called an idiot. Once, when we compared our maths results in Standard 5 [Grade 7], he always scored in the nineties and I was lucky to get in the fifties. He remarked how close I was to failing and asked me how it felt to be stupid. As a child it hurt, but we remained friends because his flip side could be very charming. I went on to graduate in economics and later did a master’s cum laude from the prestigious University of Liverpool. The point is, I wasn’t that stupid.

‘As kids I was physically stronger and more athletic than Errol, who was not fat but definitely chubby and slow out of the starting blocks in track events. He was also smart enough to avoid being on the receiving end of my left jab.’

Speculating about how the break in the relationship between Errol and Elon occurred, Snodgrass said: ‘Elon, as a youngster, was a sensitive and bright boy and showed much independence from the age of four. When Maye left and the two boys stayed with Errol, Errol’s negative influence took its toll. I believe Elon when he says that nothing he did was good enough in the eyes of his father.’

While it may have been a financially secure childhood, Musk is adamant that ‘I did not have a good childhood. It was not happy.’

Apparently deprived of any real love and affection from his father, he retreated into his own world of encyclopaedias and science fiction. Inwardly, he was growing beyond comprehension with a vision and imagination that had no borders. But outwardly, he was awkward and a loner – a ‘strange child’.

As a child he often told himself, ‘I never want to be alone.’ Yet many of his peers at school described him as a loner.

In fact, it was the sight of a lonely Elon Musk at his new school that made him his first real childhood friend.
