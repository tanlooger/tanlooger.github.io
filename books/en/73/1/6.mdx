IN 2013, Elon Musk graced the cover of Time magazine as one of ‘The 100 Most Influential People in the World’. On 15 May 2013, Bryanston High School issued a post on Facebook congratulating Musk: ‘Congratulations to past Bryanstonian, Elon Musk, on making the Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World list (and cover) for 2013.’

As proud as the school was of one of its former pupils, Musk’s memories of his time at Bryanston High School are hardly pleasurable.

That morning in January 1984, when Danny Warnick remembers Musk being dropped off at Bryanston High to begin Grade 8 [Standard 6], began a period in his young life that was not only one of his most harrowing but also very nearly killed him.

The awkward, shy, geeky-looking kid was now no longer just a passing amusement and slight oddity. In a culture and environment that turned a blind eye to bullying as simply ‘boys being boys’ or a rite of passage towards manhood, Musk became a target. He was bullied relentlessly and viciously. Being younger than many of his peers didn’t exactly help: ‘I was almost beaten to death, if you would call that bullied,’ he said in a 60 Minutes interview.1

Former students of Bryanston High School from that era have spoken out on social media about the out-of-control culture of bullying that existed at the school. Many have mentioned by name gangs of individuals who prowled the hallways; for those who suffered at their hands, the physical scars may have been temporary, but the emotional scars have lasted a lifetime.

Some saw it as simply a part of growing up, something to be endured, and something as much a part of the fabric of the school system as homework or teachers shouting. Others dismissed it as ‘Africa is not for sissies’. But for Musk, it quite literally was a matter of survival, as he was mercilessly targeted by a gang of bullies: ‘For the longest time, I was the youngest and the smallest kid in the class because my birthday just happens to fall on almost the last day that they will accept you into school, June 28th. And I was a late bloomer. So, I was the youngest and the smallest kid in class for years and years. The gangs at school would hunt me down – literally hunt me down,’2 he said.

The worst beating he ever suffered put him in hospital. While sitting at the top of a flight of stairs, he was kicked in the head by a group of seniors. As he tumbled to the bottom, the bullies set on him there as well. Musk was beaten so badly he had to be taken to the Sandton Mediclinic.

Errol confirmed this in a note to the South African financial journalist Alec Hogg. When he read of what Elon had suffered, Hogg wrote an article about the experiences of his own son, Travis, with bullies: ‘My late son Travis, similar to the schoolboy Elon Musk in many ways, was also bullied mercilessly at school. Too smart for his own wellbeing, he often suffered the consequences of a quick mouth and late developing body. His mother was so incensed she gave one of the bullies a clout. But even that didn’t help. But as tough a time as Travis had of it, Elon Musk’s Bryanston bullies set new levels of schoolyard brutality.’3

Errol’s note to Hogg described how Elon ‘was so injured I never recognised him at Sandton Clinic. He was in hospital for two weeks. I laid a charge of assault but the Randburg police declined to prosecute saying it was just “skoolseuns wat rondspeel” (schoolboy high-jinks). The school itself was non-committal. Elon was 12. I removed him immediately, driving at first daily to Pretoria Boys High.’4

The emotional effect of the bullying was obviously long-lasting. But even on a physical level, it left its mark on the future billionaire. In 2013, Errol wrote on Facebook: ‘Elon has recently had corrective surgery inside his nose from being beaten up as a kid at school in the Old South Africa. Elon always gave as good as he got but in the Old South Africa things were rough among whites and NO ONE fought fair. Two held you down while another pommelled your face with a log and so on. New boys were forced to fight the school thug on their first day at a new school. The hatred was endemic.

‘Among “adults” a polite glance at someone when entering a bar (if you were stupid enough to go into a bar, which were “men only” then) could get you three days in intensive care. Make that three months if your glance was remotely arrogant. Anybody doubt me on this? Then you weren’t here.’5

It seems that, in this instance, Musk and Errol have much in common. Errol has recounted how he too was bullied at school: ‘I also went to Rietondale [High School in Pretoria], after Hamilton [Primary School, also in Pretoria]. Hamilton in town before that was a nightmare for six months. I came out from England at the time. I’m still looking for Malcolm Watt. Please contact me if you read this, Malcolm. I owe you a broken nose, maybe a bit more. Rietondale was one of the worst of all with the Fishbachs, the Stoltzes and the Larks. I had to fight John Fishbach on my first day there, ten rounds. I was beaten to shit. Hey, I wore sandals. All English kids did. They beat me for that, p....d in my bag and books. Next time I saw Fishbach he was lying drunk in a gutter in Durban. He asked me for sixpence to help him out.’6

Errol summed up the way to survive as ‘Look down, don’t stand out, you know.’7

When a reader questioned him about the Facebook post, he responded: ‘As for the bars in the Sixties. Hey, I was at the Plaza with my friends when someone kicked a guy called Joe to death outside in the queue. You were not there. Elon went to school in the Eighties. He was in hospital for two weeks, beaten to within an inch at Bryanston. Get real.’8

What Errol describes of his school years in Pretoria certainly resonates. In those years, there were running battles between English and Afrikaans kids. While the country was split by the racial divide between black and white, the whites were further split between English and Afrikaans. As an English boy growing up in an Afrikaans suburb, Errol would have certainly been a target as a ‘Soutie’ or ‘Rooinek’. Pretoria, always a more Afrikaans society, had its own culture wars in this sense. Johannesburg, though, was another world entirely. While separated by less than 65 km of national highway, Pretoria and Johannesburg have always been worlds apart. Johannesburg was more English, but it had its fair share of thugs as well, and the Portuguese, Greek and Lebanese gangs were some of the most feared in the city.

Coming from the largely conservative society of Pretoria to Johannesburg would have been a major adjustment for Musk. Lonehill, where Errol had his plot, is less than ten kilometres away from Bryanston, so it made sense to consider Bryanston High School for Elon.

But as much as Musk was a victim, he didn’t adopt a victim mentality. Musk said he took up karate and learned to defend himself: ‘I started dishing it out as hard as they’d give it to me … It taught me a lesson: If you’re fighting a bully, you cannot appease a bully … You punch the bully in the nose. Bullies are looking for targets that won’t fight back. If you make yourself a hard target and punch the bully in the nose, he’s going to beat the shit out of you, but he’s actually not going to hit you again.’9

Interestingly, this experience seems to have hardened his resolve to do something positive for other people. When he was asked during the Rolling Stone interview what his greatest fear was, he said it was the extinction of human civilisation.10 ‘I’m pro-human. I love humanity. I think it’s great,’ he said when he appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience.11

After the news broke about Musk’s bullying at Bryanston High School, principal John Skelton issued a statement: ‘Initially I felt very sad after reading what had apparently happened to him,’ Skelton told News24.12 ‘The culture of our school is honour, dignity and respect. Every human being is unique and special … Bullying was accepted as a part of growing up and now we know the impact. In the 1990s, people started realising that bullying is a very destructive force.’13 In response, Errol, also speaking to News24, said: ‘South Africa is seen as a jock culture. It might produce intellectual people, but it is not an intellectual culture.’14

When Elon was moved to Pretoria Boys High School, where the discipline was stricter, Errol recalls that the bullying stopped.

Many people have speculated that it is this period in Musk’s life that led to his severing his ties with South Africa. And it has also led to a great misconception regarding Boys High.

It was widely reported that Musk was approached by former headmaster Bill Schroder for funds to help with several new building projects at the school. This was part of a worldwide drive among old boys to fund projects, such as the building of a new school hall, library and computer centre. It was reported that Musk made a R1 million donation, and then requested of Schroder that the school never, ever contact him again.

But Schroder, who was headmaster at the school between 1990 and 2009, said this was incorrect. In a full statement released to the media, Schroder confirmed that Musk had donated R1 million to the school. He confirmed that when he approached Musk for a second time, he again donated funds to the school. But he corrected what he felt was a lie about the former pupil: ‘I was the Headmaster of Pretoria Boys High School from 1990 to 2009 and subsequent to my retirement was asked to head a fundraising exercise over a four-year period. As such, I feel it is important to set the record straight in terms of donations received from Elon Musk, who matriculated at Boys High in 1988.

‘It is true that Elon Musk did, at my request, give a donation for R1 million. What is not true is that he disliked the country or the school so intensely that he told me not to approach him again. I, in fact did, and he sent a second donation per that request. I lost contact with him for a while as he changed PAs and on re-establishing contact, a new network for consideration of donations had been put in place and it must be understood that people with that amount of wealth have teams of people who deal with huge numbers of requests for donations. At that point we received nothing further from him.

‘It is well documented in a number of biographies that Elon was bullied and an unhappy schoolboy in a school in Johannesburg and was moved to Pretoria Boys High in Grade 10 (Standard 8). There is no evidence that he was poorly treated at Boys High, and when he matriculated he went to Canada, where his mother was living.

‘Possibly what upsets me more is that the size of his donation was leaked somehow. I did the fundraising alone with the help of my secretary of 20 years and one of the bases of the fundraising was that the amount of a donation was treated in the strictest confidence. I only targeted alumni and close friends of the school and believe that our success in raising R32 million in four years was based on the confidentiality factor. Until the publication of this article, the only thing a member of the Pretoria Boys High community would know is that Elon Musk did donate as his name appears on a donor board together with his year group, making no differentiation between some who gave R100 or R1 million.’15

By all accounts, Musk enjoyed his time at Boys High. Kimbal later joined him at the school. I also attended Boys High and was five years behind Musk. The school’s entire ethos of producing gentlemen who are an asset to South Africa is inculcated in everything it does. Masters wear gowns, and it is drilled into boys from the minute they start their schooling there that you stand when an adult enters a room, you greet teachers and visiting adults as Ma’am and Sir and not Mr or Mrs, you are never seen in public in uniform where your socks are around your ankles or your tie is not properly knotted, and you generally conduct yourself as a school that first opened its doors in 1901 demands of you by the weight of its history and legacy. For those who have never attended a traditional boys’ school, it can seem an entirely foreign concept. Even the grade system is different. Whereas in those days you were in Standard 6 when you started high school, and these days you are in Grade 8, at Pretoria Boys High it has always been Form I. The grades are referred to as forms. The more disciplined environment of a boys’ school indicates that Musk’s bullying did not continue when he arrived at Boys High. It was, of course, not a perfect school. No school is. But Boys High has always been determined to celebrate each boy, whether he be a sports star, an academic genius or a cultural phenomenon. It is a school that, no matter a boy’s background, does not accept what a boy is, and believes far more in what a boy can become.

And it was here, among the pine trees and in the main building, designed by Patrick Eagle, who also designed the Supreme Court building in Johannesburg, that Musk’s obsession with space, as well as his genius, became even more clear.

It is quite apparent in the physics marking book of Daniela Albers, Musk’s science teacher in Form 5B in 1988. There, in blue ink, it records that ‘Musk, E’ averaged 80 per cent that year. He gained an academic distinction, beating his closest rival by 13 per cent. According to Albers, the physics quizzes included a ‘test on electricity’ or electrical circuits, in which Musk beat 20 class rivals. Albers also tested her students on momentum, free fall and inertia – all things a future rocket scientist should know about. Musk just missed out on first place in an exam on momentum but tied for first place on his understanding of Newton’s three laws of motion.

Years later, Albers was one of millions who watched SpaceX’s first launch, headed by her former pupil from a class that sat at the end of a block in a school on a hill in Pretoria. As Albers had been my science teacher as well, I contacted her to ask for her recollections of Musk: ‘For me watching the SpaceX launch, I obviously felt quite proud, thinking, “Gee, hopefully I played a small part.” But to be honest, I think he’s such an intelligent person he probably could have done it without me,’ she said.

And then she reflected on that boy in her class: ‘He was a very quiet boy, who sat at the back of the class and just got on with his work. Obviously, he was the highest marked in the class, with a distinction for science at the end of the year.’

But she has a very clear and lasting memento of Elon Musk, one that remained in her class for many years after he left: ‘I remember him bringing a beautiful model of a rocket into class for a project.’ And yet she also admitted that she wasn’t sure if it was in fact his rocket, because Musk was such a quiet boy who kept largely to himself.

There is every indication that, in high school, Musk remained the shy and introverted boy he had been in primary school. David Johnson, a fellow Boys High pupil at the time, told me: ‘I remember Kimbal as a friendly, outgoing guy. Very different to Elon.’ Johnson has photos from his school yearbook showing a smiling Kimbal Musk with his date at their matric dance. There is also a 1990 photo of ‘Sergeant K Musk’ in the school’s cadet squad, and further mention of him as sergeant of No 3 Troop on the inspection parade. Similarly, he’s seated in the middle in the front row of a 1990 photo of the school’s Academic Ties for that year.

The opposite is true for his older brother. In his matric year (1988), Elon doesn’t appear anywhere in the school’s yearbook, The Pretorian, other than on the fourth page as part of ‘The Leaving Group of 1988’. The name of ‘E Musk’ is listed as a member of ‘Form 5B: Mrs Marshall’. Musk’s name is absent from the 1988 list of ‘Digni Laude – Outstanding Scholars for 1988’, most notably in the categories of maths and science. But he is mentioned as having earned two matric distinctions, in science and computer studies. He does not appear on the list of Academic Ties either.

‘My impression is that Elon kept to himself and was relatively quiet and reserved. I believe he was involved with the computer club at school, but otherwise was not really visible in mainstream activities,’ says Gavin Ehlers, who was head boy at the school in 1988.

Even those who went to Bryanston High School struggle to remember much about Musk. In a Facebook group for former Bryanston High pupils, the comments about Musk all have a familiar theme: ‘He was very quiet’; ‘I cannot remember him at all’; ‘He was a quiet, unassuming person.’

‘I remember playing chess with him. He was quiet and kept to himself.’

The person who wrote this post was in fact on the school’s chess ‘A’ team with Musk, and in a chess team photo is sitting just one place away from him. Yet Musk kept so much to himself that the chess player hardly remembers more than this.

The comments continued: ‘I was in the same group of kids and I don’t remember him at all. I wonder who he was friends with and why no one helped him … Sad.’

‘I know someone who was in Elon Musk’s class. He said the bullying was out of hand and that Elon was very badly hurt.’

‘Who didn’t get bullied at school? Part of life. When I told my parents I was getting bullied, my father basically said, “Suck it up buttercup. Life is tough. And it is gonna get tougher. Deal with it.”’

‘I was in the same year as him. Very quiet kid … was picked on a lot.’

‘His nickname was “Bunny” because of his two protruding front top teeth. He was very quiet, spoke to no one and read all the time. He was teased in the class.’16

From his Bryanston High years, there is a school photo of him in the chess team, and another that appeared in a local newspaper where his Standard 8 (Grade 10) class is celebrated for knitting 720 blanket squares for a local charity drive. Musk is pictured top right in the photo. But other than this, Musk seems to have gone through Bryanston High School and Pretoria Boys High School in relative anonymity.

Kimbal, on the other hand, appeared the more outgoing of the two. He matriculated from Boys High in 1990, and he did so with only one distinction less than his brother – for history. An essay he wrote in Afrikaans, ‘Die Geskiedenis van Oorlog’ (The History of War), appeared in The Pretorian of 1990. And he played first-team basketball for his school.

Even Bill Schroder doesn’t recall much about the boy who he would years later approach – along with a host of other Old Boys – to assist with the school’s fundraising efforts. I know Schroder, affectionately called ‘The Boss’, from my own time at the school and in my subsequent involvement with the school. When we spoke about Musk he said, ‘I remember being called by Time magazine to comment for a cover article they were doing about him, and I had to tell them that I couldn’t really say much because I didn’t know him that well. I asked some of the teachers who had been in the school a long time, and some had vague memories of him, but also not enough to feel they could comment about him.’

But after school, Musk wasted no time in realising his own ambitions. And in his mind, they lay in the United States, where the technology boom was building, and with it this new thing called the Internet that he desperately wanted to be a part of.
