title: Don’t Panic
---




IN Elon Musk’s household, there is one golden rule: ‘Don’t Panic.’ It comes from the hugely popular Douglas Adams novel, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a personal favourite of Musk. It’s also a Musk business rule.

On 6 February 2018, when Musk’s space exploration company SpaceX launched its Falcon Heavy rocket, the ‘dummy payload’ was Musk’s own Tesla Roadster, with a dummy named ‘Starman’ sitting in the driver’s seat. The words ‘Don’t Panic’ featured on the car’s instrument display. Also printed on the car’s circuit board was ‘Made on Earth by humans’.

Maye Musk would likely have smiled at this as she recognised a golden thread running through their adventurous family. Her own family’s motto was ‘Live dangerously – carefully’. Maye’s father, Joshua, was unapologetic in his desire to live a full life, to explore the unknown and to be different. And he brought this adventurous spirit with him to Pretoria. ‘I grew up in a family that had an airplane and a fascination with exploration … My father was never one to do what anyone else was doing … My father always said, “There’s nothing a Haldeman can’t do,”’1 she wrote in her memoir.

The Haldeman kids were every bit part of these adventures with their eccentric parents, whether it was flights in their plane through Central Africa, horseback rides through Lesotho or the annual trips the family took for almost a decade after Joshua embarked on a quest to find the fabled Lost City of the Kalahari.

Haldeman was captivated by the legend of the Lost City, which had gained worldwide popularity from an 1885 book by the Canadian Guillermo Farini (real name William Leonard Hunt) in which he claimed to have discovered this Atlantis of the desert. At the time the Haldeman family settled in Pretoria, there had been a resurgence of interest in searching for the site. And among the many expeditions that set out on foot, in wagons and trucks, and even with aircraft loaned by the Union Defence Force, Haldeman was said to be the most devoted to the cause. It drew interest from the Royal Geographical Society in London, and even led the author Alan Paton, of Cry, The Beloved Country fame, to join a 1956 expedition and write a small book about it.

After his first expedition in 1953, Haldeman made 12 trips in search of a city he never found but whose existence he never stopped believing in. Two books about this fabled place quoted Joshua extensively on the subject. It remains a topic of debate to this day and amateur explorers still delight in leading their own expeditions, although they acknowledge that the Lost City is more likely an unusual rock formation rather than actual ruins. The notion even found its way into the imagination of hotel magnate Sol Kerzner and, drawing on other mythical African cities, served as the inspiration for the luxurious Palace of the Lost City development at Sun City.

Pierre Viljoen remembers well how these expeditions caught the imagination of South Africans. ‘It made big news in those days,’ recalls Viljoen, a respected Pretoria resident who through his own successful businesses in advertising and publishing would later become friends with Musk’s father, Errol. He also knew the Haldeman family by reputation. Pretoria has always been a close-knit community, and successful families are known and remembered. Viljoen’s intersection with the Haldemans and the Musks stretches even further to his being an old boy of Pretoria Boys High School, where Elon and his brother Kimbal would complete their schooling. Viljoen remains an active member of the school’s old boys’ association, and has a close relationship with Bill Schroder, the former headmaster, who himself has had interactions with Musk. The concept of six degrees of separation is very apt when it comes to Pretoria.

‘The Haldemans were a very respected family in Pretoria in those days,’ recalls Viljoen. ‘I used to live in Queenswood and would travel past their house in Soutpansberg Road on my way into town. They had a big house with a big garden on the left-hand side, and old man Haldeman ran his chiropractic clinic from there. His wife ran a ballet and dance school there as well. Joshua and a friend of his named Ponie de Wet made it their goal to find this Lost City of the Kalahari.’

Ponie (Pieter Hugo) de Wet and his wife, Aletta (nicknamed Lettie or Lee), were close friends of the Haldemans. Ponie was himself a successful businessman and shared Joshua’s passion for flying and adventure, and the two families would have dinner together every Sunday night. ‘Ponie’s wife ran a modelling school in Pretoria – the Lee de Wet School of Modelling. It was very well known,’ says Viljoen. It was in fact here that Maye Haldeman started her own modelling career at the age of 15.

Maye also remembers the many family expeditions into the Kalahari, in what is now Botswana. She went on eight of these camping trips and recalls how some would last as long as three weeks, with her parents packing everything they needed to survive. She has a photo of her and her siblings sitting on camp chairs around a fireplace with a traditional black three-legged pot in it. All of them are reading books. In the background is the car and the Bellanca aircraft, which was nicknamed ‘Winnie’.

‘I think my father just loved to explore the unknown, learn about new cultures, and discover new areas; he and my mom never stopped learning. He loved bush-bashing, making his own roads through the desert,’2 Maye recalls. Her father would ‘shoot for the pot’ and they lived like true pioneers among the lions, hyenas and leopards.

They were definitely an adventurous couple, and oldest son Scott recalls how his mother entered and won the South African Pistol Shooting Championships, and how his parents also entered the strenuous Cape to Algiers Motor Rally and tied for first place. In 1952, the couple flew all the way to Europe, and as far as Scotland and Norway, in their plane.

It’s quite clear that Elon Musk inherited his love of adventure from his grandfather. ‘My grandfather moved to South Africa because he wanted to use it as a base for exploration,’3 he has said. And he’s spoken with great pride of his grandfather’s many flights, including the claim that he was the first person to fly from South Africa to Australia: ‘He did this in a plane with no electronic instruments, and in some places they had diesel and in some places they had gasoline, and he had to rebuild the engine according to whatever fuel they had.’4

There is in fact documented proof of the trip – in a historical study of Dr Joshua Haldeman’s career by the Canadian Chiropractic Association – which took place in 1954 and involved Joshua’s taking a 50 000-kilometre trip up the coast of Africa, across the South Asian coast to Australia, around Australia and back to South Africa. It states that he is considered to have been the only private pilot to have made the trip in a single-engine aircraft.5

Maye also recalls how her father would simply map out the Kalahari on his own with a traditional compass. There was no limit to his sense of adventure, whether it was the Kalahari or the world, as he and his wife flew themselves to international chiropractic conferences. ‘Just my dad, my mom, and Winnie, flying over the Pacific in search of the world,’6 Maye recalled.

But Joshua’s love of flying would eventually claim his life. Musk was only three years old when his grandfather was killed in a flying accident in 1974 when his plane hit power lines. As Scott Haldeman, who was studying at the University of British Columbia at the time, tells the story, Joshua and a friend were coming down for a practice landing: ‘There was a power line between where both poles were hidden in trees in a forest, and as they came down to land between them the wheels caught on the power line and the plane flipped over and killed them both. I think given a choice, that would have been a way he would have been very happy going.’7

Just as his grandfather had searched for adventure in this world, and in the fables of lost worlds, his grandson Elon would go in search of his own worlds – from the deepest reaches of a new world known as the Internet to the deepest reaches of space.

But first Elon Musk would have to negotiate the very real challenges of his own world, which would change drastically early in his life. It would have a profound impact on him. These would be some of the hardest years of his life. A boy lost in his imagination and the exploding ideas in his head would find himself lost at home as his family disintegrated, then lost at school as he first struggled to fit in and then struggled to survive.
