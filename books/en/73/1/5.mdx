title: Educating Elon
---




DANNY Warnick was sitting on the steps of Hatfield Primary School in Pretoria during break and trying to solve the latest school craze – a Rubik’s Cube – when the new kid walked past. The kid looked a little strange. And he looked lonely.

‘So, I decided to befriend him,’ says Warnick. Within a few days, his new friend Elon had helped him solve the Rubik’s Cube. And from there, Danny Warnick and Elon Musk became best friends.

Warnick and his childhood relationship with Elon Musk surfaced through a school photo. In tracing the life of a man who has made his billions in technology and the Internet, it’s hardly surprising that the digital world should prove to be fertile ground. In a Facebook post, Warnick shared a photo of the Standard 5 (Grade 7) class at Hatfield Primary School in 1983. ‘Notice the boy second row left and the name,’ he wrote on the post, ‘Elon Musk’. There, wearing plain grey shorts and white-collared short-sleeve shirt, stands an awkward-looking boy, his arms stiff by his side as he stares at the camera. Already, Musk appears out of place among the smiling young faces around him. A boy sent to school a year early because of his genius, but an awkward and introverted child who just never seemed to fit in.

From that class photo, I tracked down Warnick. Among the many leads I followed from people who claimed to know Musk or his family, Warnick was one of the very few to agree to speak on the matter. Perhaps because he spoke the truth when he said he was Musk’s best friend at school. The many others who boldly proclaimed on Facebook posts or in groups that they knew Musk suddenly went quiet or refused to say more when I contacted them directly. And often it became more a case of ‘Well, I knew of him …’

‘I think what helped is that we had the same interests,’ Warnick says when we speak on the phone. ‘I was also a shy, introverted kid, and he was as well. He was quite a loner. He was also quite odd-looking, and he had these huge braces. To me he was a bit like that Sheldon dude in the TV series Big Bang Theory.

‘But Elon was a very pleasant guy once you got to know him. He was very mature for his age and not an emotional character. He was very factual, and you knew exactly where you stood with him. I’d say our friendship wasn’t typical of children of that age. But we had great times.’

That’s not the only thing that stood out for Warnick.

‘From the moment we met I could see this guy was way above his grade in intelligence. He was very competitive in the maths class especially. We had a running competition between the two of us to see who could score the best on a maths paper. Our school principal, Mr Henry Alleman, had a PhD in maths and Elon and I really looked forward to his class while the other kids hated it. Elon always beat me in maths. He was highly intelligent in maths and science. But if you asked him to catch a bus from Hatfield to Church Square, he wouldn’t be able to do that. He was socially quite awkward like that. I think his sister, Tosca, said the same thing.’

She did indeed. To his family and to a friend such as Warnick, Musk appeared quite at home in his own world, but very out of place in the world.

Musk arrived at Hatfield Primary School midway through Standard 2 [Grade 4]. His father had taken him out of Waterkloof House Preparatory School, a private boys’ school in Brooklyn, Pretoria, where money and status were the language. Errol had decided his child might be better suited to a government school that would offer him more of the real world and ‘normal people’. Musk’s new school, in the Pretoria suburb of Hatfield, certainly offered such an opportunity.

Hatfield always had its own unique charm, which it retained far longer than many of the city’s other suburbs because of its location on the edge of the city centre. It was a bustling residential suburb by the 1930s, and some of its landmarks became Pretoria icons. The Hillcrest Public Swimming Pool, built in 1935, was Pretoria’s first public pool and for many years its only Olympic-sized pool. On hot summer days, families would come here to relax on the lawns, and it was also the venue for highly competitive school galas.

Hatfield Primary School, located on the corner of Duncan and Schoeman streets, opened its doors in 1916. Surprisingly, Musk’s primary school is only a short drive away from Soutpansberg Road, where his mother grew up. Hatfield’s primary and high schools developed a vibrant and youthful culture that fed into the student life of the nearby University of Pretoria.1

Sean Schulze attended Hatfield Primary in the time Musk was there, and remembers those years well. Sparked by the photo posted by Warnick, he remembered Musk as an intelligent and interesting boy. In a follow-up interview, Schulze was also one of the rare few able to follow through with his claims: ‘I have fond memories of Elon. He was interesting company. His conversation was always a little more cerebral and meaningful than that average kid at school, and I always remember having enjoyable conversations with him. I also enjoyed playing chess with him. And I remember him being very interested in the science fiction books of Isaac Asimov.’

But so many others had hardly noticed the future billionaire in their midst, and were surprised to be reminded that they once went to school with Elon Musk. It’s a theme that runs throughout Musk’s school years, of a boy who passed almost unnoticed through the school halls.

Warnick, though, did notice him, and the friendship he and Musk forged was by far the closest in the short time they were together: ‘I was his best friend from Grade 5 to Grade 7. Today, kids would call it BFFs. Hatfield was still very much a suburb in those days before it became the business district it is today, and his dad owned one of the houses close to the school, on the corner of Duncan and Burnett St where there is now a filling station. He used this as his office. Elon and I used to go there after school and do our homework together.

‘Their home was on the plot in Lonehill, and they would drive through every day. I spent many weekends with Elon on the plot in Lonehill.’

As much as Elon fitted the mould of the nerdy, geeky type, Warnick says there was definitely another side to him: ‘He definitely wasn’t a sporting type at all. He never played sport in primary school. When it came to ball sense, he had two left feet. But he also wasn’t the typical just stay-at-home and play TV games type. Sure, he was very much into his superhero comic books. So was I. But on the plot at Lonehill, we’d do a lot of outdoor things. They had a couple of horses, and his dad, Errol, was wealthy as far as I was concerned. Elon had everything he could’ve wanted.

‘I came from a very average middle-class family, and his dad was quite wealthy by our standards. His dad had a passion for sports cars and luxury cars, and it was always a treat for me when we used to drive through to their plot in a Rolls Royce or a Porsche or a Maserati.

‘On the plot, Elon had all the toys a boy could want. We rode around on little motorbikes and would shoot BB guns and get up to all kinds of mischief that boys do. We were also both into aviation and radio-controlled aircraft. And in the evenings we’d play chess and TV games, and read comic books.’

It was on one such occasion, while chasing around on the plot with their BB guns, that Musk accidently shot his best friend.

‘He shot me in the forehead. I was so angry that I chased after him. Elon ran away and hid in the stables. When I found him, I took a shot at him as well. He started screaming like a murdered cat.’

Apart from this incident, Warnick remembers it as a very happy time. And he recalls Elon being just as happy as a child: ‘He got along really well with his dad. His dad was divorced at that stage. His brother and sister were living elsewhere in South Africa. But Elon always seemed happy, and it never looked like a strained or difficult time in his life. He seemed more than happy. I only ever met his dad. I never met his other siblings or his mom. If I’m not mistaken, his younger brother Kimbal was at school in Bloemfontein at the time. It could’ve been Grey College, I’m not sure. I know nothing about his sister, Tosca. She was hardly ever mentioned in the time I was friends with him. I met the grandparents on a few occasions.

‘In later years, when Elon moved to Canada and then the United States, I think slowly a rift started developing between him and his dad. I don’t know why. His dad also had mixed fortunes, and his fair share of ups and downs.’

Warnick remembers Errol as being quite a hands-on father with Elon: ‘As far as my childhood memories go, his dad always took us out on trips and we went water-skiing on the Vaal River. Errol and Elon were both accomplished water-skiers, and they taught me. I went on to become a provincial water-skier because of them. His dad had also bought a game lodge in the Hoedspruit area and we went out there once or twice.’

And he remembers Errol as actively encouraging Elon’s aptitude for maths and science, and his general curiosity about the world: ‘His dad would always play car games with some maths and science involved. So he’d ask things like how far in kilometres do you think that hill is? He’d speak to us about aircraft and aviation, but on a more senior level than what you would do with most children. He’d always encourage Elon to question, and he’d put maths and science into anything he did with us. His dad really pushed the academia.’

What Musk may have lacked in genuine affection from his father was counterbalanced by an environment that stimulated his thinking and the propensity of his brain to soak up information like a sponge. Musk certainly seems to have emerged as a very potent blend of the eccentricities and adventurous, never-say-die attitude (‘There is nothing a Haldeman cannot do’) of his mother’s family, and the logical and engineering genius of his father.

Errol certainly noticed this. In 2015, he told Forbes magazine: ‘Elon has always been an introvert thinker. So where a lot of people would go to a great party and have a great time and drink and talk about all sorts of things like rugby or sport, you would find Elon had found the person’s library and was going through their books. He’d find fun in that, not to say he wasn’t a person who would party every now and then.’2

It also explains why Errol was hardly as concerned as the rest of the world, Tesla shareholders included, when Elon appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in September 2018 and smoked marijuana on camera. The incident made headlines and caused a few stock fluctuations in his companies. But Errol was unmoved: ‘Elon is the most unlikely guy in the world to get high on marijuana. He hates the taste of alcohol and would have a milkshake rather than anything else.’3 Once again, there is an echo of his grandfather’s approach to life; Joshua Haldeman had a general distaste for alcohol.

Speaking on Bruce Whitfield’s Money Show on Radio 702,4 Errol also recalled: ‘He had brilliant ideas right from the start … Elon has always been a very deep thinker. The kind of things he would come out with as a youngster were always somewhat surprising. For example, when he was very small – about three or four – he would ask me, “Where is the whole world?” These sorts of questions made me realise he is a little different.’

And Maye recalls a boy who read everything he could get his hands on: ‘When Elon was young, I noticed that he read everything … Elon remembered everything that he read. He was always absorbing information. We called Elon the encyclopaedia, because he had read the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Collier’s Encyclopedia and remembered everything. That’s also why we called him Genius Boy. We could ask him anything.’5

Elon himself declared: ‘I was raised by books, and then my parents.’6

But Maye makes a critical point in what she believes has been the difference between the genius of her son and other geniuses. According to her, Elon has been able to articulate his genius into actually accomplishing things rather than just thinking about them. It’s a distinction not just poignant to her.

The science behind genius still cannot fully answer why this is the case, or, rather, why some highly gifted individuals excel and others don’t.

Perhaps the most important attempt to answer this question has been the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), founded by psychologist Julian Stanley at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The study began in 1971, the year Elon Musk was born, and is considered one of the longest-running longitudinal studies of gifted youth.

Stanley’s inspiration was a child named Joseph Louis Bates. A local computer science instructor who was running a summer programme for children had noticed what she called Bates’s ‘extreme intellectual precocity’ and had alerted Stanley. In 1996, in a paper titled ‘In the Beginning: The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth’,7 Stanley wrote, ‘I was somewhat hesitant and perhaps even reluctant at first to get involved: there were too many other pressing duties. But I did, and my life and career were never to be the same again.’

Stanley exposed the 13-year-old Bates – or Joe, as he called him – to a series of college-grade aptitude tests, specifically the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), which is the standard college entrance exam in the United States. ‘His scores were startlingly excellent,’ he wrote. This recalls the computer aptitude test that Elon took at the University of Pretoria at the age of 17. A letter dated 17 May 1989 from the university’s Office of the Director: Information Management stated, ‘The results were outstanding.’ Musk scored an A+ in both operating and programming, despite being a year younger than the other students taking the test.

Stanley discovered something similar with Joe as he exposed him to even more difficult tasks: ‘Joe thrived and went on to receive his BA and Master’s degrees in computer science at age 17. Then, still 17, he became a doctoral student at Cornell University.’

Over the next two decades of Stanley’s research, the SMPY grew from 450 students to 150 000 annually. The children who typically qualified to be part of the study were those who could complete a year-long syllabus of algebra in three weeks. The SMPY later grew from just identifying and developing gifted students to tracking the careers of these students, and it has been the subject of over 400 academic papers and several books.

‘We have the evidence to show that if you provide services to gifted children, we can detect differences 40 to 50 years later,’8 says Camilla Persson Benbow, who was one of Stanley’s psychology students and now leads the SMPY, with David Lubinski. The now 50-year-old study still has the same goal: to gather data that shows the connection between early intellectual ability and adult achievement. In a sampling of over 1 600 gifted children, the study found that 560 went on to earn PhDs. The same group registered 681 patents and wrote 85 books and 7 752 scholarly papers.9

According to the researchers, ‘The findings here indicate that above-level testing at an early age is a helpful tool for identifying individuals with profoundly high ability who have the potential to make great contributions to society in adulthood.’10 Or, put another way, ‘Whether we like it or not, these people really do control our society.’11 So says Jonathan Wai, a psychologist at the Duke University Talent Identification Programme (TIP), which partners with the SMPY. According to David Lubinski, ‘This population is the one that has the most promise to solve some of the most complex problems of our time’12 – problems such as sustainable energy, carbon dioxide production, electric cars and, ultimately, a second Earth on Mars.

It’s quite clear that Musk would have easily qualified for such a study, and would have been classed as a gifted child. It’s also clear that Errol’s care created an environment of excellence and study that was possibly pushed very hard and at the expense of a more nurturing relationship.

‘[I instilled in Elon a work ethic of] “Make every minute count. No gap weekends, never mind gap years,”’13 said Errol. Musk has retained this almost inhuman work ethic. Maye had a hand in it as well, although hers was born out of sheer necessity while trying to raise three children alone after her divorce. ‘I think they saw me working all the time,’14 she said of what her kids may have learned from her.

Musk admitted in 2018 that the demands of juggling both Tesla and SpaceX saw him working over 120 hours a week and often sleeping on his factory floor. He has since, he said, cut this back to 80 to 90 hours a week. What drives this punishing work schedule seems to be a combination of factors. ‘I care a lot about the truth of things, and trying to understand the truth of things,’ Musk has said. ‘I seem to have a high innate drive, and that’s been true since I was a little kid.’15

Yet he also admits to being driven by fear. ‘The drive overrides fear, but I still feel the fear. It’s kind of annoying. I wish I felt it less … I feel fear more strongly than I would like.’16

Fear of failure? Fear of disappointing others? Or perhaps a fear that time is running out? ‘I have more ideas than time to implement.’17

Sometimes, it might even be a fear of his own mind and the constant explosion of ideas. In conversation with Joe Rogan, Musk said: ‘I don’t think you’d necessarily want to be me. I don’t think people would like it that much. It’s very hard to turn it off. It might sound great if it’s turned on, but what if it doesn’t turn off? … It’s like running the engine with no resistance.’18

It may well even be that there has been an innate drive since childhood to measure up to his father’s expectations. Errol’s approach to raising Elon may well have unlocked genius, but it most likely also unlocked feelings of resentment that Musk still harbours towards his father to this day.

Nevertheless, Errol provided one critical component that became the launchpad for Musk’s inquiring mind and supreme intelligence. And that was giving him access to his first computer. ‘When computers came out at the very beginning, it started off with him (Elon) saying he wanted to go on a course to use these new computers,’19 Errol recalled to Bruce Whitfield.

‘When I inquired about these courses, it was under the auspices of Hyperama, and experts were coming from England and all over. I inquired and they said they weren’t taking any children. But Elon persisted. This was when he was 11. I was doing some engineering work for Hyperama, and I managed to book Elon a seat at the inaugural lecture for R75, which was a lot of money in those days. It was hosted at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

‘He went and they told me he had to sit on the side and keep quiet. He had to dress appropriately, so he was there with a jacket and tie and his primary-school grey trousers. I left him there and went to get a hamburger with Kimbal. It was a three-hour-long lecture, and when we came back and everybody came out, there was no Elon. We waited and waited and finally went into the halls and found the lecture hall. There was Elon with his jacket and tie off and sleeves rolled up in his long grey flannels, four feet high, talking to all these blokes from England. When I walked up, one of these professors, who didn’t even bother to introduce himself, said this boy needs to get his hands on one of these computers. So, we got one, thank God at a discount, and with that computer he taught himself, using Disk Operating System, which is DOS, to program. Then in the mid-Eighties I remember him showing me a box with a red light on it and he would say, “This is a modem. With this, computers can talk to one another. If that computer is on the line, then I can talk to a computer in England and ask it questions.” He was always switched on.’20 That blinking red light certainly switched on Musk’s brain to the potential of computers and, as he admitted to Joe Rogan, it has never switched off since.

Musk remembers the moment he first set eyes on a computer: ‘When I was ten years old, I went into a store in South Africa and saw a Commodore VIC-20. I thought this was the most awesome thing I’d ever seen. You could write computer programs and make games. I’d played Atari and other games when I was six or seven, so the idea that I could create games was really exciting. So that was my first computer. I think it had like 8 KB of memory.’21

It was on this computer that Musk wrote his first computer game, called Blastar. He sold it to a computer magazine for $500. Musk was already showing himself to be quite an entrepreneur as he delivered newspapers and even dabbled in the stock market: ‘I had various odd jobs … I also did a little bit of stock market stuff when I was about 15 or 16. I actually did pretty well just making bets on some stocks in South Africa. But I just made a few bets that did pretty well. I tripled my initial tiny stake and then that stopped because I just didn’t like it,’ he said in a 2009 podcast interview.22

As much as Errol was determined to encourage his son’s genius, Musk’s childhood friend Danny Warnick suggests it might have been Errol’s age-old penchant for a pretty girl that ultimately got in the way of their relationship: ‘I don’t mean to be nasty when I say this, but I think Errol was a bit of a playboy. I spent many a weekend with them over a period of two to three years, and often there was another lady in the house. I don’t think Elon approved of that.’

Danny Warnick lost contact with Musk after primary school. He went to the Glen High School in the east of Pretoria, while Musk went to Bryanston High School in Johannesburg. The last time they met, Warnick recalls how Musk wasn’t particularly keen on going to Bryanston High School: ‘I saw him once or twice after primary school. We didn’t have cellphones then. The last time I saw him was some time in Grade 8 [Standard 6]. We’d spent the weekend on the plot in Lonehill. I drove with him and his dad on the Monday morning, and his dad dropped him off at Bryanston High and then took me home. Even then, he wasn’t keen to go to school. He wasn’t picked on in primary school, but in high school he was singled out. As I said, he was kind of odd-looking with these big braces, and because of that, you know what kids are like. He reminds me of that typical nerd versus jock story.’

After school, Warnick became involved in the motor industry and is now manager of a Mercedes-Benz dealership and owner of his own motor vehicle brokerage company in Pretoria. ‘I’m not close to what Elon has become,’ he jokes, adding that he is now happy to watch Musk’s astounding success from the sidelines: ‘It actually started filtering through about ten years ago. I come from a large family with four sisters and they all knew Elon was my friend. You’d see articles here and there about him. But then one of my sisters said Elon Musk is in the newspapers and media quite a bit. It was when he sold his company Zip2. I always thought he’d do well, but now here’s this guy reaching for the stars. I thought, damn, I should’ve stayed in contact with him.’

A soft-spoken man, Warnick now has no contact whatsoever with the Musk of his past. He expresses some sadness that Musk has cut all of his ties to South Africa and never even mentions the country of his birth: ‘I haven’t had contact with him since primary school. He doesn’t seem very concerned or interested in South Africa. He never mentions the country. I don’t know if he has a dislike for it or if it just doesn’t feature on his radar.’

And he says he feels uncomfortable about suddenly popping up on Musk’s radar as a long-lost friend. But the past did bump into him. It was while walking around Pretoria’s Brooklyn Mall that Musk’s past stared him right in the face: ‘I bumped into his father, Errol, a couple of years ago at the Brooklyn Mall. He gave me Elon’s personal email address. At that stage Elon was already very well known. I sent him an email, and never heard back from him. But I kind of feel that now that he’s a rock star, I don’t want to just all of a sudden rekindle that friendship.’

A friendship that began on the steps of Hatfield Primary School, and around the shared desire to solve a puzzle. A Rubik’s Cube.

But there is one particular memory of Elon Musk that Warnick treasures: ‘When we had our graduation at Hatfield Primary School, I won the maths cup for that year. I still remember the name of it. It was called the Barrowman Cup. For some reason, that final year I was able to pip Elon to the post on that one. He was mad as hell about that.’

The other memory, of an unhappy Elon Musk being driven to Bryanston High School that last Monday morning Warnick saw him, would prove just as poignant.

For Elon Musk, high school in Bryanston would present a far greater challenge than any maths competition.
