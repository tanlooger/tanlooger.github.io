FOR Elon Musk, the end of high school did not necessarily signify the sense of a new world opening up before him. For white South African males, the notion that ‘the world is your oyster’ had to wait a few years – two years in fact. In the meantime, they belonged to the South African government, and, in particular, to the South African Defence Force (SADF).

By the time Musk reached the end of his secondary education, compulsory conscription for military service was at its peak. All white males between the ages of 17 and 65 had to serve. The arrival of the matric certificate would usually be followed by a brown envelope containing the Notification of Allotment for National Service, which indicated that you had been called up for duty ‘in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Act, 1957’. The letter provided the details of the unit you were to report to, the place of service and the duration.

Conscription was the government’s response to the increasing threat, both internal and external, from communism (the dreaded rooi gevaar, or ‘red threat’) and the exiled ANC. The growing pressure on the country was beginning to bear fruit, and the South African government responded as it knew best – with the force of its efficient and well-run police and armed forces. As a result, the 1980s was one of the most violent decades in the country’s history.

Following the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the government had cracked down hard on political unrest, banning the ANC and other liberation organisations. The 1976 Soweto uprising, which took place when Musk was still a young boy, was another watershed moment. The government responded to what it perceived as a ‘total onslaught’ with the ‘total strategy’, which aimed to mobilise the whole of South African society against the threat from communism and African nationalism. But by the mid-1980s, faced with a more unified attack from various anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, the ‘total strategy’ was starting to lose impetus. President PW Botha was feeling the pressure from outside as a result of growing international pressure and sanctions against South Africa. Within the ruling National Party there were differing views on the way forward.

By the time Musk’s Form V (Grade 12) year ended in 1988, the country was aflame as police clashed with political activists and the SADF was deployed to the townships. The ANC and its military wing, uMkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), escalated its campaign of resistance with a series of limpet mines and bombs. The popular Sterland cinema complex in Pretoria and several Wimpy restaurants were bombed. A bomb that exploded outside the Standard Bank in Roodepoort in June, killing four and injuring 18, led The New York Times to call it ‘the worst South African bombing in a year’.1 Bomb drills became routine at South African schools.

South Africa was also embroiled in the Border War (1966–1990), a long-running conflict that pitted the SADF against the guerrilla forces of the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO) in then South West Africa (now Namibia). From the mid-1970s, the scope of the Border War expanded, as South Africa sought to influence the outcome of Angola’s independence process and subsequent civil war. The SADF made many forays into Angola, ostensibly in pursuit of SWAPO guerrillas, leading to clashes with Angola’s armed forces, which were backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. By 1988, the Border War was at its peak.

The South African government was fighting a war on its streets and on its borders. And for that it required soldiers – plenty of them. Among those who heeded the ‘call-up’, or compulsory conscription, there were most certainly many who saw it as their duty to defend God and country against threats both internal and external. There were also those young men who had no idea what career path to follow straight after school, and saw two years in the SADF as time to decide what they wanted to actually do with their lives. Others found a sense of community in the brown uniforms they wore, and in the bright smiles on dirty faces gathered together in photos sent home from the Border. And still others may have been attracted by the last opportunity for adventure, to test themselves and ‘man up’ before settling into the routine of civilian adult life.

But many of the 1 791 South African soldiers who died in the Border War2 were just boys who felt they had no choice. Their call-up papers came, and they had to go. According to historian Graeme Callister, ‘For most men, obedience to conscription was not a conscious decision but simply something that had to be done, a kind of rite of passage to manhood that became as naturally part of a white South African male’s life as going to school or getting a job.’3 For Peter Dickens, whose website The Observation Post surveys the totality of South African military history, ‘It was a campaign which came about in an age when service in the SADF was part of South Africa’s socio-cultural make-up – this was a very normative practice.’4 In the popular 1984 film Boetie Gaan Border Toe, Arnold Vosloo plays a hapless young Afrikaner who at first tries to evade conscription before finding brotherhood among his fellow troops on the Border.

But for a young white South African leaving school with a headful of exploding ideas, this was hardly a moment of freedom.

The End Conscription Campaign (ECC), which had begun in 1983, had also been banned by 1988. The government followed this with even harsher measures for those who ignored the call-up, raising the penalty from two to six years in prison. Magnus Malan, then defence minister, said at the time: ‘The End Conscription Campaign is a direct enemy of the SADF. It’s disgraceful that the SADF, but especially the country’s young people, the pride of the nation, should be subjected to the ECC’s propaganda, suspicion-sowing and misinformation.’5 Malan went so far as to liken the ECC to the banned ANC.

It was in this climate that Musk was preparing to leave school. He would no doubt have read of Charles Bester. After finishing Standard 10 (Grade 12) at St Martin’s School in Johannesburg, Bester refused to report for military service, citing his Christian beliefs. He was given a six-year prison sentence on 5 December 1988 and sent to Kroonstad prison.

According to Bester at the time, ‘apartheid means separation and its application is a denial of Christ’s exhortation to love one’s neighbour as oneself. The role the SADF is playing in South Africa underpins the policies of division of the present government. I believe that in order for me to follow a path that will best demonstrate my love for God, my country and my fellow South Africans, I must pursue the way of reconciliation and non-violence. I will therefore refuse to serve in the SADF.’6

Musk’s own family history, especially that of his politically active father, Errol, meant he was never going to consider fighting for the apartheid government. It was against this background of a country on the brink of civil war and his own desire to get to the US and pursue his interest in the growing technology boom that Musk made a decision. He had to leave South Africa. ‘It always seemed like when there was cool technology or things happening, it was kind of in the United States. So, my goal as a kid was to get to go to America basically,’ he said.7

But going directly to the US was not an option for Musk. Instead, he started planning on returning to the country of his mother’s birth – Canada. And even this wasn’t as easy as it seemed. Musk had no real contacts there, apart from very distant family whom he’d never even met. He clearly required more time to plan his exit, but it was time he didn’t have, with the SADF just as eager to get its hands on him.

So Musk decided to buy himself some time by enrolling at the University of Pretoria in 1989. There is no public record of what he actually enrolled for. In May 1989, Musk was given a computer aptitude test by JLM Wiechers, the university’s director of information management. As later publicly shared by Maye Musk on Twitter, Musk received an A+ in both operating and programming, with Wiechers commenting, ‘The results were outstanding.’

The details of Musk’s time at the University of Pretoria are quite vague, so I made contact with Professor Karen Harris, who heads up the university archives. After a few days of digging in their files, Professor Harris confirmed the validity of Musk’s aptitude test, and that he had enrolled for a BCom in financial management at the university. The government did grant a deferment of conscription for those wishing to study first.

But Musk was still very much focused on getting to Canada, and it was clear he never intended to complete his BCom. As soon as he was able to purchase an air ticket, he discontinued his studies at the University of Pretoria.

Musk, not yet even 18 years old, was about to make a very brave decision. He would leave his family behind and fly to Canada on his own. You have to wonder about the conversations he would have had with his mother and father about this. These days, a child leaving home at the age of 17 remains a very complex decision, never mind in the late 1980s. Even more so considering that he left South Africa against his parents’ wishes.

‘In South Africa, whenever I read about technology and great innovation, it was coming from the United States. That’s where I wanted to be,’ Musk told the popular talk-show host Charlie Rose in a 2009 interview.8 ‘I tried to convince my parents to move there and neither of them would. They were divorced. My mother later moved back to Canada and then the US. So when I was 17, as soon as I got my Canadian passport, three weeks later I was in Canada.’9

Musk had planned to stay with an uncle in Montreal. However, upon arrival he was informed that the uncle was away in Minnesota. According to Musk, he had $2 000, a backpack of clothes and a suitcase of books. He was 17 and stuck.

After spending a few days in the city, staying at a youth hostel, Musk reached out to Mark Teulon, a cousin of his mother’s, who lived on a farm in Saskatchewan.10 The farm was near Swift Current, 170 km west of Moose Jaw, an area rich in Musk family history. In the strangest of ways, Musk had come home. It perhaps wasn’t lost on the teenage Musk that the town motto of Swift Current is ‘Where Life Makes Sense’.

Musk’s grandmother, Winnifred, came from Moose Jaw, and his grandfather and great-grandfather had deep roots in Saskatchewan. And so he bought himself a bus ticket and travelled more than 3 000 km from Montreal to Swift Current. From there it was another 18 km to Waldeck, and the Teulon grain farm. He was an adventurer in the grand tradition of his grandfather Joshua. And already, he was an island. The boy who didn’t fit in at school, who was always alone and kept to himself, who was happier being in his own head than in the crowd, was now experiencing the freedom of the wide world. He was shaping his own independent nature on the road.

Musk only spent about six weeks on the Teulons’ farm, but in that time he showed himself to be more than capable of the hard and unglamorous work of farming as he helped tend to the vegetables and shovelled out the grain bins. As his childhood friend Danny Warnick observed, Musk was not a jock, but he didn’t fit the typical mould of a nerd either. Clearing out the grain bins was particularly hard and hazardous work. When a bin was almost empty save for the last bit of grain at the bottom, Musk would have to climb inside, with the only light coming from the small hatch at the top. Farmers describe the bins as dark, dusty, loud and hot – and dangerous. There is the very real danger of either being hurt by the machinery that sweeps the grain or being engulfed by an avalanche of grain and dying of suffocation.

According to a report by Purdue University, more than 24 farmers are trapped in grain bins in any given year in the US Corn Belt. In fact, more accidents occur in confined agricultural spaces than in the mining industry. And on average, one in five grain bin accidents, or ‘entrapments’, involve teenage boys.11 Ironically, a robot has been invented to make the process safer, which farmers put inside the grain bin to disturb any potential risk areas in the grain. If Musk had worked this job long enough, he would no doubt have invented something similar.

His cousin said Musk quickly gave you the impression that he was not your normal teenager. ‘He was a pretty smart guy. We had that figured out pretty quick.’12 Musk celebrated his 18th birthday on the farm, and has a photograph taken on the day of himself wearing a cowboy hat and a cap on top of that and holding a hammer. After leaving the farm, Musk worked as a lumberjack and never shied away from using a chainsaw.

Almost two decades later, Elon Musk – as the founder of SpaceX and working feverishly to build rockets – would hire a bright young rocket engineer by the name of Thomas (Tom) Mueller. Mueller grew up in the small town of St Maries, Idaho, just two and a half hours from the Canadian border. He was a kid who spent most of his time in the library, reading science-fiction books. He was a kid interested in rockets. These were big dreams for a kid from a small town where the mainstay of the local economy was forestry. But Mueller’s maths teacher, Gary Hines, noticed his talent. And when Mueller told him he wanted to become an aircraft mechanic, Hines responded, ‘Do you want to be the guy that fixes the plane, or the guy that designs the plane?’13 This inspired Mueller to embark on his studies as a mechanical engineer. But to pay for this, he did what everybody in town did. He did what his own father did. He did what his future boss Elon Musk did. He worked as a lumberjack.

Whether it was a quest to establish his own boundaries or his version of manhood beyond just the pages of books such as The Lord of the Rings or Lord of the Flies – which Musk has suggested everybody should read – the young South African seemed to enjoy the hard manual jobs he took. And the element of danger in them.

Another job involved cleaning out the boiler room of a lumber mill. Musk took it purely on the basis that it paid well – $18 an hour. Traditionally, manual jobs pay well because they’re dangerous. Much like his experience in the grain bins, Musk would climb into the boiler and shovel out the steaming residue. He could only do this for about half an hour at a time before it became too hot, forcing him to climb out again.

But having spent time wandering around Canada doing odd jobs like his grandfather used to do, Musk decided it was time to settle down to his studies.

He enrolled at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and spent his freshman and sophomore years there from 1989 to 1991. After months of backbreaking manual labour, he clearly enjoyed his newfound freedom as a student. ‘I had a great time at Queen’s. It was fun and interesting. I’d call them formative years,’ he said in a 2013 interview with the Queen’s Alumni Review.14

Musk stayed in Victoria Hall, the largest of the university’s 17 residences, named after Queen Victoria. Coincidentally, the building’s architecture resembles a large X; perhaps this planted a seed in the mind of the future founder of a space exploration company he named SpaceX.

Musk enjoyed every aspect of his student years, and it laid the foundation for a way of thinking and working that would become his philosophy for success. ‘In the first two years at university, you learn a lot about a great many things. One particular thing that I learned at Queen’s – both from faculty and students – was how to work collaboratively with smart people and make use of the Socratic method to achieve commonality of purpose,’ he told the Queen’s Alumni Review.15

The Socratic method, named for the Greek philosopher Socrates, involves a constant dialogue between teacher and student in which the teacher asks a range of probing questions in order to engage the students in more critical thinking and the shaping of their own views rather than just accepting the transfer of knowledge from their teacher.

Musk would later merge this philosophy with the scientific method to develop his own approach to asking questions and problem-solving. In its simplest form, the Socratic method involves the questioning of another person, whereas the scientific method involves the questioning of nature. So the Socratic method has a more inward, interpersonal focus, while the scientific method focuses outward on the world around us. For Musk, if you want to approach a project such as sending people to a new planet, you need both methods in order to effectively mobilise the massive human resources required, as well as the ability to solve the scientific questions of inhabiting a new world completely foreign to Earth.

The Socratic method also shines through in Musk’s belief that when pursuing something that is important to you, you should ‘seek out negative feedback, because it gets harder and harder to get as you progress in the world’.16

And he used this most effectively in the creation of SpaceX. As Musk told the Queen’s Alumni Review, ‘It would have been quite difficult if I’d just started off by cold-calling them (scientists and rocket engineers) and saying that I wanted to start a rocket company. What I said instead – because these people were working at Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and other big aerospace companies – was “Would you mind helping me with a feasibility study to find out if it’s possible to make significant advancements in rocket technology? It will involve a few weekends and evenings of your time.” I said I’d pay a decent amount for their help, and so they were enthusiastic. We had a series of meetings, and the people I recruited put a lot of thought into it and came to the conclusion that yes, it would be possible to build better rockets than had been made before.

‘I essentially led them to a conclusion that they created. It was sort of a Socratic dialogue on a technical level. The essence of a Socratic dialogue is that people wind up convincing themselves. People are much more willing to change their opinion if you’re not forcing it.’17

But, ultimately, Musk’s decision to go to Queen’s was an interesting one forged by a far simpler desire, but one that is no less telling in terms of his childhood and the impact it had on him. Faced with the opportunity to attend Queen’s or the University of Waterloo, also in Ontario, Musk was swung not by a better academic programme or research facilities, but by a more basic desire: ‘I was going to do physics and engineering at Waterloo, but then I visited the campus … and, you may not want to print this, but there didn’t seem to be any girls there! So, I visited Queen’s, and there were girls there. I didn’t want to spend my undergraduate time with a bunch of dudes,’ he said in his 2013 alumni interview.18

As innocuous as this may seem at first, it does point to an innate desire on Musk’s part to find love. This is a man who perhaps finds it easier to build rockets and dream of taking people to Mars than he does to find love on Earth. ‘This may sound corny, but love is the answer,’ he said on the Joe Rogan podcast as he spoke about his love for humanity and belief in human goodness, and that these are things worth protecting.19 Lauded as the man who makes science fiction reality, and as much as he has embraced and lived in that world since he was a child, Musk is very much a man in love with the idea of what it means to be human. He has said all along that his desire is not to escape Earth but rather to protect it: ‘People think Mars is some kind of escape hatch for rich people. It’s not like that at all.’20 And more specifically, to protect that one thing he believes is unique in the entire universe – human consciousness.

Love and the impact it has on people pervades even some of his business motives. ‘How many things can you buy that you love, you know, that really give you joy? It’s so rare. So rare. I wish there were more things. That’s what we’re trying to do, to make things that somebody loves,’21 he says of Tesla and the goal of producing electric cars.

‘What are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? There need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning. You wake up in the morning and you look forward to the day … look forward to the future.’22 This is another way Musk has framed the thought process behind his ideas and constant drive for innovation. It is a process surprisingly lacking in strict capitalist desire from the world’s richest man.

And perhaps recalling a father who drove him to excellence at the expense of love, Musk has said one of his great motivators is ‘doing something useful for other people – that I like doing’.23 Whether it’s a love of ideas, a love of innovation, a love of making the world a better place or a love of humanity, Musk is right on point when he says, ‘Love is the answer.’

It’s an answer he has searched for since he was a child, and he has admitted that he grew up thinking, ‘I never want to be alone.’24 It’s an answer he took into every relationship and each of his three marriages. In his interview with Rolling Stone he declared, ‘If I’m not in love, if I’m not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy.’25

In an interview with Business Insider in March 2018, Errol declared, ‘What is driving Elon is trying to find the right girl, and that is very hard, probably the hardest thing on Earth, for you or for me, for anybody.’26

So there was an underlying motive to Musk’s decision to finally settle on Queen’s University. And it paid off. It was here that he met his first wife, Justine (Wilson), an 18-year-old arts student who qualified with a degree in English literature and went on to become an author of fantasy novels.

For Musk, if love was indeed the answer, Justine posed the first serious question of the awkward teen: how do I ask her out?
