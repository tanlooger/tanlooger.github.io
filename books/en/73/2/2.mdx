title: The American Dream

WHEN Justine Wilson first met Elon Musk, she was hardly impressed.

He was nothing like the kind of guy she liked to date. ‘He was a clean-cut, upper-class boy with a South African accent who appeared in front of me one afternoon as I was leaping up the steps to my dorm … He was a scientific type, at home with numbers, commerce and logic,’ she wrote in Marie Claire magazine.1

Her type was more the rebellious and tortured motorbike-riding, leather-jacketed, dark and stormy hero. Justine’s early recollections of Musk, though, are of somebody less obviously rebellious and more refined. She remembers him phoning her and always having classical music playing in the background: ‘He would ask me out, and I would say no. And he would call me up again and ask me out, and I would say no.’2

After telling Justine that he had first met her at a party she knew she hadn’t attended, Musk invited her out for an ice cream: ‘I said yes, but then blew him off with a note on my dorm-room door. Several hours later, my head bent over my Spanish text in an overheated room in the student centre, I heard a polite cough behind me. Elon was smiling awkwardly, two chocolate-chip ice-cream cones dripping down his hands,’3 she wrote.

Justine was attracted to the fact that Musk was never threatened by her ambition to become a novelist, and actively encouraged it: ‘Previous boyfriends complained that I was “competitive”, but Elon said I had “a fire in my soul”. When he told me, “I see myself in you”, I knew what he meant,’4 she wrote.

They began dating, but Musk was still set on his plans to move to the US. By now, Maye, Kimbal and Tosca had joined him in Canada. They lived in a small apartment in Toronto, and Maye has recalled how they lived so frugally that she would cut their hair for them.

It appears that Musk had always planned to bring his mother and siblings to Canada. Maye had come over to visit and consider the move but had decided to return home. However, she recalls that when she came back to South Africa, Tosca had made arrangements to sell her car and home, and Maye was simply presented with the paperwork to sign. Tosca felt there was no point in waiting for them all to join Elon.

After two years at Queen’s University, where his favourite class was astronomy,5 Elon transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (often shortened to UPenn), to begin studying physics. There was also a sense that he needed to attend one of the Ivy League universities to give his studies greater gravitas. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics from the university’s Wharton School, and a bachelor’s degree in physics from the university’s College of Arts and Sciences. It was at the latter that Musk was given the opportunity to test himself and flex his mental aptitude. He described his senior-year quantum mechanics course as ‘the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind.’6

Elon’s time at UPenn led Errol to share, years later, a story encapsulating the Musk family spirit. Cora Musk, Errol’s mother, was said to be a woman who loved her cards and her gin and tonic in equal measure, and was armed with a formidable sense of humour. Writing on Facebook, Errol recalled:


So, my mom and I are on our way to UPenn in West Philly [Philadelphia] to Elon’s rented (semi-demolished) old house next to UPenn. It’s Saturday night and dark. As we go along (using McNally maps those days) we get deeper and deeper into pretty bad looking places. With groups on every corner. I am hunched over the wheel. ‘Gotta get outta here, gotta get outta here,’ I’m thinking. We pull up at traffic lights, crowds on each corner. ‘Oh sh.t’, I think. My mom (75) rolls down her window.

‘Hello! Hello boys!’ she shouts to them on her side. The whole group comes over.

Oh no! I think.

My mom: ‘I’m British you know?’ she says to them. ‘We’re looking for Apple Street. My grandson Elon lives there. Do you know him? He’s very clever you know. So how do we get there?’

I’ve stopped thinking.

‘Oh don’t worry ma’am,’ says one giant guy. ‘We’ll show you. It’s just around the next bend. Follow us!’

So, they all jog along in front of the car as we follow them. Close? It was half a mile!

Finally, ‘Here it is, ma’am,’ they say.

‘Thank you, boys,’ says my mom, and rolls up her window and off we go to Elon! 7


The off-campus house was another move by Musk to develop more than just his mental abilities. He had shared a dorm room with Adeo Ressi, a close friend to this day. It was Ressi who convinced Musk that they should rent the house in pursuit of a better social life, which the dorm wasn’t providing. On the weekends, the house became a party venue as the two of them started to charge a cover fee for access to an all-you-can-drink student hangout. But amid what often was a chaotic, sometimes debauched place, a familiar theme emerged. According to Ressi, ‘Elon was the most straight-laced dude you have ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing.’8 This resonates with what Errol has said about his son’s aversion to alcohol and preference for a milkshake.

Throughout his time at UPenn, Musk kept in contact with Justine. He also began to expand on his own ideas, specifically his plans for sustainable energy through the use of solar power. When Justine graduated, she travelled to Japan to teach English as a second language (ESL). She spent a year there, while Musk also went his own way, and they lost contact. When she returned to Canada, Justine continued to pursue her writing while working as a bartender. Musk had by then moved to Silicon Valley in California, the epicentre of global technological innovation.

There was a brief time in 1995 when Musk allegedly enrolled and was accepted at Stanford University to study energy physics. But after just two days he says he decided to defer in light of his growing interest in the development of the Internet. According to Musk, ‘I talked to the chairman of the department and he let me go on deferment, and I said I’d probably be back in six months and he said he was probably never going to hear from me again, and he was correct. I’ve never spoken to him since.’9

However, the veracity of his Stanford link was challenged in court years later in 2009, when Martin Eberhard, one of the original founders of Tesla, sued Musk for what he alleged was slander pertaining to Eberhard’s true role in founding the company. In documents submitted in that trial, it is claimed that ‘In several national publications, Musk has allegedly misrepresented his affiliation with Stanford University, claiming to have “dropped out” of a PhD program at that university when in fact he was never enrolled at Stanford.’10

He may well, however, had had a letter of acceptance to attend Stanford University. In fact, Stanford president John Hennessy confirmed Musk’s recollection of events: ‘He arrived at Stanford to pursue his PhD in physics, but left after two days. I said, “What was wrong, Elon? Was it the food, the water, the weather?” No, he left to launch his first start-up – Zip2.’11

Attending university and racking up academic qualifications has never appealed to Musk, who has often been quoted as generally indifferent to the practical worth of a degree. He’s even made it a requirement in his companies not to let the lack of a university degree prevent the hiring of a potential employee who shows outstanding talent. This leads to the other theory that Musk’s time at university – in Canada and the United States – was more a part of his plan to get out of South Africa and into the United States. His Canadian citizenship and place at a respected Canadian university made it a lot easier to move to the United States; a Canadian passport counted for more than a South African one. Musk’s transfer to UPenn and later to the Wharton School meant he could show more time spent living in the United States, fulfilling the necessary immigration requirements. An acceptance letter from Stanford would have also lent more weight to the case for his eventually becoming a US citizen. More importantly, being accepted to study at Stanford meant he could move to California and work there. All of which builds on the theory that, much like his studies at the University of Pretoria, Musk’s university time in Canada and the United States was merely a vehicle for his ultimate objective – and stated childhood aim – of living and working in the United States. In itself, this is a prime example of Musk’s pragmatism and ability to achieve his objectives.

At this time, Musk also worked at a videogame company in Palo Alto – ten minutes from Silicon Valley – where he wrote a multitasker for PC in C++ that could basically read video from a CD while running a game at the same time. The name of that videogame company, ironically, was Rocket Science Games. It was a night job; during the day he worked on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research. Quite simply, electrical energy. Already, the seeds of his interest in electric cars, which would come to fruition in Tesla, had been planted.

‘But that summer I realised the Internet is going to be one of the biggest impactors on humanity, and communication will go from osmosis to humanity having like a nervous system where you could access any part of humanity’s knowledge from any connection anywhere. I wanted to be a part of creating that,’ he said.12

He tried to get a job with Netscape, creator of the first widely successful browser for what was then known as the World Wide Web. ‘I actually wasn’t sure what I wanted to do growing up. I think at one point I thought inventing stuff or creating things would be a cool thing to do. But I wasn’t really sure if that meant starting a company or whether that meant working for a company that made cool stuff,’ Musk said.13 ‘In 1995, I thought the Internet would be something that would change the world in a major way and I wanted to be a part of it. Actually, what I first tried to do, was I tried to get a job at Netscape. I wouldn’t actually try to start a company, I’d try to get a job at Netscape.

‘I didn’t get any reply. I mean I had a physics and economics degree, or physics and business degree, from Wharton, and I was doing grad studies in applied physics and materials science. I guess that … I mean, I didn’t have a computer science degree or several years working at a software company. For whatever reason, I didn’t get a reply from Netscape and I actually tried hanging out in the lobby, but I was too shy to talk to anyone. So I’m just like standing in the lobby. It was pretty embarrassing. I was just sort of standing there trying to see if there’s someone I could talk to and then I just couldn’t, I couldn’t … I was too scared to talk to anyone. So then I left.’14

Saddled with $100 000 in student debt, Musk decided that the only way open for him to become a part of the Internet revolution was to start his own Internet company. And so, with a little over $2 000 and a computer, and renting office space where he also lived because it was cheaper than an apartment, and showering at the Page Mill YMCA in Palo Alto, Musk began writing software.

From Pretoria, Musk had travelled right into the heart of his science-fiction dreams and made them a reality. He was now in the world – and the literal neighbourhood – that birthed Hewlett-Packard in the late 1930s, Bell Labs in the 1940s and Intel in the 1960s. Then, in 1969, the nearby Stanford Research Institute was involved in the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a government research project. It was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a division within the US Department of Defense. ARPANET’s purpose was to link computers at the Pentagon and its research institutions via telephone lines, and using the very same device – a modem – that so captured Musk’s imagination as a boy, and which he told his father about.

ARPANET eventually became the Internet. And Silicon Valley exploded with innovation. The 1970s saw the birth of technology companies such as Apple, Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), Atari and Oracle. By the 1980s, Silicon Valley was the acknowledged centre of the global computer industry. In the 1990s, eBay emerged, as did Google and Yahoo.

And into this world came a kid from South Africa.

‘I just started writing software,’ said Musk.15

And to all of these giant technology companies in Silicon Valley was added a little-known outfit called the Global Link Information Network – Musk’s first technology company. The name would later be changed to Zip2. It was a company that put the Yellow and White Pages on the Internet, with maps. A searchable business directory that was primarily used by the newspaper industry, with The New York Times as its first client. In its most simplistic description, Musk felt that everybody should be able to find their nearest pizza place, and how to get there.

‘I actually wrote the first maps and directions on the Internet – the first White Pages and the first Yellow Pages – by myself. Then we hired a few interns, and then my brother [Kimbal] joined. And another friend of mine – Greg Kouri, who has passed away. And then we got some venture funding. I thought it was crazy that these guys gave us $3 million. It was just us and some interns.’16

The American Dream had become real for Musk.

The seed that had been planted when he saw his first computer, the discussions a young boy had had with those experts from England addressing adults about the first computers at the University of the Witwatersrand and that magical blinking light of a modem had all brought him to this point.

From the valley of global technological innovation, Musk could now see clearly before him the mountaintops he wanted to climb.
