title: chapter 10.

Before I could process this, Riley roared out an animalistic shriek of rage. He was staring down at the ashy remains on the floor, his eyes bulging in fury. Everyone stood silent, immobile. We’d all seen Riley lose his temper, but this was something different.

Riley spun and raked his fingers through a blaring speaker, then ripped it from the wall and hurled it across the room. Jen and Kristie dodged out of the way as it exploded into the far wall, sending up a cloud of pulverized drywall dust. Riley smashed the sound system with his foot, and the thudding bass went silent. Then he leaped to where Raoul stood, and grabbed him by the throat.

“I wasn’t even here!” Raoul yelled, looking afraid—I’d never seen that before.

Riley growled hideously and threw Raoul as he’d thrown the speaker. Jen and Kristie jumped out of the way again. Raoul’s body crashed right through the wall, leaving an enormous hole.

Riley caught Kevin by the shoulder and—with a familiar screech—ripped off his right hand. Kevin cried out in pain and tried to twist out of Riley’s grip. Riley kicked him in the side. Another harsh shriek and Riley had the rest of Kevin’s arm. He tore the arm in half at the elbow and threw the pieces hard into Kevin’s anguished face—smack, smack, smack, like a hammer striking stone.

“What is wrong with you?” Riley screamed at us. “Why are you all so stupid?” He made a grab for the blond Spider-Man kid, but that kid leaped out of his way. His jump left him too close to Fred, and he stumbled back toward Riley again, gagging.

“Do any of you have a brain?”

Riley smacked a kid named Dean into the entertainment center, shattering it, then caught another girl—Sara—and tore her left ear and a handful of hair from her head. She snarled in anguish.

It became suddenly obvious that Riley was doing a very dangerous thing. There were a lot of us in here. Already Raoul was back, with Kristie and Jen—usually his enemies—flanking him defensively. A few others banded together in clusters around the room.

I wasn’t sure if Riley was aware of the threat or if his rant came to an end naturally. He took a deep breath. He tossed Sara her ear and the hair. She recoiled away from him, licking the torn edge of her ear, coating it with venom so that it would reattach. There was no remedy for the hair, though; Sara was going to have a bald spot.

“Listen to me!” Riley said, quiet but fierce. “All our lives depend on you listening to what I’m saying now and thinking! We are all going to die. Every one of us, you and me, too, if you can’t act like you have brains for just a few short days!”

This was nothing like his usual lectures and pleadings for control. He definitely had everyone’s attention.

“It’s time for you to grow up and take responsibility for yourselves. Do you think you get to live like this for free? That all the blood in Seattle doesn’t have a price?”

The little clusters of vampires no longer seemed threatening. Everyone was wide-eyed, some exchanging mystified glances. I saw Fred’s head turn toward me in my peripheral vision, but I didn’t meet his gaze. My attention was focused on two things: Riley, just in case he started to attack again, and the door. The door that was still closed.

“Are you listening now? Really listening?” Riley paused, but no one nodded. The room was very still. “Let me explain to you the precarious situation we are all in. I’ll try to keep it simple for the slowest ones. Raoul, Kristie, come here.”

He motioned to the leaders of the two largest gangs, allied for this brief moment against him. Neither of them moved toward him. They braced themselves, Kristie baring her teeth.

I expected Riley to soften, to apologize. To placate them and then persuade them to do what he wanted. But this was a different Riley.

“Fine,” he snapped. “We’re going to need leaders if we’re going to survive, but apparently neither of you is up to the task. I thought you had aptitude. I was wrong. Kevin, Jen, please join me as the heads of this team.”

Kevin looked up in surprise. He had just finished putting his arm back together. Though his expression was wary, it was also unmistakably flattered. He slowly got to his feet. Jen looked at Kristie as if waiting for permission. Raoul ground his teeth together.

The door at the top of the stairs did not open.

“Are you not able, either?” Riley asked, irritated.

Kevin took a step toward Riley, but then Raoul rushed him, leaping across the long room in two low bounds. He shoved Kevin against the wall without a word and then stood by Riley’s right shoulder.

Riley permitted himself a tiny smile. The manipulation wasn’t subtle, but it was effective.

“Kristie or Jen, who will lead us?” Riley asked with a hint of amusement in his voice.

Jen was still waiting for a sign from Kristie as to what she should do. Kristie glowered at Jen for an instant, then flipped her sandy hair out of her face and darted to stand on Riley’s other side.

“That took too long to decide,” Riley said seriously. “We don’t have the luxury of time. We don’t get to fool around anymore. I’ve let you all do pretty much whatever you feel like, but that ends tonight.”

He looked around the room, meeting everyone’s eyes, making sure we were listening. I held his gaze for only a second when it was my turn, and then my eyes flipped back to the door. I corrected instantly, but his glare had moved on. I wondered if he’d noticed my slip. Or had he seen me at all, here beside Fred?

“We have an enemy,” Riley announced. He let that sink in for a moment. I could tell the idea was shocking to several of the vampires in the basement. The enemy was Raoul—or if you were with Raoul, the enemy was Kristie. The enemy was here, because the whole world was here. The thought that there were other forces out there strong enough to affect us was new for most. Would have been new to me, too, yesterday.

“A few of you might be smart enough to have realized that if we exist, so do other vampires. Other vampires who are older, smarter… more talented. Other vampires who want our blood!”

Raoul hissed, and then several of his followers echoed him in support.

“That’s right,” Riley said, seeming intent on egging them on. “Seattle was once theirs, but they moved on a long time ago. Now they know about us, and they are jealous of the easy blood they used to have here. They know it belongs to us now, but they want to take it back. They are coming after what they want. One by one, they’ll hunt us down! We’ll burn while they feast!”

“Never,” Kristie growled. Some of hers and some of Raoul’s growled, too.

“We don’t have a lot of choices,” Riley told us. “If we wait for them to show up here, they will have the advantage. This is their turf, after all. And they don’t want to face us head-on, because we outnumber them and we are stronger than they are. They want to catch us separated; they want to take advantage of our biggest weakness. Are any of you smart enough to know what that is?” He pointed at the ashes at his feet—now smeared into the carpet and unrecognizable as a former vampire—and waited.

No one moved.

Riley made a disgusted sound. “Unity!” he shouted. “We don’t have it! What kind of a threat can we pose when we won’t stop killing each other?” He kicked the dust, sending up a small black cloud. “Can you imagine them laughing at us? They think taking the city from us will be easy. That we’re weak with stupidity! That we’ll just hand them our blood.”

Half the vampires in the room snarled in protest now.

“Can you work together, or do we all die?”

“We can take them, boss,” Raoul growled.

Riley scowled at him. “Not if you can’t control yourself! Not if you can’t cooperate with every single person in this room. Anyone you take out”—his toe nudged the ashes again—“might be the one who could have kept you alive. Every one of your coven that you kill is like handing our enemies a gift. Here, you’re saying, take me down!”

Kristie and Raoul exchanged a glance as if they were seeing each other for the first time. Others did the same. The word coven was not unfamiliar, but none of us had applied it to our group before. We were a coven.

“Let me tell you about our enemies,” Riley said, and all eyes locked on his face. “They are a much older coven than we are. They’ve been around for hundreds of years, and they’ve survived that long for a reason. They are crafty and they are skilled and they are coming to retake Seattle with confidence—because they’ve heard the only ones they’ll have to fight for it are a bunch of disorganized children who will do half their work for them!”

More growls, but some were less angry than they were wary. A few of the quieter vampires, the ones Riley would have called tamer, looked skittish.

Riley noticed that, too. “This is how they see us, but that’s because they can’t see us together. Together, we can crush them. If they could see all of us, side by side, fighting together, they would be terrified. And that’s how they’re going to see us. Because we’re not going to wait for them to show up here and start picking us off. We’re going to ambush them. In four days.”

Four days? I guessed our creator didn’t want to cut it too close to the deadline. I looked at the closed door again. Where was Diego?

Others reacted to the deadline with surprise, some with fear.

“It’s the last thing they’ll expect,” Riley assured us. “All of us—together—waiting for them. And I’ve saved the best part for last. There are only seven of them.”

There was an instant of incredulous silence.

Then Raoul said, “What?”

Kristie stared at Riley with the same disbelieving expression, and I heard muttered whispers around the room.

“Seven?”

“Are you kidding me?”

“Hey,” Riley snapped. “I wasn’t joking when I said this coven is dangerous. They are wise and… devious. Underhanded. We will have power on our side; they will have deception. If we play it their way, they will win. But if we take it to them on our terms…” Riley didn’t finish, he just smiled.

“Let’s go now,” Raoul urged. “Let’s get ’em out of the picture fast.” Kevin growled enthusiastically.

“Slow down, moron. Rushing into things blind isn’t going to help us win,” Riley chided him.

“Tell us everything we need to know about them,” Kristie encouraged, shooting Raoul a superior look.

Riley hesitated, as if deciding how to word something. “All right, where to begin? I guess the first thing you need to know is… that you don’t know everything there is to know about vampires yet. I didn’t want to overwhelm you in the beginning.” Another pause while everyone looked confused. “You have a little bit of experience with what we call ‘talents.’ We have Fred.”

Everyone looked at Fred—or rather they tried to. I could tell from Riley’s expression that Fred did not like being singled out. It looked like Fred had really turned up the volume on his “talent,” as Riley called it. Riley cringed and looked away quickly. I still didn’t feel anything.

“Yes, well, there are some vampires who have gifts beyond the usual super strength and super senses. You’ve seen one aspect in… our coven.” He was careful not to say Fred’s name again. “Gifts are rare—one in fifty, maybe—but every one is different. There’s a huge range of gifts out there, and some of them are more powerful than others.”

I could hear a lot of murmurs now as people wondered if they might be talented. Raoul was preening like he’d already decided he was gifted. As far as I could tell, the only one around here that was in any way special was standing next to me.

“Pay attention!” Riley commanded. “I’m not telling you this for entertainment.”

“This enemy coven,” Kristie interjected. “They’re talented. Right?”

Riley gave her an approving nod. “Exactly. I’m glad someone here can connect the dots.”

Raoul’s upper lip twitched back over his teeth.

“This coven is dangerously talented,” Riley went on, his voice dropping to a hushed whisper. “They have a mind reader.” He examined our faces, looking to see if we got the importance of this revelation. He didn’t seem satisfied with his assessment. “Think, guys! He’ll know everything in your head. If you attack, he’ll know what move you’re going to make before you know it. You go left, he’ll be waiting.”

There was a nervous stillness as everyone imagined this.

“This is why we’ve been so careful—me, and the one who created you.”

Kristie flinched away from Riley when he mentioned her. Raoul looked angrier. Nerves strained universally.

“You don’t know her name, and you don’t know what she looks like. This protects us all. If they’d stumbled across one of you alone, they wouldn’t realize that you were connected to her, and they might have let you be. If they knew you were part of her coven, there would be no delay in your execution.”

That didn’t make sense to me. Didn’t the secrecy protect her more than it protected any of us? Riley hurried on before we had too long to examine his statement.

“Of course, it doesn’t matter now that they’ve decided to move on Seattle. We will surprise them on their way in, and we will annihilate them.” He whistled a single low note through his teeth. “Done. And then not only is the city all ours, other covens will know not to mess with us. We won’t have to be so careful to cover our tracks anymore. As much blood as you want, for everyone. Hunting every night. We’ll move right into the city, and we will rule it.”

The growls and snarls were like applause. Everyone was with him. Except for me. I didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. Neither did Fred, but who knows why that was?

I was not with Riley because his promises sounded like lies. Or else my whole line of logic had been wrong. Riley said it was only these enemies that kept us from hunting without caution or restraint. But that didn’t go along with the fact that all other vampires must have been discreet, or humans would have known about them long ago.

I couldn’t concentrate to work it out, because the door at the top of the stairs had not moved. Diego…

“We have to do this together, though. Today I’m going to lead you through some techniques. Fighting techniques. There’s more to this than just scuffling around on the floor like toddlers. When it gets dark, we’ll go outside and practice. I want you to practice hard, but keep your focus. I am not losing another member of this coven! We all need each other—every one of us. I will not tolerate any more stupidity. If you think you don’t have to listen to me, you are wrong.” He paused for a short second, the muscles in his face shifting into a new arrangement. “And you will learn how wrong you are when I take you to her”—I shuddered and felt the tremor through the room as everyone else did, too—“and hold you while she tears off your legs and then slowly, slowly burns off your fingers, ears, lips, tongue, and every other superfluous appendage one by one.”

We’d all lost a limb, at least, and we’d all burned when we became vampires, so we could easily imagine how that would feel, but it wasn’t the threat itself that was so terrifying. The truly scary thing was Riley’s face as he said it. His face was not twisted in rage, the way it usually was when he was angry; it was calm and cold, smooth and beautiful, his mouth curled at the edges into a small smile. I suddenly had the impression that this was a new Riley. Something had changed him, hardened him, but I couldn’t imagine what could have happened in one night to create that cruel, perfect smile.

I looked away, shivering a little, and saw as Raoul’s smile shifted to echo Riley’s. I could almost see the gears turning in Raoul’s head. He wouldn’t kill his victims so quickly in the future.

“Now, let’s get some teams figured out so that we can work in groups,” Riley said, his face normal again. “Kristie, Raoul, get your kids together and then divvy up the rest evenly. No fighting! Show me you can do this rationally. Prove yourselves.”

He walked away from those two, ignoring the fact that they fell almost immediately into bickering, and made an arc around the outside edge of the room. He touched a few vampires on the shoulder as he passed, nudging them toward one of the new leaders or the other. I didn’t realize at first that he was heading in my direction, because he took such a wide way around.

“Bree,” he said, squinting toward where I stood. It looked like this took some effort.

I felt like a block of ice. He must have smelled my trail. I was dead.

“Bree?” he said, softer now. His voice reminded me of the first time he’d talked to me. When he was nice to me. And then even lower, “I promised Diego I’d give you a message. He said to tell you it was a ninja thing. Does that make any sense to you?”

He still couldn’t look at me, but he was edging closer.

“Diego?” I murmured. I couldn’t help myself.

Riley smiled a tiny bit. “Can we talk?” He jerked his head toward the door. “I double-checked all the windows. The first floor is totally dark and safe.”

I knew I wouldn’t be as safe once I walked away from Fred, but I had to hear what Diego had wanted to tell me. What had happened? I should have stayed with him to meet Riley.

I followed Riley through the room, keeping my head down. He gave Raoul a few instructions, nodded to Kristie, and then went up the stairs. From the corners of my eyes I saw a few people curiously watch the direction he was going.

Riley passed through the door first, and the kitchen of the home was, as he’d promised, totally black. He motioned for me to keep following and led me through a dark hall past a few open bedroom doors, then through another door with a dead bolt. We ended up in the garage.

“You’re brave,” he commented in a very low voice. “Or really trusting. I thought it would be more work to get you upstairs with the sun up.”

Whoops. I should have been more skittish. Too late now. I shrugged.

“So you and Diego are pretty tight, right?” he asked, just breathing the words. Probably, if everyone were silent in the basement, they would still be able to hear him, but it was pretty noisy down there right now.

I shrugged again. “He saved my life,” I whispered.

Riley lifted his chin, almost but not quite a nod, and appraised. Did he believe me? Did he think I still feared the day?

“He’s the best,” Riley said. “The smartest kid I’ve got.”

I nodded once.

“We had a little meeting about the situation. We agreed that we need some surveillance. Going in blind is too dangerous. He’s the only one I trust to scout ahead.” He exhaled, almost angrily. “Wish I had two of him! Raoul’s got too short a fuse and Kristie is too self-absorbed to get the big picture, but they’re the best I’ve got, and I’ll have to make do. Diego said you were smart, too.”

I waited, not sure how much of our story Riley knew.

“I need your help with Fred. Wow, that kid is strong! I couldn’t even look at him tonight.”

I nodded cautiously again.

“Imagine if our enemies can’t even look at us. It will be so easy!”

I didn’t think Fred would like that idea, but maybe I was wrong. He didn’t seem like he cared anything for this coven of ours. Would he want to save us? I didn’t respond to Riley.

“You spend a lot of time with him.”

I shrugged. “Nobody bothers me there. It’s not easy.”

Riley pursed his lips and nodded. “Smart, like Diego said.”

“Where is Diego?”

I shouldn’t have asked. The words just ripped out of their own accord. I waited anxiously, trying to look indifferent and most likely failing.

“We don’t have time to waste. I sent him south the second I found out what was coming. If our enemies decide to attack early, we need the advance warning. Diego will meet up with us when we move against them.”

I tried to imagine where Diego was now. I wished I were there with him. Maybe I could talk him out of doing Riley’s bidding and putting himself in the line of fire in the process. But maybe not. It seemed like Diego was thick with Riley, just like I’d worried.

“Diego wanted me to tell you something.”

My eyes snapped to his face. Too fast, too eager. Blew it again.

“Sounded like nonsense to me. He said, ‘Tell Bree I’ve got the handshake figured out. I’ll show her in four days, when we meet up.’ I have no idea what that means. Do you?”

I tried to force a poker face. “Maybe. He did say something about needing a secret handshake. For his underwater cave. Some kind of password. He was just kidding around, though. I’m not sure what he means now.”

Riley chuckled. “Poor Diego.”

“What?”

“I think that kid likes you a lot more than you like him.”

“Oh.” I looked away, confused. Was Diego giving me this message as a way to let me know I could trust Riley? But he hadn’t told Riley I knew about the sun. Still, he must have trusted Riley to tell him so much, to show Riley that he cared about me. I thought it would be wiser to keep my mouth shut, though. Too much had changed.

“Don’t write him off yet, Bree. He’s the best, like I said. Give him a chance.”

Riley was giving me romantic advice? This could not get weirder. I bobbed my head once and muttered, “Sure.”

“See if you can talk to Fred. Make sure he’s on board.”

I shrugged. “I’ll do what I can.”

Riley smiled. “Great. I’ll pull you aside before we leave, and you can tell me how it went. I’ll keep it casual, not like tonight. I don’t want him to feel like I’m spying on him.”

“Okay.”

Riley motioned for me to follow and then headed back to the basement.

The training lasted all day, but I wasn’t part of it. After Riley went back to his team leaders, I took my spot beside Fred. The others had been divided up into four groups of four, with Raoul and Kristie directing them. No one had picked Fred for a side, or maybe he’d ignored them, or maybe they couldn’t even see that he was there. I could still see him. He stood out—the only one not participating, a big blond elephant in the room.

I had no desire to insinuate myself into either Raoul’s team or Kristie’s, so I just watched. No one seemed to notice that I was sitting out with Fred. Though we must have been somewhat invisible, thanks to talented Fred, I felt horribly obvious. I wished I were invisible to myself—that I could see the illusion so that I could trust it. But no one noticed us, and after a while I could almost relax.

I watched the practicing closely. I wanted to know everything, just in case. I wasn’t planning on fighting; I was planning on finding Diego and making a break for it. But what if Diego wanted to fight? Or what if we had to fight to get away from the rest? Better to pay attention.

Only once did anyone ask about Diego. It was Kevin, but I had a sense that Raoul had put him up to it.

“So, did Diego end up getting fried after all?” Kevin asked in a forced joking tone.

“Diego’s with her,” Riley said, and no one had to ask who he meant. “Surveillance.”

A few people shuddered. No one said anything more about Diego.

Was he really with her? I cringed at the thought. Maybe Riley was just saying that to keep people from questioning him. He probably didn’t want Raoul getting jealous and feeling second best when Riley needed him at his most arrogant today. I couldn’t be sure, and I wasn’t going to ask. I kept quiet, as usual, and watched the training.

In the end, watching was boring, thirsty work. Riley didn’t give his army a break for three days and two nights straight. During the daytime it was harder to stay out of the mix—we all were crammed so tightly into the basement. It made things easier in one way for Riley—he could usually catch a fight before it got ugly. Outside at night, they had more room to really work around each other, but Riley was kept busy darting back and forth to catch limbs and get them back to their owners quickly. He kept his temper well, and he’d been smart enough to find all the lighters this time. I would have bet that this would spin out of control, that we’d lose at least a couple of coven members with Raoul and Kristie skirmishing head to head for days on end. But Riley had better control of them than I had thought possible.

Still, it was mostly repetition. I noticed Riley saying the same things over and over and over again. Work together, watch your back, don’t go at her head-on; work together, watch your back, don’t go at him head-on; work together, watch your back, don’t go at her head-on. It was kind of ridiculous, really, and made the group seem exceptionally stupid. But I was sure I would have been just as stupid if I’d been in the thick of the fight with them rather than watching calmly from the sidelines with Fred.

It reminded me in a way of how Riley had drilled into us our fear of the sun. Constant repetition.

Still, it was so dull that after about ten hours that first day, Fred produced a deck of cards and started playing solitaire. That was more interesting than watching the same mistakes over and over again, so I mostly watched him.

After about another twelve hours—we were inside again—I nudged Fred to point out a red five that he could move over. He nodded and made the change. After that hand, he dealt out the cards to both of us, and we played rummy. We never spoke, but Fred smiled a few times. No one ever looked our way or asked us to join in.

There were no hunting breaks, and as time went on, this got harder and harder to ignore. Fights broke out more regularly and with less provocation. Riley’s commands got more shrill, and he tore off two arms himself. I tried to forget the burning thirst as much as possible—after all, Riley must have been getting thirsty, too, so this couldn’t last forever—but mostly thirst was the only thing on my mind. Fred was looking pretty strained.

Early into the third night—one more day to go, and when I thought about the ticking clock it tied my empty stomach into knots—Riley called all the mock fights to a halt.

“Round it up, kids,” he told us, and everyone moved into a loose half-circle facing him. The original gangs all stood close together, so the practicing hadn’t changed any of those alliances. Fred put the cards in his back pocket and stood up. I stood close to his side, counting on his repulsive aura to hide me.

“You’ve done well,” Riley told us. “Tonight, you get a reward. Drink up, because tomorrow you’re going to want your strength.”

Snarls of relief from almost everyone.

“I say want and not need for a reason,” Riley went on. “I think you guys have got this. You’ve stayed smart and worked hard. Our enemies aren’t going to know what’s hit them!”

Kristie and Raoul growled, and both of their companies followed suit immediately. I was surprised to see it, but they did look like an army in that moment. Not that they were marching in formation or anything, but there was just something uniform about the response. Like they all were part of one big organism. As always, Fred and I were the glaring exceptions, but I thought only Riley was even the slightest bit aware of us—every now and then his eyes would scan across where we were standing, almost like he was checking to make sure he still felt Fred’s talent. And Riley didn’t seem to mind that we weren’t joining up. For now, anyway.

“Um, you mean tomorrow night, right, boss?” Raoul clarified.

“Right,” Riley said with a strange little smile. It didn’t seem like anyone else noticed anything off in his reply—except for Fred. He looked down at me with one eyebrow raised. I shrugged.

“You ready for your reward?” Riley asked.

His little army roared in response.
